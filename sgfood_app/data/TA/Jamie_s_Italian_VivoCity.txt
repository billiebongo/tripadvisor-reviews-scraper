We were there for a dinner date and the staff were really awesome, providing great and friendly service. The place was not noisy despite its crowd. The lighting set a comfortable and warm mood. We will definitely visit again!
4
Excellent service from booking on line to service at the place. Food is good and substantial though not fine dining.
The house pour were good quality.
5
Server was attentive and full of smiles. Food was great and the chocolate pudding was divine. It would be good if the food items for the set menu can be offered on the ala carte menu though.
5
House wine, nice and sweet
Rich lasagne, tasty
Flash steak, yum,
Starter, very good portion and flavour
4
Came to here particularly for one reason, Jamie, the name of the chef so we hope for the good meal quality. And yes, the quality of the food was so good. And enjoyable lunch for me.
4
Brilliant service from the Departmental Manager - Brian Wong and excellent service from the staff.
Pizza is excellent
Price is on the high side.
3
Service was good and we were attended to promptly. However, we found the food was lacking in flavour and taste.

We made a reservation for dinner for two the night before our dinner. When we arrived, we were assigned a seat next to another couple. The seat was directly under the air conditioner thus it was cold. We requested for a change of seat, and were told that we could not, as reserved seats were preallocated. This was despite the fact there were still empty seats at the restaurant. The staff were, however, kind enough to offer us showls. When the couple beside us left, to our surprise they mentioned they too were given the same seats as us when they arrived and they requested to change successfully. To make matters worse, the next couple who arrived after us, arguably when the restaurant was more crowded at 8pm, were given the option to choose between a two-person and a four-person seat! This happened while we were still having our meal. This discrepancy and double standard left a jarringly bitter aftertaste to an otherwise delicious meal.

Things ranks up there with one of the places I’ve had shocking service from. We arrived mid afternoon, there were about only four tables with customers when we arrived. We were sat down and we waited, and waited. Other people came in after us, were sat down served and had their meal, and still we waited. We caught a waitress a couple of times, but were told someone would be along soon. We asked if we could even get some water, but again that person couldn’t give it to us, we had to wait for someone else to bring it to us, even thought the person we asked seemed to go and serve water to another table. Eventually we ordered. The reason for my score of two is because the food tasted good, so credit to the chef only. We ordered everything at once whilst we had their attention. The fruit based cocktail my daughter got was that sweet she couldn’t drink it, very disappointing. I ordered the Tiramisu martini, it’s one of those places where the waitress doesn’t write down your order, unsure why. Anyway I was bought what looked like an espresso martini, and she called it that as she put it down. I queried if it was what I ordered and she got annoyed and took it away. About fifteen minutes later I was bought the correct drink, but she tried to pass the first one off to me as what I had ordered. It was well over priced there and I left thinking we won’t return to a Jamie’s again.

After visiting newly opened Jamie’s Italian at Bangkok we were more than ready to visit Singapore Jamie’s; however, in contrast to Bangkok the Singapore branch was a total disappointment. Quality of food was fair, prices were more than premium. Honestly strange to face such contrast. Our visits to both restaurant took place during one week, so contrast was more than visible
4
Love the Food and the varieties offered. Service offered by waitresses were good and they were friendly and helpful. Will come back again.
5
This is a great restaurant, visited with family. The pasta is very good. Though we didn't like the ravioli. Pizzas were excellent.
4
Served gluten free pasta.
Food quality and quantity is good.
The only thing is that the seating arrangement is quite bad at this place otherwise customer service and all are great.
4
Good and Fast service. Good foods and drinks, not traditional Italian but very casual. little over priced dessert.
4
Try crispy mushroom with garlic mayo (good complement), seared tuna, tiramisu (dense with right dose of kahlua)
5
My girlfriend and I visit Jamie’s for the 2nd time. The service is fantastic and warm, and the food served is amazing. Rich in flavor and looks amazing! Must try!
3
My fiancée and I had the spaghetti vongole and the flash steak and fries. The spaghetti was clearly been cooked quite some time back as it was stuck together bunches. Also, the clams didn’t taste very fresh leaving a strong after taste. The steak was not fantastic as the taste came mainly from the garlic butter and not the marinate of the steak. Menu was dirty with food stains on it
3
Had their set lunch, waiter was very attentive to my gluten free & lactose intolerance situation. Service is great but food is just average. I had the sea bass, the combination of quinoa/eggplant with tomato base is not strong enough to bring out the taste, a little blend. However my friend had the chicken burger & it was good
5
We were lucky to get a table as the rain poured down outside!! We had a super evening. I had a mixed mushroom pizza which was superb and my wife had a penne pasta dish. I had a Tiger beer and my wife enjoyed a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. The staff were very attentive and friendly. Good value and very pleasant evening
3
Great Hang out with frens..but waiter then will keep asking if they could clear the plates when we are chatting
4
Food is good. Either flavor, seasoning or presentations is excellent. We always like their spice fries and garlic bread. Pizza is a bit dry; meat slice on the topping help the flavor indeed greatly. Drink is overpriced
3
Do not order the Flash Steak as it was tough as rubber, dry and tasteless. Other items which we took tasted ok, not as nice as it was before.
2
I've been to Jamie's Italian in Dubai and Cyprus and this is the worst one yet. The portions are really small, and the ingredients not so fresh. We had the superfood salad, one pasta, one pizza and a burger to share. The fungi pizza was the only dish that was somewhat above average. The lemon meringue cheesecake was half the size compared to the one served in other countries and the meringue was more like old cream than light and fluffy. Very disappointing
5
We had a rather wonderful diningexperience at Jamie’s Italian (Vivo city) last night and made even more wonderful by the presence of the JM Brian who went out of his way to make sure our visit was memorable.The food was excellent (special mention for the steak and sweet potato fries), service slick and friendly and delighted with my Jamie’s Singapore jute bag - no need for dessert when you have a new bag : )We will be back soon...
3
First time to this place. After going thru the menu, decided to take the recommendation of the staff that served us. The staff was very friendly, helpful and not pushy at all. Took time to explain the sharing menu and answer our queries. We accepted his recommended "2 to share" comprising ribs, garlic bread, cheese filled nachos and vongole pasta. All 4 items were served at the same time. All tasted good. The only downside is that as we started with the bread, the pasta and ribs started to cool. Aircon was cold. So we decided to eat both the ribs and pasta together. We left the nachos till the end. No space for dessert as the ribs were filling and came with mash potato and broccoli.This place is very popular. Very crowded but still feels quite comfortable. Overall, the food is alright and service is good. We'll come back to try again
5
Our 4 year olds ate fresh veggies!!! in pizza!!! yes, we were able to make our boys eat fresh veggies without much trouble, it was how good the food was! and because the boys loved the food and ate by themselves, we immensely enjoyed the meal too. Food was really delicious, ambiance was excellent--relaxed and chill and service, polite and pleasant. Over-all it was a great dining experience
5
We've recently celebrated our daughter's 8th birthday at Jamie's Italian @ Vivocity. It was smooth sailing from planning to execution, especially since we planned the party on short notice (less than a week before).From the pizza making, herb garden tour, to the introductory session to pasta making, everything was made to ensure a great experience. Some of our guests were late, so the party managers (Ren and Kim) adapted by having the herb garden tour first. The kids had a blast creating their own pizzas and it was all delicious no matter how messily the pizzas were made! The pizzas were, however, topped by the amazing food.I must highlight how attentive and professional the party managers, Ren and Kim, were. It felt like they knew exactly when and how to make sure things were going smoothly while keeping us happy to enjoy ourselves with little intervention. In fact, one of the kids threw up due to an upset stomach from before the party, and the staff immediately cleaned it up like clockwork to ensure as little interruption to the party as possible.Major props to the Ren and Kim, and to the rest of the staff for the wonderful time! Our guests were as impressed as we were

I’ve long wanted to try out this place. So much hype about Jamie Oliver’s restaurant, located by the beautiful waterfront facing Sentosa, which lends a romantic flavor to the dining experience. My verdict: very good! It isn’t just hype. Despite having a limited menu, food quality is assured, as they use fresh ingredients daily. Highly recommended from my last visit are the ff: chicken ceasar salad, simple margherita pizza and The Jamie’s Italian Burger. Warning on the burger with its large size, made of thick beef patty, large slice of tomato, artisan cheddar cheese, special house sauce, balsamic onions and pancetta (Italian bacon). Best part is the service. Kudos to the waiter who reminded me that I ordered 3 mains for 2 people, and I may have more food than we can finish. With that type of honesty, this restaurant earned my trust. Definitely worth a revisit
4
Second time to Jamie's and the food was enjoyable, although it would have been better if the restaurant could have informed us beforehand that the full menu wasn't available that week. My friend and I were looking forward to ordering the vongole and arancini, only to find out that both were not available that day. Nonetheless, the service provided by 1 of the staff was really good and attentive. She realised that I was getting cold while waiting for my friend and offered a blanket to keep warm, thank you
5
Reservation went well. Service was prompt and we did not have to wait long for the food to be ready, even though it was a full house. Quality of food is high, and has its unique flavouring and style that differentiate it from its competitors. A bit pricy, but worth the experience.
5
Excellent food from a special New Year lunch set with options for starters/mains/dessert. Portions are generous.
4
Jamie's at Vivo City is one of our regular haunts. The pizzas and pastas are generally yummy but it is the service that takes the cake. Kudos to the crew!
4
Pasta was yummy. Fragrant black truffle sauce. However, the other mains such as the pork belly and the flash grilled steak were average.
1
Food was great,nice ambience BUT poor service.the waitress wandering,had to ask a few times just wanted can of soft drink and beer,we will never go back to this location again
1
Went for Christmas dinner.. service staffs are not friendly and rude. Food was cold and tasteless. Sent an email for them but still I am waiting for them to get back to me. Better spend your money elsewhere!
4
My wife and I have started loving Jamie's Italian. The menu is great, even for us vegetarians! The servers are friendly and adjust the dishes to suit our requirements. Orders are filled within reasonable time. We really liked Ronica a server at the Vivo City branch. Since this restaurant was introduced to us a few months ago by a friend, we have visited it twice and hope to visit more. I really liked the $65 set menu. My wife and I ordered this twice and on both occasions the servers were able to tailor i to our vegetarian requirement
4
A lot of hype and speculation because of its relationship to Jamie Oliver but I can only say its is just another western restaurant that taste good. Put the name aside and rate this fairly, the food is not bad, although some improvement can be done.The steak and all is above average, but I really like the fries. Surprisely, no many people can do it so well to make me love the fries
3
Wanted to try this big name Restaurant for a while. I think if anybody came with big expectations here, you will be disappointed. The restaurant is spacious and some parts have a partial sea view. The menu is different from the forum branch, I noticed. I wanted to have the mushroom pizza I had before but they don’t have it here. I had the roasted chicken & courgette pizza $24.95 and rocket salad with Parmesan & balsamic vinegar $8.95. Hated the olives on the pizza. Not my thing. I guess I could have requested then not to put it. PizZa is nothing fantastic. Not wow. I’ve had a wow pizza before in Italy. This was far from it but price is expensive. I don’t understand one thing. Why the salad is always sooo salty?? Oh my god. I can crunch on the salt bits. So salty. Argh. Why did I give it an average rating? The food isn’t bad, it’s just average. There’s no wow factor. The service is also average. So basically everything is average, except for the price which is on the rather high side for such food Taste & quality.. Would I be back? Hmm... nope, unless necessary.
4
We have been to this restaurant many times since it's opening. This time the whole family was together for a pre New Years dinner. The serving sizes are large and the food well prepared. I can really recommend the burger, the risotto and the steak but stay clear of the salads. Have ordered them a few times and get disappointed every time. The starters are nice as well but it is quite odd that you have to pay for a bread basket. The desserts are really good and I really love the brownie with ice cream. This evening it was very busy and the waiters were running around and we had to wait to get the plates cleared, water refilled, get the dessert menus etc. You can choose indoor or outdoor seating. I prefer the Vivo city restaurant over the Forum one and will definitely be back.
4
It is my 3rd time at Vivo Jamie's Italian this last quarter of 2017. Fall in love with their lamb chops scottadito and ultimate garlic bread. Their simple baked lasagne is nice too. The garlic bread cost around $12.95 each. But it is still worth a try
5
Everything was just fantastic and perfect. The Christmas course was value for money especially since it came with a bubbly! Hahaha.
4
We enjoyed sear tuna, burger and pork chop there. Wines are ok and Archipilago Draft is awesome! Service is expected and staff friendly.
5
Love the variations of food and drinks. The desserts as well. Attentive service. The Xmas menu is worth it!!
5
Awesome dining experience and wholesome gourmet, everything was perfect from starter to main course to dessert
1
My family and I (party of 6 plus one child) ordered 6 mains for sharing at dinnertime. The food came reasonably quickly. We had 4 items from the mains menu, one Margherita pizza, one salad and polenta chips. EVERY SINGLE DISH was awful. Our reservation was at 6 pm, when the restaurant was only like 1/4 full so we can't chalk it up to the chefs rushing our food. Polenta chips were tasteless, as were the chicken, tuna, fish and chips, pork chop and pizza. I am not expecting the dishes to be over seasoned; I have salads for my meals every day and love having them with little dressing. I expect, at the very least, just ONE of those six dishes to be flavourful and Jamie's Italian even failed to meet such low expectations. The seared tuna, as one standout example, looked and tasted raw. It was utterly horrible. I do not foresee Jamie's Italian Vivocity surviving past 2018.
3
Average food. Supply and demand has better pastas. If not for entertainer 1 for 1, will not dine there again.
3
Brought my wife to Jamie's Italian for dinner on her birthday. The place was cozy and nice. The staff are warm and friendly. Our waiter introduced their specials and ongoing promotion.I ordered Italian (Flash) Steak with coleslaw and fries on the side paired with a glass of red and Spaghetti Vongole with clams paired with a glass of white.We were quite disappointed with the food. The sirloin steak is so pale that it looks more like a pork. I sprinkled it with a bit of salt and pepper but still bland. The vongole also tastes like something is missing.Overall it's good service and place but not great food. And a little pricey for it's taste
3
The service is always a disappointment...But the food was good, value for money, great portion. Tried their gluten free pasta, it was really good!
3
The environment was good. But the food was average with the pizza being slightly better than the rest.
3
I went to this restaurant for the first time in a few years to give it another try. I found the food rather disappointing. The pizza was horrible and it did not come cheap. With the same price tag, there are many other better options in Singapore.The service was quite good though. The waiters were professional and friendly. My water was quickly refilled most of the time.Overall it was not a very good experience
5
I had dinner with my 2 young kids and the nice waitress was very helpful with our frequest requests. They loved the food and had a lovely time there.
4
Held a birthday Celebration for my GFF and enjoyed their amazing dishes with generous Servicing. Their truffle Tagliatelle and Porchetta are 2 amazing dishes that kept me going back for the 2nd time.
5
We have our dinner with favourite pasta and pizza. We also order hot Mocha.
The waiter is serving us well and he is very friendly!
4
We've always liked Jamie's restaurants because they are kids friendly. The noise and crowd can be a bit of a put down though. Service was good as usual but a bit slow when it got crowded.
4
Good service despite restaurant being almost full. Didn't manage to get the lady wait staff who attended to our table but she did a great job to help us feel welcomed.Ordered a Grilled Pork Loin which we found it too tough and slightly bland. Couldn't manage to finish the pork loin. Otherwise, we enjoyed the Herbed Baby Chicken on the Christmas menu and the Crispy Calamari.
1
Service was fine but food was terrible and expensive. I can't find one dish that's nice. Definitely not coming back her
1
Visited the restaurant on 19 Nov 2017. Was served by a short hair lady and her service was terrible. One of my friend wanted to change the drinking cup due to some stain, however the service staff replied rudely saying that the cup was not dirty before reluctantly giving us a new one. It also took us more than 30 mins to pay our bill.Overall bad experience and the food is surely over-priced
2
Overpriced for mediocre Italian fare. Service is passable at best. Table bread with olive oil and balsamic is not complimentary ... which is silly given how much food costs here. Ordered a small dessert as a birthday treat ... and the staff did not even provide enough spoons to go round.
1
The waitress serving us looks perpetually annoyed for whatever reasons. She raised her voice when we made enquiries, seating arrangements for a group of 7 were poorly arranged, glasses looked encrusted with salt and when we requested to change, she replied curtly that it is not dirty but that the dishwashing machine damaged it. We even waited half an hour just to make payment.Food was delivered promptly but it was at best only average. Definitely not a good first impression and not coming back
1
Let's start with the fact that I am a big Jamie Oliver's fan. Love his TV shows, have all his books signed by him. We invited friends for a big lunch at Jamie's Italina in Vivo City. Let's start with the staff:not helpful, poor service, and really not happy to see kids in the place. Not just one person but 3 or 4 staff members were just moody ( very unusual for Singapore). Now the food. Pizzas were half burnt, tasted like tomatoes sauce that you buy at super market with very poor quality cheese. Worst pizza I had in a long time. The kids barely touched their pizzas as well. The veggies they had did not look fresh. I was speechless. Of course the price was not cheap either. Please change staff and chefs!!!!! Jamie deserves millions of time better than this place!!!!
4
Pre-order our lunch menu the day before, food came out very quickly though the pasta was a little cold.
3
Came here for a quick bite to eat while shopping in the mall. It s good and nice but nothing amazing
4
Love their tomato sauce for fries!
And also the gastric inducing garlic.
Good selection with new options everytime.
5
The food was good, as usual, as expected. And as a plus, we got to watch the Crane show from across the waters, as we were having our dinner. Their special touch to the dessert serving to celebrate our anniversary was a nice touch.
4
Enjoyed the pizza and tiramisu when I was here. Not cheap though as these two items alone set me back $35.
4
Jamie’s Italian was generally a warm and pleasant family dining experience both times I tried. My second dinner experience at the Singapore Vivocity outlet paled a little in comparison to my first lunch at the Bangkok outlet. The same classic platter had different vegetables used (and the ones used in Bangkok were better). Somehow I felt like Jamie’s Italian in Singapore had a confused identity. Chinese broad leaf spinach was used in my Wild Mushroom Risotto. A vegetable similar to Kailan was used in the Classic platter. I was thinking maybe it’s to differentiate their outlets using “local” ingredients, but it really doesn’t work for me. Still, it’s a great place for kids. Service staff were really friendly in both outlets. The Singapore staff were “chatting” with my 9mth old about shopping, Sephora, and the day. They complimented her with a breadstick much to hers and our delight cos it meant the adults could enjoy their meals
3
I live near Vivo City and stopped in last week for dinner with a friend. It is well decorated and has a good atmosphere, and although we had to wait (because the place was so crowded), the staff was friendly and helpful. I was a bit put off by the prices, particularly the alcohol, but it is Singapore, so what can you expect? What I did not expect was that the pizza was dry and pretty much tasteless. This is not even the best pizza in Vivo City, let alone Singapore. I prefer Modestos up on the 3rd floor, which is pretty mediocre itself. My friend had some pasta, which was better, but still, nothing too fanstatic. A MUCH better call is Pietra Santa, which is over near Portsdown Road. At about the same price, the food is dramatically better, the atmosphere is great, and they have a great wine selection.... although it is a bit out of the way...
3
The food is great and the service is good. However, the receipt should indicate the fact that we had add-on (or top-up) to our meals
5
We celebrated our daughter's birthday with 20 of her young friends at Jamie's kids birthday bash.All the pre-party planning were very efficiently handled by Brian. He handled all our queries and his response time was fantastic. Even gavd us his hp number for better response. Very dedicated.The 2 staff that were managing the party were Mark and Swuny. Very enthusiastic fellas. Always smiling, very patient, always willing to do all thry can to make the kids feel cool, happy and fun. The girls went through a Masterchef pizza making experience ked by one of their chefs. They led them thru a hetb garden, taught them how to knead their dough, put on their favourite toppings and then eating their gourmet puzza for lunch. What a treat! They even sae how pasta was made and we created a 20m long pasta...At the end of the day, all the kids had a wow wow real life hands on experience.One of the must dos for parents planning an unique birthday experience. Beats all the usual nagic shows, party hosts, arts or crafts.
4
It was my daughter & I every month end new restaurant try out day :) We decided to try out from the mall near our place and was listed on Chomp. This restaurant was one that we passed by for many times but had never been courageous enough to walk in before. It was by the famous chef Jamie whom we often watched his cooking shows on TV. The place looked very altas, expensive looking with most of the Caucasian crowds which made us feel not very welcome but with our redeemed voucher, we decided to give it a try, be brave for once :p. I really felt never judge the restaurant by it's outlook. The charges are not that ridiculous here and I felt the kids meal was great. My girl took the mini beef burger set. It came with choice of juices or milk and add another $3.50 for a dessert which my girl wanted browie with ice-cream. I wasn't feel very well that day so just took their fruit smoothie of pear & blueberry and it was great. Our overall dining experience was great at Jamie's restaurant
4
Jamie's Italian is a chain, and good for a quick meal. Their set menu lunches and dinners, and 2-4-1 drinks promotions are good value.
4
Great atmosphere and good choice for couples with kids! Attentive service and yet gives some privacy.
4
The platters are visually pleasing and the food is good, but I it's a little overpriced for a semi-casual eatery.... Nice decor though, and the staff were really friendly and attentive.
4
The taste of food is nice and worth the extra effort to fork out for the food and atmosphere. Good for both gathering and anniversary event.
5
Went there with my family on 18 Oct. We had reservations and were shown to our seats. I tried the pasta (bolognese) and my wife had the steak. Service was above excellent and we really enjoyed ourselves. The food was good and you could tell that the chef really put in the effort to give you a superb dining experience
4
Sprawling over a few ‘000 square feet of Singapore’s biggest mall, Vivo City, and overlooking the water to Sentosa, is this family friendly casual dining restaurant with a premium dining price tag.That’s not to say it’s bad - it’s all very good - but it does pinch a bit.I’ve been a few times for lunch as my office is very close, and can recommend:- Salt & pepper squid is a good sharing starter. They do lots of planks of cheeses and cold cuts too, they look good but never tried- Superfood salad is large and a great mix of exotic grains, herbs and fruits making it a whole lot more than a bowl of lettuce. - Seared tuna is served rare on a huge portion of almost puréed avocado and sweet cherry tomatoes.- A very meaty and delicious lasagne always draws groans of food envy.- The Italian steak is served with a bucket of chips and coleslaw, my go to dish. - As you’d expect in an Italian, lots of pasta dishes, but I’ve only tried the arrabbiata, simple and tasty. Finally, if you think you’ll be going again, get the loyalty card. After Jamie does an Italian Job on your wallet, you can get an $80 voucher for your next trip. Lovely Jubbly
5
A well laid out restaurant, fast and friendly service. Was it the best Italian I’ve had? No. But it was delicious. We ordered starter portions and they were just right. The Tiramisu was disappointing. The prices were reasonable by Singapore standards and for the Jamie Oliver brand.
5
Wow, loved Jamie's Italian, they have a really good kids menu. I had spaghetti with vongole it was delicious my husband had spaghetti with prawns and enjoying it, the portion sizes were very good. My kids had spaghetti with meatballs and ate all of it, the prices I thought were quite good, considering Singapore is quite expensive to eat
4
Attentive and suggestive the food servers. Flexible with children too. Definitely a family restaurant. Jaime's kids menu is good too but just a suggestion to go easy on herbs. Not all 4 year old like herbs
5
Service was very attentive! Servers were all very polite and the food served was up to my expectations:) we ordered the evening set menu which comes with 3 course. Our starter was the crab and yogurt crostini which has a spicy kick to it:) for mains, we got the seared tuna which was cooked perfectly and seared evenly! It was heavenly. For dessert, the chocolate lava cake and butterscotch ice cream did not let us down either Overall, food is good and yummy. Will be going back again soon
4
it was a pleasant evening having dinner with my girl friend, the waitress was attentive , food served was fresh and well cook. I was given the preferred seat when I made my booking. The dinner money well spend
4
Food was good. Fresh ingredients and food was tasty. Family ambience. A little dark if seated inside away from the window. Service was nice. Staff was courteous.
4
We had a wonderful server with us that night who constantly checked on us and chatted with us. She was very detailed and we had a great meal.
4
Great kids menu. Attentive wait staff. Tasty pasta, pizza and burgers. I had the lamb burger special and enjoyed it. Pizza was a nice thin crust.

The food at this restaurant is not spectacular, but not bad either. Besides the main course arriving somewhat cold, the food is otherwise consistent with strip mall Italian restaurants. Two out of three dishes arrived at the right serving temperature while one was obviously below. This is definitely not a gourmet Italian restaurant nor on the same level as other Jamie Oliver restaurants elsewhere in the world. The service, however, is truly appalling. In a country not known for service already, this restaurant sets itself apart with not only terrible but also dishonest customer service. On a Friday night at 7:30pm, the restaurant was far from full and accepting walk in customers without any wait. In fact, it appeared that most of the diners at this location were walk in customers. We were seated at a location directly below the air conditioning vent at full blast. Most of the guests seated there were feeling cold. We asked to be reseated to one of the numerous other open tables around the restaurant, but the snobby host Brian replied “We are a restaurant with a reservation policy, and those other tables have all been booked by larger parties.” Less than 10 minutes afterwards, I noticed a walk in party of two was seated at the exact table we requested, which was supposedly booked for 4 as per Brian’s statement. There were also numerous tables open at the restaurant. I will not be returning to this location. While the food was fine, the snobby and dishonest service ruined the experience. There are many other Italian restaurants in Singapore with significantly better food and service. I would wholeheartedly recommend Valentino’s or Mozza instead. Both of these restaurants offer significantly better food and warm genuine service at a similar price point.

yesterday i had dinner with family at vivocity..food and service was good. .i like one staff explain the special. .if im not wrong the staff name is nurul.. i like also how she explain the food serve on the board i dont know what dishes, its like starter food. .very spontaneous! anyway my family happy and enjoy dinner at vivocity.
3
Food was average. But service was not too bad. It was crowded evening on a Monday evening. One try is good for now
5
My wife and myself spent our very first wedding anniversary in Jamie's at Vivocity with our new-born. The food was great and the staff were friendly and helpful! Had previously booked in advance and informed that we would be celebrating our anniversary there. The staff offered to give a little surprise by serving the desserts on plank with 'Happy Anniversary' wordings to commemorate our dining moments. It was done so well that my wife did enjoy greatly and never stopped talking about it at the end of the day!Thank you! :
4
Food and service were good but they forgot the birthday surprise I planned and briefed them on. What a shame.
5
i like the way the staff share the daily special menu. They understand their menu very well, don't hesitate to share with us suitable portion for number of diners. We already had our main dishes, we would like to add on salad to complete the meal. The staff recommended small portion which was not in menu and in fact, the size was just nice and we were completely satisfied. Well done! Will definitely visit again.
4
Dropped by for a late lunch as tourists.
The portions are big and quite tasty.
Service was also good. Efficient I would say.
5
I love the food. It always never fail to amuse me. Waiters were patient and friendly. Facilities are child friendly.
5
Visited with family to celebrate my sin's birthday.
Food is excellent, service is warm.
Recommended place for any occasion.
A special mention to Mark -Thanks for the attentive service!
4
Good environment for Birthday Celebration. Food portion is just nice for sharing and enjoyed the happy hour 1-for-1 house beer / red wine etc.
3
A decent but rather unremarkable restaurant. Classical Italian stalwarts are executed consistently across the board but with nothing exceptional. Best of the bunch probably being the homemade Tortellini. Prices are slightly higher likely owing to the brand name but a decently airy space somewhat makes up for that
3
The food was pretty decent and the greeting staff were efficient. However the waitress that served us was not pleasant at all. Never responded when I thanked her for anything. Pretty horrible for a supposedly good establishment
4
Initially wished to order the panna cotta. However waiter Vivien noticed and understood that my boyfriend and I were muslims- and Vivien took the initiate to pre-empt us that the dessert contained gelatin. Appreciate the heads up even though we did not ask. Shows that she cared about her customers and was genuine and honest of her service. Left the restaurant with a little note from her too! Good job and thank you, Vivien

I was greeted with a pleasant and well-mannered staff who guided us promptly to our table. The place has a cosy and comfortable ambience. What makes it better will be the variety of food on the menu and their food is well-balanced with the right amount of heat, crunchiness and flavour.
5
We went to Jamie's a few nights over our 10 day holiday, always went back as the food was fantastic and quite cheap. The cocktails and desserts are also equally as delicious. The staff are so friendly and again was one of the reasons we just kept going back. We tasted pretty much all the menu and it was all delicious. Something for everyone from kids to adults. Great stuff
4
we started with the bread basket which was quite nice and filling:) followed by the parma pizza and another daily special - some sort of salmon pasta. the pizza was great, while the pasta was not as good as we expected. the staff were friendly even thou they mixed up the orders sometimes, but they quickly fixed it.. overall experience was not bad, the price is slightly on a high side thou.
5
Wonderful experience. nice service and nice food, though we should have ordered mushroom instead of the other side dishes. but overall it was a good experience.
5
Great location, we went here after spending a few hours in Sentosa. The food is excellent, if you are will to shell out a little more, portion size is good. Service was attentive.
3
The carbonara, tiramisu and funky chips left the best impression amongst our orders. Baked mushrooms were too bland
3
Went with relatively high expectations as I've been watching Jamie Oliver's shows for many years. The restaurant was spacious but a little too cold. The service staff were prompt and friendly and I think it's a plus to the service experience.Wanted to try the pork chop and steak but the former was not available. Settled for the chicken instead. Both the chicken and the steak were slightly dry. Asked for sauces for the fries but unfortunately, they only had tabasco sauce and ketchup. May return again to try other items
3
I wouldn't come back again. Overpriced food which was not tasty. I booked for a table in advance and was given a corner table despite mentioning that this was for a birthday.
4
We head to Jamie's Italian every time we are at Vivo City. The service staff are a cut above those in other establishments. Love the crab arancini and the Truffle Shuffle pizza. The Classic Super Food salad is pricey, but packed full of goodness. We look forward to our next visit!
5
The food is good, with a variety of pasta, pizzas and mains, though it's a bit pricey. However, the atmosphere is good for couples and gatherings.
3
We ordered the pork chop and lamb chop. The pork chop was tender, delicious and the portion was generous but the lamb chop had the strong goat meat smell which made it difficult to eat. I would have given the dining experience four stars if not for the lamb
5
i just love how this restaurant takes on kids menu , they are delicious we even order an extra one because my boys love their spagetti meatball so much. they forgot to gave us the salad on the last kids meal but its okay only my oldest eat the salad anyway. the adult menu is a bit on the saltier side but the kids are season pefectly. the service is okay , but the kids meal are deffeniatly the star 
4
Quite a good place in Vivo city for a business lunch. Staffs were very attentive and service was rather prompt. Food was interesting, but not too much of a variety in the menu
4
The staff was flexible to bring the beer before coming back to get our orders. Neither were they seen to be pushy or being seen hovering and interrupting conversation.
The food was excellent and would definitely be back for more visits
5
Good service. Very nice staff. Definitely recommend to anyone. The staff was very proactive in recommending dishes
5
Food was fantastic and delicious.
A bit pricey but worth it.
Service was excellent and easy access to the mall.
I love my food. We will be back
5
great food and ambiance, love the service
would come back again for more food and drinks
could expend on their menu a bit ...after a while its quite boring
5
Great food with lovely ambience and the service was fast. The waiters were knowledgeable about the menu and recommendations were excellent. A lovely place for family and friends to laugh about and enjoy great food.
5
Was surprised by the overall quality. Had the ribeye which was well seasoned and exceptionally tender. Served with grilled portabello mushrooms and caramelised balsamic onions. Wife had the Venetian seafood stew which was quite good. Truffle mashed potatoes and rocket salad were great sides. Great meal overall and will definitely be back.
3
Had dinner at Jamie's, wasn't expecting much based on some pretty lackluster reviews by friends. Started with crab and avocado crostini, which was a pretty good start to the evening. Then came the ravioli, which was pretty bland tasting, and the dough was too thick. Next up we had lobster stew, which was not on the menu, but a seasonal specialty. The decent sized pot had prawns and lobster in it, perfect for two to share. Lobster was ok, but the prawns we had were not fresh, the heads were detaching from the rest of the body. The prawn meat was no longer firm.We could see the open kitchen from where we were seated, and there was a guy supervising the food coming out. He was doing his best Gordon Ramsey impression i guess, as we could hear him shouting and telling the kitchen staff off, in full view of diners.Would I dine there again? Honestly, no. Food was really mediocre at best
4
I was here with my 3 young daughters and Ronica, the waitress serving us, was very thoughtful and took the initiative to provide children's cutlery, colour pencils and straw for drinking water. In spite of her busy-ness, she was cheerful and handled our requests well. Food was great too
5
Visited the Vivo one with my wife.The quality of the food is wonderful and there is a lot of variety. Each item on the menu is worth trying and has a unique taste. The service was great and Shuang was most helpful and made us feel at home - Jamie's is lucky to have such employees
4
I was here with my girlfriend having a early birthday dinner together. I made a reservation at 6.30pm but we were at Vivocity early so we decided to go in at 5.30pm and we were promptly seated. The waitress Shuang as well as the managers (there were a couple of them) were attentive to our request and gave many recommendations for the promotion sets available, on top of the menu. I had friends who were going to send a small cake to the table not from the restaurant and I asked permission from the staff if it was ok. They not only agreed to it, but helped with the lighting on the candles as well as bringing a customised plank with the wordings "Happy Birthday" written in dark chocolate within seconds. Shuang and the other male staff (I didn't manage to get his name) were very helpful in this little surprise and it was definitely an A+ service experience for us. Food wise, it was decent. We had a Weekend Roast set and a Crispy Squid. The Crispy Squid taste good with the spices paired with it. As part of the Weekend Roast, we also had the Prawn Linguine. We liked the freshness of the prawns and cherry tomatoes, but we felt the texture of the linguine was a little off. The roast pork belly was alright, but we LOVED the red wine sauce, and basically dipped everything in it. Overall, it was a great experience and I would like to thank the staff at Jamie's Italian in VIvocity for their service
4
The food is great with sizeable potion. The only complain it is slightly pricey but understandable due to branding And location
5
Food was very good and consistent as usual. Excellent seat reserved as promised. Good experience with friends.
4
Service and food was great. A little pricey but overall experience was great. I highly recommend the bolognese as the pasta was really fresh and chewy. Penne carbonara was amazing too! Will visit again to try the meat platter
4
A good place to dine with family and it's kids-friendly to keep them busy. The variety of food changes so you will have more choices. The service is good and you will be kept informed of their specials.
4
Menu is a little pricey but valuable with entertainer. Wont come if without entertainer. Service is good i must! Food is nice :)
3
The staff were very friendly and accomadating. Even though we missed our reservation and we a large group, we were seated once tables could be arranged. The food itself was decent with the pizzas being notable. However the desserts, particularly the Panna cotta and tiramisu were excellent.  
4
Nice family diner with great service. Quality of food is not the best. The pasta was not done al dente.
2
Sitting outside we had to wait more than 10min before a waiter stopped by to bring a menu. This slow service remained unchanged troughout our dinner. Food was reasonable but not exceptional. There are better places to go to
3
Food was ok, a little pricey, but it is expected. Atmosphere was good, love the ambience. Service was great and the wait staff were attentive. Food was not up to what I've expected thought but still not bad nonetheless
2
It is the worst lamp chop that I had ever had, smelly! I would not recommend this restaurant to other
3
They forgot to key in our Mains order. We had 3 appetizers. The mushroom fritties were so good but the olives werent
4
There's a good a selection of food from Jamie's and the customer service is excellent. It is an ideal place to gather family and friends for a good meal
5
Went a few times to Jamie Italian previously and struck it off my list. Food was quite bad. But a Friend went again and said they've improved. Good thing I have it a try again. It's really improved heaps!!!! Staff has improved too. Less arrogant and more friendly. Overall, it was pleasant experience this time round
3
I havent been to Jamie's for about a year and I think the standard has dipped. They revamped the menu and it wasn't that good.The crab pasta was superb, but since the revamp, the item was removed. Ordered the prawn linguine, portion was tiny and it was too salty
3
Ok, I only visited this place once, although I've visited the ones on London a lot because of their cooking classes! I was hoping to get the same "feel" as the ones in London! But for some reason I don't get that "rustic" vibes when I visited this one! The service was rather "so so" and I wish they maintained the cleanliness of their tables and their soft Furnitures/ bench especially the one outsidoor! I still love the food though! I am a huge fan of Jamie ( both TV show, cooking products and tools) and his recipes!
5
We celebrated our Dad's 80th Birthday at the outlet at Vivocity. It was the family's first experience at Jamie's and we were blessed with the service of San. San was friendly, attentive to our needs - made appropriate recommendations on the menu. San anticipated our needs well and took initiatives that ensured us an enjoyable experience.San's recommendations for our party of 11 allowed us to experience the different items on the menu. With the exception of our pizza order, we preferred our pizza crisp, we all enjoyed our food. San is a gem! And thanks to San, it made Dad's 80th birthday celebration a success and an evening without stress. Thank you again San
4
Did a Sunday lunch at Jamie's Vivo and the food was delicious and healthy. Had the pollo pizza, spaghetti with meatballs, the Superfood salad and a kids meal fish dish. The pizza had a nice crispy crust and I love the rocket leaves on top. The meatballs were a little dry on this occasion. The Superfood salad was wholesome and fresh and yet flavourful. I always enjoy coming to Jamie's as I know what I'm getting. Service was decent and the price of food reasonable. Will return for sure..
5
I have visited Jamie's Italian few times and found that the food is consistent at every visit. The staff members are welcoming and friendly. Highly recommended if you're looking for good Italian food
4
the food and their service is nice, i like the pizza and tomato pasta. there are kid frenly and with nice dec
2
Atmosphere and service was good. The dishes are blend and below expectation. Funky fries was actually normal french fries.
1
When I sat down it took over 15 minutes to order the food and the food was chewy and bland this is not like Jamie Oliver knowing that he is famous!!! They need to improve their service and also their horrible food !!
2
First time visiting Jamie restaurant and was highly disappointing.We sat at a metallic table that was looking more like a table from a hawker center than the table of a renown chef.Service was terrible . We had to wait 15 minutes for our drinks and got it only after we asked them for a second time.Being Italian I can tell you that the dishes are far from being Italian but a (probably) English interpretation of what Italian cuisine should be . Maybe good for most but definitively not authentic and not to Italian taste. When you add to all this that the bill is very "salty" , well , I will not go back 
5
First time visiting and was impressed by the fantastic service! Polite and attentive. Really enjoyed ourselves. Food was also really great although variety is a little lacking
4
Jamie´s Italian is always a must go when I travel! Just love the style and ambience! So when I am fed up with the local food Jamie´s is the place to be. Quality food as always!! And nice location and good atmosphere!
4
Food was great, we were given a seat away from the music as requested on chope. However, the serving waitress isn't the most attentive nor the most polite.
4
If u are looking for good Italian veg options, Jamie's is the place to go! We went on a Sunday morning and the place being beside Sentosa had a nice refreshing feel to it. We tried the World's Best Olives and if you are an olive fan...its a must try! Even the simple homemade lemonade was refreshing
3
Ordered the Caesar salad and the spicy meatball pizza. Good size portions . Meatballs are very smalland scattered across the pizza . Not as thin crust as I would have liked and not crusty at all. Salad was ok. With the Entertainer appOne for one main this was ok value.
4
I would recommend that you go for set menus as alarte carte pricing is much pricier. The selection for the starters, mains and desserts are a bit limited but for the price of $24.95 (choice of 2), I can't complaint as you don't get the same quality for the same price at say a Swensens or Jack's Place equivalent. The quality of the food is good.
2
Prawn pasta wasn't al dente but was way undercooked. For a few shrimp that charges $27, I would at least expected some fresh prawns but it tasted like those iqf shrimps. Everything else was alright but standard has definitely drop. Hope they improve soo
1
Very disappointing, given it's name. Will not visit. Feels like a cheap quick-service restaurant as opposed to a gourmet's cooked with love kind of meal... Nothing spectacular about the meatballs on pizza too. It's a pity it doesn't seem to live up to it's name
1
Celebrating my daughter birthday on 29 May . We were very disappointed , staff are rude and food tastes horrible . Will never visit 
4
Food good even for vegetarians, nice atmosphere though it's harder to stay there longer on weekend nights especially if you have a gathering of friends and just wanna spend the night away there. All in all a nice experience with good service
3
We were sitted next to the counter where the food comes out and it was impossible to hear each other talk. The noise from falling plates, plates being put onto the counter and the chatter of the kitchen staff was so loud we just couldn't hold a conversation. The recommended menu of sirloin beef was not a good cut.
4
Visited Jamies italian and though of it as a quick bite to eat but plesantly surprised. Pork chop was amazing and burger was good. Would definitely visit the restaurant again.
2
I had prawn pasta, whilst my dining partner had steak. The pasta came with really tiny prawns, and taste was at best just average, not a cent worth the $28 that I am being charged for. The steak was sliced super thin, to the extent that it was pathetic. They also could not get the medium rare right. I would skip this any time
1
I love Jamie's food when I cook it myself, and I cannot understand why his restaurant at Vivo is so terrible. The taste is blend, the attention to detail lacking. It's edible, and that is just it. Staff is apolegetic, but on my PM to ask why their Chicken Club looks just like a Chicken Burger I never got a reply. Very disappointing and for that I paid good money I will never be able to spend again. The orders did not come at the same time and I never had the great service other's are writing about. Seems I was in a completely different restaurant. Not recommendable
3
Food standards have dropped since our last visit during the initial opening. Pretty disappointing.Pasta arrived slightly warmed. Burger came with bitter bits (you could say its charred). Calamari was not crispy.. Well, what u think
1
Tried carbonara which is a classic dish but even that was so poorly done. A total disappointment from Jamie Oliver
4
We arrived an elected to have the two course lunch for $24.99 (other option was three for $29.99). The Caesar salad was really nice and two had the Carbonara which they loved. My Margherita pizza was about 4 minutes late and first the waitress came to apologise and ask if it was ok if she bought the other mains out then the manager apologised and then the head chef delivered the pizza and apologised again and they bought some Italian Nachos (seriously nice) for me to have until the pizza arrived.Well worth the visit
5
Choice of food selection recommended by the Waitress was just perfect. Food was fantastic. True Italian taste.
4
Staff are pretty unsure of things. But thankfully the msnager is always around to help and resolve. Pls up keep Jamie Oliver standard
5
Just had a delicious pizza from Jamie's Italian on Orchard Road Singapore. Thin crust, flavorsome and tasty. Two glasses of Moscato and then the most tantalizing gelato. Overall rated a 10! Oh and friendly service as well
2
I love Jamie Oliver and was keen to eat in this restaurant. The decor and the service was excellent as I expected. My daughter had the Truffle Ravioli and said they were amazing. I ordered the special. Apparently one should never order the special. It was Gnocchi Sorrentino and I could have sworn they were packet gnocchi. I'm still asking myself if this could have been possible. Did they run out of gnocchi then nick down to the local supermarket to buy packet gnocchi!!?? Really disappointing. I would probably try the restaurant again because I love Jamie and the ambience of the restaurant, but no more gnocchi!!
2
We booked a table for 7, and was given a nice big round table by the side. However, the food was really average. Some of us ordered pasta but it was overcooked. The burger was really nothing special.All in all, the meal was forgettable. My first and only visit to this restaurant was a couple of years ago, and it looks like nothing has improved much
4
We made a reservation for 10 people inclusive of 2 kids and an infant. Table was good enough to place a stroller for my baby. Overall the food serving was good, but the beef was over done & tough. We had give our feedback & the manager offered to replace us with a medium raw beef steak. Service was wonderfully and will strongly recommend to dine there again.
3
The service staff seemed not to be so happy with their jobs. Expected more enthusiasm since it is celebrity chef's restaurant.
3
Good service by attentive staff, food wise there were misses more than hits, especially the roast meat platter Father's Day special-the roast pork were all mainly fats n not really edible.. we highlighted to the staff but sadly no recours
4
4th visit to Jamie's and they get better each time. Veg options still lacking (no veg main course!) but otherwise can see they are trying. Excellent service. The Veg Plank is a bit stark for the price. I guess the meat version is much better.
4
Had a cosy lunch here with my kid before catching a movie. Beef bolognase tagliatelle with red wine was tasty and salad was fresh. Will be back
4
Ordered 2 pastas. Pastas were above average but we've had better in other restaurants of similar pricing. Also, the waitress asked us to consider ordering the special of the day 3x, which was quite irritating as we had clearly decided on what we wanted to eat. We would come here again based on the fact that we can use the Entertainer but without it, we won't be back
5
Staff was friendly and helpful with orders when we had a baby around. Nice, relaxed place to chill and chat.
5
Food was delicious, service and staff was excellent as well. My waiter was patient and was knowledgeable and willing to meet my requests and needs.
4
First time eating here. Ambience of the place was very nice, with alot of photo opportunities. Came here on a Wednesday evening with a reservation to try their dinner set menu. Food portion was just nice, both of us leaving the restaurant quite full. We had the burger and pasta. The burger was surprisingly really good. But the pasta failed to deliver. It was a very normal tomato based seafood pasta that we felt was of pasta mania standard. The appetisers and deserts was very good. Will come back again, maybe
3
Ordered carbonara and lamb chop. carbonara is well done but the lamb chop is a bit disappointing. Not very fanciful. Would love to try the pizza next time
5
Great food, cater to children with allergy. Been there a few times and as always very attentive to allergy needs
4
Friendly staff with good intro to menu and specials, food took a while and was okay, satisfies the italian craving.
4
We had the best lamb chops here. Totally juicy and tasty. Kids loved the carbonara which was a pretty generous portion. The pork chop was also very good. We should be back.
4
I bought my family with 2 kids to dine. Chope voucher is not applicable if you are going for the kid meal promotion. Overall the restaurant is nice, as it is weekday and not crowded. It will be better, if the service staff is friendlier.
3
We had the spaghetti vongole which was beyond salty. The clams were not fresh either. I utterly disappointed with the pasta. Thank good the salad and truffle mashed potato made up for it. Those two were really worth the money and calories. Don't think i'll be back for more pasta but I might go back to try their pizza and other mains
1
We were very disappointed when first step in the resturant . The resturant is not crowed , waitress shows us the sit but we told her we would like to sit at the corner which was all are empty . To my surprise she told me all are reserved but when I told her I don't see any reserved sign then she unhappily try to give me a corner sit . It was my daughter birthday so we decided to give her a good treat . Disappointed the meal is not nice and worst the desert is serves like u collect yourself from buffet station . I highlight to one of the staff about my disappointed she did not say much and had a shock look like "impossible" . She still ask me what do I order ? Can't she see from my expression I am disappointed. Without any staff training to handle situation I think the resturant manager have to look into it
1
Over priced cheap ingredients cooked terribly. For a family of five I couldn't have been more disappointed.
1
I paid 17$ for a strawberry prosecco drink with a dead strawberry on top of it. Pathetic service with rude staff. Do not recommen
4
I really enjoyed my dish. Tuna with avocado and tomatoes, it was really really nice. I also got a mango drink and although it was not my Favourite I can say it was a very good drink. Service was very nice and attentive, and I Guess the waiting was because we were a big group. The appetisers were not fantastic but still nice to eat. Overall a good experience and I see myself coming back again.
4
Decided on going to Jamie's Italian after a really long day at work.We sat down with a nice cider and a well earned dry aged fillet steak.The steak was tender and very flavoursome along with the salad and side. I always enjoy going to Jamie's and have visited on my trips to Singapore.You always get consistent well cooked food so never disappointed.Again if I am back it will be a restaurant that I will be eating again
4
Manager came and tell me which items are gluten free. So I had the pork chop without any sauce. Tastes quite good still. Will go again
4
After being on the road for a week, eating lots of Asian food, Jamie's Italian was a nice break. Service was great, especially as we had a limited time in between meetings.I wouldn't say it was cheap, but apparently nothing is in Singapore.Pizzas were okay, best to share as they are large
4
Great customer service and food. Was late for my reservations but the restaurant called up and tried to hold the the table
5
It is a cozy Italian dinner overlooking the sea. They have a outside sit out also. They serve good pizza and continental dishes. They have separate kids menu also. Cocktails are also innovative. Try out the place if u like Italian food
5
Excellent service and food. The surprise desert for my daughters birthday was awesome. My Daughter enjoyed her birthday and would definitely recommend
4
Good value weekday dinner set. Love the starters such as nachos, calamari and fried mushrooms. Enjoy the tiramisu as well
4
Family friendly restaurant with great food. Small toys were prepared if reservation with kids was made early.
5
We had the week day special, Choice of 2 courses and reasonably priced. I had soup and pizza which was huge and very tasty. My granddaughter was with us and plenty of baby seats if required
5
Excellent food and service! Thank you!! The staffs know their product very well and I really enjoy my dining experience there.
4
The food there is pretty decent. The place is good for both gatherings and couples. I think beer promos should be more obvious
5
Jamies rocks us really trueThe food food is just one of the great things at Jamies The service is excellent and the view very nic
2
Nice ambience but food was mediocre at best. We ordered 2 steaks, both medium rare but one arrived medium and the other arrived media rare. The burger we ordered was also nothing to write home about. Service was also below par. We had to ask twice for water to be serrved. Overall, it was quite a disappointing experience. I had expected more from a restaurant bearing Jamie Oliver's name
3
We had fantastic service from "maran" .. a good advert as how service should be .. congrats.However the food is good but forgettable and nothing special in the end.The price you will remember ... after service etc a burger is close to 40 yes .. 40 dollars.. it may well be good but o will not be trying it .. generally way over priced for average food.Someone has to get a grip and reduce $$ or improve quality etc.. I would be very surprised if Mr Oliver happy to have his name against this ... or has recently checked in it personallyDisappointed
5
My wife and I have read about and walk past Jamie's Italian - VivoCity on several occasions. Opportunity arose to have late lunch at this restaurant on 12 May and our overall experience was a positive one.In our opinion, the decoration around the restaurant was simple and visually appealing. From where we were seated, the atmosphere including the basic furniture and views through the windows was comforting enough to enjoy our first meal at this restaurant.The food suited our taste and we thought the chefs have prepared them well in relation to the recipes. We were served the entire time by Mark, who we found to be customer service oriented and passionate with his duties. Our numerous short verbal engagements with Mark made our meal and visit a pleasant one
2
After trying Jamie's in Australia and not being overly impressed by the price of wine and serves of food (the flavours were fine) I thought I 'll try it in Singapore one more time. Maybe its better here...We had a meat platter for 2 and pizzas. Nothing on the meat platter and nothing on the pizzas (dough was thin and crispy, but the wrong and blunt knives. For goodness sakes... put something on it... very miserly). The prices at Jamie's restaurants do not lie... Not good value for money. Nothing like the 'gusto tastes' and 'honest' food Jamie produces on tv. Forget this chain... its a rip off. What a pity
1
Anyone who has followed Jamie Oliver on TV would know how he takes care to cover his steaks so they don't dry out. But I was appalled that his restaurant did not practice what he preached. I ordered a "30 day matured" steak last weekend that was served pre-cut and devoid of any juiciness. Anyone who's into steaks would know to cut off a piece of the meat only when it's about to be popped into the mouth. The steak was also too chewy for a not so premium cut that has been aged to improve its texture (S$46 for 200g or so). And the person who cooked the steak was not able to give me a good "medium well done" as requested. What I got was almost well done. Perhaps that explains the pre-cutting? Easier for the cook to gauge the doneness of the steak! I was later told that "We follow the directions of Jamie’s Italian UK in terms of menu content & recipes. We have very little scope for creativity, as obviously, all recipes come from Jamie himself." How's that for passing the buck? And the blame now rests on none other than the man himself
5
Always a pleasant restaurant to dine. Excellence service, delicious food and great ambience. Recommend big groups, couples, special occasions celebration.
If the pizza crust is slightly softer that'd be perfect. My friend and I had a hard time cutting the pizza.
3
Have heard about Jamie big name for a long time. Have pass by the restaurant a few times but did not have a chance to experience it. Finally gotten a chance to try it but I must say the overall review is an average.
4
Good food for both kids and adults! Decent meals that everyone was happy with. We will be back soon.
1
Was shocked when the meat platter for 2 arrived. It was just different types of ham! What kind of meat platter is that? Serves 2? It wasn't even enough for 1 pax! Service was terrible. I bought chope vouchers and asked the waitress if I can use them. She wasn't sure and said would get back to me but never do so! The whole experience was just terrible
2
We waited 45 mins for a simple order on a quiet day - 1 salad, 1 Plank, 1 Pizza, 1 Pasta, 2 kids meatballs! There were so may wait staff but none seemed to own our table. Eventually after asking they gave us a morsel of bread each as we waited. The food was fine but there was no reason given for the long wait.When i went to pay the bill included most of the food items doubled up and was an eye watering 372 SGD . They corrected this with no explanation or apology, they really should have known this could not be right. genuinely disappointed and won't be back. Some shiny young staff but serious training needed
3
As always the food was good. What was lacking was the service. The waitress who was looking after us could not be understood by anyone out of the 4 of us as she tried to tell us the specials. The starter plates when they arrived one was dirty which we sent back however they did not deliver another clean plate until after the starters arrived and we asked for it. The main course arrived with much fanfare but our starters had still not been cleared anyway not bad 3/5 stars is about right. 220sgd for starters and mains and a carafe of wine for 4 people.
5
Needing to eat near the Cruise Terminal, this was perfect. Interesting to compare with Jamie's Italian, Covent Gdn (London) and it didn't disappoint. Service and food both excellent. Prices not the cheapest around but so often you get what you pay for and this was worth the cost (coffee/beer and lunch for 3 adults came to Sing $112.40)
5
We visited Jamie's Italian for a family dinner on a weekday. Service staff were extremely friendly and enjoyed entertaining my 20 month toddler. There were activities and materials provided to entertain my child while waiting for his dinner and while he was being fed e.g. Colouring sheet, crayons, stickers. The portions of food were also overwhelming. We couldn't finish our pizza and pasta dishes & the staff offered to pack the remainder for us to bring home. The desserts were yummy especially the panna cotta. Overall, I thoroughly had a satisfying meal & would visit here again.
3
Food was average..One of the waitress actually toppled some of the nachos when serving it to my table..I was quite shock that this happen in such reputable restaurant. Later on another waitress toppled another dish at the table beside mine. I believed the dish they use is too small causing this to happen often. Pls do a survey among your waitress how often does they drop the food when serving them on the table.. But there's another waitress who was quite nice..she helped to prepare the surprise bday brownie..n sang bday song with another col.
4
Visited Jamie's after some shopping at Vivocity. Our second visit and no changes in the menu. Pretty straight forward Italian stuff pizzas,pastas and antipasti etc. Nice ambience and decent food. Wouldn't say I haven't eaten better Italian food in my time. Prices on the higher side and the margaritas were " lost in the ice". Would I go again "maybe" or maybe not
4
Stumbled across this restaurant, was stoked that they were able to fit us in without a reservation.
Food was delicious however felt as though the service at times was lacking.
Reasonably priced, serving sizes were good.
Would come again, especially for the Dessert 😌
4
Food was wonderful, value for money. Quite innovative for impromptu celebrations. Service was good and helpful.
4
Jamie's Italian at Vivo City is one of my regular haunts. It's a great place to have family dinners, and to hang out with friends. Tasty and always reliable!

Nice place with a real Italian Atmosphere. You can buy Jamie Oliver stuff, of course, enjoy his food. The food is really nice. I missed the healthy vegetables little bit.
1
This was our second time at Jamie's first time was great. Food this round was awful it was cold and over cooked
3
This is our third visit. The first two didn't impressed but we had a deal on entertainer app so didn't mind giving another try. We could be the odd ones out cause the place was packed :)The pizza marinara was very good, spaghetti Vongole with the tiny portion of pasta above average but could be improved with fresher clams. The prawn spaghetti disappoints with the crunchy no flavour processed prawns which I detest. The house special the day we visited was prawn aglio olio which I didn't dare order fearing another portion of processed prawns so we opted for an upsize portion of aglio olio which came with a slightly bigger portion at a ouch price tag of $28. It was delicious though .What really impressed us was our cheerful Filipino wait staff . We dined late that night and it must have been a long day for her, yet she was full of energy and positive vibes

We reserved a table on Saturday evening. On arrival we could choose to sit inside or outside. Outside was cosy although there was a slight smell from the water. We sat for about 10mins before a waiter came to ask about our drinks. One of the wines we choose was not available. The appetizers were quite good, bruscetta with crab and artisanal breads. The main course was brought soon after, the previous dishes still on the table. The fish stew was nothing special, the steak was overdone. When deserts were brought again the previous dishes were still at the table.

Here today with kiddos. This is our 3rd time. Boy ordered chicken picnic box. Apple was rotten although the chicken wrap was nice.I ordered the weekend special prawn aglio olio and it tasted bad and it was even very expensive! no taste and spaghetti was not fully cooked, still a little hard. Girl's cheese spaghetti was okSome waiter also put other table's food to ours and was served wrong at least twice....Although the manager was very nice and understanding and offered to waive boy's mealBest meal today was kids meal picnic box's chicken wrap!Disappointed with the standard though...it used to be much better
1
I come here mainly for the kids meals but I keep trying different main courses and Jamies keeps disappointing me. I had the pizza and it was disgusting, I had the lasagne it had no cheese in and was appaling, they even tried to charge me for it after I complained which I refused to do as it was uneaten, my partner went for the rissotto and it was also unedible, I've had the fish here before and it was more bone than fish.Their starters are actually very nice so I don't know how they manage to screw up the main courses. We both enjoy the starters and I steal my kids meatballs and mix in with another starter as they bizarrely don't serve this as a main course for adults Wine list is also great but the main courses are the reason you come to the restaurant.The service is always haphazard too, you're in their with your kids needing service and food and there's loads of them hurrying around not serving you and getting orders wrong on more than one occasion when they do.Overall it hasn't really improved and struggles to deliver on it's promise of starters

Email them for surprised Birthday and everything was as plan, thank you Jamie and your staff for the well accomdation and service. Staff were all very friendly
5
It is as you would expect from Jamie's. Good food. Good service. Been here several times and they've updated the menu and as always good and reliable
4
food here is quite decent with regular set offers, good for small and large groups. service here is quite friendly, but servers can be rushed at times
4
Good service, awesome food, and great ambience. Brought my gf there for her bday meal and she love it to bits! Slightly on the expensive side though.
4
very cosy restaurant. The food was wholesome and it had that rustic home cooked feel. Presentation was also very good. The service staff were attentive and very friendly.

We were having a day out sightseeing and shopping when my husband, who is Italian, suggested we stop here for lunch. We had great views over the harbour to Sentosa and the food was great. We had fish bites as an appetizer, steak, chips and slaw as a main and berry pavlova for lunch. This set menu was $29.95. Sam had a lemon, lime and bitters, which is usually soft drink prices and was charged$10 for. I had a lychee and mint slushee which was nice for $8.50. There were also some hidden prices and the bill ended up being more than we anticipated, but we did enjoy the food and location
3
My expectations were high. Our family had lunch there. We had chicken pizza and smoothies, for child we ordered chicken lollipops and ice cream. Pizza wasn’t good, there was only bitter tomato sauce taste and few chicken pieces on the pizza. Banana-peanut smoothie was horrible, it tasted watery and peanut pieces got stuck in straw. Blueberry smoothie tasted also watery. But childrens menu was very good. Child liked the food – natural tastes and well presented.
5
My husband and i came here for dinner and were thoroughly impressed. The wait time for a table was only about 10 mins entree came out in about 10 minutes and main and dessert soon after. We both ordered pasta dishes which were full of flavour and the chocolate lava cake was to die for. I would highly recommend this restaurant, the decor was trendy and our waiter very attentive and friendly.
2
This was first time visit to a Jamie's Italian and I had high expectations. I love his TV programs and own several of his cookbooks so was hoping we would find the same savory but simple dishes as are his signature. If fact the food was boring and off. Started with House Salad, which totally lacked flavor or zest, and the Caesar was equally bland. Then had the Bolognese which was way too sweet, and the Ravioli whose filling lacked any aroma whatsoever. Our son had the meatball pizza, which had plentiful mini meatballs but was overloaded with slices of garlic. Even the dessert was bad - the 'Brownie' was more of a soft lava cake than a thick fudgy brownie. Ok food was let-down but the ambience was nice, only to be overshadowed by the poor service. Upon entering, the Hostess shared 'we close at 9', not 'our last order is at 9pm, does that work for you?' Our server was nice but did nothing to highlight menu options, and we had to repeatedly ask for beverages. One wine on the menu was not available. And we had a dessert coupon found in local visitors map, which server was not aware of.I expected homestyle authentic fare in a welcoming setting and Jamie's delivered none of that
3
The pasta that we ordered were a disappointment. The temperature of the food isnt great, it was only slightly warm. However, the service received was good
3
Food was generally good, pastas are always good there. Aircon was too cold and made the food cold quickly. Service was OK.
3
very kid friendly place. they had crayons and coloring sheets for the children. food was average. we had the pizza which was not bad, pasta was also ok... noone topped up my water the whole time though...
4
We had the ravioli and chicken main on a weekday evening. Food was very tasty and service was prompt. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice with good lighting and decor. Highly recommended.
4
I was quite pleased with the attentive service of the wait staff at Jamie's, especially as they showed extra care about food options for my friend who is pregnant. We ordered a dinner set (three courses) and added a pasta to share. The Crab and Avocado Bruschetta was super yummy, and the Classic Super Food Salad was very well balanced and tasty. We weren't very excited about the tagliatelle, but the Molten Chocolate Praline Pudding was the perfect way to end the meal
3
We eat in Jamie Restaurant with a Spanich friend. The location is good with table outdoor where it is possible also to smoke. Food is good but i advise to choose first course (e.g. risotto) and not pizza (i really didn't like too much but I am Italian). Service is ok, price average.

Dinner at Jamie's Kitchen @ #Vivocity. Finally tried after such a long time. Prep ourselves from all the not-no-nice online reviews we'd read from food quality to waiting service. Thankfully it wasn't half as bad as it seemed in the reviews. We reached around 4.40 pm despite our reservation at 5 pm but they sat us down nonetheless. The staff we interacted with were all polite. Not beaming smiles all the way but courteous and professional which was all we needed. We didn't get the "curt and rude waiters" kinda treatment as highlighted in some reviews we'd read. Either we were really lucky that we got nice and cool people serving us or as J commented "maybe those rude folks are not in this shift" or Jamie's has really up their game and polished up their team. Or they sure got some serious haters out there... We ordered "steak and frites" and their signature burger. Asked for medium but the steak came almost well done but given how thin that slab of meat is, getting it medium i.e. nice and brown outside with a moist & pink within is quite challenging because there isn't really a "within" to start with. Despite that, the steak was still palatable and soft, not stellar but what J described as "quite decent" so we didn't send it back into the kitchen. The shoestring fries were nice and crisp when they were served but the slaw wasn't as enjoyable. Wrong ratio of vege ingredients. We were kinda mixed about the burger. I found the patty on the dry side and underseasoned but J was ok with it. The caramelised onions made the base half of the sandwich thoroughly drenched or what some folks would call "soggy bottoms", so what we'd gotten ain't one of those burgers you can prop up proudly between your fingers for a hearty bite into. For the price, we were kinda expecting something more artisanal but what we got was more run-in-the-mill nameless-american-deli fare. The fries turned out more impressionable than the burger itself. Despite the rather pricey tags each of the mains had on them, the whole meal turned out affordable because we had a 1-for-1 main promo. Would we come back to pay full price for the dishes again... eh... not for the steak and burger for sure

This is the 2nd time we choose Jamie to celebrate my girl's birthday, last year is 3 yrs old and this year becomes her 4th birthday. We really love the food and atmosphere. But during this time meal, its hard to ask help from the waiters. Even when raise up hands, need to wait and wait for refill the water and order food. And there is one odd thing is, when get the booking confirmation call from Jamie, it mention that since this is for my girl's celebration for birthday, so we can order one dessert for free. But after we order one dessert, it still be charged. I dont think we will go there for a while.

I had dinner at jamie's Italian and was pleasntly surprised. The portions were just nice for my companion and I. Plus they offer small or large options to cater to your appetite, which is great!I really enjoyed the lasagne as if was tasty and not too heavy on the cheese. Also enjoyed the tiramisu very much as it was different from the others I had tasted :
1
The signature tagliatelle bolognese had pasta that was bunched together with parts over cooked and some parts under cooked, the mince cluttered together tastelessly. The kids burgers were dry and mushroom fritti was a meagre portion. The saving grace was the good service by a particularly friendly and attentive waiter
1
Was here with family to celebrate daughters 4th birthdayThe service staff was outrageously unprofessional and rudeThey demonstratively ignored our table. E.g. when our water glasses needed refill they were passing by with water pitchers and refilling the nearby tables without even approaching us. They staff even went and re-check the next table water glass (which was full at that time) to ensure the guy sitting there has enough waterAnyway, that wasn't the biggest issue.I put in my Chope reservation a note that we're celebrating daughter's birthdayWhen placing the order I asked the waiter (3021 JINGREN?) if it's possible to arrange 4 candles on a small cake. He confirmed there shall be no problem, they always bring the cake with candles and sing a "Happy Birthday" for the birthday girlMinutes later they did that for someone at next table - 3 waiters brought in the cake and sang Happy Birthday". My daughter asked:Daddy will they sing Happy Birthday for me also?I said "Yes of course"However what happened next was really unexplainableThe waiter brought in the cake with unlit candles, put it on our table and started clumsily lighting them with his pocket lighter. Obviously no Happy Birthday song whatsoever. Daughter asked me:Daddy, why they didn't sing for me like the other tableI said: never-mind we sang for you instead. That's even betterAfter settling the bill I noted to the waiter their unacceptable attitude. He replied:I'm sorry, other staff were very busy and couldn't find timeThe most idiotic excuse I ever heardThe restaurant was half empty and 3-4 waiters were standing 10 ft away from us and chatting pretty much all the time we were thereClearly good concept for the restaurant, trashed by idiotic local management and lazy staff. "Proud Dad and Chef" Jaimie Oliver shall be ashamed of his restaurantWish his children don't have similar experienc

Excellent service,food and music.
Great view of the harbour
You must try their Italian steak. Delicious food
5
Food slightly pricey. Food quality was fine, not any special. Cosy environment. Approx spending $55/person
5
Great for kids, good food and great service by the service staffs. Kids eat free from the kids' menu this week.
5
My family of 10 came to Jamie Oliver's Vivocity Restaurant to celebrate a birthday and we had a blast. Service was great and food was good and reasonably priced. Would definitely dine again sometime soon!
4
We ordered the pizza, lasagne and crab spaghetti. The food was great but service was slightly slow because of the Friday dinner crowd.
1
Had lunch with a friend at Jamies Vivo today and the Headbanging Discomusic was loud and disturbing. Several times we tried to get them to turn down the volume or at least change to some background music... in the end they turned it of, but not before they gave us a long explanation that this was some of Jamies concept- is it really your wish to let people eat and try to have a conversation in an environment that more likely could be a night club? Its more a nightmare if you ask me. Turn down the volume and turn up the service. This was my last visit here!!!
5
We visited Jamie's with the kids last week and it was one of the best dining experience. The Kids got to dine free with a main meal and they had free flow of juices, stickers, badges and colouring items to keep them occupied. Staff was great- constantly checking on us to see if everything was ok. It was happy hour- 1 for 1 and therefore we enjoyed the wines. What was great about the meal is that you can actually taste the ingredients that go into making it. It is rich and brings out the character of the dishes. Décor is quaint yet refreshing. But do make reservations if you plan to go after 7pm, coz its gets really crowded after that
2
Too pricey for that food quality. Not worth it. There are better Italian restaurants for that cost. Won't be going back again.
5
We changed the venue from Vivo City to the one at The Forum (Orchard Rd). That process was quite well done by the person who called me to confirm the appointment.Over at The Forum, we were attended to by John throughout the dining experience. Our table was a bit small for the varieties we ordered. He paced the orders well and ensured our table was not cluttered. John was very attentive and made our experience even better. Food was good, better than we expected
3
We ordered a few pasta and spaghetti dishes for adults and kids but the taste was blank, very disappointed. Especially, meatball spaghetti for kids. The meatballs were so hard to chew. How can 2-4 years old kids can eat and disgest can that, must be overcooked!
2
First time visit at Jamie's Italian.Had a good experience. Food was yummy amd service was good. Met my expectations.
5
Had a gathering at Jamie's. The food was recommended by the staff and it is very delicious!
Love their dessert specially the panacotta, which no one should miss it.
The staff is superb attentive.
Will definitely visiting Jamie's again :)
3
went for lunch and not too crowded on weekday, the ambiance is cozy but the pasta is just so so. anyway staff are nice
4
We went there for weekday dinner. We were assigned to a round table, which is good for chit-chat. Menu is extensive, and dinner set meal is value for money. You will get appetisers, main course and dessert for 39.90. I tried fried mushroom, steak, lamb and tiramisu. Lamb is nice ( but not in the set meal), tiramisu is very good with a lot of alcohol and the fried mushrooms is tasty. Steak is okay.Food was served in around 20 min. Other than this, I would say service is prompt and friendly. Overall good place for small group gathering ( 8 is still very comfortable) and couple dining. Price is reasonable for the set meal. Food quality is above my expectation.
4
Everything at the restaurant was great. Service was very good, certainly didn't expect any more. The menu is good, with good choices for children as well. We ordered the special on the board, lamb rack with vegetables and it truly melted in our mouth. Vegetables were delicious also. Our three year old ordered spaghetti meatball and received an apple juice as well which she enjoyed both. We then ordered the chocolate brownie, yummy!!Was probably a little on the high price, but you get what you pay for, and it was delicious
3
It's a nice place for gathering. The food was good, not really fantastic but nothing to complaint on the food. It's not easy to find places for big group and this place can cater big group gathering. And there's no corkage charges.Nice and cozy place to be with friends and family
2
We were the only ones in the restaurant but we had to wait quite a while for food to be served. Waitress spoke so fast, we could hardly understand her. The aglio olio was soaked in oil. Prawn linguine was too acidic and prawns were not very fresh.
2
I love Jamie Oliver's tv shows, tried cooking using his recipes and loved it. However, Jamie's Italian was pretty much a let down. Firstly, it took almost 20 minutes for the main courses to be served (the restaurant wasn't even half full on a Saturday during dinner). The service staff was pretty prompt but food took a while.The food was just so-so, nothing fantastic to rave about (you would expect some wow factor in Jamie's restaurant, wouldn't you?). We had the chicken al mattone, Italian burger, spaghetti vongole and spaghetti carbonara. The chicken was the best dish out of the rest, the chicken was tender and the mushroom sauce tasted like cream of mushroom soup. The spaghetti vongole was pretty tasteless. The spaghetti carbonara was well creamy, but no fragrance. The Italian burger served with funky fries were ok, but pretty much what you could get at a local cafe. I have to say though, that the restaurant interior is very tastefully done and looks like a fusion of Italian with dashes of Asian touches, but food quality is more important.
3
With one half of this couple being British and having eaten in the original Jamie's, this effort seemed a little half-hearted. Staff, while perfectly polite, were not hugely attentive. The food lacked flavour (tomato rigatoni) and the pasta was undercooked, while the sauce was lukewarm. The basics weren't quite right. No black pepper served with the pasta and the server poured a small amount of oil and vinegar for the bread basket and didn't leave on the table. No one came with the black pepper mill or fresh parmesan as we were both eating pasta. The carbonara was normal and did not have anything special to it as it had a hefty price tag. Jamie's name is on it, but that's about it. Franchised, yes. Fabulous, far from it.
2
The Shrimp Linguine has a fishy taste and nothing wow's me in that meal! Fiancé had a burger and I had a quarter bite, again nothing wows me! The price wow's me after ....
3
Decent place with decent food, prices are reasopnable amd worth it. the location is central and the place is comfortable for families
4
It was a pleasant experience dining at Jamie's Italian. Food wise was ok (nothing particularly special to shout about - had prawns linguine & margarita pizza). But service and ambience are good.
5
The restaurant is as sweet as Jamie. We love you Jamie . The ambience was perfect. The lady who is was really very helpful.❤️
5
the food is delicious and enviroment is cozy, definately will visit again, there are kids frenly also!
4
Yummy food, cooked with the freshest ingredients. Good choice and excellent service. Good ambiance, near the broad walk. Get a table with views
5
Went there 4 times in 10 nights. The food is fabulous and reasonably priced. Drinks, as in all of Singapore, are very expensive. The desserts were to die for (and probably will kill you with a heart attack!!)
4
To experience a different atmosphere with my little baby girl. She is happy & we also enjoy the food.
4
Their pasta comes in starter and main course size. I had their prawn linguine in starter size and felt that the portion is not enough for me. Sauce is excellent and prawns are fresh just that the linguine is a bit stiff. Service is fine and love the atmosphere.
4
We stepped into a rustic laid-back atmosphere for families and friends, which created a suitable ambience for the enjoyment of the Italian cuisine. The menu was extensive featuring italian classics and good selection of antipasti. We opted for an artisan pizza "Genarro's which had a white base, sausage, onions and rosemary. The smell and flavor combination was nice, especially because of the herb, however the second slice felt a bit boring. The avocado and carrot salad was fresh, crisp with an interesting zest, but the 1 month maturated beef was too charcoal burnt and chewy. The service was fine and fast. Overall, it felt that the restaurant is trying to imitate Jamie Oliver, because the dishes did not deliver what I believe he had created.
1
I never got in the door. The front of house was very rude, and the rest of the service staff was clueless. I walked out after being very rudely and unacceptably treated. I've been here before, and didn't mind coming back because the food was acceptable. That's why I can honestly give it an Average rating. But honestly, there are better outlets along the stretch. For the price, it would have been quite the waste of money. Glad that I found better food and had a much better dinner! The ultimate turn off at the end of the day was the service. If you can't get your customers through the door, don't expect them to give you a good rating of the food!
3
I get information if this restaurant is the best Italian restaurant in Singapore, so I tried it. nice place, with beautiful lighting. okay food menu. the price is quite expensive but worth it with the services provided.
5
It's a memorable Valentine's Day dinner, with delicious food and excellent service. The dinner service team was professional, attentive and anticipative of our needs. Really made the whole dining experience lovely! Kudos to the ably led team.
5
Brought my wife there for her birthday dinner. Food was exquisite and good. Service by waiter Manimaran made the dinner more enjoyable ! Will go there again for sure.... may be my wife will bring me there for my birthday.....?
3
Funky family restaurant with a small menu of simple dishes. The portion sizes vary, and some dishes are on the small side. They seem short staffed for the number of diners.
5
Excellent food and customer service. Booking via Chope was easy. My requests were generously granted. Will definitely come back.
4
Love my Lamb Chops Scottadito very much! Jamie's Friendly Staff "Jasmie" recommend special drink "CNY Mojito" which was good. Overall, friendly staff, efficient and great ambiance.
5
I have now been to Jamie's Italian twice, and on both occasions my husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The pasta, risotto, pizza and steak we have ordered have been wonderful, flavoursome meals and the service has been great. From my experiences, I have found the servings to be huge and the prices quite reasonable. I'll definitely return to Jamie's on my next trip to Singapore!
5
We brought my daughter and her friends here for a birthday lunch before heading up to Build a Bear. The reservation and follow up by the staff was wonderful! The kids had plenty of options to choose from on the kid's menu and my husband and I shared a pizza. Everyone there made sure the party was well taken care of. They even made a Happy Birthday display in chocolate for the birthday cakes we brought in. Great place for a party
3
We have been at Jamie's in Vivo city six or seven times. The first time was really good and the food was very tasty. Last two times the quality of the food dropped dramatically, at the same time the prices have increased. It is really sad because we used to like the place. However I don't think we will be coming back
3
Service was prompt and fast. However the food (we ordered pasta) was a bit too salty for our liking
3
Food was ok. Ordered the CNY special. Food cooked in a wholesome and healthy manner but lack of taste.
4
Decent food
But had higher expectations from the Risotto & Ravioli.
Atleast the place is nice.
Shouldn't go thinking it to be jamie's restaurant. Food Standard is pretty Average.
3
We had the burger and the steak & fries. Both were good. I wished there were more pasta options. Pricey though.
3
Went there with the wife and kids to grab a quick bite. Decent pizzas but the music blasted way too loud through the system was just awful and felt out of place to the whole setting.
4
We are greeted by Jamie's Friendly Staff and was able to recommend us some great food. overall experience was good. Just that the baked mushroom was not what we expected, it is not bad but abit too rich for us. We order a pasta and pizza good but the price is on the higher en
5
Judging by the full house daily, Singaporeans and visitors are crazy about Italian cuisine in a version of the British chef Jamie Oliver. Classic dishes such as tagliatelle bolognese or eggplant parmesan served large portions and reasonably priced. The mood lifts and bright interior in retro style with red leather sofas
3
Food wasn't too bad but nothing fantastic either and considering we were paying over $40 a head for steak, i wouldn't say it is the most value for money place in town. I could easily top up another $10-20 and get way better quality steak. The only good thing was that the restaurant put us in a nice private room as we had a big group of people.
2
Grilled pork, and pasta not taste good, so disappointed. Price too expensive ,service not good too. wouldn't go back again.
3
Recently had a couple of business meals here due location close to my office. The customer service was good. The food is average for a chain restaurant. Ok but not amazing. The menu is pretty simple and not a ton of choices. I would say it is ok for a business lunch.
2
Only carbonara was great.The tiramisu and meatball pizza is far worse than our expectations :(The waitress was annoyed when I told her that we wanted to split bill
5
Enjoyed very good food and service at this restaurant during our stay in sg. Thank you guys. See u next time we come back for sure
5
I have dinner with 4 of my friends. Food quality and taste is superb, service is very good. Burger still one of the good choice while fish stew is a new great menu!
4
Allthoug not so impressed with the seasoning on the pasta dishes I must admit that the squids with aoili is my favorites. If just the chef could frye it a little bit better. Me and my family just love to come back!
5
Staff were very friendly and helpful, food beautiful and served promptly, staff very attentive for serving extras with no long waits
3
My fiancee and I ordered carbonara, meatball pizza and tiramisu.Carbonara was tasty, 7/10 in accordance to the ones I had in Italy.We did not finish the pizza because the meatballs are dry. The crust is great though.Tiramisu was deceptively appealing but the tiramisu layer is thin. Overall, only 1/3 dish exceeds our expectations
3
I used to like to visit Jamie's Italian a year ago, wonderful food, pasta and drinks. After giving birth, the nostalgic feelings reminded me to go back there again. As like any other Jamie's restaurant in the world, the server will introduce themselves etc and will mention the special. Seems like my last visit, something wasnt right when there is no mention of special. I searched for the usual board on the wall and all it said was Happy New Year. I had Fried Squids many times so I decided to order something new Avocado and Crab Brushetta. It taste nice but not special, a bit rustic, pass on to Fried Squids as I cant let go of the wonderful taste I had year ago. What a true disappointment, I notice a lack of fried garlic flakes, and it was not crispy anymore. It was a bit soggy, with no offer of tentacles being the best part of the squids. Not a memorable dish anymore. The risotto was okay, being a fan of Jamie Youtube, I can cook better. The drinks, sour cherry fizz is wonderful but the recommended Mojito is definitely watery. Paid about 110 sgd for that and I can say never again. Will try others
2
Tried this for lunch with a colleague and it was, as the title suggests, uninspiring. I had the ravioli and my colleague the Bolognese. The ravioli were pretty dry and neither dish was especially warm.We were there for a work chat with the food secondary which was just as well as it really was below average fare.If an Italian restaurant can't serve decent pasta...................Service was OK
5
The establishment had nice ambience coupled with attentive staff. Food was excellent as well. Appreciate the service staff's efforts to help celebrate my wife's birthday. We will definately visit again in the future. Kudos and well done to the service staff
1
One of the worst meals I had so far in Singapore so far. Lamb was raw, chicken was rubbery (I guess it wasn't fresh). To top it all this meal ruined my new year dinner with my wife. Price well of course international standard. I would rather have chicken rice at nearby Kopitiam. Tastes better
4
We enjoyed the view, food and service at Jamie's, great overall!We had the meat appetiser platter, carbonara, burger and gelato which was all great. Meat platter had 5 good cuts of cured meat and cheese to accompany, carbonara was al dente and there was more than enough sauce to go around. The brioche from the burger was delicious but the meat was slightly disappointing as it was dry. We topped the meal off with their gelato which was a great way to end. We'll definitely be back!
4
Delish dishes especially the wild mushroom & winter greens risotto, great service & ambiance! Just a tad expensive :)
4
Came during the Christmas period and had the festive menu. Food was relatively good, and the portions were extremely generous. We were served by Firdaus, who was excellent.
3
We had dinner at Jamie's Italian using entertainer one for one deal. The pasta was okay but the lasagne was a bit too starchy. Couldn't finish it
5
Nice food good service good location located at HarbourFront mrt, will visit again and recommend to friends
3
Was here for a quick meal. tired a pizza and a pasta. ingredients taste fresh but food taste was kind of average. would be back if there is a good deal.
4
Always loved the pasta at Jamies' which is cooked the way I like. Tried the half serving calamari and regretted not getting the full size.
5
Very good service despite being super busy for Christmas lunch. The set menu had lots of good choices, but I would say I made the mistake of ordering something not distinctly Italian. Will probably go for the pasta in future.
2
Ordered the prawn linguine and it only tastes average. Service was below average, or bad. Slow service and bad attitude from some of their waitress, albeit the waiter was nice
3
Obviously the festive menu food are not fresh. How can all steaks served without asking temperature? Server said oni pan fried.. Dia
3
Visited with friends in a large group and most of us are first timer, the menu was creative but we found hard to make orders. Having pictures on the menu would be better, so we can estimate the portions.Food were good but overall experiences to dine can't describe as enjoyably
4
The foods were good as expected, services friendly and efficient. The restaurant is good for kids too.
4
The restaurant has a very nice decor and mostly importantly the food was very tasty n beyond my expectation.
3
Nice restaurant. Fast service. Very good ingredients. Only minor negative comment goes to pricing. They have somewhat high prices. But taste is nice, I have to say. Try lasagna even it takes 15min to prepare it. It is good and fresh.
4
Overall it is a nice place to dine. Food is great and service is good. It will be perfect if it is not so pricey. Then again it is still affordable but not everyday dining.
4
Food is really good especially the pasta and seating at their outdoor with amazing view! Had the plank for 1- cold cut are really good!!

I'd recommend romantic dates or celebrating your partner's birthday here. The lighting here is dim and warm.Food wise, the pasta comes with 2 sizes. Not sure is small & regular or regular & large. The size i ordered for the highest price seems like regular to me. The pasta was cooked to al dente and flavourful. Service staff was very friendly and attentive. Value wise is kind of overpriced. Easily hit $100 for 2 pax

Service by Ronica - very good & helpful. Food - average & it's the kitchen that doesn't do Italian food well besides the pizza. Prawn linguine wasn't that interesting. Steak was chewy till my jaw hurts, nachos tasteless, crispy squid batter not crispy. Pizzas were ok. Brownie was good. Lime tart was so minute. Restaurant very nicely decorated. I find that as couples, you are seated too close to another couple by mayb 2 inches apart (table width).

Went there for their christmas menu. Had their Truffle soup, Pasta, Steak, Brownie and Lemon Tart. Their soup is fantastic however their steak was disappointing. I ordered their steak to be medium rare but it came out to be medium to medium well. Rest of the dishes was alright and their Lemon Tart was fantastic. The restaurant was pretty noisy but tolerable and you can see that they are understaffed, took a while before I can get my bill ready

Having been to Jamie's several times and sticking to safer options like pasta, I decided to try the Venetian fish stew, but sans white wine in the sauce as I'm allergic to alcohol (I was pleasantly surprised that they were willing to prepare my dish with that specification). I'm glad I made this choice! It was a flavourful dish with fresh fish, squid, mussels and clams. Highly recommended

I visited Jamie's last night. Since the restaurant bares the name of a celebrity Chef Jamie Olivier I had high expectations and was looking forward to something special. The menu was unbelievably basic and unimaginative. So I thought to myself, the food must be incredible then... Sadly, no - it was mediocre at best. With hindsight and I should have readjusted my expectations after reading the menu. My friend and I had a small pizza each and a soft drink - cost $89! The service is decent but no perfect with far too many "upsell" approaches. Not recommended and won't be going back

Yum, yum, yum. The best meal by far we had in Singpore. Big servings, great staff and the food is fabulous. Highly recommended.

Got the cable car over to vivo city from main sentosa.. food was brilliant. Loads of choice and also good menu for young children. Massively recommend and not too pricey compared to the rest of singapore

Started with a wine...it was happy hour so it was all working really well...my Wife and I meeting after shopping...I like the bar area despite being in a mall....you must face inwards though and forget the throngs behind you...I should've seen the signs when I ordered 'the world's best olives' which came on ice all ten of them for about $9, call it $10 with tax and service and a couple of crisp things stuck in a small pot of dip..rip off. They were cold and tasteless straight from a jar..Anyway, what the heck, the wine was ok, it was happy hour and the staff were great and I couldn't be bothered carrying my bags around and my Wife turned up and it was Friday evening ffs!We got a table by the window. Our waitress was great...the aircon was full blast and made the table really cold...I asked if they had a blanket (expecting 'no' of course, I was being sarcastic - I mean who has blankets in a restaurant?) and they sure did and I had a choice of colours..genius I noticed most people eating pizza, I should've gone with my instinct but I went rogue and had we shared squid (which was good, not amazing, but ok) and I ordered the truffle soup and my Wife ordered ....My Wife was eating the Xmas set at $65 and me the Burger. Her main was Cod on lentils and a dessert, but we never got to that. She did get a glass of Champagne thrown in with the set so not all badAnyway, my soup came but her starter didn't so I had to start eating it before the aircon froze it...it was good, not too much but enough...still no sign of the starter which came 20 minutes later despite asking 3 timesMains came and you guessed it my burger was warm on the top, where it had been under the heat lamp, but cold underneath and my god it looked good....my wife's cod was delicious but the bed of lentils it was sat on was so salty, you needed a pint of water for each mouthful...Needless to say we sent them back and gave up and asked for the bill...The manager didn't charge us for the food just the drinks....The excuse was, it's a Friday night blah blah blah.....So don't go on a Friday is the message?Guys, sort your kitchen out you're embarrassing the waiting staf

I ordered seafood pasta which was recommended by one of their staff - and I definitely love it. The food was served quite fast and their crew are always ready to help you with everything. This is one of the restos that I would usually visit whenever I travel to Singapore
2
The food was mediocre.. pizza was good but the pasta wasn't up to expectation. Perhaps we simply had too high expectations for Jamie. Our group of 6 all feels the same. Service was wonderful thou. But definitely will not be back again because the food didn't impress.
5
Good food but long queue! It's best to book ahead but in case you are stuck in the queue, you will be served free appetizers while you are standing and waiting - a great marketing strategy!The food is good and the service is friendly

We have been wanting to visit Jamie Italian for sometime now and finally we made our first visit with our daughter few days ago. The booking was very swift. When I called up the restaurant I was prompted by the automated reply that I need to reserve for a table online via a link sent by the SMS. The booking interface by "Chope" was simple and hassle free. The restaurant called up on the day to confirm my booking which was a good point. What come as a bigger surprise is I can purchase a Chope voucher to enjoy 10% discount on the meal. All I need to do is to show the voucher on my mobile phone to offset any final payment. The restaurant boost a sophisticated and rustic design with huge chandelier and dark ceiling, spacious dining room with tables far apart from other diners, which ambience one can easily enjoy. We have ordered the main (burger, chicken and fish), all are above our expectation: fresh ingredients, flavourful sauce, marry so well with each other as it is packed with flavour, a standard which can only be achieved with much attention to details. For us (Asian) the main is enough to keep us satisfied as the portion size is pretty good. The service staff are very prompt and polite. Overall a memorable meal and we will have to go back for more.
4
The menu is not intensive but what I really liked about this place was that, you can actually taste the heartiness infused into the food - leaving you feeling very satisfied even though the portions are not big. It comes at a price tag though but I would definitely re-visit this place
3
Our first visit. Food is fresh and decent but no wow factor. The fries that came with the main dish actually tasted like fries from one of the fast food outlet.
4
My 1st try at this branch previously was not good, but this time the dishes taste much better than last time. The staff said chilli pizza is very spicy as it has different kinds of chilli. However, it turned out to be not spicy. The staff said the kitchen was out of jalapeno that's why
4
Food is good and service is top ! They provide shawls to us when we complained that we are feeling cold in the restaurant.
4
Ordered a main and two sides. The sides were good especially the crab dish. Meat fresh and plentiful. The main was a chicken. Sauce was great but chicken was too hard.
5
Excellent service from the staff. Gave good recommendation on what food to order.
Nice ambience too. Thank you!
5
Service staff was good and a very kids friendly place. You can also taste the freshness of the ingredient used
2
5 of us... 3 kids 2 adults.... always thought it was over priced but today was not really nice.... 3 of us had Italian Steak... Tasteless, chewy and full of fat and cartelidge... coleslaw absolutely tasteless... fries was the only thing tasty about it... My wife and daughter left the steak for wat it is... and given the location no point of complaining as you get a smile and that's it...

Our 1st visit cum celebration among canoeing friends of 4 persons. Found it refreshing and interesting which we were also given a table next to the sea with a pleasant view. The menu items were many and varied. Specially mentioned and applauded staff Mr. Ren who served us well. He's friendly, accommodating and served with passion and smiles. He's certainly an asset to the Organisation. The restaurant is located in the biggest shopping mall in Singapore which you name it (foods and shopping), you can have it . An enjoyable dinner at Jamie's Italian Restaurant in terms of ambience, foods and service
1
This is our fifth visit to Jamie's Italian Singapore in 2016 and third visit to Vivo City outlet. It was perfect for our first four visit but not for yesterday.The service was good as usual but overall of the dining experience was truly bad and considered the worst among our visits at Jamie's restaurant.The medium-rare sirloin steak was freaking chewy, the pasta was salty and the "meatball" pizza become the "minced meat" pizza which is totally unacceptable. Furthermore, we understand that the price increased due to the inflation. However, the portion become smaller and worse quality. As a fans of Chef Oliver, we have a high expectation on his every single restaurant. Every restaurant suppose to keep the high standard of food quality. In conclusion, we are very disappointed with this visit. Our next visit has been postponed indefinitely.

All the meats served at the restaurant are indeed pasteurised .Food was lovely , pizzas were fantastic. Awesome food and service was great. Thanks guys
4
Had a team dinner there. The ambiance is nice and some unconventional serving plates (my burger was severed on a chopping board). As it was a large group there were variety of things ordered.... So just loved what they ordered and some were not too pleased... I loved the burger but my friends who ordered the steak were not happy... The staff was really nice and took good care of the guest
1
The service at Jamie's is terrible. Staff were rude and unhelpful. They even brought the wrong bill to us. Imagine if we didn't check the receipt! The food is also just average. The spaghetti was hard... Which is disappointing! Definitely not worth paying the price and the service charge. Totally not recommending this place.
3
Nice décor but find the restaurant rather noisy. This could be due to the 'hollowness' of the restaurant thus the sound by diners seem to be amplified.
5
We visit Singapore regularly and we have to stop ourselves from eating at this restaurant every night! The food is absolutely FANTASTIC whether you want pasta, healthy salads or a steak its really top class. Service is excellent.
3
Better seats should be given to prior reservation. We were given a table next to the exit door facing the exterior which was warm coz hot air from the outside rushed in each time somebody opened the door. Chicken too salty.
4
It was our first visit and we liked the place a lot. Nice ambience, and very reasonable set lunch price.
2
We had our table outside the restaurant, the nicer word is al fresco. The truth was that we were left outside and forgotten. We had the impression the restaurant was full up and that's why they could only offer us outdoors. From where we sat, we could look through the glass partition and saw 2 empty tables and 2 other tables with diners already finishing their meals. We were about to ask the service staff if we could move indoors but we overheard the man sitting at the next table ask if he and his family could have the indoor table instead. The service staff said the waiting time to get a table indoor is half an hour so they had no choice but to stay put.The 4 tables were never occupied by the time we finished our meals. Was there discrimination? Or was it poor management? It wasn't a good experience from the start. We told the service staff we were ready to order and her response was "one minute". Nothing happened. Another staff passed by and we said we were ready to order and she said "yes" but walked away. We were getting upset and I had to raise my voice to get the attention of the first service staff that we were ready to order. If you dine outdoors, you get paper towels. If you dine indoors you get proper cloth napkins. Prices of the food are not cheap and we definitely expected better service. Jaime, seriously, do something
4
went to Jamie's Italian during lunch. They have lunch offer which very nice and worth the price. Overall good foo

......NO. I wonder if he would like the reservation system in the first place. You call a phone number in order to get a SMS link to reserve online before someone calls you back an hour later to confirm the reservation. How efficient is that???The reception at the restaurant is professional but not really friendly. This is true also for the hosts during the evening. The food is - in the best case - average. The steak was good but not the whole piece of meat was eatable. The taste of the spaghettis was good as well but many of the noodles were stuck together, something you would not expect in an Italian restaurant. The water glasses are stacked when stored, so they are covered with calcium stains. Bottom line - you pay too much for what you get.Jamie, try another restaurant instead or do something with this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1
I brought a friend who is a first time visitor. Guess what. After ordering the three course dinner, the starter of King Oyster came quite quickly but just a few miserable pieces of breaded stuff? Come on. Kids meal? Worse. Waited more than 25min for the entree, called a waiter and he told us kitchen has a gas problem. No cooking can be done. How wonderful and perfect timing. No compensation for a drink to have kept us waiting, no offer to void the food and suggest alternatives. Nothing. We waited for another 10min. Exasperated. I called one of the manager to find out the status and told him he's wasting our time and we need to leave to find a decent food elsewhere. He had no choice but to let us leave. Look. Gas problem is not uncommon. Service staff should be quick to offer atonement as soon as they can or even a voucher for a return trip since we don't get to eat any decent food there. But nil. Totally disappointed.
5
I had a wonderful dining experience with my family at the Vivocity restaurant. They accommodated my late request for a reservation, and we were given an excellent seat with ample space for my party of 7. Food was lovely; the pastas and pizzas were fantastic. I received excellent from all the staff. *A notable mention was the honesty the staff had exhibited when they called my hand-phone to inform me that a member of my family had left his watch behind
1
First, the service was bad. The waitress who brought us to the table dropped a glass near us, fortunately the glass did not hurt us. Throughout the meal, it was hard to get attention from the servers.The food was horrible. The mushroom risotto came first, which was alright. Not quite worth the $26.50 paid. THE FAMOUS GARLIC PRAWN PASTA WAS SO WRONG. It didn't even taste of garlic. And the linguine was undercooked to the extent it tasted floury when you bite into it. The pasta also had clumps- proof that the chef did not stir it properly. When we returned the plate after 2 bites, the waitor told us to cut the noodles in front of him in case it is al dente and not undercooked. ARE YOU QUESTIONING YOUR CUSTOMERS!? In any case, it was obvious that we had a case so they took it back and cooked another plate for us. The second plate had hard pasta but at least edible.Honestly, I do not expect food of such standard and servce in a restaurant with a brand. They said 'See you again' when we were leaving but sorry, you are not having us as your customers again. Poco Loco at AMK has food that's 10 times better and half the price.
5
Awesome food and service was great. They went an extra mile just to accommodate to my dietary restrictions. Thanks guys!
4
If all the meats served at the restaurant are indeed pasteurised, then perhaps the price is worth it. $38 for a pork chop with just 3-4 leaves on the side (I requested salad) is expensive if it was just conventional meat
5
We visited Jamies last night. Had the most amazing prawn linguine and garlic rolls that actually tasted of garlic. Very attentive and friendly service from our waiter Manimaron. Lovely respectful young man.
4
Very good experience. Been here for many times.. nice atmosphere and nice foods. Kids have playbag to keep them busy.
4
This was an enjoyable restaurant with fairly standard but good quality Italian food in orchard Road singapore and a change from the usual local food. The place was busy and the service was fine and the cost reasonable.
5
We came across this restaurant after a day on Sentosa. We were take to a table by the windows overlooking the water which were nice. Our drinks order was taken quickly and the drinks arrived just as fast. The food was amazing. We ordered the Italian nachos for entree, which was intriguing, and as our mains we had lasagne and arrabiata, which were both delicious and filling. We drank Sommersbys cider with our meal which was on promotion, so we had plenty to drink and it wasn't too expensive for a change in Singapore .The highlight of this dining experience was the staff. They ensured that we were well looked after, including our 11 month old son, and couldn't thank them enough. Due to our experience here, we visited another Jamie's Italian on Orchard Rd a couple of days later

Firstly, I should say that the outside eating area is closed for renovation at this time. Which is a shame, it has a great location by the waterfront which is not appreciated if you sit inside.Secondly, the temperature inside is very cold indeed. So take something to keep you warm in the arctic conditions!Now to the food. That was very nice, as you might expect from one of Jamie's outlets. The food I would give a strong "4". It isn't fine dining, but neither are the prices, which are quite reasonable for Singapore. Overall good value.The disaster area is the bar service. It seems the chef can cook a pizza faster than the bar tender can pour half a pint of beer. The first took 15 minutes to arrive. The second took 20 minutes. Not good enough
5
The food was really delicious. I was worried the steak was going to be tough as I couldn't order it medium. But the server assured me that while it's usually served medium-well, it would still be soft because they pound the steak first. And indeed it really was not tough at all.
1
Over collection of GST, I utilized voucher for the value of the item but restaurant levied service charge and tax on the price before voucher and insisted this is their system setup as advised by Finance. this violates GST law. Two same pizzas ordered, one was missing capers topping
3
The restaurant was located at the end of the shopping centre, next to Harbourfront Centre. The restaurant was packed during dinner but we got our table easily as I had made reservation a week again. Although the restaurant looked quite dark at the entrance, we were swiftly showed to a bright looking table overlooking the sea view.For restaurant week, the restaurant was having a sugar and spice menu which cost $38++ for dinner. There were 2 choices for antipasti. Roasted Chilli Pepper Caprese BruschettaToasted ciabatta brushed with garlic, topped with buffalo mozzarella, sweet roasted peppers, cherry tomatoes & fresh basilBeware of the roasted peppers. While juicy, it tasted quite spicy too. The cheese was melted in the mouth.Proper Pumpkin SoupThe creamiest pumpkin soup ever, spiced with fresh nutmeg, with crispy aubergine & natural yogurtIt was a rich creamy sweet soup with a tab minty taste.For Secondi, we selected 2 out of the 3 choices available.Steak Tagliata220g Grilled Ribeye, spiced & cooked al mattone, crunchy fennel salad, wiggly chilli, loadsa herbs, zesty lemon & olive oil.The steak was cooked just nice. Interestingly flavored with the minty and zesty sauce.Our Famous Prawn LinguineFried garlicky prawns, shaved fennel, tomatoes, chilli & rocket.The linguine was soaked up the flavours, topped with juicy prawns.For desserts : Crema Alla VanigliaSweet vanilla cream topped with marshmallow meringue & cinnamon poached pear.It looked so sweet with the flamed touched meringue. It was light and sweet finish to a heavy meal.Hot Chocolate & Chilli FondantFreshly baked oozy chocolate pudding sightly spiced with chilli, with salted caramel ice cream.It was served warm, topped with ice cream. I would prefer it to be served pipping hot with the chocolate lava flowing out. It not hot enough to have the molten chocolate flow. The spicy taste was there but not too bad.On top of the restaurant week menu, we also ordered a number of dishes from the ala carte menu.Chicken Milanese ($28.50++)Free-range chicken stuffed with prosciutto & fontal cheese, breadcrumbed & topped with a free-range egg & truffle oilWhile crispy outside, inside was cheesy creamy and juicy.Parma Pizza ($27.50)It was the special pizza of the day, recommended by the staff. The pizza was light and crispy. Tomato base, topped with parma ham and rocket.Crispy Squid ($23.50++/ large)With garlic & lemon mayo, chilli, parsley & fried garlicIt looked quite small for large serving. It was crispy and chewy. Overall the food was not bad. The services was great with the funny and helpful staffs attending to us
4
Ambience was great. Service was a tad slow (waited quite a long time for water). The pasta and garlic bread were lovely but the price was quite steep for the really small portions.
4
food is good. Atmosphere good. Service is too slow. Will be ok for dinner not so rushy. Food big portion. Yummy desserts. Best for relaxing as service slow.
4
Good food though portions a little small. Kids pack and crayon was fantastic and keeping them occupied.
4
Constantly good meal, service, setting and menu. Some very good 'Happy Hour' deals before 7.00pm and fixed lunch and evening menus.
5
I found " the day special dish" was over priced. I regretted that I should order the set meal instead that dish.
3
Have recently visited Jamies whilst in Singapore with my 13 year old daughter. We were both looking forward to the experience. The pasta was average - not outstanding. The polenta chips were however great as was the panacotta for dessert. The views are really nice and ambience was pleasant as were the staff. My only criticism is that I found it overpriced for a basic mid week lunch. There are plenty of eateries in Vivocity to choose from and I dont think I would return on our next visit
3
If you just fancy Italian cuisine and you are at Vivo, then I Guess it will not harm going there. Of course, you will not be looking for value for money or you will be disappointed, as the prices are high compared to what you get.
1
Am working closely to Vivo City, so Jamie's is certainly an obvious option to go with a business partner. But is such an disappointment. Had the recommendation of the day: "pizza with parma ham, loaded with ricotta and parmesan"; 28.50 S$ and you end up with four (4!) small slices of some sort of ham - parma ham from Huberts Butcher tastes different, four (4!) teaspoon-size small pieces of ricotta and a bit if parmesan and I guess I counted 7-8 leaves of rocket salad. Food cost of that dish must be under 10%. Bravo Jamie!
5
Service is efficient and thoughtful at Jamie's Italian Kitchen at Vivocity. The meals are delicious although not as amazing as you expect from a restaurant chain connected to a Michelin starred Chef. WIne selection is decent. Definitely try the Prawn Linguine or the Crab Spaghettini as they are delicious
5
Food is nice and the service is good. Enjoyed the dinner with my family there. I must say that the kids meal is awesome. Healthy and no processed food unlike many other places. Great healthy place for kiddos too and my kids love it.
3
Food ok, nothing spectacular!
Environment wise I find it a little crowded, would prefer if they can space out a little.
5
Great tasting and well presented food. Great place for the whole family with a lot of different options on the menu.
4
After a nice day at the studios, went to Jamie's where the service was very good, both ordered pasta they were nice however one lacked the meat but upon informing the staff this was resolved promptly. Lovely experience overall would return. Well done Jamie...
2
We had a dinner at the restaurant. We had high expectations but were disappointed. We ordered safe starters, tomato bruschetta. There was only one piece (too small for the price!) and taste was ok. The main course pizza was slightly over roasted and there was a burnt smell to mushrooms. The pumpkin ravioli was very one dimensional, too sweet, and little bland. We landed up spending $97 and left feeling little hungry. My opinion the food is less in quantity and not up to the mark in taste for the price we pa
4
On weekdays there is an excellent set lunch - 2 courses for around $24 and 3 courses for $29. For appetisers we had the frito misto - deep fried assorted seafood which included fish and squid- tasty esp with the tartar sauce. For mains the beef burger was huge and v well done. The best course was the last - the chocolate brownie is decadent and the pavlova v well done.The ala carte menu had excellent dishes too - the prawn linguine and the special - beef lasagne was superb.Excellent value for money
3
We were looking for a pizzeria at Vivo city and came across Jamie's. We ordered a classic (very safe choice) Margherita, a prawn linguine and a fresh crab pasta. Steep Price for 3 items - $80 Plus including service charge and GST. The pizza was good, and the fresh crab pasta was ok. The disappointment was on the prawn linguine though. All said, we probably won't return for this place as it's definitely not value for $$$. We have enjoyed better pastas with the same price range at other sophisticated Italian restaurants such as Prego at Fairmont Hotel.
4
I bought the Chope vouchers for the dinner, however in the end we ordered one dinner set and was unable to use it. Happy with the dinner and food with my Boyfriend. :
4
Had dinner here with my friends and I ordered the rump steak and it was pretty decent, not really a wow factor. But for a celebrity restaurant, this place is considered pretty affordable but don't expect too much on the food. Staff were friendly and service was good. Heard from my friends the breakfast here was really good, so maybe I will try it one day
5
Stumbled upon the resultant by chance & I must say that it is the most Amazing restaurant with the most delicious vegetarian food I have ever eaten anywhere in the world! The ambiance was excellent & the staff very obliging. Will definitely go back!
4
For first timers, we missed out that the dinner set steak already comes with fries and thus we ordered 1 to come with the appetisers. The server missed to remind us about it. If she had mentioned it, we wouldn't order a second portion. We weren't used to the strong alcohol taste of the tiramisu either. It was too strong since we were already enjoying a bottle of moscato
3
Pleasant experience in general. Food was okay but didn't really like my pasta. The linguine was abit hard, the rest was okay. Might visit again.
4
We went in for a quick working lunch and were surprised by the choices and the portions! very good value for money and excellent service.

Jamie's Italian was a place I was looking forward to visit for the past few months especially because my fiance is a huge fan of Jamie Oliver and she had successfully built my hopes high up for his establishment to serve some good quality, delicious food. But I cannot be further away from the truth. This was by far the worst food experience in terms of taste, texture, as well as service I ever had in Singapore. I was seated outdoors facing the beautiful Harbourfront view. I had ordered a Jamie's Italian burger. I was told by the waiter after 20 minutes of waiting that they had to re-cook the burger as the first one got over cooked. Hence, after 40 minutes wait, I was looking forward to sink my teeth into a tasty, juicy burger. But what I got was another overcooked, dry burger. To make matters worse, I waited for 10 minutes to get the attention of a waiter, which I failed to receive. In the end, after eating just enough to partially fill my stomach, I waited for another 5 minutes to find someone who can give me the cheque. Finally, tired of the experience, I went inside to pay the bill. So, in conclusion, I will not recommend this restaurant to anyon
5
Jamie's is our guilty pleasure in Singapore, we probably go more often than we should bearing in mind Singapore is full of fantastic food! But Jamie's always delivers and when you are in need of a good tasty meal, you can't go wrong. We are sometimes lucky enough to be well looked after by one of the servers, Mark, he is, by far the epitome of great service! He always gives us a great welcome whether we are sat in his area or not, Jamie's is very lucky to have him
1
It was one of those rare evenings I felt sitting outside. So why not ... let's try famous Jamie's ...as I was craving for some italian food.As an Italian I should not experiment the Italian cuisine by a non italian chef.Sorry Jamie I know you are very famous but there would be a lot to learn for a real "arrabbiata" (as we tried that beside the pizza and some polenta chips!!)The birra Moretti however was served chilled... which was great
1
First and last time to this restaurant. Both my boyfriend and myself ordered 2 different types of steak. My steak was dry, tough and burnt when I asked for medium. For something that cost $29+, it was so thin and apart from the burnt taste, it was pretty tasteless. The fries that came along with it was dry and hard like it was either fried for too long or it was just microwaved. My boyfriend's steak cost $46+, slightly better than what I had ordered. It was at least twice the thickness of my skinny steak but as tasteless as my burnt skinny steak. Service was still OK but the food was horrible. Prices of the food is totally ridiculous for such quality. It's a total rip-off dining there
1
The were too many customers. I change the reservation from 8 pm to 7.30 pm but the person who took the call did not tell me there was a 15 mins waiting time till I arrive at 7.55 pm. I waited for 20 mins for my table which is exactly the time they told me the table will be ready then I have to wait one hour for my food. Overall the service was below par and not enough service staff. I will not go agai
2
Ordered the Famous Prawn linguine, Pork Chop and kids meal.Meals were overrated...with exorbitant pricing.Linguine was so-so; it is comparable to places like pizzahut, swensens which are not even al dente for Italian food...The pork chop was a turn off...with thick fat lards of fats all over the meat (at least 40% fats) makes it quite a measly and disgusting experience (still managed to chomp it down as we were rushing off to another meeting with no chance of food). The only decent dish was the kids meals, which essentially tasted like tomato sauce/gravy with steamed fish.However, i must say the service is good, attentive and reliable. The waiter is always at hand to recommend, attend and serve our needs
4
I've been to Jamie's Italian twice recently with my family, once at Forum and the other, VivoCity . And both times I had the Prawn Linguine. Gosh! That dish is totally delicious!!! Even thinking of it is making my mouth water and stomach leap and roll in anticipation. Somehow the sauce, with its blend of fish, tomato, saffron, chillies, lemony rocket and the lot turns into a superb concoction. One drawback on the second visit was the initial service. Perhaps, because of the language barrier, there were problems in communication. The service staff even sounded a little irate. However, soon after matters improved and the same staff member became courteous and helpful.I like the spacious, warm layout.I see myself going back to Jamie's Italian again and again.. with or without the family.. for my 'Prawn Linguine'
4
We ordered 2 sets of Italian steak and fries and loved the refreshing taste with herby tomato salsa and Parmesan cheese. The set lunch came with dessert and the tiramisu was good. The price of the set lunch was affordable for a restaurant with good ambiance and service. Waiters were very attentive and polite. We had a satisfying lunch!Will definitely visit again
4
Had crab spaghetti that was well prepared. Attentive service. Ambience on Orchard Road outlet is noisy and not a romantic dining spot but the food was good.
4
My family and I dined at Jamie's Italian at Vivo City for lunch and had a really pleasant experience with the food, staff and environment (we sat outside looking at Sentosa Island). My husband had the arancini balls as his starter and thinks they're the best arancini balls he's ever had. An overall lovely experience although on the tad more expensive side
4
Dined with the family at Jamie's Italian and the food was nice and healthy. I personally admire how Jamie designs his menu with the health in mind and with the aim of getting good wholesome food into kids as well as adults. The kids meal were healthy and balanced with vegetables and to my surprised, the kids found it fun and ate some (not all) of the vegies. I was of course very pleased with this fact. I don't mind paying the kind of prices at this place just to see my kids eat vegies. lolWe had the nachos, steak and fries, famous prawn linguine and the kids meals - lollipop chicken and cheese burgers. And for desserts - chocolate lava cake and ice cream. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience for us. However, what needs improvement is the service element. Up to the point when I requested for the bill, the service was fine. We were ushered to our table and a waitress took our orders without fuss. When it came to the bill, I had to politely ask 3 times before the bill was brought to me. I would be happy to walk off without paying if it's really so hard for them to bring my bill. Something for the restaurant manager to remind the serving team but overall, I would definitely bring my family back again

Celebrated our Wedding Anniversary on a busy Saturday night. Despite the crowd, service staffs were attentive. Food were great, portion were huge too (we had the pork chop). Will we come to this restaurant again? - Certainty!

First time to any Jamie Oliver restaurant. Expected a nice dinner with warm ambience. Got hard rock music blaring from speakers throughout the entire duration instead, with some "songs" sounding like screeching heavy metal. It was so loud even my hearing-loss suffering friend commented the deafening music was causing a headache. Almost left, but decided to wait for food which to our dismay took a pretty long time to arrive, (the restaurant was not very crowded). Only the bread which arrived almost instantly but it was stone cold and in a few pieces very roughly cut. By the way, the bread, we soon noticed, with alarm, was placed on a table right in the middle of the restaurant, completely exposed to anyone passing by who coughs/sneezes/talks over it. Hardly the practice of food hygiene for any eatery in Singapore. The only redeeming element of this whole saga was the waiting staff who was attentive. Kudos to her. But the price for the meal was sky high for an abysmal dinner ambience with standard fare of cheap to mediocre quality at best. Food cleanliness has left a big question mark. Have the feeling of being ripped off by the Jamie Oliver name. The overall experience was extremely disappointing

Food is not fantastic as the steak was cold . Serving of food is very fast, feel like eating fastfood at Mac Donald.Only enjoy the french fries as there are more spices than usual ones
4
Friday lunch time catching up with a friend. Service was great. Food was good. Only downside was my dessert - cheesecake meringue, the cheesecake part was a little frozen not sure if that was hope it was supposed to be but not what I was expecting.
3
What do you expect from a restaurant of a world famous chef Jamie Oliver, delicious food, consistentcy and great service, right?But you won't get any of it. Food quality is bad and slow service makes it even worse. I have been here a couple of times (Jan, 2014 and Aug 2014), my first time experience was not bad except for the service. Antipasti and ravioli tasted good and fresh lime soda was good. We ordered same soda next time we visited, it taste weird and ravioli also tasted bad. Very bad experience. Did not expect it from a Jamie Oliver restaurant.
2
Expected much better, attracted by the Jamie Oliver name, but very disappointed. Food was bland, Italian steak completely tasteless, service average. Ambience OK but too noisy
3
It was an occasion to celebrate my son's birthday so we thought give it a try. It was a Saturday night busy but not full house. They had a board with the day's special but it was not obvious and behind some tables. It was awkward to stare and look at the board as though inviting trouble what more to try snap a picture of the board for easy reference. [Please relocate the board]Prices were high and portions were tiny compared to Dan Ryan's. We had to have supper an hour after dinner ended. We had to try very hard to get the attention of the servers/waiters when we needed them, even for the bill payment.Unlike most restaurants they DO NOT provide a complimentary dessert or cake for birthday's, even PuTien does that with balloon hats and photos. [Listen and learn jamie's]. It was not a big deal but a let down which overall we will probably not recommend friends there but across the aisle to Poulet
5
Took family of 17 for Dinner, staff fantastic. Happy hour before 7, buy on get one free. Food delicious, very enjoyable experience , all happy with there meals, one comment best pizza they have every eaten.
3
Ordered the prawn pasta and burger. Overall a rather decent meal but had expected better from Jamie's kitchen
4
Nice family restaurant. Kids were kept occupied with the goody bag. Food portions are big. Service staff were attentive.
2
The fish was nice, except for the fish scales which were very annoying, ravioli was nice, rump steak, medium, was decent but the pasta, apparently they serve it differently than Al dente. Tasted too hard for me. Servers didn't seem like they enjoyed working here, chefs cooking seemed to be arguing.
3
Lovely unique food in quaint rustic type setting but...The four of us celebrating our anniversaries had disaster of service from the kitchen and front staffOrders taken on $39.00 3 course special menus. Not once did the food arrive altogether. But worse was to come when after we had ordered told that 2 of the 4 entrees were not available. Same thing again with main course but it was no longer funny when twice the desserts we ordered were not available after one was served then 3 others had sold out...not anywhere near good enough!Top this off but at no time over 2 hours were we asked for drinks! We decided not to remind staff and just have table water... Very disappointing indeed,Such a shame as we loved all the food served when...it eventually came.If the staff or management read this review they should feel extremely embarrassed.
5
If u're thinkin of beautifully plated dishes with flavours and infusions u've never heard or tasted before, look no further! The pork chop was sensational, the seafood stew was awesome and came with 2 slices of toasted loaf slices with shredded lobster/crab on top and yummy nachos with the kick A** salsa dip! (Could have gave a bit more chips though
4
Thumbs up to the front of house for keeping her smile even when she was swarmed continuously. We turned up on time and was promptly ushered to our table. Food and service were prompt as well amidst the chaos of this very busy restaurant. Well done.
3
The burgers were ok, but nothing special. The place is overpriced and it might be ok for one meal, but would not be going back for sure. P.s. The staff is nice!
2
Went with 2 other friends. There were numerous staff around, but all seemed to congregate in front of the kitchen, so had to wave quite a bit to get their attention. Food was overpriced and tasted quite ordinary. The serving size of my pork chop was good, but it was extremely dry and overcooked. The carrot side salad was also surprisingly dry. My friend ordered the crab linguine, and it was soggy with only a few shreds of crab. Not a good experience. We decided to skip dessert and had ice cream at a different place
5
Enjoyed an early family dinner here after a last shop in Singapore. Not cheap but Jamies restaurants are the same everywhere.The crab spaghetti was fantstic and enjoyed the seafront location looking out over Sentosa Island.Kids enjoyed the caesar salad and brushetta
3
With the entertainer app my family tried it out. Food was on the salty side. Pizza was okay, beef bolognaise was alright. Skip the anti pasti and the crab spaghetti
3
family of 5 so tasted lots of dishes and nothing good to note for any of them accept they over salt everything which is usually a sign of using average quality ingredients. Will not return and will not recommend to anyone (i like)
5
Loved the food here everything was great not over expensive compared to most of Singapore had the penne Arrabiarta & mushrooms aranchi which where absolutely spit on. Drinks were expense but the again I found mist drinks expensive in singapore
4
PROS :
+ Good atmosphere
+ Nice view toward the harbour
+ Food taste nice
+ Friendly waiters
CONS :
+ A bit pricey compared to other steak house
4
Loving the decor and ambience at Jamie's. The staff were friendly but they're too busy so service might be abit slow.
5
One of our favorite resto and reminds us of lovely homecook dish flavorfull, simple yet satisfied appetite, it will really have a satisfaction on your taste buds. Good customer service cute ambiance and for most you can also buy Jamie's cookware, spices, etc. Highly rec. and you will be delighted with the delicious food
2
I was not impressed with the food here. Ordered the burger - something simple...and it tasted like it had been fried in engine oil on a dirty old grill. Once I "deconstructed" it, in a way that I could actually eat it (it is presented in the most ridiculously inedible way - unless you cant drop your jaw a good 20cm to fit it in..you cant cut it without the whole thing falling apart from all the lettuce), I actually forced myself to eat nearly half of it and gave the rest to my husband who thought it was nice, but who has a higher tolerance of greasy, crap food than me. The chips looked liked they had been dragged off the top of the fryer from the last few batches, you know when there really isn't a real chip in sight, just the small pointy pieces which taste like and resemble batter rather than potato. I mean really, how can you f#@! up a burger! I started regretting I didn't get the lasagna, until the guy next to me had it delivered to his table and it looked like molten lava, cooked to within an inch of its life. And the cost of this below average meal...don't get me started! You are paying for the marketing and name here...and everyone is falling for it
4
Got addicted and went to Jamies Vivo this time round after last week Jamies Forum. Spacious, less crowd. Just as awesome as Forum outlet. Last week went with friends who likes Italian food and it was great experience! Yesterday went with friends who at first didn't fancy Italian but in the end was amazed by food there! Keep up the standard of food! Cheers
4
Went on entertainer app 1-for-1 main course. Decor was unique and certainly British-like. Service was prompt with wait staffs being friendly and helpful. Had nicest garlic bread ($9) ever as appetiser. Main courses worth mentioning were Venetian seafood stew and rump steak with fries. Place was crowded on Sunday evening so make sure you have reservation
3
Went there on an entertainer app deal. Waiter got my one of my order wrong. I'm not fussy since I'm getting that dish free. Problem is, the free fishy pizza was really fishy and it would have been better if I didn't experience that. Just not my kind of taste. The otter chicken pizza was ok. I think I prefer Spizza for pizzas
3
This is a poor imitation of the hall Mark Jamie in London . If you want Italian food in singapore there are several other options . Only saving grace is it's location by waterfront and decor.
Food of basic standard and very pricy .
4
very convenient location...early dinner to skip the crowd..very well presentation on food and taste good!
4
Service was fast and good. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Although food were a little pricey but it taste great!
4
It was a good experience. We were 5 ppl and there were lot of choices for both vegetarian as well as non veg food
4
Provided crafts for kids to keep them occupied.
Service staff not as attentive as I would have liked. Had to put up hands for water refill for a long time before it gets acknowledged
1
Poor services. Need to wait yet no table. Poor organising.should train staff to be more polite in future. Just patron others next time.
3
My family of 3 (2 adults + 1 toddler) visited the restaurant last Sat at around 5+pm. We wanted to beat the crowd!We were greeted by this friendly host whom ushered us to our table promptly. After we told her that we will be using 'The Entertainer' app, she was still all smile and friendly and guided us on what can be ordered from the menu. Too bad I didnt capture her name. Thank YOU! Upon seated, we were then served by this gentleman (in white shirt; supervisory or leading wait staff role?) who seemed like he had a bad day.. All so gloomy with no smile. I felt sorry for him that he wasn't able to take a day off to chill somewhere. But in all fairness, he wasn't rude or anything but just gloomy, no smile, no greetings.We ordered the steak, a pizza, Polenta fries and a glass of iced cappuccino. The food arrived in decent timing. But, we were surprised that the 2 mains arrived cold (room temperature; no heat at all). The pizza definitely didnt feel like just out of the oven kind. We were disappointed with the steak too. Temperature of the food as well as the meat quality. Not that we are expecting the Morton's grade of steak given the price that we paid; but we are definitely expecting something better than Astons'. Think you might get luckier with the steak at Astons. Even the fries that came along with the steak was cold. The coleslaw was a saving grace though!! Nice touch on the peppermint leaves served together with the salad dish!The Polenta was the only one running a slight temperature.. ha! but a tad too salty for our taste buds.During payment time, we asked for the check. The same gentlemen in white shirt simply passed us the bill and went away. He didnt acknowledge us or tell us anything. My husband and I were pondering for a good few mins on whether the payment should be made at the main door area or what. Till I saw that another customer made his payment at his seat (served by another server) then we knew that we were required to wait. True enough, the gentleman in white came back again after a few mins, with the wireless credit card machine in his hand. We didnt think of doing any feedback that day cos we didnt want to spoil the nice saturday evening (I dont want to get my husband started.. wahahahaha)! We just finished our food and left. Will we return again? Most probably not. You can definitely get better quality food and service elsewhere
3
So for S$65 for 2 mains and a coke seems a bit excessive for Singapore standards.We had the linguine ($26) and a Caesar salad ($24), coke was $5 - plus service and tax it came to $65.Food was good, but not that good. I think the novelty of "Jamie" is what draws the crowds, but really it is standard fare
5
great place for a nice friday night dinner. crowded but atmosphere was generally pleasant. food was fantastic, slightly pricey thoug
4
James's has a nice location by the waterfront and had a welcoming decor inside. Our dishes of seafood linguine, carbonara, and chicken salad were all good. Good to have some squid plus bread basket to start with. Service was also attentive. Just remember that it will be more expensive than traditional food in Singapore
3
Great staff good food but a little pricey given the quality. Healthy kids menu which unfortunate kids don't appreciate
5
Food was good, nice atmosphere, nice staff and service. Close to mrt. Perfectly fpt the one who love italian food
2
Word to the wise, an abode bearing a famous chef's moniker doesn't guarantee a decent dinner whatsoever...
The dishes were insipid and sterile, huge letdown...
3
Food was no doubt good but it was kinda hard trying to get the staffs attention in ordering food or even the bill.
1
Came here with my Wife. Ordered a red wine 'Cianti classici'. It came out very warm. Sent it back and the waiter wanted to argue that it was fine ...... It was almost hot !!! Crap !!
3
Had dinner here recently with a few others. Ordered six dishes plus a side of bread plate. We had mains, pasta and pizza. The dish that took my vote is the wild mushroom pizza. This was crispy and fragrant. The snapper was quite disappointing. We had not ordered the duck but saw other tables had - it looked good
3
Jamie's Italian in Vivocity is a fine place to go if you feel in urge for some western food when travelling in Asia. It is not Italian in the Italian way, but dishes are well done, and the taste is good. Portions are medium to big, and everything was served to us quite quickly.We did not get close to the staff, and you feel the same way of intimacy as you do in a well driven McDonalds/Burger King and so on. You order, have your food, pay and leave. No big experiences or nice suggestions will surprise you at Jamie's Italian, but you will get good food in a decent atmosphere not too far away from the other Jamie's restaurants around the world
5
The place was overlooking a body of water which I thought was the main pull for this but it was the attentive nature of the waiters who were there to provide each customer a great experience. Salute to them i may say :)The food was okay but to get that service was the best
3
We came here for a Saturday lunch. Service was good and not that many people inside. We started to order the bruschetta but then we were informed that its only one portion. So we decided to go with the baked mushroom dish so we could share it and that's was very good and I think the high light of the meal. My girlfriend had the Rigatoni Arrabbiata which she liked because it was nice and spicy. But we both agreed the pasta tasted a little under cooked for both our taste. I had the pumpkin ravioli just try something different. I wasn't to impressed with it. To start with I never had pasta served with water still on the plate with olive oil floating on it. There was no sauce of any kind just chopped pieces of pumpkin on top. The flavor was ok but a little to sweet for me and all the water was just strange to me. Over all just not what we expected. I don't think we would go back
4
Some of the dishes are good, recommend the garlic bread and fried squid. The waiting time is considered long so if you are very hungry, you will want to think it twice. However, all dishes came almost the same time. The staff is also very friendly which really brings up the experience level
3
Average food taste with expensive price. Nice ambience for family or couples. Service provided is good.
5
Request was fulfill. Awesome service. Good ambience. Steak is awesome however crab spaghetti isn't that nice. Overall is a nice place for birthday celebration. Thanks for the service.
2
I visited this place in early 2015, can't remember the exact month but was extremely disappointed. We had to wait for our orders for 45 minutes. Not only that the food we got were extremely salty and we gave up. Not worth the price and the wait
3
Found the restaurant by accident and walked in hoping to find authentic Italian food. We did not think that Jamie Oliver's level would open a fusion Italian restaurant here. Anyway, we thought about getting Bruschetta for appetizer and having it to share. The waitress told us that it would be one portion for each and was not meant to share. So we opted the Baked mushroom instead. It was good, we liked it as it was bit different. As for the main, I ordered Rigatoni Arrabbiata and my boyfriend ordered Pumpkin Ravioli just to try something new. The rigatoni that I had was quite spicy with chopped chili parmesan and bread crumbs. It was good considering I like spicy food although the pasta needs to be cooked a bit longer. Meanwhile, my boyfriend was not impressed with the ravioli as it was watery and needs to be reduced. The taste is quite sweet from the pumpkin. Overall, we think this restaurant, with Jamie Oliver's name on it was just below our expectation. Again, this is not exactly the place to find a real authentic Italian food. We expect more pizza options in the menu. However, it is a nice place to relax and enjoy the scenery as it faces Sentosa island
1
Me and my wife had visited Jamies Italian for the very first and the last time on a Monday evening. Our first impression was that the people assigning you your table are behaving as if they are doing a huge favor on you.We got our table and after several calls to many passing by servers we finally managed to get some attention to place our order, we ordered vegetarian Plank, Wild mushroom and truffle oil risotto, and a pumpkin ravioli along with ginger beer for drinks.After the server left our area was left with a strange smell, we realized later that our server had a bad stomach, now we all have bad days but this was absolutely unexpected.The food came super quick. First bite into it and I did not wanted to take the second one. My risotto was under cooked with hard rice grains, it had Japanese mushrooms which i dont think should belong in an italian dish. I then tasted my wife pumpkin ravioli and it looks as if it came out of a deep freezer, it was definitely not freshly made, it was also under cooked and way to hard on the corners, the sauce was watery and had no body to it.Now when i go to a upscale celebrity owned and run restaurant, I have a simple expectation of good food and good service, unfortunately this restaurant had given me none of the above.Having said i must say the home made ginger beer was amazing.All in all we paid SGD100 for a very poor service and a horrible food, I would prefer a food court stall over this any time. Sorry to say Jamie, but your Restaurant sucks....!!
2
I was very disappointed with the food at Jamies. Their home made pasta tasted grainy, quite different from the other types of home made pasta. Was having high expectations after watching Jamie cook on TV, but I guess what looks good on TV doesn't actually taste good
4
Clearly Jamie is known, and he plays around with the menu and the ingredient to serve some quite interesting dishes (never expected to find a hamburger in an Italian restaurant - a heresy). The food is good, is special, unlike the standard fare in most others (which does not mean they are not at least as good as well). Here you come when you want to try new combination, feel creative. Would recommend reservations to be sure, and don't fiddle around your smartphones or talk while you eat. This one needs to be enjoyed.
2
We booked through CHOPE and asked for a quiet table where we could hear ourselves talk specifically in our online booking. This was acknowledged when we arrived and I clarified that I did not want to be placed under a speaker with loud music. We were promptly shown to a small square table near the windows ( good view) RIGHT under a loud speaker. There were other cosy and empty tables with more space for 4 and nicely enclosed in booths but we were not assigned those. The table was of raw wood and reeked of old unwashed cloth.We lost our appetites and were worried about the hygiene of the place. It took some time to get attention when we wanted to order.The experience was so negative we decided to just leave and go to another restaurant.I can' rate the food as we did not eat there, am just basing it on the choices in the menu and our previous experience with their restaurant in Cambridge
4
Late lunch/early dinner. Had the Linguini bolognese and my girlfriend had the lamb chops. We also had the Nachos (a very different take on a traditional Nachos but it works) and tried the Italian Mojitos. Service was attentive and almost instant. Food served quickly and to order. Pricing is high but this is Singapore and anything with alcohol pushes up the prices too crazy levels but that is not Jamie's issue. We been to Jamie's Italian Forum in Orchard Street and its the same menu and service (all good) just a different fit out and Vivocity has water views
4
With the reputation about Jamie's, I was looking forward to a sumptuous meal. I normally like to order a simple dish and a more challenging dish to see the range of standard of a good gourmet. I ordered the prawn linguine and the ltalian Steak and fries.The linguine was served with many generous prawn but the texture of the linguine failed. It was not cooked long enough hence there were portion that is too hard and lumpy. The prawns were cooked well though.The steak is better served with a flash grilled piece though it would taste better if the steak is thicker. The steak served is about 0.3-0.4cm in thickness only. The ambience is great with a cosy interior completed with a nice view of the Sentosa. The bar counter with the bartender performing n preparing drinks for customers going there to chill. Great place but food standard can be improved.
5
Had a wonderful dinner at Jamie's with family. The food was brilliant and the service was fantastic. Thanks or a wonderful evening, we will be back again when next in town.
2
The courses were cooked well but were flavourless and lacked seasoning. This is the 2nd time ii have experienced this recently at the restaurant and so would be hesitant to eat here again.
4
Place is very nice and clean , food service is very quick , staff is from friendly definitely will come again
4
i ordered prawn linguine (small portion- $18), taste is good but prawn is small. i also ordered 30days.... 280g steak $46 (with fries & rocket) but i find it a bit pricy ... but still the beef taste nice.
3
If you read and listen to the hype you'd be in for a disappointment considering the pricey list of food here. Primarily an Italian restaurant the staple does not fail but you wish there is more to their fettucine and pizza. You know you've tasted it before and better even. Restaurant has a nice view of the harbour
3
Okay, so celebrity chains are here to stay and here in Singapore we love our food so I guess there is a niche for this kind of thing.However...Jamie's Italian is clearly tailored and calculated to the nth degree on budget and raw materials cost. From an F&B perspective, this is a shadow of the concept that hit the market in London in theatre land a few years back when the first couple Mr Oliver's restaurants began to spring up. There are some key principles in evidence especially in terms of the service protocols that have been drummed into the serving staff. Your waiter will be courteous and quite knowledgeable but don't expect them to go too far. Like international call centres that have worked out ways of dealing with about 80% of enquiries you'll find the same pattern in these restaurants. The simple answer to this phenomenon is to give wait staff more autonomy and freedom within the company's parameters but you can't do that 'on the cheap' as that kind of ability comes from experience rather than from teenagers and young adults with 6 months under their belts.Food? Adequate - it's designed, like everything else, to meet a certain minimum standard (which it certainly achieves) but that is all. Pasta is well made and seems quite fresh. The sauces have that rather metallic/preservative taste that seems to come from pre-packed batch sauces (one packet serves 100 - you know the kind of thing).Some items on the menu (such as chips and garlic bread) are cynically small portions served in away that suggests promise until it arrives at the table. In my portion of chips, served in a mini bucket, I found ten chips (fries to my American friends). Not exactly a huge portion but, I suspect, just as open to portion control as anything else.I wouldn't say any portions were beyond 'adeqaute' in terms of scale but that's what you get from the littl guy in the back who weighs everything religiously.Will I go back? Probably not. We often go to places like this before a movie but I won't be in any rush to give up my friday/saturday night sushi for this (and it costs about the same! Wahiro, I will never pass comments again
2
Food was not to our liking.. pricing wise was a little pricey. Waited quite for our food to be serve. And appetizers was not warm u
5
Firstly, this is not my first time there. But i can say the service was excellent and even better than before. thou the cup wasnt clean on the table given and short of cutlery. Very attentive upon requests. Once of the kids pack was reused. But that doesnt matter. Ha! Serving was quite huge. Afterall dining experience was really great. I have a great birthday lunch. =) cheers
3
Good vibe, average food and pleasant staff. Love the decor and it's authentic feel that was just like the uk version. But somehow for what it was the food felt pricey. In the uk the bruschetta and other starters were always amazing - good value, highly tasty, decent portions for sharing. Here - not the case. Would I come back? For the view, vibe - yes. For the food - not so muc
1
We had family of 4 for dinner. Staff were really friendly but service was slow, kids meatballs were dry as, pizza was dry and flavourless and the cappuccino's to finish were watery.... Certainly expected a lot more from such a branded restaurant. Won't be back
4
This was a good fun night out. Great kids menu, friendly fun staff, a relaxed atmosphere and good food for us. We really liked it and would have returned if we had more time. Nice variety on the menu!
3
Food was good. Wish there are more desserts available and one that is not too heavy. Service staff could be more attentive.
5
Friendly service, good lunch time promotion although limited choice for vegetarians. Great variety on the full menu, delicious food served promptly, will eat there again!
3
Reading at the negative comments it looks to enter an inferno roundabout, it is not true.Nice atmosphere in front of the sea of Harbour Bay, service not bad at all, the food cannot be at Italian level, but cooks put lot of passion on their work and have to be appreciated...They who criticise all and everything, we are in Singapore, not in Rome !!!
2
First, we ordered the crispy squid which was crispy but overcooked. The squid was rubbery and hard to chew.Next came the mains. Fresh crab spagethi which was also overcooked but the crab was fresh. The steak was not medium and much more towards medium well. Hard to chew too and the salad was way too salty. I literally could chew the salt.We were served as a shot limecilla due to a promotion for snapping a selfie. A terrible choice. It was like medicine.I would never return here
5
Great service. Staff were very tentative. Fabulous food. Good variety on offer. Would definitely recommend.
5
We read a whole bunch of negative reviews but decided to try the few positive reviews that we saw from tripadvisor and were really pleasantly surprised !! We also had a crab pasta but thought that was only so-so.. Service was good, although the place was very full on Saturday nigh
2
We ordered prawn Linguine, Tagliatele Bolognese and Spicy Italian Meatballand a bottle of Chianti (see pictures). For the linguine, pasta texture is Aldente, prawn is crunchy but taste bland. Bolognese sauce was too salty. The salt overwhelm the taste of pasta and the ingredient. Pizza crust was way too hard (almost chip the teeth) and not spicy at all. Not tasty, not cheesy and tomato paste was dry. Very disappointing dinner and waste of calories. Total bill was $150 (wine promotion $50, but it is a table wine
5
Awesome lunch deal produced at $21.95, choice of 2 meals. The seafood was a great entree. We had the spaghetti bolognese as main, size was huge, we couldn't finish it. Tiramisu desert was to die for. We were seated near the kitchen so it was great to see the action behind the scenes. Great staff
3
Ate here on a recent trip to Singapore, the prawn linguine had a little too much chilli for my taste and the 'hot and spicy' lovers in our party actually thought the chilli was a bit too powerful and overbearing. The baked mushrooms were a little bland and the chicken Milanese dry but the fish stew and Ricotta bruschetta were deemed tasty by the rest of the party. The staff were friendly, courteous but not intrusive
3
Instead of keep recommending alcohol drinks after we have stated clearly that we did not want to get wine for dinner, the waiters could help more on providing more information of the dishes.
4
Good responsive service. Starter of veggie plank was decent enough. The main course of linguine and burger were good. The desserts - chocolate fondant cake was ok. Tiramisu was nice.
5
Food was good at a reasonable price. Pasta (prawn linguini) was as expected and seafood tomato based chowder (can't remember the exact name) was great. Dessert wasn't as great as the mains but still nice.
5
Decided to have my boyfriend's birthday celebrated in advance and did a special request via chose. The crew for the evening were very efficient and friendly. They helped with the surprise plan and it was such a pleasant surprise for my boyfriend. We really enjoyed the food as well. The pasta is really good and tangy and the 30day matured prime sirloin was bursting with flavour! Definitely will be back for more in the near future
3
My friends love it here, i find the food a tad on the boring and bland side, pasta ok not special!! fries were soggy and tepid, polenta chips/chunks were ok, chocolate pudding and salted caramel icecream nice. Would have loved it to blow me away, but it didnt, staff great view great
2
30 days matured steak - Simply tasteless. Even fries was bad, super soggy, not properly seasoned. Overall, money wasted
4
I thought it was good quality food, and solid kitchen effort. Jamie's Italian might be considered by Singaporeans as overpriced, but that's largely because many of those same complainants are more interested in the lower-end Pastamania. Largely, I loved the pizzas we ordered, especially the Spicy Meatball Pizza. I also thought that the Tagliatalle Bolognese was hearty
3
Maybe I had high expectations, but I would rate this place as average. It's OK for a light lunch/brunch, however it's a bit hyped up. We had to order additional dishes, because it wasn't enough food in the first round we ordered, so I guess the portions are pretty small. And it's pretty hot in Singapore, so you can't eat a lot
2
Very average fare. Grilled chicken in salad was hard like dried leather. Didn't feel like eating. Rest if the dishes were quite disappointing to
4
Every time we visit Singapore as a family, we always make it a point to eat at Jamie's Italian. We've patronized the Forum branch but the Vivo City restaurant is very much better. Always the winner is the prawn pasta and anything on the menu as specials. Highly recommended!
4
Good Italian style restaurant in Singapore. Nice view on Sentosa. Tasty as usual. A bit less olives than it should be though. Good price performance.
5
Nice outlook over the Harbour, Reasonable pricing, $28 for Steak, $20 for Martini, located in the Harbour Vivo Shopping Centre
4
It was a great experience overall. The food and the service was all very good and the waiter was very friendly.

The ppl there very cold face. Looks like that we are not welcomed. Not able to converse in Chinese, not initiated to provide recommendations.
4
Very good dinning experience. Staff reserved/ chopped a good table with a good view. All requests were attended to. Would definitely dine here again

Sometimes big names like this can disappoint. But I was so impressed with everything from the ambience to the service to the presentation at this restaurant , that we feel it was a great choice to celebrate a birthday dinner.The food was quite fancy, but they got it all right. So many options for vegetarians. Loved the food. The pricing wasn't overly exorbitant as well. We payed about 250$ including a bottle of wine for about 6 of us, all vegetarian though! A must try

We had a birthday dinner for my gal as requested by her. We were pleasantly surprised when the staff presented her a complimentary brownie and sang her a birthday song. Staff by the name of Dave was attentive and friendly. Great job

We have heard so much about this "Celebrity Chef" that we decided to give a try to the recently opened "Jamie's Italian" in Singapore's largest shopping mall: VivoCity.The place is relatively big with indoor and outdoor tables, having a pleasant rustic look with some Italian touch; sad to notice that all the nice looking cured meat in the cold cut station is only a plastic reproduction!We ordered a classic Bellini and a jug of Amalfi Lemon & Basil Tea. Both drinks were nice though we do not believe that the floating slices of lemons in the jug come anywhere near the Amalfi coast!We then decided to try the Porcini Arancini and the Spinach & Ricotta Croquettes. The porcini flavor was completely absent and we could not found any trace of the ricotta cheese either.We hoped to have a better luck with the Pizza Margherita. The crust was thin and one could actually taste the fresh tomatoes in the sauce. Pity that the cheese was probably the "American-style" mozzarella and the olive oil was present just in few drops.The Tagliatelle Bolognese were equally disappointing as it was the typical taste of a sauce pre-cooked from a jar, while we had a better luck with the Prawn Linguine, though the prawn were tasteless.At this point, instead of abandoning the fight, we decided to give it one more try ordering Lamb Chop Scottadito with Funky Chips. The Lamb Chops were a bit on the fat side but tasty with some nice peppers and capers, while the funky chips revealed to be ordinary frozen French fries topped with some sliced garlic.We could not leave without testing the dessert selection and, finally, we were pleasantly surprised by the Molten Chocolate Praline Pudding, served with Salted Caramel Ice Cream, honestly the best thing that was served and a reason to probably give this place a second chance.Price was within expectations as we were charged SGD 216.57

Obviously this restaurant trades on the name & we thought things would have been better executed. We dined with our children & the restaurant was quite busy. I had the pasta special of braised beef cheek & it was ok. I asked for some more parmesan & wished I hadn't. Much to my surprise they use the cheap ground up stuff that tastes bad. Not the grana padano that was put on in the kitchen. My wife had the trio of cannelloni's that apparently all tasted very similar & only warm

I visited the Vivocity branch with my family on Mother's Day. My wife and I agreed we will not go there again.The food:I ordered the Chicken Milanese. It was overcooked, dry and tough like jerky. There was no hint of the "prosciutto & fontal cheese" stuffing as described in the menu. And no truffle topping as described either. I only realise the discrepancy now as I am reading the menu online. There was no sauce provided. When I mentioned this to the waiter, he helpfully got the cook to prepare some mushroom gravy for me. So I waited for the mushroom gravy, even though I was hungry. When the mushrooom gravy arrived, I laughed after I tried it. This is just mushroom soup! Pretty ok mushroom soup, but by no stretch of the imagination is it a gravy!In the end, at the waiter's insistence I changed my order to the same as my wife's: Italian Steak & Fries. This was alrightish, nothing amazing, but my experience has already been ruined and my appetite reduced.The service:The staff are not well trained. Their service is a bit insistent and their manners a bit odd. For instance, my wife ordered a Merlot and I order a Chianti. When the wine arrived, the waiter to a sniff each, before announcing which it was. He handed my Chianti to me, and asked me if it was right. What? Did I say I was a wine expert? I don't know! I'm just ordering a wine based on the description to try it out. I did not ask to be in an impromptu wine identification contest!And the other waiter, when I mentioned that my mushroom gravy is just like mushroom soup, said haughtily: we don't have mushroom soup in our menu! So what? But it's still mushroom soup! The thickness is the consistency of soup, it tastes exactly like mushroom soup. So, just because there is no mushroom soup on the menu I have to accept this is mushroom gravy?Overall, I feel that Jamie Oliver has just lent his name for pure money making, without ensuring the food does justice to his celebrity reputation. In short, like a con-job: indifferent food and poor service, slapped with a celebrity brand on top to pass off as an Italian gourmet restaurant

Have had good to very good business lunches but average to poor family lunches as well ... guess it's not so family oriented.
4
Kids friendly environment, foods was good. Only thing we felt risotto was a little bit hard. Other than that was good to rate.
4
First time experience and had a wonderful time because food and atmosphere was great! We really enjoyed it
3
went with my girlfriend for late lunch.ordered 2 pastas which were very tasty.service is more concern on there phones or with is each other than taking care of the guest.wasnt busy.still i would give it a second chance.

Good food, good ambient, good service from serving staff who recommend us based on our dietary request

I took my family to Jamie's Italian for Mother's Day lunch. We had no reservations (I had to cancel a reservation I had made at La Braserrie at the Fullerton Bay Hotel because they raise their prices two-fold and I though that was daylight robbery. But that's another post). We found Jamie's packed. But the staff were very helpful and promised us a table in 30 minutes. We sat at the bar and ordered some drinks while we waited. The drinks were ok, nothing to write home about.And as promised we were led to a table within 30 minutes. We found the seats comfortable and the ambience lovely. My kid loved the little activity pouch that they gave her and it kept her occupied the better part of the meal. Her kid's meal was great. The portions generous. My prawn linguine was excellent although I wished I had ordered the bigger portion. Overall, the experience was terrific. I'd high;y recommend it
3
The restaurant has excellent ambiance, comfortable chairs, and very pleasant service staff. It is a great place to come together as a family (as we did) or a group of friends to have a enjoyable gathering. The restaurant is wheelchair accessible as one of our group was disabled and relatively good for a small baby in a stroller (although perhaps marginally on the loud side). Unfortunately, the food itself was rather mixed ranging from good to ordinary and poor. While clearly only the best ingredients are used, much of the food (and certainly most of the items that I personally ordered) itself lacked any special flavor and wow factor that would make me want to come back. The carbonate pasta was too dry (and frankly a bit too al dente for my liking), the pavlova too sickly sweet and the arrabiata lacking much beyond the chillies for character. The starter planks were acceptable but nothing to write home about. We enjoyed the spinach croquettes, the fungi neri pizza, and the pumpkin ravioli (which was genuinely unique!). All in all, it was a enjoyable evening with food that was slightly overpriced and not of the standard that I would expect from a big-name restaurant like Jamie's
4
Sure it's not cooked by Jamie Oliver himself but the food is nonetheless good. What I really like about is it serves real food to kids, not chicken nuggets. The fish bag consists of salmon, carrots, beans and broccoli. Okay my child didn't touch the veggies but it's okay. I'm just happy that I don't have to let her choose between chicken nuggets and hot dog for a change. The servers are friendly but sent wrong items to our table twice. Overall a good dinning experience.
1
I cannot recommend this place- I try to get a table that was not offered by the lady who is in charge. First of total arrogant employees. Give me the " eye" cause I want a different table. What is wrong with that. Change attitude and employees.Thank yo
5
It's one of the best place to enjoy the heavenly food with precious friends. It was an advance birthday celebration for me. We really enjoyed the evening. The food was so awesome and the service was fantastic. Thanks for the joyful birthday song. Highly recommended!!! Jamie's style is the best!!
3
Food was average, pork chop was too tough to either cut/chew. Nachos were soggy as well. However, the ambience was nice and staff were polite but there is more room for improvements on service.
4
Visit this place for a family member birthday celebration. The staff help us to suprise her with a special brownie with ice-cream, off course with birthday song. The lamb chop and pork chop is excellent. The garlic bread is yummy ( must have item )
5
Loved Jamie's! Second time I've been- last time was Adelaide Jamie's- loved it both times. Service was great, food was delicious and we enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. Great place for families and large groups too. Would definitely go back.
4
Lovely modern restaurant. The food as usual is very good and we just had a burger! Presented beautifully, makes you want to eat it. Very very busy place though, the staff are excellent at there job, no complaints at all.
4
We had dinner with friends at Jamie's Italian and found the service to be good. The food was also to everyone's satisfaction although the sides come in small portions.
5
We could not go past this restaurant as the name says it all. The food was great just what you would expect from an Oliver experience. The staff are just great and the kitchen staff are just fantastic to watch. The rest rooms are spotless. Please give this a go as just sitting in there and soaking up the atmosphere is worth the price. You won't be disappointed
4
Saturday afternoon, not so many people in the restaurant. Me and my husband able to find a table and enjoy our lunch. we order linguine with prawn, tomato base, this combination GOOD. And try also their salty ice-cream with chocolate Lava pudding, it will make your day
2
Well, I don't know what the whole fuss was about this restaurant and the fact that they are full. I find the menu offerings were a little tad small.Taste and flavor wise, it did not really WOW me a big let down. I had the steak and fries, the steak were well under seasoned and for SGD30 I think it is too overpriced for mediocre dish with just skinny fries and soggy coleslaw.The outdoor area we were sat at, were totally not friendly. No fan at all to take away the late afternoon heat. We were not able to enjoy the food served.I do not think I will ever patron this restaurant again neither would I recommend it to anyone I know
2
They had excellent service but the cripsy pork chop as recommended from this thread of review was way too salty. Our crab spaghetti was also loaded with salt:( We had the intention of ordering dessert but after drinking so much water, we just couldn't order our dessert. For $85, the food we ordered were flavourful but it's a shame that they're salty.The staffs were super polite & kept asking how was the food. My husband politely told them ok & good but I told my husband to help them improve. So when another service staff came around to enquire, we told them the truth & he said that he will inform the chef. I love Jamie's personality & I really wish him well
2
I was extremely excited to be going to Jamie's Italian at VivoCity Singapore and probably one of the reasons for the extreme sense of disappointment with the whole experience. On hindsight (and with a lot of struggle), I would say that the only good part was the welcome greetings that we received; everything beyond that wanted me to leave. We got a table even though we had not made a reservation but since it was a weekday we didn't expect this to be a problem. We ended up with 6 different people waiting our table and as one would expect, none knew what we had asked the other person to bring us. Our drinks got mixed up, we never go our bread basket even though we were told it would be chargeable (who charges for a bread basket in an Italian restaurant...Come on!!!), the food delivery was delayed, the pasta was dry and I actually ended up not finishing my portion. I was just happy to leave, never to go there again.(PS - don't waste your money on this pricey restaurant; its a let down to a great chef in Jamie Oliver
4
I see why this guy is famous. Everything was delicious. I know it is hard to mess up Italian but I enjoyed this place still. Some dishes are just so unique they are a must try.
2
The restaurant may be good for non-vegetarians but its a disappointment for vegetarians.
The Pasta and starters I had were pathetic.
I hope they include more vegetarian options in future.
3
Desserts are nice. Mains are so-so only. Service was a bit spotty. Heard the outlet at Forum is better. Might try that next time. Overall not a bad place to have your meals, just don't expect too much.
4
The garlic bread is simple but perfect. So soft and fresh and tasty. Pasta are great... Especially the crispy pork chop. ..love it bes
1
Which is no excuse. How can you not get the most basic of all -- bolognese spaghetti right? Pastamania does a better job at half the price
4
I went there to celebrate my son's birthday as he requested for Italian food. Called to make reservation in advance, request for good table with view. The restaurant atmosphere is simple. We didn't get a good view seat anyway.They gave my boy a very pleasant surprise.... a complimentary brownie dessert with ice cream in a nice presentation. Thanks.The truffle risotto is very nice. Definitely worth trying. The tiramisu is also nice but the presentation is not so goo
5
My family and I were visiting Singapore and we came to Vivo City to look for a restraunt. We found Jamie's Italian and decided to eat there. The food was fantastic! Everything was flavorful and delicious. I would highly recommend the garlic bread. It has great flavor with a nice taste. Also, our server named Joseph was very helpful and friendly. I love this place and I would definitely go bac
5
I came here for my birthday with my friends. We ordered quite a few dishes, and drinks, which all came very promptly. Staff was very attentive, no issues at all.
4
It's an Italian fusion international restaurant that they serve the best beloved Italian foods, such as pizza, spaghetti, and polenta - menu was varied and had something to suit everyone. Food was delicious, we had super food salad with salmon, pizza magaret, Cotoletta alla milanese(though they claimed that it wasn't cotoletta, they call it Milan style pan fried chicken) and their famous prown pasta. Quite too much for 3 people. Recommend to go there before 7pm for happy hour. Overall speaking it's an outstanding restaurant for mid-range spending in Singapore. Service was very good, staffs are friendly and cared about your opinion toward their foods
4
My sister and I visited this restaurant on the 8th April 2016. I had made an online reservation and informed them that it was my sister's birthday. They were super amazing and brought us a very well decorated slice of brownie and even crowded around us to sing her a birthday song.The food was really nice and we basically had a good time.
3
Love the appetizers but the pizza was not great...Too much garlic but the service is friendly and they extended happy hour! Nice
5
The dinner was to celebrate my birthday and the staff surprised me with a birthday dessert! Really appreciate it!
3
Me and boyfriend went here for italian lunch meal. I ordered pasta and it was fine however my boyfriend didn't enjoyed his steak since he was given super little sauce on top and the medium rare becomes well done.However the polenta appetiser was great. The service staff are not accommodating. They served us plain french fries but no sauce at all. We asked for mayonnaise and never comes.
1
The worst server I've ever seen.She started with introducing special menu but, I had to ask about that few more times and just gave up asking again. she just said spinach and cheese blah blah blah. She doesn't said that was ravioli. She threw everything like lucky-draw and bill and went back somewhere whenever I asked that. The table by my side had to wait too long and annoyed for ordering the dessert because of the server's chatting. I can't understand how this restaurant get the 10% service charge. My table was 3001 Hazel Something. The dishes were good
5
After walking through Vivo City looking for something to eat for dinner, my partner & I settled on Jamie's Italian and were we both glad for doing so.Upon arrival we were greeted at the door by a friendly waitress who advised that unfortunately there was a short 15min or so wait for tables, which is normal in Singapore, and so she took our names and gave us the options of walking through the shopping centre, or we could wait at the bar.Electing to wait at the bar, only 10min or so passed before we were offered a table. Our orders were then promptly taken and processed and a complimentary bottle of still water provided. My partner ordered Penne Bolognaise, which was not on the menu, but still made-up and I had the Tagliatelle Bolognaise - both dishes were served quickly and sumptuous, although at a cost of SG$100.00 for two bowls of spaghetti without private dining rooms I think is ridiculously expensive
3
Two years ago four of us enjoyed lunch at Jamie's, so on that basis our family of 11 had dinner there to celebrate two birthdays and the end of a wonderful family holiday. Unfortunately the food was disappointing. Some of the pasta was under-cooked, the sauces bland, and, after a mix-up with two children's dishes, their potatoes were stone-cold in the middle. Service was quite slow too. The cost of the children's food was removed after we complained, however, none of us is inclined to return to this over-rated restaurant. It was definitely an underwhelming experience
2
The bolognese was too salty and mushroom risotto tasted average. Both of these cost about 20+ each. Service always seemed in a rush but no one seemed to be in a hurry to check on us. We looked around for a while to get the waiter's attention, ordered, then waited some time for the food. The good part was the dishes came together.When the coffee came, the spoon was as tall as the cup, which didn't make sense. But no sugar was offered, so we had to try and get attention for it again.The view was nice but we were seated next to the highchairs, so they kept bumping into us.I had been here twice before and found it pleasant. But after this lacklustre experience, I am not sure I will return
1
After waiting for almost an hour for a table we expected the food to be more impressive! The menu was not very rich in options, the only tasty plates were the appetizers! The mushroom risotto was bad, rice almost raw so were the mushrooms, there was only one chicken platter which was also not tasty.The restaurant was super cold and the waiter seemed to be lost in space
2
I came here with high expectations. I was sorely disappointed. The menu showed none of the passion Jamie's renowned for. I ordered Crab spaghettini. It was bland and watery. The other dishes ordered were of similar quality. Service was not so good either. Specials weren't advised before we ordered. It wasn't until after we had made our minds up that we were told of some of the specials. But not all. Really, a terrible let down.
5
We had dinner there to celebrate the birthday of a close friend. The lady serving us very eloquently explained the menu offerings and gave us a number of helpful suggestions. As expected, the food was simply delightful and I really enjoyed my humongous burger and wine. They brought out a lovely birthday cake and cheered our "birthday boy" with great singing. In the end, all the people in our group said they had a great evening, and the overall bill came up to around $50 per pax, which I feel was money well spent. I would definitely go back again for a meal
3
Apple & lemon mohito are lovely
Sujest you to order Italian nachos.
My well done steak were burned
Bruschetta & rigatoni pasta was marvelous
4
Food is generally ok, but I like the environment more. Nice place to chill with friends and they have friendly staff too.
3
Wanting to taste some better food, I chose Jamie Oliver's a second time actually. I found the food very good at another restaurant but the service a bit odd, and gave this other location a chance as well. I nearly wished I didn't. Seems like they're aiming high with one waiter showing the table, another doing the candle light and napkin, a third filling my glass of water and a fourth taking the order. Getting a wifi code it is for 30 mins and everything after that is a bit rushed. It's as if they say: "This is not your office, eat up and get out of here". So a bit friendly, despite or perhaps because of the many people involved. Too much, rushed, with the food not being quite up there. The form distracted from the indulgence, for me
4
Just on the main street - you can drop by to Jamie's. Menu is not too long - but the dishes are very testy. Normally once you are in Singapore - you will go for other kind of food, but if you are too long in Far East - this is the place to visit to bring you back the good memories. Staff is friendly. The only remark - espresso - could be better, but this is just espresso - main course is very good. drop by and try it. Price range - "comfortable
5
Booking was very smooth; on arrival we met a warm and friendly team that welcomed us to our reserved seats. Ordering of the meal was both easy and entertaining; the food was, of course, excellent, needless to say. The team celebrated the birthday of one member of our group with a cake, and were very helpful to take several "we-fie" pictures of our group. The staff showed integrity by returning part of the bill caused by an error in data entry. In the end, the cost of the entire meal was reasonable, so we are happy to come back
5
My 10 yr old daughter celebrated her birthday at Jamie's Italian and I couldn't have been more pleased as to how it unfolded! For the first hour, the kids were led through a foccacia breadmaking session, pasta machine making demonstration, and an herbs lesson. Afterwards they were allowed to choose any main item from the kids' menu. Their chef-instructor had very good interactive skills and kept the kids interested. His instructions were clear and well paced, and he had an aide who helped go around the table to help those who didn't quite understand what to do. The step by step lesson was perfect for kids of that age who might get bored easily; this was very kinesthetic and fun for them. Later they were each able to bring home a tasty little foccacia "loaf" of their own. Overall, I thought the staff assigned to run the party did an excellent job. They smiled a lot, they were patient and clear and best of all, they appeared to care about the children's enjoyment. The food was also yummy. Thank you to all the staff

I went to Jamie's Italian last night with a group of friends on our way home from a spa day in Batam. We were relaxed, but hungry! The meal service was efficient, so it wasn't long before we had our food. Our servers were all fantastic. After reading the menu - I was planning to have the cannelloni 3 ways, but I saw the burger sitting on the pass to go out and I just had to have one. I think it was the best burger I have ever eaten. It was just a shame the chunky fries I ordered with it were soggy and limp. I was expecting them to be nice and crisp. If they had been right, then all would have been perfect. Fantastic that they were having happy hour and the server told us up front that we could order two wines at the happy hour price and he would hold one for us. Only $10 a glass and the wine serving was very generous. You don't find that in many places in Singapore. If you take a selfie and post it on Facebook and show the wait staff - you will get a free limoncello too
4
So, this is the Jamie's Italian Restaurant! We had ordered a pork chop, and a burger as our dinner. The pork chop is taste good but the big burger was not really good as we expected. Overall, the service is good, the food --- can be better thinking of the famous Jamie, the price is a bit pricey. Will I come again? Erm.. probably no
5
Great food with excellent service. Staff are attentive and service is fast. Nice ambience and we really enjoyed our dinner. Will definitely go back again
3
Just another place to grab something to eat.We had pizza and a burger, neither of those made any impression - can't place those even in top10 pizza/burgers we had.Food was somehow tasteless, not built well and the paper under the burger is something you are not suppose to eat. Eating was hard and pizza tasted only like garlic.No ketchup or any other mayos. Pretty big fail from a Jamie Olivers place..
5
Great food with good service and a lovely atmosphere. Great spot to catch up with friends overlooking Sentosa.
5
Great food, shrimp linguine and tiramisu were delicious.
There's currently a promotion where you get $25 off a min. spend of $100 by bringing along a printed voucher.
4
Never thought I would have a business lunch at Vivo City but glad I chose Jamie's Italian. Worked out well, got a quiet table, unobtrusive service, shared two appetisers and a main and finally, good value for money. Will recommend
5
The Food was outstanding, please be very hungry when you go, big portions. The service was fantastic.
4
Waiter was well versed in the menu and very efficient in making us well attended to. Had a birthday cake request and they put in creative effort to write the words on the board. Kudos to the diner team for surprising my date with the song. Enjoyed it very much. Will definitely go back there again
3
A nice place, service was good except when the delicated service staff seems tight-up, others seems not able to help at all.Snacks were on the salty side, ingredients (esp. the seafood) were fresh but overall taste was nothing to shout about.It probably won't be in favourite or frequent list...
3
Maybe we had too high expectations. They do a mean burger there, but the other dinners we tried were average to below average. The risotto was terrible, more like soup with rice that was still hard. Waiter never came back to check on us. My husband had pasta also very disappointing. We just paid and left. The night we both had burgers, the burgers were very good
5
My friend and I wanted a quiet dinner and chanced upon Jamie's Italian at Vivocity. The restaurant was spacious and we were served by Joseph. He was very knowledgeable of the food served, attentive and knew when to be at the table. We took his recommendations for the antipasta and mains, which were specials of the day. These turned out to be scrumptious recommendations. While ordering dessert, i shared with Joseph that it was my friend's my birthday. Joseph and the Jamie team surprised with a complimentary dessert. It was creatively presented and delicious. Thank you to Joseph and the entire team at Jamie's Italian Vivo City for making the birthday dinner especially memorable
4
Had lunch here whilst on holiday last week. We visit most times when we are in Singapore as we love the food which is consistently good. We got our bill and had to query the price as a Tiger Beer on the menu is $11 and the cashier was charging us $12 which is the price that was set in the cash register. This discrepancy certainly adds up when your group has several beers. The staff thanked us for bringing this to their attention. Makes you wonder how long people have been incorrectly charged??
2
This is my second time to the Vivocity outlet (my third time to Jamie's Italian, if you include the Forum outlet). The quality of service has improved over time, the staff made the effort to chat with the customers and they were very accommodating.However, the food is such a shame. Last time, I ordered the prawn linguine and it was so horrible, the size of the prawns were miniscule and the pasta was bland. I ordered the crab spaghettini this time, hoping for an improvement, but it was no better. The crab came in little bits and pieces, the pasta was beyond al dente and watery all at the same time. I tried my husband's fettucine bolognaise and it was only marginally better. We ordered the crispy squid twice. The first serving was decent but the second one was soggy. Crispy was certainly not the word to describe it.For the price, it was absolutely not worth it. I will not go back to Jamie's Italian at Vivo any more. Such a disappointment, considering I am such a Jamie Oliver fan
5
Waitress who waited our table was very nice, when the food arrived she came back to ask us how our meal was, and even brought a special cake for my mum as I was treating her to her birthday dinner!
4
went with a friend, ordered few dishes cant rmbr the name exactly. ordered pork chop if not mistaken, we love it. nice atmosphere, with nice view if you are sitting outside or facing the sea.
3
Food was ok. Fast. Good service. Room for improvement definitely. Is it worth the price? I Guess not... Too expensive for jus 3 pasta, a side and 3 drinks. Each person pays around $65...
4
Nice atmosphere and very friendly staff!
Food was good. The AC was to cold. Needed a jacket.
Would go there again!
4
Had like 3-4 bottles of wine n it was very nice nice food but the prawn linguine was pretty ordinary nothing special but the sirloin steak n the pink snapper is worth every penny that u spend!!! the mojito was quite a let down since it use white rum n one of it didnt had much rum taste to it... Awesome service from Kim,Dave and mel although mel was pretty nervous n spilt one wine glass overall it was really enjoyable being here for dinner. definitely will be bac

A Defining Dining ExperienceThe place is great. If you are looking to explore a sumptuous meal or seeking a place to celebrate an occasion, Jamie's place is a good choice.Great food, warm atmosphere from the service, rustic and intimate setting. the list checks out :)First, let's start with the food, since to most people, that's where the meat of the issue is.The food is Awesome, period. I can't do it justice in words here and have no doubt people are having issue pen-ing their wonderful experience down in words, you'll have to take my word for it and try it for yourself. If you're a foodie, or have followed jamie's or gennaro's cooking channel, or just someone who loves a full bodied robust meal bursting with flavor, check this place out if you haven't already been there many times too many to count. This place is not for the faint hearted fine diners kind of people, although there are some small portion starters and light salads, most of the menu are moderately sized, i would go further to say even slightly larger than the average restaurant portion. Each time i go i struggle deciding whether to try something new and exciting or just stick to my favorite mushroom and smoked cheese risottonext, ambience. The place carries a nice rustic setting with a great view of the harbour if you seat at the back. Starter platter served on a "plank" suspended on 2 italian cans of tomatoes, steak served on a cross section of tree trunk, you kind of get the image. Warm lights and warm people attending to you. I wouldn't call them servers or waiters, they feel more like warm friends although I haven't known them long, and eating with more friends in that atmosphere just relaxes you and helps you enjoy the food and experience more. A special shoutout to Dave and Jasher (hope i'm not putting pressure on you both) for their outstanding dedication, it's been a pleasure being tended to by you both. Thanks for the brilliant recommendation of the roast potato sidedish, phenomenal. And thanks for remembering us during our next visit and your kind gesture. not sure where to start with the menu? need recommendation for wine or food? no problem just approach anyone, they'll be more than willing to help.Lastly, Cost. I'm sure some would be concerned about this area. I would definitely say the price range isn't for everyone, especially if like me, you want to try everything as much as you can, a few starters, a main and some desert along with some good wine to go with each. However I feel you are paying for quality and as mentioned earlier, the portion is decent sized for what you are paying for. just save up a bit and go once and indulge, you'll be doing yourself a favor :
2
Very limited choice of pizzas. Choose a Rigatoni and it was tasteless. But with the different loads of tourists who visit Singapore, one gets away with this. probably no repeat visitors just incidental tourists popping in for a biteI cannot blame the restaurant for a incessibly loud crying baby. they lead me to a table next to it which I off course refuse
1
Nightmare . Starter Bruschetta priced at SGD 10 was a single small bread pc with some topping !! Complete rip off !! When asked about giving us some bread, it was told that you have to buy !! ever heard of buying bread in an Italian restaurant !! Half cooked Risotto came after 40 minutes of ordering . Complete disaster . Never again !!

We had a nice dinner at Jamie Oliver's Italian. The food was tasty, however we suspect they had a little timing issue in the kitchen as one plate (a steak) came out a couple of minutes earlier than the other plate and the steak was slightly cold, when served. It had probably been sitting in the kitchen waiting for the second dish to be ready... The setting and ambiance are very nice and we will certainly give this restaurant another try sometimes soon
2
We ordered for pomodoro and arrabiata pasta and it was not good especially paying for almost $20 for each dish. The price is on the high side. I know that Jamie Oliver is a famous Chef but there's nothing great with food that we ordere. The food price is pretty on the high side such as pork chop would cost around $38. And by the way, they don't serve pizza
4
Impromptu lunch visit - we could smelll the amazing aromas wafting out onto Clarke Quay. Friendly and knowledgeable wait staff helped us make amazingly great pasta choices. My ristto was truly delicious
4
Great truffle risotto - previously I've had the mushroom risotto which was rather salty. So I asked for no salt to be added. Truffle risotto was a winner !
4
Great services. The salmon was really good and the latte was especially smooth. The group had a great time
4
I went to Jamie's with a customer who works nearby. Service was good-excellent by Singapore service standards. Lamb, Caesars salad and pasta main courses all good. View is nice if you book window table ahead. I will go again with friends. nice job.
2
Wasn't bad bad .... But you shouldnt expect "wasn't bad" from Jamie's Kitchen should you. Like the juice and smoothies though
3
This is the second time of visiting this restaurant the first being in 2013 and then this month. I know I am not a great lover of pasta and pizza etc, but I would have expected the other choices on the menu to be of a hight standard considering Jamie Oliver is supposed to be a quality chef and therefore would only employ good quality chefs.We both had the chicken and mushroom dish this time. The mushrooms and sauce where served on a dry slice of bread which soaked up all the sauce, the chicken was tough and dry. It is very overpriced for what you get and do not want to go back for a third visit
2
Been to Jamie's for 3 years straight (thus the title)Reason why we still visit was that it's where we went on our first date! So I decided to go again and went on Vday last Sunday (14/02/16).. Ordered pastas as its V day n the menu was limited. Pasta was over cooked... The carbonara sauce was overly salty. The bolognese was bland. The dip for their calamari was overly salty as well.. Their for "famous" polenta chips (I have never tried it before so I do not really know how it should taste like) but I personally feel its tasteless, even when it's fried/Tossed in Parmesan n Rosemary.. Both of us barely touched it after the first bite. But Service was good as usual though that's the plus point. Conclusion: not worth going on special occasions (limited menu). Sightly overpriced (if the food was good I'm willing to pay, but this wasn't worth it). Both of us decide that was the last time we will visit J.O again..

I love italian and this resturant has to be my favourite!! The restaurant itself is great, the service was awesome and the food to die for. Definitely have to try the prawn linguine, its famous for a reason. Great location to go to after a day at sentosa or if staying on the island easy to get to via the monorail or walk the boardwalk to the shops! Thank god they have one in Perth.
4
My wife and I had a great time! Food was wonderful, and definitely refreshing to see that there is good service in Singapore!
5
Lovely restaurant..good food.. Good crews.. Me and the wife enjoyed it lot. Will go again next time
4
The food is quite nice and service is good also. There is an outdoor zone which you can seat and enjoy harbour view. And you can ask for free wifi here
5
Seated by the harbour front windows, so this restaurant never felt like a shopping mall diner. Attentive staff (esp. Dave), tasty food, good deal on wine before 7 pm, all made for a very enjoyable early evening dinner.
5
It was a great one, food recommendation were right on. Enjoyed it so much. Will definitely go back with my friends.
5
staff was very helpful, allowed me to choose our table next to the river with lots of room. Staff was prompt and helpful. Food ingredients were of high quality.
5
This restaurant is just great, the service is fantastic, the food is superb, kids' menu is really nice. We really enjoyed ourselves thanks to the excellent service and food!
5
My wife and i had a dinner at jamies italian in vivo city the food was superb and taste really good. Thanks to Chef Alesandro for a good recommendation and for taking care of us! One of the best Italian restaurant in singapore! Definitely will come back! Kudos to Chef Alesandro and the team! Keep it up! Fly high! Cheers
3
I was so excited about the restaurant's opening, I made sure I visits the restaurant within a month of it's opening! End up I was quite disappointed by the food quality. The fish we ordered was overcooked. The pasta we ordered was a tad too sour and the lighting was way too dim to se what we were eating…
2
Totally overrated restaurant !The food was OK (nothing great as we expected) but the cocktails were a disaster. Wouldn't recommend anybody to go there
5
Awesome! Friendly and accomodating staff! Remembered my request to remove one chair to slot in the stroller. Great healthy food and wonderful ambience! One small tip is for staff to get back to the customer after he/she has made a special request food-wise. Otherwise, the customer would not know whether the request is ok or we need to order something else etc. But overall, the service was excellen
4
The location of the restaurant is ideal and we sat outside to take in the views. When the waiter arrived with the menu I was initially surprised at the limited choice, as I had expected more. However, once the waiter explained the days 'specials' I chose the Spinach Croquettes as I wasn't particularly hungry. I was pleasantly surprised as although they weren't exactly spectacular looking on the platter, they were really lovely and the small amount of sauce they were placed on exactly the right amount. For dessert we shared a tiramisu which was to die for, with plenty of alcohol and was melting in the mouth. I had a glass of wine as it was happy hour when we arrived and again it went well with the dish I chose. Overall we enjoyed the evening, although my daughter did ask for a frozen Martguerita which was one the wine list, but was told that they didn't do the frozen ones, minor upset but overall I was impressed with the service, price and quality of the food
5
Great service and food. The staff are always friendly and helpful and knowledgeable when it comes to GF foods.
4
Popular restaurant in an excellent location. Good size servings and friendly service.
A little noisy inside but worth a visit.
3
This is a busy and popular restaurant providing good but fairly average food and better than expected. Service was on the slow side but the wait staff were friendly and attentive. A good place for a casual lunch at reasonable prices.
4
We really enjoyed our time at Jamie's Italian - Vivocity.
Staff are bright and cheerful and food & drinks were very enjoyable.
4
This is the 1st time we tried Jamie's Italian and we were not disappointed. Service and food was excellent.
5
We went there a few weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed the food and service experience. I would want to highlight Ms. Catherine's service as truly awesome. She was attentive, funny and did everything to make us feel comfortable. When our kids felt cold, she even brought over a blanket. Will definitely go back again
2
The ambience had more in common with a fast-food restaurant, the service was spotty and the food magnificently mediocre. Despite all they charged fine dining prices! My pasta dish had more in common with Kraft Dinner than good Italian food. Despite our disappointment the place was full, and many customers seemed satisfied - but my wife and I will never go back
3
I've eaten in a number of different Jamie's in the UK many times (the ones in Reading and Covent Garden in particular) but the food at this one in Singapore was not up to the same standards I felt. The food was OK, but it lacked something in taste and quality in comparison. We had a Caesar salad and 3 times cannelloni, and both were disappointing and lacking in the flavours we are used to from a Jamie's restaurant. The cannelloni pasta was tough and overcooked for example, while the Caesar salad barely had any sauce on it.The restaurant is lively and has a nice décor and the staff were all friendly and helpful. On the downside, when we arrived (around 7pm), we were told we would have to wait 45 minutes for a table, even though we could see many tables free. We were told that the free tables we could see were reserved. We decided not to wait and instead were able to sit and eat at the bar, from where we were also able to see that the "reserved" tables remained free for the next hour or so which was a bit frustrating
2
We had the fish board and a crab pasta. Honestly, there is nothing much to rave about the food. Average is the best word to describe it, flavours were overly simple for the pricing. More liberal use of herbs would definitely be recommended.Service was plain dismal. The waiters were zoned such that available waiters in different zones were not allowed to attend to guests in zones where the waiters were busy. The "seater" said she was not in charged of taking orders when asked, she reluctantly did so. When she passed on our orders to our waiter, she got 3 of 5 items wrong. Thankfully the waiter confirmed our orders before placing it to the kitchen. It was hard to get the service staff attention during the meal, cheese was not served with the pasta automatically. We had to wave frantically for 5 minutes before we can get our bill. If we had walked out without paying, not one of the service staff would have known.Boo to the service staff, your customers deserve your attention
3
Jamie's prides itself on its kids menu. I would say all the extra crayons and activities for the kids were very much welcome. However, the food itself was disappointing. Ordered the chicken lollipops - the chicken pieces on satay sticks were dry and hard. Plainly grilled. Came with 2 steamed potatoes - plain as well. My kid didn't touch much of it at all. My son had some kind of fish and again lots of potatoes in a tomato sauce base - the fish was didn't smell good and again too much potatoes. Perhaps some pictures would have been helpful in the selection. I think the mini burgers from the next table would have fitted my children better. For the adults we had lamp chops - they were kind of microscopic with very little meat. Came with a few side dishes and you guessed it - more potatoes. The wooden platter looked really empty with so little on it. This dish was one of the most expensive on the menu.
4
A lovely meal out!
There is enough choice on the menu to please the whole family.
The place itself is nicely decorated and the waiters are top.
The food was very good and priced fine.
4
Ate here after being given reassurances that simple gluten free options were available. Pasta dishes (one was gluten free) were very well cooked and surprisingly tasty. Pricing was fair and we were well looked after by 'Apollo'. We will happily return here.
4
Great place for an authentic Italian dinner. Would love to visit again definitely :) prices a bit high but I would say it's worth it
2
We were time when it was busy time, so waited the table - it was ok. menu looked so good that it taked time to choose - waiters were busy and we felt the pressure while looking the menu.ARTISAN BREAD BASKETa good selection of breads with Olive tapenade. This needs also butter with seasalt.ITALIAN NACHOSGood, only 9 nachosOUR FAMOUS PRAWN LINGUINEBeautiful portion. Tomatosauce tasted too mild / no cooked / straight from tincan. No cheese with the pasta :( pasta tasted good and was al dente!(MEATBALLPIZZA WITH JALAPENO)HOTHOT!! Crispy bottom. Right amount of cheese and other toppingsRASBERRY PAVLOVAgood, not too sweetDrinks: mojito was ok, banana-almond smoothie too watery and only about 200ml.Waiters were busy, we had to call them and wait every time, they didn't asked is all ok, waited the bill too long (then no busy time) and waiters only covered other tables and polished cutlery... We had to ask frequently more water, waiters didn't filled glasses. And I think that the place like Jamie Olivers, waiters tells more about the food, the restaurant and opinions from food. Our bill was about 130sg$, so it is overpriced from average food and poor service
3
Food was only average. Pasta didn't taste like it was freshly handmade. Appetizers were better than mains. Rather disappointe
5
Was there to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and it was a great experience. The service was excellent and they gave us epic brownie as complimentary birthday cake which is a nice gesture.We had CAULIFLOWER FRITTI - highly recommended as the taste and texture is really good. OUR FAMOUS POLENTA CHIPS - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, though might be slightly bland.GRILLED PORK CHOP - really well done and flavorful, though might be slightly undercooked to my liking at certain parts. CRAB SPAGHETTINI - not too bad and good value for the price.REFRESHER - must try as it's really refreshingBERRY BLAST - very fruity and tastes really goodEPIC BROWNIE - taste really good, especially when it's moist and warm on the inside of the brownie with chocolate oozing out.SORBETS - decent quality but nothing special.
4
We booked a table for 12 people. 6 adults. 6 children. Staff were friendly, attentive and went out of their way to ensure we had a positive dining experience. Food was fresh, healthy and delicious. Highly recommend the pasta and grain salad. A great family restaurant.
1
Our meal was ok, would not go again.You pay for the name. Very disappointed every thing is over priced for what you get
5
This restaurant was extremely busy but we managed to get a table but would recommend that you book before going. The food was very fresh and my husband said that his burger was the best he had ever eaten. I had mushroom risotto which was very tasty. I ordered ice cream to finish with a choice of honeycomb ice cream with fresh fruit and extra honeycomb, unfortunately (maybe due to translation) mine arrived with chocolate chip ice cream and no honey comb. As chocolate chip is a flavour I don't eat I had to send it back with the request that I have vanilla ice cream with the 2 toppings, when it came back it was fine. The staff were very attentive and we didn't find the menu overly expensive but good value for money
3
My company booked several tables for dinner here. We were limited to a smoked ham selection starter, a choice of mains (rump steak, chicken or crab spaghetti) and tiramisu dessert.My rump steak was nicely cooked - seasoning is alright and there is a nice burnt crisp at the corners of the steak. However, it was just a well cooked steak and nothing more to rave about. Even my colleagues gave the same comment.Tiramisu is very moist with the alcohol - a tad too much that it overpowered any coffee/chocolate taste. My colleague wasn't pleased with the spaghetti - he said it tasted nice but he can't 'find' any crab meat at all.Overall, I think it's best not to come in expecting to be wowed with extremely fine dining food. Just come in expecting a decent nice meal and you should be fine. Then again, I understand the prices are steep. So that might sway your ratings if you are expecting a decent nice meal at a decent 'standard' price.Service though is good. Most of the staff were very attentive to our requests
4
Food was good and service from the wait staff was great! Special mention to Dave who made a special arrangement to surprise my father with a small dessert and Happy Birthday singalong.
3
Avoid the dining area next to the kitchen at the VivoCity restaurant - we found it hot and very noisy
4
Easy to book a table online plus no hassle to add pax to it. Totally enjoyed my experience with Jamie's Italian.
5
Grilled pork for main course is superbly done and well marinated in right portion.
Pasta and bread spread are commendable.
3
We were so excited about spending an evening at Jaime's place because we have always been a fan of his.The selection of appetizers were mostly deep fried. We loved the olives, but the calamari were under cook and chewy, the coating were soft. The fried revioli were doughy.Both the steak and the chicken are very tasty and well prepared. But both of our pasta dishes were not el dente (squid ink and tagliatelle). The Cabonara tasted like white sauce instead of egg.The staff are not well trained, make ordering very frustrated and dishes came out at different order and main dish not together, guests have to wait for a long time for the others to be serve.We were all very disappointed.Janet Tan
5
This Jamies Italian is better than the one in Brisbane and that one is exceptional. This Jamies Italian has a really lovely decor. It manages to feel like you are eating at home which is lovely. The food was as you would expect - really good. The standouts for me were the black olive tapenade , freshly made breads, arrabbiatta, panna cotta , berry blast cocktail and latte. Absolutely no complaints. The staff were friendly and efficient. A memorable night and a place I could recommend. Cost for 5 adults eating, starter, mains, dessert, coffee and alcohol just $354 - wow
3
Service staffs were awesome in communications and recommendations. The restaurant manager even cleared the dishes and came back to wipe clean our table so that we could enjoy a cleaner space for drinks.However quality of food could have been better with the restaurant's renowed reputation.
3
We met a few friends at Jamie's Italian, expecting the usual standards by JO. The evening started well with nice drinks and a pleasant water view of the sea container cranes. Generally it didn't feel like a JO's restaurant. There was a certain magic/soul missing from the ambience. The baked mushrooms was v.small compared to Bathe and Sydney, Canberra and HK restaurants. I had the black truffle Risotto and it was unfortunately not well seasoned and the truffle oil was missing with limited truffle flavour. I can't comment on other friends dishes but we all felt a little disappointed. My wife commented the crab spaghetti pasta was flavourless and had no soul in the cooking.Overall, it was a nice night and good company. The restaurant wasn't overly loud and a good place to catch up and chat
2
We really had expected a little better despite the countless bad reviews online but it really was disappointing. None of us enjoyed our food.
4
We stumbled into Jamie's whilst walking along the foreshore. Decided we could all (8 off us) find something on the menu. The meal was great, had a nice bottle of NZ Sauvignon Blanc and a great experience sitting at a round table with 6 children and teenagers. I had the whole snapper and my my partner had a massive burger. We all had a good time and enjoyed the service.
4
The service is v good they have kids menu
The food is v good and price is in average
The staff are very , its near Sentosa island
5
Honestly, it was disappoining on my 1st visit. Am glad i went back again to give it another shot. Yummy food n big portion
5
Everything was great except for the noise from kitchen staff throwing the utensils around was simply deafening.
5
Great food, service a little hit and miss but it was a busy night. Very family friendly and a lovely atmosphere, would go back again.
5
Ambience was good and great service from the crew. Main courses were pretty alright and the dessert was delicious, however it's rather pricey though.
4
First time trying Jamie's Italian at VivoCity. Had a birthday celebration. Some hits and misses. Friendly staff creates a nice atmosphere. Desserts are good.
5
Very nice place and staffs were friendly. Serves really good pasta and their nachos was surprisingly good!

Coming from UK and familiar with good reputation of Jamie Oliver we decided treat in this restaurant. We sat outside and waited for someone to serve us but could not see any staff. We helped ourselves to the menus. Finally the manager came to take our order. We gave the order for starter, main course and wine. The wine and starter arrived and as expected the quality and taste of food lived to its reputation. No sign of main course until one of the young waiters came to ask if everything was ok so we told him that we were waiting for the main course. He came back with his order pad and asked if we could give him the order as it did seem to be with the kitchen. So, we placed the order again. When the dish arrived, we liked the presentation and the taste, as expected. It was a shame that whilst Jamie Oliver franchises his name and tasty recipes internationally,his reputation goes down the drain with poor service by the franchisers.
1
With all the amazing food you can find in Singapore this is a terrible place to good. We tried several dishes but none was acceptabl
5
i usually have their super duper rump steak..was a little disappointed tt tis was not available as they crafted a special xmas eve menu..i had the risotto and it was soo yummilicious!! it was my cousin's 1st visit and she loved the chicken dish & enjoyed her xmas eve lunch..i'd like to thank the lovely lady server who was very patient with us as we took some time to digest the recommendations by her.. as my mind was only filled with the rump steak ha ha.....my cousin and i certainly had a wonderful xmas eve at Jamie's...with wonderful staff and tho a little noisy due to a big group near our table, it was ok as our attention were just on the risotto and chicken..and it's Christmas !
4
The Xmas set starters and mains were sumptuous! Desserts were either too sweet or too sour. Definitely has room for improvement.
4
Good food and atmosphere, great for gathering because the venue is big and spacious! Their baked mushroom is a must order dish!
3
Service was good, friendly waitress, even sat beside me to get our orders! =) and great atmosphere. Food was ok, nothing extraordinary. Truffle Risotto quite good.
5
Great food. But Hubby said it will be better if there is some chilli sauce.
The desert slightly too sweet. If it could be a little less sweet would be nice.
Overall the food is great. Will look forward to next visit.
4
Good food and lovely relaxed ambience! The arabiatta sauce is very good and we got a take away as well! Thanks to the lovel kim! Recommended for a relaxed weekend lunch
5
The overall atmosphere and food wwe're really great. And the service there was good too. The price is surprisingly average and it's not as much as I thought. Would love to come back again!
5
We celebrated a friend bday and we had the best time, we were a table of 11 including 5 kids. We all had a roaring time. Right from the lovely lady who seated us to the gentlemen who made sure our Food was served well Mr. Nats and Mr. Seldron. Thank you guys for a wonderful time and looking after us. Regard Deepa
5
I took longer than expected to visit the restaurant as I heard the food was just ok. But I still believe that I have to try it myself. The food I say is awesome the service is fantastic. And I requested for a birthday cake and it was done without question. Overall we love the experience
3
Had a family pre Christmas lunch. Went for the Christmas special. Nice platter for entree. Main meal was the veal... supposedly the special menu but was rather tasteless...a bit disappointing for selected special. Meat was overdone the first time round. Dessert was good though with the small samples. Service was average. Our time was outside the peak period but attention given was somewhat mediocre..
4
Another appetizing night spent at Jamie's Vivo city. This outlet compared to the newer one at Forum is more entertaining in my opinion as the layout and people oomphs out a comfortable and enjoyable ambience. People watching is great here too.. But the best for me is that I am severeved by best wait staff. Jason is top of my list and I Listen to his recommendations and his attentiveness to little details does bring me back. He may have forgotten my name but definetely not my face. Last evening he introduced me to another colleague who is equally attentive and sorry Jason prettier too !!! Wow how not to go back to Jamie's at Vivo !!! John chin
5
Staffs are friendly and active. Food are delicious with a little bit small in portion. Even better if you book table beside the harbourfront to enjoy the atmosphere.
5
Having dinner with family and all first time @ Jamie's Italian. All loved the food and the serving staff was excellence.👍
5
Get the pastas - you will not go wrong! Ever.. Risotto was excellent ambience was nice for a casual dining experience and reasonable price..
5
Came here last November and ate lunch before my flight back home. I try Prawn linguine and panna cotta. I really enjoyed the food and the place.Kuddos to the Jamie's Italian Team! Specially to Hazel who helped me to choose my food.
2
I visited you guys last Saturday it was raining cats and dogs and only one couple was sitting outside under the roof cover. I asked the waitress if I could sit down with our very well behaved Shetland Sheepdog. The waiter said: "Not allowed sorry we have no dog permit". What on earth is a dog permit? Other restaurants on the same stretch allow dogs and they have never heard of such a thing as a dog permit for restaurants. Pull yourself together guys, show that you have both brains and heart
4
This was our first visit to a Jamie’s Italian restaurant. It was a mid-week and lunch time. We were quick to be seated and orders taken, food arrived soon after ordering, meal sizes were average but tasty, we both ordered the risotto which was tasty, we also had a side dish; funky chips, the garlic was a bit overpowering. We found the staff to be courteous and attentive, overall is was a good experience
1
Restaurant has strong cooking smell that sticks to your clothes. Also has house flies. Food wasn't great but was very expensive.
4
On our recent visit to Singapore we had lunch at Jamies. The service was warm and friendly and we were attended to quickly. The meals were well cooked and quite substantial. However I found the chilli a little overpowering, nevertheless the waitress did say that next time I could ask for less chilli, maybe for western people, in future, they could ask whether they like their meals hot or less spicy, just a thought. Would go back again
1
all i can say is, don't come here with high hopes if you expect its jamie's italian. All you can expect is, pasta. I had a crab spaghettini, and I'm not quite sure what to make of it, in fact I left feeling sick because the pasta had a wierd raw texture and it was very soupy, not something that I've tasted in italian food before, for what I was ordering.
2
We ordered 3 Christmas sets, the appetizers were the best among the three courses, and the desserts were really disasters, way too sweet!!! I felt I was eating white sugar. We were overcharged for the prosecco which was supposed to be complementary in the Xmas set.
4
Love the ambience and food. Especially my squid ink pasta. My toddler love her spaghetti meatballs too 😄
2
Menu is limited. Nothing special about the food. It was my wife's birthday so they gave a complimentary brownie which was nice.
4
Staff can be considered quick. definitely friendly.
Food wise, I was looking at al dente pasta but it was a little undercooked instead.
Polenta fries was meh...
Price is on the expensive side.
2
Food Portion is tiny and food is far from Jamies real cooking skills. Ambience is good. Food is blend unlike jamies cooking with big doeses of flavors like salt
3
As a European I have been experienced many variants of the dishes that we had. The quality of the pasta was very disappointing, more so given that the restaurant is associated with such an esteemed chef. Nonetheless to be fair the service was excellent.
3
Was surfing thru the VivoCity mall in search of place for lunch and suddenly saw familiar name of Jamie's. My wife is a fun of Jamie Oliver and we were visiting his fancy reastaurants in London and St.Petersburg. So I've decided that ifood here should be a bit expensive but tasty and of good quality. That's why I went in. The menue had not much choice, few basic Italian appetizers , few salads, pasta, 5-6 main dishes. The whole menue took one sheet of A4-format paper...Having not much choice I've ordered risotto with truffle ( as it was named in menue). When they've brought it I ' ve been shocked....truffles was presented by 4 smaaaaaaaalllllll pieces like 4 brown colored spangles ... And... That was it! Finally I've paid 40+ sgd basically for rice-porridge ... Can you imagine my feelings?
3
The vibes were good, so were the service. But, the restaurant was quite noisy perhaps because the sounds reverberated due to the glass and we had to raise our voices just to be heard. Food was decent but pales in comparison to other more traditional Italian restaurants joints here and there are quite plenty. And it was a tad pricey. I think people who likes it comes for the brand and the vibes, rather than the food.
4
We had a fantastic lunch here, the prawn linguine is delicious. We both had pasta and a side salad with two glasses of wine. Service was friendly the atmosphere fantastic and portion size was enough for lunch but might need to be bigger for dinnertime. Over all the experience was fabulous and I would highly recommend trying the linguine

My 8 year old daughter saw this place in Vivo city and, because she recognised it from home, chose it for her birthday meal. Great quality food, great value for money - no where near as expensive as tje ones in England. The food was delicious and varied and the service superb. They even did a special birthday cake for the birthday girl
4
Its my second time at Jamie's and since then the menu has changed (better now, since there are more vegetarian options). Very good food, really nice service and great overall atmosphere to compliment a Friday night :)
3
Service was pretty good. But for the amount that I paid, I can get much better Italian food at other restaurants.
5
The Service staff, Nani is friendly n provide very good advise on all food in the menu n deliver good service. I will be back..
4
Brought me over to the best table with a view after finding out that I was having a meal with my ex-boss. That help seal the deal for a new job offer!
3
The place was nicely decorated with cozy corners with outdoor seatings, giving the place a subtle charm. Good for gatherings and couples. Took the Christmas menu, food is average, with desserts a bit too sweet and over-portioned. Service was average and was not asked how i wanted my meat done. A bit too hard sell on the Christmas menu and should focus on promoting the best sellers/chef's recommendations instead for first timers.
3
This was my 2nd visit and i have ordered the skinny fries for my friends as recommanded however it turned out to be quite hard.i believed it had been deep fried for longer than it should be.We orderedthe squid ink pasta and it was quite salty.It will not be my option anymore.my friend orderedthe chicken breast from the kids's menu and her son did not want to eat as the underside of the meat with the sesame seeds was burnt and that was a charred taste to it.it was very disappointing
4
Food was great as expected. Very happy with it as well as the service. Had eaten here before and I'm not sure if it's just a psychological thing or not, but it seems (I may be wrong), like their portioning of food has increased, making it more value for money. The only down side that I would say is that the alfresco area is quite warm/hot. The outdoor fans didn't really cover the area where we were seated. So would be great if that could be addressed. But other than that, really happy with everything else

Have dined at Jamie's Italian many times and have always enjoyed the food, service and ambiance.Trying to decide what to choose this night and I originally was considering the 30-DAY MATURED PRIME SIRLOIN 280g chargrilled steak cooked to your liking & served with wild mushrooms, peppery endives & funky chips.Fortunately i changed my mind at the last moment and chose the crab spaghetti which was lovely.However my partner ordered the sirloin steak med/rare. When it arrived it was cooked to the right scale, maybe slightly more med than rare. However it was very tough. It was advertised with fresh cooked mushrooms and chips, however the small serving of mushrooms was a disappointment. At $46 one would expect a nice medallion of succulent juicy steak smothered in mushrooms. Instead the cut was a flat slice of meat about 2cm thick and i have my doubts that it was the 280gm advertised.It looked more like the 220gm rump steak also on the menu at $29.50.Doesn't mean we wont dine here again, just will give the steaks a miss. If you want good steaks in Singapore i suggest Prime Society or Cut, but that's another review

It was very nice to find a good quality dining experience while we were out on a Sunday afternoon shopping experience. Food was well presented but not pretentious, atmosphere was lively and the service well trained. Would like to have had a little more variety to the menu

Location is good, in vivacity harbour front, on the water with a lovely terrace - particularly lovely at night (recommend having drinks, crispy squid and the antipasta while watching the lights on the water in the evening). This visit we were there as a family on Saturday midday and sat indoors. The acoustics are a bit loud (high industrial ceilings) in the part of the restaurant nearer the water, and the airco was very draughty there (in the end we changed tables). In the back of the restaurant nearer the shops the ambience is cosier, but also darker.Menu was good, with delicious daily specials and at the moment a Seasonal 3 course menu including a glass of prosecco for sgd79.50.We ate a la carte - crispy squid (our favourite) and the good food salad to start (lovely fresh power food ingredients, broccoli, brown rice, avocado etc. if you don't like hot spice then ask for the Harissa on the side but do add it as you are eating as it really peps it up!). We then had crab spaghettini (a generous portion, taste ok but not out of this world, capers made it rather sour without the compensation of enough warmth from the chilli) and the daily special (rustic rotolo- delicious, sweet pumpkin, creamy ricotta and spinach in pasta roll). Kids are well catered for at Jamie's. As you would expect from the man who campaigned to improve the quality of Britain's school dinners, at Jamie's the ingredients of the kids food are the same very high quality that you get in the adult menu, just simpler with less unusual flavours. Pasta tomato bake was excellent (kids can also sometimes see the pasta being made near the front of the restaurant), and kids burgers were also excellent quality. We were hoping our kids could leave some for us to finish up but no such luck, clean plates all round! They also bring a little jar of salad with a dressing and the instructions 'Shake me' which was was fun and interactive way of getting the kids to eat salad - it worked! Kids were provided with a little pack of games, activities, crayons etc. which worked really well.Service was friendly and seemed well informed about the food. There was a mix up with one of our orders so we ended up eating a little out of sync, which was a shame - and which would put me off bringing business visitors here.The cold air from the airco put us off lingering for a coffee and dessert, which was a shame as they looked excellent. We will be back though.... Please keep working on improving this, and the service consistency

Fabulous earthy food and a very child friendly environment. I just wish the staff was more engaging.
3
Nice restaurant with an exciting menu, but when we got the bill we were stunned to be charged S$11++ for a bottle of water. Okay it was a litre bottle and sparkling but unbranded and simply extortionate. Not doing that again, please be warned.
1
My reservation was cancelled by the restaurant without our prior notification to us. We nearly could not have a seat in the restaurant. Ruined our dinner mood especially we were there to celebrate birthda
4
However, service can be more organized and improved. Staff brought food that we didn't order and they placed the wrong order for our drinks.   
2
Have booked a table to celebrate my partner birthday however when we reached there it was given a center table. But we request to get a better view table since it was so many empty table. At the end it was put up at corner but no view at all. Back to the food, it terrible on the carbonara pasta. It's too salty. We spent less than 45 mins in the restaurant includes ordering, waiting time and check out.

I have eaten at Jamies Singapore a few times as we have customers nearby. Layout is fantastic right on the waterfront with a really nice fit out and a great looking restaurant food (when you get it) is great.Tables are good and comfy... which is good as after being seated you are left alone for quite some time.Our waitress was miserable and obviously didn't want to be there, after we were seated she went off and was chatting with another staff member leaving us on our own, she took our order and then disappeared again, we only saw her one more time.Our order of olives (which by the way are awesome) was forgotten until I reminded the manger and our drinks took 3 goes to get right.We eventually got the manager (who was great) and things improved but I am going to have to consider taking my customers elsewhere in future, a shame as the service lets down a hardworking and excellent kitchen and great food from a strong UK based brand.I know its really hard to get good waiting staff in Singapore and I feel sorry for the owners but at these prices people expect better..Hopefully with some staff training things will improve
4
Ordered rump steak as suggested by one fellow here and its really good. Ordered the steak to be medium.For the truffle risotto, the truffle taste is not strong and the blue cheese is too overpowering. So make sure you dont stir in all the blue cheese first. Everyone has different tastebud
3
We have dined here 4 times. What's good really depends on what you order. Most pastas are good and so are salads and starters but other items may be inconsistent. Great for kids - they bring the kids a bucket of crayons and a little folder containing puzzles. Good kids' menu. Service can be short during busy periods and once at about 11am when the place was about 30% filled - could have been due to the service turnover from breakfast to lunch but that shouldn't be an excuse
4
Went with a few friends and had the power salad I think it was, which was quite nice, although a little more color would have suited the dish. All the food around us looked quite nice and well presented. Quite like the atmosphere and it was easy to get a table for 4 without a prior reservation (on a week night) the restaurant did fill up though. Super service, the staff was very tentative and well informed about specials. Would come back with my family as well, seems there is something for everyone on the menu
1
Rude waiting staff when we walked in, didn't receive a few things we ordered.. however waiter was polite and helped with our requests.
5
The crews were amazing. Serving at the right time, friendly, helpful and also very kind. They also took the extra mile to fulfil my request. Was really amazed when they call me back to follow up on my reservation.
2
The food isn't that good after they changed the menu. No more carbonara truffle pastas and truffle fries!
4
I had the penne pomodoro! The dish was great, the restaurant was full and the ambience was lovely. I loved the experience and think Jamie's a must go for a nice meal! The panna cotta was fantastic :)
5
Amazing.
The one place in Singapore where we got treated with the upmost respect and didn't get treated like second class.
Which is a big deal I think in Singapore.
Food was great.
Service was great.
Price was great.
Location was great.
5
I have heard alot of feedbacks regarding the food they serve. some are good and other said otherwise.. but the food we ordered was fantastic!
Will visit again. Thanks!
3
Great staff - courteous and very attentive despite the evening dinner crowd. My crab spaghetti was flavourful, though I felt the spaghetti could have been a little more al dente. Generally, enjoyed the atmosphere and energy of the place.

Good food great service ! Certainly worth another visit and recommendation to friends and colleagues

I visited Jamie's Italian Restaurant while stopping over in Singapore and was hoping to get some really tasty food. The staff were very welcoming and accommodating when I first arrived and I got a table very quickly.I ordered a drink first so I could look over the menu to see what I fancied. I ordered the 30-Day Matured Prime Sirloin and asked for it to be medium to well done. When it arrived it was bloody as hell. I explained to the staff that I cannot eat anything that raw as I am taking medication that reduces my immune system post transplant and it would be dangerous for me to consume. The staff were great and very understanding but then it came back within a few minutes and it wasn't much better. The chips that came with the steak were not even reheated. I showed the staff how red and uncooked the sirloin still was and they asked if I wanted them to take it back but it was pointless. Chef's don't like being told to redo something which showed in the way and how quick my sirloin was returned. I don't normally have steak since my transplant as chefs don't like to do them well done or even just cooked. Back in Australia I've had so much hassle when ordering a steak due to this but then someone told me the best thing to do is ask for it to be medium to well done and it should come back cooked. So this is what I tried to do in Jamie's.In the past when I've asked for well done, it usually takes an hour for it to come which is not fair on those dining with me but on one occasion the chef came out and asked if he could butterfly the steak which means slice it in half so it cooks quicker. It was the best steak I've ever had.Surely when you go out to a restaurant and order a steak, it should be done how you like it or even how it has to be done without any chef spitting the dummy and refusing on some kind of principle that it ruins the steak. All I wanted was it to be cooked plain and simple. How hard is that? It's no fun going to a restaurant and paying $48 for a steak that you can't eat as it might make you very ill.I felt sorry for the staff as they were very kind and understanding but I'm guessing they have no say when it comes to the chef.I visited the Restaurant on Friday 2nd October late afternoon and expected a lot better from a Jamie Oliver branded restaurant

Jamie- I'm a big fan of your style. This is why I picked this restaurant while on a business trip to Singapore. Food was very good. Started with a radicchio and rocket salad which was tossed perfectly in a slightly tart vinaigrette. Perfect size as a salad before a main course of pasta bolognese. Pasta was perfectly prepared and a memorable presentation, twirled up like a tornado which proves the pasta is still properly "al dente". Bolognese sauce was abundant and comforting, just what I was hoping for. Even noticed a slight bit of carrot and faint fennel (or Pernot?) to enhance the meaty toss.... as it should be....perfect dish. Unfortunately, I couldn't rate a 5 since no bread was offered or served (I noticed the bread station on the way out) and the house chianti was particularly poor (sour), even when paired with the hearty pasta.Bottom line, the kitchen is producing the product I'd expect from your hands, but overall service needs an upgrade to justify the price of S$62.00
1
Food is so so with really bad service! Will not come back. Wait staff service is bad. Food is totally overpriced. Can't just leverage on JO's namesake.
4
This is the finest rump steak that I have. It is tender and juice. I asked for medium rare and the chef really make it.
5
It's actually my second time here and i really like the food and the fact that they had different special dishes each time i am there. Additionally, the service provided was superb!
3
I had really high expectations for the food, it being Jamies and all. But sadly it fell way below. We had the Italian Nachos and minestrone soup for starters, wild mushroom risotto, italian burger and crab spaghetti for mains and the panna cotta and affogato for desserts.Only the Italian burger and the affogato were slightly above average. There were four of us and those who had the risotto and spaghetti and minestrone soup couldn't finish our food. The minestrone soup and risotto were both too bland for our liking. The crab spaghetti had a strong taste of the crab broth and though nice at first taste, it gets too overwhelming after eating half of it.The best part of our meal was the $10 drinks at happy hour. The red wine was good for its price of $10 per glass. Service staff were nice, ambience and location were both great.
4
Love the location and the staff were very attentive! The disappointments? I ordered bruschetta thinking I could share it with my husband. Out came one very small piece of toasted bread with tomato and ricotta. I thought there had been a mistake and queried the portion size. When I was told that was the usual size I asked them to remind me what the price was. $10.50! That was outrageously overpriced so I sent it back. The spaghetti and the carbonara dish were generous in portion size and were reasonably good. The vanilla ice-cream was to die for and the staff brought out a little cake which was beautifully presented for my husband's birthday which was very kind. I would go back - but I wouldn't order the bruschetta. In Singapore you can easily get a meal for the same price as that little slice of toast. Come on Jamie - I am sure your profit margin is such that you can afford to be more generous with a dish which is essentially comprised of bread and tomatoes - forget the ricotta if that is what's making it overpriced, many people don't like it anyway and would prefer a traditional bruschetta. Most restaurants use baguette for bruschetta but give you at least 4 slices and don't charge as much. Still - the staff made up for it as the service was amongst the best I have had from living in Singapore 22 years!

I have already knew Jamie giving me and my guests each an ice-cold glass of Jamie's Italian Prosecco as birthday treat when I 'Chope' a table for lunch. But made me surprised are, 1st, when I mention above treat at the 'reception' counter, 'We alert it.' answered from the staff. Wow!! Although have the 'similar' offer but I never ever heard that from any restaurant's staff to reply that! Some worse, they totally 'forgot' about it.2nd, after meals, Jamie gave me another surprised-a slice special decor birthday cake came with site sing birthday song! This made me almost watery.. and made my birthday unforgettable!!Really Touched of My Heart! Thank You! Jamie!!Last but not list, I want to thanks the staff name, Nat, who was serving us and sang the birthday song, Nat very friendly and knowledgeable of the meal. Thanks Nat

Unfortunately my recent experience was less than expected for this restaurant. I had ordered the Carbonara, but it arrived as a pile of congealed cold spaghetti. I have had this dish before at this restaurant, so I know this is not their usual, so there needs to be more attention given to a consistent product
4
We visited Jamie's Italian with 4 adults and 16month old for lunch. We were seated close the front and and the seats were amazingly comfortable. Service was very prompt and food came out within 20 minutes. All the food was tasty and well cooked, I had the hamburger which was huge! Drinks were awesome, highly recommend the fresh ginger beer. In summary we were happy with the service and food, the cost is a little expensive but it's like that at all Jamie Italian restaurants.
1
Visited 2nd time, hope the food will be better, however dont find the food as fantastic as what others said. Ambience is good, service was ok , food was terrible
3
Went here with friends for dinner and we were expecting delicious food, but what came was relatively average. My friend ordered the burger- the server did not ask him how he wants his steak, and it came thoroughly cooked and was very dry. I ordered the lamb chops and had to specify how I wanted them cooked (medium, rare, etc)- I was not asked by our server. The food came and had accompaniments that were not stated in the menu, I had to order a side order of fries because I'm not polenta's biggest fan. This place has so much potential, just a bit more effort next time.
2
this is our third visit. we like to give the benefit of the doubt but sadly, once again our experience was poor. after being seated and pouring over the menu for quite some time we were finally served. my daughter and I chose a prawn dish "Oh, I'm so sorry, no prawns tonight" - good service staff would tell you when you sit down what is NOT available? we chose a salad instead. We ordered fries that came out in a little cup, for $7.50 it felt like a rip off. My husband had Carbonara. His dish came out relatively quickly and he commented that "it was OK, probably could make it as good at home though".....he ate, finished....we continued to patiently wait for our salads. Finally they came....very ordinary indeed. we won't be back.
4
Jamie's Italian is a nice restaurant in the Vivo City Mall. We had salad for starters and pasta for the main course. The food is quite nice but the portions are rather small for the price. As usual at a TV cook restaurant...
5
First time at Jamie's Italian. Service was great! Love the fried squid so much! Romantic and comfortable ambience.
5
Food was excellent - the portions were just right and my kids loved it - as usual and staff very attentive
5
Went there to celebrate my business unit achievements. We ordered many sides and few mains to share. We love almost all of the them, except this particular baked mushroom we think is way too salty for us.Will definitely come visit this restaurant for special occasions next time
3
Heard much about Jamie's outlet at Vivo and sadly, most were not positive. Decided to try it out since it is part of the restaurant for this year's restaurant week Singapore. 3 selection of starters, mains and 2 dessert - 1 from each category. Look at my picture. Took soup, spaghetti, and ice cream. My partner took the ravioli nachos, burger and panna cota. Soup wasn't impressive, wasn't hot. Nachos looked interesting but texture & taste wise, it was lacking. Mains, for spaghetti, it will win by sheer volume... only. Sauce was a bit diluted, and spaghetti (although home made), had a soggy texture. Beef burger was the best choice, juicy and pretty big. For dessert, the espresso with vanilla ice cream saved me (as I had 2 glasses of prosecco) & it came timely. It was nice. The Panna cota was served with berries and it was sooooo sour.. I mean.. probably appeal to a certain crowd.. not me thou. Overall bill came up to sgd 138. 2 set dinner at 70. 4 glasses of prosecco 48. And taxes. Will I go again... perhaps not.. judging by the food served during restaurant week.. I was not impressed. But to be fair, they might have other signature dishes (I would have thought that dishes serves during restaurant week should have been more carefully selected as it paves the way for returning customers)... Sorry, no picture of dessert as I was not interested in taking photos after the mains.. Noteworthy, service was very good, and a bit of wait should be expected as they are really busy. Was served by a well mannered, good looking waiter, who has been professional in his deliverance of service.
5
The service was great. We enjoyed yourselves. The environment was lovely and the food was delicious. Will definitely come back again. 
3
We started going to Jamie's Italian in London. Food, ambience were sooo good there.Here in Vivo City, location and view were not bad. Fried squid, spaghetti with prawns and panna cotta were still good. But we were so disappointed with the other food: Mini-burgers, shake salad, superfood salad, polenta cake.Our waitress was super friendly and nice though
3
Clearly, you are paying for the "Jamie Oliver" brand and you can get better, more reasonably priced Italian food elsewhere. That said, paying a bit extra to guarantee a good experience can be worth it and if you are stuck at VivoCity, it's a good option. Food is good, authentic, well presented and served efficiently. Just don't travel to VivoCity just for Jamie's Italian. For one thing, the wait in the taxi line home will spoil your night for sure. If you aren't at VivoCity, I would suggest searching the pages of TripAdvisor a bit more, e.g. Bella Pasta in Robertson Walk
3
As frequent visitors to Singapore, we have visited many different restaurants but found this to be very disappointing. We were quick to be seated and that was about it! We had to flag down a waiter to order and the food took forever to come. The children's meals were a good size and value for money, but I found the adult's meals extremely expensive for what they were. We also had to ask twice for the bill
4
Jamie Oliver is a household name and brand; expectations are naturally developed and raised. However, one pointer that you may want to take note of prior to your visit to the inaugural outlet ,don’t expect that Jamie Oliver is cooking in the kitchen., Jamie’s Italian it is a casual Italian restaurant, catering to the masses with fuss-free cuisine of rustic and homely pastas. It’s definitely not the superior fine-dining establishment that many might be expecting across all Jamie Oliver’s restaurants. In my opion, I think it blends in perfectly with Singapore’s local food scene, the ambiance as a good atmosphere and excellent service with friendly well trained staff, the food is tasty, and fresh with high price tag. I have enjoyed my visit to Jamie’s and will return again. I like the relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff who make you feel at home, , and most of all , simple unpretentious food
5
The food and service is very good. They arranged our group to be in this nice side where we celebrated birthday :)
5
Jamie's restaurants never fail to deliver a great dining experience in any location. The ambiance, the service and of course the food are up to this high standard in Singapore even for a casual lunch.
4
Wasn't sure about this at first. But place had good atmosphere. Was busy at 6.30 Friday night. King Prawn linguine was gorgeous !! Small portion was on expensive side st £9.
4
Had a family dinner and my daughter reserved seating for 6 but when we butt here our reservation did not appeared. Luckily my daughter did not erase the email confirming the reservation. We were seated shortly thereafter. Our food selection amongst us varied. The pasta with prawns was good, tasty however the pasta was not al dente. My daughters and wife dish of pasta bolognese was a bit dry. The other dishes were fine. For the price we expected a better prepared pasta dish
2
A friend and I wanted a light lunch together yesterday. Having already had a positive experience at the new Jamie restaurant in Forum on Orchard Road, I suggested we give Vivo a try. Such a disappointment. Sadly we had to chose to sit inside due to the haze (not their fault). We ordered some olives with bread to start with. The server returned 5 minutes later to tell us there were no olives, as they were yet to be delivered. Seriously?! I politely suggested that patrons should be informed of this beforehand. We then ordered 2 salads: mine was a starter ~ think it was called the heritage something. It was tiny, and very unimpressive. Can't even begin to remember what was in it. My friend ordered the superfood salad. Poorly presented with 2 triangular blocks of feta plonked on the side. When questioned about the small size (except for the feta lumps) and why it was so expensive for so little, we were told it was because all the ingredients were sourced from overseas. I could go on but I think you've probably got the gist! We both dine out from time to time and mostly have very positive experiences in Singapore, and will always give positive feedback when it's due. The servers were polite but looked a little non-plussed to say the least. We were both still hungry after our meals but decided to go elsewhere for coffee and dessert.I can't believe Mr Oliver would have been happy about that
5
As great fans of Jamie`s in Nottingham we were intrigued to try the Singapore location. We were not disappointed, great pasta, scrumptious wine, friendly service and a fantastic view across the harbour. Wonderful and interesting to see the pasta being freshly made. And ......as per usual...... impeccable toilets
4
Great ambience, good service overall. Not only was food awesome, it arrived promptly as well. Service was fairly good, although for the slightly higher price point, we would expect slightly more attention to detail (for example, our request for side plates was not acted upon, even though the plates were well within reach, so we went to get it ourselves). Otherwise, the experience was generally good
4
Awesome and just perfect for a hot date!!! I have been there ones and this time is on a date with a great dining eerie cd too...  
3
The ambience was awesome, speedy service n fresh food..The ingredients of e food is kinda new to us, so it got a 3 from us..other than tt, Jamie's Italian is an awesome family restaurant!! :
3
The salads stood out the most among the dishes we ordered.. Service wasn't the most friendly. Quite a disappointing experience in general
3
Below expectation.
nice deco
meat too well done = dry & hard
tiramisu cake has nice orange taste.
Brownie is TOO sweeet!
Not sure wanna give them a 2nd chance to try out their other dishes......
4
Loved the ambience and the service was good too. Didn't find anything particularly amazing about the bolognese but the pasta was made well. The cured meat plank was awesome as was the mushroom pasta (the name escapes me). Drinks were nice too!
5
Visited with three kids - excellent menu and good selection for the kids as well. Friendly and efficient service.
4
Nice ambience with thoughtful and helpful staff. Food is alright for its pricing. Do take note that their portions are pretty small as well.
3
We ordered POSH Fries, Calamari and Baked Mushroom for starters and Prawn pasta & Mushroom Risotto as Main course. We also had the Gelatos as desserts. Overall I will rate the starters 4/5. Though the portions are small. The prawn pasta was good based on the feedback of those who ate it. But for me, Risotto is not well prepared. Rice is too hard. I can almost consider it as undercooked.
4
Jamie's Italian was very satisfying for myself & family. We have 3 kids (ages 10 & under), but my husband. & I were tired of basic 'kid' food. The ambiance was modern & inviting. We were greeted promptly and had nothing but exceptional service throughout the night. Our menu choices were not challenging for the chef -- pasta, chicken, salads, etc. but everything was tasty, hot, well seasoned & satisfying. I would completely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a change from the ordinary- but still need basics to satisfy Western tastes
5
Two of us Jamie's Italian at Vivocity while recently staying on Sentosa. The restaurant was busy even on a Monday night. This place has a really nice atmosphere, you do not feel like you are eating in a mall/shopping centre restaurant.My parter and I got a bottle of wine and five dishes to share, the food was very nice and the service was good. Our meal came in at SGD 120 inclusive of service and taxes which I thought was reasonable for Singapore especially considering we got a bottle of wine.Check this place out next time you visit Vivocit
2
We came at lunch time and its quite crowded. We order its pork chop, burger italiano and crispy squid. The food tasted quite good but its a hit and miss for us. While it taste good, there is a small part of the pork with blood in it, and i choose to ignore it and just cut it aside. My partner stop eating her burger after the first few bites. Then i try it and found out that the patty is burnt and overcooked, it taste dry and bitter. I told the staff and they offer us an exchange the burger but we choose to change it to pasta. At least the penne carbonara does tasted good. The crispy squid is popular and tasted good but some chunks is too salty.Based on our experience, its not worth a second visit. I think its unacceptable to served a burnt patties as its visibly charcoal black
5
So I don't even know if Jamie Oliver has been to singapore but this restaurant is so good: it is perfect. This is a big place so there is plenty of room. They play funky music and has rustic decor. Menu is Italian and they have real food - my kids asked for tomato sauce and what came was like tomato pesto - amazing. For my starter I had the baked mushroom which was a really nice portion. I also shared a bruschetta which was very good. For the main course i had the fish plank - I wish I had been warned because it was like small bits of food - it was okay but I would have preferred it as an appetiser. I also tried the mushroom risotto which had this nice smokey smell from the oven. They also had the children's menu and kids could do colouring At 9pm, from the opposite site which is sentosa there was even 5 minutes of fireworks which was great way to end the evening !!
2
Have been here before and had great experiences.Food was undercooked, served cold and watery. Staff was in a hurry to close the kitchen.Can't be paying such exorbitant amounts for crap food
4
Visited here with some friends for brunch. Their breakfast menu has a decent selection of food and drinks. They do serve their normal menu if you want. Food tasted good as I have a non-stop craving for decent British sausages. Give it a try!
2
Disappointed with their terrible service, sharp difference compared to forum branch. Took us ages to get their attention. From serving us water, getting our orders, having our meals served and asking for the bill. The servers don't bother looking eye-level and it was SO frustrating trying to get their attention.
5
it was great that the restaurant offered small or half portions so we could order more flavors of pasta. We also shared a simple salad just to make sure we have our greens for the day. Noodles were perfectly cooked. The shrimp in tomato sauce was delicious. It's hard to choose which pasta tasted better. I can have more of each. Thank you Jamie for this experience
3
Staff untrained and uninterested. Have to ask for everything. But given the quality of food and ambiance will return and recommend. Maybe we were just unlucky and attack had a bad day.
1
Came here for my wedding anniversary celebration but it was a totally disappointment. The service and atmosphere was good but the food was really not up to expectations - the linguine was too hard!!! No intention to visit the 2nd time..
4
I was here for dinner today. We ordered four (4) pasta dishes and a burger. The food was average, not bad but also nothing to rave about. I liked that they did not have iced lemon tea on their menu but the staff arranged with the kitchen staff to concoct an iced lemon tea for me! That and the staff's consistent attentiveness and warmth made it a very pleasant dining experience. I'll probably try the restaurant again because I would really like to be wowed not just by the service but also the food
5
I just got back from celebrating a friend's birthday at Jamie's Italian. This was my second time to the restaurant and a far better experience than the first. My dish - the pork chop was delicious, the ambiance was great and the staff were attentive (nice touch with a birthday dessert!). I'm looking forward to my next visit
3
I was actually quite surprised my first comment on the pork skin being too tough was heard and the Grilled Pork was almost perfect this time round. Except for the part that my gum and my forearm were rather sore after having the dish. To be honest, there is nothing majorly wrong with Jamie's in Singapore. But thinking practically, it's a rather competitive world these days. I could walk a few minutes and find dozens of choices with some selling probably the same cuisine and the same prices, if not lesser. So, end of the day, sometimes it's the nitty gritty that win the customers heart. I couldn't enter the restaurant without being spotted by a smile and that's a plus. I didn't have to wait for the menu or flag my arm in the air like I'm drowning to get the wait staffs attention, and that's a plus too. I was served the wrong dish. That's a minor no. My beer was forgotten and appeared on my bill, that's a forgivable mistake for a local Coffeeshop. I had chipped bones hidden in my pork chop that almost took away 2 of my teeth. But I had fun with it forming a smiley. One thing for sure, I didn't have to write such a long review if it's their flagship store in Australia. Why
4
Overall our experience is good. Unfortunately the sizes in some of the plates are small. The Tavola of meat has two shaved slices of jam , The ravioli are delicious but are just 6 in the plate. So the relation between the portions of food and the money you pay is not given
2
We are big fans of Jamie' Italian d have visited on every country we have visited. Saw the restaurant near Vivo City so dropped by at lunchtime and asked for a seat outside (half were empty inside and all empty outside). No acknowledgement we'd walked in initially, then when we did get asked, we were told they would need to check and unbelievable no space ...... It was half empty? Anyway chop house over the road got our business and very tasty it was to
4
I expected more from Jamie's restaurant. Anyway the food was tasty, Italian beer beer amazing, the staff very polite and well trained. I would say regarding it was lunch the cost was a bit expensive.

Tried Jamie's Italian in Singapore. The atmosphere and environment are ok but probably trying a bit hard. I ordered the ginger beer and was served lemonade. When it was replaced with ginger beer it was almost undrinkable. The ginger overpowered the other flavours. The rest of the food was bland and uninteresting
2
Great staff...bland food...what a shame as other Jamie's Italian Restaurants globally have great food and a great vibe.I've also tried the new Jamie's Italian on Orchard Road. Oh my goodness, I am sure Jamie would be gutted with the standard of some dishes and lack of care factor when you follow up with the staff. Specifically their pizzas - I do not know how someone can botch a margarita pizza but I now know it is entirely possible. The staff need to be better trained in receiving constructive feedback. It is never easy dealing with customers who have not had a great experience, but it is equally as bad when the customers are ignored and left with the feeling that it doesn't matter what their opinions are because there are many others that will come eat at the establishment because it has Jamie Oliver's name attached.

Very happy with the food, the atmosphere and the service. Great place for lunch or dinner with friends or colleagues ... Or celebrating anniversary like my wife and I did. Teety and her team are doing a great job making the atmosphere special and warm from the heart. Today's food was great. The sea bass was fresh and full of flavours. The chef made the best of it with fine herbs, tomatoes and olives. My wife tenderloin was cooked perfectly and the French fries with garlic were very yummie ! Special attention to the home made ketchup. ;-)Definitely a must try/ go place in Singapore (I will visit again with my little one as I can see the very kid-friendly environment, such as special menu, crayons, smiley staff...). PS: attention and great service are in the details: my wife and i were touched surprised by the very nicely decorated anniversary cake. Superb. And thanks for the extra centilitres of beer. :-)

Service and ambience were great but the food was average. Was very surprised pizza is not in the menu (Italian Restaurant???) 
5
Food was great, but highlight was the service. I have never experienced such personal service in Singapore before, they were happy to relocate us as our original seat, being close to the kitchen was really warm.Great pasta and dessert. Will definitely come back again

Situated in a mall, but the back of the restaurant faces out toward the harbour. We like Jamies style of food, but the restaurant, was just average. Our pasta dishes were ok, but not how Jamie would do his, but I guess thats what you get, when a chef just puts his name on a restaurant. Staff friendly, but for us it was just a bit meh
5
The staff was very friendly and gave good recommendations with polite and professional manners. I would like to compliment the staff looking after our table - his name is Mark and he had definitely made me and my boy-friend a great night. The foods were good with a very reasonable price and the atmosphere was comfortable which we really enjoyed our dinner

Before its opening in Singapore, there were lots of talk about it being owned by a world renowned chef and that the food must be of excellent quality - high standards. I beg to differ!!My wife and I ordered a seafood linguine and a beef steak to share. Both were total disappointment. The pasta was overcooked and was practically tasteless, save for the sauce that came with it. The steak was cooked to my liking but it was cold when I took the first bite. Really, this must be a joke!! The food served by the restaurant definitely don't live up to all the talk. Sadly, it is owned by a reputable chef. Try Jack'sPlace for steak and pasta mania for pasta. They served better food and are priced much lower
5
Visited the Harbor front just to eat at Jamie's. Was available to walk in almost right away and was seated by the kitchen which had a view of the Harbor, right away a plus point. The food was simply delicious and the epic brownie... YES it was truly EPIC. Would visit many times just to try all the items on the Menu but would order the brownie every time
5
Not an Italian restaurant, a restaurant that serves Italian food.
Not surprisingly, great food. I'll say no more.
But the ambience, the atmosphere - the place is electric.
Great, so great service.
Great look and feel, I can't say it enough. A must go.

My third visit a few weeks ago is the last. From opening to now, the food & service has deteriorated significantly. Used to have to book in advance or queue up - now you can just walk in to a 30% occupied restaurant at lunchtime. During my last visit there was a new kale salad - the waitress firstly didn't know if it was still on the menu, was unsure of the ingredients, I had to ask twice for it & the small dish arrived half way through my main meal. My main bowl of pasta was returned to the kitchen for a meat sauce top-up, and considering the $27 price tag it should have been on the plate in the first place. Yet again another restaurant having to pay the service charge for something that was non-existent
3
High hopes for the squid ink pasta: texture was admirable but completely disappointed in taste. Burger was ok, couldn't bring ourselves to try anything else
1
When the restaurant first opened its door, I had lunch and found the service and food over- rated. I gave it the benefit of doubt - it still needed time to get things right. Years later, the food is still uninspiring and tasteless.  
3
I had been to Jamie's Italian at VivoCity after one long day at Sentosa with my little one. We were starving and while looking for something to eat, found this one mostly empty of customers because lunch time had been long gone. We experienced a nice, quiet atmosphere and relaxed while eating all the way through dessert. The food, though pricey, was absolutely perfect, so I did not mind the cost. The waiters were extremely helpful and flexible, something rare in Singapore. I remember that upon our arriving, a large jug of cold water was placed at our table without us requesting for it. Nice touch, especially in a hot place as in Singapore. After leaving, I vowed this would be our top choice for lunch at VivoCity. And so we returned at another day for dinner after being to the movies. This time we were placed by the kitchen and it was a full house. Of course, I'd expect the ambiance to be noisier, but sitting by an open kitchen was overwhelming with dishes clattering and waiters flowing through non-stop. I'd suggest at least a glass wall to bar some of the sound. But what caught my attention the most was many of the waiters' behaviour, which I'd say was a bit unprofessional. There was too much joking about, laughing out loud, as if they were having their own party with no regard for customers. This time we did not stay for dessert, for I found the atmosphere too unpleasant. We had ice cream at Awfully Chocolate instead. For our first visit I'd rate it with the highest score here, but seeing how the restaurant functions during a busy hour, I'm glad I have experienced the real thing so that I can rate it more fairly. So, I give it a 3 because its waiters need to be trained properly and the noise was over the top for a gourmet restaurant. If I see that these issues are resolved, I'll definitely return, for the food was great. However, an eating experience is not only about the food
4
A nice quaint place with a good outside view. The octopuss and scallop black pasta was awesome. The steak was ok. The service was very sweet . Gave us lot of recommendation. Try the japenese beers they have. Also the mangeta dessert was a miss. Try the cake with Liquer. Its better. But its expensive for sure.
5
Beautiful birthday celebration. Desserts were beautifully decorated and was indeed delicious in taste. The panna cotta is by far the best we have had in years. The staff is very accommodating and is always willing to make our dining experience a pleasurable one. Will definitely be there again and hopefully to try out the their whole menu.

We have wedding anniversary today hence I wanted to give my wife a pleasant surprise, so yesterday I reserved a table for breakfast at 10:15 through the Jamie's web site and got an immediate confirmation on e-mail and SMS, even confirming my special added message to the booking: "Our wedding aniversary. Chocolate cake for my wife?" "We will do our best to accommodate your request." I had pre-ordered a 3-course set menu, and that was also confirmed. Then the fun began. Even though the booking was made online, when we arrived they had managed to get my name misspelled and did not have a clue about wedding anniversary or how many people. We were guided to a table and after a long while we managed to get attention from a waiter that knew nothing about a 3-course set menu whatsoever. Then, I asked her to check my booking. Ages later some manager showed up and explained that the booking system was English and not compatible with Singapore! Silly me I should have understood that. No mention about our wedding anniversary. But generously enough we were allowed to order from the menu. I ordered an American coffee and got a long black. The waiter told me those are the same. Go back to school young man. The rest we ordered was just fine but please do not fill up the orange juice glass with ice cubes to save money. Orange juice is orange juice, not a cocktail. Jamie, you can do better than this
5
We walked in and found a table straight away (6pm). It got busier later (walk-ins had to wait, so perhaps make a reservation if wanting to dine later). Views overlooking the water were lovely at night. Can dine indoors or outside. We had the mushrooms and polenta chips for entree, crab spaghetti for main and shared different desserts (pavlova, tiramisu, and lemon meringue). All delicious and reasonably priced. Service was polite and food arrived within a reasonable time.
4
I went here because I was in the area and I found the "voucher" for a free dessert there in the hotel concierge map I got at the Conrad. More on that later. I visited on Sunday without a reservation around 1.30pm. I had to wait a few minutes to get seated, place was packed.The deal was free dessert if you order a main or large pasta. I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli, the apple mojito and lemon meringue cheesecake for dessert. The pasta serving size was small, so if you were a big eater or a guy you need to get a side or appetizer as well. What there was, was delicious and very well presented. The sauce was garlicky, but luckily the apple mojito cut down on the garlic breath after effects.I ended up waiting for quite a while for the dessert. I did visit at a really busy time of day so some waiting was to be expected. It took a while to flag down a waiter to get a dessert menu, and then 25 minutes after ordering for the dessert to appear. The waiters apologized a few times for the delay so at least they were attentive. The dessert was worth the wait, was light and tangy and amazing. It was a pity that I ate it so quickly as I had to leave, so I didn't get to properly savour the taste as long as I would have liked. Tip 1 : If you like to take your time when visiting a special restaurant, choose a less busy time of day or during the week. Note that Vivocity is next to a cruise ship terminal so if there's a boat in then chances are all the nearest eating places will be packed, and Jamie's is right next door the the cruise terminal.Tip 2 : the "voucher" in the concierge map doesn't mention anywhere that you have to prove you are an international traveller/tourist to claim the deal by presenting your passport- and this was only mentioned right when I asked for the bill. Luckily I had my passport on me anyway as you can't really "un-eat" the dessert afterwards... I found this deal also mentioned in the Tourist Privileges card booklet that you can get from the info desks at Vivocity. You need to show your passport to claim one of those, so presumably you would already have it on hand if you found the deal via Vivocity

Had gone to the restaurant with an open mind after having read the not-so-good reviews and was pleasantly surprised.
4
Brilliant food. Especially if you need to carb it up after lots of walking/shopping. The service isn't very good though. We had to pay our bill at the front as no one was paying any attention to us and then we were told we had to pay at the table which we said we couldn't do as we had to get on with our shopping while we could! I have been here before. In fact my family and I were the first family to have dined here. The service was brilliant back then but that's because everyone was watching, learning and were excited about the new venture. I would still go back regardless of this as the food quality is just outstanding. The price was pretty reasonable to where I'm from (Perth) but then, again, that's not saying much aside from making holidays less scary based on prices in comparison
3
Lots of delicious sounding options on the menu, but they don't quite live up to expectations. The $22 margarita pizza was served with five tiny little pieces of mozzarella. The table next to us complained also, but the staff did nothing but offer to take it way. Iced olives were a great idea but the olive tapenade tasted like sweet onions. French fries were served cold with no ketchup. When we requested ketchup, what appeared tasted like pasta sauce. Cute kids menu and coloring options, but no kids plate or cups. Cauliflower florets and kale salad were very good. Service was so so. We ordered the pizza as soon as we sat down so my son would have something to eat fast, but the waitress forgot to put the order in so it came out last.
5
Made a reservation via Chope. Managed to get a comfy seat. We ordered pork chop and truffle spaghetti. Serving is big and the food is delicious. Initially wanted to order a dessert but they did not have it that day. Probably will be good if they can tell us in advance when passing us the dessert menu to avoid disappointment
5
We arrived on a packed Friday night for a quick meal for the 3 of us and we weren't disappointed! We sat outside which although was hot wasn't uncomfortable and the view was amazing. We shared the nachos for starters and all had a different pasta dish for mains followed by the cheesecake for afters. It came swiftly, served courteously and was of ample size. We have definately found out new favourite place!
5
Great Italian dishes, well made and well presented. The food quality is top and the waiters and waitresses are very friendly. I strongly recommend this Resturant for anyone looking for Italian food here. The only thing I may comment on is that the service might be a bit slow due to having a lot of customers because mostly the tables are full.
3
I visited Jamie's both at lunch and dinner.. at lunch the place was packed and service quite slow. Food was good, i remember enjoying Black ink seafood linguine and a baked aubergine parmigiana.At dinner, fast and attentive service, food still good but need to point out Arancini mushroom, despite well made, they lack flavor.Red wine was served a little too warm. Overall a nice place if you like rustic Italian, simple and casual service in a very good locatio
2
Went for breakfast.....Great location, friendly staff with a nice premises.... But found the food was cold, not very much of it with coffee also serviced cold. Music was so loud that it was irritatingSeems a bit disorganised, but it maybe a consequence of being in the morning. I did expect better given the branding promise of Jamie Oliver....Unfortunately I wont be going back given the range of choices at Vivo Cit
4
The service was very good. They we're friendly and nice. The food was not really wonderful, but the service was spectacular.
3
Could not get into for dinner so we booked breakfast the next day. Lovely table settings and good atmosphere even though the music was a little loud. Menu seemed cool. Disappointed in the time it took for the food to come - and then it was almost cold - as was the coffee. Saving grace - the bacon was delicious. Should we try dinner sometime? Not sure
5
The food is fresh and natural . I don't taste any artificial taste enhancers. Though I must say the fries can be a bit more crispy.
4
A special thanks to Nicole for her service and attention to my mum who eats gluten free. She was very attentive and knowledgeable as she should be. Our food was delicious and very enjoyable. Only point which I could fault was the meringue desert. This was not prepared in-house and was very hard and not as we expected. Our table was at the window overlooking the Harbour walk and was a great view. The restaurant was casual with pucker food and worth a visit. Great slings too !
2
I have been to a few of Jamie's restaurants around the world. They have similar menus, quality and value. As with any chain the food is average.On this visit I had to remind the staff two times to bring our drinks order. They didn't arrive until after the main course had arrived. The main problem came when I asked for parmesan on my pasta. I was told that Jamie recommends the particular dish be served without parmesan. When I made it clear that this would not change my preference, I was astonished to be told 'Jamie says NO'. At this point i suspected that Jamie might have been in a room in the back conducting the waitress via an ear piece.When I insisted again the waitress refused to sprinkle the parmesan over my pasta and dumped a spoonful in the corner of my bowl which quickly congealed. I had to try and crumble the melted cheese over my pasta with my fingers.Regardless of guidance given to staff, personal preference and customer service should be the number one goal of service staff, I am sure that Jamie would agree with this
2
Food was not better than any average pub except more expensive!Meat was too salty and over cooked.Poorly manage franchise using a famous name to make believe the food will be special. However, it was not the case.We won't go back
3
The husband and I visited the restaurant for lunch after a hot day at Sentosa. We ordered truffle fries, squid ink pasta and for me, a mushroom pasta with breadcrumbs (something along that line). The food was very average in my opinion. The truffle fries were a letdown because I hardly tasted the truffle. Both the pasta dishes lack punch too (and salt). I am a big fan of Jamie Oliver's healthy approach to meals but the food here just don't do anything for me nor my husband. We aren't picky eaters at all but if we are paying more than sgd$70 for lunch, I am very sure we could get much better food elsewhere. Skip this and go straight to the food court
4
few of us went there for dinner. the place is inside a big mall that looks quite busy with fashion shoppers. The place looks and feel from what you would expect from Jammy Oliver, casual and good. The menu had quite a few things and we tried a few starters that were all very tasty. For main I took the risotto that was very good and the green salad that was Ok. Others tried the steaks that all look great. For desert I tried the gelato that was tasty and the tiramisu looked very good. The prices were not too bad ($50-60 PP)
4
Nice casual ambience. Friendly waiting staffs. Food has room for improvement. Ok overall visit. Should visit at least once for experience.   
2
This was about my 5th visit to Jamie's Italian. I want to like it. I really do. But I've given up. Only once did the meal work well for everyone at our table. Today was unfortunately typical. I really don't think this is how Jamie would want his restaurant to be performing! There were three for brunch, drinks were really slow to be served, we had other people's empty and half-used sugar sticks in the sugar bowl on the table, two of the three place mats had orange circular stains from previous customer's drinks and crumbs all over them and two meals arrived cold. Is it too hard to heat plates? The American-Style Berry Pancakes arrived so cold that the orange mascapone on top didn't melt at all! The berry coulis on the side tasted good as did the orange mascapone, but there was no maple syrup. The Mini Vege Works with a bacon side order also arrived barely warm. Probably due to the fact it was served in a very thick, heavy duty ceramic pan that was STONE-COLD! The portobello mushrooms sitting on the dish were cold, the spinach was just warm, the egg and bacon were also barely warm. The baked beans were served in a cute small wrought iron bowl, which also seemed to suck all the heat out of them. It was such a shame as the food tasted fairly good, but it was spoilt by being cold. I commented to our server. She proceeded to process full payment, then offered to pass my comment onto the manager. I queried what good will that do? We already ate cold food (my daughters were really hungry so we didn't re-order!) and she had paid now processed full payment for the bill. The manager, Brian, came over as we were leaving and he said to return for dinner and he would make sure we enjoyed good service. That just isn't good enough. A $95 brunch for three with two meals served cold ended with an invitation to come back and spend more money and get good service? I don't think so. Four out of five strikes were fouls. I am done
3
We had high expectations however the food turned out to be pretty average. The nibbles and sides are good however mains were substandard. Ravioli sauce was extremely thin and tasted like milk. Stake was okay
4
The ambiance here is quite different to what we expected - it's quite laidback yet chic, almost industrial shabby chic. The service is the one thing that really stood out - smiling and informed, our server was able to make good recommendations and also knew her wine and coffee, a huge plus.We had the Crispy Porcini Mushroom Arancini to start with - it wasn't anything to write home about though, we could hardly taste the mushroom in it. For mains, we had the Rotolo Al Forno (which I truly enjoyed. The slight hint of sweet from the pumpkin, the creaminess of the Ricotta, an the al dente pasta sheets came together really well) and the Rigatoni Pomodoro done Arabiatta style (fairly good too). For dessert, we had the Tiramisu (despite being an orange-chocolate fan, I found the orange mascarpone slightly overpowering) and Baked Almond Fruit tart (decadent and excellent).Overall, we really enjoyed dining here and would probably go back again
4
Great food and a very nice atmosphere. The taste was good but the presentation is just awesome. I've added s few pictures so you guys can see for yourself.
2
Disappointed with staff knowledge and situation handling. When asked about how to pair alcoholic drink with beef dish, staff look blank. Miscommunication between kitchen and waitress and floor manager, when one person said food need another 5-8 to serve, on the other hand food already served, really unnecessary interruption to guest with not accurate info. Also slow in taking initiative to serve side order if they expect kitchen may be slow in serving the main course.I complain about the uncooked chicken dish to waitress, she asked me if she need to replace me a with a brand new set? After took my unfinished plate away, what she send me back is the floor manager, and floor manager explained to me pink chicken meat is normal, and he added on "you can look for me if u hv problem with ur stomach" . I wonder when did our f&b training school had try a new breed of doctor in this sector? Anyway, they never bring back to me my unfinished food. And the dinner cost me close to sgd 160. Bad experience on my first visit to the place, I'm sure I won't go back again and very certain won't recommend my friend to do do. Extremely disappointe
4
After having to fight through queues at Jamie's in Perth, it is nice being able to go to Jamie's and walk in without a booking and get seated straight away. The fact that they do a gluten free pasta is a big plus, and our 9yo GF boy wolfed it down. We went twice during this trip and both times were good. Free wifi and no rush to turn over tables.
2
This meal was just disappointing despite the hype. I really couldn't believe it. I am a Jamie Oliver fan and was looking forward to trying the food. I came here with my partner in September, and both our pastas were undercooked... almost raw. The water that was used to fill our cups was also a little murky and the server helpfully replaced it for us. Despite that, the water still turned out a little murky. But that wasn't a big issue. The pasta was really lackluster. I would like to give this place another chance but looking at the other reviews, I really don't think I can
1
If anyone tried to serve a coffee like this in Italy or Spain, or even Melbourne, there would be rioting in the streets. It was served on a tall glass and was so milky, there was no discernible taste of coffee. When I asked for a coffee with coffee in it, I had to pay $17 so we could both have a double shot. And it was still only average! Clearly no one in the kitchen has been to Italy so I don't know how they are passing this restaurant off as authentic italian... Give this a wide berth.
3
The restaurant is lovely inside and the service was good, however, both my and my daughter's pasts was undercooked.. For $30 plus taxes a main course it should have been pretty good..
2
First of all, I have to say that I am a HUGE fan of Jamie Oliver and I was so excited when he opened this restaurant in July 2013. I had been here several times since its opening. The very first time I went there, I remember ordering the Pink Snapper Acqua Pazza and was so blown away by the flavour of the dish; I just couldn’t stop raving about it. Unfortunately my subsequent visits to Jamie’s Italian Vivo City were less successful; I feel that the quality of the food had deteriorated immensely (what happened to portion control too??) and I feel quite disappointed to say the least. I just went there again last night - this was at least my 3rd visit (my previous visit we found all the food to be very salty) - with 4 friends for dinner. I've always loved the decor and ambience of Jamie's Italian Vivo City, so at least we had a really nice setting and great atmosphere for dinner; very cozy and classy but also very "homey". Kudos to the Interior Designer (s) or whoever is responsible for such a lovely restaurant design.First of all, I would like to commend our server for the night (unfortunately I couldn't remember her name, sorry. It was Joan or Joanne or something) as she was very helpful and the service was excellent, so just to clarify that whatever “less-than-perfect” feedback I am going to write in this review has nothing to do whatsoever with the service staff; she was great! For appetizers we ordered the Crispy Calamari, the Baked Mushroom and the “Italian Nachos". The Crispy Calamari was a little bit greasy and doesn't have much flavour. Nothing to write home about on the Baked Mushroom either. The "Italian Nachos", I have to say was the worst of the lot. It was fried ravioli stuffed with three cheeses but I really couldn't taste any of the different cheeses, tasted all the same to me and it was really quite bland; completely tasteless, thankfully the spicy arrabbiata dipping sauce provided that much-needed "kick" (this arrabbiata sauce was quite delicious by the way and with just the right amount of heat/spiciness) to at least give it a bit of...well, at least abit of "something"...?For the main courses, we ordered two of the ‘Today’s Specials’: the Linguine with Prosciutto (can’t remember the rest of the ingredients or even the sauce) and I had the whole Sea Bass with some 'sweet and sour' sautéed vegetables. My Sea Bass was again, just "okay"...and my friend commented the Prosciutto Pasta was "not nice". Another friend ordered the 220 grams Rump Steak, I thought the Steak was pretty nice, cooked well (we ordered it Medium Rare) and the Skinny Fries was quite addictive. We also ordered the Prawn Linguine which was also just "so so"...but the most disappointing one of all was the Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli! When it was served to us, all of our eyes were glued on that plate and we were in such awe (I wish it was due to a  positive reason) because the portion was so miserable! We were like "Really?? That's all??" There were maybe 6 Ravioli in it; one "thin layer" of Ravioli at the bottom of that plate, looking as if somebody has just finished the rest of it and it was just some leftover food on a plate! Please understand that it really pains me to have to write this review because as I mentioned earlier on, I am a huge fan of Jamie Oliver; the taste and the quality of the food we had last night was just not the kind that we would expect from "The Naked Chef". It is so below par from what we know he is capable of especially since we had such a wonderful meal there before. We do not mind paying the amount we paid last night for really good quality food but I really feel the prices were really too much and the food was not worth what we had paid for it at all.I really hope someone could do something about maintaining the standard and quality that Jamie's Italian worldwide is famous for. I hope to return soon and (hopefully) be able to enjoy the delicious and wonderful food that Jamie's Italian @ Vivo City had managed to deliver before.

Jamie Oliver presents authentic and affordable Italian food for the burgeoning middle-class of Singapore. Striking a fine balance between exquisite flavor and affordability, Jamie Oliver's Italian restaurant was a discovery for the ages. Being intrepid adventures who constantly go on the prowl for new dining prey on the internet Serengeti, we encountered what is undoubtedly the only dodo bird in existence. Marrying obscenely scrumptious food with impeccable service, the restaurant was a symphony of sensory stimulation for the eyes, nose, ears and taste buds. The service staff were so courteous to a fault that any dictator would want to employ them in his palace without hesitation. They were also so knowledgeable about the food that Alton Brown would be jealous, rising up to the occasion like a gladiator before Caesar offering detailed explanations about each dish and the manner in which they should be eaten. Food-wise, we began our trip down what can only be described as an LSD-induced high without the LSD, with a plank of cured meats supported by a couple of barely pretentious cans of tomato sauce. Indulging in our porcine tendencies, we buried our snouts in a bouquet of truffle oil fries embellished with Parmesan floss. The aptly named Crispy Squid (to differentiate itself from the plebeian calamari) was nothing short of an exercise in reaffirming one's middle-class position.The food which we were fortunate enough to have grace our lowly palettes were: Truffle Tagliatelle, Bolognese Tagliatelle, Squid Ink Pasta and Risotto. There was no false advertising to be had with their claim of "Fresh Pasta". The springiness and depth of flavor of the pasta caressed our tongues and titillated our taste buds. At the risk of sounding like heretics, the only critique we can muster is our privileged stomachs were too big for the portions offered.In conclusion, this review does absolutely no justice in conveying the unadulterated majesty and resplendence of the restaurant that is Jamie's Italian. Just like how one trip is not equal to a 1000 travel books, you must place a visit to this oasis of culture and civilization in this chaotic world we live in (filled with strife, suffering and poor taste) on your bucket list. You will not regret it

First visit and was impressed. It's live up to it name! Food was excellent and servicing staff is helpful! Just that the place seem overcrowded. Remember to make a reservation before heading down! Will return visit

Had a business dinner at this restaurant at the crowded Vivo City Mall. Again the reception was attentive but after we got seated the service was a little wanting. The food was again fresh and tasty. We had a bottle of the Talimonte Rose which is one I would highly recommend and is a favourite at this establishment. My business colleagues had the spicier version of the prawn linguine, a steak and risotto. Very good in all cases. For dessert we shared a pavolova. Worth a visit. This is NOT a michelin star place but is value for a good view and great food

+Excellent initiative and service from waiting staff+Good food+Nice environment Came here for a casual lunch with a small child; there was a short wait for a table but it was Sunday, and the restaurant was crowded, so it was fine. When the waitress saw that our child was asleep, she took the initiative of giving us a corner sofa table so we would have more space. This was a massive help. Our child ended up sleeping for close to 2.5 hours, and in that period there was never any pressure to leave and the staff did what they could to make us comfortable. All this was much appreciated.Food was good as expected. Would definitely return
3
I ordered a duck main, which was about 30 Singapore dollars. I thought it was amazing and extremely tasty i was disappointed at how small the portions were. As food is extremely cheap in singapore i dont think it was worth that much as the local markets are just as nice and are $3-8 for a big meal. I also had an ice coffee which i thought was the most disgusting drink i have ever tried, definitely would not suggest getting the ice coffee. Over all i think their is much better options as singapore is the place to go for good food!!
4
The place is very well decorated and is a good place for gatherings or just have a slow and relaxing dinner. Service is good and waiters are able to recommend to you what is nice. Pasta taste is interesting (different from others) and is worth a try. May need to reserve a table in advance if you are coming as a group

My wife and I had breakfast at Jamie Italian and we were quite baffled that they did not offer much on the menu. Being among the only few restaurants that offered vegetarian breakfast options, we naturally wanted to experience the food here. We knew our options were limited but we were let down by the fact that you pay an exorbitant price for very little food. We were expecting quite a sumptuous breakfast for what we paid. The ambiance is very good, offering views of Sentosa and alfresco dining options. Wonder if we'd really visit this place frequently unless there are more options on the menu for vegetarians

We had high expectations about this restaurant. But the restaurant is badly run and something that management must seriously look at. We walked in at 3pm and asked for a table. Restaurant was 1/2 empty but when we told the lady at the door we didnt have a reservation, she hesitated as if there were no free tables and we couldnt eat there.We were seated, given menus but waited for atleast 20 minutes to be noticed by our waiter. During this time he gone to the table next to us with 2 girls 3 times. Anyway, he took our order, starters and mains. One starter comes out and straight away 3 of the 4 mains arrive. The 4th main arrived 5 minutes later, even though 2 of the mains were the same. Our other starter turned up as we finished our meal and the bread did not even turn up - maybe its still baking. Meanwhile our waiter never turned up to our table, never asked if we wanted more drinks or if everything was ok. He had no trouble going again to that same table next to us. Mean while the table next to them were calling for the manager and were complaining. I managed to get her attention ( sorry i missed her name) but she was real nice and sorry about everything. She said she was not the manager so i assumed she stepped up to take responsibility. She tried to make things right but our meal was ruined. While the food was great, a kitchen hand could follow Jamies recipes. I would definitely not go back and definitely not recommend anyone to go there. The place needs a clean up of staff and or managers in my opinion

Went to Jamie's Italian for my mum's 60th bday coz she's a big fan of His cooking show. First they sat us down just in front of the kitchen & It was extremely hot because of the heat lamps. We had to be asked to move. The food was hit & miss, inconsistent, some dishes like the truffle tagliatelle were really good but others just poor like the lobster Al forno. Lastly we had requested for a desert cake for my mum at the end & they served it to another birthday table. We had to request again after waiting for it for some time, and they did eventually get us one but the moment was gone. So not the 60th birthday celebrations we had hoped for. No wow factor at all

The food there was amazing but i do not think that a bowl of pasta would be that expensive. The last time i went there, there was not any pizza or risotto at all. Although food was good, i would recommend that there should be more choices on the menu

The Experience is the Brand. After this afternoon's lunch experience the Jamie Oliver brand is forever tainted in my mind. Never will I watch the shows with the same passion nor stop to look at the grocery store when I see one of their dips or pastas. I have experienced poor service in restaurants before but complete indifference and lack of any effort is what differentiates Jamie's Italian and puts in a completely different league. I will never be returning. It started with the laying of the table. For 3 adults and two kids, 3 sets of serviettes and silverware were laid out. After ordering our food, we asked for water, only 3 glasses appeared. So much of the holistic organic family feel for the brand. Its not just how you present stuff in organic looking jute and rustic wood that matters. My kids trying to reach out for the bread, spills my glass of prosecco into his plate. The waiter clearly sees this, looks and walks away. I clean up the table and call the waiter over and ask him for a new plate. Not even a pretence of trying to help, no offer to replace the serviette, not even an offer whether I would like to get another glass. As we are walking out my wife with my little one in the stroller leading the way, the same waiter opens the glass door walks in and lets the door slam almost into the stroller. Brilliant. Unfortunately, the food could not be the excuse for the snobbery and indifference of the staff. Mediocre at best. Pastas were way too rich and all we could taste was salt and the oil. The only saving grace for the food was the pasta which was well balanced and seasoned
3
The restaurant is nicely set up with a view of Sentosa, so the ambiance is good. The Olives and Prawn Linguini were both good, but the Carbonara was terrible. A huge pile of slightly undercooked Penne, with little sauce and almost no meat - couldn't even finish it. Service was average without any real interest in whether you enjoyed your food or not - pretty standard in Singapore. May give it one more go to see if improves, as I do like the menu and set-up
4
The only reason its a 4 not a 5 is our own fault to be fair. We sat outside to enjoy the view but realised that smoking is not banned in such a place. Next time will sit inside. I had the mushrooms in bread soooo unctuous. Plus the beetroot and walnut sale was wonderful. My husband had a steak cooked to perfection his only complaint was there wasn't enough of it (big kiwi boy!
5
Only popped in for a desert to top off our day. Ambience and menu pure Jamie. Have to go for a proper meal!
3
This is common in Singapore: all the drink after the first plate then an other plate etc ... No organisation at all about which order the things shall be served ..
5
Watching the activity of the Batam ferries coming and going while having a great meal. The staff is attentive, friendly and efficient and the food is great
3
Service was okay couple of little things that could be improved. The pasta was a little undercooked but when tried to explain to the waiter he just nodded and took the plates and walked off, The entrée was tasty and desert was okay but nothing spectacular (the pav) lacked cream a little dob of cream and that was it. Love Jamie and have been to a number of his restaurants and must say was a little disappointed.
4
Had dinner at Jamie's and the food was excellent with fresh ingredients and great flavour. Service was prompt and attentive. The quantity of food was less than expected though. No complimentary bread basket was also a minus point. Ambience is good. Would definitely recommend to check it out if you are around the area..
5
We love this place, that's it. Everything you order is great not just good. I have ordered different pasta dishes and they are all good. The py offer small and large portions. Order the large portion, it's not really large just enough. This place is a bit expensive compare to the other places in Vivo City.
5
The pasta was nice and fresh. The service however was the highlight of the evening. For example, at the start of the evening I requested to be moved away from the speakers as the music was loud. There were no other tables available but our server quickly apologised and proceeded to turn the music down for us. The food was also served quickly and the wait staff were attentive and polite throughout the evening. I only have positive things to say about the restaurant :) will be back for the service and foo
5
Atmosphere and food were fantastic! Cost was comparable with other restaurants in the area with a good selection of craft beers
4
checked out this place on a visit to Singapore- amazing food excellent choices and very very tasty. The choices are many and rates are reasonable
5
Food was great and the service made a lot of difference. Hazel was able to assist our big group(12 pax). She gave good food suggestions. Overall experience is great
5
We love Jamie Oliver so had high expectations. They were met that's for sure! Loved the kids menus on the viewfinders & plenty of healthy choices. The meals were delicious & good size servings. Was easily one of the best meals we had whilst in Singapore.
5
Staff were great and loved the food. Would go back for sure. If you love mushrooms get the wild mushroom risotto
1
We ordered 2 types of pasta, prawn linguine and porcini fettuccine. The prawn linguine was tasteless and the porcini fettuccine was undercooked with some fettuccine lumped together. The epic brownie was very sweet we had to waste 90% of it. At first, we were given main course spoon to eat our desert with! Is there no desert spoon? Finally, we were given coffee spoon after many attempts to get the waitress attention whose favorite tag line is "one second'. The lemon meringue cheesecake and gelato took forever to be served. This is the worst dining experience I ever had!!!!! I felt really bad because I was the one who recommended jamie Italian for our business function dinner that night under the expectation that it is a celebrity name that supposedly to command certain prestige. I will never recommend this place again
5
Great food. Good ambience. Altogether enjoyable expereience.Nice Wine collection. Attentive and smiling staff
3
When I and my friend passing by this place, we wonder to have a visit or not. After we take a look at the menu, Ok we decided to visit. I would like to try the Macchiato and my friend try the pasta. the macchiato is nice and my friend said the pasta is nice too. the staff is very friendly and nice, all over nice service. I like the ambience and they also has menu for kid
3
Huge disappointment with Jamie's Italian in Singapore. No atmosphere, so so service, no flavour in the dish. An overall boring experience...
4
We reserved for 12pax and we were seated next to the kitchen. Was quite warm. Our wait staff was really patient and friendly. It was a busy night but she was attentive to everyone's needs. Food was fresh and good, maybe, a tad bland for me. But that's just me because I'm used to eating saltier and spicier food
1
as a fans of jamie oliver, we were thrilled to go to jamie's last march, however our expectation shattered to pieces with the experience. first, our server is awfully rude, always ticking her fingers unpatiently while doing our orders ( i believe her name was selina). we ordered the aged steak (i forgot the name but its menu of the day) and its overcooked, the steak is rubbery and hard to chew, my husband's pasta is undercooked, its hard and dry,we were extremely dissapointed with the experience and feel sad because we are a huge fans of jamie oliver.definitely a no-go
5
Had dinner at Jamie's, everything was fantastic, the restaurant is busy but the staff seem to be able to cope well, the service was excellent with food being served piping hot, the pasta dishes were so flavoursome and cooked to perfection. nice to be in a restaurant where the staff make you feel special.
4
We liked all the freshness of the food we had ordered but the only downside was the food did not come together and the waiting time was a bit too long !Anyway, we did enjoy our meal though
5
We wanted to try Jamie’s in our home town in Australia but after wide spread complaints about waiting time we were surprised and happy to see Jamie’s in Singapore. We decided to eat at Jamie’s after visiting Sentosa Island when it might be a little quiet as we did not have a booking. We were pleasantly surprised that it was quiet in the afternoon and there was no line ups required. We also walked in on a special photo shoot of Jamie’s international executive head chef Marcos Georgious.The two waitresses were professional, attentive and friendly. I think one was new as she was getting training done but service was great. The food was wonderful, the tastes and flavours were superb. The restaurant décor is rustic and organic, everything that Jamie Oliver stands for. We would definitely recommend trying this branch of Jamie’s franchise if you are in town.To get to Vivo City, travel to HarbourFront station and go up the escalators to Vivo shopping centre
4
The food is what most people would expect of Italian cuisine, but the plating is what makes the difference. The restaurant serves dishes in a rather unusual style, and you may wonder what to eat first..! Jamie's fish is cooked in a not-so-familiar way, so check before you order.Food is rather pricey, but the ambience is warm and cosy, and the waiters are really friendly and helpful. Children even get a badge for eating their veggies!Remember to make a reservation days in advance
3
This is a fresh concept to Italian food. The dishes are vibrant and ingredients fresh. The restaurant is located in Vivo City, a busy mall in Singapore. The decor is unique and inviting and wholesomely Italian. I had prawn linguine and my wife ordered lamb chops. The linguine was spicy and rich. The lamb could have been rendered better and was chewy. The wine list is different and good. If you want a quick good meal then this is the place to go
5
Food was great. True to Jamie's reputation. Surprised that they didn't have pizza though. Planks were good for sharing but wasn't quite value for money. Staff were friendly and helpful. My dining party enjoyed ourselves. We were seated without much fuss. Great dining experience
4
This is my first visit since the restaurant opened last year. it was till buzzing with people despite the fact that we were there at 630pm. The venue is bigger than I thought. Interior decor of the shop is very unique, Pasta, antipasti, Mains and desserts.We went for the burger. It was it is mix of colours yet with a bit of the industrialised look for the tables. The alcohol prices are rather reasonable with quite a huge range of wines to choose from. Food menu is also extensive-with selection of huge! As the beef patty is minced meat, it can only be done in medium well. The taste of the burger is good. It is a better idea to share it and order something else on top of the burger. The dessert, Palova was a bit sweet. I am not a sweet tooth person, so maybe this is usual taste of how a Palova should be. Again, this dessert can be shared. Considering this restaurant is opened by a celebrity chef, the price is not too expensive. The bill came up to be SGD99 ( includes taxes, two glasses of wine, two mains and one dessert
5
Had a wonderful meal. Food was excellent and the service was one of the best we have had her in Singapore. The price of the meal was very very reasonable for Singapore. Love the venue
4
Ambience was lovely and food was overall good. The seafood planks were a bit kitch and the height of the tomato cans made it really uncomfortable to eat so I removed them, the food on the planks was good however sparse, probably need a starter to go with it and the meal was served a little tepid. Kids meals I order was the spaghetti, looked great however way too many herbs, the kids are not fussy eaters yet would not touch it. Overall nice experience
5
We had lunch at Jamie's Italian on a saturday lunch just before our movie at golden village. My partner had the Chicken Al Mattone and I had the Prawn Linguine. We have to agress that both were awesome! The pasta was cooked to al dente and the rockets were very fresh.The chicken was very tender and the lemony taste was so refreshing. But the portions were a tad bit small and we did find outselves snackin during the movie. Overall still 5 star
3
Was our first time & we were eager to try the place. Ambience was good. We had TagBolognese which was just average. The prime Sirlion was good with funky chips & rocket. I was thirsty the whole nite though as I suspect the food to be added with MSG. My wife felt the same. My lips felt dry even through the morning (me reaction to food with MSG)
3
Food portions were very small even for small eaters like us. We have to order a main dish and additional salad and appetisers to fill us up. The salad was disappointing as the dressing had a weird taste and tthe portion was so little we can count the number of leaves. The only plus point was the pasta that we had. Tasted great. Would have been a better experience if food portions can be increased for the amount we paid ($70/pax for salad, appetisers and pasta).
4
The ambiance was awesome, loved the decor and lighting of the restaurant.
Food was delicious. The Antipasti portions were too tiny though.
3
Sadly the food was very overpriced for pretty much standard Italian fare. The bruchetta is one slice of bread per price quoted (approx. SG$7.50). Overall serving sizes small for price. Also, somehow they served one person's main before serving anything else (including the entrées) and then took another 20-30min before anything else was served! And we had almost finished our mains when they finally brought out the "nachos" (entrée)! I wouldn't recommend anyone to go to this restaurant. There are plenty of other restaurants in Vivo City let alone in the rest of Singapore with better food, or food for price charged and even though our waitress was very lovely, no one tried to apologise for the strange serving order of the food
2
The restaurant is a big draw because of the name. The prices are also pretty reasonable.The service was also excellent here. The staff were falling over themselves to help.We have eaten at jamies in Australia and the UK and the food is delightful. Singapore, is unfortunately not.Hubby ordered at steak and I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli. Both were very sub standard meals. Hubby claimed his meat was very bland whereas my pasta was drowned in garlic. I couldn't taste anything else.Such a shame really as we didn't want to stay for anything else to see if the desserts were any good
2
The restaurant interior is without a doubt very nice and young untrained team tries hard. Food quality in Jamie's restaurants is usually very good, at least those we visited in Edinburgh, London and St. Petersburg. At the Singapore outlet however, the quality of food and service is less than average and therewith inappropriate to the prices charged. You get a much better quality of Italian food in most other Italian restaurants in Singapore. I work close to the restaurant and tried it now several times. We had Rigatoni Pomodori with undercooked pasta and a boring tomato sauce. no Parmesan offered. Then we had Primavera chicken the dish of the day. The chicken chewy, the skin far from crispy, all placed on some greens, which was swimming in a watery soup. a shared walnut salad was okay. with nothing else than a small sparkling water we paid 75 S$
1
Lamb rack was not marinated to remove a little of the overwhelming lamb taste (I am a lamb lover), prawn linguine not rich enough in tast
3
Was looking forward to try out this restaurant however i am definitely disappointed with the entire experience! Food was alright - Can't really judge as the restaurant had somehow forgotten about my main course despite the waitress repeating our order not once, but thrice! So all I had was some appetizers which are not that great to be frank. One of the waitress spilled red wine accidentally onto my friend's pants, what a surprise and my friend's handbag was flooded with wine as well.Service was alright - i guess everyone was shocked with the red wine incident however I have to praise the quick action and concern shown by other senior staff (thank you!). They serve us with a whole platter of dessert as compensation and I have to say that the dessert as definitely commendable.This place also has a good selection of drinks! Definitely worthwhile to come here for that but not for the food
4
Jamie's Italian is what you could expect from Jamie Oliver. Good and taste full food in a very nice setting. Not cheap though but it is value for money. Restaurant is very clean and tidy, servers are doing a great job. A must go to when shopping at Vivo City
1
What a disappointment. The flavours were bland. The meals arrived at odd times and portion sizes were not consistent. Despite numerous staff in the restaurant the waitress for our table had to frequently delay service due to an inefficient ordering and delivery system. The biggest disappointment however was the food. Jamie Oliver needs to revisit this restaurant to instil the full bodied flavours we expect from his recipes. Seasoning seems a thing of the past leaving dishes distinctly boring bland and flavourless. The vegetable plank advertised as loaded with mozzarella had one small quail egg sized ball. This restaurant must surely be surviving on reputation alone with such non descript fare on offer. Certainly not an experience I will be repeating. In future I will make my Jamie recipes at home from his world re known cookbooks
2
My last experience was excellent. Food was tasty, cooked to perfection, but service could be better. This time I had dinner at this restaurant. The place was crowded, dimly lit and extremely noisy. We ordered appetizers and pastas. The crab meet spagettini was the biggest disappointment. The pasta was over cooked and I couldn't any crab meat in the pasta. At SGD24.5 and with no crab meat (literally), I was very shocked. Since it was a birthday meal, i decided to not to complain. The pavlova is still my favourite, but the tiramisu falls very very short of expectation. Would I come again? Not after this experience. I can say for sure, even Jamie Oliver himself would not approve of the food served in this restaurant. This is an example of franchising gone wrong
2
The food was average... but surely not italian.Ok.. cheese and ham wasn't bad at all but even the cut wasn't appropriate
3
Pros:
Upmarket image, attentive staff.
Cons:
Average food for a premium price. Crowded and noisy. Asked for a glass of water and was served a 0.5L bottle for SGD 11.
4
I had a great start to the evening. I ordered a glass of wine at just past 7pm, the waiter offered me the happy hour price - it's always nice to be surprised by such a gesture.The crispy squid appetizer had fried garlic flakes and a light tasty dip, very nice. The crab&avocado bruschetta came with 2 delicious dips - hummus & guac. The portions were really small so we were a bit apprehensive when we asked for small size pastas (there was a choice of large or small serving).Unless you are really hungry, go for the small size one - it's a large enough portion for one person. But I gotta say, out of the 2 pastas we ordered, one (the prawn linguine, hailed as one of the house's favorites) was quite a letdown. The sauce was heavy and with too much tomato, the linguine was a bit under cooked for my liking. I gave the feedback to the waiter who very gracious returned it to the kitchen.Talking about size, the tiramisu was a whopper but I was not complaining - it was amply moist with a coffee liqueur, I thourough enjoyed it.Except for the itsy bitsy appetizers (quite uncharacteristic of Jamie Oliver), I would say the overall experience was what I have expected of Jamie's Italian
4
I couldn't believe I found such a good Italian restaurant in Asia. As I saw lamb on the menu nothing could stop me to get in and luckily we only had to wait for few minutes to get the table even we didn't have reservation. My meal was excellent, one of the best lambs I've ever tasted. My mom wasn't as lucky with the pasta meal she ordered. Taste was very mild and I wouldn't even call it average by quality. So not all the meals were great. Tiramisu as a dessert was pretty good though. Atmosphere was nice and casual. It was enjoyable meal we had there, even not the perfect for all of us
3
Visited this restaurant with so much expectation. Especially with the big name behind it. It was for Sunday lunch and we were looking forward to our meal. The baked mushrooms were a decent starter. The polenta fries really didn't have any flavor. The mains took ages to come. They were busy but you would expect them to be able to come. I had the lamb chops with the bone-in which was utterly disappointing. No flavor at all and the chops were thin and overcooked. The only thing that was similar to Jamie Oliver was the way it was served which was on a wooden plank. My wife's pasta was bland without much flavor too. Overall Singapore is a city with high standards in food. This was by far the worst meal I had here in the last three days. Jamie's restaurant is in need of Gordon Ramsey's 'Hell's Kitchen' for a urgent makeover. No pun intended
5
Even if the menu had standard Italian fare, the ingredients were fresh. We went on a busy Saturday night but had made prior reservations weeks in advance! The ambience could have been perfect if not for the place being full. They have excellent staff and superb service. My daughter was spoiled by our server Leila who even sliced up her pork chop meal for her. Little thoughtful gestures do go a long way.Food was excellent, dessert was heavenly! I will definitely go back there on my next visit to Singapore
4
Just in case you are wondering, yes, this IS the famous restauarnt by Jamie Oliver himself, right in Singapore itself. Okay, so it has been around for a while, but the crowd-avoiding me refused to visit during periods of long queues and rushed eating slots. I finally got to eat at Jamie's Italian recently, thanks to the SIL for the suggestion and lovely treat.For mains, the SIL went for the Wild Mushroom and Smoked Mozarella Risotto (SGD$16.00 for small). If you are a mushroom lover, this dish would be perfect for you - filled with mushroom goodness; every bite was filled with the crunch of mushrooms and its rich velvety flavour. The acquerello rice grains were to a tautness, retaining the chewy texture.As for me, I chose the Octopus & Mussel Spaghetti (SGD$16.00 for small) - pasta nero with mussels and baby octopus, chilli and white wine. The pasta was a little on the hard side - I wonder if their pasta here is supposed to be on the more solid side? But I love my pasta this texture - chewy. The gravy was awesome, a touch of spice and full-bodied flavor in the gravy that complemented the fresh seafood items well.It was truly the art of using simple ingredients to create sumptuous pasta, and we enjoyed every morsel of food here. I would be back to try more, soon!For full review and more detailed information, please refer here thanks:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/04/dinner-at-jamies-italian-restaurant.htm

Food - I've been here a few times now. Generally it is good eg. Plank entrees and canoli but I had the tuna fusilli and it was very ordinary. The cinnamon in it was odd. I developed a stomach cramp later. Tiramisu fans need to know that the layers are like cake rather than the savoiardi biscuits.Service - also generally good, especially if you get the managers, but tonight one waiter was clearly a newbie and couldn't answer a basic menu question. We had to wave for attention Also, one waiter leaned over my guest to serve food rather than moving around to the other side of the table. Very awkward. Value - depends if it is a good or bad day at Jamie's! Atmosphere - casual, comfortable. The benches in front of the kitchen / food pick up area is rather warm.
3
Went here with high hopes as I have been a fan of Oliver for many years. Was expecting the dishes to have a bit of a punch, but no. Not very special and just kind of an average Italian. We were a group of 6 sharing all the dishes so there was lots of variety. Fried calamari was probably my favorite and that's not a dish worth going back for. Also ordered a 2012 Red and a 2013 arrived. Sorry, but won't go back.
4
We've been there for dinner a few times. It is great to sit outside and enjoy the view on the terrace. The appetizers are nice, but they never bring them out at the same time. Sometimes they bring all the dishes out together. We've found the trick though: we only order appetizers, wait till they are served, then order the rest. In fact, that's how you should order in most places in Singapore. Regarding the food at Jamie's, you can order it in small or large portions, but tbh the large portions aren't really that much bigger that the small ones, so I feel they could add more, as otherwise it does err on the pricey side for what you get. Other than that, everything tastes great
4
We dined here in the evening looking out over the bay and it was a lovely experience.Our aubergine bake was very good.I was however very surprised to be told that they did not have a washroom or anywhere to wash hands. We had to walk into the shopping mall to use their public toilets.The restaurant isnt small and it should have a toilet/washroom for its customers.I was told that Jamie Oliver has visited his restaurant just once since it opened. Perhaps in light of the unfavourable reviews he should check it all out for himself. His reputation is at stake. Having said that we did enjoy our visit
1
The only thing they didn't muck up was the wine. And even taking the cork out was a battle. Service was awful, slow, forgetful, and had to be asked more than once for things. Food was below par and I wouldn't go back.
3
The food was okay but the service is a little slow (but okay). The waiters were pretty friendly. They even made the effort to ask if we are enjoying our food. Overall the standard of food is not exactly tip top but it wasn't that bad either. Of course, there are better Italian food in Singapore
5
Our first time at a Jamie's restaurant. We saw it on our walk back through the centre after our big day at universal studios, we approached the menu board and saw the prices were very reasonable so we decided to eat there that night. With no reservation on what see,ed to be a rather busy night we were seated within 15 min and had ordered, for a restaurant as busy as it was we expected maybe a 25 min wait for food, NO under 10 min witch is some of the best service I have had in a while. The food was perfect fresh and just done right!!!! For both of us it was $72 for dinner witch included the 10% service charge. Defiantly will be back and highly recommend
3
Just average. Service a bit slow. Waiters don't seem to notice you. Food average. But this is Singapore and there are lots more (better) alternates. Even next door in the same building. Jamie needs to come back and make this place "pukka" or pull down his name.
2
First visit last year was a let down (food was just not delicious - we had fish and steaks) and we thought we returned, hoping it would be better. The pasta mains were not good - the pasta was rather uncooked and the sauces, one was crab which was 'fishy' and the other prawn linguine, was too sour. We had a side of salad which was below average. It's not cheap and you wish the staff would be a lot more engaging, given JO's appeal to all in the family. Didn't bother with the desserts. Very disappointing. Jamie, please do something
1
So many bad feedback and you guys still go ? Maybe you want to donate to JO who obviously doing anything abt the standards. I visited the restaurant and witness an arguement between a customer from China and the manager. Her pasta had uncooked meat. I left without even trying the food there. Had dinner in another nearby restaurant. Not going back
2
The food was below average and servers are constantly running around that they do not have any time to take a look at you. Always remember to make reservation, otherwise prepare to receive the condescending tone of the maitre'd asking you to wait for 1 hour at least.Lastly, if you managed to get in, never ever sit near the kitchen. The blazing heat bulb will give you a wonderful uneven tan
3
I went to this restaurant with great expectations - afterall it's Jamie Oliver's! And guess what - I was surprisingly disappointed. The food was average to above average, the ambience was average to above average and the cutlery, plates and glass and everything they served on was surprisingly below average! What??? I was quite disappointed to say the least for the $$$ you pay and the branding they have, it's not a place to go back to. Probably Jamie needs to come back to this restaurant and take some feedback from people and renovate this place - seriously pulling his name down. We ordered a mozzarella salad and it was nice and tasty, but the pastas we ordered were just about average. I mean, I've had food at several other `ordinary' Italian restaurants, which tasted much better. it was nice to see them bring some paper and crayon for the kid to draw and keep them engaged. nice thought. For the $$$ you pay, this place isn't worth it
1
My family and I spent the evening, making an reservation to have dinner here. When we arrived, the hostess greeted us and escorted us to our table. She gave the kids a coloring kit as well. Once we sat down, after 10 minutes of wait time, we realized no wait staff or server came over to assist us. We had no water and just stared at our kids coloring set. We kept asking and most wait staff just said, one second. The place wasn't packed. We there at 6pm on February 18, 2015. After 15 more minutes, enough is enough. We asked for a waiter, and along comes this guy. He was slamming the water pitcher and giving us a pissed off look. I'm not sure what troubled him that evening, but I'm sure we didn't do anything wrong. We didn't even speak to anyone. After that attitude, I immediately asked for the manager on duty that evening. It was a lady. She didn't tell me her name, she also said the waiter wasn't upset or showing any signs of anger. She offered us to have another server, but my emotions are so worked up. Orginally, we were suppose to have a fun night with the family and now everything is ruin because the long wait without any service and waiter showed his frustration at us! The manager said if we didn't feel comfortable, we can leave. I can't believe she said that. What establishment will offer such an option to their customer? I asked the manager for a name card, she knew she messed up and she gave us a blank business card with no names. I asked her for her name and she walked away ignoring me. I didn't want to cause any scenes. At the end, there is another restaurant directly across from this place. It was Poulet. We end up having a spectacular meal and excellent service. Maybe we were so mistreated, even if a person walked up and smile at us, we would be satified. Either way, I really hope Jamie Oliver will see this review and also re-evaluate the staff running this restaurant. It's customer like us that will never return to this establishment ever again

Singapore is expensive. Period. No exception at Jamie's. We ordered two rump steaks and a child's portion of pomodoro carbonara. The steaks were cooked as ordered. They were pretty on the plate with their sides, but they were bland. The coleslaw that came with it was in a sweet yogurt sauce. I was not aware prior to going there that Jamie likes to mix things up with his dishes. After learning that, the coleslaw made sense. It wasn't terrible it just wasn't that good. It tasted like plain yogurt with cabbage in it. The french fries were very good. As for the pomodoro, I was told that the child's size was quite small, and that a full size should be ordered. Ordered the smaller size anyway. The child size was much bigger than I was told. It tasted good, but as others have said, the pasta was not quite cooked. It was pre-al dente. The sauce was rich enough with bits of bacon in it. Toward the bottom the sauce had a bit of black pepper kick to it. We also ordered the bread combo. It too was like everything else...OK. Nothing to rave about for sure, especially for the price. For three people it was $85 SGD without any drinks or dessert

This was a 2.nd chance to right a not so great 1.st visit in the first half year after it opened. Blaming it on the hype and expectations following the opening we were ready to have dinner there again.The menu has changed slightly but the food was still very good. From what we ordered the most impressive were the crab & avocado bruschetta, cauliflower & parmesan fritters (out of this world yummy...), tagliatelle Bolognese (very good sauce and it was lapped off the plate with bread till the very last bit), crab spaghettini (the pasta could've been done a bit more...), wild mushroom & smoked mozzarella risotto and the creamy panna cotta as dessert.So food wise nothing really to complain about, even the 15 months old toddler had a feast.But oh oh oh you would definitely expect much more from the service in an establishment where you do pay $$$.Making the reservation was rather impressive with a call back on the day itself and a reconfirmation of all requests.As we were inviting overseas relatives for a birthday dinner treat, we asked the manageress Sarah whether it was possible to hold our credit card for payment as we know that the friends would want to pay for it. Sarah explained that they were unable to hold the card but that they have some sort of a safe where they can keep the card in and you will be given the key to it.We urged her to make sure that it was our card which had to be used for the payment and not to accept any from the relatives. Sarah ensured me that she will inform the server who attended to our table.Having full confidence in what was being told we sat down and started our lovely get-together with good food. However the service was simply way below par for a "Jamie's".We were still enjoying our appetizers and hadn't finished when the mains arrived.The plates from the ones who already finished their mains were taken away so that the ones still eating felt rushed. Having a toddler at the table means all went slower than maybe was the norm.After we ordered our desserts and various coffees it took 2 more request (with at least 10 mins in between each request) for that last cappuccino to finally arrive.Anyway when it was time for the payment one of the relatives apparently caught hold of one of the servers and paid the bill to our utter astonishment.I approached Sarah on our way out and told her about it. Her response was that she informed our server but the relative caught hold of another server who wasn't informed. We were attended by 3 (!!) different servers in the first place and secondly there should've been a note/remark for our table so that any server getting the bill would be able to see/read it.This was so so embarrassing, the one supposedly being treated for the birthday ended up paying for the dinner !! Sad to say, there are definitely better Italian restaurants with far better service in Singapore but "Jamie's Italian" will continue to thrive on Jamie Oliver's name..

My husband and I are regulars. He is Italian so he knows what he is eating. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere. It is always packed. Reservation is recommended.The food is very good in relation to the price. Some dishes are better than the other but mostly they are authentic and well cooked. Don't expect something very sophisticated as a lot of people who are not used to Italian food might expect. I would recommend it for an evening out with friends, family and dates

I went recently with my family and must say was excited to try. Firstly I musty say the service team is excellent and very friendly and the kids menu ideas and gifts to keep them happy during dinner are great even the feel and ambiance is nice however ..... When you go for dinner it is about the food. Undercooked pasta , Unripe tomatoes , mozzarella so small that raisins are bigger left the dinner disappointing and the family saying they wish they had rather gone to Trapizza on Siloso beach or Modestos on the roof of Vivo.If you want to try the brand and have money to spend in a dinner where you leave hungry and not satisfied then this is the right choice.

My husband and I used to go Jamie's Italian when we were living in Sydney and it was always an amazing experience. We loved when we found out there was a Jamie's Italian in Singapore. We got an outside table with a view to the harbour - had a great glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo along with delicious crab and avocado bruschetta. For main we had wild mushroom & smoked mozzarella risotto and penne pomodoro. For desert, the one and only tiramissu with a twist of orange. It's is a definetly a go whenever you are in Singapore

Visited this nice place along the waterfront in Singapore near Sentosa which is a great "amusement park". The atmosphere is very relaxed, you can dine out or under cover (no need to every be worried about cold weather). The drinks were ample and the food was just excellent! The waitstaff just does everything in their power to see to it that you feel like you are welcome (not always the case in Singapore)
1
One word. Bad. I ordered carbonara, changed the Penne to Linguine. It arrived dry, noodles hard, undercooked, as if they cooked it long ago and just microwaved before serving us. Not worth for the S$22. Any restaurant can serve better cooked pasta. Not coming back again.
3
we have been here at least 4 times, because the genius that Jamie is, my daughter reads the menu from a viewer toy, she colours and gets a Jaimie's kitchen sticker and they have kids salad in a little shake me up jar, it's pretty slick. The food on the adult menu is pricey but hey this is Singapore. It is consistent, unfortunately so is the terrible service. In all the times we have been here I have yet to see the service be prompt, polite or have them remember the order or to come back and see us once or to retrieve the bill. It gets a mid range review from me , sorry Jamie, better check the staff performance.
2
Located along the water in front of Sentosa. The terras outside is nice. However here ends the good part.Food with funny tastes. Nothing was fresh with the exception of the salad. Not a real Italian. They try to be special but fail. Service was bad! Better not to bring children because they do not like children. We had in this one visit of 90 minutes two incidents where they clearly do not accept children to be children.The service turns around those who serve, not the customer! Will never go again! Singapore has much better Italian

Jamie's is near my office, so we went there once a month for busienss lunch/dinners. Summaryzing what I had eaten there:Appetizers - planks were over-rated, crab bruschetta not worth it. The fried calamari was decent. But simple things like olives, apple slaw are goodMains - ordered lamb lollipops 2-3x over last few months with mixed results. Two times, the meat was over-rested and came to the table cold. But once they get it right, the lambs were great and succulent. The artichoke puree was very goodMy favourite mains is acqua pazza. Had both seabass and snapper, and liked them both. The cooking is simple with olive oil, wine, olives, tomatoes and herbs but the dish is very flavourful. Pastas - typically goodDesserts - ordered a few items and nothing worth shout about
4
This is an excellent place if you like to be a connoisseur to enjoy certain drinks. The staff is willing and helpful in explaining the details be this of drinks or the meals. They are very efficient. We were given JI vouchers to go and eat here. The food we ordered was ok. Somehow, we had remembered it tastier from our past visit, but still we enjoyed our visit, watching the many comings and goings, while the staff was all smile. Fun for families, fun for drinks, fun for conversations
4
The service was fast and efficient. The set lunch was quite a ok and it was priced at $17.90++. Atmosphere is good and busy with office crowd and tourists.
3
OK - So the honeymoon is over - and we've finally succumbed to visiting JI's for dinner. Hmm...Our started was shared between two of us and was FAB (maybe we were both hungry)...the calamari was crisp and the aioli dip tasty ...but for $11.50 we were expecting a bit more calamari. Our mains - well...I think the kitchen forgot about us - or our server did. We rarely saw him after he delivered the starter - what's up with that? Had the bolognaise - tasty but on the dry side - and NOT piping hot...so a bit more sauce please. My dining partner had the carbonara - not hot (temperature) either, though it was tasty. We were expecting better food and much better service. There were ALOT of wait staff / personnel roaming around but not necessarily providing service that I could see. I think the staff and food quality need an overhaul. There are better Italian restaurants in Singapore
2
5 of us ordered various pastas, meat and sides to share.Out of the 5 pastas, only 1 was considered average (I believe it was called truffle.....). The other 4 were below average (don't remember what they are).The beef was much better than the pasta and we actually ordered it again after we finished the first plate. Sides were nothing to shout about too. Will not return again
3
Overall the food is average and seems to be trying too hard to be different....the chips for example are covered in garlic and taste awfull. I had a burger that was ok but really nothing special.The location in the mall is good and the design is nice. Price a bit high but i guess thats all about the name
4
Awesome lively atmosphere together with mouth- watering fare, makes Jamie's Italian a place you want to visit and revisit! The children have a whale of a time, while we adults enjoy the food Have come here on my earlier Singapore trip & will do so, next time around as well
3
I was expecting to get mind blown, it is Jamie Oliver's after all. A couple of friends recommended I must go there, so I did. Was really disappointed, ordered an appetizer, burger and pasta. The appetizer was nice, the burger and pasta were really really really so ordinary, I mean the kind of burger and pasta you could get anywhere CHEAP. Nothing special.And the $$$ wasn't worth something too normal like that. Will give it another try anyway
3
Lovely location in Vivo shopping centre and we were seated at a room with a nice ocean view. A well-balanced if slightly pricey menu – my starter of crab and avocado bruschetta was light, tangy, beautifully balanced and thoroughly delicious. What I got didn’t seem to correspond completely with the menu description but the only complaint I had was that there was not enough of it (particularly when priced at $14.5) and would happily have polished off at least one more piece of Bruschetta – the avocado which I had expected to be a key part of the dish was a largely decorative puree on the slate.On, the other hand, my main course of honeycomb canelloni three ways (spinach and ricotta, aubergine and sun-dried tomato, pumpkin) was a very generous portion. It was dominated by the ricotta and I found little flavour of sundried tomato or aubergine. The selection of breads was good but both of us found the Balsamic and Olive oil dip too sweet. Tagliatelle Bolognese was excellent but strangely, and in contrast to the cannelloni the portion was a little on the small side. Overall a good, filling and tasty lunch option, if a little pricey. A friend later told me I should have opted for the set lunch menu which is better value, but if this option exists the staff never made us aware of it
5
Family dinner on Christmas was wonderful here. Everyone enjoyed their meal and the service was great as well. I had Truffle Tagliatelle Pasta which I would highly recommend! Loved the ambiance, ate inside although the patio is scenic, it looks out on the harbour. Would definitely come back again as it is very affordable for such a high-end menu. Quality of food is impeccable
2
Called twice in separate days to make a reservation for 8 people. Staff promised to call me back to confirm but never did. Highly unprofessional, as you're expected to change your schedule to suit them. I ended up waiting until the day of the dinner and, having heard absolutely nothing, from the restaurant, I made a reservation and dined elsewhere.

Perfectly Al Dente!Having read some bad reviews about how expensive this place was and how simple the dishes, we didn't expect much. However we still came just to give Jamie's a fair chance, and most importantly to try a new place and be the judge. We arrived on a week day just before 12 noon and was quickly whisked to a table overlooking the water. We watched boats pass by as we waited for food. Food: we ordered Prawn linguini, Aubergine parmigiana, simple salad. All fresh and delicious. Aubergine came with fresh bread rolls topped with herbed butter. Even the simple cherry tomatoes was transformed into beauties by the perfect dressing. We ordered small serving of pasta and we like that there is an option for petite portions. Linguini was perfectly al dente, just enough yummy sauce to generously coat each strand and some spare to dip the bread in, and topped with fresh rockets drizzled with thinly shredded cheese. That was pasta haven in a plate and it was quickly consumed. That comment came from a non pasta fan who usually could not finish even a small pasta dish.Service was prompt and polite. Retro interior was charming. Price is on the high side but we consider it fair for the food quality, pleasant service, and good location with waterfront view. Extra observations: 1. Salad dressing was served in small and pretty jars. Such attention to details did not escape us. 2. Prawn was shelled and deveined. Fantastic. 3. We spotted some cute bread bouquets that looked appetizing but did not order it. Leave it for our next visit. 4. We chose to wash down all the good Italian cooking with over-priced sparkling water that came in a poofy glass bottle so pretty that we asked to bring home to be recycled into flower vase. Hopefully there will be an option for cheaper alternative, like San Pelegrino Limon?5. Waitress interrupted our meal by asking how was the food. This was unnecessary and disturbing as it's impossible to reply when your mouth is bursting with aubergine. We think this is pleasantries could be avoided. If food was not good you will know about it anyway from Trip Advisor ;-)Verdict: WE SHALL RETURN

There are many considerably better Italian restaurants in Singapore. This food is boring, I honestly think I could cook better at home. The portion sizes are small for the price. The location is the only good part of this place because the view is ok.

We have been to several Jamie's the UK so know what to expect. However we came to Singapore after a few weeks in Perth. We went to Jamie's there and it was a disastrous meal with below average service. We wanted to se if standards had slipped here. Quite the opposite in fact. The staff were so welcoming and attentive and you could see they meant to look after you. I would go so far as to say they were proud of their job. The meals we had were up to and beyond anything else we had had at Jamie's before. My wife has prawn linguine and I really fancied a burger. The linguine was beautiful and full of tasty prawns. The burger was the best I have ever had at Jamie's.I kept hold of the receipt where I had the name of the waitress and also took the name of the lovely girl who served the drinks. We will pass the good service on to Jamie's site the same as we passed the opposite about Perth. Well done Singapore, you outshone the British
1
Having been to many of Jamie's Italian in the UK, I expect it to be at least near to the standard that I used to. However, it turned out to be extremely disappointing for me and my friends. I must say I am a regular in Jamie's Italian in UK as a Gold Card member, but I don't see myself or my friends going back to Jamie's at Vivo. I ordered lamb chop lollipops as this is one of my favourite dish in Jamie's Italian UK, but it turned out to be something different and the taste was just bland. A friend ordered their 'Today's special' which was Pasta Seafood Marinara, which the spaghetti turned out to be soggy. The appearance didn't look appeal and taste like it was out of microwave oven, not freshly prepared. My other friend's risotto and meatball pappardelle were equally bad. In addition, our starter, crispy squid, were not that crispy when served, compared to the piping hot ones I had in UK. Leave aside the food, service was not as prompt for their service crew, except the guy who seemed to be the manager/supervisor. With the price we pay (not cheap) we expect better service and of course, the quality Jamie's Italian food. I must say again, I would not try any other Jamie's Italian apart from those in the UK (my favourite is in Glasgow)
2
After my first disappointing dinner at Jamie's Italian, decided to try to have lunch to give the restaurant another try. However, the poor and snobbish attitude of the staff turned us off and we eventually decided not to dine at Jamie's at all.At 2.30pm in the afternoon, despite the restaurant looking to be half full with several empty tables, the staff at the entrance told me I had to wait for 10-15minutes to be seated (for 3 adults and one baby). Feeling incredulous, I asked her again why I had to wait, her reply was: ma'am you just have to wait. we do not have any available tables now. and she was not even apologetic. Unlikely to recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are numerous other better options available in vivocity

Planned a light lunch with my friend on a weekday afternoon The restaurant is located along the water walk of Sentosa where there is other beautiful restaurant locatedFOOD The order was of asparagus brucetta and for the mains we orders salmon pasta and clams and octopus choice All the three dished were outstanding and freshness of the food and dishes were clearly felt in every bite SERVICE Reading some of the past reviews on the tripadvisor I was not sure with the service standards but to my surprise it was excellent , the order was served taken on time and served in sequence of course as requested which is very important The only point I want to highlight here is when we entered i requested that can I be seated outside to which I was told that outside seating is closed for the afternoon. But after half an hour I saw a couple being seated outside which really annoyed me but I never told this point to manager because I wanted to keep my afternoon. Nice

Before you step into this place, be prepared to pay more than double than any Italian restaurants in town, keeping in mind that Jamie Oliver's franchise fee won't come in cheap anyway.Once you've settled this psychologically, you know the food and service here won't be disappointing.I have a soft shell crab as starter. The crab came out tasty and not oily. The salad at the bottom was very well seasoned and marinated.The spaghetti marinara was the special of the day. The taste is similar to those you'd expect in a fine dining restaurant in Milan or Rome, distinctly freshly cooked with best ingredients.I tried the seafood "plank" and it was a selection of cured salmon, deep fried fish and other steamed seafood. Well presented and tasty. For dessert, I had the best pavlova ever!Overall the place really live up to my expectation of a Jamie Oliver restaurant. The lunch cost SGD85 per person!Two minor suggestions:1) the restaurant seems under-staffed. They should recruit more waiters to pay better attention to customers. There was also a waitress that speaks incomprehensible English, suggest they don't let her serve English speaking customers. 2) they keep asking me how was the food. It was to a point irritating When I make some minor negative remarks, the waiter just ignored me and walk away. I think they were just trying to fish for complement. I suggest they should stop doing that unless they are sincere to get feedback on the food or service.Overall, I recommend this place if budget is not the issue and you are looking for good food and good dining experience
5
Went here for lunch as we are JO fans and we weren't disappointed. Great service, pasta cooked perfectly and a chocolate brownie to die for what more do you need
4
we went to get some lunch during our shopping time and ordered some crab Bruschetta , meat balls and crab spaghetti and cheesecake along with a a jug Italian Lemon( the jug was greatly over priced at $18 ++) other wise its what we expected from Jamies, service was goo
5
My wife and I really enjoyed ourselves tonight. This was our first visit to one of Jamie Oliver's restaurants and it was as we had hoped. Great food, friendly efficient staff and a fun and relaxed atmosphere.. Well worth the visit
5
Of all the celebrity restaurants that I've been to, this is the most homey so far. The food feels like it's cooked at home, not to flashy and you can adjust the salt and pepper to your taste. We ordered the aged prime rib (my favorite), rump steak, burger, lamb chops, linguini and spaghetti. The octopus taste in the spaghetti was very powerful though. Ambiance and service are good and the food are picture perfect
4
Dropped into Jamies for what was going to be a light lunch however we went mad on the menu and ended up with the works, food was good quality and plentiful and what one would expect. The location for this restaurant is excellent as outside seating looks over the harbour to Sentosa Island and is part of the harbour board walk, very nice for a night time dinner after shopping in Vivo City mall
5
Sorry for the late review. We had an amazing holiday in October I took my wife to Jamie's Italian in Vivo city for a surprise dinner for her 50th. We had the most amazing time ever the meal was awesome the staff was awesome We couldn't fault it at all. Then at the end of dinner they bought me a plank out with Happy Birthday in chocolate written over it with the dessert amazing. So thank you guys at Jamie's for making our trip amazing. Hope to see you in 2015 oh one more thing thanks to Jerome who took time out of his busy restaurant to wish my wife a happy birthday
5
I surprised my wife with a celebration meal for her 50th Birthday at Jamie's restaurant at Vivo city Singapore I was truly over whelmed how the evening went they bent over backwards to ensure my wife will never forget her day. The meal was superb got lots of pictures to prove it lol.thank you to all staff excellent night xxx please go and visit this place you will not be disappointe
4
One of our favorite joints for lunch. Love the olives on ice. The olives are never sour (so far at least), they have a nice taste and texture. For olive lovers, this appetizer is a must.I ordered the Italian burger with funky chips (fries as it turns out). The burger was not to my expectation. The beef patty was a little over cooked, which made it not juicy at all. There is a topping of bacon and crispy onions which didn't really go well and made the entire dish dry. Could have been better
4
The choices were limited but all that was ordered was done very well. We liked that there was a kids menu available. The taste is different from traditional Italian
3
I was really looking forward to eat here ! On the whole the service was really good and attentive and for Singapore that's saying something as most places I go too the main problem is service ! No one serves with a smile or pays attention to the order ! The waiters were attentive and friendly ! We went for the vongole and bruschetta - it's okay but nothing special ! It has nothing to do with real Italian cooking unfortunately The pasta was way to aldente and the sauce lacked the bang ! The bread was way to dry Won't visit the place again The decor
2
Stopped at Jamie Oliver's for a drink and possibly lunch. When the server came over we ordered two glasses of wine, and water. We told her we were undecided on lunch and would keep a menu to look it over. A different server brought our wine. We never got our water. And no one ever came back to take our lunch order. We noticed several other people "flagging down" servers to get their attention. When we were ready to leave - and find somewhere to go for lunch - we had to get up from the table and walk over the server station to get a bill. Too bad. I expected much more
1
Decided to give Jamie's Italian a try after hearing about all the hype surrounding it, but my friends and I left the restaurant sorely disappointed.The prawn linguine regrettably did not live up to its name. The tomato sugo was too one dimensional, as the basil, chilli and fennel were overpowered. The prawns, though well cooked, lacked the fried garlicky flavour as promised in the menu. Thankfully, the pasta was cooked al dente.A friend of mine got the octopus and mussel spaghetti and it hit us as pasta in brine. We could not pick up the piquant taste of capers nor the fragrance of white wine. Another had the steak and she pointed out that the steak was mistakenly sliced parallel to the grain, which resulted in a hard time chewing.Given the culinary excellence associated with the founder of this restaurant chain, we agreed that this meal fell far from expectations and we hope that this was an aberration rather than the norm
3
The food is outstanding while the service is very poor the manger and a few staff members where good exposing the menu to us but 23 after we had finished are meal the tables where finally cleared
5
We tried out their Christmas special - a selection of antipasti on a plank, main course of angus sirloin and duck leg, and the dessert plank. Every selection absolutely fantastic, the angus sirloin simply amazing, and superb set of dessert with creamy panna cotta with fruit compote, lemon meringue cheese cake simply outstanding
4
I was there last Monday. Crowded. Food was good. The best was the desserts. Expensive meal. A place for celebration
3
Went there for dinner. Although it was crowded but food wise it's just average. I wouldn't go there again. Not worth the money
4
We accidentally came across the restaurant when we were walking around the mall. As a fan of Jamie Oliver and having none of his restaurant in Malaysia, we decided to give it a try. Our server was lovely and recommended dishes to try. We had the small portions of pasta so that we could try more variety, salad, and 2 drinks which came to about SGD 80. They served us drinking water from the jug that was on the house but we could tell for westerners, they offered sparking or stilled water which was chargeable as our next table quickly noticed and changed. Possibly my expectations were high as we found the food normal and nothing to shout about. The only thing was that we could tell our friends that we went to Jamie Oliver's Italian
1
I had waited for over a month to try this restaurant, as I am a big fan of Mr. Oliver’s TV programmes. Waiting another 45 minutes for a table didn’t seem like too much to ask. I wasn’t very hungry, and was looking for something light, like soup or a small salad. The first thing that struck me was the menu – it’s one page, printed on both sides and one entire side is devoted to alcoholic drinks. There are beverages listed on the other side as well, so basically 60% of what’s on offer is liquid. I am suspicious of places that spend more effort on their booze than on their food. Everything looked pretty heavy and involved, so when I didn’t see anything particularly appetizing on the menu I asked the waitress and were told they never have soup – which I found surprising in an “Italian” restaurant. No minestrone? Not even for a daily special? The description of their salads left me uninspired, but my husband ordered their Prawn Linguini and the kids got fish fingers and chicken skewers. The food arrived quickly but once everyone dug in I was glad I didn’t force myself to get something I didn’t want. The chicken pieces on the skewers were covered in “mixed seeds” – basically bird food, which added nothing but detracted from the meat and was a real turn off to the child. (This WAS from the kids’ menu afterall…) My son’s fish fingers were fine, but accompanied by a lemony yoghurt something, that in no way resembled tartar sauce. Both children’s meals came with a small bowl of raw vegetables under unidentified greens. Did they think they could hide them? Under more greenery??? Even my husband’s pasta was unsatisfactory. I know what a prawn is and these weren’t it – they were small shrimp and the sauce was some sort of tasteless tomato juice derivative. Things went form bad to worse when we asked for ketchup for the undercooked fries. I thought it was weird it came portioned out in a shallow bowl. When my 4 year old spit it out and tried to wipe it off his finger into his hair I knew something was really amiss. I started to admonish him – until I tasted it myself. Something strange was going on because that WAS NOT ketchup. I called the waitress over and she explained it was tomato sauce. Unseasoned tomato sauce. I asked again for ketchup and was met with a blank stare. In a few moments the manager was at my table, unbidden, asking what was wrong and how he could correct things. What was wrong was that in an effort to promote healthy eating, Mr. Oliver and his executive chef had taken all the joy out of dinner. Much like Weight Watchers from the 1970’s, the menu planners here removed every vestige of flavor and texture from their offerings, so determined were they to make eating a feat of moral rectitude. I tried to explain – this was a 4 year old, with a narrow palate and limited tolerance for change. The manager asked if perhaps he could substitute a different (no doubt equally boring and inedible) entrée? I applaud their efforts, but really, 2 T of Heinz ketchup would have improved the dish before him immeasurably. Would that be so hard? I ask Mr. Oliver and his chef, did removing the salt and 15 calories of sugar from my child’s condiment improve his diet that much? No. But it did make him further distrust and despise ‘healthy eating’ and run screaming even faster in any direction away from those veggies that you tried to foist on him. I get it – I really do. Remember? I watch all your shows. We all need to eat more vegetables. But healthy eating, like ANYTHING ELSE, can be well or poorly executed. This was clearly the latter, and pushy about it at that. I know very well that healthy dishes can be made that still taste fantastic, which is why it baffles me they should make these choices. My suggestion of minestrone would have been a vast improvement and still fit within their healthy, low-fat, vegetable-heavy theme. Instead, it seems, this menu makes eating into an act of penance. Food should not be equal to suffering – something to be ‘gotten through” and then be thankful it is at an end. I have had my fair share of disappointing dining experiences, and more often than not, been willing to overlook a bad entrée or two and try again. In this case, I’m quite certain it would be only more of the same and I must say, “Thanks, but no thanks.” We will not be returning

The restaurant was very nicely laid out, the food was excellent and we had very comfortable air conditioned seating for 12 people. I had really great service from Janina who was really attentive and good sense of humour. Three of us selected the delicious Lamb Chop Loillipops and we were delighted - the rest of the table had a variety of choices but all said the food was great- thank you Janina

I didn't expect this at all, we when for lunch before a movie and wanted to get the afternoon off to a great start. We went for Jamies place, because we thought the quality would be implicit in the name...It couldn't have been further from our expectation. First we are shown a table and left to find a 'white shirt' ... i.e.. a server, after approx 10 mins a server arrives (now this was late lunch - it wasn't that busy!). We ordered 1 meal plus side and 3 meals (4 total), 4 drinks. After approx 20 mins, one mean arrived with the sides for the other, then a 5 min wait and another meal, then eventually the final two meals -by which time the sides had gone cold and the first meal had been sent back - under cooked and cold. Of course by the time that meal came back (MICROWAVED HEATED -not made again) everyone else had finished.... We did talk to the chef, who explained and apologised etc etc BUT frankly this is not whats expected from a big name chef place... cold food, VERY poor timing, re-heating etc etc. One of the meals was pappardelle (now 2 of the four of us are living in ITALY - and have never in 4 years seen pasta like this) - it was the texture of octopus, looked like brains and tasted of nothing. The Arancini was tiny, undercooked and cold and i haven't got long enough to describe the absence of service. One meal was pork chop - very small and over cooked..... I mean come on, pasta bad, arancini bad, pork chop bad.... all different types of food!..... what happened to the law of averages? All in all we will not go back and we will tell everyone we know, why. The chef almost offered us a free desserts, but we paid up and left. If i tried to recommend something- For those adventurous enough - try and get a window seat (on the outside) as this has views of the water/sentosa, seats inside are quieter and look on the mall. They have two types of beer (one was out of stock). theres people in grey shirts (don't know what they do), white shirts are servers... why they don't all help customers is beyond me -it would save a lot of time waiting. to be frank the better recommendation, based on this experience would be try somewhere else

Visited restaurant on 09 Dec at 1830Had to wait a long time for order to be taken, one of my son's ordered a sirloin steak very tough, I had pork chop tasty by vegetables served with it were tasteless. My wife had meat balls pasta overpowered whole dish sauce was too thick so not enjoyable. Very pricey as service throughout was poor, staff had a could not careless attitude, My wife went to Jamie's in Perth which has excellent which is why we made the reservation in Singapore but the difference between the two is enormous

We searched around the Harbour view area for some time to find some none Asian food (just wanted a change !!) and came across Jamie's. The restaurant has good views looking over the Harbour and is a nice place to spend some time, eat and relax. The food was good albeit perhaps a bit pricy for what you got. It was the overall service that let this down were we had to ask for service very step of the way.........and it wasn't that busy. If they can improve this and make you feel wanted the food could speak for itself and improve my overall view of the experience

I must agree with others who say that the meals took a while to come out, when the restaurant was not overly busy. Nice food though, at reasonable prices. Staff service was 'just ok'. I would recommend Jamie's if you would like to eat somewhere decent at 'Australian prices'. This was my first Jamie's experience I must add, so I don't have another to compare to

My family was looking forward to eating at Jamie's but unfortunately, the restaurant didn't live up to it's reputation.Upon being seated, it took the service staff longer than usual to bring us our menu even though the restaurant was quite empty.After placing our order, we were short of 1 kid's cutlery set. We asked a male server for it but he didn't come back with it.We were given only 2 glasses for the ice water even though there were 4 of us. I asked for an additional glass from the same server and reminded him of the missing kid cutlery set. Again, he didn't come back. We had to share the 2 glasses and cutlery among ourselves throughout the meal.We had a kid's meal which came with a bowl of salad instead of the promised "Shake-Me Salad" in a mason jar. Also missing was the kid's drink, which should come with the meal. We were totally disappointed with the non-existent service that we gave up asking for it.Last but not least, our order of bread was also forgotten among the chaos.I doubt we will be returning to this restaurant

Pleasant atmosphere for casual dining for everyone. Attentive food servers. Great food made from fresh ingredients. Pricing is reasonable for the quality. Definitely top of my list for Italian food.

The best thing about Italian food is its so simple yet delicious. I love watching Jamie Oliver cookery show as he simplifies each recipe such a way that it is so easy to prepare at home. I was really happy to see Jamie Oliver restuarant in Singapore. It is very conveniently located at vivocity and I usually visit this place with friends and family. The ambience is good and best part it is a very child friendly restuarant . They have a quite good menu from antipasti to wine, good selection. Polento chips are awesome!Must try!Only thing which I feel the lack is they don't serve chilly flakes
5
The food was outstanding along with the service! The staff were incredibly patient with my father who is a very demanding customer. It was my birthday celebration meal and we have happy memories of my first ever visit to a Jamie's restaurant particularly returning to the the country where I was born for holidays

This is all personal opinion. But I have never heard anyone say anything good about this place over the last several months. Jamie's opened to much fanfare, went from long queues to short queues in 60 days and now boasts immediate seating. There's a reason. It isn't a nice place to eat. The food is bland or the opposite--smothered in irrelevant spices and herbs. It can come on the Jamie plank, a kind of flat surfaced board reminiscent of US fraternity spanking boards. The food is also overpriced. It is a bit like Jamie's ubiquitous face all over ads across Canberra. His decision to go with Woolies as a front man is symptomatic. It's all ads, in front of ads that are in front of other ads. There's no substance any more. Service? Well, it's fast food in a City that is short on working staff. Guess what that means

I'm sure Jamie Oliver is as focused on service as he is on the food at hand. I'm sad to say that both let him down massively tonight, at his Singapore branch. It started off great. It was a lovely evening, we were able to sit outside, and the bread arrived promptly. But the rest was downhill. Pan-seared Tuna does not mean raw old tuna. And when we asked for it to be seared a little more as it was not fresh and was therefore unacceptable to serve raw (it had no flavour and the flavourless purple yams didn't help), we expected the waitress to at least try to help, rather than say "I told you it was like this". We also didn't find if as amusing as the wait staff that instead of searing it, the chef cooks the hell out of it and it comes back leathery and chewy. I have never sent a dish back in my life, but I did so because it was really not edible the first time. I think, that if I'm spending $30 on a meal, I should be able to eat it. So I continued to eat my overcooked Tuna with a spoon as the waitstaff didn't think to bring more cutlery when they took my plate away the first time. They also cleared my partner's plate before I was even halfway through, so I couldn't even use his. Finally, the other dishes were completely underwhelming, and even us non-chefs can produce something that both looks and tastes better when we throw together one of Jamie's quick meals at home. We don't go out often, but this was a special occasion and I'm sorry to say it's the worst $80 I have spent in a very long time. As I said, the first and only time I have sent a meal back. The staff were so very rude and unattentive, and we did not receive one sorry. We also noticed the herb garden was on the brink of death. It all screamed lack of care of and inability to get the basics right, which is what Jaime is all about. I never write reviews but as this was truly the worst dining experience I've ever had, I thought I should let others know.

The good things: friendly, efficient service, great draft beer, nice atmosphere.The bad things: unfortunately for a restaurant, the food. Undercooked pasta, over cooked burger, a salad where Pecorino is in the title, but was almost non-existent in the dish itself (and the accompanying pear was tasteless), bland olives, indifferent bread. And way, way over-priced. (I complained about the pecorino, and they brought more - but I was charged for it!).So, disappointing on the food front, but still had an enjoyable time. If it hadn't have been a Jamie's and I had therefore had lower expectations, is have given it 3/5

Good food, awesome atmosphere, efficient service. Posh chips were soggy but the tiramisu was to die for

I've always been a fan of Jaime Oliver and first stumble upon his chain in Sydney. Having opened in Singapore, I went for a go just to get seconds.The branch in Singapore is pretty spacious and are very accommodating to large groups and families. The service staff good and attentive.The menu is the same with the one I had in Sydney so I had a good comparison. The pasta is pretty good and maintained the same quality I had expected and I love their fries - all versions of it.The restaurant is quite popular from what I can tell so prepare to wait on weekends

It was my birthday lunch with colleagues and we decided to give it a try. We were seated near the entrance, missing out on the sea view. We should have requested that area when we arrived since there were a number of empty tables. (Oh yes, we did make a reservation about 3 weeks in advance, so i don't think it's because those tables were reserved by others).We had the Cured Meats, nothing to rave about. Our mains are Lamb Chop Lollipops, Prawn Linguine and their lunch special, Pork Sausage Pasta. None stand out really, except the pricing. The only thing that deserves a thumbs up is the free drinking water. However, there was a waitress that walked away after seeing us waving at her. That was kind of disappointing. Will we come back again? No if given a choice

Went to Jamie's for dinner with friends yesterday. guess with his name and all that hype iin the past, we had high expectations. sadly it was not met. decor of restaurant is nice enough. we had a nice, friendlly wait staff who could not for the life of him recommend anything. but he was nice and changed our glasses which were dirty (although those should not have even been on the table in the first instance). so we had to wait each time for another more experienced staff (forgot to get his name) to make the recommendations for the food, wine and desserts. apart from the great wine we had, the food was below par - actually disappointing. perhaps the chef was having an 'off' day. Seems like they are also understaff as we had to wait to get the attention of the staff most of the time. service and food quality must be improved, otherwise, Jamie's is just another name. nothing special
5
Went with my son, daughter in law and grandson. Great food and location. Good choices too for little ones. Not expensive, went both and lunch time and for dinner. Would recommend.

I've been a fan of Jamie Oliver since his Naked Chef days. I was prepared to be blown away by the fare served at his restaurant. However, the reality of the experience fell short of expectation. Our dinner there started off well enough. The advance online booking system ensured minimal waiting time, and we were shown to the outdoor table quite quickly. The decor of the restaurant is homely and comfortable. A point to note is that if it looks overcast, avoid sitting outside as even the tables under the shelter can get very wet. If its a clear day, time your dinner with the USS fireworks. Sadly, the food was the real let down. We ordered the Wild Mushroom and Smoke Mozzarella Risotto. It was underflavoured, with poor seasoning and far too little smoked mozzarella. Some of the arborio rice grains were still hard and gritty. I bit into something very hard and initially assumed I was biting into a particularly tough grain of rice, but it turned out to be a stone (it was the thickness of 2 grains of arborio rice)! This was just unacceptable and I showed the stone to the waiter serving us. This was followed by a different member of staff coming by to "ask how he can help"? I found that expression a little unsatisfactory, considering I had just found a stone in the food. I would have expected an upfront apology and an assurance that the cost of the risotto would be taken off the bill. A female manager eventually offered to offset this when we made payment. I felt it could have been better handled. The Honeycomb Cannelloni was good, but after the risotto, I was already slightly put off the food. Our kids were also not particularly enamoured of their rather bland Curly Wurly Tomato Pasta Bake. We had tried to order a cream-based pasta for the boys, but were told that there are no cream-based sauces. Hmm. They also forgot to bring over the salad fun shake. When they did, the leaves were wilted and unappetizing. Not sure if this is the best way to get kids to eat their veggies. :(How I wish it had lived up to expectations
3
My wife described this as the best pasta dish she had, the prawn linguine. Whereas, my meatball pasta dish was just about making average. The pasta for me was undercooked and the meatballs dry.The kids menu is very good and good healthy choices, although they completely forgot the salad fun shake, when given there was only about 8 tables occupied at the time, there was plenty of staff hanging around. The staff ranged from really friendly to miserable and aloof, so luck of the draw as to who you happen to get.Decor and ambiance was nice, we tried this given its good reputation in Sydney, but overall considering the prices you are paying, was a left disappointed

... Going to realize that a trendy name and a "concept" design interior do not make a great bar experience!Have visited Jamies a few times for dinner and ok, it's not great but the food is always tasty and consistent. Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for a quick sundowner ..... Inexperienced bar stuff who rely on pouring to the micro millimetre for spirits, zero confidence and connection with the customers .... All adds up to a feeling of "cheapness" and just not a venue where you want to spend time or revisit. "Jamie" - yes it's tough to get and retain good staff in Singapore - but that's just the way it is - if you can't train and get your staff to engage - then Jamies will end up just another star of mediocrity in an already crowded local bar scene .

We were impressed with Jamie's Italian in Leeds UK so wondered if this restaurant would be the same. The menu is much smaller and definitely not the impressive choice we had in Leeds.We ordered crispy squid for entree and it was a very small serving and not as crispy as I expected. Our mains - beef/pork meatballs with pasta was luke warm and the meatballs were pale, small, insignificant and tasteless. My husband's prawn with pasta was also luke warm and average for taste; also very small sizes considering we both ordered a main course. There was no connection with the staff except for the girl who took our order. She had some personality, however we had to attract her attention to order, and also only got told that there were a couple of 'specials' when I enquired about it at the end of our meal. We should have been told before we ordered. There is absolutely no personal touch, no care and attention and the staff have no pride or connection to the fact that they are the frontline staff for a famous chef. When we arrived, I asked for a seat outside as the outdoor area is very big. I was told it was wet. Well after we finished, we walked to the outdoor area and I was surprised to see that most of the tables were dry because they are under cover.!! Very disappointing, it was as if the staff couldn't be bothered to seat us outside. To be honest, don't bother going unless you want an extremely average meal. You could cook better at home
1
Food was good but they need to improve service.,warm water took half an hour to serve, serving our starters and mains without cuttleries, nobody check our food if its okay or what. bartender attending to us with unreasonable explanation about the bad service
3
Came to singapore for the weekend and thinking to stop by to VIVO CITY for the sake of trying Jamie Oliver's Italian rest for the first time.ordered caprese salad (big portion),pink snapper fish,tagliatelle bolognaise and baked mushroom.food wise was so so,only pink snapper fish was great. Expected to have a great experience knowing the owner is celebrity chef, but disappointed after tasted it. Caprese and Italian bread came after main course served, baked mushroom was so ordinary even the one in pizza marzano is way better. Service was quite poor as resto wasn't really busy but they looked busy but kinda lost.called them several times to get them to approach us.feels like having meal in the food court instead of trendy resto. They forgot to serve Italian bread basket that we ordered and also Caprese salad. It came only after we finished the main meal. Please improve it as I really love Jamie Oliver.
2
This is a restaurant, price above the average, owned by a celebrity "chef", so I would expect it was better than others in the range, but it is not. The crab spaghetti is watery with fishy smell, tropical drink is nothing close to delicious, only the entrees was ok.It is ok to go there just once, check in facebook, upload some photos to tell people you been there and get it over with, because it simply not worth the price, I wouldn't even go there again for free, the food is nothing you can call delicious, service quality was up to the price though
1
The general reviews that I've been hearing about this restaurant has been bad. I was running alittle late for a meal appointment with my friends and I told them to decide on a place for dinner and I'll meet them directly. We ended up in Jamie's. We shared the Bakes mushrooms which was recommended by the waiter. It was pretty average in taste. Nothing fancy, nothing great.I ordered Crab Spaghettini and to my horror, this is probably the worst pasta I ever had in my life. The pasta was dry and hard while the crab meat wasn't fresh with a stench of smell. I have had pastas from many countries and restaurants, and I'll have to say even PastaMania will be a hand downs winner if there was a battle.Service was okay but I thought that It would be nice if you had at least one service staff stationed outside. Whenever we needed something, we had to wave our hands in unison just to catch the attention of any passing by staff in the dinner place inside the restaurant
2
There were four friends having dinner on a Saturday evening. We ordered cocktails, starters and main courses. We received the cocktails and the starters and immediately were served our main courses? We did not say anything at first, but then we noticed that our main dishes were getting cold.Will say that was very surprised that in a restaurant of Jamie's that the staff would have been better trained. It put a damper on the dining experience.Really not much of an apology from the manager, but maybe she is used to these kind of complaints
4
tried their plank specials and it was definitely yummy. The servings were huge. The specialty pasta was yummy and the desserts plank was simply divine. Service can be a bit erratic and hard to call when you're in the outer part of the dining area.
1
Very bad experience over priced inefficient and in edible really disappointing given the brand. Food was served at different times was uncooked and tiny portion
2
we wanted to go to Jamie's already for quite some time and finally - having a good friend from Germany in town - we made it here.... the restaurant's atmosphere is by far the best of the overall experience, servicewise you do not have the feeling that the staff is well trained and they even had a shift change during our lunch. to the food.. we were hungry, so we ordered starters first. having soft shell crab (totally over salted and tiny portion), crab bruschetta (4 small pieces with some guacamole and crab creme aside - fully tasteless and over priced at SGD 14,50) and some italian bread with some olive oil/balsamico aside. frankly, I love bread and olive oil/balsamico but what was that ?? totally rancid taste and a helpless waiter to explain this further to me.. it came to the main course and we were already wondering, if Jamie ever visited his own restaurant here or even trained the staff... for the main we had Aubergine Parmigana which was a soso, none fancy, simple dish at SGD 22, we had Penne Carbonara at SGD 22 and Spaghetti Nero with Mussels & Octopus af SGD 24.50. here as well wondering what makes it the Jamie's experience as every 'normal' Italian restaurant can do such dishes better, more tasty and surely less expensive... adding here that my son has some kids dish with chicken skewers and fries.. the chicken was ok, the fries were factory made ones with poor quality... and when we asked for ketchup we got served pure tomato paste...Jamie... I love your cooking shows, ideas, inspirations and personalty - don't get me wrong - but better you do not run restaurants, which you cannot control yourself and your Jamie's Italian food experience here in Singapore was one of the worst Italian foods, I have ever had... first and last time... next time we go for sure to REAL Italian again

my wife and myself visited this restaurant in October. Like most people we have watched a lot of his shows on TV and like his style with cooking.Having read a lot of the reviews before going along I have to say we were programmed to expect ordinary food and ordinary service.To be honest, the service was excellent. Not too pushy and also not the other extreme where you have to wave at them to get attention.The bread combination for munchies was really good and tasty. Obviously fresh and very enjoyable.No entrees, just main courses. I had the steak and my wife had the cannelloni.The portions were good and the flavours were excellent. Also the food was hot.All in all we loved the place and would go back again.A really nice way to spend a few hours with my wife and have some really good food
4
Great food but quite expensive. Also, service was so fast that it was unpleasant. There was no gap between drinks, entree and mains. Complete meal was done in about 30 minutes, with no time for a break. When dining at such a location, it is good to enjoy the ambience
4
Visited JO for the 2nd time for my friend's birthday on 25 Sep 2014. Reservation online was made efficiently, followed by a text confirmation. We shared and enjoyed several dishes : the fish & meat planks, chicken, pasta, a lamb and a bottle of wine. Most of all, we enjoyed the brownie very much. Overall, we were happy as we found the food was tasty, and had a lovely evening.. However, still had an issue with the waiters who always appear to be very busy - was difficult to get their attention
4
Another 1st visit to a relatively new restaurant. Well designed interior, good service, and best of all, they have a very good variety of Kids menu which is rare for restaurants of this kind. Would definitely recommend to families with young kids. The food is good though some may find the taste a tad light
3
The renowned name of Jamie Oliver was what got us to give this restaurant a shot in the first place, despite hearing negative reviews. Sad to say, the reviews were right. :/ The food was sub-par and average, and we were quite surprised that we had to pay for bread despite the European style it was supposedly adopting...? (Restaurants in Europe mostly don't charge for bread...) The staff was nice enough not to charge us on that though, and the food portions were fair. All in all, it was a rather disappointing dinner, and we expected much more from a name like Jamie Oliver. Tourists, stick to the Jamie's in your hometown, would be much better than the Singapore branch..
4
Food was alright but not wow.... It's really kinda raw, simple taste, and home cooked brit style in a way... You prob can follow the recipe in jamies book and get the same results. No fancy flavors. But then again it is jamies food. Haha what I enjoyed was the great brit music and dark ambience , some 80s music , 90s brit pop.... U just feel u r in uk... Didn't try the bar but looks good. This is good place for a hang out but don't expect fine gourmet food

We visited Jamie's on my birthday and found it disappointing mainly due to the service and the foodThe restaurant is very nice and has a good feel to it but a very colourful wall mural just did not fit in.We ordered the meat plank and cauliflower fritters to start with and pasta for mains the guy who took our order couldn't work the PDA at first so had problems with taking our order he finished by asking whether we wanted the starters at the beginning or everything all at Once? We made it clear that the system was starters first then mains later ?The cauliflower fritters were the first to arrive and did not taste of much especially cheese the meat plank was a very nice combination of tasty meats and little tasty nibbles which I found most enjoyable to eat but as I was half way through somebody turned up with our pasta and trying to dump it on the table ! Despite confirming with the waiter we did not want everything at once he took them away and returned a few minutes later as I was finishing the last piece of meat but we still felt hurried with no break between courses.my main was tagliatelle bolognese the meat sauce with herbs and Chianti wine sounded lovely especially with the crunchy herb breadcrumbsthe reality was ground beef with not a hint of wine or breadcrumbs the other pasta dish with garlic prawns was equally uninspiring and because they timed bringing the food out wrong the rocket leaves on top had wilted to a sad green pile.Both dishes could only be described as bland and not what we were expecting from Jamie's Italian restaurant. We had some tiramisù and a cheese plate for dessert and despite coming from the same plating up area arrived nearly five minutes apart it was frustrating with one dish sitting there watching them wander around their area but not making a simple dish with three cheese on a plate The Tiramisù was missing coffee flavour ? Just orange ?The cheese plate when it came had a good combination and was enjoyable.Other little things that made the night a poor experience was our wine which was very nice and accompanied the meal well was put in an ice bucket the other side of our table out of our reach and we frequently sat with an empty glass due to inattentive waiters the service staff were saved by a girl called Sellina she was very good and came to help several times when we were struggling to find our waiter.We were there mid week and the place although was busy it was not full or too busy to easily attend to customers as you would expect

Was there 2 nights back for a birthday dinner. I must say that I was left disappointed with the whole dinning experience. For starters, we were not happy with our table but by the time we ordered then did we realized better tables further in. Had Caulifower & Parmesan fritters for starters, seems like such a odd number to have 3 cauliflower & parmesan fritters instead of a even number. Plus it didn't have much flavour to it. Nothing to write home about.Mains were sent to our table not long after we got our starters, just seemed odd to have our starters and mains together so we sent it back and when it got served later , the rocket had already wilted, and the meal wasn't hot enough. Couldn't taste the garlic in the prawns neither could I taste the chilli. And the pasta itself was dense, come to think of it, it was meant to be Prawn Linguine but it wasn't Linguine!!And I was left eating most of my pasta with a fork and knife until I was given a spoon halfway through my meal. The tiramisu was alright, a little too much orange flavour, couldn't detect any coffee flavour at all.Overall, food was average, expected much better but was very very disappointed. Service needs much improvement as well. My overall dinning experience was just average.Will have to think twice now if I want to return to Jamies. Last but not least, would like to mentioned a service staff by the name of Selina, one of the more attentive and better member of staff

Went for anniversary dinner with my Significant Other last night. I've been a few times before with colleagues, but it was her first visit. It won't be our last. Friendly, knowledgeable staff (our server knew the menu backwards - I think her name was Jasmine) who strike that rare balance - attentive and responsive without excessive hovering. The ambience and décor are top notch. Of course I already knew that having been there before, but when she arrived my wife's reaction was "oh wow!". Can't say more than that really.The meal itself was spot on. For starters, the planks are to die for and the crispy squid is excellent. I then had the Rump Steak which was done exactly as I asked for it, and my wife had the Pasta Nero with Octopus & Mussels. Generous portion too! All washed down with a bottle of 2012 Abruzzo Il Faggio. All in all, an excellent way to end a Monday, whether you're celebrating something special, or just celebrating the end of a Monday (or any day for that matter

I took my children here for lunch as they are familiar with Jamie Oliver, who just recently came to their attention again in the documentary "Fed Up", and wanted to check out "his restaurant". What I loved most was the restaurant space itself - so eclectic and mostly rustic, but with enough modern touches to keep it edgy. The music that was playing would be more suited to dinner dining though; perhaps something more Italian for the lunch time would work better with the feel of the place. For food, my youngest chose the 'puppy dogs' (mini hot dogs) from the kids' menu which had other offerings such as mini sliders, rotini pasta, fish fingers, etc The kids' meal is $11.50 and comes with juice, small salad (not really appealing; raw veg might be a better offer) and fries (not top notch). She was quite happy though. My eldest and I shared a bowl of spinach and ricotta ravioli (yummy, but $26.50 for the biggest bowl, which turned out to be small in reality, was overpriced so disappointing in that regard), polenta chips (good; think some tomato relish on the side would be nice) and the walnut salad (very good). Every table gets a bottle of water on the table, which is always a nice touch in this hot climate.The service was lacking, but that is typical for Singapore. While our server was pleasant and helpful enough, she must have been new. She brought special cutlery to our table even though we hadn't ordered yet (she thought we had), and charged me for my daughter's juice, even thought that was supposed to be included with the kid's meal. But my fault for missing it as I didn't check my bill closely enough until we were already long gone. Sitting near the cold food station, we were watching lovely boards of charcuterie, cheese, antipasti go out, along with tempting desserts, out to tables. The prices on those are high, but I think I would try that next time as the plating was beautiful and would hope the quality of food would be a match. So, in spite of being somewhat disappointed, I also would return to try some other dishes and give it another chance

Heard quite a few nice things about this restaurant and like his programmes and cookery books so went along with some friends to try. We were suitably impressed, lots of good attention to detail. Tables nicely set. Water glasses immediately filled and refilled throughout. Menus left for us to look at - good suggestions from the waiter, who was excellent by the way. The food was delicious - I had lasagne with pumpkin, the meat platter also very good as was the risotto. One glass of wine, two coffees and some polenta chips came to about $160 so not cheap but well worth it for the great food and service. (a rare find in Singapore!

Great food, lovely ambience, wonderful service ..overall an amazing experience. Has a lot of vegetarian options and the recipes are unique too with delicious flavours! Slightly expensive but great choice for occasions.

We had dinner at this restaurant on a Friday evening; the restaurant itself is tastefully decorated yet also somewhat formulaic in the sense that it rather desperately tries to evoke the feeling that Jamie's cook books do. These cook books, by the way, are for sale throughout the restaurant, as are other 'probs' that could give your kitchen that truly Jamie-feel to it. A less cynical person would simply appreciate it and move on but for me it was all a bit much. While eating I couldn't help wonder if I was buying into a faux/ersatz version of a 'true' Italian restaurant. Singapore has plenty of 'real' Italian restaurants that do Italian cooking as it should in an environment that is inspired and original. Jamie's Italian is none of that... What begs the question of course is if this matters at all. Was the food good? The ambiance okay? As for the latter a definite yes. The ambiance is great. The restaurant was pretty packed and reservations are advised. The food was very average though. As a starter we had a meat platter which arrived on a wooden tray that was positioned on top off two cans of tomato paste. Its nonsense like that which always irritates me. The meats were okay-ish in the sense that the taste was reasonable but nothing special. As a main course I had the lasagne which I thought was downright disappointing. The sauce was oddly sweet and the pasta slices mussy and too thick. I have had better lasagnes from the supermarket that I had to heat up in the microwave. My partner had the lamb chops which were delicious though. We also had a portion of the truffle fries (I can't remember the exact name on the menu) which were decent as well. On a whole I am somewhat twisted between 'poor' and 'average' but truth of the matter is that the food is not bad and compared to other Italian eateries not hugely expensive either. Service was friendly but clumsy, our wine arrived after our starter for instance. All in all not bad but certainly not great either

Tried their Signature Pork Chop. The meat was well marinated, grill to perfection. Juicy meat inside. So wonderful. Another is the Salumi Spaghetti- freshly handmade everyday tossed with cured meat, tomatoes and zesty lemon juice. So good!

We stumbled on this restaurant after a shopping trip to Vivocity. It was a restaurant where all 5 appetites could find something suitable.The kids were sooo excited when they saw Jamie Oliver's books around. We didn't know he had a restaurant in Singapore!Place was busy (good sign) but this meant service was a bit lacking. Lucky for us we were sitting near a waiters station so could request service if felt we were being neglected. Kids meals were fairly priced but 2 out of three were keen for big delicious portions from Jamie! We all ate pasta - pomodoro, bolognese (which smelled and tasted wonderful), lasagna and spinach ravioli. My 11yo daughter who normally eats very little, loved her ravioli so much she ordered a second main, and ate it all! We all loved our meal. Drinks were served with too much ice, I quickly reordered without ice. Thanks Jamie (even tho I know you are nowhere close) Would eat there again, maybe earlier so less busy
1
As a family of four we had lunch at Jamie's in Singapore on a 1 day layover from Thailand back to South Africa. My experience:1. Mojito Cocktail I ordered was just ice and I sent it back to be remade.2. Starter plank for four was a few odds and ends, completely disappointing.3. Mains where OK not good neither bad.4. We skipped dessert as the first two courses where overpriced.Bill came to 250 Singapore Dollars, If we pay this amount of money you expect a five star restaurant with exceptional food. Not the case here.This restaurant is a total rip-off and will never see us again. Don't be conned into going there for the name its a let down from start to finish
5
Came across this as a surprise, thought why not give it a try. Well worth it, great food, flavors and the lemon meringue is to die for.Kids meals are yummy and a decent price:)

Third time visiting Jamie's Italiand and it is for a friend's birthday. Did not make reservation as we arrived early so the wait is minimal, it has improved significantly ever since the opening (I was at the opening phase of the restaurant, complete nightmare!) we were seated very quickly, made orders for our dinner and we had a good experience. Food was served very timely, once starters were completed, our mains are ready to be serve, quite impressed with that. They use tomato cans to stack the dishes on a small table, smart product placement :) birthday boy is very happy, and we had a good celebration

Once again, this is one of the best meals we have ever had in a restaurant. My overseas guests are so impressed with the whole dining experience - the quality & freshness of the food; the taste of those beautifully presented dishes; the cosy ambience; and the feel good service. My guests love the Meat & Fish Planks (the best they ever had); the Grilled Pork Chop (absolutely haven); the Lamb Chop (done to perfection); the Sea Bass (firm texture and sweet); as well as singing praises over the interesting Cauliflower Fritters; and the Crispy Squid. They want to come back again and bring their friends to enjoy these amazing dishes in their next trip. Also, I want to thanks the Manager - Sandra; and our Servers Janina and Connie for recommending us the Daily Specials as well as providing us the impeccable service that never once failed to impress my guests. No wonder, the restaurant is packed on a weekday's night. Nevertheless, thank you again Jamie Oliver for bring your lovely restaurant here to Singapore

We went for a dinner with a couple of friends. Food was terrible. I'm italian, and that is definitely not italian food. The cannelloni had a very sour flavour and were partially uncooked. The tuna pasta was definitely too "al dente" and the flavour was not good. On top of that, portions are really small and the bill was not cheap. The only good thing I must say was the service. We left all the tuna pasta and we have not been charged for it
3
Was quite disappointed in a number of aspects. Portions were too small, food was just warm enough, kids meals were anything but healthy which was very disappointing given Jamie's stance on this. Service was too slow and it seems there was more effort placed on selling $25 branded table napkins than serving quality food. I actually wonder whether Jamie Oliver actually has anything to do with this or he has just sold his name, either way not great.

I am Jamie's fans, visited 2 restaurants in London and recent one in Singapore. Love the taste and the menu in Singapore. The manager picked the daily special for me, love them all, more tasty than the 2 I visited in London. Love the service also, warm and relax. Wish will have more souvenirs choices. Chefs in VivoCity, keep going

Visited restaurant on 12 Sep - 140pmRestaurant had few empty tables, and not busy - but was asked to wait for 5 mins at the front to be seated.Ordered Crab pasta (2.5/5)Squid ink pasta (3/5)Rocket salad (3.5/5 - portion is small)Fried Calamari (3.5/5 - portion is small) - some chinese restaurants cook a better versionSGD 80 for mealService was slow, food served was surprisingly- not hot. As in warm.Pasta was a bit hard - not sure if its Jamie's version of al-dante.Surprisingly mains were served before entree and salad.Tables beside us was complaining of cold food, and slow service.We were VERY THIRSTY after the meal
5
Bergers are great and the pasta. Great service and price for Singapore. We will be back. The only down fall is the price of drinks very expensive
4
Bieng able to eat on one of the most famous chef's resto is already cool for me.. But after i ate the pasta... Yummy... Not to mention the plave looks cozy and so nice... Looking forward to eat at night.. Will come back for sure.. We Had lunch by the way..

We're always here for pasta. The pasta is cooked to perfectly al dante. The sauces are just nice. The only possible complaint I would have is the serving might be a little small, even for small eater like me.We've tried a few appetizers before and cauliflower parmesan fritters are by far our favourite! It's a dish to die for! Really nice!The brownies is really rich. And the waitress was really nice to offer me non alcoholic ice-cream upon recognizing the fact that I'm pregnant. I didn't even know it's served alongside of alcohol content ice-cream. Really nice of the waitress.We were here for at least 3 times over a year. And in fact we're going again next weekend for birthday celebration. Looking forward

Linguine Vongole ($27.50++) was the special pasta of the day (not on the menu). Tossed with Manila clams, sliced chilli's, tomatoes, parsley and anchovies, this homemade pasta dish was very light on flavour and the sauce was sweet. So light was the pasta that both of us decided to ask for some Parmesan Cheese, which descended like fluffy snow flakes. Oh boy, the cheese made a whole lot of difference to the dish. The Baked Salmon ($23++) was well seasoned and not overly cooked, though the whipped lemon "risotto" seemed more like puréed cream without any grainy texture. The desserts were not those gorgeously plated sweets but as casual as the likes of the British chef. My brownie-loving partner who has a penchant for rich dark chocolate, couldn't stop showering her praises for the Epic brownie($11.50) after taking a bite. The seductive fudgy dark chocolate is lifted by the hints of boozyness in the amaretto ice cream and accented by crunchy popcorns, making it a rich yet none too cloying treat. Jamie's tiramisu ($11.50) has a clear division of labour between the coffee sponge and sticky mascarpone. It is definitely very robust in the java and little citrusy with the presence of orange shavings, though the overall texture was dry. The savoury dishes did not spark excitement as the desserts did. I was looking for set lunches since we came at 12 noon, but the board at the entrance wrote 3pm-5pm. Strangely, we noted that it became 12pm-5pm as we left the place. Perhaps our eyes were playing tricks on us. For full review visit blog under my profil

we went in and only wanted to have a drink our waitress sheryl was polite friendly and extremely helpful she recommended a tasting plate it was delicious
2
premise - nicely done and very rustic feel to it. dimly lit at certain areas but a good place to hangout i guess.location - vivocity so there will be space to park unless its the weekendstaff - greeters were good (in black). waiters were good (in white). manager was good (whatever he wants to wear i guess). server (in grey t-shirts)- ABSOLUTE crap; she was impolite and very nonchalant serving our table with almost the wrong food.crowd - better to be in large groups. many business people and also teens. few couples.food - sigh.... it was a total let down. apple salad was interesting. 5 pieces of wings aka 2 n 1/2 of full wings were at $12 - like WOW!? crab spags were under cooked and out to table warm. prawn lings were SALTY as the ocean. we didnt eat the mains and the resto didnt charge us for it.price - not going to make too much noise about it as it's "Jamie's" after all?verdict - just go once if you want to have that JO vibe in you, after all, he IS famous... but food wise? a total let down. i will try again as the meat dishes look good... so fingers crossed
5
I ordered the black angel spaghetti( squid ink pasta) and the rum steak. The pasta has a well flavored taste and is very delicious. The steak was also juicy and delicious.The downside is that the portion are really small. It's not at all filling.Also ordered ice cream for dessert. It come with 3 scoops and different flavour( can choose). Like the honey comb flavour especially. Again, the ice cream is very delicious but portion is rather small also, although not as small as the main course.Anyway still give it 5 star because i rate it based on the quality of the food
4
3 of us visited this place for lunch and i would say the experience was decent, but franky, we were expecting more class, service, quality given it was "Jamie's" after-all.The main courses were pretty reasonable portions but the pasta in the crab meat pasta my friend ordered was under cooked. I ordered a 'new burger' and asked for mustard and avocado on the side to be refused. Disappointed here!!The brownie with ice cream was a winner and the tiramisu was pretty good too
3
Was curious about this great chef so we decided to have our dinner at this restaurant although the waiting time is about 30 minutes. Homey and beautiful ambiance. The menu is filled with delicious options and the waiter recommended us the the planks so we took it -- it's a platter of meat and fish. Not bad but not great, the grilled chicken tastes good. Portion size were pretty small so it's not really filling. Was thinking to order some extra food but the price and portion seems not worth it. I paid S$200++ for 3 persons
4
If you are in the area, Try out Jamie's , can be some waiting on Saturday evenings, we started out in the bar while waiting for a table, cool menu for the kids
5
I personally experienced dining into a homey, beautiful ambiance Jaime's Italian Singapore. The host Clifford & Anna greeted me with a very warm smile & accommodatingly assist me to my table, Joan enthusiastically explained the special dishes for the day and Apollo assisted also in giving awesome service. Ordered appetizers: crispy squid ink pastanero. Can't get enough of the nutritious food, I ordered the irresistibly plated profiteroles for my dessert. With the happy environment, healthy & tasty to the max food plus a topnotch serviced....I will definitely comeback to Jaime's Italian once I am back in Singapore

I really enjoy Jamies in the UK, and so when travelling solo for business in Singapore I thought this would be a good place to eat. I was on my own and although the restaurant was fairly busy, it wasn't packed. The server asked if I was ok sitting at a high table, which I was, but they actually sat me at one of the food prep stations, with the guys making up meals right in front of me.It's not great eating out on your own anyway, but I felt like they put me there so I didn't take up room at a table (of which there were plenty spare) which made me feel even more highlighted!The area was badly lit and not that comfortable.When the food arrived it was ok, but not as good as meals I've had in the UK. Portion size not massive although I didn't leave hungry.Overall I was quite disappointed, though I guess it might be ok if you were in a larger group
2
I visited Jamies on the 23rd August for my 54th birthday with my family and wish I have made a better choice.My wife and I together with my mum arrived early at Vivo to check out a good place to have my birthday dinner and after going around I decided we should have it at Jamies since we have heard so much about this great chef and coincidently I shared the same name as Jamie (mine is spelt as "Jamy") I thought why not try it out as the physical look of the restaurant looks real nice to me. My wife tried to make a reservation since it was still early but was turn down however it was great that the front counter lady ran after us when she realise I have my 80+ yr old mum with us and allow us to make the reservation. So we were looking forward to our dinner.When we finally got seated - the service was prompt and the Filipino staff Cheryl was great and friendly. She made some recommendation on offer that evening and we went with it. I gave her 10/10 for her service level.When the food arrived we were greatly dissappointed that they were really in small portion. We wanted to order some extra food but reckon that for the price and portion it isnt worth it. Does the food taste great to warrant the price - I dont think so. I would say probably it is the name "Jamie" which equal the high price and small portion but definately not great taste enough to justify the price.Seems like we were there to nibble on the food much like some "finger food".Our last "dish" took 40 mins and many rounds of chasing after the staff for it to arrived.For a dinner that cost close to S$200 and still left me as hungry as before I started the dinner is certainly going to be my last visit to Jamie.I concluded its nothing more than a hype. Thanks for the experience Jamie and of all day on my 54th Birthday. One of those bad choice I made in my 54 years
5
Love Love Love this restaurant. I had hoped that a restaurant carrying Jamie's name would be a quality experience and we weren't disappointed. The menu is filled with delicious options and we particularly like the planks to share as a starter. The service is as good as the food which is flawless. We have now been a few times and walk out incredibly happy every time. The view from the restaurant is fantastic and the atmosphere at the restaurant is great
5
When we went to SG, one of the highlights of our trip is our experience with Jamie's Italian. The ambiance of the whole place is very warm and homey. It will make you feel like you would want to stay a bit longer inside and order more food. I would also like to thank our server Sheryl, for always attending to our needs and always checking how our food was. But what we really enjoyed in Jamie's is the food. We ordered Rump Steak and Mushroom Risotto and it was amazing! We would definitely go back if we ever came back to SG
3
I am a great fan of Jamie's restaurants in the UK and had no doubt that eating at Jamie's in VivoCity would (or should) be any different. I have to say, I was disappointed. The staff were very friendly, however the first thing we were told was that they had only rotered in one waitress for the entire outside eating space so service would be very slow.... that made absolutely no sense to me, especially in mid-August when Singapore is buzzing and busy. The food actually didn't take long, but it was undercooked and tasted very bland indeed, especially considering the cost. The wifi also did not work. I wanted to come back and write a wonderful review as I thought I might. I would give it another go but not without hesitance
4
I must say I'm impressed by their improvement in service, by Singapore's standard. Although still lack of smile, which I don't blame them with the long working hours, but everytime I went back I notice a raise in service standard.A captain at each section keeping watch if any hand is raising from a table, wait staff coming over to ask me how's the food (though I wonder if they did it on purpose when they came to us when my mouth was stuffed with a piece of chicken...maybe they recognised me. :p), the relentless thank yous behind us as we walked out of the restaurant. I think that made me felt good spending money there.Food taste I must say is subjective to individual. I'm no professional food critic, but I have to say the ingredients are definitely fresh.I would strongly recommend the Italian Spicy Chicken Wings. Done like buffalo wings with a tat of spiciness, the garnish of sun dried tomatoes and whole olives are just perfect. I can't wait to taste that again, though I wonder why it's odd number in terms of the number of wings and drumlets... makes you fight for the last wing perhaps.The epic brownie would be a good choice for those with a sweet tooth to end the night on a high note. It replenishes your body with all the energy lost over a long day of shopping. Out of this world

Leila greeted us at our table with a warm smile after we braved the chill of Vivocity to get to the restaurant. We ordered a meat plank, a crab spaghettini, a honeycomb cannelloni and some breads. We were really looking forward to the splendid treat. Unfortunately, the breads were cold upon arrival n a felt the crab spaghettini was a little salty. The meat plank and cannelloni were fine. Initially we wanted to try their desserts but diminishing enthusiasm prevented us.
5
My family and I thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and service. We were well looked after by Jasmine. We were given the wifi password the moment our phones and i-pads hit the table. The place was crowded but the attendants seemed efficient in dealing with each table, and offered plenty of smiles and great service.The food was very tasty. The three of us shared two starters, a main each and two desserts, and paid a very fair price for it with mains ranging from $18 onwards, and desserts from $7. The tiramisu was lovely and moist, and the epic brownie with ice-cream was this side of heaven. We will definitely be returning
2
Unacceptably poor service. First we sat and nobody paid attention to us for 15 minutes. Then we noticed another table had been vacated and not cleaned for half an hour at least. They said they would bring water, and brought the glasses, but then did not bring the water for two hours. They brought the mains at completely different times, and forgot entirely to bring one main and one salad. The grilled chicken was too salty.One waiter told us there were not enough staff and that some waiters were not trained. However, in the end the manager did come to our table to apologize.In short, Jamie Oliver's attracts customers because of the name, but in our experience the food was average and the service substandard
5
I'd an extremely awful day yesterday till I dined in Jamie's Italian at Vivo City - the high quality & flavoursome food, the heartfelt service, the comfy sofa, the cosy ambience, and the refreshing cocktails simply wind me down! These are also the reasons I keep coming back (with friends) as you never failed to surprise my guests. The Planks; Cauliflower Fritters; Aubergine Parmigiana; Truffle Pasta; Tiramisu; and Lemon Meringue are irrepressible mouth-watering
5
Tonight we dined at Jamie's; it was excellent! We had a very tasty salmon, a simple but good lasagna and than desert; the epic brownie. The name of this desert is perhaps a bit pretentious but will certainly not let you down! Without a doubt; best brownie I ever had!!!!Surprisingly, I see a couple of negative reviews on this page which I don't understand. I can and will recommend this restaurant to everyone who will visit Singapore. Great place, great ambiance, attentive service and excellent food. What else so you need?
4
Kids love the pastas, and I love Jamie's Burger.. It's very good!The resto location and view is also very cool, since facing the water and Sentosa Resort if sits close to the windows.

We went to Jamie's Kitchen for a late weekday lunch. The cafe ambience and food reminded us of what we really missed in Melbourne. We ordered a pasta special of the day which had a slow cooked beef Ragu that melted in our mouths. We also had the crab toast which was light, refreshing and accompanied by two great side sauces/dips. The pork belly dish had awesome crackling and the presentation was somehow something we hadn't expected. All in all a good experience and we would love to come back for the food. The service was ok for Singapore standards. A welcomed addition to Vivocity. So far our fave Italian style place in Singapore. (Haven't been too impressed by Italian food here much
5
太好吃了吧 5*- Fish/Vegetable Planks; Lamb Lollipop; Grilled Chicken; Prosciutto Pear Salad; Bolognese Pasta; Truffle Pasta; Prawn Pasta; Cauliflower Fritters; Spicy Chicken Wings; Crispy Squids; Posh Chips; Tiramisu! Brownie 有点甜...不过, 还是挺好吃的 wor!
服务也 excellent ah! 这个七月,我带不同的朋友去了两次!.下星期四,再会去多一次... 太期待了! Jamie's Italian Singapore 赞！

This place has a name and a brand, but it does not live up to the expectations. The atmosphere is nice, but the food is average and the price is on the high side. The real trouble is with the service, the staff is half of the time not paying attention, they left our dishes getting cold at the counter for 10 minutes, we could see them and guess they were ours, but the waiters just walked by as if it wasn't their job to bring it over (we saw the same happening to other people), the other half of the time it seems they are doing you a favor to give you a table and to serve. We went there 2 times, the first time it was bad but the place was crowded, so we tried again at a more quiet time, unfortunately it was still bad
3
I'm very impressed Jamie can maintain the food quality and its delivery in a high standard cross all his restaurant globally (tried a few cross countries); however, Mr Jamie, if I were you I would invest more on the management. We arrived there at 2pm with no booking, 80% of the restaurant is empty with tons outdoor seating as well; but the person who run the floor kept us waiting at the door for more than 15 mins and at the meantime turn down a couple groups who tried to get seats there, saying "as you can see we are very busy at the moment, can you come back later?" What?! let the customers (cash) swimming out of the sea? I thought, maybe it's marketing trick, creating the demand and desire by turning customers down first? but hey.. it's a Sunday with 80% seats empty, I think the management should really reconsider this strategy.
3
Spent my birthday here last year. I was excited to eat here since I'm a fan of Jamie Oliver. We arrived early so we got to choose good seats. I had difficulty understanding the food attendant though (wasn't used to Singlish). Food was okay (wish the serving was more generous) but a bit pricey for me (heck, it was my birthday.. I was willing to spend.. hahaha)
5
Went to Jamie's on Thursday night for dinner in a group of 4. Glad we booked as place was full by 8pm. Drinks of bottled beer and ginger beer were really good, esp the latter, not too sweet! Started off with the recommended spiced chicken wings and vegetables on plank anti-pasti, and we weren't disappointed! The cauliflower fritters was a nice surprise too! Then came our mains of lamb chops, prosciutto+pear+pecorino (our favorite dish of the night - we shared our mains), truffle pasta, and balognese pasta. All of which were well prepared and tasted excellent - the spices, the imported ingredients and the cooking were highly commendable! Desserts consisted of the must-try tiramisu, choc brownie, and profiteroles - all worth going back for! Last but not least, the serving staff were knowledgeable and helpful, which together with the great food and the beautiful Sentosa sunset, made it one of the most memorable dining experiences I've had recently! Thank you so much Jamie's Singapore, will definitely come back soon

My kids surprised me with dinner at Jamie's for my birthday. It's so difficult to find a restaurant to cater gluten-free options so it was exciting that we could have gluten-free pasta in a restaurant. The manager assisted us with all our options and we were told they would even clear out the kitchen to make sure there was no cross-contamination. Wow! I was impressed.Sadly the food that came was disappointing. My daughter ordered the kids baked pasta. She was disappointed as it was not baked and were told this is because the breadcrumbs were removed. We ordered the crab pasta, prawn pasta and rump steak. The rump steak was done medium but was very tough and all of us found it hard to chew. Crab pasta and prawn pasta were unfortunately watery and bland. The sauce was disappointing and didnt have the flavour that I was expecting. We arrived very excited but sadly left disappointed

Don't waste your money here. Don't even go in for the cocktails at the bar. I KNEW there was a problem when we walked in on the last day of Ramadan (and my birthday) and every single chain restaurant in the mall had a line except for Jamie Oliver's place. "that's strange," I thought to myself.Greeter was nice and polite, explained a short wait, and we asked about bar seats instead. No worries and done. She left to clear and someone else came up and asked same questions. Little bizarre and not organized, but it was a holiday in Singapore(Monday but end of religious period).Sat down and waited 10 minutes for a bar that was staffed to come over. They didn't. So, my fiancee took over and started signaling with her arm raised. 3 or 4 minutes later, finally got someone. he came over and took our orders and answered our menu questions.Wine came out quickly, the cocktails took a lot of time (probably 8 - 10 minutes). Not complicated drinks, either. The app we ordered was an antipasto platter on a plank. Advertised as an assortment of charcuterie and various pickled veggies and some thin bread crisps and cheese, etc.What came out? A plank, with some meats that were nice. A few slices of cheese and one caper berry and one sliced pickled pepper. Really? This was the charcuterie plate for two, not one, and it was lacking. It was meat with a pickle.In the interest of time, we ordered two cheeseburgers and a rumpsteak. Quickfires for all, so no worries, right? WRONG. THe rumpsteak wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great, nor was it good. The seasoning was good (garlic and herb), but the cut of meat was extremely chewy and sliced incorrectly. The cut along the grain along with the cut of meat made chewing a laborious task. I jumped into my cheeseburger while laughing at my fiancee, assuming she had ordered incorrectly and my burger would be a home run.WRONGThe burger, and my friends burger, were HORRIBLY dry and over done. I am using the caps to emphasize reality. I know those caps are annoying, but it was honestly that bad. They also stacked the burger inside not grilled but charred hamburger buns. Dressing the burger? Really sour and unpleasnat pickled peppers (more on the burger than on the damn charcuterie plate!). They were not good. I am a pickled food freak, and these were sour bitter tart as in an off not well fermented food. The burgers also came out well after the steak??We asked for the check and ran for the movie we were planning on viewing. The staff behind the bar did nicely ask how the meal was and what are our thoughts were. We didnt want to hang around but we were honest on the burgers - dry and did not taste good at all. And he said he would share it with chef. But, front of house and back of house, come on. On your own, you need to improve. But as a part of a global brand like Jamie Oliver? COME ON. I won't go to a Jamie Oliver restaurant and I will loudly beg anyone I meet to avoid at all costs.DISAPPOINTED AND A WASTE OF MONEY

I was very pleased with my visit to Jamie's Italian last night. As we were such a large party they offered to open the private dining room for us. We had a great view of the Harbour Front and the staff were very attentive. The food was good (try the olive starter) and we stayed for 4 hours. A great evening with friends and the staff and Jamie's made it even more enjoyable.
3
My family was there to celebrate my birthday when Jamie Italian first started at Vivio City. The food was fabulous. The pasta was superb. Could not fault them at all.We went again this time and was very disappointed to find that the standard has dropped. The pasta sauce was diluted. No longer has that rich flavour. At Jamie's, we expect a certain standard for the food served. Service can be average but Jamie's food must always be at its best.Very disappointed
5
This was the first time we had eaten in a Jamie's Italian Restaurant but we loved it. The food was great and reasonably priced. The service was prompt and friendly. We returned several times while we were in Singapore as we loved the food and it was not expensive. The home made lemonade was great! Since then we ate in Jamies Italian near West End and we did not like it nearly as much. The food was not as good, nor was the service. We had expected it to be much better than Singapore being in London, but it was nowhere near as good
4
Food excellent and reasonably priced, good location in ViVo City and kids were welcome with coloring in pages and toys for them avaialable
4
Have eaten here twice and both times I couldn't fault anything. The food was delicious, authentic and fresh. I highly recommend trying a pasta (made fresh daily). The service was attentive without being intrusive. Our young children were well catered for with a refreshingly healthy and reasonably priced kids menu as well as colouring in to occupy them while we waited for our meals. Would highly recommend

We had a table booking for this restaurant,so when we arrived on time, we were told to wait at the bar until the table was ready!Once seated we were not attended to by any staff member until we got their attention for service. We had to ask for water for the table. The service is appalling. No effort is made to come to the table to take our dinner Oder or check on drinks. When we had finished our entree, we told the waitress if we could place our main meal order, she didn't seem fussed if she took it or not. Mains arrived but we had to enquire where our salad was....At no point did the waitress come to our table to enquire how our meal was. i had to ask for Parmesan cheese for my pasta, then only got dried Parmesan, no one else at the table was offered any. Our drinks were not checked on, hence we sat there dumbfounded at how bad this restaurant is run. We decided to order dessert, but no one came near the table , so I had to go find a staff member for the dessert menu. Had to ask for the bill after waiting for quite a while as the waitress was busy folding serviettes. When the bill was was finally bought to the table, all that was said by the staff member was THankyou for coming, but not anything about how did we enjoy our dinner!!! Spent a lot of money at this restaurant, and left very disappointed. Would not go back or recommend it to anyone travelling to Singapore. I have dinned at Jaimies in London at this service was impeccable. Firmly believe in a strong customer focus for a business to survive, this restaurants lacks it completely

Went to Jamie's Italian restaurant in Glasgow & my expectations were very high as their service & food were excellent in Glasgow.However the restaurant is Singapore was a quantum leap difference & I left with disappointment & was never going back. Firstly, the male host(Filipino guy)was very rude. There was a long queue before getting into the restaurant for lunch so my friend went to the ladies. When it reached our turn, he refused to seat us as my friend had not returned from the ladies & pointed me to the counter to wait even though I said that she'll be back in a minute, he refused to budge. When my friend returned shortly, I went back to the male host & informed him that my friend had arrived,he completely ignored me & continued to clear the queue. Only after a long while,he ushered us to a tiny table for two & ignored our request to sit by the window instead & gave some excuse that those tables were reserved.Ok never mind , I didn't want to ruin the atmosphere as it was my friend's birthday. When we placed the orders,the waiter brought out a completely different order. This time, I complained & even though that wrong order was on the house, so what? We had to wait another 15 minutes for our actual orders to come. By then , our tiny table was extremely cramped with 2 main dishes & a extra dish that we didn't order. And the food portions were so small for such a hefty price & it's the main course no less. And the food didn't taste that fantastic .Anyway with so many service missteps, we decided NEVER to return to the singapore's Jamie's Italian restaurant

Fabulous place for italian cuisine, very authentic servings with each dish dacorated and laid well with the food contents. Excellent location overlooking the sea and the santosa island on the far side with its colourful lightings in the evenings. All in all a great place to have dinner

This restaurant was a joke. Over priced rubbish 27 dollar for a burger & didn't come with chips extra cost like something a kid would get with a happy meal.. 13 dollar each for tiger beer in bottles my girl friend is vegetarian & gluten free.. She had a portion of vegetables it was so small 4.5 small pieces of broc 1 slice garlic 2 slices of chilli menu stated pan fried Asian vegetables.. Table service was crap and there wasn't many ppl in the restaurant.. & a 10% service charge was not deserved.. I paid 75 dollar.. Iv eaten on side streets in Vietnam North n South and done Alacarte restaurants and been very happy.. I heard the Jamie Italian restaurant in Perth Western Australia was really good and half the this price.. Iv done a fair bit of traveling!!!

We enjoyed a meal at Jamie's in Singapore as a family of 4 for around S$100 (with no drinks, just the chilled tap water offered free, and no dessert). We were very happy to be offered a table almost straight away, after initially being told there would be a 20 minute wait. My son declared the 'funky chips' (thin cut fries with garlic, S$6.50++ for a small serve) the best he has ever tasted and the carbonara (S$13++ entree size) was also 'just the best'. The lasagne and bolognese were very tasty and the spinach ravioli also nice (but not as good as the carbonara, which my husband wished he had ordered after tasting it!). Wish we could have returned for the set price lunch deal - looked yummy and pretty good value
2
We love Jamie Oliver's recipes and common sense cookery programmes. We decided to go to his restaurant in Vivo, Singapore for a birthday celebration with a couple of friends. They had been there before, for lunch and enjoyed it. However, dinner was a completely different story. The restaurant was busy but not packed. Nobody asked to take our food order for at least an hour after we arrived but as we were chatting and they kept replenishing drinks it wasn't a huge problem. When the food did arrive it was pretty disappointing and not very hot. By that point it was getting late and we really didn't want to start sending anything back.It was disappointing after expecting something special. Unfortunately we won't be going back
4
We had a few meals at Jamie's whilst staying at RW Sentosa, mainly due to them having gluten free options. It was nice not to have to wait for hours for a table like in Perth. Menu is pretty much the same as in Perth and the food quality and prices are on par.

After a well-organized wedding with such good food to taste we slandered through Vivo City and saw Jamie’s Italian. My wife ordered a coffee to make it through the afternoon without a siesta. Me having enjoyed to food at the party so much, I needed my favorite digestive which is I find seldom in this country. But Jamie’s offered me even two different kinds of Grappa. Great atmosphere, many families stop in for a quick bite to eat. We observed a very friendly and helpful staff in different situations. Great place. Need to visit it again especially since the menu card offers such tempting meals at a decent price

Waited 45m with 3 kids only to be told order was lost and meal would be served in another 15m.The restaurant was hardly packed on a fairly quiet Thursday lunchtime.Staff made absolutely no effort to resurrect the situation, with the only effort being made in swiping the credit card and moving us on!Would seriously not recommend this place for families with youngish children, until the management have their internal systems in order

Its Jamies standard dining concept, same as Uk so you know what you are getting- decent food, reasonable prices.Staff very good, friendly, helpfull.Some food options are spicier to meet local tastes (beware the arrabiata).What I liked best other than the familiarity and good standard of food was that compared to many other Singaporean restaurants Jamies team has managed to bring all the food to the table at the same time. you may find this a weird statement, but for those in Singapore a while you will know that food shows up when its ready and not in a co-ordinated manner ( ie all starters at the same time

First attempt on Jamie's Italian. My friend and I had order a drink, main dish and a dessert each.For drinks, we had iced lemon tea and ginger beer - good that they put lemongrass and lemon on iced tea which enhance and enrich the flavour. For main, my friend took a red wine braised beef shell pasta and I took a prawn linguine with tomato sauce. The former one is rich in red wine taste, the beef is soft enough and the shell pasta is al dente. The linguine is al dente too, which the handmade pasta is so fresh and moisty and chewy enough. the sauce can also be retained on the pasta which is not too runny. Yet the prawns are too small and not fresh enough. appreciated if they grill the prawns a bit.Both of the dishes are too oily, though i know Jamie likes using olive oil lolFor dessert, I ordered a meringue lemon tart and my friend took an affogato. both are in very big portion which we should share 1 only. The tart - the meringue is heavier than i expect; the lemon tart is heavy in taste too. The taste is good but very filling and heavy. For the affogato, the coffee is good and the vanilla ice cream is average one.It costs us around 100SGD totally, which is quite expensive as lunch, yet i would recommend trying the pasta
2
Food was good, but not great. The interior and style is like London, so we were very excited about trying a favorite place / chain from London. It was very disappointing. Although the restaurant was less than half occupied, the service was slow and inattentive. Won't go back again. For the price there are better options close by

Great looking restaurant located in Vivo City, what you would expect form a Jamie Oliver branded restaurant. When reading the menu, it sounds great, price OK I guess what you would expect in Singapore. Presentation of food was also great however taste, portion size and value for money, average unfortunately. I ordered two "planks", which is a great concept in order to try a variety of options, taste of some of the items was very average, nothing special, no major 'wow' factor.I would go back to try some of the main meals to see if they are any better
5
My wife and I had a terrific lunch here. We generally avoid restaurants in shopping malls, but this one half inside/half outside, so you can enjoy a view of the water and Sentosa island. There were some set menu specials on offer, but we decided to have a selection of items from the menu.Everything was delicious, and the service was outstanding. For Italian food in Singapore the prices were quite reasonable. No complaints - I'll be back for sure

Last week we had a family dinner at the Jamie Italian, Vivo City and totally enjoyed the food! For starters, we had Fish Plank ($17), Meat Plank (15.50), Cauliflower Fritters ($12.50), Chicken Wings ($12.50), Tomato Bruschetta ($16.50), and Squash Bruschetta ($12.50). The Cauliflower Fritters ($12.50) were a big hit with the kids; they were all gone before I could take a snap shot! I personally like the Fish Plank ($17); it’s a variety of small bites; the beetroot infused salmon was my favorite. The Meat Plank ($15.50) is a mix of cold cuts, and I find the salami a bit strong on taste. JI has a smoking station where they take great care in curing the meat. Chicken Wings ($12.50) were good; though a little spicy for the kids. Love the Bruschettas!! The flavors are great especially the Squash Bruschetta.Main dishes were Lamb Chops ($32), Spinach Ravioli ($26.50), Prawn Linguinne ($17) and Cannelloni ($19.50). The Lamb Chops were good, daughter liked it very much. The kids enjoyed the Ravioli; no chance to eat that! I find the Linguinne a little hard and the pasta could do with more seasoning. The Cannelloni is quite a heavy dish, not for one person.Desserts were Tiramisu ($11.50), Brownies ($11.50) and Lemon Meringue Pie ($9.50). The Brownies were average; had better ones and I don’t get the popcorns; why were they even there? Meringue was well made, light and not too sweet and the little bits of basil bits add a twist to the sweet. The best dessert was the Tiramisu! This is by far the best Tiramisu I had for a long time now. I could taste the liquer and coffee; which are so lacking in many so-called Tiramisu.Overall, it was a good experience, a burst of different flavors! And the staff was commendable; cheerful and tried their best in explaining the dishes. The mix of tables and chairs, wood and metal, the variety of hanging lights, somehow come together nicely and created a cosy atmosphere. And I like that

Well my wife is English so she was terribly excited when a Jamie Oliver restaurant was opening in Singapore. In fact, she wanted to go just after the restaurant was opened but the lines were hours long at the time. We waited a while until the lines died down. When we finally went, I was completely underwhelmed. The food was so so, and very overpriced. I don't eat tomatoes so the menu choices were very limited for me. I had the squid ink pasta and ended up swapping with my wife for the seafood risotto I didn't like either, the portions were tiny and prices high. I wouldn't return. My wife liked it more than I and did go back for lunch one day and ended up meeting Jamie who was in town with his family on his way to Australia...he got a picture with him.

After reading so much horror comments about the bad service and horrible food, I made my reservations at the restaurant for lunch with my mum with a bit of hesitation. I am a fan of Jamie so I had to tried it for myself.Made the reservations online and I shown up with my mum about 10mins before our reservations time. Almost quite immediately, we were told to sit at their bar first while our table is being readied. Given the menu as well to decide our orders. So far so good!Then we got seated and the waiter, Dan took our orders and we were off to a good start. Service was quite prompted, even the table who sat down shortly next to us as well. My mum ordered a coffee and I ordered a lemonade. Perhaps, we took it for granted but coffee should come out much later after the meal. However, when asked to top up with a bit of hot water, it was done readily. We ordered a angel hair black squid ink pasta as starter, 2 mains, the wagyu burger and the pork belly.The pasta came pretty quick but was rather disappointed with the amount of seafood that it was supposed to come with it. There was only about 4 small slices of scallops and for the price of $16, it was a rather expensive portion. Otherwise, it was quite good tasting and a good experience for my mum. Was her first time tasting black squid ink pasta (she is a fan of Chinese food rather Ang moh stuff haha).Both our mains came out at the same time and we share both portion. The burger came out a little overcook for me but the taste was still amazing, juicy and that fragrance. Wow! Inspire me to try do something about my homemade burger as well.The pork belly dish was something interesting. The taste was nice but if the top layer is a little more crispy, it would have been great.After we were done, Dan gave us the dessert menu and we ordered a tiramisu to share. Yummy yum yum! It had that orange zest to it and was so light in the cream. My mum, who really is not a fan of all these Ang moh food loved it too! Portion was bigger than what I had expected but then again at the price, I am not complaining.I went to the restaurant, expecting the worst from service and food. In the end, besides some items not really valued for money, everything else was great. Expensive, agreed but experience was up to par.Will I go again? Sure. I think it is a nice place for a girls hangout night and perhaps to try their other desserts as well

Bring a new experience to casual dining space in Singapore. Love it! The tuna fusilli is different fr others normally presented, taste is good. Apple slaw is refreshing, perfect for starter. Epic brownie was too sweet for my friends and the popcorn with it would be better if it's crisp
2
Had a pasta, grilled aubergine and salmon for two. Nothing special and certainly not worth the money compared to other Italian restaurants in town.
2
Wanted italian food for dinner and tried making reservations for some of the top italian restaurants in Singapore but could not get any seatings as it's a Saturday and we tried too late, around 6pm. Not many choices left and head straight to vivo city which happens to have Jamie's Italian and modesto. Since there was no queue at Jamie's and I've never tried it, decided to enter the restaurant. Upon entering the restaurant, I find that it was pretty dark with dim lights; too cozy for my likings as I've trouble reading the menu in the darkness. Anyway, I also find the the wait staff don't really smile except for one lady whose cleaning the table next to us. As I want to sample as many dishes of their pasta as possible, I ordered the smaller version, which is half is the full dish. Had the linguine carbonara, the truffle tagliatelle and the Jamie's lasagne for the pasta. The breads must be ordered as they don't give bread like most italian restaurants. The pasta were rather bland and only a tinge of truffle can be sensed by my taste bud. My wife had trouble finishing her lasagne (never happened before as she's crazy about the dish). In terms of pricing, it would be a value for money meal of the food was good, at least acceptable. But this was obviously not the case and we were truly disappointed (after watching his programs a number of times). Yes, I do know that he don't personally cook the dishes but I would expect him to at least maintain and watch the quality and the standard of the food served in his restaurant.The restaurant does have alfresco seatings so if u are keen to have a great view over the harbour, ask for the alfresco seats. Other than that, I seriously think that the food did not managed to meet my expectations.

I had a Christmas lunch at Jamie's Italian last year - I remembered the fried squid (delicious, flaky and the perfect amount of oil) most vividly. Pity I should have reviewed it then.I recently had dinner here - I was seated opposite the kitchen and it was pretty hot thanks to the open baking kilns. The service was very prompt which was incredibly surprising and a pleasant experience since service in Singapore is not that great to speak of. I ordered the avocado bruschetta, the mushroom risotto and the fried squid with a glass of their iced lemon tea.Guess this was not their best day - the bruschetta bread was soggy and tasted slightly stale or at least as if it was kept out in the open. The risotto was undercooked but the sauce was delicious and the fried squid tasted like it was kept out in the open for a while - it was soggy too.However, the service impressed me because I went there during dinner which is traditionally a high traffic period and they were super quick and the server was knowledgeable about all the dishes. I will go back a third time to see if I missed something
2
Such a huge disappointment, that I'm suspicious if Jamie Oliver has any say in this restaurant carrying his name.Had heard lots and decided to try for first time. a) no reservations taken, so my husband took a ticket number and was told he'd be called when the table was ready. I and kids went off for 20 minutes. He got a call but was packed off until we arrived together. Once inside saw at least 6 empty tables. Why so prime and strict?b) Unfriendly service, waiter unable to explain the dish beyond it's ingredients. Guess they have little to smile about.c) Appalled at the presentation and price - the plank platter was sat on top of 2 soups cans (was it supposed to be cutesy?) which we were warned not to open. For $17 we got about 5 small slices of parma ham, coldslaw with about 4 'signature' olives, one cracker with cheese and something else that was totally unmemorable.d) Very mediocre food. We had the spag carbonara, mushroom risotto and truffle taglitelli. How could they ALL be so bland?  Bill of one appetiser, 3 pastas, 2 soft drinks and 1 glass of wine totalled $150. Regretted every second and cent spent, pity
2
The food is expensive and doesn't really justify the price! The service was also very slow and there isn't much variety. Overall, just another overrated place

This is my second visit and I've not been disappointed at all! First visit: 23 MayOrder: Crispy Squid, Apple Slaw, Posh Chips, Crab Spaghettini, Lamb Chop Lollipops, Tiramisu and Epic Brownie. I enjoyed every dish! The dishes that made the most impressions were the squid that was fresh and succulent, the Apple Slaw that was organic fresh and flavourful and the brownie that ruled over all the brownies I had ever tasted. The Crab Spaghettini was definitely different from our Singapore Chilli Crab dish and of course, without looking to draw comparisons because they have different influences, it was special in it's own right. The service was excellent; the Caucasian lady server was warm and attentive. She also took the initiative to place a candle on my dessert because I was celebrating my birthday! Such lovely service!2nd visit: 14 JuneOrder: Meat Plank, Italian Spiced Chicken Wings, Epic Brownie and Ice Cream with crushed honeycombs.I had to come back for the brownie, naturally. This time, trying other light dishes. The Meat Plank had lovely complementary flavours and the free range chicken wings were so tasty and wholesome! If the Italian sauce was that good and homely, I'll be coming back to try the tomato based pastas! Again, service was excellent. Compliments to Clifford who made my companion and I feel right at home in Jamie's. He was charismatic, honest, warm, open and humourous. Thanks for making our evening one to remember! Good job to Clifford and the team

Sitting outside looking over the Harbour eating great tItalian food -0 does it get any better. Let me put in a word for Jamie's local draft beer selection - top drop. It's worth the trip to Vivocity, read the sign boards to see where it's located as we took a few minutes to find it. The was our first time eating at one of Jamie's Italian restaurants and it was a good experience. Good value, good beer and wine, great location and excellent food

Brought an overseas colleague to experience the most talked about restaurant in Singapore now! And, he enjoyed the meal - not because I am paying but truly delicious food; awesome service; great selections of classic hits; and nice ambience! We enjoyed the Fish Plank; loved the spiciness of the Crispy Squids & Cauliflower Fritters; and sang praises of the rich and creamy taste of the Squash Bruschetta. We also shared a Prawn Linguine (not too bad but can be even better); and finished off with a Tiramisu (which is the best in town for me)! Shall be back with more friends again! By the way, love the Lemonade! Thanks Jamie's

First time I've been to a restaurant associated with a TV chef. Ambience in the restaurant is nice, descriptions and names in the menu sound great, the food when served looks delicious - alas, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. This is where this restaurant falls short. It's like TV - looks good and sounds good but in reality......While essentially an Italian trattoria with a menu leaning towards hearty comfort food, prices are unexpectedly closer to those you'd find in a posh 5-star restaurant. I'd go to one of the many other trattorias in Singapore the next time I have a craving for hearty Italian fare
4
I guess the 'bar' gets set based on reputation...& this is why I expected 'more' of this Restaurant. While there was novelty written all over the 'plank' presentation & the ambience, the layout & overall setting casual yet stylish, the Ravioli could've tasted betterWorth a visit though
3
Nice service and good food. To be expected from a world class chef chain though. Nothing will blow your mind but you also will never leave here feeling dissapointed.

I ordered mushroom risotto, fried squid and a moscato to share with a friend. That cost $62. It was crowded that Friday and we had a hard time trying to have a conversation --- it was way too noisy.Maybe it's just me --- I didn't like the truffle oil (tasted plasticky) so that spoilt the risotto for me. It was too salty for my liking too.The squid was quite good. Servings are generally on the small side. We could share only because both of us are small eaters. :)
2
There's nothing here to rave about! Service is mediocre, the risotto and mussels were horrible! I've been to Italy and there isn't anything Italian about Jamie's. Food definitely needs some seasoning!Not worth a second trip and would not recommend this restaurant!
1
I should have paid attention to all the reviews but just couldn't believe that it would be that bad given that it is a Jamie Oliver restaurant! Food was mediocre or worse and extremely pricey for what we got. We ordered the weekend plank for 4, which brought us a series of antipastis, mains, and desserts. When the antipasti came out, I had to ask - is this for 4 or 2?! The small portions were almost ridiculous - for example, we got 2 pieces of each of 3 cold cuts (salami, aged beef), which means we had to tear each one in half for us to all have a taste. Same with the minuscule pieces of cured salmon - fancy display on a mound of ice but such a tiny serving, we all basically got a piece about the size of my pinky fingernail! They served 2 little mozzarella balls and that is what prompted me to ask the waitress if this was really a serving for 4 (honestly, I thought they had made a mistake and were just serving for 2) she said, yes it's for 4 and left --- but, her colleague came by almost immediately and dropped off two more mozzarellas. This second waitress, a Brit, was actually the standout of the whole dining experience. She was engaging and responsive and, when we asked about the wine we were drinking, gave us her own tasting notes and contact information for the distributor. Actually, that wine was the best part of the dining experience - it was good and not too pricey for Singapore, so I will give the restaurant credit for that. The antipasti was just OK, the fish/calamari was lukewarm, some kind of fish-spread on toast was not great. The mozzarella balls were the best part, so glad we got 4. Of the mains - salmon, chicken, tagliatelle bolognese, green beans - only the salmon was good. The serving sizes were decent and we had some left over - but that might have partly been because it just didn't taste that great. Desserts were good and at least left us feeling pretty happy at the end. Service was generally quite poor, except for Sarah, the Brit, but if she was brought in to try to raise the standard of service in general, she might be fighting a losing battle. We did leave a little extra tip (beyond the added service charge) because Sarah was great although in Singapore, she'd have to share it with the rest of the staff. We went here because my parents are visiting from the US and I wanted us to go some place kind of cool and special. The atmosphere was pretty cool and we had a great table indoors but with a view of the water and Sentosa. But, I wish we'd just gone to Alkaff Mansion, which is also pricey but the food is so much better
2
Went to see what all the fuss was about and to be honest it was a very bland, tasteless experience and the service was poor & typically Singaporean!Truffle Risotto should have been creamy & delicious and it tasted like rice & cream with no seasoning.Rubbish and not worth it
3
Heard about it and now tried it. Honestly expected more, nothing great just an average meal for us. Service was good, big party and got seated fairly quickly. Had the carbonara and red snapper, the carbonara was average for me. The snapper was better, fish was fresh and tastily done. Other members of the group comments are the same, frozen prawns which was shocking and the mushroom wasn't great either. Overall, good service but very very average food
3
I was all hyped and looking forward to dinner with my friends. We ordered the meat and fish planks with different orders of pasta. Overall I felt the fish and meat plank was average and the pasta could have been better.
3
Service: 5, i came on busy evening...the waitreses seems to busy to handle all the table Expecting more considering their price.Food 7:im not saying its bad...but its just not good enough. I order their ham, salad, pasta and fish  Pasta and fish is ok..salad is good and ham is notAmbience: 8 i like it. Its cold inside and have a good asthetique tastePrice: considering their service amd food, the price should be lower...and just take off jaime name so it can get cheaper.All in all its an ok experience...but will not repeat. Try if u curious just dont expect to much.Cheer

I visited this venue for the first time last week. I enjoyed the lunchtime 2 courses menu for SGD 17.90++ and it consisted of a lovely crabmeat bruschetta and a plate of delicious paste. Had a glass of house wine and ended my meal with an Italian espresso coffee. Will return there on my next visit to Singapore. It is on the ground floor of the Vivo City shopping paradise
4
I have been in this restaurant four times now. I find the service is outstanding compared to usual singaporean service (which is really BAD), they have organised staff although they fall short sometimes. In any case, I have always been greeted with a smile and not the usual I-am-not-interested face which I get in most restaurants here.I had never tried the pasta until last time we were there. I' have tried the fried calamari (outstanding), mushrooms, proshiutto salad (delicious), hamburguer, angus beef, brushettas, chicken wings and most of the desserts...all very good. Coffee is fantastic. But when it comes to pastas, we were soooo disappointed. We tried the lasagna (too much pumpkin for our taste - since when does a regular lasagna have pumpkin??) and other two dishes which where so tasteless I can't even remember what they were. I don't get it...anyhow, I will go again, not for the pasta though
5
Having been to Jamie's in Oxford several times I was looking forward to lunch and it did not disappoint. Prawn Linguine was perfect, followed by a brownie.
Efficient but not over-attentive staff.
5
Initially I wasn't too optimistic about the restaurant due to the not so good review posted here, but then I decided to see it myself.I came to the resto with my father and younger brother. We ordered set lunch menu which consists of 1 pasta and 1 salad. Both lives up to our expectation. The pasta was real good and the salad was very fresh. We also order the olive dish and for me the dish was soooo good (I'm an olive lover and usually quite picky but this one is very high quality). If you are an Italian food and olive lover just like me, I think this place is a must visit if you are visiting Singapore/ vivocity mall
3
Went for lunch on a Sunday. I have made an online reservations earlier, thus we were seated without much waiting.Service staff was friendly, but hard to get their attention.My favourite dish of the meal will be prawn linguine, we can taste the freshness of the prawns even though they are small. I will go back for this dish. However, the others (crispy squid, baked mushrooms, pumpkin tortellini, creamy panna cotta) were just decent
2
the only good thing is the decor i thought i would try the lasagne thinking it should be a simple dish and something that would be indicative of overall standards at the restaurant. It did invoke image of Jamie oliver albeit serving one of those public school lunches. Not what you'd expect at a dining establishment.Lamb was bland and forgettable.i only remember the price.dessert, was shocking due to the quality of ice cream, we were so concerned we wanted to feedback to staff that the ice cream supplier should be changed. However the server had run off after handing us the receipt with minimal eye contact. service standard was subpar due to lack of staff but once again this has become an industry wide problem in this country.overall the message seemed to be 'look we will not serve u great food because we are at an 'affordable' price point
5
It's fashionable to underrate Jamie Oliver's restaurants because of his celebrity status. Having lived in Singapore for 18 years, I have comprehensive knowledge of the city's restaurants derived from frequent dining out, and I'm astonished by the relatively lowly ranking accorded to Jamie's Italian at VivoCity, close to where I live. There are hundreds of seriously mediocre restaurants ranked higher and I am staggered at the lack of comparative knowledge and objective criteria in evidence in many of the reviews. I have dined here several times. For what it costs,which is reasonable, the food is consistently superb, the drinks list is well chosen, service standards are high and the ambience is good. It is well located in a highly successful and accessible shopping mall, and is understandably consistently full, so if you can book (online) do so, otherwise you may well have to queue. Don't believe the querulous carping, and see this restaurant in perspective for what it offers - consistently high standards at a reasonable price
5
With the Perth Jamie's always too busy we were happy to spot this on the promenade. With a waiter giving out free samples out the front from a tasting board we entered the beautifully decorated restaurante, were accommodated in a large booth and given tasty, well priced, well portioned food. Try the lasagne. I don't know what they did to it but it was amazing! As was my prawn linguini.
3
Tried Jamie's Italian with my 3 year old son for lunch. We had a main pork ragu pasta and rocket and radicchio salad. Both were good but the pasta was slightly too salty. Thank goodness that my son had none of the salad as 2 hours later I had really bad cramps and diarrhoea. This continued for the entire night. I was, and am still, 'peeing from my a*hole'. Did you have any other complaints from any other customers? Do you know what was the cause of the contamination?
3
I went to the restaurant at the wrong time as I arrived before noon thinking that they might open at 11am like many other eateries and I did not want to compete with the normal lunch crowd. Since I was alone, I reserved a table for one at 12 and the receptionist who was having a meeting with other staff readily promised to make the arrangement. When I returned at noon sharp, a signboard which originally posted their set menu at the entrance was replaced with a notice saying that their kitchen had no power supply and they had to close for lunch. I was of course disappointed but the staff said it was the first occurence since their opening and they apologied repeatedly. Hard luck! Attracted by its name and the many Jamie TV shows I have watched back home, albeit my hotel is 3 MRT stations away, I returned at noon the following day before my flight in the late afternoon but calling them ahead of time at my hotel to make sure their kitchen is operational, and also make a reservation. The place was almost full when I arrived and I was given a table in the centre of the restaurant next to their open serving/cooking counter. To make things easy, I ordered the set lunch which included a Crab Bruschetta and a Turbo Penne Arrabbiata. The Bruschetta looked good but the taste was quite blend. Fortunately the crab meat seemed fresh. The Penne was cooked al dente and hot but a little too spicy for me though I downed it all as I was rather hungry and the tomato, garlic and basil sauce is much more tasty after having the Bruschetta. The shop is sizeable with rustic outlook and the open cooking/serving counter projects a friendly atmosphere. There is also al fresco dining in the terrace overlooking the waterfront for those who love the sun and outdoor. The serving staff were young, energetic and generally pleasant. All in all, I think its ambience is good, price is reasonable and it's worth returning

jamie's italian concept is simplicity and casualthere's nothing truly remarkable from the restaurantit serves italian food and it also has open kitchen concept where customers can get to peek at what's going on inside the kitchen it also has a section that produces pasta (one of their selling point, making their own pasta)in the front of the restaurant are cooking books and books by jamie oliver himself and some cooking utensilsi remember that the flooring of the restaurant was rough wooden floor and there was nothing much done about the ceiling which was left exposed as it is where we can see the pipes and all (somehow, this simplicity is a trend nowadays among many small cafes and restaurants even many places in asia pacific)i don't remember much about the food that i ate but i remember that it was ok, i am quite satisfied the food that i get for the price i pay the also serves nice bread (most italian restaurant provides bread before they serve their meals)i would recommend reservations when you want to visit this place this place is usually packed not to mention that ViVo city itself is a very crowded place people tend to look for a place to sit down and chillax which includes Jamie's italian for now i can't write much about the foodperhaps the next time i visit this place, i will make sure to remember what was the thing that delight me most but so far, all i could remember was the bread that they serve in the beginning i am sorry that i couldn't provide you all with more informatio

After two different dining experiences in Jamie's Italian at two different outlets in the UK, I really did not know what to expect for the outlet in Singapore.Came here with my group of friends for dinner. The staff coordinating the table was very friendly. In fact, most of the waiters and waitresses who served our tables did a great job. It took some time to get their attention though, but understandably because of the peak hour.I ordered the truffle tagliatelle as I wanted to see if there was any difference between the Sg version and the UK version. Well, it turned out to be really different! The one in Sg had a much creamier and thicker sauce, making the pasta drier and stickier as I ate. It became really filling after awhile, though I must say the taste of truffle was strong (and that's a good thing.)That said, I think it's still worth giving Jamie's Italian a shot if you haven't, but don't go with high expectations.
4
Directly at the waterfront and we lined the interior design - casual, stylish, Jamie...
The food was good though we somehow expected something wow...
The service is good, directly, prompt - which counts high in Singapore.
Let's see if we come again...

Despite the low ratings on this restaurant by many write ups online, I decided to give it a try anyway. First impression of the place was great. Very chilled ambiance with a nice view of the waterfront. Wait staff were very accommodating in finding me a quiet corner with view of water front after indicating I didn’t like the initial dim area in middle of other seats. I felt it too weird to be sitting at a 4pax table alone in the middle of the area. After settling in, I ordered my drink, main and appetizer with the recommendation of a cheerful waitress. Service for food was quick and arrived briskly probably due to it being a workday evening before dinner time. However, no cold water was served until after I had started my meal and ordered drink had arrived. Presentation of food was good but lacked in technical preparation. Pumpkin tortellini was still floury and undercooked on some areas, otherwise would have been a decent starter. Rump steak was well seasoned taste wise and grilled to a nice medium rare but was too tough. Being a rump they should have prepared it in anticipation that the meat would be tough and tenderized it more. I did highlight this to the waitress who came around to ask if everything was ok but she just smiled apologetically and that was all there was to it. I couldnt finish this dish, my jaws were aching chewing it.Might consider giving it another try another day. Not anytime soon as I feel there are better choices out there in this price range
2
Came here for lunch and ordered tuna fusilli and crab spaghettini. Both are pretty tasteless and the amount of tuna given was extremely in small portion and barely taste it. The spaghetti are fresh though but overall is below average. The ambience is nice and crowded on a Saturday lunch. The waitress was not attentive and was looking at elsewhere while taking our order, of coz she missed out 1 of our order. Not coming back to Jamie again

Me and my husband dined on 4th may 2014. The food and service was excellent. We would sincerely like to thank Joanne for her excellent service rendered to us. A big thumbs up for the service! We would definitely come again!! Am

Had the fish antipasti and ordered squid ink pasta with scallops. It was a great dinner where everything tasted well. I will miss this place when I leave singapore

The food at Jamie's is barely OK, but definitely not more. Especially, it lacks any Italian spirit or flavors. What particularly annoyed me was what was passed off as a "porchetta" - no crispy crust, no particular flavor of Italian herbs and spices and all drowned in a nondescript gravy. I could recommend Jamie a great place in Siena to try out what this should taste like...All that at gourmet pricing..

Couldn't get an online booking as we wanted to have dinner on a Friday night 25 Apr. Despite reading the mixed reviews, and felt quite skeptical, we still were determined to try and get a table as a walk-in customer. I arrived at 6.30pm and decided to try my luck. The staff attending to walk-ins was efficient. Walk-in customers were invited to sit at the counter while the tables were being organized. She asked me if we could finish eating by 8pm and I figured given 1.5 hours to eat, we could. Found the service to be mostly efficient, though there were a few times when we found the waitresses just walked about without looking at customers. Ordered the meat and fish planks which we enjoyed very much. Found the meat a tad saltish but overall was good. Portions are small, so we ordered a few more items to share - such as the chicken wings, baked mushroom and two pastas. Informed the waitress that we had to vacate by 8pm, and requested she check on our food orders. Somehow, we managed to promptly finish our dinner at 8pm, but with no time left for dessert. Overall, we had an enjoyable dinner experience at JO. Perhaps we may go back some day for dessert

I went to Jamie's tonight with my husband, my beer was served with a glass that was chipped, the waitress took it away replaced the glass and the beer...But that I'm afraid is as good as it got! I ordered the chicken, with roast potato as a side, the chicken duly arrived and smelled delicious, I'm looking forward to this I thought......Unfortunately when I cut the chicken it was definitely undercooked, blood leaked out all over the plate. I called over a waitress who said she was sorry and took it away...over to a service area I presume, where several members of staff examined it.....The next thing I knew was, a young girl from the UK like me, approached me and said "I'll just pop it back under the grill for you...it won't be a minute"......At that I replied wow!....I then said forget my order......She at this point told me, she does have her food hygiene certificate and was very sorry if she'd upset me, she did offer to replace my order but the thought of staff with food hygiene certification, who think it's acceptable to just pop undercooked chicken back under the grill and bring back the same plate with raw chicken blood all over it disgusts me....I accepted her apology and still do, I don't want her to get into trouble at all, she did tell me she's about to do another course here in Singapore, but hell....Jamie Oliver get yourself over here and sort it out before you end up with a lawsuit on your hands!!

Went to Jamies after working up an appetite morning shopping at Vivo. The planks are a nice tasting but definately single serve. We had a burger and prosciutto salad, the chips were a little disapointing not very crispy but everything else was good. Service on arrival was good but dropped off as we finished our mains & needed to prompt staff for coffee & dessert. Fresh & simple. Watched lots of different menu choices going out to other diners all looked appetising
2
We ate here, on a fairly quiet evening. Restaurant appeared casual, but inviting.I ordered beef lasagne, and it was a big disappointment when it arrived.It was very very hot at the rim, but much cooler in the middle. But, worse than that, there was very little meat in between the sheets of pasta. A total rip-off.I complained via the website, but the manager only got back to me after I had left the city. (I know, I should have mentioned it at the time, but I did think the huge amount of pasta left on my plate might have been a clue, in the kitchen....! No one asked if our meals were okay)I would not return here

I rate London Covent Garden food & place 4stars that I tried a year ago. Singapore 2stars.After reading all the mixed reviews (mainly bad) and I still decided to give it a go. Ordered 2course set - Spiced chicken wing & bolognese spaghetti.Spiced chicken wing is good but not special. Taste exactly like our Singapore Tandoori Chicken. Bolognese spaghetti is dry, blend and lack flavor. Amateur food. Tiramisu is well balance, moist, full of flavor & not overpowering. Is a must try.Fish plank is amazing, especially the clamps & mussels. Missing it already ;). Only disappointment is the artisan bread c/w olive/peppers. No wild factor, bread may have been left outside for a long time. Portion is small but it's good enough for Singapore ladies.Polenta Chips - It was fantastic when I tried it in London. The version here looks exactly the same as London, but taste completely horrifying, tasteless & stale. Compliment: Water is free. Price is reasonable, way cheaper in comparison to London. Interior is warm. Music is perfect. Read bad reviews about the staffs, but I find the service good and efficient

We went to Jamie´s Italian for lunch and it was just OK.The food was tasty, the pasta was cooked on perfection, our only complaint was about the service. The waiter made a mistake and ordered a pasta wich I can´t eat (allergy) and I could see in his face that he was angry with my complait. At the end of our meal, we purchased some Jamie´s products and asked for the bill. At this time, I asked the waiter if I could buy a glass of beer (just the glass, because I have collection of beer glasses from all over the world) and they charged me $20,00 for an empty glass (wich costs less than $1 for the restaurant). It was inelegant by the manager charged such a high value for an inexpensive item, but paid even not agreeing with the value, since it seemed that the money was far more important for the manager of that for me
1
To manager IsivandyServing waiter - NeilWaited for sometime for a table with your restaurant near empty!Denied waterfront table for one pax although guests behind me gets to be seated at waterfront. Neil lied that those guests has reservation compared to myself has no reservation. It's lie. They were just checking out the menu with no reservation and decided to go into the restaurant. Lousy lousy lousy lousy!!!!
4
Very good athmosphere. The decorations, interiors, atmosphere, music backgronud, are numero uno. The service also good. But the food was avereage. I ordered the mushroom risotto and homemade lemonade. The taste were not as good as jamie oliver's big name. Did i choose the wrong menu?or did his standard of taste is average?
5
Some reviews on here are negative towards this restaurant and I really don't understand why.I visited here on a busy Saturday night with the restaurant at capacity and we got a seat without reserving. Service was not amazing due to the restaurant being so busy - but that can be expected in any busy restaurant.I ordered lasagne and it was the BEST I've ever had. Fresh tasty and gorgeous. My girlfriend ordered prawn linguine which was equally delicious. Portion sizes are a little small, so a side may be needed.Well worth a visit if in the area!!!

Visited on a Saturday night. We were surprised to see no queue, but when we left, we realised why.Firstly, there were several empty tables, yet the maitre d’ was hesitant to get us a table and wanted to seat us at a counter seat. We declined and then were promptly seated at a table.The starters were good, albeit relatively small portions: crispy squid ($11.50) and meat plank ($15.50).The jug of basil iced tea was virtually undrinkable – extremely acidic from being brewed too long rather than steeped. A low-level amateur mistake.The two mains were both very poor quality. The vongole pasta ($25) was well presented, but tasteless. Unlikely that the pasta was made in-house. There were also no anchovies, as advertised. The 350g “30 day aged prime rib” ($59.50) was dreadful. At least 50g of gristle. I’m highly sceptical that is was prime rib, and almost certain that it not aged for 30 days – the flavour was just not there. I would have expected that quality of steak from Sizzler for $12.50 and not the high note of a restaurant.The steak came with chips and a few rocket leaves. The tomato sauce/ketchup requested for the chips was exceptional – made in-house and the best I’ve ever tasted.The panna cotta ($9) served with berry compote was nice.The atmosphere is casual and 80s music somewhat loud (but not overbearing). The service was good and the ample number of staff were attentive.Total bill for two came to $178 with no alcohol. Expensive, especially given the mediocre quality.In summary, highly over-hyped with distinctly mediocre food. It’s a mass-market chain quality restaurant with a has-been owner’s name added to try to lend it a semblance of credibility. Not worth it.

My Husband and I are fans of Chef Jamie, so we were delighted to find one of his restaurants in Singapore, we actually went twice.The décor is rustic Italian, for the menu go for the Italian burger, all pasta dishes are amazing.Prices are reasonable, although a bit on the high side.Perfectly suitable for lunch after a busy shopping day in Singapore

Went to Jamie's Italian at Vivo city Singapore on the 26/3/14 with high hopes. It did not meet my expectations especially after having a much better experience at his London based restaurant. For starters I had the meat plank. In one word I would describe the dish as 'gimmicky'. The portion for one person is way too small - you literally get one of what's described - especially considering the price per plate!Next I had the appetizer portion penne pomodoro. The flavours were decent enough but not pasta el dente. My sister had the TURBO PENNE ARRABBIATA, total let down! The pasta was virtual dry, no sauce at all with chunks of chili peppers and garlic it was virtually inedible. Came with a tasteless fennel salad and dry bread as a special for S$17. With exception of the penne pomodoro, don't waste your money getting any of these dishes! Disappointed and won't be back
2
I was pretty excited to try out Jamie's Italian in Singapore after having good experiences in UK. I was disappointed. First, we were made to wait in the corner for more than 20min, waiting for the last person in our group to turn up. This was even when my friend had booked the table a couple of weeks ago and we were not walk-in customers. Even when there were no other people queuing to get in, we were not asked to be seated. We were told there would be a corkage fee of $50 per bottle which I agreed to. 5 minutes later another staff member came over to say it was not their usual policy to allow customers to open their own wine as it may "not match up" with their cuisine. However the restaurant was able to make exceptions in special circumstances. (I guess the 1998 Dr Burklin Wolf and the E&E Black Pepper Shiraz passed as special circumstances.) He reiterated the corkage charge of $50 per bottle. Let's get to the food now. Where do I begin? Good was the crunchy tomato and cheese balls. The rest? Squid was not evenly salted, mini chilli peppers stuffed with tuna were cheek-crampingly tart, lasagne was sitting in a watery puddle for sauce, lamb chops were cooked well through (had to send them back and second batch was nicely pink in the middle). They did offer bread whilst we waited for the new lamb chops.For $50 corkage we got different glasses for both white and red wines. However it would have been good if they had nicer wine glasses to match the similar $50 corkage charge of other fine dining establishments. We got generic wine glasses for $50 corkage.Overall I was disappointed that Jamie Oliver's in Singapore did not live up to the standards synonymous with his UK outlets. Pity. I have queued out the door in the middle of a freezing winter in UK to get in to Jamie's Italian, but I will not be wasting my time in Singapore

Firstly im not a food critic, competitor or being picky. Im just an averge joe who loves to eat.Amid all the buzz about jaime's italian, we manage to find time to pop by to try out the food. Lucky for us, we were there during offpeak hour so seats were aplenty.After the polite waitress took our orders, we waited 30mins before my crabmeat pasta arrived.1st taste, the pasta is surprisingly lukewarm and not hot and the pasta is "really" al dente as in its actually kinda hard, in fact i find it half cook. Salty is the taste and this shldnt be crabmeat pasta, more like pasta garnished with crabmeat as crabmeat is almost in existence...Trying not to make a hooha, so i just kept quiet.Next our side dish came, its actually deep fried pumpkim wth cheese. Its also kinda salty.Till now, my partner's main has not arrived and we kept asking the waiter to check on our order. Honestly they shld just tell us they dont care as when we asked him again, his reply was he had forgotten, not once but twice! The best part is, the restsurant is half filled.We were so pissed that i asked someone of higher authority to check our orders. That was the last straw as indeed, a so call "supervisor" not a local staff came to our table and apologize to my wife. I tried telling him, we waited too long for her mains to be served and mine was lukewarm. He simply ignore me. He just told my wife, the food is coming and off he went.We left after the food had arrived as the taste of my partners pasta is mediocre. Taste of food, varies to different people. But lukewarm pasta and bad service, is a big no!No wonder he is a celebrity chef and not a michellin che
4
Backed to the restaurant for lunch and still enjoyed the food and the service. The Fish Plank; Smoked Mushroom; and Grilled Pork Chop never failed. The Tiramisu is still the best. The service staff are very attentive and smiley! I would be back soon with more customers.
5
Tried a meat platter, crab spaghetti, bake fish, lemon meringue, tiramisu & ice cream when we visited the restaurant tonight. They were all delicious! ! Especially the red snapper, I could almost swallow my tongue together with the smooth sauce that came with the fish. Unforgettable! ! But the best is still the service of this restaurant, the manager, Mr Iswandy, & his assistant, Mr Jason, had brought the restaurant service of Singapore to another level. Thank you for a very enjoyable evening.
3
Went here twice, first with my friends then my boyfriend. I think its quite overpriced for the serving. And how can an italian resto not serve pizza? Thats just bizarre. If you must try, order the mishroom risotto and truffle fries. The plank servings are so little its not filling at all. Nothing special on the pastas even if we tried their bestsellers
4
Always good at Jamie's and this is same as UK restaurants. Not crowded, which was surprising for a Saturday night. Table outside was nice if you do not mind the heat. Price was not too bad and comparable to average Singapore prices. We will be back
3
Lovely ambience and great service, with a unique approach to the children's menu using the viewfinder - but the food just doesn't cut it. We had Fried Three Cheese Gnocchi, the Famous Polenta Chips, Land and Sea Risotto, and the Tuna Fusili. The starters were alright - but once you take into consideration the amount you paid for it, then its below average. The Land and Sea Risotto was tasty but unfortunately again, rather lacking in quantity and you literally get just a few spoonfuls of Risotto. The Tuna Fusili, which was highlighted on their menu was a total disappointment. The sauce is so overpowering that you would not be able to tell that it was a tuna dish.The kid's menu was interesting in presentation with the salad arriving in a "Shake Me" bottle but again sadly, taste was lacking. The salad tasted odd and the Spaghetti Bolognese was very mediocre with the texture of the pasta being rather undercooked and harder than al dente.Lovely place to go to, but unfortunately not for the food
4
After reading the Trip Advisor reviews we expected good food and slow service. The food selections did not dissapoint. We had numerous appetizers and pasta dishes. All were flavorful and perfectly prepared. The service was not slow. If anything, we felt rushed by a snotty server who rudely suggested tnat we order moreand larger drinks, and more main courses. When it came time for our bill she made an effort to ignore us, and we had to go searching for help. Still, the food and ambience over rode her attitude
4
It used to be over-crowded for the first few months but looks like it looks manageable now. I didn't reserve for a table as it was pretty last minute. We walked in and we waited for 20 minutes for a table to be allocated for us.We ordered polenta chips, crispy tomato and mozzarella arancini for starters, turbo penne arrabbiata and wild truffle risotto for mains, tiramisu and warm brownies with ice cream for desserts. Everything was well cooked and tasty! The waiter served a special dip for the polenta chips which was off the menu and it was perfect. They were little late initially to give us the menu so the waiter apologised and the brownies was on the house to make it up to us. Overall, it's good food, prompt service and reasonably priced place. PS: It's a chain of Jamie Oliver restaurant not a restaurant that has Jamie as it head chef so you people can cut some slack.
4
I'm a fan of this place for a number of reasons. The ambience is nice - relaxed and child friendly. The food is great - full of flavour. The prawn linguine is delicious as was the mushroom risotto that was a special a while back. They have been excellent in catering to my dietary requirements. I am coeliac and can therefore not eat gluten. Jamie's staff are quick to seek the advice of the chef as to whether a dish can be made gluten free. They also have gluten free pasta, which is a rarity in singapore. Having been here a few times now, the staff recognize me when I return and welcome me back - also a rarity here. I'd recommend a meal here

I guess the expectations were rather high when I was booking lunch at this restaurant to entertain a friend. We had 2 pasta dishes and both were average. One of the pastas was the special of the day- tagliatelle with truffle. Unfortunately there were just 2 thin slices of truffle and lots of truffle oil on a rather creamy sauce. But the real "special" was the service style: our waiter was seated at our table each time when he took the orders, total for 3 times. It looked so unusual that I was almost going to ask him whether did he intend to dine with us? Never saw anything like that before! The restaurant was fairly busy for a Monday lunch, and the ambiance was OK, but I wouldn't' come back
5
We had a lovely lunch, as per normal the food was devine, but on this occasion I was impressed most by the beer. The local handcrafted beer was fantastic, best beer I have had in ages, and I have tried many. It is a shame that it can not be purchased in Australia. As for the food and service, Jamie's Italian is tops, having experience his restaurants in Oxford & Sydney several times and now Singapore. Please note that you cannot visit the restaurant without having a Florence Fizz or two as did my daughter
4
I had a lovely lunch here well priced and beautiful food the staff were on the ball and the survive was brilliant
I highly recommend this restaurant if you need a break from shopping at Vivo city well done guys

I've been a big fan of Jamie Oliver so when I learnt that he has a restaurant in Singapore, I was excited about going there during a trip to the city. I spent time going through the reviews which mainly were disappointing ones, but thought ok let's give it a try.So today my husband & I went there around 5.30pm. Got a table right away & a waitress spent time taking us through the today's special. Aha, good service! They've made improvements, learning from people's feedback. We ordered basil tea, crab bruschetta, special carbonara, and prawn linguine. Basil tea: for $5.50 a glass, the taste wasn't good at all. It was too bitter to our liking, perhaps it came from the lemon peel. Tea and basil were so mild that we could hardly taste them.Crab bruschetta: overall the topping & yogurt were really nice. Unfortunately, the sourdough was tough to cut and to chew. Special Carbonara penne was nice - light sauce. The pasta was cooked just right.Prawn Linguine probably was the best overall. Fresh prawn but to us the light sauce could have been more tasteful.Music was too loud for this kind of restaurant.Overall, food was ok, nothing special. I was expecting more from the big name of Jamie Oliver. I didn't mind paying the price only if the quality was much better
3
I was somewhat surprised to see many responses by management to comments on this forum. So despite poor ratings of the restaurant I thought: perhaps problems with service have been fixed! But no, it seems management spends more time responding to comments on the forum than fixing issues with service. I consult restaurants a lot and it is clear that this place lacks some simple training for waiters. The place is quite well situated with nice view of the bay, and menu is quite nice, food is above average but prices are way more than average so one expects good service. But waiters are rather clueless: setting up a table, bringing menus, serving drinks - everything takes forever despite restaurant being half-empty. Waiters are rather clueless about the menu and it was never clear whose responsibilities are to do what. To finish it all, our check was wrong. This place needs a new manager
4
Wife had made it very clear this was a must do dinner outing, We had both types of the platters which they sat the long platter ontop of tomato cans ( I'm sure some would frown to this but to us it was quite smart and a sign of the time ) both were quite good and also had the bread trio. Pastas were great, loads of flavour and not huge portions that left you feeling pregnant after eating. We had a great meal here, Singapore is expensive in a whole and it's just what it is so you can't expect the world just because the prices are unusually high. Staff were ok but like the other comments nothing special.
2
This was my first (and probably last) visit to Jamies. Service was really bad and slow. Not sure if the waiter understood us at all. We asked him to bring in the starters and mains at once as our kids were starving. We got the starters after we finished our mains. Sent it back to the kitchen. Kids got their starter salads when we were enjoying dessert... I also had to ask three times to get a fork to start with my hamburger..Food. Kids bolognese was the best dish. Really good! Truffle risotto good as well. Hamburger was just ok. Not as good as we had expected. Not sure if they really use wagyu beef. Fries with truffle didnt taste truffle at all. Food was ok. But in comparison to the price level this was a rip off.
4
Jamie's Italian is one of the best choices in this mall. The atmosphere is great, popular place so waiting for a table is quite common- but totally worth it. The staff are very friendly. The best part is definitey the food, not a great variety but the quality is very good, just what you'd expect from a Jamie Oliver Restaurant. Highly recomend the chocolate brownie - a must
2
I found our experience here frustrating. I have been to 3 other Jamies places in the UK and Australia and this is by far the most disorganised place by far and that is saying something. After making a booking on line we arrived to be told to take a seat at the bar. Ok, but is this a ploy by places to increase your bar bill? Seems to be happening a lot lately. We then watched 3 groups of walk ins be seated before us. After waiting 20 minutes I then asked when our table would be ready and was seated straight away. Our waitress was very good but seemed to be serving a few tables on our side of the restaurant and some on the other side as well. I actually enjoyed the food but it came out in fits and starts, bread well after the entrees were cleared and wine just before the mains. In saying the food was good the exception was a $9:50 salad of a few old cos lettuce leaves that I would have fed the chickens with covered with a thick cloying yogurt dressing. In Singapore, as there are so many good cheap places, once the novelty wears of it will be in trouble unless Jamie sorts the management out
3
Liked the comfortable seating place we were given - nice and spacious side table with a rounded sofa on one side.Like that it is child-friendly as my 4yo was given a piece of colouring paper, some crayons, stickers to keep him occupied. Love the unique telescope-magnifying glass-thingy as the kid's menu. But as for the food, besides the Black Angel Spaghetti which was very good, and the delicious tiramisu, the Fish Baked In The Bag tasted awful, and the kid's salad was awful too. And the thing is for the price, I would expect a bigger portion. Portion was too measly in my opinion
3
Food was good but not exceptional, over priced for the 6 piece if dry ravioli we receive. Service was good according to the busy moment we went, our waitress was really friendly but her manager just didn't care about our complain.

We were so looking forward our visit to Jamie's Italian Singapore after our previous visit to Jamie's Italian Perth. I had made the booking online 3 months prior to my arrival.Very disappointed.Staff were not well trained in handling customers' needs. Very unprofessional compared to those in Perth. We had a very pleasant feeling and enjoyed our meals so much when we visited Jamie's Perth but we didn't have this feeling in Singapore. The waitresses had no smile. As if they were so high up there and we needed to beg for their services.Menus in Perth and Singapore were the same.We ordered 2 kid sets. These sets came with kid salad which should be placed in a plastic jar with cover for the kids to shake before they opened up and enjoy the salad.Our salads were not served until we asked for them.When they were served they were in 2 bowls not in the jars!How can sub-standard service provided or why no standard serving procedures?If you are looking for good food with good service. Sorry...You will be served good food but not good service
1
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie! What's going on? Putting your name to a restaurant that serves low quality food at high prices. 2 starters, 2 mains, 2 glasses of wine - over $200. Would be ok if the food was tasty.Would recommend to pull the endorsement or close the place down or change the management.To everyone else, would recommend to avoid
2
We went for a couples lunch during the work week with the anticipation to eat very well in a decent place. The decor was quite nice, but the service was average at best. We ordered a small salad to share as a starter followed by the chicken main dish. Everything unfortunately was served at the same time and the quality of the food was not impressive at all. The chicken was extremely oily and did not appear fresh. At these prices we just expected more from Jamie .....
2
So we finally went to Jamie's Italian over the CNY period.It was very easy to get a reservation online. I booked just a day before. So much for the one month waiting list rumour. Or perhaps the novelty has worn off.We started with the fish plank and the crispy tomato & mozarella arancini. The fish plank was very good. We especially enjoyed the smoked mackerel pate and the crispy fish with the yuzi mayonnaise.The arancini was a disappointment. Very mediocre, with just not enough mozarella in the rice balls and the sauce was very tart.My husband had the tagliatelle bolognese for his main. While it wasn't spectacular, it was wholesome and satisfying.The biggest disappointment was my main, the land and sea risotto. I ordered the large and it came on a deceptively looking big platter. I dug in my spoon with anticipation, expecting it to sink into a mound of risotto, imagine my disappointment, when my spoon hit the plate immediately! The dish had the most thinly spread layer of rice ever! When I put it all together, it hardly amounted to three tablespoons of rice in all! Furthermore I expected it to be full of meat and seafood as described in the menu. Instead there were 4 mussels, a few olives, no sausage at all & no other kind of meat or seafood whatsoever except a thin strip of pancetta! All cooked in a very salty tomato broth. What a letdown. I had the epic brownie for dessert. It was moist and chewy and good.My husbands trifle was average. There was a very thin layer of jelly and strawberry at the bottom. The glass was filled with cream and there was no meringue at all, as the description on the menu said. The saving grace was the service, which was faultless. In all, a very disappointing experience. Too much hype perhaps over a media chef. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. This fell flat. I would not visit again
4
Hubby made reservations a few weeks before but we realised that even without reservations, we would have been able to get a table quite easily as long as we went at opening time.For lunch we had the famous polenta chips which surprised me cos they came in cubes! The bread basket was a nice assortment of tasty bread with olive oil and vinegar. Hubby has the wagyu burger while I had the squid ink pasta. Actually we shared. The food was pretty good and service was fast. We didn't have to wait long for our dishes. The only downside was that we were too full with the starters and maim courses that we didn't have room to try their tiramisu which is supposed to be really good! Guess that will have to wait till our next visit
4
A couple of years ago, I happened to walk by a branch of Jamie's Italian in London and was pleasantly surprised that I could get in after a very short wait. The food was not bad and I especially loved the polenta chips which I had heard about. So finally after the initial mad crowds had thinned out, I finally made my way to the Singapore branch. After reading some bad reviews, I managed my expectations. Actually the experience was a good one and my wife and I had a nice dining experience. The polenta chips are also really good and I enjoyed my Wagyu burger. My wife enjoyed her squid ink pasta. The view was also very good and the service was not bad. So all in all, very good
4
Good food - nicely presented. Reasonably priced - quick service. Didn't have to wait to be seated. I had crab spaghettini which was delicious and I loved the trifle for dessert
4
I've read a few reviews of the place before I went and was not expecting too much. the atmosphere at the restaurant is 'busy' but in a good way. I like the hustle bustle. definitely not the kind of place to go for a 'romantic dinner for two', but great atmosphere for a meal out with family or friends. Had the calamari starter and steak with salad and fries. food is good - nothing to either brag or complaint about although the steak was albeit not cold, was not as warm as I had expected it to be - but the meat itself was good. I think people have unreal expectations when they come - which leads to some bad reviews but I would definitely visit again to try some other menu items.the service from the staff however was outstanding
4
undoubtably tasty. good service. could have been more vegetarian options. reasonably priced. but get the large size! had to order two mains to fill me up
5
My husband and two children had lunch here after our cable car ride on our last day in Singapore.The children had children's meals and the shaker salad was unique and quite a hit with them.Hubby and I shared a couple of antipasto plates (worlds best olives, italian bread selection, cured and crispy fish) - presentation was gorgeous and food lovely. We are Jamie fan's and were not disappointed in eating here.The view over the water is lovely as well
4
Jamie won't let you down even in Singapore. If you are a Jamie Fan you won't be disappointed. We went there in the early afternoon and had a nice meal with original Italian ingredients and simple but delicious meals. Try the fish appetizer served on a wooden plank ! Just awesome. All prices are really low which was surprising.
5
After reading the mixed reviews, my husband and I were interested to experience Jamie's Italian for ourselves. Long time fan of Jamie and his recipes. The restaurant is classy and chic set-up but not pretentious and family friendly. We had our two young children (4.5yrs and 2 yr old)...we felt relaxed. The spaghetti bolognese for the kids was like good home cooking just like 'Nonna' and nice veggies also mixed through it. The kids, especially the 2 year old demolished it in minutes. The crab spaghettini left me wanting more and I also wanted to lick the bowl. Our mains were also delicious. The highlight being the Epic Brownie, which I would describe as a chocolate fondant....Superb - delicously wicked!! The tiramisu was also delicious. We were so impressed not only with the food but also the great service that we found ourselves back there 3 days later. It was certainly one of our highlights
3
We were all excited about having dinner here as Jamie Oliver is a fan of ours.But unfortunately it was disappointing. We ordered four appetisers and two out of four were just ok. The mains - Crab Spaghettini had no crab flavour at all, just the taste of capers and lemon, the prawn linguine was flavoured by excess salt and the rigatoni arrabiata was nothing special.We also had the honeycomb cannelloni which was different and the nicest dish we ordered.Service was ok and quick, staff were pleasant but the chefs obviously need to add a little of Italian love to their dishes

I have to say I am quite surprised to see so many negative comments. I have been many times since the restaurant opened with friends and with my partner and we have always had a lovely meal. I think the service has generally been above average for Singapore, the food quality is excellent and its all very reasonably priced. Sitting outside is lovely as you get to look across the water and I recommend trying a pasta but get a large one if it is for your main dish. Every time i ordered a small one, trying to be 'good', i regretted it! Also, the 'worlds best olives' really are great!I used to enjoy Jamie's when I lived in the UK and I have never had anything bad to say about any of his restaurants. Perhaps people here are missing the point slightly? It is supposed to be an affordable dining experience rather than aiming to be of 'Celebrity' status. I think he has done a good job and i will continue to visit for a good Italian meal

My first time dining here and at a celebrity chef restaurant and I have to say, I am pretty disappointed. The food was okay, nothing really special. We had prawn linguine (SGD 25) and Crab Spaghettini (SGD 24.5) and it was mediocre. Ambience was okay, with a nice view of Sentosa island as I sat near the window and service was okay too, as I went when they were just opening in the morning.Overall, would I dine here again? Maybe not as there are better Italian restaurants in SG. If I ever were to dine here again, I probably won’t order pasta or spaghetti This restaurant is located at Vivocity Shopping mall. The nearest MRT station is Harbourfront MRT stationIf you think this review is helpful, please click on the helpful button. Thank you :

Was here on New year's eve 2013. Did not have a reservation and was thankful to be given seats at the bar. Service staff was attentive and polite although we waited awhile to have our orders taken.Ordered pastas for dinner, taste was average. There are better restaurants in Singapore serving Italian cuisine for a better price. Think there was too much hype over this restaurant. Once to try is alright, won't be back unless required

was walking around Vivo City last night and found that there was a Jamie's Italian so we decided to have our Sunday night dinner. The menu looked good, ambiance was nice. Wine list was reasonable. But was disappointed with the service quality, as i was finishing the beer, found out that i was serve with a glass that had lemon seeds. Called up the manager to explain and got some lame excuse and that was it. (See photo's attached)it was unfortunate,because the food was not bad. The Jamie Oliver name definitely brings a punch, but please improve your service quality and customer service. You have lost a customer forever

I visited with a group of friends and we were very disappointed with the dining experience at Jamie's Italian. There are several Italian restaurants in Singapore that serve better food with better service at the same price or cheaper.For the price you pay and being associated with Jamie Oliver, we all expected more. The starters were poor. The main courses were well below expectations. Maybe the lamb chops and italian sausage was good. The pastas were soggy and tasteless, although the lasagna was good.Deserts were okay.Unlike some of the reviews, I actually thought the service staff was friendly and reasonably attentive, but just not very well-trained and service is more than just the people, it is also when the food arrives, how the dishes are presented to the diner, if more than one qty of the same dish was ordered, it should arrive at the same time etc.If you have been to good Italian restaurants, than certainly this Jamie's Italian falls compares very poorly. One of my friends remarked it is not even close to other Jamie's Italian restaurants in other cities. I want to be clear: the value proposition of this place was terrible, but the food was not terrible (though disappointing), so I am not going to rate this restaurant as terrible, but because of price, expectation and food, I have to say, overall it was very disappointing and a poor experience

We had a bad experience. Felt a bit fooled by the Jamie Olivier brand, and would not return. We had a large party. Came out to be about $600. So not too expensive. Service was a big issue. We ordered family style and dishes routinely came out 1 by 1 (even when we made multiple orders of the same plate). This bothered us a lot. It set a lousy tone as there was never enough food to go around, and dishes quickly became cold as we waited for for more food to arrive. Piece meal delivery of dishes is not what a large group customers want. Service is somewhat disorganized too. Several times we were incorrectly served dishes from other tables, and the way they were taken away from our table was awkward and gauche.The waitstaff is nice enough though. Our main waiter was kind, and tried to be attentive, but I think the training and management at the restaurant is a little inept and you get to see that clearly when you have a large party. The food did not atone for this.We sampled pretty much the entire appetizer list, most of the pastas, and for the meats we had the pork chop and lamb chops. My girlfriend enjoyed the salads and thought they were the best part of the meal (which says a lot when you really consider it). I thought the meat dishes were nice, however the appetizers apart from the squid were bland. Everything is friend, soggy, and in covered in a flavorless tomato sauce. The arancini were the best of the sad starter lot. The pastas and risottos were also soggy, the pasta far from al dente, and the sauces lightly spiced. The truffle risotto had an oatmeal like texture which was pathetic. Apart from the lamb chops I'd say nothing we had felt like celebration food. I admit I had miscalculated expectations. This is a mega restaurant, turning a couple hundred dinners a night, so the kitchen's priority is speed and not quality. Wine was reasonably priced.The desserts could be skipped You're better off bringing something in from awfully chocolate or the ABC bakery next door. It was ridiculous that a single desert for one diner came first, and we had to wait another 10 minutes for the rest of the deserts to come after. The dessert portions are laughably small as well and don't share well. In particular avoid the tiramisu. Toward the end of the meal I was annoyed by the sense of rush. We were not asked if we wanted coffee. And the restaurant was aggressively wiping down, while the place was still half full. I think if you are craving Italian, there are plenty of superior options in town. I was snookered by the "brand here" and thought it conveyed quality. Instead it represented the exact opposite. If you're the sort that really enjoys doing his/her homework before selecting meals, I'd advise to really look at the menu. There aren't too many fireworks there and you should take your first impression seriously. If you are considering booking a large party, and the quality of the service and food are very important, then you should consider another venue. If you still aren't convinced, walk through the restaurant first. While it's well decorated and has a good ambiance, it's unlikely you'll be impressed by how the food looks, let alone tastes. And if even you are, it's likely that the service will somehow muck up the experience

We had both dinner and lunch at Jamie´s Italian in our last visit to Singapore and was really pleased both times. For dinner (a Friday night), I booked ahead via their online system, no problems, and for lunch we just walked in and got a table in two minutes. Staff is really friendly & professional and the interior is super nice. Food is excellent - don´t think I had Italian this good outside Italy. In Singapore standards the food and drinks are very much affordable. Loved this place and will definitely visit again next time in Singapore

Based on the other good reviews, I'm willing to accept that perhaps we were unlucky. However, 2 strikes is enough, especially for the prices. I went recently to this restaurant with my family for dinner.We had 2 beers, one calamari and 4 main courses. Our bill was S$370....The calamari was quite tasty, but 3/4 of our main courses were disgusting, the lamb chop lollipops being the exception.We ordered a side of the minted peas. When they arrived it was a bowl of leaks with only a few peas in it. And the peas were undercooked. We initially went to this restaurant the week it opened and had a bad meal. We decided that that was probably a rough start and gave them the benefit of the doubt. So we went back a second time and had an even worse meal.Though the food was not what we would have hoped to receive for the price, the staff were absolutely charming. We had about 3 waitresses serving our table even though the restaurant was completely full. I have been to Jamie's restaurant around the world and this is the only one I have been disappointed by.Saying that, there seem to be many good reviews for this place. So I suggest you try it for yourself and see how you like it

I was very impressed with Jamie's Italian, as the food was incredible, full of flavour and at a great price. The service staff were friendly and very attentive. I also appreciated the decor which was tasteful, homely and creative, ensuring you felt comfortable dining there. I definitely recommend visiting this restaurant chain for a tasty and affordable meal

I was surprised to read the previous reviews. I went with my sister who is a big fan of Jamie's recipes and none of us were disappointed. I had the truffle risotto and she had the bolognese. It was really really good. For dessert we had the epic brownie which was absolutely HEAVEN! Not rock hard like a previous reviewer saidm but wet and fudgy! The service was exceptional, Dan (I think) was attentive to our every need and we never had to ask for water. Thanks for the experience, it was great
4
LOVE the food! The Fish and Veggie Planks (to start off) were simply yummilicious. The Lamp Lollipop was truly amazing. And, the Lemon Meringue Pie was THE BEST I have ever eaten. Oh...we love the Coffee! The only disappointment - the Eurasian woman that greeted us at the host (whom we got to know later that she is the AGM) was rather rude! Fortunately, the staff were fantastic! Well, she told us (in a not very impolite tone) - Got to wait for 25 minutes ya! And, asked - What's your name? What's your number? Call you when the table is ready! Hmmm....she needs to be properly trained for the position she's holding

The food was average, we ordered three dishes, Tuna fusilli, and two Mortadella Panz. They were good, but the portions were way too small.The dessert was disappointing, they served us brownie that was hard as steel, probably right off the freezer, we had to ask them to warm it up.Overall, i think the place is ok and a little bit expensive compared to the portions you get
4
I was surprised to see reviews mentioning that the food and service were below expectations. However, it was definitely a pleasant visit for me and my date. The servers were helpful and had provided good recommendations on the items that we should try. I had the fried 3 cheese gnnochi, polenta chips, spring pea & mint pazzerotti and italian farm sausage. Very much wanted to attempt the epic brownie too but we decided to skip it as we did not want to overeat. We really enjoyed our food no doubt for the food we had was really tasty. I will definitely head down to the restaurant for a second or even more tries for it was time well spent. The nexit visit, I'll definitely try the dessert which our server recommended us (: For those who were disappointed may like to give it another try? For those who have yet visited, just head down and give it a try to see if the restaurant is to your liking

Enjoyed lunch yesterday at Jamie's Italian- Vivo City in Singapore. Good location and excellent staff. A good menu with daily specials and a variety of food at reasonable prices. The lemon meringue pie was amazing. We all agreed the best we've ever experienced. They have a daily special of coffee and dessert for under $15 which we will try on another occasion

I wanted to like this place a lot. My wife is a fan of Jaimie's and his recipes so we decided to dine here for dinner about two weeks ago. To summarize the experience: the food was below what we expected, but still decent. The staff, while not unfriendly per se, were not attentive at all and one server basically chucked our starter onto the table.What we ate: Pan-fried Gnochi (bland, don't bother), Lasagna (nice. Uses good fresh ingredients). Italian Farm sausage (really good. if you like meats, especially sausage, order this dish.). Tiramisu (don't bother. a let down, especially since this an Italian restaurant)Ambient: vibrant. which is good because your table conversation is not going to be overheard and the place feels lively.Service (note to management): i completely get that at certain places, you hire certain young servers who are supposed to be cool and look good and might be a bit aloof etc etc. i get that.But if a customer would like to place on order (ie spend money with your establishment) it would be nice to not be completely ignored, while the service kids catch up on gossip, crack jokes, check their smartphones and worst of all, walk by with nose pointed upwards seemingly letting the customer know "I'm ignoring you on purpose.". Will I come here again? You know what? Probably not. For the same money I spent at Jamie's, I can get tastier food and friendlier service just a few steps away, so no. Probably not going back
2
I enjoy his shows and books but when it comes to actual restaurant food, I must say I am very disappointed. Been to his joint both in London and Singapore, where London was average but Singapore side was terrible. the starters and the mains came at the same time and I would not call the food tasty. The Italian scene in Singapore is so competitive that this ranks amongst the poorest I have tried recently
3
Went here last week, on the first visit, queue was around 2 hrs for dinner, so we decided to come back the next day for lunch, so we were comfortably seated inside, ambiance and interiors were good, now for the food, i can say food was great, but servings were really small, no free bread whatsoever, my 13 yr old son ate his Australian chops in around 10 mins and he was still hungry, all our orders were in small servings, you really have to spend a lot in order to satisfy your stomach, wont go back here again
3
We visited Jamie's Italian for lunch expecting some great food after a good experience at the same restaurant in London many times. The restaurant was full so we were expecting it to be good with so many people eating there.Unfortunately the quality of the food was not up to what we expected and have experienced before in the UK. The bruschetta entree was tiny and lacked flavour and quite frankly disappointing. We ordered the Tuna pasta which was quite nice and well cooked, along with the trio cannelloni which was overcooked and was pretty ordinary with not much flavour.Overall I would have expected more both in terms of quality and portion size from a well known restaurant considering the price charged. The service was friendly and efficient and the atmosphere is good. Would we return, probably yes to order the Tuna pasta again and to hopefully pick better dishes
3
Encountered a rude manager with an attitude whose staff were even better than her in terms of providing good service.
4
Had the Christmas dinner set with appetizer, main and dessert. It was a wholesome course and a very fulfilling one. Will definitely return to try other selections

Most friends who've dined there were more disappointed with the "quality" of the wait staff than with the rather "ordinary" food. I think Jamie Oliver is the victim of his own success. Many well-heeled locals have jaded palates from eating at award-winning restaurants fall over the world plus the idolatry of Jamie Oliver sets expectations that are unrealistic. I too consider myself a well-traveled gourmand (it would be too pretentious to use the word "gourmet") and yes, the waiters and waitresses at Jamie's in Singapore do look rather tired most times and service is somewhat lacking but I do enjoy their 30-day aged 350gm Angus breed bone-in strip loin served with wild mushrooms & peppery endives although the last three times I was there standards were clearing dropping. Yes, I've had that steak (listed in the menu as "30-DAY MATURED PRIME RIB") at least five times and the last three times were sub-par. Have they changed suppliers?The GRILLED PORK CHOP ("Marinated & cooked under a brick with parsley bagna cauda, apples, kohlrabi, mint, lemon & crackling") was pretty good but the CRAB SPAGHETTINI was a tad salty probably due to the anchovies and the WILD TRUFFLE RISOTTO, though I ordered the main course portion, still left me hungry! A friend ordered the PINK SNAPPER ACQUA PAZZA which though described as "pan fried" actually looked more like Chinese steam fish. She didn't complain because she was being a gracious guest but I guessed she did not enjoy it at all. But for that price (32 bucks) you can't get a decent steamed fish at a Chinese restaurant here, at least not a live one from the tank. For dessert I always have the CREAMY PANNA COTTA, described in the menu as "wobbly...served with a fruit compote" I am surprised that I enjoy Jamie's. Will I go back? Maybe not so soon, but for out-of-town guests who want to eat in a brand-name place, I think Jamie's a reasonably good choice.Singaporeans should just manage their expectations
2
We really love Jamie's Italian in London and were really looking forward to our visit to the Singapore brunch. It was so disappointing. The service was bad and slow but that we could have accepted. The food was really mediocre, even the children noticed. Definitely not worth going to VivoCity just for that
2
So, this is 1 of those tv "celebrity" chefs who opens many restaurants with aplomb and people actually line up for hours for the food. I was shopping and tried to enter at 8pm, and was told to wait till 9pm. I conveniently continued shopping and returned to see if the food is worth the waitNicely decorated restaurant and it was half empty. Wonder why they made me wait till 9pm. The tables yes, were way too close to each other, and bigger parties get to sit at the sides, not the smaller groupsDidn't really order any appetisers and since it was dinnertime (or suppertime since it was so late already) i decided not have any a lot of carbs, so pasta and risotto were out. Gasped at the $60 price tag for the prime rib. For $70 you get a steak at Morton's or Cut! Decided on the veal, and 2 sides, the green salad and truffle fries. The veal arrived in 5 minutes! Which is not good. It was evidently pre-cooked and my friend immediately remarked it was cold. And because it is 1 molecule thick, all i tasted was the charcoal, the grill and carbon. The salad and fries were passable thoughOrdered the brownie for the dessert and although the amorreto ice cream was nice, the amoretti popcorn is a gimmick and the brownie portion is too smallThis is a casual restaurant with not so casual prices, and below par foo

This place is overhyped for the kind of food we received. The bread selection was cold instead of warm and soft because it's just left to sit there in the centre of the restaurant. In fact our mains were also cold. The tagliatelle was OK but the squid ink pasta was stiff/undercooked. The special we ordered, the sea bass, was bland. This could have been offset if we had been given more than a miserable half-teaspoon sliver of pesto. Felt like telling the waitress, who cleared our plates prematurely and couldn't speak English clearly without her severe mainland Chinese accent mangling her words, to not recommend the sea bass to anyone else because it was terrible. Probably everything was cold because they were pre-cooked - food was served within minutes of our orders being taken. I had expected to wait at least half an hour for something freshly cooked. The nice things we had were the carafe of lemonade and the squid appetiser. The location is convenient and it's very affordable. But these reasons aren't sufficient enough for me to return. I had high hopes given the hype but this restaurant just isn't up to standard.

It was an impromptu visit to this famed restaurant. We reached early before the crowds and could get a table almost immediately. We were seated next to the windows and I noted that the tables were quite close together. We ordered 3 main courses - roast beef salad, lasagna, and truffle risotto. All 3 dishes were of very good quality, delicious, very typical of good homely Italian cooking. As for desserts, the vanilla ice cream brownie was excellent. Service was relatively fast and efficient. Worth coming back again

For more reviews, visit my site at ms-skinnyfatI'm but a little in visiting Jamie's Italian at Vivocity Singapore since their opening in July, but the long queues and the lacklustre reviews just made it too easy to put off. But don't write Jamie's off just yet! A recent visit to sample their updated menu left me walking away satisfied and looking forward to the next visit.Just four months into Singapore and the restaurant has added 15 new dishes from the UK menu which includes some seasonal produce. Most of the dishes we tried were the additions but i also made it a point to order some tried and tested dishes. I couldn't resist the newly added Crab and Avocado Bruschetta ($14.50). A thinly crisped sourdough is topped with green apple sticks and crab that has been mixed with natural yoghurt, mint, parsley and chillies. Spread a little of the smashed avocado (ripe avocados blended with basil, lemon juice and red chilli) and whipped buffalo ricotta (blended with brown crabmeat and lemon juice and zest) and pop it whole. The flavors are guaranteed to blow you away.We went with another new addition, the Simple Baked Lasagne ($24). Trust me, there was nothing simple about it. A rich and tart ragu of minced beef and pork, is cooked for 2.5 hours with red wine, tomatoes, and stock. This is layered between Jamie's homemade lasagne sheets, with sweet roasted squash (LURVVE) and a thick and silky béchamel sauce. Finally it's baked with a tomato and basil passata, and finished with grated Parmesan and a fresh rocket salad. While the pasta sheet was quite dense and raw-ish (apparently very Italian), i enjoyed the combination of a tangy and chunky sauce and the sweet pumpkin. It's a little dry but it's awesome.The highlight of my meal was undoubtedly the 30 Day Matured Prime Rib ($59.80), a 350g Angus breed bone-in strip loin served with wild mushrooms and peppery endives. The juicy slab is cooked on the grill al Mattone which seals in the juices. Go for the pimped version (add $5) for a disc of truffle butter and shaved black truffles. The medium rare version was absolutely bloody and buttery and extremely savory, just the way i like it.If you love chocolate, forget everything and just order the Epic Brownie ($11.50) with amaretto ice cream and caramelized amaretti popcorn. Made with 70% cocoa solid chocolate, this was super gooey and rich. I could taste a hint of salt which brought out the intense chocolate taste. Sweet and savory anytime! If the brownie were warmer and the ice cream less icy, this would be the ULTIMATE dessert.The Raspberry Frangipane ($9.50) is a nice complement to the sweet brownie with the tart raspberries and nutty almond filling. The center was a little too soggy for my liking but the outer crust was nutty and crunchy. Yums. Now if they could work on the overall consistency of the texture. Another area of improvement would be their drinks. My Florence Fizz ($16.50) tasted like cough syrup and i sent it away after 1 sip. The Ginger beer ($6.50) was spicy but dilute. So go to Jamie's Italian. I was won over really. Just make sure you make a reservation (only for groups smaller than 7pax

The restaurant doesn't really live up to the hype - but ignoring all that anyway, some good standouts on the menu. Order the steak w truffle butter, and the veggie side dishes. Ironically - the pasta dishes are the ones that need the most work

I went to Jamie's Italian at Vivocity last night, this being my second visit. There were four of us in our group, we shared a 'meat plank' and a 'seafood plank' to start, and both of them were excellent. Nicely plated with an interesting and diverse range of offerings. Especially good was the Beetroot-cured salmon gravlax, and the 'perfect' olives are truly remarkable!We followed these two huge planks with the amazing Farmers Sausage, which was as delicious as it is visually stunning. A slightly coarser style sausage, well seasoned, and strongly flavoured with garlic and spices. Nicely set off by the agrodolce peppers and onions.Also the Panzerotti with chicken and mortadella was both delicious and interesting. the creamy sauce was complimented well by the crunchy pancetta and fresh cucumber.The meal was washed down by a few of their bespoke Italian-style beer from Archipelago, which really hit the spot.Finally, big thanks to the service staff. They were all extremely competent, knowledgeable, friendly and professional. Despite the restaurant being full, and tables being turned over, no-one looked to be stressed or rushing, and non of the service was hurried.I will definitely being going again

All disappointing, below expectations.All dishes poor.Service slow and disorganized.bad experience....................

My daughter and I were very disappointed with our experience at Jamies. The service can best be described as 'organised chaos' and the food did not meet our expectations. We ordered a simple meal of pasta, bread and salad and thought that nothing could go wrong. The pasta came out first, we had one entree portion and one main, the entree portion was tiny, and the main not much better. We then had to wait, and wait some more for the bread and salad to arrive. By that time our pasta was cold, oily, and not particularly appetising. We both left the restaurant still hungry
4
We had lovely meal, in a good setting, with attentive service. The food was presented well and flavorsome. Great value for money and enjoyed the experience. This place mets a niche in Singapore, that is not hawker, food hall, chain restaurants or fine dining. Would highly recommend for either groups, couple or walk in if you at vivo city. We will be back. Thanks

There were enough bad reviews on the food here and I fully agreed that the kitchen produced one of the worst western food standard I had tried. Just a few examples: the seafood pasta was watery and tasteless The lamp chop was bland and felt microwaved. A very poor execution of one of the celebrity chef's projects. While I was very disappointed with the food quality, I did find a couple of things that they had done very well. They scored A for the food presentation. See my pictures and you know what I mean. The dishes really looked yummy and we were really excited by them until we taste them. Another plus was the ambient and it had great vibes. I will definitely not come back for the food but I may come back for their home blend beer and relax by the waterfront
1
The food was bland and seemed to have no seasoning at all. The waitress who looked after me was very sweet and attentive but staff kept resting on the back of the couch that I was sitting on, at one point there were four people practically sitting on my shoulders. I complained to one of the chefs who couldn't have cared less. I told the waitress to cancel my dessert, she quickly took this off the bill. If you know Singapore this type of request usually takes a huge amount of effort, the ease with which this was done suggests that this wasn't an exceptional request. As I was leaving I spoke to the manager, he made slightly more effort to pretend he cared but sadly didn't really pay attention until he realised I live in Singapore and wasn't a tourist. Overall a very typical Singapore experience, overpriced, mediocre food, dreadful serviced
2
Well you might go there just because it's Jamie Oliver but we certainly did not find that good enough.The place obviously is still green at the edges and it shows - service is patchy and confused, food is mediocre and confused and the place itself looks confused between a diner and a italian cafe.Staff is ill informed ( don't know what a decanter is ?!!) and not flexible ( no special requests ). The good itself was very so-so and given the plethora of very good italian places in a similar price range ( Modesto's anyone?) they better spruce up fast- SG food scene is pretty ruthless!Maybe with time these will improve but for now it was pretty disappointing. Well maybe just because it's Jamie we will try again in a month

Lunch here on Dec 8 with family. Would not return as food is yucky and overpriced.Restaurnat decor is nice, but a bit cramp.Staff very busy but we juz waited 5mins for a table.We ordered quite a few dishes, but overall everything is either too salty or tasteless! It's a great disappointment! For the price we paid, we would get a decent feast elsewhere. Do not patronize them unless you have no where to spend your money!

I have tried to book at this restaurant for the past 2 sundays. I tried to book online but could only get a table for 1, I phoned only got recorded message, so left a message on Sunday 1st dec, still waiting for a reply. Tried again to book for Sunday 8th dec to book online, just got a message to say sorry not able to do this. It was for a party of 6, so don't want to just turn up as you may be full.I am sorry this is not a restaurant review, but you have to be able to book a table to do the review. When I emailed my problem I got an email to say they will reply in 3 working days. Not good enough Jamie needs to go to this restaurant and sort it out

I have visited twice, once for business during the week and once with friends at the weekend. The business meal where the staff were not overwhelmed was allot better than the Saturday visit where both the food and service was poor.It's a real hit and miss affair but don't go expecting fine dining, you pay the cost but don't get the quality of food or service. I had to send my veal back after three mouthfulls of chewy meat meant it was unedible. To my surprise the manager came over to tell me that she had tasted it and it was fine! I said it's like chewing gum as you can see from the three bits i had to spit out as they were not swallowable. She relented and took it off the bill but what happened to the customer is always right? Why would i lie about a dish I was looking forward to which was her implication?I actually loved the tuna pasta and lemon meringue pie along with the tasty plates for starters. However all my friends complained that the pasta dishes were bland, other dishes had too much oil in and starters were poor Overall the three of them thought it was nothing special and didn't live up to the hype or expectation of a celebrity chef.I would say it's somewhere you go when the hype has died down and you don't have to book and treat it like a similar restaurant in Vivo i.e. don't have any great expectations and enjoy the desserts

Dined at Jamies Italian for our end of year ladies book club lunch. As we were a largish group (9) we were very pleased to note we were given the private dining room. This room is very well appointed and relatively quiet when the doors are closed. We were all looking forward to enjoying our lunch experience at Jamies, but unfortunately we were sadly let down by very disappointing service. We ended up pouring our own drinks and waiting an inexcusable amount of time for all courses. I resorted to speaking with the manager directly to ask for some service. The food here is quite good, but unless the service improves return custom is unlikely
3
Foods ok but nothing to rave about and certainly not worth the 90min wait to get a table! Wouldn't rush back but may try again if in Vivo and there's no queue

The polenta chips was da bomb! It was the menu item I will definitely go back for. Crisp shell hides the melting soft and well-seasoned polenta, served piping hot with a sprinkle of Parmesan and rosemary. I love polenta (although I generally hate corn); too bad not more places serve it in Singapore.We were considering the plank and pasta, but looking at the next table, the plank serving was rather puny for the price ($15.50 before taxes and service), and the pasta looked sad. That said, my friend decided to order a small pasta anyway. We shared the spaghettini with crab as a starter, which was tiny for $16 before tax and service. The pasta was fresh, but lacked flavor and cooked just slightly past al dente. There was not much crab to speak of, and the sauce was watery, undersalted, and pooling at the bottom of the bowl (I hate watery sauce!!). Not recommended. My fresh handmade pasta and sauce is MUCH better.My friend and I decided to go with the 30-day matured prime rib (with truffled butter and sliced truffle, extra $5) which was rather pricey but worth every penny--$59.50 without the truffle, before tax and service. The minuscule slice of truffle was dry and gritty, no truffle fragrance at all, not worth $5. The rib was perfectly cooked as ordered (medium rare), tender and seasoned well. There was a big piece of gristle and a thumbnail-sized bone that was not supposed to be there, though. The salad on the side was respectable. It was served on a humongous wooden chopping board, about five times the size of the steak, what a waste of space and perfectly good wood. Funny enough, the prime rib was listed as "Pimped rib" on the receipt lolWe also went for the daily special, porchetta with Tuscan beans and salad. I wish the beans were more tender, but they were flavorful. The porchetta was melt-in-the-mouth tender and well-seasoned. The skin could have been crispier and more tender, though--it was more like trying to chew on a leather sofa.We had a Rossini (prosecco with mashed strawberry), very delicious, and a glass of Italian red, Faggio, very mellow. As dessert, we shared a Tiramisu. Not enough coffee flavor, too much orange peel/flavor. This was my first successful walk-in. The first time I tried to walk in with two friends, they turned us down because the fourth person is not there yet. Hello??? You'll have to give us a four-top anyway, why couldn't you seat three first? Very douchey move. We walked off without another word.This time we got seated right away (by the same douchey door boy), but we got a fab server (name on receipt says Apollo!).Like I said, I'll be back for the polenta

Had squid ink and red snapper. Squid ink taste fishy. I think skinny pizza shop has nicer squid ink. Added pepper, the taste was better. Luckily, we only only the small portion (for kids). Red snapper was flesh. Total we spent $56. I think I won't try again. Certainly not worth the queue

Was not expecting much after hearing of long waits and average food but we were pleasantly surprised by our first visit last week. Yes we waited about an hour for our table but what helped is the estimated time given, an sms to inform us when it was ready and good shopping at Vivocity to distract us. We ordered the bruschetta which was a special that wasn't on the menu and it turned out different from the usual. Came as a long, narrow piece of crisp bread topped with cheese, tomato and other goodies that was a delightful appetiser. Jaime's walnut salad was light and tangy - a nice combination of crunch and veggies. We also discovered why the tuna fusilli is Jools favourite as it was unique and delicious. We ended our meal with the tiramisu, another excellent choice. Remember to ask for the specials as it sounded like there were a few gems

Just when I thought that the hoo-haa over this restaurant has died down and decided to venture out to try it myself, I realized I was dead wrong.Being silly and wanting to try this place on a Friday night (of all nights), I was happily amazed that there was no queue. Lo and behold, the queue was only to 'log' your reservation and you had to wait for your table. I was dismayed to see that there were plenty of people before me who had queued and were probably shopping around vivocity. Nevertheless, I 'logged' my reservation for 2 as well. We were starving and waited for an hour but didn't receive any text from the place. Hence, we decided to try some place else.Next try, we came on a Monday night and guess what, we only waited 30 mins max!Our food however took quite a long while to come as we saw that diners who came after us had already started their meal. We asked the server to check and the next thing we knew, he brought us an appetizer on the house called "OUR FAMOUS POLENTA CHIPS" which was incredible! The chips wasn't really chips and it simply melted in your mouth. Perfection achieved!To see if the food was up to expectation, I ordered the ordinary Tagliatelle Bologanise (S$22), normal size. Seemed a bit pricey as the portion was small but food quality was passable to me. Wasn't a WOW that I would expect from the vibe that this place has generated over the past few months. Our appetizer of Fennel & Orange Salad came in a very sad-looking portion. The dish looked so unappetizing that my remark was "...is this really the kind of thing they would serve here? just a few leaves and orange peel thrown together. Oh Gosh!" It looked like something I would put together from a 2-star hotel buffet spread. My advice is not to order this dish, there are better appetizers on the menu.We wanted to try the Tiramisu which was apparently their key dish but we were stuffed from dinner and decided on the simple dessert of Affogato. Though simple (Coffee and ice cream), it was perfect in its combination - we thoroughly enjoyed it!I would need some time before I would be willing to try this place again. But next time, I would try the mains!Tip: Come on a Monday night if you want to try this place! Fastest service guaranteed

This is my review after being twice to Jamie's Italian restaurant in VivoCity Singapore. It just seems unbelievable to attach one's name to something and not ensure that basic restaurant standards are met. Our second visit was for dinner on the 20th of November 2013 for a party of eight. My first visit was about 3 weeks earlier. My first visit was for lunch for two. The food was average but the service is another story. The restaurant was not even full and the waitress who actually took our order asked if we wanted dessert and coffee. I reminded her that she had only served us appetisers and not yet the main course. She gave me a look like it was my fault and walked away. The second visit was a confirmation that I would never go back to this restaurant and urge readers to look somewhere else. The waiters seem to all be in a really bad mood and indifferent to guests. The manager was more comfortable walking around seemingly doing nothing rather than dealing with the guests. I asked to speak to him and all he said was so sorry and literally walked off. The food can one by one and the difference between the main meal for the first person in our table and the 8th was well over an hour. No apology and dirty looks when we enquired what was happening. At least if the food was good it would have somewhat made up for the bad service. The pasta was overcooked, the steak was tough and the appetizer's were all average

ReservationsI like that you can make reservations though their website, but the date I wanted to booked for was grey out. And so was the whole month of December.So I tried calling during the day and to my surprise the call was diverted to a recording machine asking me to leave a message. I did received a call back but was told that there were no available tables and to walk-in instead. And then I received another call a week later, asking me I had called them. So, was there no system to trace the calls at all?Dinner ServiceI went at the restaurant hours before dinner time, wanting to try for a table. Was told again to return for walk-in which I did and I got the bar seats because that was available ones.The menu was reasonable and so was the price.Rock glasses on the table was turn up but no water was filled. You have to ask for them to serve you water, that was for my table and the other tables I observed. So, why bother to turn the glasses up when you don't serve?2 of the menu items that I wanted to order was not available, which was a disappointment as I was there early and did not expected that.The restaurant had also made a blunder. The pepper shaker that was on our table was filled with with salt! Seriously? There are quite a number of service staff walking around but as I was sitting at the bar counter, I saw plates of ready food items left sitting there for more than a minute before someone bothers to serve them. Where is the food runner?FoodI don't think the food was good. The Epic Brownie was really rich but too much of it makes you sick.Overall, I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon because the food was not good, the service was average and the place is crowded

Been to quite a few different Jamie Italians one in Dubai, Leeds and Nottingham. Now Singapore, but once again was not disappointed food was brilliant and tasty as ever. Brilliant atmosphere nice little touches and nice to see he used local meats and ingredients like he does back in England

Four of us came for a late lunch on the weekend around 2:30pm and basically walked straight in, no queue at all. The outside area was closed but we requested to sit outside and were accommodated (far too cold inside) We enjoyed our shared starters, meat plate, polenta chips, risotto balls, gnocchi, bruschetta. I had a small pasta with prawns, would have loved it to have had some kick as it was a little bland. My friends pasta with the chilli and breadcrumbs definitely had some kick. My other friends burger tasted great, the patties had a nice charred taste. My husband had the pork sausage and enjoyed it. You're paying for the name Jamie's right? Our expectations were not high based on the reviews but it was fine. Singapore is not a cheap city and Jamie's serves it's market pretty well. My preference is to have tapas style starters and if I go back that's what I'll stick to

I had dinner there after my trip to Sentosa Island. Being a fan of Jamies Italian located in UK, I really missed the food and decided to try one in Vivocity, Singapore. Unfortunately, I was dissapointed.The staff was nice but made me wonder if they genuienely are.. having them to keep my credit card before serving ( is this a common custom for a restaurant in Singpore? Please do tell me), not once in my life have I ever been in a restaurant asking me for them to hang on to my credit card, as a customer, I felt that I'm not trusthworthy or even worthy enough to be in this restaurant for singapore standard, a classy one. Well, fyi, in UK, this suppose to be a relaxing place to dine in! Food.. the black angel patsa with black squid which I love back in the UK...is a total let down.. salty and some taste elements are missing. I do love the lemonade tho. OVERALL, with the food and service given, its not worth the cost.

While visiting Singapore this time I decided to eat at Jamie's Italian with great expectations. We were seated quickly and the staff is very friendly. Only issue was concerning food I do not eat, shell fish, asked for the shell fish not be on the plate, by the third time they got it. The choices were limited and they did not seem too eager to prepare something off the menu. When I finally did get the right meal I expected something other then average. So in all I would say the food for taste is average, the staff is friendly, the noise level is high but all right and as for the price can't say because the person who invited to to meet them there paid. Based on this experience, will find other places next visit

The restaurant has a nice setting with outdoor and indoor seatings. The service was great. We had the specials of the day which was recommended by our waitress. The rice arancini was fantastic. My wife had the artichoke risotto which was quite cheesy and flavorful. I had the puttanesca maranelle. It looks good, however it was too salty for my taste
3
I am local to Vivocity and have spent the last few months passing the long, snaking queues winding out of the restaurant and into the mall. Apparently you cannot book a table for fewer than 6pax. Of course this is great promo because in Singapore we LOVE to join a queue as it must be good …. Right? ..whatever it is…. I shared a mushroom bruschetta appetiser with my friend and I had linguine vongole (clams). Both nice but nothing special. My friend said the same about her pasta – it was so un-noteworty (is that a word) I cannot even remember what it was. The linguine dish lacked zing …. The service was lacklustre … it was a weekday lunch and not packed out yet it seemed to take ages to get someone to notice your arm waving about. Wait staff shoud keep their heads up and at least acknowledge you. Not impressed.Of course the sea view is great but that is not peculiar to this restaurant – most restaurants on the harbourside in Vivo have a great view …. I won’t be rushing back…

So I celebrated my 16th birthday at Jamie's and I couldn't ask for more. The manager squeezed in a last minute reservation and I was served with friendly staff. The cake was probably the best and it was decorated way beyond my expectations. Overall, I really enjoyed my birthday dinner with good food, friends and my family members. Will definitely come again
5
We were there as a party of ten for dinner and it was busy but the staff handled it well. Jamies Italian is not fine dining. Having said that the menu is interesting and the food was well cooked and well presented. All of our party enjoyed their meals and we had a great time. Vivo City has not had a restaurant of this quality before and it is a welcome addtion

Whilst on a business trip I was dragged to Jamie's Italian in Singapore. It was all I had come to expect from the "mockney" (all mouth and no trousers).The menu is small. I decided to go for the squid ink spaghetti with prawns and scallops.I tell you. It is truly amazing that for $25+ they can work miracles in the kitchen. Taking a bowl of food and miniaturising it so well.The spaghetti was ok. But would fit onto a tablespoon. The sauce was watery but flavoured. But how did they shrink your prawns and scallops I hear you ask....well they didn't. I had three "pieces" of scallop cut from a single animal. And not a single prawn or shrimp in sight.To add insult to injury "Jamie's" home made. Italian lemonade was over sweet and hugely expensive.Would I bother visiting again. NO!Would I bother visiting ANY Jamie Oliver restaurant? I doubt it

Was at the new Jamie's Italian. Heard so much about it. At last am here. Overall, great food and cocktails. Their special boutique beer is a must try! The restaurant was full. Had a vibrant atmosphere. Great view of Resort world. Not mentioned good service. Something which is rare in Singapore! Overall rather expensive but worth paying. Will definite be back with family.....Soo
5
Went in for dinner in a party of 6. The overall environment seems much cooler and a bit higher end than you see in Jamies Ital in the U.K. Shared some of the platters as an appetizer and added a few other pieces everything was good as expected. Risotto balls were fantastic.Main courses were good got to try a few of the others dishes, roasted pumpkin and beets side dish and the posh fries were great and memorable. Deserts really were incredible. Too many that I wanted, luckily able to share with others, lemon meringue fantastic, the brownie tasted of good quality chocolate and rich. Panna cotta was ok but the Sour cherry bakewell was really great. Overall great experience wouldn't think you were in Singapore the service was way better than other places we visited. Wont hesitate to go back and recommend

I have been to many italian restaurants in Singapore and this was a fantastic stay in an Italian kitchen! Informal and lively, with great service, staff that are well versed on the menu, this is a fantastic restaurant to enjoy good old-fashioned Italian cuisine with a modern twist. Enjoy

It started out well enough. We arrived early (6 pm) and were seated immediately, another 20 minutes later and the restaurant was FULL! When we had tried to book online we were informed that the earliest booking available was Dec 5! They do state that they only allocate a very small portion to bookings and it is best to walk in.We were given a fabulous table with views over to Sentosa. I loved the décor of the restaurant and our server was a very friendly fabulous young lady who explained the specials and took our order. The food arrived very quickly - perhaps too quickly. I had ordered the grilled chicken and flash cooked vegetables. The chicken tasted as if it had been cooked earlier and then re-heated - you know that kind of greasy taste? It wasn't hot. The flash cooked vegetables were more like stewed vegetables & they weren't hot either. So disappointing. Then when I had nearly finished my chicken I found a long black hair on my plate.We told a server who was passing by, who then brought the manager over. The Manager (Italian I believe?) immediately told me it was not any of his chefs as they do not have long hair and they all wear hats. I looked at him with a puzzled look on my face and he then proceeded to tell me it must have been from the suppliers "because that has happened before". I could not believe it! I asked him if that meant that the food had not been washed, prepared or cooked properly then if a hair from the supplier was still in it when it reached the table? At this point there had been no apology. I told him his answer had just made it worse. He then decided an apology might help and so said he was very sorry and we wouldn't be charged for my chicken. He did offer me another wine - which I declined, but he offered us a dessert which my husband accepted. This then took forever to arrive. It was on the bill - until the server noticed and took the bill away and removed it. Overall a very disappointing evening. The Managers response was inappropriate from the beginning. I know these things happen and a simple apology is what is required and needed. The offending plate should be complimentary, as it was. But I would rather pay full price for a delicious hot meal than get a reduced price on an unsatisfactory lukewarm scary meal.When we left at 7 pm the restaurant was full and they were telling the people at the door that there would be a 45 minute wait!Top Tip : Go early : at 6 pm we got a great seat, by 6:20 it was filling up, by 7 pm they were queuing with a 45 minute wait

I came here on a Sunday afternoon for dessert. I've always wanted to try this place out for a dinner, but I happened to have a big ice-cream craving so thought to pop over.I cannot comment on the food, but the service leaves something to be desired. We were seated by a waitress and then left there with no menu, nothing, for 15 minutes. It was incredibly difficult to get the attention of any of the waitresses there, who all just seemed very intent on not looking in our direction. I think that they should learn to be more observant, especially when i'm trying to wave my hand frantically in the air for attention. My boyfriend then asked the bartender whether it was normal to wait 15 minutes for a menu, to which he said 'Yes, it's normal.' ?Anyway, he then signalled to a waitress to come over to us, and in my opinion she was the saving grace, because she was very nice, sweet and polite. She was a rather petite Chinese girl with long hair, and honestly at that point I was very ready to walk out of the restaurant if no one was interested in serving me.Getting the bill was another disaster, it took super long again because it was so hard to get anyone's attention. Also, some of the waitresses there seem to have attitude problems, I notice even when they communicate with each other, there were one or two that were constantly rolling their eyes and looking irritated when they thought no one was looking.I won't be coming back to Jamie's Italian anytime soon, and it's a pity because it's really not the food that turns me off but the service

Passed by the restaurant several times since it was invited to open here on the island by the local tourism board, but it's always the long queue that deterred me to have a go. My hunger just wouldn't allow me to wait....too long....But I think the "no reservation" way of operating the biz is a good way to let everyone have a go at the food, even if you are a ce...leb...or someone important whom I think there might be another queue at another door...Jokes aside, food was delicious. staff was friendly. prices were expected. I'd strongly recommend the Jamie's Burger and the Polenta Chips, but do ask to have your burger cut to smaller pieces. Tables are just too small and proximity between you and the next diner is just too close that one miss cue and the patty may fly into the face of the fella next to you.Claustrophobia is another thing you will have to cope with. I have to hold back a fart halfway thru the meal,for I was so afraid that the lady sitting behind me may be projectile off her seat. Her chair was literally leaning on mine....The tat of problem came from the fingerprints on the knife handed to me. It didn't take a CSI to tell me it's an oversight. Like I wrote in an email to the restaurant, I usually won't be such a b....fussy if I was dining at a local coffeeshop or on the streets of India, but I wasn't as excited as a fortuneteller to tell how the restaurant will prosper from the prints. Haven't hear from them since....Nevertheless, it's still a nice place to go to with everyone bidding me goodbye. Now THAT's something I like. I felt like home. And found out they have outdoor seatings too when I was leaving....how nice..

There is a wholesomeness to the way the food is presented and this is part of what makes this restaurant very good. Dining here is an experience. You don't just come for the food. We had a 'plank' which was placed on two tin cans for a rustic shared meal experience, the vongole taglionini- which was a little light on clams and the sausage pappardelle- which was divine! As others have mentioned the kids menu is very cleverly presented, making it interactive engages the kids to 'connect' with their food. I think it is a tad expensive for what you get in portion size and service. Service was hit and miss, but I think they will get there

Met a friend for a weekday lunch at Vivo and decided to try out the newly opened Jamie's Italian. (We visited in Jul) Line started forming around 1130am and the line was 25-30 people long when the door finally opened at noon. While the line slowly snaked into the restaurant, a server told us fish items on the menu was unavailable due to insufficient inventory at that time. A few would-be diners left disappointed after standing in line for more than half an hour. The management could have just put up a sign out front and saved those poor souls some precious lunch time. When it was our turn at the front of line, the hostess took down our name and asked us to wait at bar, warning us it could be a good 15-20 minutes wait. 3/4 of the restaurant was empty at that time but the hostess told explained that they didn't want to "overwhelm" the kitchen. Excuse me?? Luckily, my friend was heavily pregnant and after being made aware of the fact (err, couldn't the hostess see the bulging tummy??), we were seated in a jiffy. Our server, looking a little green, took down our orders a little nervously. He certainly could be a little more acquainted with the menu. Food started arriving after 15 mins. Our shared appetiser, the Crispy Squid (SGD 11.5) was nicely fried and spiced with chilli powder and rosemary. For mains, I had the Seafood Bucatini (SGD 29.5) while my friend had the Italian Wagyu Burger (SGD 27.5). The bucatini was nicely cooked to the right chewiness, tomata thyme sauce was hearty and delicious, very classic comfort food. However, the seafood (clams, shrimps) could be a tad fresher. I liked the Wagyu burger, nicely toasted sesame bun, perfectly grilled Wagyu beef patty (grill lines on the outside, juicy inside). Portions were more than generous. We also had a serving of Funky chips (SGD 6.5) and Polenta Chips (SGD 7.5) on the side. Both well fried but we would recommend the sweeter and more flavorful Polenta Chips.Stuffed to the brim, we decided to share a Warm Brownie (SGD 11.5) while we nursed an espresso (SGD 4) and a cappucino (SGD 5.5). The Brownie was simply SUBLIME, the best I have had in Singaore for a long time! Strongly recommend it! We would have loved to try the Tiramisu but the two of us simply didn't have anymore stomach space.It was overall a satisfying culinary experience. Service was earnest, though it certianly needs to iron out some kinks. That could be excused given that the restaurant has opened for only about a month. Food was hearty. Atmosphere was laid back, great for family or friend gatherings. Prices were fair given the location (Vivo) and portions. I would return time and again when the crowd dies down a bit. We noticed some al fresco tables facing Sentosa. I look foward to a dinner at one of those tables sometime

Went to this place for my wife's birthday, we'd previously tried to come here on a saturday night a couple of weeks after it opened and the queue was crazy (upwards of 2 hours) so we'd gone somewhere else that time. This time, we planned ahead and got there for 5.30 and had a drink, there was no queue at all then. It did seem to get up by the time we were leaving but nothing too bad, I guess the (undeserved) hype has died down by now.I can't fault the service here, the staff were friendly and attentive (not something you get much in Singapore as 'service' is a dirty word here) and the food came out prompty.The food, unfortunately, was distinctly average, I'd go so far as to say that my wife and I could have cooked any of it at home and made it better.For the starter we had the baked mushrooms and the risotto balls. The risotto balls felt like they'd been frozen and then fried, they didn't have a nice texture and the rice wasn't very tasty at all. The mushrooms were ok, can't complain but they were nothing special. Very bland.Mains - we had the $60 prime-rib and a large portion of the pasta, I forget the exact name and jamie's website doesn't work properly so I can't check the menu, but it has prawns and a spicy tomato sauce. The prime-rib was ok, the meat was soft but nothing special and not what I'd expect for the price, I have had much better steak at other places in Singapore. I asked for medium and it came out more on the rare-side, it was edible so I didn't complain but you have to wonder about the chefs in this place that can't even cook a steak correctly. We also ordered an $8 side of rocket salad, which was nice but worth $8? No.The pasta was bland, so bland in fact I'd say that cooking some prawns from the local wet market and a jar of dolmio sauce at home would have more taste. They have this supposed 'niche' of cooking the pasta so that it's still a little hard as though it's the way pasta should be, well sorry but I've been to much better Italian restaurants than this and they've never served me raw (let's be honest, that's what it is) pasta before. The sauce had no taste, although the prawns were at least nicely cooked.The one redeeming feature of the place was the tiramisu. My wife had it and I had the tutti fruiti lemon meringue pie. The lemon meringue pie was edible but that's about all, again it was very bland and didn't have that bite of lemon that it should have. The tiramisu was excellent, and thankfully the portion was large so we could share it. If I ever went back to Jamie's I'd go back for an afternoon drink and some tiramisu, but that's all I'd recommend this place for.We also had a mojito and a blueberry cocktail, both expensive and very forgettable, the blueberry in particular was very watery and hardly has any taste of blueberry at all.In summary, there are far better and cheaper Italian restaurants in Singapore to spend your money on (Amici in Holland Village used to be great, although not been there in over a year now, and Basilico at the Regent hotel is consistently good) that don't rely on the name of a gimmicky mockney chef to sell themselves, if this is the food that Jamie Oliver serves up to people then no wonder schoolkids weren't too interested in his food, he just lost a fan (my wife) and I'm sure he'll lose plenty more in Singapore if this place doesn't improve

We had a lovely evening at Jamie's. The rustic décor adds to the charm. We loved the meat platter in the appetisers and my salmon was cooked to perfection. My husband enjoyed the lamb. the kids were happy with the kids menu and we would definitely return or use the venues function room to host a party. Anu

It was so refreshing to have a waiter who knew about food and was comfortable making recommendations! There is plenty of choice on the menu even for vegetarians! We enjoyed the meat platter (it's a great starter to all share) and especially the lamb (which at $25 is well priced lamb in Singapore)! The restaurant has a nice vibe and is a good venue for catching up with friends or family. If you can't get a reservation try for the walk in option a little earlier than usual

Surprise to wait only 20 min for a Sunday dinner at Jamie's Italian restaurant at 6.30pm. While waiting, the waitress came out with a meat plank to serve the waiting customers. The baked Mushrooms is a unique must try appetizer. Service staff need more training as they just leave the bottle of wine on the table instead to pour for you. Most food have Chili as a decoration.. Overall experience... naked chef Italian food... I feel more fusion food as spicy spicy spicy.
3
High expectation ended with disappointment. Overall service was good, food was not too bad but not as nice as I would have expected. Price is on the high side. Jamie needs to buck up.

Was there early of the month for dinner gathering with the blokes we haven't met for ages. Heard so much about it and was curious not knowing what to expect. I love my Italian food and have been around the globe looking for some real authentic Italian grub. It's usually give and take situations, the food is good but the vibe is average, great staff but food was comme ci comme ca, i love the Italian Moonshine "grappa" but I didn't like the menu... well at JI, it was simply AWESOME!!! The Vibe was rocking, the staffs were "on the ball", a "homely and woody" surrounding with a touch of elegance, booze were affordable and lastly the food was as fresh as daisy. The purrrfect choice for the evening. Couldn't ask for more perhaps another glass of Proseco for the road. Definitely will go again when I am in Vivo City. Thank you guys for giving us an authentic experience that RAWWWK! You guys ther ROCK OVER THERE!!

Had a chance to dine in JI restaurants recently. The waiter suggested some great entrees to start with so we left it up to him and were not disapointed great selection . Mains were great good portion and the brownie was to die for. Service was excellent and staff knew there food. Recommend a visit when in Singapore

Had a chance to dine in this rather famous restauant on a recent trip to Singapore.Nice ambience and the staff were just so helpful and great. We had good fun discussing/guessing what the cans on table were for until the plank for the starters came. Now we know. It was a great way to start a meal which without any understatement, can be a meal by itself.Being partial to lamb, I went straight for it and it did not disappoint.Another plank came in the form of a variety of desserts. Again it was a good selection which the Panna Cotta was as good as they come.Definitely worth another visit on my next tri

Having flown in for a couple of days in Singapore for a series of meetings - it was quite refreshing to cap the day by having dinner at JAMIE'S ITALIAN. The antipasti and desserts that were served in a big paddles were indeed a FEAST, not just for the palate, but the eyes as well. For the cocktail, well, I am a mojito lover, and theirs is something i would highly recommend!!! Overall, the experience was SUPERB... Definitely coming back for more of this!!!!
5
Went to the restaurant after very highly recommended by colleagues in Singapore. No doubt that this is the best Italian food that i have tasted in years.... Have been traveled to Italy and England where cuisine and the chef from and I am sure about my reviews.... No regret....
4
We had a chance to dine in this infamous restaurant recently (located at Vivo City); and was pleasantly surprised! It's indeed yummilicious! A must try, if you are in group of 4-5, the Antipasti Planks (especially the Pecorino Cheese - OMG), as well as the Dessert Plank (simply love the tutti frutti Lemon Meringue Pie & the BEST in town by far - Genaro's Tiramisu)! For Entree, you must order their Lamb Chops Lollipops served with a creamy (i think) artichoke & mint sauce, roasted nuts and chilli - yum yum yum! Gosh...I am hungry now and want to go again! Anyhow, love its decor and ambience. Well, just don't go on a weekend - according to my friends

We saw a sign at Singapores VIVO shopping centre advertising Jamie's Italian was now open. Having heard rave reviews about his recent Sydney restaurant we had to try it out!Knowing the 'no reservation' policy and that being new it would be busy we decided to try a late lunch/early dinner and turned up around 3.00pm. Got a table straight away! Loved the menu and the wine list...good selection of affordable Italian wines and sparkling. Loved the kids menu via the old kaleidoscope? Toy...as of course did the kids!Kids meal selection was great and beautifully presented...with a little jar of healthy salad labeled 'Shake me' was a novel way to make salad fun. Kids shook it, but alas did not eat it!Loved the antipasto and entree tapas, the pasta mains were to die for..with all pasta made fresh daily on the premises. We loved it so much we went back for an (early!) dinner on our last day in Singapore. Had the burger that day and all I can say is WOW!Also be sure it try the refreshing homemade Italian lemonade....yumm!Friends of ours also visited but as they have also been to the Sydney restaurant commented that portions were smaller and not as well presented...particularly the antipasto board. I would not hesitate to recommend for a casual, cheerful and tasty meal

Had the pleasure to eat at this new eatery (recently opened) at Singapore's Vivo City, a shopping paradise opposite Sentosa Island, the man made weekend escape for many Singaporeans and the new home of Universal Studios' Amusement Park. The restaurant occupies the space of a former Italian restaurant but make no mistake, the place is unrecognizable. In typical Jami's style the restaurant instills a vibrant atmosphere (the place was buzzing, mid-week dinner) with cool designs and exceptional lighting, casual but yet stylish. You will find a bar at the entry of the restaurant (try the signature mojitos) complimenting nicely the well-thought out menu with international and local dishes. The staff is superb, friendly, attentive and well educated about the food and beverage offerings. As a starter you may want to try the "planks" which comes in three variations (meat, fish, vegetables) containing a delicious assembly of culinary delights. As you would expect there is a beautiful selection of pasta, meat and fish dishes as a mains as well as a yummy selection of sides (try the garlic french fries and the polenta - mmmh, mmmh, mmmh). Ask for the daily specials. I opted for the "fish in the bag" and was not disappointed. This all went very well with a little Chianti from Italy and we finished gracefully with a beautiful Grappa and - of course - an Affogato. Yum. If you want to give it a try please make sure to call first as I heard the place is booked 6 weeks out

Entered the restaurant and looked for staff to greet. Eventually someone came over and we were seated only to be told by another member of staff that we could not sit there. Why?? Anyway eventually got seated elsewhere and were given Menu. Kids novelty binocular menu not working. By that time other customers were shown to the table where we had been moved.Eventually got to order and waited. Definately not worth the wait Burger cold (raw) and not eatable, Fish wrapped in foil looked like a road accident and tasted like??? Kids meals not sure what it was when it came as not what was ordered. Good points?? the water served was cold. Dont waste your time going, food and service better at a Hawker Centr

Maybe we were lucky but we only had to wait 10 minutes for a table.Service, which can sometimes be a problem in Singapore was great, menu explained properly and attentive staff.Food was good, it's casual but tasty, I had the pasta with meatballs, recommend, my wife had a burger, which she really enjoyed- so much so she wouldn't let me share.Finally, unlike some other "celebrity chef" restaurants I've been to, Jamie's was not expensive
3
I had heard a lot about this and decided to visit. I was disappointed. The food is not that great for so much hype. And it is quite expensive. I wouldn't go there again because there are a lot of other places to try which are much lighter on the pocket. The service if good but hope they offer quality to match the prices

We waited for about an hour for our table - we weren't too bothered as we sat at the bar and had some wine and "bar snacks" which served as our starters. We were then fairly surprised when we went to our table (outside) that there were about 10 tables there which were empty - basically an entire section. So it made us assume that they keep a queue to make it look better than it is. The food itself was fine - the "nachos" at the bar were nice and different (but the squid was pretty poor). Cannelloni was nice, the burger was fine (not the best, not the worst). But the chips were terrible. I sent back the first portion, as they were soggy, greasy, and undercooked. Sadly, the portion that they were replaced with were just as soggy, just as undercooked, but greasier. In all, I would say that if there wasn't a queue, you happened to be there and needed food, and you avoided the chips, then it's fine. But I won't be rushing back.

I'd heard stories about the the queue time was long, and read reviews about the not so great service, so I went with managed expectations. However, everything went fine, great in fact. First, they did had a everyone-had-to-be-present-to-be-seated policy. My husband was in line and there was barely queue..but they let him in anyway when he told them I was minutes behind. We were served water promptly and handed the menus promptly and got a lot of help from the waiters and manager about the food. My husband has celiac so we needed to make sure we could order some of the stuff on the menu. On request, they served up a gluten-free penne alla norma which tasted great and were able to recommend the correct dessert options for us. Not many local restaurants are knowledgeable about celiac.My pasta was fresh and flavourful, as was the salad we ordered. The food was priced nicely and for some dishes, they had full and half portion options. The restaurant itself was spacious and had a lot of wood accents so it feels very rustic. The only things I didn't really care for here was that some tables were too closed to each other and that the music seemed a little too loud.On our way out, we saw prosciutto and crackers being offered to the forming queue. Nice touch. Definitely worth a re-visit

Had dinner with a bunch of colleagues on Wednesday night 2nd October. Great service from friendly and knowledgeable staff , excellent food and wine. Loved the music playlist too. All in all, a great time was had. Can't wait to take my family back there. I would recommend booking ahead though to avoid having to wait for a table, as they seem to get very busy most nights

Forget the other reviews I went here tonight . And the service was great and relaxed, the food was fantastic the percorino with chilli jam was so tasty. The main I had the steak salad was tasty to. And when the desserts came out I was in heaven. It's a causal laid back service the staff explains all the food. I will go back thanks guy

Would be great if Jamie would go here himself. Wonder if he would still put his name on this restaurant...... What an arroganceat the door. We didn't go for dinner. We didn't make a reservation but were told that a table would beready if we would wait more than an hour (no cues and empty tables in the restaurant.....). As it was already past eight we decided to make a reseravtion for the next night. Sorry, not possible.......!?! They told us that they had to keep a certain number of tables free for walking in...... So for us (family of six) no option to make a reservation and nearly no option to just walk in..... Positive for this restaurant is the fact that you have many options close by. Use them!!! Good luck Jamie

We tried to make a reservation online, but itwas fully booked. They advise on their website to go there as a walk inn customer. Surpisingly, no waiting (wednesday 6.30 pm)We ordered a decent sauvignon blanc for $49.50. Well chilled.The cured meat plank was great, with nice pickles and good spicy cheese.The waldorf salad was nice with beetroots.Unfortunately no complimentery bread is served.The Canneloni with pumpkins was served in a proper serving, however it failed to impress us. Also the Ravioli was dissapointing. It was served in a watery lemon brot. No taste.The atmosphere is nice but Jamie really need to step up with the taste, if hebwant to compete with a proper Italian restaurant
5
Walk up and reserve a table then head for a drink at one of the outside bars to avoid getting annoyed at the wait.Once you're in, it's fantastic. Service is friendly, knowledgeable and really unlike anywhere else at its price point in Singapore I know. The food is prompt and tasty. The wine served at the right temperature, full of flavour and kind on the wallet. We had olives, montepulciano, A meat board and the prosciutto and pear salad and pasta. Chocolate mousse to finish

I was actually shocked at how bad the food and service was at this over hyped "mall" restaurant. Long lines and a disorganized reception lead to chaos and an average of 60-120 minutes wait to get in...I can’t believe anybody would queue that long for this restaurant.This was my second visit and my last. To summarize he food was bland and cooked rather ineptly. I get the sense that the kitchen staff doesn’t care about the quality of the food nor the taste as almost ever dish that we tried was lacking in seasoning. Front of house staff seemed to too busy to keep up (perhaps understaffed) which led to requests being forgotten and long waits for drinks. Here is my review of the items that we tried:WILD TRUFFLE RISOTTO resembled congee and was tasteless paste. There didn’t appear to be any truffles in the dish and it was lacking in any flavor/oil of truffle. The dish was rather watery and appeared that whomever cooked it may not have ever eaten risotto before.TURBO PENNE ARRABBIATA The penne was overcooked and the sauce was more like a paste. Despite having chili in it wasn’t particularly spicy. POSH CHIPS were soggy and didn’t have the slightest taste of truffle. The fries were so undercooked and soggy that they actually would break up before you could get them to your mouth.SAUSAGE PAPPARDELLE rather bland an uninspired...it could have been so much better if the sauce had been richer again it felt like it was missing something to give it that wow factor.CRISPY STUFFED RISOTTO BALLS were tasteless and i suspect that the cardboard box that they came from would have tasted better.Save your money and your time and go somewhere else; where they know how to cook Italian...it would appear to me that Jamie Oliver has slapped his name on this rather sad excuse for a restaurant in the name of the almighty dollar. What a shame as I thought it might be better

No reservation so queued up,pleasent surprise nibbles came round while queuing.Got a table quickly as only large groups 4 or more in front.Front of house very knowledgeable and offered choice of two tables.Waiters were prompt with friendly efficient service.Bread fresh, mains tasty with good size portions. The tiramirsu is the best I have found in Singapore.Note the these are Italian flavours and they do not water them down for local taste which is great.If you go to Jamies you get real Italian flavours with professional servic

lined up for 30mins to get to the receptionist and another hour to have a table. We waited a table at a bar , by the time we have already ordered 3 drinks and 1 snacks - which is not actually that great. My husband ordered a burger and I ordered the pasta (Jamie's wife ate that pasta when she was pregnant). the burger was dry while mine was super salty! Also, we are not locals and we couldn't leave our phone number to them when they had a table for us that's why we had to stay at the bar
2
Been to Jamie's 3 times, hoping it would improve, but no, still very poor. Pasta dishes tasteless. Ordered Prawn Linguine and have never seen such small prawns, especially in Singapore, also had Bolognese and it had no flavour. Service very bad. Ordered bread and had to wait ages, also same with water. You have to queue for ages then they have everyone in at the same time and I don't think they can cope with the orders. They also have tables outside but do not allow anyone to sit out there, therefore people are waiting for tables. Will not be going back

My colleagues bought me birthday dinner at this restaurant last week. Despite being there 2 hours earlier to queue for a place, the restaurant simply refused to seat me till my group of 3 were all present. We tried making the reservations one month in advance but the tables available for reservation were booked till November. This is really lousy service since there were plenty of empty tables inside! I did not have such a problem when I made reservations to dine at Pollen which was owned by 1-Michelin Star Chef Jason Atherton.The decor was pretty interesting which feels like a converted warehouse look and the ambiance was good. I ordered a Rump Steak which was nicely done but that was all that was nice. My colleague's meals were nothing to shout about. The seafood was not fresh and also the service was really lacking. Most of the time, we had to keep our hands raised for about 3 mins before the waiter/waitress give us the nod to acknowledge our request for service.Again, I do not want to say much except let the photographs speak for themselves. My conclusion is that one visit is enough, I would rather go to another restaurant in the future
2
It was my 3rd consecutive Italian dinner for my birthday celebrations. Definitely the worst. My friend tried getting a reservation in person but was unable to. It was a half hour wait only to be told at the end of the queue that the waiting time to be seated was about an hour. For whatever reason, we were seated in 5min. We were recommended to try the day’s specials by the cherry waitress who was serving our table. We share a “jug” of special drink that was supposed to have some puree in it. It wasn’t anything special. We should have chosen the lemonade as intended. For starters to share, we took the baked mushrooms. It was supposed to be Swiss browns with crispy “music bread” & smoked buffalo mozzarella. Sounded yummy but the result was some slices of mushrooms on what looked like filo-pastry like base. I didn’t taste any of the smoked buffalo mozzarella.The rocket salad was salty. There was a seafood risotto listed on a board near the kitchen & the description was mouth-watering. However, it turned out to be very fishy, salty & unappetizing. My friend took the fillet of fish in a bag. The meat was little dry. There was more carbs (the fregola sarda) than the seafood.We left without bothering to trying the dessert & went to Pasir Panjang hawker centre for better food. Disappointed by the failure to deliver what was promised by all the hype

My husband and I got a walk-in sitting on a Monday afternoon. Lovely ambience and a lot of people surrounding us with delicious meals. I would have loved to have sat outside by the waterfront.We ordered crispy squid and bread. Squid was to die for but not enough and I was quite looking forward to our pastas if they were going to be anything like our entree.Was highly disappointed with our pastas... we had to wait ages and when they arrived they were BLAND.So bland that I added salt.Now Im not a huge pasta eater, but when I dined at an Italian place back in Auckland, I loved the food so much I told everyone about it and then returned the next time I was there with more friends.I did not feel this way at alp.Sorry Jamie

Few days ago, a friend of mine invited me to try the new restaurant of Jamie`s here in Singapore. The service staff was OK, but the food a very disaster. We start with a selection of cold cuts that was nothing exceptional; a Sicilian sardine bruschetta that was horrible (in this plate only the ingredient we can taste is the vinegar) and a Pumpkin and mozzarella nachos with arrabbiata sauce (this starter was not so bad except that the arrabiata sauce wasn't spicy). For main we ordered a Risotto with wild truffle. It was the worst risotto I ate in my life, It look like a porridge and it was so fare from being called Risotto. After our very quick complain, the service staff look like very familiar with this kind of problem, so after ask ''Do you are Italian sir?'' she didn't make any problem for us to change the dish. Even with the new risotto was more than overcooked. We ordered too the Jamies Italian burger witch was not so bad.Finally i never think to go back again in Singapore Jamies restaurant. The bill was around 200 sing dollar (witch a bottle of wine). To be honest I think that for the quality they offered the bill was high. NO WiFi available for customers.Hope the other restaurant around the word is not like the Singapore one otherwise the food it`s so fare to be called ``ITALIAN``

Decided to beat the forever-long queues by visiting Jamie's Italian on my day off on a mid-week at around 5pm, still, we had to wait for around a good 50mins to get my seat for 2. Right at the start, the 2 ladies at the entrance couldn't quite seem to juggle nor get the table seatings on the tablet right and for that, a good 15 mins had been wasted, waiting just to be attended to place my name on the waitlist! Thank goodness the bar counter seats were available, so we could settle down for a cocktail and the polenta chips whilst waiting for our table. I wasn't too pleased when my bowl of polenta chips was wrongly served to other patrons that entered much later than us. I had to prompt the servers in order for them to realise their mistake. When we were finally directed to our table proper, we were really famished. The fish plank was alright, nothing I would rave about. Our pasta was really disappointing! The vongole tagliolini and risotto were extremely salty, nothing close to whatever we have eaten at any Italian restaurant nor casual eatery. We conveyed this feedback when we were settling the bill and yet again much to my dismay, the staff hadn't acknowledged nor sent his or the chef's apology for such unacceptable salt-overload disappointments. I didn't receive any form of reassurance that I should perhaps 'give them another chance'! Well too bad, too much hype, brought too high an expectation and along came too big a disappointment. I won't waste my time queuing up here again.

I went there during the first week of grand opening. The queue is meters long. But an employee walks to the queue offering a tray of bread, cheese and smoked ham (and beef). Taste pretty good. Waiting time isn't long until we got the seat. We can wait on the

Finally found the time to visit and to see first hand whether this was really worth the hype.On arrival, staff and managers were friendly, seated at a table within 5. Atmosphere was good and temperature of the restaurant was just right too.Took a good look at the menu and realized that the starters were a bit on the pricey side whereas the prices of the mains were okay.Nevertheless, we ordered a fried squid, baked mushrooms and olives on ice to start. For the mains, we had a small portion of a bolognese and a prawn linguini.The small portions were adequate enough to fill one's stomach despite being 75g only. The taste however was disappointing. Despite the al dente pasta, the flavours weren't enough to wow me like that of the starters.Overall still a good meal fix but not extraordinary

Well, it's my first time eating at a celebrity chef's restaurant, so I don't really know the standards provided by these kind of restaurants. But from my experience here in Jamie's Italian Singapore, I was utterly disappointed.No. it's not that bad. but as you can see from the overall rating that I've given to this restaurant, it's average, and I was not expecting that from such a famous celebrity chef like Jamie Oliver. I've tasted better, way better, Italian food from many other restaurants, and for better value.Okay, here we go. I ordered the Baked Mushrooms, Tagliatelle Bolognese, Jool's Favorite Sicilian Tuna Fusilli, and a pitch of lemonade. The Baked Mushrooms were my favorite of all, mushrooms seasoned with salt & pepper and a couple sprigs of thyme, placed on top of a thin crispy bread, and topped with melted cheese. Seems nice, right? But still, for me, it lacked of taste, the salt & pepper were barely add up to the flavor, resulted a rather tasteless mushrooms. But still, this was my favorite.The Tagliatelle Bolognese, the tagliatelle was cooked al dente, which is the way I like it. But it's not the pasta itself that I was disappointed about, but it was the flavor, again, the lacked of taste. All I could taste was the tomato, the same with the fusilli dish. Should have added more herbs, more salt, more pepper, more varieties.But then again, I can (and should) never judge a restaurant after only one visit. Perhaps the chefs were too busy when I visited. Perhaps it was only my dishes that were lacking taste. Perhaps I had a bad luck. So in the end, there's a 50/50 chance that I might go back to this place again when I'm around, just to answer my curiosity that is still left hanging

Have eaten here twice recently. Once group of 6, then group of 4. All pasta dishes on both occasions were very tasty. Bread for starters also very good as is the chocolate brownie for desert. The service however needs to be improved drastically. Had to ask for our mountain of plates, bottles and glasses to be removed TWICE. Entrees had not been finished when mains came out! Not good enough for a restaurant with Jamie's name on it
5
I have been waiting weeks to visit. Having seen the queues I decided to wait a while and thank god I did. Food, service was amazing and the atmosphere was great.
My friends birthday desert was a real treat. Thanks soooo much Jamie.
Well done.

Had some good pastas and the burger which was huge. Service was good and the wait for meals was not too long. The brioche dessert was odd though.

Really enjoyed the menu selection, the food was made well and fresh and staff and service was efficient. Easy to get to by public transport.
Overall a good meal out.

After turning away several times due to very long lines, my wife and I finally saw an opportunity to walk in to Jamie's. front staff was helpful and fairly friendly. After about a ten minute wait we were seated. Waitress came up to explain the specials, but we couldn't understand most of what she said. Undaunted we ordered from the menu. We weren't too hungry so we ordered two pastas and he bread. I had the black ink angel hair with seafood and my wife had a creamy prawn linguini. Both were ok and the pasta was cooked well. The angel hair was superior to the linguini, but neither really were exceptional. The bread (separate menu item) was ok. Guess I was expecting warm bread fresh out of the oven. Not what we got. It was just bread. The olive oil and balsamic was really exceptional, the hi light of the meal. Sorry, don't mean to damn with faint praise but we probably will not be going back any time soon.
3
Not a very pleasant experience. First cocktails ordered came wrongly,waited almost an hour for food,even though we ordered antipasti,then food came all at one shot, together with mains-Matured prime rib, etc . Black ink pasta was extremely salty and after reminders on our serving of bread, the bread finally came when the mains were finished.Service staff kept passing food rudely in front of friend 's face instead of coming in between us. Risotto dish was forgotten even though the order was repeated.The saving grace was that they gave us dessert free to make up for the poor service, the delicious brownie and the flavorful snapper main dish
4
Went to the restaurant for a lunch on a weekday & it was packed! Had to wait 20 mins for a table but we got a nice one facing the outdoor area & water. Saw a particular dish go by us quite a few times so decided to try it. It was the Baked Mushrooms. Yums for a starter. Ordered the Italian Burger and Prawn Linguine as mains. The linguine, while the pasta was al dente and the flavour was there and was unique, the prawns were little pieces... and it wasn't very much, esp considering the price being paid for a full serving. The burger was okay. Nothing fantastic, but nothing that bad either. What was a definitely no-no was the Amalfi lemon & basil iced tea. Firstly, you could hardly taste any lemon. Secondly, there was barely a taste of tea! So basically it ended up being iced grass in taste. Total rip-off for over $5+ a glass. For desserts, we had the Panna Cotta & Lemon Meringue Tart. The Panna Cotta was ordinary, it was not bad. The tart, I'm happy to point out, was nice and tart/ sour! Others I've tried were simply sweet but this had a nice punch. It was a perfect balance of taste when combined with the fluffy meringue so this is a definite must-try. Overall, service was excellent, the food was decent albeit maybe a little pricey for the quality of items. Having tried Fifteen in London, it was of the same standard - even then I wasn't that impressed by the menu. But it is all for a good cause afterall right

Welcome promptly at the door and lead to a table in front of kitchen. Full of people who adore Jamie Oliver. Come across a table occupied by a female manager I believe who is use running thru his admin work. Occupying a table in a busy restaurant is such a waste till she is being told to excuse herself. Present a menu by Bryan. Well brief what are the restaurant speciality, I order a lemon basil iced tea. Ice cold have more. Could offer a price for drink unlimited. I have to say I have to compliment the staff HONESt recommendation. I choose. Bruschetta, pork flank and a ravioli. Presentation, serving timing is good. Good food quality. However I come across the next table incident really made me mad; a glass of beer fell onto a diner by accident. Instead of apologizing, the male manager shouted out ..... I KNEW iT! And push away the service staff. So rude. Thank goodness the diner is kind enough to resolve the awkward situation. The kitchen noise....really made your blood boiled as time goes.....shouting here and there for nothing. This gimmick does not work chef....too many people talking cause noise pollution. Stick to YES NO X-minutes chef. The brownie is wonderful. Pity that they do not utilized the private room probably. I do ask to reserve and willing to pay the rental for my upcoming birthday dinner but was REJECTED! I believe Jamie is earning good enough and don't need my business. Good job Bryan. Other server need to be more prompt. Server could check the table more often to interact with the diner to market the outlet more. If u want to expect more walk in, remove your reservation system online. With the price we pay, we expected a little more in service, ambience and touch

I have just dined at Jamie's Italian last Saturday evening (6 adults with 3 kids) and the experience left much to be desired. We arrived at 6.20pm and queued another 20 minutes to just be able to reserve a table. They had told us that a table will be available in 2-2.5hours. Since we were already there, we thought, no probs, we will have a mini dinner earlier so that the kids won't go hungry.Around 8.45pm, we were messaged that our table was ready and so off we went. As we had already had our starters at the earlier dinner, we jumped straight into ordering our mains. We had the seafood bucatini, vongole tagliolini, pasta alla norma, black angel spaghetti. Not everyone was hungry so we shared the food among the adults. The kids had ice cream as they have already had their dinner. The kids menu came in a binocular-type thing where you can click and view, which I have to admit is very cute.The verdict is that all the pastas was overcooked, soggy and for the tagliolini was tasteless (literally). The bucatini was also a little on the insipid side.Our experience at other Jamie's restaurants in the UK (London & Bath) were very different compared to this and we are naturally very disappointed. Perhaps Jamie need to re-look at the quality control in the kitchen. It may be that the quality of the food is suffering due to the long queues and high volume of patrons....

Was pretty excited about this place and it was pretty disappointing.Ordered 4 pastas, all the chips a few starters and desserts. The pastas are as ordinary as what you get in supermarket.The chips are soggy, I'm not sure if its intentional.The dessert ice cream has ice on it and taste like those you get from minimarts. All those for $170. Not that impressive

We ordered a glass of Prosecco (you know the fizzy stuff or at least I thought!) and it was flat - not a bubble to be seen. Upon pointing this out to the head waiter and asking how long had this bottle been open the response was "2 days". I was a bit surprised and asked is this normal practice - He said yes " it is just luck whether you get flat Prosecco or fresh". Reluctantly he changed the glasses and we thought this is perfect finally we are ready to eat! Then our main came out - it was the wrong order...when we did finally get the right order the polenta chips were stale. They must have been cooked hours ago and our main was very disappointing. Overall we were really throw at how bad an experience it was. It is such a shame as the setting is stunning - this could really have been a funky, relaxed place to go for dinner but alas we wont be back

These guys don't have a clue on what is Italian food. Pasta overcooked, watery ravioli, sauce so salty I will be drinking all night...
3
Went with a group of 10 of us. We tried all the planks, bruchetta, and ordered 10 different kinds of pasta plus the prime rib. I liked the seafood plank, did not fancy the bruchetta and liked the mushroom ravioli very much. The rest of the pasta was average and would have preferred the pasta to be more al dente. Finished off with everyone having a taste of the aged prime rib which was food. For dessert, we liked the passion fruit sorbet. Tiramisu was nothing special

On a recent visit to Singapore my wife & I visited the newly opened Jamies Italian Restuarant for dinner. The service from the waiter was slow although after placing our order the food came quickly. The food was tasty but wouldn't say its the best Italian we've had over the years.As the restaurant had only been open about a week we would certainly give them another chance next time we visit Singapore

Recently went to Jamie's Italian in Singapore for a friends 30th birthday.Large restaurant with plenty of space. Views over the waterfront with tables near the back. Diverse selection of tables, large, small, high bar style.You can book a table if there are 6 or more of you, apart from that its turn up and hope they have space. Private room available if there are 12 of you.Modern interior, wood tables and chairs. Once again my gripe are the chairs, they are quite uncomfortable after 30 minutes. There was a dedicated team of servers for the evening which meant the service was smooth and efficient.We had a jug of homemade ginger beer - gorgeous and refreshing - must have.Appetiser was Pumpkin & Smoked Mozzarella Nachos - these are addictive.Mains we had - Beef & Veal giant meatball, Wild Mushroom Ravioli, Polenta Chips and Fennel Gratin. All absolutely delicious. If you have nothing else please have the Polenta Chips.The meal for two came to just over SGD$100, this didn't include any alcohol apart from the ginger beer.We visited Jamie's in Sydney a few weeks before so were a little apprehensive if Singapore was going to be as good. I was pleasantly surprised that the service was excellent, and the quality of the ingredients were top notch. This usually isn't the case in Singapore as the meat dishes are normally very poor in restaurants.Cons:Uncomfortable Chairs10% Service charge added to your tab when you were at the bar buying your own drinksThe Italian Bread Selection with Olive Oil was Complimentary in Sydney - Singapore costs $6.00Pro's:Great AtmosphereExcellent ServiceGood Selection of Italian FoodGreat IngredientsPrices are not too bad for Singapor

The place has just opened and frankly has some teething issues, mainly related to quality of staff and running of front ofhouse. There appear to be LOTS of staff who all look very busy and are polite etc, but they need better training to ensure food orders are taken properly, that meals are delivered together with sides and that they are easily available when the customer needs something else- another drink, some pepper or the bill etc. To be fair, some of the staff were excellent and clearly were experienced at customer service, but it felt like many of the more junior team members really didn't know what they were doing. We came early (530pm) as we couldn't book. The staff kindly accommodated us and found us a table for 6. The children's menu is good and has the fun of the kids choosing their own meals using a binoculars/viewing box type of thing! Can't remember the proper name, but those of you born in 60s will recognise them! The kids food was good, tasty and they really enjoyed it. Jamie's homemade lemonade went down a treat. They have the usual colouring pens and paper for the little ones, which is pretty standard now. We ordered our mains. Take note, chips etc are not standard so you have to add them on. Our waitress didn't mention that and so when our mains arrived, we found ourselves in that familiar situation of ordering extra chips and eating slowly so they would arrive in time! The food is good, not excellent, tasty and wholesome. It isn't cheap though. A good 10-15% extra for the Jamie brand versus similar grub. Is it worth it? Not yet convinced to be honest. The ambience is fun with great disco/pop music playing and nicely decorated interior. NB: the linen napkins are NOT free to take home. We checked!Overall average to good, with some teething issues to start. I suspect this place will be better run in time. Judging by the queues outside when we finished, the excitement and buzz around Jamie's brand will carry this place through the next couple of months or so, but attention to detail will determine whether the early triers will come back or not

The restaurant is superb and lively. The staff are all attentive and proactive. They know their product well. And are very warm. Kids are catered to exceptionally. The menu is vast and the food tastes great. After dinner the mall is superb to walk around. Mexcellent for kids.m and very romantic at night for couples
5
One word of advice - until the hype calms down try to eat late - have a late lunch or a late dinner so you avoid the queues. Other than that, the food is fab, great service, great drinks, great vibe, great for kids and not a bad price either...well...not bad for Singapore! Enjoy

Jamie Oliver is a favorite, both for hubby and me. So when I learned that Singapore has Jamie's Italian at it's very shore, I immediately told my husband that we shall have his celebrated there, and hubby readily agreed with a huge smile on his face.We came a little past 7 pm and there was a long cue already which didn't bother us at all. When we reached our turn to be attended to at a little past 8 pm, we were told if we were still willing to wait for another hour to be . Again, we didn't mind. It was my husband's birthday and we wouldn't want to ruin our night.We were asked to wait at the bar just at the main entrance. A server came up to us and asked if we wanted to have some drinks while waiting, and we had some lemon & basil iced tea. Nothing special about the drinks. I noticed a couple who came later than hubby and I were also asked to wait. However, the one in charge for having the guests seated didn't seem to coordinate well with the person attending to the cue. He immediately assisted the LATECOMER couple ahead of hubby and I. Had I not seen it and reacted, maybe it would have taken a few more latecomer couple to have been seated ahead than us.Food was just fine, especially the pasta I ordered which was Prawn Linguine. Husband liked the Jamie's Burger but it was nothing to die for.It was a pleasant experience but not one to rave about

- Nearest mrt to reach here would be Harbourfront station- Food is healthy and good.- Locals may find the portion of food insufficient. Prices not equivalent to food portions.- For Caucasian, it should be just nice.- In singapore context, prices are slightly above normal dinning prices.- Since they do not accept table reservations, lines of q are formed outside the restaurant. (I waited for an hour or so). Staff will take down your name and contact and diners will be sent an sms when table are ready.- Napkins are free for take away! Good advertising idea!I will be back again

We went by high recommendation and heard lots about the hype surrounding the opening.We couldn't get through the phone (why put a number if you don't intend to answer it...) and online reservations were not available till mid Sep !So we came for a walk-in booking and were pleasantly surprised to be sms-ed after an hour even though we were told it would take 2 hours.Music was bit too loud and not exactly what you'd expect from an Italian restaurant.We ordered and the cutlery was placed. Afterwards there was some sort of a steak knife put at my side which was meant for my relative next to me but no one said what it was for, so it ended not being utilized at all whole evening.The food came relatively fast but as we asked all (starters/mains) to be brought at the same time, we only realized later that we were missing one main. Halfway through, the last main eventually arrived.Overall the food was good but definitely not excellent. The so-called fresh orange juice was fresh but very diluted, the fresh juice was most probably left in a jug with ice cubes.We had problems attracting the staff's attention to the end that we had to shout to be heard/seen.Sorry Jamie but this "Italian" very definitely does n.o.t live up to your "15" in every standard !!Disappointing, sad and for now very definitely not worth spending so much with some other Italian Restaurants in town delivering top quality in every way for same amount..
