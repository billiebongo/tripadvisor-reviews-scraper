A small yet hip bar at waterloo center. Service was prompt and staff was attentive. Ramen was good too

Little ramen bar tucked in a small alley on Bras Basah near the design center. The Sumo ramen with everything (beef pork etc) is super delicious and out of this world. The place is small and cozy and if there is no space at the table, hit the bar. It’s better

Tucked away in a sleepy block of flats is this gastronomic gemThe tomato salad was refreshing paired with the 600g ramen The ramen and broth tasted great and uniquely different from other ramen placesThe foie gras and meat don did not disappoint eitherRemember to order the matcha gula melaka I’m definitely going back to taste the rest of the menuPlease note. Make a reservation by e mail the day before. The place fills up quickly after 7.

~I shall Return!~Celine suggested I try Howard Lo's new eatery at Waterloo Street and showed me her photos to whet my appetite, just 2 weeks old too!~making my way there on Sunday 5.30pm (more on this later), it was relatively light parking by the roadside in front of Block 262 (you wanna remember that). to the right is 261 but you will find Sumo Bar Happy under 262 locate "COZi Hut" in green and walk straight ahead just a little ways in you will find it on the left, when opened you can't miss it since 3/4 of it's wall is an open Window!!~there aren't many tables or seats but there is a good bar stool counter top maybe seats 10 or 20 standing...~Normally it opens 5pm-2am except Sunday when it's open 12-5pm. On this exceptional Sunday it was supposed to already be closed at 5pm but a fluke event kept it open and by SHEER Luck I was able to have a meal here :)~the waitress (maybe Crissy?) & waiter where both very friendly and I'd no issues getting the recommendations yet I'd coincidentally ordered much the same since the names jumped out at me from the menu :)~the question of Sake popped up as a to go with and while I was thinking the appetizer arrives and a different lady, a more happy version of any wait staff appears to tell me about the batter not being it and that the chef had stretched the chicken skin over the seaweed and that the refreshing mayo looking dip wasn't a sauce, yet it will help bring out the taste AND make it less "Jelat" (loosely translated as too much)~she proceeded to talk about the Ichimi Togarashi (dried red pepper flakes) being homemade instead of the normal 7 spices, they'd 10 spices and theirs is roasted for an aromatic & zingy taste :) when my Mini Loco Moco Don arrived, she told me that the Luncheon meat was entirely a homemade recipe & I find out later she's "Nan" (as in Nancy) the wife of Howard :)~just about halfway tucked into my first bowl, in comes Howard who nudges me as if to check if I'm real and I jumped up happy to see him pop by although it will all make a lotta sense as it goes... he told me about the strange numbering of the building (yes not so normal Singapore), about the prior tenants especially about the baker who knocked out the walls to make an open window which he kept, the closing hours on Sunday hence the surprise! the omg commissioned painting of the 5 cats, his cats, to remember Miso/Terror/Comic/Frank & Sumo whom this restaurant is fondly named after... yes it's Sumo Bar Happy exactly as written.~Howard also let on that this restaurant was always his chef's dream to be able to experiment with new dishes to put on menus and that a new menu was upcoming already~as it went, Howard used to live right above and even today lives just across the street, so he could really just pop by anytime :)Yuzu Pepper Chicken Skin Chips - WOW simply delicious DDMT YUMz x2Mini Loco Moco Don - the luncheon meat and don't forget the sauce at the bottom of the rice bowl to mix! YUMz x2Mini Char Siew Don - comes with a side dish of raw egg yolk and soy vinegar sauce that when mixed with the rice made it absolutely sumptuous with that melts in my mouth char siew YUMz x3Beef Taiyaki Sliders - ooh mini Taiyaki's with super taste pulled beef YUMz~all the dishes reminded me of tapas, you won't feel like you've eaten too much at all!100% RECOMMEN

Ramen. Sake. + Ramen was tasty. Free flow eggs!! We had both the 600g and the sumo, but felt the sumo was better value for money with a large selection of meats. The 600g was good portion of meat but- The 600g lacked noodles for 2. Could have eaten it by myself. +handmade chilli powder. +handmade luncheon meat (locomo Don) with foiegras and sunny side up quails egg was tasty too. Foiegras the highlight for me (duck not goose) and a decent size.- But the quails egg was only OK and the luncheon meat texture was more corned beef to me. - space rather limited. So make a reservation. Pro-tip: reserve the 600 when you make your reservations. They only have 5 portions per day. Make sure ur reservations are not too late as they could accidentally sell out even if u reserve. Same chaps that run standing sushi bar and tanuki... So they know Japanese cuisine.
