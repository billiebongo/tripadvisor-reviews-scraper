We were in Singapore for a few nights to visit friends. Knowing how much we lovePeking Duck they suggested this place. They had to order the duck in advance. When we arrived the issue was with the service. It was a bit hard to get a servers attention. Then, the server was not of any real assistance with the menu which was a bit overwhelming. We decided on some fried rice, beef chow fun and a veggie dish to go along with our duck. When the duck arrived it was carved table side and portioned out and folded into the pancakes. It seemed to us that there was definitely more meat on the duck. We had enough and it was tasty but not the best I’ve ever had. The pancake was light and not overpowering. The other dishes were very good. This was during Chinese New Year so that may have effected our visit.

It is a nicely decorated restaurant with friendly service staff located at one of the posh shopping malls. The braised foie gras appeared to be over-cooked for a few days with its supposed to be silky smooth texture turned into like a roughly boiled pork meat. The taste was substandard too. (This chef should learn from the Imperial Treasure restaurant at the ION shopping mall which has been consistently serving perfectly braised foie gras.)The ‘Buddha Jump over Wall’ soup costing over $165 per bowl per person was over priced with substandard-quality ingredients. The soup is lack of flavor despite the use of expensive ingredients. The only tasty portion was the Chinese ham which remained salty. We also ordered a bowl of fish bladder soup boiled in concentrated shark bone which was well prepared and tasty. The pig’s trotters braised with dried oysters, Chinese club moss and cabbage was a very delicious dish with perfectly braised soft pig skins in a brown oyster sauce. The crab meat braised flat noodle dish was tasteless and lack of crab meats. Overall, two of us spent over $400 for this lunch.

Mind numbingly loud. We couldn’t even hear ourselves think. Staff didn’t warn us that there an office function going on for part of the restauant. Clearly everyone else in the restaurant was unimportant and secondary. Table captains and servers were drinking on duty and screaming ‘yam seng’. Completely unprofessional.Good is great but just avoid this outlet. Go somewhere else and save your ear drums some pain and suffering

You should reserve the table instead of walk-in.Shark fin is delicious.I love porridge is awesome. Recommend!! The crab is Fresh and Sweet

Out of 6 ordered dished, there was only 1 that was a bit below the expected standard. The rest was amazingly good and we ordered sea cucumber, special soup and different dim sum...these dishes can be tricky. However, they were all well done. It is good place to go before a flight or during a stop over if you want to enjoy great food. The service was also good and meeting the food quality

here you can taste the original perfect chinesse food the service its very good and the staff friendl

Great food, fabulous ambience and good value for money if you want to have a taste of chinese cuisine & dimsum

Imperial Treasure at GWC used to be my reference of Cantonese cuisine in entire Singapore some years ago when I visited it monthly to see at what extend the trend has gone. This visit has only served me with so so dining experience that has disappointed me so much. Not only on the dishes but service as well that I can’t even recall what dishes has impressed me at all. There is too much to improve in this outlet

This restaurant is always my Top Pick whenever I am in Marina Bay Sands. The access to the restaurant is not so prominent. I always take the lift elevator beside Prada Boutique to the 2nd floor.My family all time favourite is the Peking Duck. The duck is roasted to perfection and the wraps go well with the strips of fresh cucumber and spring onions. We also liked their Signature Tofu with Vegetables, Pig Intestine Soup, Fried Beef Slices with Hong Kong Kailan. On occasions when I feel that pampering myself, I will go for their 200g odd gram Abalone or Braised Sharkfin.This restaurant is great for family dinners, businesses dinners or just with your loved ones. The quality of food is consistently good.
5
Nice gem to dine in. Superb service and great ambience. Advisable to book in advance for tables. Tons of choices of dim sum and other dishes.

The main reason we went was because my girlfriend had a big craving for Chinese food. The atmosphere and overall set up of the restaurant were nice, staff was a bit slow though. Disappointingly, I found the food to be very average, especially for the high price tag. Even more disappointing was the fact that full pages of the menu consisted of dishes from endangered species, such as shark fins and Birdsnest - disgusting
4
So the price point is obviously high. We had the set menu and removed two dishes as there was too much food: almost all the dishes were phenomenal. Everyone liked the Peking duck and starter especially the century egg. Even for the vegetables they had it in ham soup so very tasty. I did not like the bamboo clam - too little clam. Otherwise it was a great night. Service was good too. Bring a jacket as room is too cold
5
Loved watching the noodle maker , he was so fast efficient and talented. The food was so delicious, fresh well cooked, lovely presentation. Atmosphere was humming. service was fast and polite. I love this plac

I'm not used of leaving such bad comments on Trip Advisor but our evening in this restaurant was a massive dissapointment. Where should I start... First, the staff was very unpleasant. Moreover, they served starters and main courses at the same time. Three dishes we wanted to order weren't available that night: that's something I've hardly ever seen... But those things weren't the worst part. I do appreciate Chinese food. However, in this place, the food tasted so bad... It is even more shocking for such high prices... To put it in a nutshell: expensive service and food of extremely poor quality. Huge dissapointment! I definitely advise you to avoid this place
4
The dishes we ordered were all tasty, portion are small and prices are expensive. The sesame ball was my favourite.In my opinion you can also enjoy chinese dishes at some other restaurants at a more reasonable price
3
I love Baby Pork Honey this restaurant, Roasted Peking Duck is average. Prices are expensive, but this restaurant is often full. Location on the 2nd floor, above the casino. On this floor apart from the shops in the mall, there are only about 3-4 premium restaurants
4
Imperial Treasure is famous for its peking duck. We decided to give it a miss and tried their seafood dishes. We had lobster shashimi and many others. Slight disappointment with the lobster shasimi though as I felt the presentation could have been better and alsothe meat should have been cut into smaller pieces. Definitely not the best lobster shashimi that i had. The balance of the lobster was also cooked in porridge which was very tasty. The scallop which was steamed with garlic was marvelous. So was the abalone which was on promotion.Overall, we were very satisfied with the dinner. We were very well served by two waitresses who would check with us on the food served at least twice during the dinner. In fact one of the waitress even advised us that our orders placed would be more than sufficient for two persons

A must go for my family whenever we felt like having timsum. The branch at MBS boasts a superb ambience when you ve a big group. They usually house us at the bigger private rooms. The service is impeccable and the food is good, although we felt the standard have somehow dropped a little. The rice in fish broth is our standard order but lately the soup isn't as tasty as before, partly due to the fish they used. The XO-sauce carrot cake is good and well done. The crispy roast pork is another Favourite of ours. The Peiking duck is roasted to almost perfection and you must def end the meal with their trademark Liu Sar Bao where the egg yolk flows out like lava. Overall still a worthy place for a good outing with the family.

We had Peking duck and dim sum at this restaurant on Vesak Day and really enjoyed the meal. The decor was plush and intimate and the cooking was refined. Prices were reasonable given the standard of the cuisine. Make sure you reserve ahead as the restaurant is quite small, with limited seating
5
I have Yum Cha (as we call it in Sydney) on a regular basis and I absolutely love it.This restaurant served Dim Sum (same thing except the food was selected from a menu as opposed to roving trolleys). Please correct me if I’m wrong about this comparison.I can only say this was the most divine Asian food I have ever eaten. Everything we ordered or was recommended sent the taste buds into overdrive.We were the only Caucasians in the restaurant, and along with every other customer, we were treated like royalty.This is a MUST dining experience in Singapore and while the regular menu is rather expensive, the Dim Sum menu is very reasonable.I want to go back to Singapore TOMORROW!
5
-Fast service with good attitudes.
-Tasty and fresh food.
-Good variety too.
But...
- most dishes a tad greasy
- menu has no pictures
Tey to get one of the comfy booths.

We were starving and looking for somewhere to eat. Mall was packed and large queues at the restaurants and the food court was jam packed. Took a risk and walked up to L2 and found this treasure of a restaurant. They accommodated us without a reservation. Staff very friendly and efficient. Extensive menu, mostly seafood, but they have pretty much everything. Food was good
5
Snuck in for a late lunch and have to say blown away with the quality of food. Ordered steamed crispy prawn dim sum which would have to be the best dish I've ever had. Followed by Peking Duck which again exceeded expectations. Everything is very clean and beautifully presented and price is reasonable. Coming back for sure!!
5
Had lunch with colleagues and ordered the dim sum. Great quality and very authentic. Will be back for more! Keep it up
3
I tried to make reservation for 21.30hs 3 people they told me last order 22.00hs so I reserved at 21.00hs. The restaurant was almost empty and full of staff, no one smile, not even once. They were rushing us to order the food and drinks and even before the food came they were asking if we will want something else because kitchen was closing. As soon as the pekin duck was served they brought us the bill and we hadn't even asked for it!!!! we couldn't enjoy the meal as we would like to because we had at least 10 staff people staring at us making pressure for us to leave quickly. Being a restaurant as expensive as it is, this should not happen. The food was amazing, totally recommend the pekin duck and for appetizer roasted pork but the service should improve immediately.
4
This place serves one of the better Peking ducks in Singapore.Ambience is very nice.Prices are affordable.Recommended to come and try

Another fine Imperial Treasure outlet at downtown Amara Hotel Food Centre, Tanjong Pagar worths repeated patronage in Singapore. The Hong Kong noodles and finger foods along with its classic lotus seed in red bean soup dessert along with authentic Peking ducks are little something to include in one'sfond memory.Compatriates like Canton Paradise and Crystal Jade chains may need to further enhance their attractions to stay in line..
5
As always, the Peking Duck is outstanding - don't miss it. Service is prompt and professional. Decor is classy and the view from the private rooms certainly adds to the exclusive atmosphere
5
I was yearning for Peking Duck on my last business trip to Singapore, after having had a horrible experience of the pre-ordered Peking Duck at Min Jiang in the Goodwood Hotel two weeks earlier. Even though I was alone and only made a reservation 30 min before arriving, everything was perfect here. Very friendly and efficient service and the Peking duck was stunning. At least as good the Peking duck at Duck de Chine in Beijing. Of course one duck is more then one person should eat, plus I had ordered some wonderful Chinese vegetables and portion of chili prawns , but the taste and experience was well worth it. Normally a solo eater in a Chinese restaurant is an anomaly and one feels awkward, but here right from the beginning I was lead to nice 4 person semi-round niche banquet, where I found myself very comfortable enjoying my Duck extravaganza. I can't wait to comeback with a group of 4 or 5 friends to eat here again and to be able to experience more of their dishes.
5
I would highly recommend coming here. We ate Peking duck. You can only buy a whole duck which is unfortunate with 2 people but still worth the experience and the taste sensation!! First course - duck pancakes followed by a second course - San Choy bowThere was no room to try anything else but the food on the other tables looked delicious. Service was great to
5
My family love this restaurant very much! We come here every time we go to singapore. It is one of the best Chinese foods restaurants in Singapore!
5
One of our fav restaurant,
Quality food, good service, lovely ambiance,
We've joined their member too!
Love their Dim Sum!
5
We had a delicious peking duck. The service was fast (maybe a bit too fast for Westerners?), efficient and the waiters were very attentive to us. Not cheap though...
4
A local brought us for lunch and we weren't disappointed. The flurry of dishes--various dumplings and peking duck--were all timely and very tasty. The duck skin was sooo good and melted in our mouths. Try the sesame balls with cream sauce for dessert
1
We have visited this restaurant on 3rd January. When we have entered i have asked for a blanket , or something i can cover myself with, because their Aircon was going crazy. The lady that showed us the table straight away said "Noooooo", and starting pointing with her finger on the aircon saying something not in English. Okay, maybe she misunderstood me, so i try again "please excuse me, but i am very cold, can you provide me with a blanket, or maybe lower the volume of the AC?". But the lady was so persistent, she didnt even let me finish - i got interrupted with another confident NOOOOO, but this time she was also shaking her head. Ok, if for this simple request i get this rude answer, i assume their customer orientation is below zero. I am not in the mood of spending my money on checking their probably rubbish food. I left, and i am never coming back
5
All I can say about this place is - wow. That, and Peking Duck is a must. Menu, service, location are all amazing.
4
Arrived at about 21.20. Food order went in at 21.33. We had 2 different order of soup. One came first and was told the other one would need a longer time. This is a No No for a fine dine place. 10 mins later was told again that it will come soon. To our horror the main dish of prawns came before the soup. Protested but to no avail. Then the soup came together with the steam fish and fried rice. She has even recommended to order 2 individual portion of Steam fish as was normal for Fine Dine Restaurants. Really wonder if this is their way of interpreting fine dinning or they just mean Fine Cuisine. The food quality is good but the experience says it all. Expectations not met
5
Excellent service and great value for money.It was a welcome diner. We ordered many dishes and were very full and extremely happy by the time we finished our meal
4
I came here again last week after being here 4 years ago. I remember back then I was in love with the carrot cake, so we ordered again this time, and I fell back in love with it just as I was years ago! It was sooo good! We ordered so many dishes and were very full and extremely happy by the time we finished our meal.We still ordered the yummy warm egg tart to finish off. It was delicious!Definitely must try if you are in Singapore
5
We had 2 lunch meals in July in this restaurant with our big family.We thoroughly enjoyed the huge variety of the dimsum dishes there. All were delicately prepared. Excellent service and great value for money
5
Great food, great service. Beautiful atmosphere. Abalone and Peking Duck are must tries. Wine selection is awesome
3
Food quality was good, which was expected for the price they charge. Service was not up to standard for some staff, although most of them were pleasant. Had a server who tried to speak to me in English but would not understand anything I say to her in English. Spoke Mandarin to her in the end. When ordering from the manager (I assume since he's the only one wearing a suit), he was very curt and straightforward, got the feeling that his aim is to take our order, and not to make us feel comfortable to dine at the restaurant. I do not understand why they could not have the meat of the Peking Duck done 2 ways, which is what I usually ask for at various Chinese restaurants across Singapore. Ambiance was good. The Peking Duck was decent. Roast pork was good. Dim sum was just ok.However do not think that it's worth it for the price
4
We were introduced to this restaurant by my brother in law and the food was excellent. The dim sum was delicious and freshly made. We had the salted egg custard buns, as well as their signature pork buns.The harkau and siew mai were okay, but not outstanding. The cheong fun with char siew was also okay, while the char siew buns were very good.We also ordered a plate of trio meats, which was expensive at S$24 - the duck was nice, non gamey but slightly hard to chew; the char siew was nice and the roast pork ends were crispy and tasty. Service was good and the staff were quick to pour tea etc. Price wise, 
4
Dishes are of fresh & fine ingredients. Each dish was served with good timing.Receptions welcomes us with bright smiles and crews were attentive.Peaceful environment with tables comfortably spread out.Chinese Spinach with 3 eggs (三蛋芫菜) is unique and tasty.Salted egg yoke custard steam buns (流沙包) are served hot and golden fillings have very smooth texture
5
The dim sum is wonderful. The "liu sa bao" is a must-try!The peking duck is excellent too. And what is best, you don't have to pre-book if it is not crowded. I love this restaurant and will go back if I have cravings for yummy dim sum
4
Nice experience at this restaurants located in the financial area in Singapore. For those who already visited China before will like to remember the delicious food here also. They have a big variety of dishes and the service works really fast, good experience in a nice environment.
5
A wonderful lunch at Marina Bay Sands. If you're a duck lover, this is the place for you. Food was really good. There's a counter (reservation concierge) at level 1 (Expo/Convention side of the mall) that can assist you to make reservation at your desired restaurant. At the same time, this restaurant is able to take reservation via their website too. Very efficient. Food isn't overprice but do not expect a 5 stars service. Had a grumpy cat (old lady) serving my table. Others were very good except for her. It was nice that the restaurant hire older servers but they seem clueless on rules of etiquette. I don't blame her but she kind of scared me, with no warning while changing my plate by just cutting through my personal space to grab the plate. I was wearing a white top and it would be a disaster if those plate flipped over me. Anyway - do order the Bamboo Clam, Crispy Prawns with Rice Rolls and Egg Tarts! Those were the highlights of the meal together with the Peking Duck. Have fun foodies! I've attached some pictures for your references.
5
Visited this place for lunch. Served awesome dim sum. Must try their fried carrot cake, siew mai and fried yam cake. Good place for business or leisure with friends or family. Have been here several times and I would say the food and service here consistent
5
Even when the restaurant is busy the service level whilst under allot of pressure holds up well. I love the food here and imperial treasure at Paragon offers good value, the roast duck is excellent and when we have visitors in town I am always confident to take them here as it ticks all the boxes
4
Although quite pricey the food was delicious! We ordered the crab (which beware is priced per 100 g so confirm the price beforehand) with black pepper, which I was told because I didn't try it, was exceptional. The service was also very professional
3
I think I must have been at IT on the same Sunday night as awejames. We had a busy day shopping and arrived at the unfashionable time of 6pm, very unusual for us. The staff seemed a bit surprised at our early arrival and a little at a loss as to what to do. Despite being very quiet, service was slow. We commented to ourselves that the staff seemed very young and disinterested. That did change when a more senior and experienced manager arrived. We sougth the restuarant out and even with the aid of a map ity was hard to find. Ultimately our meal was quite good but after a slow star
5
Enjoyed the dining experience at MBS Imperial Treasure. The service was great, food was pretty good and very filling, especially the soup
4
We had a table of 8 and manager's recommendation was all good.it is usual noisy kind of chinese restaurant. if you need privacy, book a private room
5
Went on Sunday evening and restaurant was only 2 tables occupied at 6pm. Service upfront was lacklustre as they expected us to swop chair ourselves due to food crumbs uncleaned. However things got better as good came along. Had Peking duck which was scrumptious, beef slices with kailan tasted tender and sweet. Service was also noted prompt though restaurant was almost full by 7pm with tour groups and families. Complimentary dessert - mango sago - given at end of dinner which was added plus.
4
We were taken to this place by our Singaporean friends on our first night here. Food is competently executed & attractively presented. A worthy place if you fancied a change from the hawker food
4
I enjoyed eating at this restaurant. It is in a busy shopping area. The food was very good and service was very attentive
5
We had our lunch there and we love the food and the service provided! We ordered 5 types of dim sum, seafood, beef and pork dishes. All are delicious, the waiter really helped us to choose the highly recommended menus and really taking care of our needs. It is highly recommended! Will go back there for sure
5
Had lunch here and enjoyed a traditional Chinese New Year salad along with a whole lot of other treats. Many prawn dishes, all fabulous. Also traditional dim sum, carrot cake (not like US carrot cake), these fluffy pastry balls with something warm and tasty, and a couple desserts, including these delicious pure white lava cake cupcakes. These were delicious to top off a fabulous lunch. I will say this place is hard to find if you don't know where to go in marina bay. It is in the mall, but overlooking the casino without a storefront in the actual mall part. So hard to find, ask the restaurant desk how to get in.
5
Went here with family, because we were staying at the MBS, and OMG was it soo good. The custard Buns were fantastic, the staff were soo friendly, when we go back to Singapore we are definently going back
3
The food are served with decent presentation, and is nice presented. However the portion is a bit small
4
Nice food but the venue was not inspiring being in a windowless area above the casino in a shopping mall.
3
There was no duck! Not a good start!
Service was sort of ok. The food was sort of ok.
Nothing really to invite me back. So I won't.
4
This co own 5 or 6 similar restaurants. R
The best is at tgphe ion centre and they have a good one in the airport
4
Nice Chinese restaurant with tasty Chinese dishes. Service was good but dishes took time to serve. The restaurant allow clients to bring own wine so recommend to bring a nice bottle of your favourite wine to accompany the tasty dishes.

I recently visited Singapore just after New Years and just had to check out the Marina Bay Sands resort! There are over 60 restaurants in the whole hotel complex and so we were stuck for choice. We were set on eating Chinese so we asked someone in the hotel and they recommended this place.The food was very flavoursome and they were generous with the portions, even if you order ''small''. There are a lot of options but surprisingly hardly any duck dishes - which I really wanted. My girlfriend is vegetarian but they didn't seem to care too much, although they suggested a couple of dishes and she had no choice but to opt for them.Luckily her food came out nice and she was pleased. Their service isn't great - and I personally feel like just because we weren't screaming money - they didn't attend to us as quickly as some of the customers dining there. It wasn't a welcoming restaurant (in this instance) - not sure what it would be like on any other day.They hardly smiled, they didn't once come over to check on us or ask what we thought of the food. It was way too posh and serious. The atmosphere wasn't vibrant and fun. For that reason, I wouldn't go back. The price was reasonable for the type of restaurant it is, being in the Marina Bay Sands complex - along with all the high end stores
5
Its my first visit with my dad to this restaurant. Ambience was comfortable and great for any occasion especially family with elderlys.The food especially the Barbequeue Pork and Shrimp fried rice(Yang Chow fried rice) was delicious, my dad had two bowls(usually he dont eat so much because he has a small appetite) of that and the dimsum(rice roll with Barbequeue Pork and Fried Beancurd skin with Shrimp) we have ordered was nice. The staffs was always there to ensure tea were being refilled and the dishes was cleared after we finished the food. From the ambience to the food quality till the service, there was nothing to complain about.Until we got up and left the restaurant, the staff greeted us Thank You.Good service and great food, definitely will patronise this restaurant again
5
Very nice Tim sum unique to,this outlet, good Peking duck, service is excellent very consistent , been ther many time, food is still high standard
5
The best Imperial Treasure in Town, Excellent Food and Service but however a bit pricy. Overall still best dining experience
5
Had a chilli & black pepper mud crab & it was superb. Reasonably priced for the location above the casino. Service was prompt & Tiger beer was ice cold. Could not fault any of our dishes. Very well appointed chinese restaurant & we will be back! You only come here for the food & service as there are no views to be had
5
If you are stopping over in Changi you can opt to stay at the Crowne Plaza in which is this Chinese restaurant. Menu is pleasingly varied to the extent the squeamish westerners need to look past the Sharks Fin soups.... But the usual Cantonese favourites like sweet and sour, duck, Singapore noodles etc are all delicious. Seafood is a speciality. Service is fine, ambiance feels authentic despite the airport location and afterwards all you need to do is stagger back to your room for a good nights sleep.
5
Great food and great service.
We didn't have the Peking duck but did share a whole roast duck which was one of the best I have had in Singapore.
All our side dishes were also great.
Will definitely become regular customers.
5
Every single dish was delicious, especially the Peking Duck. The ambiance was great, the seat was comfortable. The staffs were presentable, each of the wait staff had their own role so they made sure you'll be served properly.
5
They have got many branches, most are very good. This one is no exception. They are famous for their sharks fin soup. Quite pricey, but quality is always there.
4
Sauce is personally prepared by the staff as per your liking, very impressive, must try to Tofu skin

My eldest sister treated extended family members to this restaurant for her birthday on Aug 12. It took us ages to find the restaurant as we parked at the shopping mall, whereas the restaurant is located in the lift besides the casino entrance. There was a warm welcome from the restaurant manager. The appetizer, the main course (the braised soup with fish maw), the vegetables dish, the Peking Duck, and the lobster noodles all tasted delicious. The lobster noodles was very sweet. There was also 2 desserts specially arranged for birthday occasions too, which was really special, as the desserts mean longevity and happily ever after. The only downside is that we thought the restaurant would provide us at least with a birthday cake, at least for the occasion; however, after one of our other guests double checked, was told that sorry, they do not do birthday cakes. Or else if we have known, I would have brought along the birthday cake I ordered the day before. The staff were presentable and friendly too. Only if the parking was not so complicated, we would have visited the restaurant more often
5
When you're at Marina Bay Sands craving Chinese food, head to this place. The restaurant entrance is through the casino so for those of you who haven't been to the casino this could be your bonus.Extensive menu with plenty options for the vegetarians this place offers food with good flavours. The service is good . Start with dim sums and feel free to ask for modifications if you have some restrictions , they are very accommodating. So good food that suits your taste
5
Went to the branch at Changi Airport T3, tucked away in the Crowne Plaza Hotel. The dimsum was excellent, fresh and tasty, exquisitely prepared and served promptly. We had the fried carrot cake, lotus leaf glutinous rice, rice rolls, duck noodles and a soup with dried scallops. The neighbouring table had a roast duck which looked terrific, made into Peking duck buns, I think. There was a sizeable Sunday crowd but the intelligent and hardworking staff managed to seat everyone who came in, even without a reservation and poured water and tea whenever necessary. You must ask for the menu with the prices though as some tables may only have the general menu without accompanying prices
5
I am a regular customer of this restaurant especially the marina bay sands outlet. My favorite dishes is Peking duck, deep fried soon hock fish, dim sum, fried rice and many more. They have quite few private rooms too. The service is good and the ambience is cosy.
5
Probably one of the best peking ducks in Singapore. I have to go there to get my usual fix at least once a fortnight!The steamed scallops with vermicelli and steamed oyster with black bean are two more very good reasons to go.Not everything is amazing though. The baked squid with salted egg was a poorly executed and thought out dish.Decor is beautiful and luxuriousGreat place for a special weekly mea
4
I've eaten here twice. The peking duck is great. generally, it is the best Imperial Treasure branch I've been to. The service is nondescript but efficient enough. It is quite pricey though. 5 courses which includes Peking duck was 50$ a head. Of course, you can get similar quality food for cheaper elsewhere but if you are in Marina Bay area and you are looking for a good Chinese restaurant, this is a safe bet
5
A bit more expensive for Singapore, but you'll struggle to get food this good in England for twice the price.
We're going back tomorrow...
5
Had lunch with friends and my the food is not only mouth watering it's absolutely beautiful to the eyes and satisfying to the stomach.... The owner even stopped by the table.... These are the places I enjoy when you see friendly hands own gracious people...
5
The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor (third floor) of the Marina Bay Shoppes, you can only access it through lift, there is no escalator going up (Paiza Area).We had dinner here last night due to a recommendation from a friend, our friend said that this restaurant is to die for, if you are looking for very fine quality chinese food. I have to clarify that this restaurant is not your average chinese restaurant, the prices for the menu are quite high, for various reasons such as being in a casino resort, serving all kind of exquisite chinese cuisine with exotic ingredient.The restaurant is famous for its Pecking Duck (Beijing Style), Shark Fin and Live Sea Food. Once you are seated (Reservation is highly recommended) the menu does not have photos or pictures. The menu itself can be overwhelming, for example the Shark Fin list in itself goes about 2.5 Pages. Me and my wife had these for dinner;1. Century Egg + Ginger2. Roasted Duck3. Bamboo Clam Garlic + Vermicelli 4. Imperial Shark Fin in thick Chicken Broth5. Srilankan Crab cooked in Ginger and Shallot + Egg Noodle6. Mix Vegetable ClaypotI have attached some photos for your reference.Overall we are very satisfied and very happy with everything in this restaurant. Service was excellent, food were delicious, truly all the menu that we choose were cooked and serve to a very high standard.Prepare to pay premium price for premium food. Do try if you are bored of the average chinese food
4
Our group had dinner at the Marina Bay Sands branch of Imperial Treasure. On the overall I would rate the food as very good, prepared in classic and refined Cantonese style (except for the Singapore chili crab, which was also good).Peking Duck was also on the menu and it was done well, though not the best that I've had. Same with the roast pork ("siew yoke").Atmosphere and interior decor was posh and service was good. It is pricey though
5
Imperial Treasure Fine Chinese is Located in Marina Bay Sands on Bayfront Avenue, it offer great selection of Chinese dishes in combos with great value and taste. They have a wide range of set menus for group who wish to dine conveniently. The restaurant occupies a large floor space; consisting of several function rooms suitable for business/family gatherings. The cuisine is extravagant and intricate in tastes and textures, Special mention the Peking duck. It was the best taste outside Peking it was expertly sliced with great proficiency; we have dined in the other entire chain restaurant and found that this one is the supreme in all its glory. Let mention the bill, yes it was overpriced but itâ€™s accepted for its location and outstanding service
4
We came on the last day of Chinese Luna New Year celebrations on 5th March 2015. We went with our hosts and had a very enjoyable meal. The meal started with a food mixing ceremony where all 10 of us mixed the various ingredients using Chopsticks to throw into the air before sharing the result with those at the table - great cultural experience.Overall a very enjoyable meal, we had a variety of dishes served up, including Sea Urchin, which was a first for me. Great setting with very luxurious interior

End Of Year Celebration close with excellent food! starting with steam abalone that had been prepared 6 hours before. Its very tender in your mouth. If you like the chilli xo, its the best ever. I couldn't stop eating this chilli and we bought 3 bottles the bring it home. If you pork lover, the deep pork with salt and pepper also very good. Soup hot and sour also another excellent food as a starte

The view of the Casino greets you as you enter the restaurant area where Imperial Treasure is situated. The restaurant looks like most chain restaurants do and food also is quite standardized. Dim sums and soups were quite delicious. we tried the custard buns for dessert and liked it.I'm a big fan of Jasmine tea and recommend you have it with your meal. Service was good

This is 2nd time visit this restaurant this year..Both visit we always order set meal that we feel quite worth..Menu comprises Chicken soup (the chicken broth is quite thick)Saute Prawn with asparagus (one of my favorite) the prawn and asparagus taste very nice Deep fried cod fish (actually it suppose to bee deep fried eel but since we don't like it they change to deep fried codfish with salt and pepper. it crispy outside juicy inside. very niceBraised sea cucumber with minced pork.

Imperial treasure we understand it is a chain but it is able to deliver good food. We ordered dim sum and Peking duck. It was professionally sliced with great skills. The pancake and sauce were great.
4
Having dinner with my family at this location a few time and the food and standard is always the same high standard and excellent services. The Peking duck is a signature dish, which we always order on every visit. Worth going back
5
Ordered some dim sum for lunch and they were all freshly prepared on the spot, so waiting time could take awhile. The egg tarts are mini in size and they are to die for; the best egg tarts I've had so far in town!

Highly recommend this restaurant. Nice décor, great service and delicious cuisine. Be sure to visit this one if you love great Chinese food!

This restaurant took a while to find but it was definitely worth it. Although there is a lack of natural light the restaurant is attractively decorated. For my starter I ordered one deep fried oyster and one oyster braised with ginger and spring onions. Both of these were sensational. My mains consisted of a 1/2 portion of chili prawns 'Singapore' style, a small portion of sweet & sour pork and a 1/2 portion of vegetable fried rice. The chili sauce for the prawns was too sweet for my taste but I understand this is 'Singapore' style. The sweet & sour pork was the best I have ever eaten and the rice was perfectly light and fluffy. My only real criticism is the order the food came in - prawns served first and by the time I had eaten these then the rice arrived followed by one of the oysters. Felt a little like a tapas style service. Next time (and I certainly hope to visit again as the food was delicious) I will be more explicit on courses

I continue to be drawn to Imperial Treasure in Singapore at their locations in Paragon, Takashimaya and Marina Bay Sands for one reason and one reason only. Their food is simply divine. Superb infact. Other contributors have said enough in much more detail. Sufficeth to say, you cannot go wrong. One word of caution though........service levels may be on the way down but then again I must have gone on a busy Saturday night into a packed restaurant
5
This has got to be one of the best Chinese restaurants in Singapore.It's located in Marina Bay Sands (MBS), so it's super easy to find. The decor is tasteful, elegant modern Chinese. The seating arrangement is very comfortable and doesn't make you feel crammed as in many other chinese restaurants.We came here for the dim sum. The food was well prepared and tasted wonderful. I especially love the Liu Sha Bao (salted egg yolk custard bun or golden custard bun). It's to die for. The tea is wonderful too.The service was excellent! Prompt, polite and professional.I will definitely comeback here

I really enjoy a great dining experience but when one has a cold and cannot taste the food properly it can be a setback. But I enjoyed what I could taste and that was the pork, fish, prawns, soup and beans with minced pork. Overall the experience was great, the service standards were typical of a chinese restaurant - simple and uncomplicated and the atmosphere was pleasing. The location above the gaming tables was different and lucky we had a reservation for Friday night dinner
5
I've been to the branches in paragon and great world city and truly love their food. Happened to be in MBS so why not. Stepped in on a Sunday night without reservations and glad there was a table for usOrdered the soup of the day which was a delightful and healthy papaya boiled soup. Of course, had their famous roast pork and it didn't disappoint as expected. Had an overseas friend who wanted to try the famous Singapore chilli crab and kazam they have it on their menu. We tasted it and I must say it's 1 of the best in Singapore, compared to many local seafood restaurants. Who would have thought! Ended with the always reliable noodles with truffle oil, delightfulThroughout the meal, the service by the matronly and friendly ladies were excellent and the captains were super cheerful tooI'm aghast by the bad reviews here about dishes arriving together (this is Chinese food, dude) or fish coming with bones (this is Chinese food, miss), so it's best one comes with the right experience and an open min

Great food but we ordered the set meal for two. Lots of things we liked. Dumplings, hot and sour soup, bok choy, fried rice, Peking duck. The only problem was it all came at once and it was something of a battle to get through it all before it got cold. It seemed a little bit like they were on a mission to get the table turned around quickl

What I Liked:
Traditional Chinese food served, with attentive service.
What I Disliked:
20 minutes wait for my bill to be delivered, TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!
LONG WAITING TIME BETWEEN DISHES, TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL!
Yes or No? Absolutely no, No, NO !!!
3
The food very ordinary, prices asked high. place is small, noisy and crowded. Would not recommend this restaurant of you are looking for a good HK food

I was told about the great Chinese food at the Imperial Treasure chain, and as I happened to be at Marina Bay Sands, went into this one. The food was OK but service was awful - quite rude! A glass of white wine was SGD 40 before taxes and service, without any warning for the scandalous price! My friends told me later I was at the wrong Imperial Treasure - they meant the ones at Takashimaya or Paragon, where both the food and service are much better. I also don't understand why a mundane Chinese canteen like this one is allowed to be on the same floor as the 'Celebrity' restaurants Waku Ghin and Guy Savoy

Racist, Rude and a total rip off!we decided to book a table at the imperial as we had a great experience back in 2011. upon arriving i had noticed that the main dining room had a lot of empty tables as it was around 9pm, we arrived on time and were told by the receptionist that our table was not ready.... weird as i noticed a lot of tables free. anyhow a few minutes later we were asked to follow a member of staff to our (table). all of a sudden we were weaving in and out of corridors , past staff and countless doors , well away from the main dining area. We finally were asked to enter a small room with a table and 4 chairs in a cut off private room with windows overlooking the marina bay Shoppes. this was very strange and felt like we were being hidden away from all the other dinners who were in the main area. Our menus arrived , well actually were slammed on the table by our ( i will refer to her as our 'Waitress') who never spoke a single word . I advised her that we needed to have all our meals Gluten Free and presented a Gluten free info card printed in Malaysian and chinese. She then mumbled something and disappeared . after awhile the head waiter arrived and discussed that the restaurant would have a very difficult time making our meals gluten free and everything would be 'Tasteless' . we explained that Gluten free doesn't mean Taste free and in the end ordered a simple soup and a steamed fish with some ginger and spring onion. the food started to arrive with no words or discussion from our 'waitress' and when the fish arrived it was basically put in front of us , whole and no offer of de boning and the Ginger and spring onion were RAW! it was basically inedible . it had no flavour , no seasoning NOTHING! the ginger and spring onion were just left on top uncooked . at this stage we felt like we were hidden away and the service we received would have been better if we had committed a crime and were placed in a Singapore jail!!!what made it worse this meal cost us over 400 Singapore dollars.Basically this establishment prefers asian clients and does not understand basic food allergies and refuses to work around themstay away , there is far better places to eat in the great city of Singapore

This establishment appears to have gained quite a following among some people. I would agree that it has nothing on the Imperial Treasure in Hong Kong. After coming for lunch and deciding on a yum cha only menu, there were a good good surprises that were made fresh but there was also a lot of pre prepared stuff which was mediocre and can be found anywhere. If you come here for lunch try the mushroom dim sum (as pictured) they are fantastic. The custard tarts are also made to a high standard with perfect pastry and very good filling
3
Very disappointed as I went there looking trip advisor recommendation.Arrived at 20:30 and they sold out the Peking duck!Food is ok but not the finest for a Chinese restaurant, prawns we had were in lots of sauce very gluey.Very noisy and busy, not very comfortable seats.But if you looking for some good wines, this the the place.Staffs were ok. Try somewhere else unless you are doing you shopping and desperate to ea

I don't understand why some people rated this restaurant 5 stars. Ok, fair enough that their Roast Pork is nice, but the rest of the menu are just average including their Peking Duck. NOTHING SPECIAL. Service is slow. We were seated in a private room. There was a long pause between dishes, is not really nice when you have to stop eating and wait for the next dish to come out. Your rice get cold. Asking for tea, it takes forever. The concept of fine dining is NOT there at all. Plates were never changed. During the whole meal, tea was never topped up. Waitress out of sight. If you are a person that really enjoy food, STAY AWAY from this place. The only good thing is when they presented the bill, you could get a nice designer handbag!

If you are looking for a really really good and satisfying Chinese meal, I can think of no better restaurant and venue than the Imperial Treasure at Marina Bay Sands. We went there for a Saturday lunch and ordered their Dim Sum including a mushroom varietal that was simply out of this world. That was followed by Tofu, noodles, rice and an assortment of expressions of culinary delights from the middle kingdom that reminded me once again why Imperial Treasure stands out as a true constant of perfection amidst a sea of venues, not only in Marina Bay or that matter in Singapore.I just feel so disappointed that despite is vast population of Chinese people i need to fly 26 hours from my residence in Toronto Canada to come and get some good quality Chinese food and wonder why it is that the city I call home accepts mediocrity and the one I used to call home settles for no other than perfection

We were invited by some friends at this lovely restaurant. Apart from being in one of the best shopping centers in Singapore this restaurant had a lovely menu. The 6 course meal we had was filling, exquisite and supreme. We felt like royalty there. The Peking duck was served as an appetizer followed by shark fin soup, fish, steamed rice, vegetables and an amazing Dorian desert. A must to any traveler
5
Went there with family and friends. We dined in a private room. Service staff were very friendly with us. Nothing seemed too much for them. We ordered peking duck, salted fish minced pork, stewed beancurd, spinach with 3 kinds of egg, fried rice and a duck soup.
3
It's a average restaurant and service level.I regret that I took my client for dinner. The poor service destroyed for the important dinner. Should have gone to Lei Garden instead.
5
good food and attentive service provided . price reasonable and comfortable settings and not at all noisy
5
We lunched at the restaurant at ION centre on Orchard Road. I'm usually not a fan of Chinese food, but my wife is. That said, I really enjoyed my meal and so did my wife. Authentic Chinese cuisine, well-presented and served promptly. Recommended.

Imperial deco for imperial treasure restaurant but also the billwe went there for a business dinner and we got a very good service provided by very charming peopleit s a chinese menu ; you can order beef , fish or ... many things the deco is luxe and you must make resevation before goingthis restaurant is in the 2nd floor in the marina bay shoppes center and just above the casine but have it s own entrance with other restaurants on the same floorseems all are luxious but i diid had the chance to try other
3
We had dim sum for lunch. But I've had better dim sum than this, so I didn't think it was really fantastic. Because it was located in Marina Bay Sands, we were expecting a very expensive meal and in return expecting better quality food, but the total bill turned out to be fairly reasonable
5
Took the family of 4 adults and 4 kids for a Dim Sum lunch. I don't have a list of everything we had but it was just fabulous. We are big Dim Sum eaters and have always loved the Crystal Jade Palace at Ngee Ann and also have had a good one at Cherry Garden, so I have some good comparisons, plus we have just had 8 days in Hong Kong and ate at Lung King Heen amongst other places.It's not too high end that we felt uncomfortable as we were neatly dressed but not in our Sunday best as we were out touristing! The service was great, have the Peking Duck but make sure they bring the rest of the duck back to your table as ours disappeared after the first course was served and we had to ask them to bring the rest back. Tofu dishes great and a rice egg prawn roll was superb. I think most things on the menu would be good.We will be eating again there next April 2014 when we return and can't wait, organising the trip around it as we are only in Singapore for a short time.Lozzie6

Book for lunch, service level was poor, ask for a glass of warm water for few times before it gets served. Ask for bill takes a long time too. Pricey menu, food was edible but over rated really. Ordered Peking duck, steam garoua, fish maw black chicken soup, noodles, dim sum. I am not likely to return this outlet of imperial treasure.

Located in the magnificent Marina Bay Sands, the restaurant is beautifully appointed and the food was similarly excellent. No complaints. The service was somewhat odd. At no point did any of the staff actually make eye contact with me. If I asked for something, the staff member would mutter some words into a headset and then just walk away. Another person would deliver it and then walk away. I must have been served by about 10 diferent people. While this might seem like a trivial complaint, the atmosphere it created was more like an efficient assembly line rather than a warm dining experience
1
I visited the Marina Bay Sands restaurant on Sunday 24 Feb with my family, and the one at the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport on Monday 25 Feb with business associates.On both occasions, the waitresses would steer us towards the most expensive dishes without disclosing prices. When we requested the dimsum menu, the waitress would lose interest and walk off. When we tried the food the waitress recommended we found it to be very poor value for money relative to other dishes on the menu, with the *sole* exception of the Peking duck, which was expensive but quite excellent. The service was also very poor (the receptionist at Marina Bay Sands was quite rude, and on both occasions I had to wait a very long time for the bill and even longer for my receipt.)Tragically, I was a long-term supporter of this chain since it's very early days in Singapore, and still think they serve reasonably good food. Given the choice available these days however, it's just not worth the annoyance. I would personally never visit again, and would caution all customers *not* to be dependent on their staff for recommendations. Diner beware

I had dinner with my family today. We order roast combination, stir fried kailan, peking duck, crab soup and fried beef slices with mushroom. The food was great. I would definitely come again.Service average. Many other food selection. This restaurant do serve delicious dim sum during lunch time.... recommended for sure. If you visit Marina Bay Sands. Must at least dine once. Great ambience and seating. Private room also available. Reservation on weekend is a must
5
Loved loved the food there....tried almost all the imperial chain in Singapore but thought the food tasted best there so we pretty much went there for all our dinners :)

Imperial Treasure Fine Chinese Cuisine is one of the restaurant placed on the special floor on the Casino side building. From this floor you can see most of the casino floor layout. The restaurant itself serves most Chinese delicacies including Beijing Duck, etc.
3
Yes the peking duck is good but this is yet another chinese restaurant that didnt really stand out. The food is good but not amazing while decor is nice and the service is good.
5
I was invited to a birthday dinner at MBS and this was the only saving grace of the hotel. The food was excellent and the staff was very helpful. They knew their roles and treated the customers with warmth and courtesy.
4
Nicely located this restaurant serves great food at acceptable prices. Good value for money. Service could be better though.
3
The portion where ok but the quality of food not so great
5
The food in general are good value but beware of their waiters recommendation as they usually will recommend very expensive items... check the prices on the menu and politely refuse recommendation from them.
3
We are big fans of the Imperial Treasure chain, but have issues with this one. While a few dishes are special, most are just normal (the Peking duck is even less good than at Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck) but much more pricey. You pay for the decor, as the service is no better than at other Imperial Treasure eateries, and certainly less personal than at its neighbours on the celebrity chef floor of MBS, eg. Waku Ghin or Guy Savoy
4
A little difficult to find at first but a floor above the casino floor of the Marina Bay Sands sits this excellent restaurant. Classic upmarket Chinese interior and generous seating, cozy booths are available. The service is good and staff is in abundance. A favorite is the Peking Duck, this is very good indeed. Ask the kitchen to prepare noodles with the meat. The Dim Sum menu is very varied and will have something for every taste. Try the custard buns
4
Went there twice... 1st was on our wedding anniversary.. Liked the food, so brought my family on my mum's birthday few months later... Had jellyfish for starters, peking duck on those 2 occasions..... Both hubby and i are small eaters, so we are grateful for the small servings......
5
I went with my mom and wife on occasion for my mom's birthday. Truly a best cantonese culinary experiences and most exclusive service in town. Will return for more delicious cuisines in future
5
They have many shops in Singapore. Most off them can exceed your expectation. Good Cantonese and Peking duck.
5
While on vacation in Singapore last week, we had a perfect dim sum lunch there recently in a VIP room. All dim sum dishes were very yummy, special mentions: wonderfully light-crusted egg tarts and char siew sou (mini bbq port pies). We had to doggy bag the latter as we couldn't finish everything orders and had these wonderful little things as breakfast the next day. yummmmmmmy. The Peking duck was nicely crisp, served in a delicious steamed wrapper. Try the "quick sand" bao for dessert: it has a runny filling made of custard and salty preserved egg yolks, giving it a unique sweet-salty flavor. The staff was very well trained and friendly
5
I had the pleasure to have dinner here as part of hosting foreign speakers during our conference. We had a private dining room booked. Service was excellent. Every dish from our 8 course set dinner was impeccable. I highly recommend this for travellers who want to sample the finest chinese cuisine
2
We had booked here for Christmas night, 7 in our group. When we got there they had put us into a private room (and said they had no other tables, we had booked a week earlier) which was not ideal as you have no atmosphere at all, very ordinary decor. Waiter was not very useful or helpful with the ordering and with the size of the menu help was needed. 3 of the items we ordered they came back to say they did not have necessitating changes, that in a rush and with no useful guidance we ordered badly. None of the dishes were particularity tasty and one was disgsuting! Bitterly regretted we hadn't gone back to the Cherry Garden for a second night. Good view of the Casino though
5
We first tried this restaurant in April and returned twice on this visit. The food was even better than we remembered and the service was impeccable. We tried the duck, chicken, beancurd, fish and vege dishes and they were all great. My favourite was the sweet and sour beancurd. My partner really liked the crispy skin chicken
4
We visited this restaurant because while staying at the Marina Bay Sands and because there was no availability at the KU DE TA restaurant. It turned out to be one of the best restaurants we`ve been in Singapore! Since the menu is HUGE, we ended up ordering a set menu for 98S$ per person plus a bottle of wine. It was a bit pricy but all of it and especially the duck, was simply delicious! Plus its just above the casino, so this could be your lucky restaurant:
4
The food: Well prepared. I am not an expert at cantonese food, but ingredients and preparation seemed good. Try the beef with fried garlic.Atmosphere/interior: We went for late lunch, and the place was very quiet so it was hard to get a good feel. As with everything at The Shoppes at Marina Bay, it has an upscale feeling to it.Service: Good, but English skills were on the week side for being Singapore. That might be a good sign of actual chinese-chinese working there :
5
There is no shortage of good Chinese restaurants in Singapore, but this is one of the best. Excellent quality and the portions are small, which means you can sample a wide variety of dishes without feeling you have ordered more than you can eat.Service was quick, efficient and pleasant. Food tasted fresh, rather than "re-cooked" as sometimes happens in lesser Chinese places. Our orders had just the right balance of exotic spices and flavors.Highly recommended

Visited this restaurant on Valentine's day as Hide Yamamoto nearby was fully booked. Anyway, the food is what i have expected from the restaurant chain, good quality and tasty in my opinion. Service wise is pretty good as well as the lady kept checking with us if everything was fine. The shark fin soup is thick and flavourful. Like the roast pork as well as the skin was extremely crispy, though i found the portion too small for my liking. The vege with abalone was another well done dish as the gravy was very very tasty and the abalone was cooked to perfection, not too hard. The Scallops with Foie gras was another fantastic dish. Interestingly, they goes well with each other, one of the fusion dish i guess, foie gras, a french delicacy cooked with scallops. The noodles are average though. Not forgetting the beef cheeks which has a rich and flavourful taste. Overall, a nice and pleasant dining experience.The restaurant is located within the MBS and before reaching the restaurant, u will actually walk pass the casino floor. The ambience is that of a standard high end chinese restaurant
