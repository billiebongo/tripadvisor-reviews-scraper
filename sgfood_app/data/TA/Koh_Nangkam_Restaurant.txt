Really good Thai food. Have only ever been for lunch and never encountered delays or service issues, just delicious food at a great price. It's on my to-do list every time I'm in Singapore.

Authentic Thai food but a lot of msg. Went there as it's halal. It's tasty but I'm very thirsty after that.

1 of my fave places to eat! I love the tomyum soup and the thai ice tea. It's soooo yummy! Also the thai style steamed fish, it's 1 of the best i've tasted so far. Do try it when you're there! They have a package deal, minimum 4 pax. It'll be cheaper compared to ala carte. Worth the money!

Well, was here in March actually and forgot to do a review on this restaurant. Came here for an ex-colleague farewell dinner. The place is quite small and a little squeeze-y but it does make it up with the food. Love their Thai Iced Tea Slushie and Mango Sticky Rice. As for the other food, it is good but could be better since it still is lacking of the original thai taste. Overall, it is still good since we enjoyed the food and ate till our hearts content

The place to go if you're looking for halal thai food. You can really taste the spices in the food and it's really worth it as the portion is more than average to me. The food does take some time to be served but they have warnings on the tables to explain that this is because each dish is freshly prepared.

My first impression of the place was dinghy and there was even a slightly very faint musty smell to it. The place was dimly lit too. The place was quite packed with lunch crowd. I chose 3 items for lunch Ratna (Thai Hor Fun), Tom Yam Soup and a warm calamansi drink (sugarless). They were superb! Seafood portion were generous in both of the dishes. Tasted authentic as the chef is from Thailand (I enquired at the Cashier). The squids tasted very fresh. Pricewise was very good. Only $16 for the 3 items. Will come again to try the dishes, nevermind the smell and the dimness of the place....

Great food, quick service, all the food came hot. Unlike previous reviews, we told the waiter the strength of the dish and asked for more chilli as well as less oil. The green iced tea was lovely and the sweetness complimented the heat of the green curry, which was lovely. Enjoyed the fried rice with pineapple.

Brought my boss there with colleague for a Farewell Lunch.I was extremely worried as I had read the three reviews prior to setting off for the restaurant. Did not want to have a disastrous lunch.We walked from bright sunshine into a dim restaurant. You could imagine it looked VERY dim but after a while, our eyes adjusted and we could see just as well. The tables and chairs were a little tad close if there were a lot of people dining. However, as it was lunch time and a reasonable number of patrons, it was not an issue.The fried fish and chicken became instant favourites. The clear Tom Yum tasted a bit salty. Mango salad whetted the appetite. Not impressed with Kailan in Oyster sauce.We had two plates of rice (for 3 pax), fried fish, fried chicken, mango salad, tom yum soup, kalian, 3 lime juice (not too sweet. Just nice and cold) and 1 coconut water (bottled). The bill came up to $70. Overall, the experience was on the higher end of average.We are pleased with what we had and will definitely be returning
