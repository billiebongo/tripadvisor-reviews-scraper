Organised a gathering with friends at Asian Market Cafe. Food was great, especially the Nonya corner and deserts. Loved the durian paste. Place was neat and clean. Service was prompt. Good experience overall!
1
Came here on a Eatigo deal, too little variety, too much seafood. Really overpriced, 80 dollars for 1 person, with such a limited offering. U should avoid and eat outside the hotel...
4
Foods are delicious. Staff are very courteous and attentive. Variety of foods is good. Only problem is air cond is not cold may be due to large crowd.
3
1) Waiting for the prata was toooo LONG! take like 10mins to Q for prata! do add extra manpower.
2) Chili crab & satay took forever to top-up. Compare to straits kitchen is so much better.
4
We went for dinner & it was buffet style.There was a wide variety of Asian food and was spoilt for choice.Some of the dishes were very tasty and reasonably priced
2
Disappointing choice of food. Popular dishes like oysters, satay, crabs were gone the moment they were served. Replenishment was slow, perhaps to control cost by the restaurant management. Will not return for second visit.
2
The food choices are poor as the laksa, roti jalal are gone. The freshly made prata has a long queue n only ONE chef to do everything. I pity him. The griddle can only burn so hot.

This restaurant is part of the Fairmont/Swissotel hotel complex and is very popular so make sure you book a table.It's a simple concept, a massive buffet featuring fresh seafood, sushi, Asian specialities, salads, desserts, and more.A lovely way to sample lots of different dishes without the worry of ordering something you don't like
3
Overall the food varieties served at Asian Market Cafe is limited. One bad point if you dine after 8:30pm is they hardly replenish the food, the food are left over from the 6:30pm time slot diners. It is better to dine at 6:30pm time slot. The price difference is just $10.
4
Extremely wide choice and a good spread of options, ranging from Japanese, to Vietnamese, North Indian, Chinese, Thai and Malay with seafood and European too. Weâ€™ll stocked in all buffet options, but only downside is that it suffers from what many buffets tend to, in that it is the jack of all trades, but the master of none. Everything was ok, but nothing was great? Service though was really good and staff were attentive. Good for a large party business function with wide choice of multiple cultural options being its strong point
5
One of the finest halah certified restaurant with a good buffet spread of local delights and excellent service to go with!
3
Cold section - salad was a little disappointing.
Dessert section - could have more cakes variety.
Soup - was not hot.
3
This is a great price for a buffet if your staying in the Fairmont, 50% discount. However it wasn't for me. The food that I had was good, but not to my taste. But lots of people and good atmosphere!
5
Variety of asian food was good. Service was good. Mentioned that it was my anniversary and they presented us a slice of cake.
4
Seafood is fresh eapecially the prawns and the scallop. Good variety of local cusine like kueh pie tee and laksa. However, the highlight s still the durian pudding which got wiped out immediately after a refill
4
Acceptable spread, tasty food. Cafe was very noisy when a big group of event visitors arrived but service was still good despite the crowd. Will visit again.
4
The location is pretty accessible- MRT and carparks are situated in the same area, however it is in CBD, so if you are unfamiliar with the roads do prepare yourself beforehand. Located at level 2, there's even a prayer room both for men and women- a definite thumbs up for muslims. The food is delicious and the choices do vary from japanese cuisine to thai to malay and anything asia however it is limited nonetheless. Considering the price with choices at hand, it does seem a little overpriced.The service is great and attentive- i always came back to a clean table and that truly is impressive. Had a great dinner and loved the crabs

This will be my 1st Time and Last time. 19 Pax went down for the Dinner Buffet.We were the 1st to enter and start the buffet session. Halfway thro the food session- we realised the Crabs were not fresh. The Chef even confirmed that. Manager on duty served us 'Fresh Crabs'. By then- damage was done. Half of us experience Food Poisoning symptoms. If im the only one affected- I wouldnt be writing these feedback. Disappointing experience and bad memory
2
19 pax of frens..some ate chilli crabs and some didnt.Informed Manager on duty of some crabs eaten are not freshConfirm By CHEF that it is not fresh. We were served a different set of chilli crabs.The effect was some of my frens had diarheo & vomitting inclu myselfIm not gonna gain any credits by complaining but sad how this issue was handle..Bad memory on my part as customer.Thank you.
3
Has variety, quality of food average for the price... but if it’s not for the one for one... seriously not worth it... food refills are slow and queues are long, cause of refills... water on tables are not refilled... I’m sorry, but I feel that others should know before coming... Service staff good in general but our cutleries got removed by service staff whilst we were still sitting at the table... Dad was chatting but not done with his cakes...Staff came and gestured at my dad for his cutleries and pointed at his cutleries saying “sir”... whilst pointing... Dad was clueless... but why? Are we done?
5
Great place to chill up and meet up with family and friends. Food variety was good. Service staff were attentive and polite. Pricing is reasonable. Yes I will recommend family and friends to patronise this restaurant
3
One main problem is the menu never change ... variety are limited ... dessert is super sweeet ... cakes are super limited (2 or 3 choices only) ... but their osyter are fresh n juicy
4
The food and spread was good for the price we paid. OCBC 50% off but if it was the full price then it won't be worth it.
5
Meets expectation, from the food to value to atmosphere. Their service staff were great. Good place with great company.
5
1st time to Asian Market Cafe. Relax and good view to watch some F1 racing. Menu attractive, quite quiet, clearing of plates is fast. Waiter & waitress are very polite. Will suggest this cafe a good gathering place for family and friends.
5
Has all the food i liked. I'm a oyster lover. Oysters mostly fresh but ate 2 that was not fresh. But other than that everything was good, will definitely be back.
3
Decor was dated,oysters were not fresh,beef was overcooked.price per head was $70plus as i think they mark it up as there was a 1 for 1 promo. wouldn't pay dat price for lical food and the service. Staff saw me coming to cashier but walked away to do something else
4
There's 50% off when you pay with ocbc cards! After discount, it's pretty worth it! Good service as plates are cleared very fast. I ordered from the chef whole caring carrying my baby. He requested the waitress to assist me to bring the food back. It was a very sweet and thoughtful gesture. Love the service
2
Came with a group of 15 friends. Buffet spread was limited and food quality was indeed not 5 star standard - food cold, poor taste and limited fresh oysters served and the replenishing very slow .The restaurant is run down , old looking plates and the whole place need refurbishment . Definitely will not recommend
4
Restaurant is easily accessible, 5 minutes from Cityhall MRT. Reasonable spread of food varieties including fresh oysters (dinner only), prawns and chili crabs. Prices are not cheap though but do check out the credit promotions which offer great discounts at times. A worthwhile dining experience for my family.
4
Food quality is pretty consistent with different variety. Buffet comes with 3 basic juices which is nice.
5
the food fresh and the staff helpful. salmon salad really nice, the black papper crab, the chicken, and the curry chicken really really gd.
2
Visited here on 13th august 2017
1) food varieties is pathetic
2) seafood varieties is too limited
3) cooked food is very average
4) not paying $70+ for laksa / Prata etc
5
Great variety of food. Attentive staff. Great place to take visitors from overseas to enjoy a taste of local cuisine
4
Good Qualtiy food. warm services. Great! will definitely come back for more. great atmosphere and staff always ready to serve.
4
The buffet spread is pretty good and with a wide variety of Asian cuisine available. The decor is a bit dated but service was good. Plates get cleared very efficiently.
3
Went on a thursday evening with colleagues. The place was full, fortunately we had reserved tables.The variety was ok, there were Asian fare, and seafood, sashimi, sushi, dessert, etc.However, the bad thing is that the food was not topped up fast enough. Especially the popular items such as seafood, oysters, mussels.My group all had the same complaint- where are the oysters? The plate was always empty each time we passed by, on the rare occasion that we saw it being topped up, it was snapped up in seconds, BECAUSE the staff only topped up a grand total of FOUR oysters. He took them from a bucket where there were still a lot and kept it back after topping up a pathetic 4 oysters. That is the most ridiculous thing we ever saw. Maybe the ice area was too small , But the least they could do is to topup more often.This buffet costs 70++ per head, we expected a better experience for that price
4
Restaurant location is prime, easy to find, City Hall MRT but the setting was a bit cramped as business was good. A good place to tried some of the best Asia food, black peeper crab/laksa/roti Prata etc and not to mention durian pudding. As a local I find the price a bit too expensive, but we got a deal of 50% so thumb up
2
It has been long time since I last visited this restaurant. It used to be one of my favorite place for friends gathering. We decided to visit again today as we miss the food here. However, it was a great disappointment. Oyster station is always empty, so is the popiah station. When we finally get to grab the popiah, the quality was so bad. The durian pudding used to be one of my favorite, and I have always recommended my friends for the durian pudding here. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. There is a teh Tarik station, but always no one there. Hope to see improvement
3
I have been to this restaurant many times over the years but the recent visit was a disappointment.I made a reservation for 7 people for dinner. The service of the staff was impressive. Very attentive and quick to clear the table.However, the food was a disappointment. this time round, it was Asian buffet but there was not much to eat, as compared to my previous trips. Even my guests who have been to the restaurant, commented that there was less mains.Some of the mains such as the steamed fishes slices and the roast beef were disappointing. Even the chilli crabs, my guests commented that the taste was less than desired.Previously they would have someone to prepare roti prata and customs would excitedly queue up to place their orders. This time, already cooked some plain roti prata and left there for customers to take. It did not look appetizing......Dinner was S$70++. Definitely not worth the money!The resturant has great ambience and service was great..but the quality of the food was below expectation.The restaurant can do better! I really hope they look into it, seriously
4
Celebrated my wife's birthday & mother's day here. The restaurant is centrally located above an MRT station. Our daughters joined us easily after work. We enjoyed the buffet dinner and wine with credit card promo.
5
Staff were attentive and very polite. There is a wide variety of food. The ambience is good and cosy.
4
The service was very good, staffs were very polite too. However, the variety of food is very limited. Their butter chicken and mango cake are my favourite.
4
My family of four went to Asian Market Cafe this afternoon for lunch. We waited for 5 mins at the counter despite making a reservation. I was amazed how delicious the food were. I gave the salmon sashimi a miss as it was not suitable for my stomach. I especially loved some of the food there: Laska and prata, and the teh tarik. They had an unique taste and it was the best food i had ever eaten. The black pepper crab was also quite delicious. And of course there were still many delicious food. For the dessert flow, there were quite a variety of cakes, but i think that there should have a strawberry cake as i think not only me would like it, other customers will also like it especially the kids. The durian pudding i found it average. And yes, the chendol/Ice kachang creation was good. The ice cream scoop was very hard to release the vanilla ice cream. The mango ice cream's scoop was a little too small, and for me i think the mango ice cream was a bit sour. As ice cream has always been my cup of tea for years, i think i did not enjoy the ice cream at the cafe today, and there should be at least 4 toppings instead of two. And the two toppings was going to finish. Therefore, i did not enjoy the ice cream but i did enjoyed the cakes.(mango and green tea)So far the food i liked the most was the prata and laksa(the laksa gravy went smoothly well with the noodles and ingredients.) Therfore, i think that customers would indulge here. The ambience was lovely and pretty. Location: Swisstotel the Stamford (Raffles City)

Organized a meet up with friends over buffet dinner at this place as one of them had a discount voucher. Worked out well as we had a great yummy dinner and fellowship with our friends as well. What was surprising was that the restaurant was full on a Wednesday evening. Some of the dishes were not replaced fast enough and you had to go back a second round to get the dish you had been eyeing. However, the array of dishes is good and all enjoyed having the sumptuous dinner. A hit with our group was the crab, BBQ sotong, durian pudding and salmon sashimi... Would have been better if the restaurant could allow diners to leave at or after the stated closing time of 10.30pm. We had to vacate the place before 10.25pm.
2
Had my buka puasa with my Malay friends. Even though the company was great, the food left a lot to be desired. The quality of the spread was not great. Most of the offerings was pretty pedestrian and the pricing was too high for what it offered. Even worth the 50% discount it wasn't worth it. Probably won't go there again.Save your money & go someplace else
3
The Asian market cafe brunch is one place where you have a huge spread - suits every cuisine but it does lack quality. Its about breadth of dishes and not really the quality. Though I must say its affordable and if you have a big family this place makes sense. The crab is a let down and so is many of the items...the deserts are not something you die for...I'd still go there when my pocket is light and I want to binge eat..
5
The restaurant is a buffet style concept with good DIY stations and serve local delicacies. This gives you a taste of what you are expecting when you are in Singapore. My suggestion is if you are staying either at the Fairmont or Swissotel try that place the first night to know what the food around Singapore will be and how it will be since the food in this place is very delicious and authentic
3
Amongst the buffet offerings is "fried bee-hoon" done in the same style as in Hawker Centre with just bean sprouts and a few miserable chye-sim stalks. But this restaurant loses out to Hawker Centre by using laksa leaf powder (hardly any fragrance) instead of freshly chopped laksa leaves
3
Was greeted with a warm welcome by the staff in the restaurant. However, attentiveness off the wait staff have much room to improve. The display of food and the quality of dishes have much room to improve. For dining in a restaurant in a hotel, it felt as I was dining in a coffee sho
3
Excellent variety .. good service but noisy.
They provided delicious pastries for my friends birthday . Must go for all local treats !
4
We had dinner at and we were well taken care off. Staff Laurent did exceptionally well and rendered her service where needed. Food was plenty and warm.
5
Everything was amazing, it was my birthday and the staff were super friendly. Definitely will come again and my boyfriend like it there too!
4
Service is very good. The food quality has improved since I went there last year. Food replenished well and timely. Waiting staff all very pleasant and polite. Will patronise again.
5
Bit like a canteen but the food was excellent with lots of choice, included prawns, fish stir fry and curries.
4
Another convenient feed stop just minutes away from the Fairmont Hotel room. The international buffet dinner here was more inclined towards Asian and Singaporean dishes as opposed to Cafe Swiss. There was a wide spread of dishes in a long section running the length of the restaurant. It looked small from the entrance but the restaurant extended a long way in. While there were cold seafood choices including snow crab legs, prawns, oysters and raw salmon, the main attraction was the Asian and local cuisine. We had grilled squid, chilli crabs, fried rice, fried noodles and stir fried vegetables. Desserts including a cold durian paste, ice kacang, cakes and ice cream.When we thought we had taste the length of the buffet counter, we realised that was another running parallel to the first. It had a soup, self-help laksa, Malay and Indian roti prata section. There was still refillable coffee and tea. It was challenge leaving the restaurant without feeling the weight of all that food. Service was friendly, polite, helpful, and plates were cleared away quickly despite the full covers
2
I used to go to Asian Market CafÃ© for the satay and chilli crab. But things have changed. No more satay usually. And the last time, they used Snow crabs I think for the chilli or pepper crab dish. NOT nice at all! Seems very little that's good to eat these days
4
Ate here twice while attending a conference. Buffet had good variety, but none of the food was memorable other than the very juicy watermelon at the fruit bar. Waiting staff was very attentive and seating was comfortable. Would eat here again but would not go out of my way to do s
4
If you like Asian food, this is the place to try different cuisines quite authentic. Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Peranakan, Nonya & Malay dishes freshly prepared & served hot. From appetisers to full range of desserts including both hot & cold drinks. It's popular with families & big groups , you need to book early. Chilli crab, Prata, Char Kway Teow, Chicken rice et al. Leave room for delicious durian pudding if you're a fan ! Although it's a buffet, friendly staff are informative & helpful to make sure you get what you're looking for
5
Visited here whilst staying at The Fairmont. Had tried to get in the previous evening but it was full so we booked. If you book through the hotel you get 2 for 1 on the food. We did not know this when we booked, it just came as a pleasant surprise when we got the bill. The place was very busy, full of locals, which is always a good sign. The service was absolutely first class. Could not fault it. There was a good selection of shellfish for starters including prawns, crab and oysters. The selection of other foods was pretty wide in all types of Asian cuisine. The curries were my favourite. Also a very wide selection of desserts. Every time you finish a dish the staff clear your plate and bring you a new one. Make sure you go with a very empty tummy. We thoroughly enjoyed it.
5
Love the wide selection of buffett spread.
Plus the 1 FOR 1 promotion was defitnely value for money.
Would go there again.
1
There was continuously no food at the buffet.
The staff could not keep up, as soon as a platter of food was put out people would almost fight for it, then it would take 15 min for more food to come.
4
Certain credit cards entitle u to 50pc discount so that's very good value but u must enquire else dont expect the staff to offer this info. Food quality is great but they ration the oysters so tightly that it gets frustrating. Each time they only make a few oysters available (means it runs out all the time) and each person is only entitled to 3.
3
It was on our company dinner arrangement with Colleagues from Indonesia and Malaysia.The crab will be the most exciting part and not many choices available. You may try the Japanese sashimi corner or Prata Corner.The service is great and staff are attempting on every enquiry
2
This place has been the venue for quite a number of office lunches since I joined my current department about 6 years ago. We have also held business dinners here, even graduation parties. Standards have always been good over the past few years, the durian paste dessert was always a favourite. Imagine our shock by the terrible standards of the food when we went there last Friday. It was a far cry from what we remembered. The black pepper crab had a very chemical taste, the selection at lunch was poor, and the durian paste dessert was watery and bland. Granted their sashimi was still quite good and so were the prawns, but generally standards have plummeted. Would be quite a while before we ever consider coming back again
4
Food quality has gone up - previously, the chilli/pepper crabs were mushy (not fresh). Now, they are succulent and the steamed fish is NOT overdone. But it'd appear that the buffet variety is less now (eg, no steamed appetiser). Also, I still hate it that they give laksa leaf powder which is not as fragrant as the chopped leaves. For a restaurant of Swisshotel standing, using laksa leaf powder exposes a lack of culinary pride
5
Been here twice and todays service was just exceptional. Service staff Daniel especially was outstanding attention to detail. His fellow colleages indian gentleman was briliant folding my napkin everytime Im away from the table. Restaurant manager gentleman from Philippines I gather was absolutely polite and professional. I cannot fault the service nor the scrumptious food. 5 star service and affordable price!! I will be back it will be my 1st choice. Well done to the crew of thos restaurant.
4
One of the few halal buffet options in Singapore. The best part of the buffet was the durian pudding, chilli crab with freshly made prata and the staff, who are friendly and efficient. The spread was limited compared to the pricier options. I as looking forward to more meat
4
The menu for Buffet was sumptuous. Lobster, oysters, prawns. Sashimi, and lots of salad. Cut of beef. Asian dishes n even Indian Prata. But the Hainanese chicken rice was a disappointment. The laksa was over cooked on simmering fire. Nonya kuehs and fruits, Bobo Cha Cha for desserts, The saving grace was the durian pudding. Considering the spread it's still pricey because of the quality of the food.
4
Went there for dinner. Not too bad an ambience. Area spacious enough for group gatherings. Food wise, limited sashimi - only salmon available (quite disappointed). However there are other stuffs like sushi, oysters, prawns, mussels & snow crabs. The top up was quite fast. Apart from those, there are asian dishes like roti prata, nasi brayani, laksa, chicken rice and even bandung and teh tarik. There are also a variety of deserts. Taste wise, decent. Cannot really complain. Wait stuffs were efficient in clearing plates
4
The spread was good and the prawns was so fresh. The prata was so good and light to eat.However there should be more cakes..
4
Its a Good place for large gathering! Had a Nice time with good food and company! Most of my friends Love the seafood spread! Well know for their Yummy durian moose!! Should get it a try!!
4
This buffet restaurant features many local Singaporean dishes and a plethora of options for all tastes.
3
imagine paying $80 for chicken rice , prata , limited dessert , a chilli crab , maybe dory fish , prawn ,steam chicken ,depleted sushi offering ,depleted oyster which is always never topped up or hogged by greedy dinersso ,what's nice - the grilled lamb is awesome ,rogh gosh is quite good with egg prate, of course the durian pudding is kinda signature , after trying a 3 plates of the variety , u get bored with whats there....
4
I Was suprised that for lunch buffet, they also served different ways of cooked crab... I prefer salted egg yolk, Chili crab & Malaysian curry crab. They need to improve on Korean style crabs, found a bit of the crabs are not very fresh... the varieties of crabs at the end compensate my crave for oyster as they do not have raw oyster during lunch... overall taste not bad quite worth to go for 50% promotion..
4
Have been dining here again last week. The buffet spread was good. Many different crabs cooked in different style. However, I truly enjoy the sashimi, oyster and long leg crab. Overall family enjoy dining here. Have been our 4th visit with Amex. Will recommend people to dine here. Moreover, this is one of the halal cert buffet in Singapore
4
Imagine that you will have a free flow of chilli crab. It is great because this crab dish is not only tasty but also Halal certified. The crabsâ€™ legs are big, tantalizing with fleshy and succulent meat. The chilli sauce is yummy, jazzing up the crab meat and deep fried mantous with its sweet and sour tastes
4
Forming an arc around the building this restaurant does not feel as large as it is. It is well lit, fresh, cool and, despite the size and crowd, quiet.There is an enormous buffet with a multitude of dishes from all over Asia and the subcontinent. You can make up your own laksa. The only criticism is that the curries and chilli dishes that one could expect to be spicy were too mild
3
Family and I were headed to Prego but instead we decided to try the lunch buffet here. The spread was average, they had mussels, sashimi and other Asian food.Food quality was decent, the highlight of the meal for us was the durian pudding ! It's really good so make sure you have a taste of that !
1
Just joined my used-to-be restaurant list.Food was not top up. I did not get to touch a single oyster. Oyster section was top up only once the whole time I was there. I was sitting right opposite it.Sashimi was down to only salmon. One type. And I mean a small tray 10cm by 10cm tray. I was not allowed to put the bottle of wine I ordered on the table.Went there with 8 persons. For the amount spent, think I can eat at many places many times over
4
Good variety of food from different culture. Local delights is very flavourful. Nice environment, good staff
5
Had lunch at Asian Market Cafe on Sunday. The food was good quality and the variety was not bad. But the stand out factor was the service. It was very attentive and Kelvin especially was really good. Enjoyed our lunch!
4
The buffet spread is really good, there's a lot of choice and it taste good too. Good to go in a group as the spread there will definitely satisfy everyone cravings. Attentive staffs and service.
5
Good selection of Indian, Malay, Chinese cuisines. Hot and cold asian desserts. Chilli crab. Eat till your tummy contents
1
Simply put. Do not go there. Nothing much too eat with terrible service. What 5 star hotel will have this type of restaurant? Even with 50% discount as Fairmont guest, it was not worth the price.
5
The food is Ok here, be honestly, the choice is not too surprise for me. But, why I still give the high level comment? Because of this restaurant have one fantastic waitress, her name is Lauren. Lauren is very kind and sweet, she notice whatever I want before I ask and request, and I know the day I join is very busy, but she never lost her smile for every guests. Lauren really make my day, my friend also have a great time too. Thank you Lauren, this score is for your killer smile and excellent service, well done
5
The ambiance of the restaurant was excellent on the overall. Visited the restaurant for dinner buffet on the second Friday of August and the crowd was not as bad as I expected it to be. A lady greeted us at the entrance of the restaurant, before getting another waitress to usher us to our table. It was a wide spread of buffet and we could not get enough of everything! Not only was the food great, the service was excellent as well. The waiters cleared our plates promptly once they noticed that we were not using it, freeing up some space on the table, and thus enabling us to get more food from the buffet spread. Not only so, one of the waitress even brought us a bowl of lemon water to wash our hands in when she saw us carrying plates of seafood back to the table. Really great form of initiative as no prompting or request were needed from us. I have also noticed that the chefs were actively changing the various buffet dishes that are running out or have ran out, especially the seafood and durian paste! Thank you Asian Market Cafe for such a wonderful dining experience
5
Been a long time since we last came here. Received good attention and service from the beginning till the end - recommending dishes, topping up water and changing cutleries. The restaurant offered a wide variety of Asian menu - Chinese, Malay and Indian. My favourite was the Prata live station. Prata made was crispy, grilled with a nice burnt and most importantly, not oily. To those with sweet tooth, the pengat durian, Portuguese tarts and kuihs are to die for. Oh yes, they do offer seafood, sashimi and sushi spread too.You just got to come here. Check out for card discount or promos else be prepared for a little pricey buffet
2
Decided to celebrate one of our friends birthday here with a buffet treat for her.We only chose this place as it was certified Halal and we had muslim friends with us.Reservation was made for 7pm on a thursday evening.And we informed the reservation dept that its our friend's birthday as well.1. The food was very disappointing. Roast beef was the only saving grace.2. The roti prata was pretty good.3. The rice dishes; seafood fried rice and chicken rice was horrible.4. The hainanese chicken for the chicken rice was NOT topped up and left with bones and this was at 830pm.5. By 9 pm there wasnt any more topping up of food especially desserts. And we heard people grumbling there wasnt any more cakes.6. Dessert spread was pretty limited. Desserts was average.7. There was no braised duck at all throughout the buffet as advertised.8. The chefs manning the meat station were not carving the meat and people had to constantly and politely remind them including myself.Overall, i was very disappointed in the food. For a 5 star establishment like fairmont . I would highly recommend Carousel from Royal plaza and AquaMarine as a much better Halal buffet alternative
5
It is nice place to have lunch or dinner with family and friends. There is variety of food from chicken Rice to Malay favourites and Indian food. Their pepper crab and durian pudding are hot favourites. Small children will love the ice creams. Their cold food (mussels and oysters and tiger prawns) is also a hot favourite. Satay and Roti prata have long queue and are quicky picked up the moment they land on the serving plate.
5
Friend meet-up for dining. Good food and service. Recommended for this cafe dining. Very good service too.
4
Enjoyed the cold seafood table. The varieties of food was too much for me to sample all. Love the Chilli crabs as always.
4
We heard about tis place n thought we should go and try it out ..... Thsnk GOD we did ....Food was good , Service was excellent..... They were very observant...whenever or plates was dirty , they would come and change our plates ......I would love to go back to tis place for makan again.
5
The food was great. Very friendly staff. Good service. Comfort feeling and nice ambience. Value for money. Really love the Durian Pudding!!! Highly recommended to friends and family
4
Having had the option of 3 buffets close by our hotel we decided to try the Asian Market Cafe. With their live Asian style market stalls to choose from, made it a fun interactive experience. From their signature Singapore chilli crab, iced seafood, amazing roti which is made right in front of your eyes, juicy satay sticks and shaved ice dessert, made this buffet stand out. Not only was the food delicious but the staff were amazing. Extremely attentive, well mannered, friendly and very informative. A huge thanks to Shiny one of the staff their, you gave us a memorable experience and probably the best customer service we have received during our Singapore stay. Beatrice who I think is the floor manager, thank you for your hospitality and informative knowledge regarding your food. A very enjoyable evening for my husband and I.
3
This is a buffet restaurant serving local malay style halal food. Recommended only for muslim. If you are non muslim, you can get better food somewhere els
4
I was there for a catchup session with my NS mates. Food was great for the usual price of about $80/pax. The seafood variety was ok, with oysters, mussels, snow crab legs, sashimi. They also have the usual cook yourself stalls, like laksa. Many variety and it is also a halah restaurant which makes it great for company or reunions.For now, there is a 1 for 1 deal for OCBC cards. Pls note there is a limit of 8 pax per card
5
I've had a buffet lunch here, which was just awesome! Name any street food in Asia you can think of, they have it here! From fresh oyster, to chili crab, to otak otak, murtabak, and to-die-for dessert. The good thing is, all ingredients are halal. My mind was blown away to taste the durian and the chocolate cake. They're so gooooood I wish I could just stole the whole jar of the durian paste. If I wasn't dragged down to attend our next meeting, I bet someone need to dragged me away from this restaurant. Prepare your tummy for the whole great food experience!

This is my third time at the restaurant, and the first I am trying out the dinner buffet. Food is excellent as usual (the durian pudding was the best) , but I felt the boiled crabs were a tad too salty.Loved that the server took the initiative to ask if we wanted hot beverages.
4
Went in as party of 8 for buffet dinner. This place is halal certified. Spread was good. Full of local dishes like laksa, Prata, satay, durian pudding etc. cold dish spread includes Crabs, prawns, salmon and oysters. Popular dishes like oysters and Satays run out very quickly but they are not being replenish quick enough. This really ought to be improved. Staffs were very friend and clears your used plates very quickly. Prices– Lunch buffet: Mon to Fri $55++ (adult) $28++ (child 6-12 yo)– High Tea buffet: Sat & Sun $48++ (adult) $26++ (child 6-12 yo)– Dinner buffet: Mon-Sun $65++ (adult) $33++ (child 6-12 yo
4
Where do I begin, is probably the question you will have on your mind when you have the buffet here. Good food, decent service. Was here for lunch and the place was crowded. Try the cheese paratha and chicken curry.
4
Good authentic local buffet lunch - it was crowded with convention guests. Satay, stingray, durian dessert, laksa, teh tarik etc.
5
Love their chilli crab, prata, Tom yum goong, etc. Dishes were replendished quivkly. The staff was friendly and helpful.
5
Had buffet dinner with my family. So much to choose from! Especially love the fresh oysters... Yum yum Restaurant was full to the brim but service was attentive. Definitely coming back again!
4
Love the special Ramadan buka pusa spread! It has most of their restaurant's favourites and special middle eastern dishes! A must visit every year! Only down side is that it's wildly popular and very crowded... The oysters barely make a guest appearance and don't get topped up enough.
4
Went there for lunch. Good selection of food but missed the laksa which was replaced by beef soup noodles. Tandoori chicken wrap was dry. Should have rojak instead of cuttlefish kangkong which doesn't taste good. Cold items like scallop and prawns were good as always. So was the durian pengat. Coffee needs to be improve

I had a pleasant dinner experience at Fairmont as it was one of the few halal buffets around. Nice place to eat with muslim colleagues. Service was great with polite servers who were quick on their feet.Decided to bring my family there after knowing the 50percent promotion. Called the line and was cut off twice as the voice was muffled. Third time, a woman with an accent answered. When I inquired about the promotion, she did not have the patience to listen to me. She cut me off many times and talked at the same time I was talking. It was very unpleasant. When I finally got her to listen to my questions, she asked me for my first name. As a Chinese, my first name is my surname. She impatiently asked me for my first name again. I was perplexed. Can a 5star hotel pls educate the staff what first names are in the local context? I thought it is an Asian restaurant and not otherwise? Pls do not interrupt your customers' enquiries. Being in the service line means one has be willing to answer inquiries. If not, pls do not be at the front line and mire the customers' experience. We are not ignorant Asians.

Making reservations here was an unpleasant experience. The person taking the reservations spoke English with an accent that was very difficult to understand. He should be replaced as he gives the restaurant a bad first impression. From what I can understand, I was told to give my credit card number to reserve a table. Then was told that if I cancel with less than 48 hours notice, i have to pay the entire full price for the number of people I reserved the table for!The food was quite nice but the replenishment was very slow. The best thing in my opinion was the fried chicken which was never replenished. It was not even 9 pm and they had no oysters, no ice-cream in the buffet line. I asked before it was replenished. I did this three times.The best part of the dinner was the two servers who were efficient & polite. Only mistake was that one of them forgot the coffee she said she would bring to the table.i was told that we would be given a complimentary cake since we are celebrating a birthday. Not sure where the cake went but it didn't come to our table.There are many other better places to eat at. Eat here only if you have a 50% discount voucher.They get a poor rating from me because of the above
4
Booked buffet dinner through Amex Palate Program. Overall the buffet is quite good. Wide varieties of seafood, and local delicacies. Seafood quite fresh and they have chili crab and live station. Good and value for money. Will definitely come here again with family. The facade and ambience of the restaurant need improvement. The restaurant provide a feeling that the furnitures and colors were tired. Overall, we love the food. Service was good too
5
Such a vast selection of Asian cuisine.So many Singapore signature dishes one which stole the show was pepper crabs...simply out of this world .Very messy to eat but believe me its worth it and more.there home made waffles and ice cream was divine.There is so much food but its practically not possible to taste everything.it was very busy,so not an ideal place to go for a romantic dinner or lunch. we went in a big group and everybody had a fun time
5
A good selection of Singapore signature food. The durian pudding is fantastic. The prawn and snow crab legs are fresh.
4
Food was good just that atmosphere was a bit noisy. Probably there were about 2 or 3 groups in that area.
4
The variety of Asian foods are spoil for choice. The dessert section was really yummy. You need 2 stomach to fill most of the foods. Must come back again.
5
We booked a table for 8 on the first day of Chinese New Year and it was a beautiful experience through and through. Excellent food display, extensive selection and flawless decor - not to mention prompt service too.
2
Buffet dinner starts at 6pm. By 7pm, the oyster selection has finished. The restaurant simply refused to replenish the oysters despite my numerous reminder to its chef and service staffs. When we left at 8.45pm, there was still no sign of the fresh oysters. It was certainly not worth the money. This shall be my last visit and certainly will not return again.
4
Food is great, I love how they put aside the sauce for the chilli crab so its easier to scoop out just the sauce to eat with bread.The cereal prawn is also good, although prawns are sometimes not that fresh.However they are slow to top up the food that is finished
5
We had lunch here on a rainy lunar new year's eve. The buffet went along three sides of a fairly large restaurant with superbly prepared offerings encompassing a variety of cuisines. Very attentive staff took us by the hand and led us to their most tempting offerings such as Laksa, probably because we were, obviously, the only non-locals in this busy restaurant. Offerings from classical Chinese dishes to fresh seafood and sushi, plus a great display of Malasian and Singaporean food and desserts
4
Oysters, alakan crab, crayfish, mussels, prawns were all there. However, it doesn't seem so fresh. It felt like it has been there or kept for quite some time. Only served salmon sashimi and other sushis. I like their BBQ food section and their chilli crabs. They had interesting variety asian food e.g. chinese, indonesian bbq and had a DIY rojak. Their cordial juice was good too. Interesting mix. The ambience though was too loud. The sound quality in the cafe/restaurant was just bad. So, you can forget about having family or private catching up with each other. Just go there, eat and out you go
5
Located on Level 2 of the Singapore Swissotel Stamford this restaurant offers a reasonably priced buffet meal that includes full compliment of seafood, Asian and Indian inspired cuisine.The service was exceptional with very attentive wait staff.We visited on our second attempt as we had not made a reservation. It is suggested that you make a reservation if planning to visit Friday through Sunday nights.There is more than enough to satisfy your appetite and at a cost of approx $95 for 2 including a couple of drinks this was a reasonably priced evening.Families would be just at home here with many large and small groups being catered for on the night we were there
4
Went there for Christmas lunch and the tables had Christmas party stuff to help all diners get into the mood. The spread was fairly decent with both local and western food. Some of the good stuff : very thick and yummy laksa (which you cook yourself), salmon sashimi, fresh prawns, tom yum fried rice, nasi bryani. The durian pudding/penget was especially good and the teh tarik (made on the spot) was just nice (not too sweet!). Deserts were plentiful so leave some space!Only minor gripe was that the tables around the food area were quite closely spaced so fairly difficult to cut across to the other side. But guess they were just trying to maximise the number of tables.Good place for special family occasions. Full price is about $72++ for lunch, but look out for credit card promotions
4
The food variety and quality were up to standard - vast Asian choices to choose from but the environment was a bit too chaotic.
4
Place is crowded due festive season. Selection was standard with cold seafood and hot items but limited. Service was prompt and excellent. Price indeed was a catch for OCBC cardholders due 50% discount at December period.
3
Good variety of Asian cuisine. Truly good variety. Price is acceptable and affordable. Spicy cuisine for most dishes.
However, the quality of food can be improved. A must try dish is the Laksa. Truly Singapore’s taste.
4
One of the best buffet ever.No regrets going to this place.Gorgeous selections of food especially the yummilicious desserts.They even have the coveted sarabat the tarik!One word 'Wowza'!
5
Been there several times. The food variety is good where there is fresh seafood (oysters, prawns, crabs), fresh salmon, local dishes. For dessert, must try the durian pudding.
2
Went for dinner buffet on 22 Dec. Looking forward to fresh oysters but only see the label. Always empty. Did not get to eat a single oyster. Other dishes are Ok. But you can get these at much lower price at other restaurants that don't serve oyster.
4
Asian market buffet $60 per head. Quite a nice spread for Christmas. As we age we eat less at the same time we want to enjoy good foods.So we select food that we most love and enjoy. We had salmon sushi 2 helping very fresh, steam prawn 5 pcs very fresh, 2 pcs of chillies crab (not as nice as seafood restaurant) I also try a very small portion of the laksa (not nice) Next we have dessert kueh and cake few small cut of pineapple plus a cup of coffee to finish our meal. The dessert corner was well decorated and taste is nice
4
We had a dinner for five and we had a great evening - the food was fresh and often replenished! You need to take your time over all the different types of foods ! We loved the seafood and the Indian flavours. But always leave room for the 'piece de resistance' the fruit and desserts!
4
Took my family for a buffet dinner at this restaurant in Raffles City shopping mall. It had a buffet dinner set up with Asian cuisine. That week, there was a special seafood spread as well. The varieties were very comprehensive, including Chinese, Malay, Indian, local fare, etc. Much more that we could imagine or consume. The dessert spread was excellent, to the delight of our family. Though it was not cheap, the quality and varieties made it good value for our money. The service was very good, considering the crowd they were handling
5
Really enjoyed the seafood buffet dinner at Asian Market Cafe. The snow crabs, oysters, clams, mussels and prawns were fresh. The oysters were very popular. You got to keep an eye on when they top them up as they go fast. The salmon sashimi was fresh too and not served and controlled like some other buffets.Scissors and nut crackers are provided at your table without being asked. Bowls of water are placed on the table to wash your hands. The buffet comes with coffee or tea and is served when requested.Price of the buffet is steep at $70++ but becomes a good deal with The Far Card. Would definitely recommend and go again in future
4
I was there because of a seminar where lunch was served there. Food was great with a wide variety of selection both local & international variety.
Recommend that you try their desserts which were highly recommended.
Service was prompt too.
4
The title says it all! Eat all you can! The food selections are great ranging from Singaporean, Japanese, etc. I especially have a bias for their seafood spread. They were fresh and great! Dessert options were also fantastic. Overall, it was a great lunch.
5
Being my first time in Singapore, I was treated to the Asian Market Cafe experience. The food at lunch was simply outstanding - providing the diner with a massive selection of local and international dishes. Loved trying the durian fruit dishes!
5
Superb food, cheap prices but unequivocally fresh - quality produce. Why eat lunch or early dinner anywhere else during working week?
4
A bit on the expensive side, however there is a great selection. Very popular with locals. Dine early to avoid the rush.
5
Great for family..frens..couples to have makan gathering here.
Lots of foods to select n yummy especially the cili crab!
Enjoy the ambience n great service!
5
We went on a tuesday night and were surprised to see a lot of people dining. Mostly in group and celebrating birthdays. It was a busy night but the staff were attentive.They have a wide varities of food; from seafood to local dishes. My eyes were feasting and didn't know where to start. Great food, convenient location, friendly staff, reasonable price, what more can you ask for? In my opinion, $70++ for dinner is definitely worth it. They also have Teh Tahrik which is my favourite! I highly recommend this place for those who love seafood and Asian food
5
This is a wonderful place for different kinds of food as below,Chilled Seafood on Ice with Condiments, Salad with Dressing and CondimentsMesclun Salad, Romaine Lettuce, Cherry Tomato,(Thousand Island, Honey Mustard Dressing, French Dressing)(Fried Shallot, Toasted Sesame Seed, Dried Prawn, Fried Garlic)ingapore RojakCucumber, Chinese Turnip, Pineapple, Chinese Croissant, Tau PokBean Sprout, Ground Peanut, Rojak SauceIt is much beautiful and attracting place. I visited this with my family in the month of April, 2015

I had dinner at the Asian Market Cafe recently. As it's Ramadan period, there extra Arabian style buffet spread. The food is great and there is quite a lot of variety to choose from. The seafood is quite fresh and there is plentiful supply of oysters which has been constantly topped up. Service is great. Staff will walk through with you the buffet line and explain to you about the different stations. We were most impressed with the service especially from Jerome, Kate and Olivia whose service and warmth exceeded our expectations. This will be the number one reason for us to come back. They offer cold drinks such as Soya Bean, Bandung, Pineapple and Cranberry juice as well. There is also a drinks station doing Teh Tarik etc... The durian pudding, marinated squid and oysters are highly recommended. Far Card members should come more often!
3
If I didnt got a discount as a Far card member, i would think value of the buffet vs the spread and taste is not that worth. It is definitely NOT lousy but I would expect more for a 5-star hotel buffet in term of quality of the food.
5
The food is good and service is great! oysters are a little small but tasted fresh. snow shell crab is good though a little salty. the durian puree is awesome!
4
I don't like buffets, but we found the selection of food to be good & the quality was very good value for money. To top it off, we found the Service to be very friendly & helpful.
5
great place too eat, good choices and the price in Singapore is a good value, lots of choices and a must if you are in the area.
3
Visited this place two to three times already. First time was the best. Quality was really good. My most recent visit however was quite disappointing. Quality of food has gone down and spread is all Asian. In the past, they even had seasonal spreads but now, it seems they're cutting back. Price is steep and not real value for money. Would I revisit? Probably not. I'll head to aquamarine instead ;
2
We have tried many buffets in Singapore.We arranged for a farewell dinner for a friend. Though this was not our first choice, after reading various reviews on trip advisor we thought that this place was worth a trip. The price of SGD 70++ excluding soft drinks was higher than the best rated buffet in this category. Though the restaurant website boasts of buffet which includes sea food, Japanese (Sashimi and Sushi), Indian, Local (Chicken rice, chillli crab), Western food and of fresh oysters, which are also so much talked about in other reviews here is the reality:1. The Japanese counter only had Salmon Sashimi and nothing else.2. The Indian counter did not even have chicken curry. It took 15 minutes to get a paratha. 3. The Oyster counter was empty for most of the time, it seems they have a quota or limited supply for them and don't replenish them readily. This situation remained the same when the restaurant was half empty.4. There was some Arab food which was tasty with various sauces5. The salad bar was worse than what is provided in some semi-fast food restaurants6. The roasted lamb carcass was chopped up rather than sliced and the cook mixed up all the bones, fat and the meat.A number of times food dishes were found empty. Unlike buffet's in its category where the food is replenished regularly some how here it seemed that there was a lack of supply. Overall the restaurant was in a run down condition.The staff were very friendly and helpful.A price of SGD 70++ / head + drinks, is too high for this kind of restaurant and food. Far well below the rated 5 star.The management seriously needs to get its act together. We will never go to this restaurant again
5
I had my anniversary dinner with my husband there and I must say the food is awesome and the service is prompt. Fresh seafood and savoury local dishes. I ate to my heart content. Sure it will get roudy during dinner rush hour but I don't really mind. Will definitely go back for those oysters
4
Went to this cafe for a buffet dinner...there was plentiful delicious food of all types...I don't normally go for salmon sashimi but I did this time as they were so delicious -creamy and smooth. Try the lamb chops and the local food available - the chicken rice was very nice! I recommend this cafe.
5
The restaurant serves a good spread of asian buffet (Peranakan,Japanese, Indian, Chinese food etc). I particularly enjoyed the raw oysters, cold crab and sashimi. My children liked the fresh prawns and chilli craps. My wife craves for the durian pengat at this restaurant (somewhat like blended durian pulp) and that was one main reason why we were back here whenever we stayed in swissotel or fairmont. The service staffs served with a smile and were always around to refill our drinks and clear the plates from the table. Will definitely be back here again as long as our favourites delights are on their serving counters
5
Thi sretsurant is amalagmation of wide variety of asian cuisines...so much of choice to make... it easily spoils you & tmepts you to over-eat...Enjoyed sumptuous meals with friends & colleagues 2 days we dined at this place... the best part is thjeir service is warm, authetic flavors of different cuisine you can sample..my fav was singapore's chilli crabs but i did enjoed laksa as well as indian food... so didnt miss my home food too...a must visit place with family & friends..

Had buffet dinner at Asian Market CafÃ© on 6 Mar 2015.Nice: - salmon sashimi- oysters (forever in need of replenishment, have to keep requesting/waiting)- cheese-n-egg prata - durian pudding (authentic / how to have durian without struggling to open the fruit & getting fingers sticky) - rich chocolate ice creamNot-so-nice:- Crabs overly salty. Scissors provided are actually not meant for cutting up crabs, so you have to fight with your food :DThe rest is normal - maybe this spread is ok for tourists who want to sample local food, but not worth it to spend sgd 80++ per head for local food!Service is ok - dirty plates are generally removed fast, and staff do comply with requests and try their best
5
They're friendly and fast in service especially clearing up the plates. The food are good especially the grilled section are awesome.
5
Wonderful service (quite personalized) with an array of comprehensive first class food. The waiter even request with the manager for a special birthday cake:)
5
Asian food selection is good. The salmon and prawns were fresh. They had japanese sushi, chinese food in fried and boiled style, indian prata and the traditional milk tea. The highlight was durian pudding. They cleared used plates efficiently
4
Located on 2nd floor in fairmont hotel, the asian market cafe offers local singaporean and asian buffet which is good compared to the usual mediocre buffet restaurants. I loved the variety that they have all the way from sushi to local singaporean and indian food range. Nice south asian colonial ambience
4
A good variety of Asian cuisine - Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Malaysia, Indonesian, small but delicious selection of cakes besides the usual desserts. On the night we were there, the oysters were especially fresh & deliciously sweet although small in size, which didn't matter as you can take as many as you like
4
My office had our end of the year buffet lunch at Asian Market Cafe at Fairmont Hotel on 19 December 2014. Location is convenient as it is in Raffles City where MRT is close by.There was a wide variety of food and selection of food. The prawn and scallop on ice were fresh. I like their chilli crayfish eaten with fried mantou. Unfortunately, I did get to try their coffee or tea. I could not try every dish within the 90 minutes lunch. Staff service is prompt as used plates are cleared quickly. Lunch cost S$65 per head
4
If you happen to be around the City Hall area, you may want to consider dining in at the Asian Market Cafe. It's conveniently located at the Raffles City Mall, 2nd floor.Pros:- reasonably priced - wide selection of Asian cuisines- tasty food- friendly and attentive staff- the restaurant has a perfect view of the surrounding skyscrapers and hotels, that provides a great view of the city as you dine.Cons: - Nothing much, except the restaurant decor is a little outdated. But that's quite insignificant as the great food compensates for it all
4
We had the seafood buffet and it was terrific. Not only seafood but Asian food represented locally, Thai and Indian. There was plenty to choose from. Good fresh produce. Lots of flavor. Unfortunately don't think we could do the SGD70++ justice and of course the wine was expensive, but wine is expensive in Singapore. The restaurant was packed which in itself is a testament of how good the food is
1
send in a feedback form given by the f&b staff of Asian Market Cafe on 6th October to lodge a complain. Till date, i have yet to get any reply.I am not sure if the feedback form was handled well and given to the right person to act on my complaint.Last week, i send in an email to dining reservation agent and also i did not get a reply at all.Thinking that there is no way that no one from Fairmont is getting back to me, i decide to give Scott, Hotel Manager a call and answered by his PA, Janice. Janice does not sound pleasant on the phone and was not helpful at all. i asked for her to pass the message to Scott and for him to reply my call on my complaint.i am shocked that a PA supporting the hotel manager is giving such an unpleasant experience to the guest, a very snobbish lady i must say from the tone over the phone. Not able to get any good hospitality from her even after i shared with her that i am calling to complaint to the Hotel Manager.I am still waiting for Asian Market cafe to explain to me why is it that they lied about serving of the scallops. they came up with tons of excuses of not able for us to enjoy any scallops during our visit and to make do with tiny clams. Bear in mind that we arrived at 12pm and saw the scallops and 5 minutes, it did not appear anymore, despite the staff telling us that chef is preparing and will serve personally to our table when it is done. end of the day, no scallops. On top of that, had a very ugly and not very pleasant experience with Janice, PA to Scott over the phone. Was expecting that a PA will be able to best represent the hotel better as the gate keeper. am very disappointed with how Janice is handling the situation and speaking in a snobbish manner and is just rude to a guest on the phone to be treated in such a lousy manner.I hope someone will be able to resolve this matter soon and to give us a satisfactory reply on our complaint. We understand that Carlos left for jakarta but that does not mean that the service standards has to leave with him to Jakarta as well. I reckon someone in Singapore should be able to maintain an even higher and better standard as well
4
Made advance booking of more than a week for 8 pax at first but i keep on adding till that day. Staff who took my reservation was very friendly aftr I told her that I wanted to add one more. At last there were 12 altogether. Food spread was not bad but hope to have more variety. I love d durian puree n its d best compare to other place. F n B staff all very friendly. Place good n not too crowded
4
Huge choice of seafood with all sorts of other curries and Asian options. Good quality food with inclusive soft drinks.
5
Excellent service by Chope reservations and restaurant staff. Reservation done was convenient and accurate. Restaurant staff were attentive.
4
I like the latte with ham cheese croissant and muffins at good value for money. The environment is clean and service is good
4
A truly amazing selection of dishes from the buffets. Reasonable prices and tasty food. Busy including many locals.
4
This has just about any cuisine from Indian and Malay to American type food too. A good buffet which is refreshed regularly, so everything feels fresh. Great ice cream
4
This cafe is one of my favourites if I want to eat as much as I want. I have been eating at this place for quite a few years, and I must say the restaurant dos make efforts to improve its range of food. In the past, decaffeinated coffee would be chargeable under the buffet pricing, now it is included. While the range of food has almost remained the same e.g. there is always roti prata, the seafood selection and a range of Asian and Western dessert, the cafe does try to vary the cuisine every time.One of my must-try dish is in the dessert section - I will always look forward to the glutinous rice balls. Another I will try is the durian pengyat if it is available. I also like the sushi selection, which is always topped up frequently during the buffet times.If you do want to try the food here, I suggest coming during Saturday afternoons, which is the high tea special, especially if you have young children. The Xbox is made available for kids to play, and there is even balloon sculpture art going on during this time (though limited to 1 to 2 hours only). And the high tea price is reasonable as well. Just make sure you have reservations - there were a couple of times I tried calling to book on Saturdays, but they were full
5
Something unique about this Restaurant - use to be Peranakkan Restaurant Before traditional Nyonya. I'm a frequent Diners at this Restaurant. Wow - food are excellent and service are good. Deco are still same as before last 6 years. Keep up good job and the Chef. Now every one can enjoy since Halal Restaurant
5
Most 5-star hotels serve sumptuous buffet spread but what really stands out here is the service. I have been patronising this place since year 2011. The service has always been great with the staff being attentive to our needs and always serving us with a smile. Today, I had asked if Oxtail Soup is being served at the lunch buffet. After checking the spread, the chef and a staff said that there's no oxtail soup today but there's herbal chicken soup. However 10 minutes later the chef served us a medium size bowl of Oxtail soup without us asking for it. Maybe he felt that he didn't want us to leave feeling disappointed. It was really nice of him and we are very impressed and grateful. Queue for the Roti Prata section was really long today - it went on for more than an hour so we did not managed to get it today. I've tasted it before. It taste really nice so for those who are first timers here, I have to let you know that it is worth the queue. Do try having the Roti Prata with rendang or chilli crab sauce instead of the regular curry. Overall, we love the food here, the ambience and of course the service. I highly recommend this place if you are planning a get together with friends, family or for business. If you are a tourist, this is great place where you can feast on various Singapore / Asian cuisines. Do request for window seat so you can have more comfortable seating. I know many tourist prefer looking out to Marina Bay Sands. So do make this request when you do the booking as the window seats towards the back of the restaurant faces Suntec City
4
Frankly, every decent hotel in the world seems to have this kind of international buffet restaurant, and I've eaten in so many of them now that they kind of merge in to one! This one is cunningly separated from the hotels by the warren-like mall, but is clearly part of the Fairmont/Swissotel complex.Where this one does well is by making the most of Singapore's diverse cuisines, which means it feels a little more authentic than some of the buffets you find in the Middle East. Everything I ate was tasty, and I simply can't resist a dessert buffet, but I wasn't blown away.This is a safe contender for business, group or family meals, as there will be something to suit all tastes, but it just wasn't the best meal I had in Singapore
3
We had a family dinner here last weekend. The restaurant has a Ramadan themed buffet which was great as we got to enjoy a good range of local hawker, Malay, Middle Eastern and international favourites. The standout dishes were the chilli crab, roti jala, roast whole lamb, oysters and sashimi. While it's not the best buffet in town, we were impressed with the efficient, friendly service despite the full house. Our requests for water, coffee, etc were met with cheery smiles. Room for improvement - refill of popular dishes was generally slow and the crowds were often left waiting with empty plates. Overall, we had an enjoyable time
3
My title says everything. The ONLY benefit is it's halal. Otherwise buffet spread was okay. We had buffet dinner here on new year's eve. Price was not hiked up. Cannot recall about the view but the tables were packed closely together, felt very claustrophobic.
4
Good food, fresh, tasty and many variety. Atmosphere surrounding is nice and cosy. Staff very friendly. Price reasonable.
4
Had been to a business meeting .. Nice selection .. Indian food is good ,,, so is the local food.. Good kebabs n shawarma.. Good spread of desserts n ice creams ..
4
Fairly good spread for lunch or dinner. Good place to invite overseas colleagues who may need halal food and Indian food. Ambience is a nice casual. Tiger prawns are fresh, sashimi good variety, though chilli crab can be improved.
5
It is really busy during lunch. When you have the food there you realise why it is so crowded. Great food, lots of options across different Asian cuisines and still yummy
4
Well.. we were here with some promotions so the price was quite reasonable for a local buffet!The food is authentic local Singaporean selection and there was a good variety in the choices so we really enjoyed it!I think they have a slightly different and better selection during the weekdays and we were here on a sunday for a weekend high-tea so some dishes were missing!Favourite was the Laksa and also, nice that apart from local food, they had some fresh seafood selection too : sashimi/prawns etc.
5
We were pleasantly greeted & ushered quickly to our table for 4 without having to queue at all despite the huge crowd in the restaurant. The spread was very good & the selection of choice was ample, appropriate & we're obviously spoilt for choice. Prawns & Black Mussels were fresh, juicy & sweet. Salmon Sashimi were fresh & replenishing was frequently done. Majority of dishes were delicious especially the wide array of local desserts are not to be missed out. Few set-backs were the chicken meat of the chicken-rice & the pepper crayfish which tasted bland. I enjoyed the herbal chicken soup & the beverage juices especially the most sought-after sour-sop. Despite eating so much variety, we didnt have the opportunity to try the Rendang, Indian cuisines, dim sum & other local hawker delights because we were already so full. Hopefully, we get invited back to savour what we missed out. Waiters were pleasant & efficient to clear the table & top up water. Few areas which we hope could improved are the confusing queue at individual push cart & the narrow walk way due to tables arranged too close to food kiosks. We saw many near-missed accidents when diners nearly knock other diners with their plate of dishes when they turned around or suddenly stopped. Kudos to the waiting team, cleaners, servers, kitchen assistants & chefs. Highly recommend for family & corporate gatherings.

Hot food is not hot, cold food it not cold. I got a severe case of food poisoning after eating at this restaurant and was confined to my hotel room for the next 3 days. This restaurant is atrociously overpriced and the food is sub par. Health authorities should come for a visit and take note that foods are served at wrong temperatures
3
Had Hi Tea in December as part of my family Xmas gathering.Food was limited though they had the usual turkey fare. Halal Buffet Restaurant.Ambience too casual. Prefer old style westin Tea Room.No Smiles neither friendliness from the staff.Need play area for Young Children instead of the X Box

I just visited this place yesterday as a friend invited me and I brought my younger son too. Well I love to eat and I would happily go to a buffet but this was rubbish… decor is ok not bad ,makes you feel as though you are sitting in a Malaysia setting area. Drink section - there was only rose drink,lime juice,and tea.When we sat down, we had to ask water to be served, and there was no cold water served , only room temperature water was given, I had to ask for iced water, I took my son to walk around the buffet, There was a Indian section, where there was Briyani rice, butter chicken,Dal and some other stuff.. cold section there was Oysters, Prawns, Sashimi,Japanese food Fruits, Ice cream, Desserts.Now if i compare the quality of food with Straits Kitchen ( i am a frequent there ) ,the food is of very average quality. We had to ask the waiter to clear the tables… there was no waiter/waitress in sight. I have been to Shangrila Sentosa too but this is only place where you need to ask for plates to be cleared, cold water to be given, The food and desserts are of average quality. Thank God I didn't have to pay for it, There were 4 adults and 1 child and the total bill was $282.0

Love the teh tarik. It is a halal certified restaurant. Disappointed that durian penget is no longer served. Found the staff very approachable and helpful.

One of the better hotel buffet. Good spread and wide varieties of quality food. Good place to dine with friends. Satay, chilli crab, roast lamb oysters etc. the taste is good. Price wise it is the same as other hotel buffet.

The buffet offers diversity (with a light focus on local specialities). The food looks good; in fact it looks better than it tastes, because on tasting or close inspection, it is really low-quality. For instance, the Straits Kitchen at the Hyatt is also a halal restaurant focusing on local specialties and is substantially better. Service is acceptable for a buffet restaurant. Atmosphere is more downmarket among Singapore hotel eateries

Our family of four had a splendid time. The restaurant had a Deepavali special for 4 days this month, so the Indian items, at the buffet, dessert DIY and live station counters, were much more than usual. The place is spacious, attentive and helpful service top class also you are really spoiled both for choice and quality, though vegetarians might dispute that. Being accessible from Raffles City mall as well as the hotel, we liked the relaxed and casual atmosphere. So many different kinds of seafood, desserts, types of cuisine and meat preparations is quite the ingredient for a memorable family outing

Service was excellent, and the food on the whole was good. Broad selection of Singapore dishes suited to give a visitor and overview of the local cuisine. ventilation in the restaurant must be improved though as we all ended up smelling of "curry and Chilli crab" after the meal..

Visited this place during F1 Grand Prix in September 2013. A busy period for most places in Singapore. So it was nice to feel special the way we were looked after by the Restaurant Executive Raymond Rodriguez Lomboy.The food is of great quality and there is plenty of it. The choice is more then one can possibly do justice during one visit.So one our next trip to Singapore, this place will be on our itinerary to re visit.The food is priced as you would expect but the wine is some what over the top. But then this is Singapore

It had great variety of local foods, together with wonderful local deserts. The quality was good, and the selection very good, although even for US Standard it was on the pricey side at over $60 per head. however the food courts don't have as much of the old local foods now, so unless one knew which coffee shop to go to, it was convenient to find most of the local food in one place

Having a Team Bonding dinner with colleagues of 28, it was a wonderful experience.Varieties and new foods to experience with, good ambience and excellent services make our dinner enjoyable experience. Most food, foreign, asian and traditional local foods were available.Price may be a bit high but it could be compromise with promotion and discount. We will definitely come back as a group or even on a personal/family visit

Great range of foods from SEAsia, and very welcoming staff. Some foods made to order, others in a large buffet. Very popular, so worth booking. Only reservation was a questionnaire about staff who had been particularly good, and it seemed quite invidious to single anyone out

We went there for belated father's day celebration for extended family. My brother has the far east card with a 50% discount voucher for large group. He called twice to double check the voucher can be used for 6 adults and 2 children, and got an affirmative answer. He checked again before we went into restaurant, and again was told that it is good to use. However, at bill time, the manager came out to tell us that voucher can only be used for 8 pax. Dissappointing that miscommunication occurs at a reasonably high class hotel cafe such as this. And they did not make any attempt to retify the mistake they made in first place.Food wise, good selection of local food. Good variety, and rather tasty. It's a real pity that service was sub par

Not fancy- cafeteria style, but more choices of fodo than you can imagine-- very friendly staff and another great way to get introduced to local and regional food. In the mall adjacent to the fairmont hotel.

Its a buffet dinner. Wide variety of food selection. Great and tasty desserts. The satay n shatwarma or kebabs were fantastic! A restaurant that is Halal certified for Muslims.
5
We had 2 enjoyable lunches there. The food was delicious, the choices of Asian and Indian food was to die for, the service and staff very welcoming pleasant and helpful. You should go there.
5
Delicious chilli crab and teh-tarik (milk tea). Good range of japanese, malay, chinese, western mix of delicacies. Need to book early to avoid disappointment.
4
Great service, varieties and spread is good. From asian to western choices. From cold to got dishes. Fresh oysters, shashimi, sushi and all. Must try ..... Prata and durian pudding.... Sinfully good!
5
Compared to the high tea, dinner buffet was much better value for money. The chilli crab was delicious and so were the fresh shrimp and seafood on ice. The new dishes like the chicken pineapple stew are interesting to try, and the variety of Asian cuisine from this part of the world is remarkable.

We're not normally buffet fans, but had hope to try some new dishes and cuisines. Although the ambiance was fine, and the food selection wide and varied, this was an expensive but forgettable dinner.Having eaten at other restaurants in the Fairmont, we had high hope. Though the food was tasty, it was mostly cold, and served on cold buffet plates. Not terrible, but with so many alternatives, not recommended

Value for money. Food quality has been very consistent, if not better for the few years I have been patronising this restaurant. A great place to bring business associates / friends / families from overseas as they can taste all the local dishes here which includes Chilli Crab, Roti Prata and Teh Tarik. Excellent customer service. DBS credit card always offers promotion - so ask the staff before paying. Also ask for a table that is next to the window so you get a view of the scenery around Marina Bay Sands

A wide selection from cold to hot dishes. Lovers of oysters, shashimi, shrimps and crabs would really enjoy this spread. Take your time to enjoy the spread. Must try the "ayam buah kwa" and if you miss those good old days.......they even have "putu mayam".Durian lover will certainly love the durian puree..yummy !!The place is abit crowded but go prepared and enjoy the crowd and noise.....afterall, you are there for good food

at a reasonable price then go to Asian Market Cafe.One would be spoilt for choices with the variety of food available for consumption. The staff are generally helpful and smile when necessary.There are 2 suggestions I would like to offer:- firstly appreciate hygiene. The waiter dropped our utensils on the floor and then simply out them back on our table. No no nooooo..... He changed it only when asked- secondly some of us are not fans of durians and it is very difficult to sit comfortably when the durian odour starts "spreading" around an airconditioned room. Perhaps have a special corner for durian lovers so that non durian lovers can also dine comfortabl
