This is a place where you can relax and spend quality time with your family, spouse or your girlfriend. Nice views bring peace to the mind. Perfect place to spend an evening. You can also take a walk from there to ECP.

Best to go just before sunset...table by the sea, plane watching with a drink or 2.
Food is great- truffle fries, chicken wings, all meat pizza, alio pasta.

We only had smoothies there but it was a lovely place to sit by the sea as a break in our cycling trip.
Will definitely visit again and sample the food.

I have been to Stella multiple times now. The location of Stella is very nice. It's a great place to sit with your friends and have a drink and chat, whilst listening to the sound of the crashing waves.Tip: This place is best before the sunset. I would strongly recommend reaching at least 1 hour before it gets dark.Food:The food menu is rather simple and lacks courage. If you are too hungry, this may not be the right choice. This place is only good for light snacks. The fries served here are good. For vegetarians, they have garlic bread and a vegetarian pizza (of which I am not a fan)Drink:Unfortunately, like the food menu, the drinks menu is also quite conservative. The beer is really good, but lately they have hiked the prices too. We once ordered tequilla shots, which was not in the menu then. They arranged for it, but it was not served properly and overcharged for it. My overall rating is 3/5 which is mainly due to the location. It's a bit of a shame, that this place is not heading in the right direction. With a new menu and competitive pricing this could easily be one of the great hang out spots in Singapore

I love to hike when I have the time and in Singapore that can be challenging due to the humidity (hydration and chaffing) and Stella Café has been on this route for a few years as I like starting in East Coast Park and finishing up at Changi Beach.But I have always wanted to stop and try the food at Stella as I like to location so much even though they once charged me $3.50 for an isotonic drink. And one day during a 25 km hike I made Stella Café my rest and turn around point so got to sit for lunch on a Saturday.A hamburger and tiger beer came to $35. And the burger had a bun that was so stale that when the guy came to collect the plate I stuck a fork in it and banged it on the side of the table. Loudly. Now I was hungry. I ate the meat (overcooked) and the fries (frozen) but when I complained there was absolutely no discussion. It was a shrug and they walked away.So, if this is your idea of money and time well spent then I recommend Stella Café. I gave this 2 stars as the location is still nice but everything else is crap. Maybe you can sneak in our own food and drink because seeing waitstaff is a rare thing anyway

Nice atmosphere and super windy day!Were here at 7pm on Sun but got a table without reservation! Hmm... suspect...The meat lovers' pizza was really good and the wings here is still as tasty and crispy as expected! Yummy! BUT I was really disappointed with the ribs!! It wasn't the baby back ribs we were expecting but the really longs ribs (just 2 long bones!!) The girls had the chocolate molten... looks good on the outside but they weren't exactly 'wowed'!Overall... great atmosphere but average food for the price

We had dinner at the place last Saturday. The pizza was very nice, while the lamb rack was below bar. The table was next to the water with fresh air and cool breeze but it was under the flight path so it was noisy at time. Services was ok.

Visited twice recently, one visit shortly after the other. Experience was similar. It seems a bit out of the way but that makes this a kind of rustic place. Wonderful sunset views over the sea, Singapore and incoming aircraft. One of Changi's runways is close by. Informal atmosphere and very attentive staff. The food is simple, western and local food, snacks, etc, but none of it has disappointed so far. Good portions, tasty and definitely value for money. On weekdays including Friday, they have happy hour all day long with 1 for 1 beers and house wine and 1 for 1 main course lunches as well during lunch time. The staff was very attentive every time and service was fast. It always seems windy and cool. Great place to hang out and be totally relaxed. Will surely be back

We chose to have dinner at Stella so as to have the ambience of sitting right next to the sea but the rain came and we couldn't do that. Nevertheless, we ordered our food of truffle fries, seafood soup, pasta, pizza, fish and chips and mee goreng for 6 of us. It was enough for all of us and we ended it with desserts like tiramisu and chendol

We tried to dine at Changi village but too crowded. So we drove and ended up at this restaurant along changi coastal road next to nsrcc. Service was prompt. Food came too quickly - within 15 min of order. So we thought maybe pre cooked, since I ordered angus beef median but beef was almost all cooked. But the best thing about this restuatant- by the end of the sea! Rustic environment meant you can come in shorts and slippers and enjoy the sea breeze and the evening sun. Fun for the children watching airplanes landing into changi airport. Will try the restaurant next door for zhi char. Remember to bring your nsrcc card to get 25% discount.
