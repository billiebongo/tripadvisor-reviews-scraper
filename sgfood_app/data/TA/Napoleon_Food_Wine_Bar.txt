I had a great night on the 15th Feb. The bar organized a special event with unlimited cheese and cold cuts !! We had so much cheese that it almost felt like a night in France !! Please do more events like that !!!
5
Yummy tasty lobster risotto and tenderloin with foie Gras. Food took a while to come. Service was good
5
Loved the steak and risotto.
Double loved it with entertainer!
Furthermore, attentive staff and great cosy ambience.
4
Solid bar for wine and very good service. Perfect for after dinner drinks. Need to get there early Thursday and Friday to get an outside table.
4
It has plenty of wine selection and detail description. The place has limited seat, you may need to do a reservation or just come early.
4
Great food, service for main a little slow compared to normal. Steak is superb. We never have room for dessert!

Food wise - the food is good. The wine is good. I've been there for an event with finger food, as well as a cheese buffet and they served good quality cheese and cold cuts for $12++.Service - very disorganized. Manager briefs staff in front of customers when the Buffet is supposed to start, so customer's have to wait for briefing to be over. The buffet was supposed to begin at 6.30pm but we had to wait around 15 min before they were actually ready to begin.Staff doesn't know what kind of wine is being served, seem abit lost. Basically if you are fine with good food but messy service, then go for it. If great service is important for you, avoid it

This place has the worst bar manager in the whole of Singapore. The bar did a cheese cold cuts special on Chinese New Yearâ€™s Eve but ran out of bread within 1.5 hours. I asked the manager whether they would serve more bread and the manager aggressively said that the Ts and Cs of the deal stated that they serve until stock lasts. The manager did not apologise for the lack of bread to go with the cheese but criticised me who was a customer for complaining and not reading Ts and Cs!The cheese and cold cuts were substandard and not worth the money. On promo email sent to us, it said 1 for 1 if we bought a bottle of wine at 90 SGD or more but on the night the manager said it had to be at 120 SGD!!!! We had to show their email to prove what they advertised and they then reluctantly agreed to honour the deal. Overall this was an awful experience and I would highly recommend the restaurant owner reassess its staff and management in order to keep its existing customers.

It was not my first time here but food and service still amazed me.Was really impressed by the herb crusted lamb this time and their amazing lemon tart dessert. I love the vibrant atmosphere and the great service. Even the wines were excellent but reasonably priced which was the perfect final touch to a great evening. I definitely recommend

Dinner at Napoleon was a lovely experience. The food was excellent and the wait staff were friendly and helpful.The prices are not cheap for their portion sizes but they are all high quality and well cooked. We used the Entertainer app vouchers which helped alleviate the prices.The atmosphere is lively but not too loud so we could still have conversions easily. I would definitely revisit this restaurant.
4
Food was good. So was the atmosphere and service. Slightly pricey though.
Recommend for after work gatherings with friends.
4
Amazing food! And great service. Plus tasty drinks. An ipad is left on the table so you can order what you want, when you want and it’ll arrive within minutes.
Happy hour from 5-8 so recommend arriving then!
5
As a French, I can certify that this restaurant is authentic French cuisine.
The staff is really nice also.
Thanks
5
Got the card and tasted the wine before our full bottle.
Both food and wine are good. The service was very good too!
4
The foods was really good with the pricing I’m paying. The service crew was also attentive and give recommendation. The ambience further enhances the whole experience
1
I went in at 12, ordered at 1215. They said the salmon would take 20 mins but they served it at 1 and guess what? It was raw! To top that the owner or manager made us pay for the remaining food and argued his case of how his dishes cant be wrong. Never ever going back - atrocious service
3
Good place for pre party drinks on a weekend with friends. Reasonably priced wine and food with AMEX 50% discount. Food wise is decent but not fantastic. Dessert platter is a good way to share a bottle of wine with friends.Overall, the warm and attentive services made up for a good dining experience
1
Came here after highly recommended by many friends. We placed an order for lobster risotto and BBQ pork at 8pm,after 8.34pm we reminded the waiter for our food, she said usually the food is cooked very slowly and she will try to expedite. 8.44pm another server came and told us sorry our system didn't received your order so you will have to wait for another 30mins for the food to be ready. She didn't even have the courtesy to give us free soup or any discounts as a token for screwing up our order. We have to wait for another 30minutes which is preposterous, so she said she will do something special for us, came back and said food will be ready in 5mins instead. In my opinion, poor customer service and with the extravagant pricing I expected more. I will not recommend this place at all. Food is just ok and not something I would shout about
4
Overall ambience was nice and cozy, even though the space was just alittle small. The food was very tasty. The Burrata was a great start as an appetoser. The salmon we got was very juicy and tender, while the 2 other pastas we got were also done just right. Interesting wine concept but unfortunately we didn't drink.
5
I treated a good friend for a birthday dinner and picked this place. Iâ€™m glad I did. The restaurant setting is very cozy and romantic, definitely a date place. Though there was some confusion with our wine order, someone more experienced came and explained that the particular wine is not available but recommended something based on our preference. For main course I ordered the grilled angus beef tenderloin Rossini cooked medium rare (default recommendation on the iPad) and the meat melted in my mouth. The foie gras was also very nice and so were the veggies (mashed potato, asparagus and carrots). For a $38 steak meal that was very satisfying.
4
This is a charming food and wine bar along Telok Ayer Street. It has an extensive wine menu and delicious French food. Truly value for money with the Amex Platinum card. Recommended!
5
Basically my second home in Singapore. As a french doing my internship here for 6 months, it is amazing to find such a good cuisine here and feel at home in the same time. Prices are affordable and staff is reaaaally friendly. Would definitely recommend!
3
Visited for lunch and decided on the set lunch which was quite attractively priced.
We ordered the grilled tuna and poached salmon main course. The tuna was quite disappointing and has driven down my rating. The salmon was well cooked.
The chocolate ganache was excellent.
5
The food is very decent for the price but the choices for desert are very limited. And they have a 2 hour timelimit for Friday dining but the serving of main course is in a bit slow.
5
Food is excellent, everything we had from starters to salad to main and desserts were super yummy.The parma ham croquettes were filled with fluffy mashed potatoes and the tangy dressing added a unique flavour to it. The crostini is a must order! Every option looked good but unfortunately we could only choose 1 as each serving has 4 pieces so we went for the burrata with tomato. No regrets there!The Shrimp and Avocado salad with pomegranate dressing is a winner too, was pleasantly surprised that the shrimps were hot!The Truffle Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta is a must try too. Shrimps were small but plentiful. The Turkey main was a Thanksgiving special and is the most tender turkey I've ever had. The Chocolate ganache cake was rich and indulgent but totally worth the calories. The lemon tarts were too sour for my liking though. While they had 2 seatings and we were supposed to leave by 830, the staff kindly let us stay a little longer till about 9 when they really needed the table back. Prices are reasonable and ambience is perfect for dates and special ocassions. Looking forward to trying the other items on their menu soon

Sadly there wasn't enough duck rillette to have as a stand-alone starter but sufficient to add to a sharing platter, which was very good with some proper cut meats unlike many establishments which offer only cheap preservative-filled varieties.My friend and I both had steaks which hit the spot - good meat and cooked nicely, with flavoursome accompaniments.We savoured wine from the dispensing unit. The cost does rather add up, especially with a tiny tasting portion, but it's nice to try a few different wines
4
The place was cozy and you place your orders and get your bill via the iPad. Had the truffle shrimp pasta which was delicious. Highly recommend this dish. We also had the pork ribs which was a little sweet for us. It was served with mash potato but I got them to change it to wedges which was one of the best wedges I've ever had. Prices are a little high consider the portion. So I will only go there again if I'm using the entertainer app :
5
This is the perfect eatery to kick back with a glass of wine (their house wine), or a glass of rose when you are craving french food. It is well-priced two course meal for $23++. Napoleon was definitely a culinary hit than miss. Be sure to check this restaurant out when you are in Singapore's CBD. No regrets, I promise

Restaurant Week at Napoleon surprised me! For a place that didn't have the extra cost ('cos of the restaurant week star), the food was pretty dang delicious.The appetiser of Baked Bone Marrow caught my eye; I knew I had to order it. The cubes of honey baked ham on top were generous, but I didn't feel they were actually necessary. But mmm aahhh yessss the bone marrow itself went super well with the warm Sourdough Toast served alongside it. The main courses of Honey BBQ Pork Ribs & Mushroom Risotto were perfect to share between us. I love the risotto for its creaminess, perfectly done grains.. & it's richness. But even though the portion isn't massive, it is very jelat with all the cheesiness inside. Can't imagine finishing it in my own. & I wish there were more ingredients (e.g. more of the big plump juicy mushrooms!!) The Honey BBQ Pork Ribs were nicely glazed & tender. Though they weren't fall-off-the-bone, they did separate easily from the bone so that's good enough. The potato mash was also creamy & thick like a good mash should be.The desserts were hit & miss. LOVED the Duo of Lemon Tartelet - difficult to cut through especially with a dessert spoon, but once the tartness of the lemon (oh is that a pun) fills your mouth..... Heaven! It was so good that the seemingly interesting low fat yogurt gelato paled in comparison. In fact, a little strange that a sour-ish gelato was paired with an already sour dessert. Too much together, great on its own. That, by far, was the most interesting dessert. The other option - just straight up Artisan Gelato (we chose a duo of Sea Salt Caramel & Valrhona Dark Chocolate) was just meh. The Tartelet Duo was definitely way better!  3-course Restaurant Week set meal Dinner: $38++ Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats available☀️ Al fresco seats available Accepts reservations - I used Chope & Dining City Restaurant Wee
4
Warm greeting on entering the restaurant, always nice. Appetiser was fantastic, but main course of iberico pork roast was served room temperature, would have preferred it a little warm. Good service generally though a utensil dropped by a wait staff at my table took a long time to be cleared. and only after some reminders. But kudos to Erwan who was attentive and efficient despite running a full house
4
Was here with some friends for drinks and tapas snacks. We sat outside and had a lovely drink watching all the people and cars go by. The small tapas plate of cheeses and meats were delicious.
3
Food was nice but could be even better. Service was great, indeed. Love their wine recommendations and think this is something that keeps me and my friends coming back.
4
Great decor, cosy and comfortable. Staff were friendly, attentive and helpful. Good selection of wine and well priced.
4
You can see & feel the pride in their cuisine & service, you know you are well taken care of at this place...
4
That was our farewell lunch to our colleague who is leaving. The food and service are excellent during our visit.
4
The Lamb is really good. We had the special of the month - duck breast. It would be good if there was more of it.
4
Elegant cuisine for reasonable price , plus friendly staff. Concept is innovative on menu. Book in advance if you want a table separated for two .
5
The food was excellent and the staff were really attentive to us. We ordered tomato cream soup, lobster risotto, pasta and dessert platter for 2. They were all amazing! We love the tomato soup and lobster risotto. They were simply delicious. We look forward to coming back again.
4
I visited the outlet because of the Amex Platinum dining benefits (50% for 2 pax). That made the meal very affordable - though wine prices are rather steep. We had the poached salmon and BBQ ribs - ribs could be more tender and the mash that came with the salmon less salty. I would not go back for the full-priced meal for sure but the Amex dining privilege is really quite good
2
Have been here 4 times now. First 3 times have been good. Last visit was poor. Ordered a main and after 40 mins asked where it was. Was told it hadn't been ordered. The staff member then realized their mistake and apologized. Initial reaction was that its the Customers fault though and they can do no wrong. They didn't do to much to compensate for the error despite spending $300+ on 2 bottles of wine
4
very good french food in town. Quality is food for the price you pay. I have been there several time and I have never been disappointed.
5
Came here for our anniversary celebration. Enjoy with the Amex promotion. Overall food was prepared and present in a nice setting. Will come back again.
4
had cheese platter, ribs, and shrimp pasta for dinner. good breadth of selection from appetizers, mans and dessert. delicious food and great service.
5
Great place for dinner with friends. Loved the delicious steak & foie gras dinner. Friend who ordered the lobster risotto really enjoyed the meal as well.
4
Had a lovely girls catchup sesh here over their wide and great selection of wines. Food were delicious though the portions a little small, service attentive.
5
This bar is awesomely good.. staff are really friendly and caters to all your needs.. food is affordable..
I come 3 times a week and has been coming for the past 3 years..
Highly recommended!!
Jk
4
Ingredients were very fresh! Especially the cherry tomatoes! Had the bbq pork ribs. The sauce was on point
4
It's like a different world in the restaurant in contrast with all the hustle and bustle of the road and pubs outside. It was a cozy place and they have a wide selection of wines. Food was great and pretty affordable. Highly recommended. Will be back this coming weekend for a birthday dinner.
5
Napoleon is a great and cosy place suitable for many occasions! Want to organize a corporate dinner with a couple of colleagues? Enjoy great food with your friends? Take your loved one on a date? Or simply catch up with your roommate over a glass of wine? Napoleon is the place!The staff is great, service is friendly and efficient and gives you the best advice to select your wine (As a Frenchie, I am usually difficult with that!). A large variety of food is available for small appetites or food lovers. Personally loved the Mango Avocado Tuna Tartar!Napoelon is a must try
4
Our first time trying this restaurant was very good. The atmosphere and food were delicious, we ordered the croquettes, smoked salmon bruschetta, salmon cream pasta, chicken pesto salad and dessert platter. Everything was delicious, but the pasta was overdone and not al dente. Other than that it was a delicious experience. One other thing we noticed, we had to ask for the cheque 3 different times because they kept forgetting to bring it over. This resulted in a wait for about 30 minutes for our cheque.
5
Nice restaurant with very tasty food (and dessert! Really enjoy the lemon tart) and I received very good advice on wine from the manager of the restaurant! Lunch menu is totally affordable. I will come back again!
3
Nice cool bar, although the outside is squeezed. Good quick service and food was fine as were beers and wines. Nice spot.
5
Waiters & waitresses were friendly and helpful. Many wine choices & food choices. Food was average IMHO , maybe i didnt know how to appreciate mixed platter. the goat cheese taste was unbearable for me but the wine was reasonable and nice.
5
Was a last minute arrangement and found this through google. Reserved a table & it was a great evening with great wine & company. Waiters & Waitresses were friendly & helpful. Was quite crowded on a Thursday evening. Do make reservations before going down.
5
Discovered this place accidentally and thoroughly enjoyed it. Ordered the steak and tuna for main courses and they are absolutely delicious. The steak was juicy and succulent and the tune was very well prepared.To top it off, the offering of the wide variety of wines from many countries and allowing tasting portion (had to pay but it is worth it), top the overall experience. Would definitely go back again to try the other main courses and more wine tasting
5
We have an amazing place in Napoleon tonight. The food is amazing and ingredients are really fresh. We appreciate the service and the assistance of Erwan, the manager. Really recommended for a French dinner/lunch in the CBD. Plus : good selection of wine for all budget
5
I go there a couple of times per month and the staff is always welcoming. The service is quick thanks to the order over iPad and the menus change often so there is always something new. They also have a great choice of wines to go with your meal.All in all, a very good place to go after work to relax with friends and colleagues and blow off some steam around a glass of wine or a beer and a good meal
5
There are many reasons to come by for a sip of good wine and a course aside ! And many more to come back to the Napoleon !I've been coming back for the last 6 months and even got to put up my own routine: a beer on a week day, a lunch set, a glass of wine on Friday evening, off to the week end.It always feels good to walk up this cozy terrace packed with people and enter the restaurant. Very nice decoration and furnitures, spend some time to look at the framed portraits. It's full of wise tips on how to live the Good Life !The self service wine machines is one of my favorite things ! It feels like pouring yourself a glass of wine at home but with the quality service on top ! Great wine concept ! Erwan and his team are always available to any question you may have on the wines and will learn you the ropes of wine making, the origin of the wines and what's inside the bottle ! A bit of jam doesn't hurt no one right !Feeling peckish ? I recommend the mixed plates, amazing cheese and charcutery from France ! Fancy for more, well go for the set of Tapas the Napoleon has on its menu, the Parma ham croquettes are delicious ! Still some room, go for the angus beef or the honey BBQ pork ribs, a meat of great quality, very tender for my greatest pleasure.The diner comes to its end? Go and have a look at the bar, Erwan will certainly wave you on a toasty note with one of his cocktails, and he does know how to use the shaker!And one you're done, well come back next time 
5
Am a regular here and would recommend it for the friendly team, welcoming guests at any hour and a French vibe that is true to its roots.The cheeses are a highlight for me, as is the wine selection. The host thoughtfully put together some great recommendations for pairings on my visit, delivering a very warm and authentic dining experience. A great evening spot to relax and enjoy. PS: Check out the potent cocktails served after hours
4
I had dined at Napoleon a fair number of times, and it always leaves me satisfied each time. All but once, I had ordered their steak tartare which tastes consistently great. Their extensive wine list is also a huge draw. Service is almost always excellent. I have been returning to Napoleon, and will certainly continue to do so
5
Fantastic
Indeed come for the wine stay for the food
Friendly staff
Good wine selection
Excellent food
3
Nice ambience, and a great place to escape from the CBD crowd for a quiet and nice lunch. The salmon was great, but would have been a little pricey if not for the Entertainer app.
5
service was welcoming, atmosphere was interesting, with a choice to try various wines at a nominal price. food was great.
5
Great food and wine. The variety of French wines to dispense made it a fun gastronomic experience. Great ambience and friendly staff too.
5
Very good food, fresh ingredients cooked just right and fancily served. The wine selection is comprehensive and the friendly staff helps you for pairing. Great time there thanks!
5
It is great to be there, wide variety of house pour. I will introduce more friends to go. Thanks for the hospitality....
3
Aircon was leaking onto a seat next to us, not ideal. Everything else was fine and the food was good, but they need to get their aircon sorted out.
3
Mains not requiring top up of $6 tasted average. Prawn arrabiata was just average. The prawns were bland and frozen and not fresh prawns. As for dessert, we ordered chocolate ganache which tasted good. The lemon tart was also good. However both desserts we ordered were very small in portions. The photo revealed a longer and larger slice of chocolate ganache but we were served less than half the portion as seen in the picture. The same applies for the lemon tart. While it had a strong lemon taste and fragrance, the tart was very small as opposed to the proportion seen in the photo.
3
I was told that the restaurant is worth visiting and it turned out to be a waste of time and effort even to make a booking. There is absolutely nothing worth visiting for since the food are no better than my maid's cooking and the place is very small (you and your neighbor will be squeezing buds if you are a bit stocky). The service is bad and the servers cannot even speak speak proper English. So, if you are happen to be at Telok Ayer and cannot find a place to eat, you can try this place (at least you will not get food poisoned)
2
Ordered Lamb and Salmon dishes. Lamb was thick and yummy but Salmon was an utter disappointment.Food was served almost 1 hour later, maybe that explains the cold dish. For it's price tag, we would expect better food served.Service was almost non-existent for our table. Maybe we did not order more dishes than the other tables. Tables around us were given refilled bread and water but not for us. Definitely not coming here again. There are far better food along the same street
5
Great menu and food.
The selection of wine is TOP with hidden gems and great special imports that cannot be found in any other place in Singapore.
Don't miss Erwan, great host!!
Will be back
5
We went there for a friend birthday and I have to say that everything was perfect from starter to dessert! Product of good quality in generous portions. Just delicious. We ll definitely come back!
4
Nice ambience with reasonably priced set lunch. Food was good and so was the service. Good setting for any business lunches.
5
Very nice place wine is amazing and very friendly atmosphère ask for jc the owner as he is a fantastic guy. Highly recommended
4
Service was excellent, waiter/tress always asking if everything was alright. Concerning food we took a a set menu, and my favorite was the angus beef rossini, well cooked, smoked, and tender! I also liked the fusion style in the starters. Dessert was perfect
5
Been there 3 times and equally treated to the good food standard and wine selections. Will be back for more.
4
they have set lunches on week days which are value for money. we visited with a group of 8, and service was rather slow. other than that it was not ba
5
I don't do too many reviews in Singapore as I'm living here and don't necessarily take the time to write about places. However, after my first visit to Napoleon I thought it was so good I would put in a review. Too often in Singapore restaurants are too pricey, have average service, good if not great food etc. but this place nailed it with great service from start to finish, an excellent location and layout and one of the best meals I've eaten in Singapore (the lamb in case you're wondering). It wasn't too pricey either and I would say is much less than the benchmark for that location, that quality and that service here. Hopefully my first visit will be the first of many
4
I was expecting more of a wine bar feel but it comes across more set up for food.The food itself was pretty good, my lamb was tasty and I really liked it that mash accompanies the meat rather than the ubiquitous fries. The menu was smaller and had less variety than I thought it may. Our duck and pork rillettes starter was spot on.The wine selection is mainly by the self-service (though staff seemed to be helping some diners) from a 32 wine selection from an automated pouring machine. We enjoyed this, but I was surprised that the selection by the bottle was less extensive. It becomes very expensive quickly too
4
Wide selection of wine at very reasonable prices. Interior is slightly dark, a little loud and may not suit intimate conversations. We sat by the road and enjoyed people watching. For food, had crocette, burratta appetiser, shrimp pasta, tuna mains and dessert platter. All were above expectations except pasta which was overcooked. Service was excellent, prompt and flexible (we were able to return an order of Evian when we realised we can have free water instead - do ask since it's not available on the ipad menu
4
The portions were decent and service was attentive. Good place for a business lunch or a casual lunch. Price is comparable with all the other restaurants along the stretch of Telok Ayer Street.
4
Love the tenderloin and risotto. The bread as appetiser was very hard though. Nice environment. Tried profiteroles and it's very nice.
5
Food is good
I cannot stop slurping the tomato soup
Service is excellent
My n-th visit here , helps that it's near my office
Coming back again of cos
4
The food was simply awesome, especially the bone marrow and the steak. Dessert was very good too. It was just a little too noisy for conversation with the music turned up too loudly. It is conveniently located just a short walk from the Telok Ayer MRT station
2
I had been to this place several times, and will bring friends n guest to this place for dinner as I love the food and the wine selections they have. On a Friday in March 2017, I made a reservation for dinner and was "reminded" by the restaurant that we have to stick to a timeframe for the reservation. I had made a reservation at 6:30pm and told the person to hold the table as the restaurant is located in CBD area and parking is a big issue in the area. While 2hrs is in fact enough time for us to eat, but we come here also because of the wines. I had ask the person on the phone assuming they serve efficiently and we are still having our bottles of wine, are you going to chase us out or change our table? the person replied saying we will make sure you finish by the timeframe. With this I was a taken aback as I was reminded of a timeframe to finish our dinner and drinks. On the actual day we had our dinner only as I had verbally advertised to my friends about the tasty food and wine before the booking, and we refused to order the wines and had told my friends that we only have 2 hrs for dinner.. so we decided to go elsewhere for wines as not to stop them for the next reservations. Perhaps this is the standard of service in restaurants nowadays, it is very unpleasant to make your customers eat with a timeframe
4
Went with a colleague for a quick lunch. Food was well presented and tasty. Would definitely come back again. Price wise was on point.
4
Nice food and good wine.. a bit cramped inside the restaurant... the rest are all just good, service to be improved
4
The foods was nice, had a pleasant evening with friends. Staffs were helpful too. found the place a bit small but with nice foods, it ok
5
Downtow Singapore in one the remaining charming old street of Singapore, this restaurant where people speak French serve good food at very affordable price. A place very good for lunch or drink wine with friends
5
Came here for dinner with mom because it's on the survival chic card (30% discount) and mom wanted french food. We had bone marrow with toast, lobster risotto and lemon meringue tars and ice cream for dessert. The food was amazing, every bit of it. And I love technology... at Napolean you don't have to wave down the servers for anything. You can order with an ipad tucked away behind you in the seat and your order goes directly to the kitchen. The bill also comes with the press of a button, or a tap on the ipad. It's so efficient.
5
It was an awesome time dining here, food was prepared well and plating was creative and artistic. Definitely coming back again! Thanks!
5
The food was pretty decent and the service was excellent! Staff were very attentive and polite. Really loved the ambience of the place as well!
5
excellent experience, great environment, nice good and service, wonderful wine suggested by the restaurant
4
Great food here, the lamb shank and angus beef were really enjoyable, tender and melts in your mouth. Paired with their wines, an absolute treat. Nice atmosphere to go with the food. Satisfying night out!
4
Nice good and highly recommend the bone marrow toast, beef tenderloin medium rare. Skip the foie gras though. Small place so make your reservations for big groups of 6 and more.
4
The service was impeccable from start to finish.
Many wines to try by the glass, thankfully available in half portions.
The food was good.
5
My husband and I dined here, sharing a bottle of wine, lovely starters and delicious mains. I would certainly recommend as a great option for dinner.
4
Didn't book a table we were pleased on a Saturday night to eat here .We enjoyed salmon and Tuna mains, refined sophisticated food enough to satisfy a small appetite. Atmosphere fine dining without the need to over dress, lots of French speaking patrons. Price was reasonable extensive wine list
5
It has been awhile since I last visited. And to my surprise the menu had a few changes. The food came out really slow as understandably the place was packed. We were taken cared by the manager herself. She was lovely. Made the wait all worthwhile. And it did! The pork ribs and and angus steak was mouthwatering! A must try.
3
A casual meet up with a friend who suggested this resto. Perhaps I should have ordered something else for starter, but not too impressed with the Burratta Mozzarella Platter with parma ham. I have had better Burratta elsewhere and the portion could be a little more. The grilled Angus beef tenderloin was mediocre, and no one asked us how we would like our beef done. Again, I've had better. The saving grace was the Chocolate Ganache for dessert
5
the experience was miles better than expectation. the meals were served in a timely manner where the kitchen will only prepare the next course upon us finishing the current.
5
The restaurant has good atmosphere and the food was good. Wide range of wine selection, nice place for a date
3
The beef tartare was good but the lamb shank was expensive for its serving size though I didn't try it to see if it's nice. As for service, I think 1 from Phillipines & the other from an Asian country is much better & plseant than the 2 European staff.Wines are pricy for this outlet
4
I had the Chope Exclusive Jan 2017 3 course Set Lunch.Starter - QUINOA CHICKEN SALAD-Nice Flavour, but the Quinoa grains were a bit hard to scoop up with the fork. Mains - SAUTEED ANGUS BEEF TENDERLOIN, mashed potatoes,caramelized onions, carrots, chili & shimejimushrooms - The beef cubes were melt in your mouth. Only 1 was a bit hard & chewy. Excellent Dish !Dessert - CHOCOLATE GANACHE artisan vanilla gelato & coffee crumble - I swopped the vanilla for the Valrhona dark chocolate gelato. A totally heavenly dessert. I almost licked the plate. Coffee - dark and strong. Great finish for a wonderful meal.I cannot wait to return to try their other dishes
4
It's the 2nd time i've been here and the food doesnt disappoint. Ordered the cold cuts platter which included duck rilette (loves!) and mozarella burrata salad which is sooooo good! And the truffle angelhair pasta! Yums
2
Food was pretty good. Wine too.Sadly service from the male server was poor. This is my first restaurant review as I never liked to express opinions on social platforms. For a relatively high class restaurant like that it was quite unbelievable.At first he was pretty nice explaining how the wine tasting works there. But that was where it ended.When we asked about the types of cheese there were, you could sense he was stretching his patience.At the end when we wanted to use Entertainer 1-for-1 vouchers, he insisted we could only utilise multiple vouchers from one individual. We were puzzled because having been Entertainer users for many years, we could always use different people's vouchers as long as we used up to the capped number of vouchers (half the number of people in small groups). Admittedly we took other restaurants' generosity as an expectation - It wasn't the case that we could use different people's vouchers but only from one individual. This was entirely our mistake.But this dude was extremely rude when we wanted to clarify. We simply wanted to understand whether it was napoleons rules or Entertainer's rule. He was dismissive and expressed frustration when we were genuinely and politely asking for clarification. Sadly that patronising and fake smile is imprinted in my mind.So unfortunate. Would have totally recommended my friends to go

Great place to come for after office drinks and a meal. Food is good although portions are not generous. Rather noisy inside the restaurant, but cosy enough for couples and small groups. Service staff seem competent but look stressed most times.
4
Visited this restaurant a couple of times. The truffle angel hair shrimp pasta is great. Will go back to try the other dishes
4
Came here for a Xmas dinner with my colleague armed with the Entertainer 1-4-1 promotion and was really pleasantly surprised.My title sums up my experience really. The ambience was really nice and cosy (perfect for a date I think!), the service was attentive, and the dishes were mostly good. Would definitely come here again!
4
I dined here on NYE and had the Christmas/NYE set menu. Staff were very friendly and the restaurant had a nice atmosphere. This was complimented by lovely food
3
We ate a chef's set lunch that was not bad, but we should have taken the express set lunch. to be honest the salad was pretty basic and simple, and the food is pretty basic. nothing special
5
Held our christmas party here for 30 people. The service was great. Chef Andrew choose a great menu for the party. Food was a good portion with fresh ingredients.
Great wine selection as well! Would definitely recommend this place to everyone!
5
The food and service were outstanding, as was the wine presentation and subsequent tasting. Will definitely come back.

I went because they emailed me about the promotion which offers free oysters for every bottle of sparkling rose ordered. And I brought a friend who loves oysters and sparkling wines. When I got there, they said the promotion was already over a few months ago and their marketing team made a mistake in including it in their email newsletter. The staff could not do anything to recover the service as they aren't empowered to. Why couldn't they just send out another email to all in their mailing list to inform us of the mistake in the marketing newsletter? It was my third visit to Napoleon. And quality of food went down. I don't think i will visit Napoleon again or recommend this place to anyone.
5
Dinner at 9.30 pm seems like you are in Spain, Italy or France where most Singapore restaurants are going to take your last order. Napoleon is a chic bar. The service by the French crew was superb. Wine list even more so with many not on the menu. I enjoyed the tablet ordering so you can focus on chatting with the service crew.... better if you can speak French! A modern chic ambience with delicious food without putting a dent in your pocket. Thank you JC for a great night
5
Food quality was good, especially the lobster risotto and truffle shrimp angel hair. The staffs are all polite and friendly, they have been recommending very good wines which fits into our dishes. And this is a cozy and warm place which is suitable for gathering or after work chill out. We had great time there
1
Unfortunately for us, when we reached the restaurant for our 8:30 reservation (it was that late given that I was told that only the 2nd seating is available), there were no seats available for us. When you have waited til 8:30 to have dinner and you're hungry and you're anticipating to have a good dinner and this happens - disaster is bound my way. I called the restaurant to arrange a reservation and was confirmed for 8:30. When we reach there, the servers sheepishly smiled at us as there were no tables available for us. As we have spoken to the manager, there was nothing that he could do mainly because the group prior to us had still ordered desserts at 8:30pm. What I would have expected would be for the restaurant to have mentioned to the group prior that there's a 2nd seating and they should be done by 8:30pm. I asked the assistant manager if that was advised to the group, and he said no. I asked how come it was mentioned, and he just mentioned to me that he's simply busy. I expected much more from the management given they have seating times, and based on how this was dealt and managed with, it wasn't effective at all. We were told in the end if we could wait for 20-30 more minutes for the group prior to us to finish their desserts. What if they haven't finished eating yet, would he have told them that the 2nd seating group is already here? In the end, we just left the restaurant because we were like nuisance in the middle of the restaurants no where to be seated
5
While the place was busy as it was Friday lunch we did manage to secure a table for fiveThe Chefs set lunch at $22 great valueThree choice of starters and 5 choices of mainsThe Prawn salad was a favourite pickThe mains were the hihlight, Truffle Prawns very good, the beef disdh well received as well as the lamb shankWill definetly be back!keep up the good wor

3rd time at Napoleon and always a great experience. Great selection of French wines that you can order by the glass and in tasting portions. The place is cosy and offers outdoor seating. Food is really good. Good bread, cheese and amazing lobster risotto. Place is great with friends or romantic or for after work drinks. Will definitely go back.
5
One of my favorite place for food and wine in Singapore ! I have done several visits to Napoleon and it has always been a pure enjoyment. I love the quality of their food, always super tasty with French inspiration. Additionally, their selection of wine is amazing with plenty of option by the glass. On top of that, service is great and friendly and price remain quite reasonable for the quality you have.Definitely a perfect place to go to enjoy !Ps : their steak tartare is simply amazing and the bread and butter are sooooo gooddd 
4
Staff was friendly and helpful
Tasty foods and drink and not forgetting their wine
Absolutely worth it
Will definitely drop by again
4
Great Food and friendly staffs, I will definately recommend my working colleagues and friends for next meet up.
4
Good food and excellent service. Ipad ordering is a little weird but functional but takes away the personal touch. Wait staff were excellent with suggestions when asked.
4
The food is good and service staff are generally polite. But because of the tight small space in the restaurant, there is no privacy at all. The restaurant tried to accommodate most diners, but it became a situation where tables are so close to each other that you can hear each other's conversations and chairs are back to back - such that each time someone gets up, you need to get up and move to let him/her pass through - and this is very disruptive to your dining experience. Sometimes, the servers - in order not to disturb the diners - try to squeeze through the small space in between the chairs, and that can be disruptive too. Apart from the tight space, food was generally good and of quality.
4
Don't expect super good food at a wine bar but not too bad. Stick to the cold cuts and cheese appetisers. The dessert is a disaster. Good range of wine by the glass. Not too bad but the somm didn't really help much in terms of expertise and recommendation. Good value for money though
3
Napoleon offers a couple of dozen wines in dispensers that allow you to buy a taste, a half glass, or a full glass. Very good for educating your palate.Prices are Singapore-expensive, unfortunately, so don't expect this to be anywhere near cheap
4
Food can be served faster as we waited quite a while for the food to be served. Staff was friendly. I made advance booking but were seated outside the washroom.
2
We went there with a group of friends. We were looking forward to it and had expected it to be a higher tier restaurant since it was part of Palate Dining Program. But we were disappointed; particular, by the ambience. Cigarette smell from smokers outside the restaurant entrance came into the inside of the restaurant, which we informed the waiter about but not much could be done about it
2
Service not good. Food average at best. Portion size does not justify price. Ambience from a personal opinion not conducive for a cozy night of romance. Location was goo
4
Was there in a group of 6 for birthday dinner.Great food & service. Unfortunately the AC was down and we had our sweat dripping while having our steak. Staff apologize about the faulty AC. Apart from that, there is nothing done. Paying for an awful experience, I say.Napkin wasn't clean, it came with an odour.Great food & service after all.
2
service with an attitude because we arrived earlier than our supposed reservation time, and we were literally standing at the wine drafts for like more than 5 mins because we did not know how to operate it and NOONE CAME TO HELP US.
4
Was there with the girls for birthday celebration. Food is great. Love the cozy setting as well. It's a popular spot for after work chilled drinks too :)
4
We did not do the small wine tasting, as we were a group of 5, we just ordered bottles. all the wines we ordered were personal preferences so nothing to complain about there. Actually there wasnt anything to complain about anyway. Food was very good, we had the angel hair pasta ( I couldnt taste that as I have a food intolerance) and beef tartare, the cheese platter and the crostinis. all really good
4
We have been here last night after a false start with another restaurant. This has been my third time at this place. Wines are reasonably priced and superb. You can get good to great French wines between 100 to 150$ which is reasonable for Singapore market. Food was delicious too
2
Reading through the glowing reviews..I was expecting a little more. Firstly the lamb shanks we wanted to order at 8pm were sold out. This has happened to us more often than not in Singapore, which raises a red flag for me. Because it portrays lack of care to me. We ordered three entrees, two were fine but the truffle fries.....were they reheated in the microwave? The wine is ridiculously expensive, and a very small portion. I do realise that this is more for tasting but seriously! I also ask a question to management 'does the chef use MSG'? I could not sleep the night we dined with you and that usually comes with MSG being added to the food.
4
I dined at Napoleon a week ago with friends and had a great experience. The service was friendly and thoughtful, we were initially seated at a large table near the bathroom but just as we sat down one of the servers approached and let us know a much nicer and more private table had opened up due to a cancellation and offered to move us there, which we thought was very kind! We also liked the iPad, which allowed us to see pics of the food for a better idea of what we were ordering. The food was fantastic, the goat cheese and chorizo salad a nice combination of flavours and my main, the lamb shank parmentier, was delicious. The lamb was incredibly tender and the flavours were perfectly balanced. The chocolate duo I had for dessert was divine, especially the soft and gooey chocolate canele; my only complaint would be that it was a bit too small, I ended up wanting more! Overall a great experience, a lovely atmosphere with yummy food and good value as far as quality for price. I'll be visiting again

We went during a French restaurant week, we had decided to choose this restaurant over the others because of the French Week Menu presented. We wanted something interesting for the 3 Course dinner, such as Angus beef and Foie gras. Our favourite was the Appetizer - La Samaine Francaise ( Homemade Grand Marnier Foie gras terrine), The Mains - Sauteed Angus Beef Tenderoin and Tuna steak. Other then the favourful food we had to satisfied us, we also enjoyed the Wine experience. Great selections of French wines list they have here. We couldnt decide which to have, I was introduced to a brilliant idea by the male Manager ( sorry I didnt get his name) who had provided us wonderful service. He explained that we could have our very own wine experience by using a card. All we need to do is insert the card, dispense which wine that were featured on the display, we can choose to taste it first and then decide which wine we like. Love this Hands on experience to choose our favourite taste, so we did our own wine pairing for the 3 course dinner. We enjoyed the dinner and the experience of doing our own Wine pairing. view our food post on our instagram page : bellytubby #bellytubb

As a group of 4 girls, we went for a good night out. We were recommended set dinner menu. We all enjoyed our starters and main course. Best truffle angle hair pasta! The dessert was not that interesting though. Definitely enjoyed out night and looking forward to revisiting soon. Only complain was that we were seated closer to the entrance this time. With the smokers outside, we could smell the cigarette from where we were
1
food wise is very lousy nothing worth going back for, service is above average.Had the worst shrimp truffle angel hair pasta, salad tasteless too...
4
Despite a bad start due to bad seating, service improved after a change of table and server. Food is surprisingly good with a wide selection of French and other wines. The ambience is great for a Fri night out but be warned the space is tight. We were questioning if the tiny table reserved for 3 of us had space for any food after a bottle of wine n 3 glasses! After the happy hour crowd weaned off, it was more comfortable, and the staff were happy to chat and help take photos. Enjoyed the mixed platter, (3 French cheeses, iberico ham, mixed salami), tuna steak and Angus beef. Desserts were heavenly. And yes, I will be back... :
4
The pasta was, as usual, done perfectly and very delicious. Thumbs up to the chef. We really enjoyed the dishes.
1
Truth is, the general service staff are good people, nothing to rave about but certainly not turn-offish either. The female manager on the other hand is highly aggressive - when we tried to purchase another bottle of wine in hopes of keeping the table which admittedly was reserved for another party (but whom didn't seem to kick up a fuss when they showed up), she went nuts on us, accusing us of not wanting to settle the initial bill. Very bizarre. That one incident has put me off ever patronizing this hole in the wall, and their wine prices aren't cheap
4
The food at napoleon was great! Waitress was also good at providing us with quality service. However, the place had a strong smoke smell, not sure if its due to haze though.
5
Casual and friendly ambiance in a super nice decor, service is good and efficient.The food is delicious, authentic, fresh and very good quality products. Wide selection of excellent french wines "by the glass" and Champagne at very affordable prices.Loved this place, will return soon and will recommend it with no doubt
4
Ambience = cozxyService = friendly and knowledgeableFood = portion is very generous and of course is nice, but if the shrimp angel hair can be slightly dryer will be betterWine = they have quite a variety of wine, you can choose to order tasting, half or normal portionAdvice to make reservation in advance because the restaurant was not very bi
3
I placed my order at 7.30pm and waited for 45 minutes for my food to arrive on a Friday evening. Service was slow but food was of decent quality with reasonable prices
3
We arrived early before the happy hour and had set lunches and 2 glasses of wine each. The wine was great. Food portion was quite sad, especially the prawn pomelo salad which was not very tasty. The wine was good though. And when happy hour starts, I was surprised to know that Wine is not included in the happy hour considering the fact that this is a wine bar.
3
This is a very popular venue for lunch, not surprisingly given the express lunch (pasta plus some ice cream) is only $15++. The downside is that because there are so many people the service can be quite slow. But the staff seem really friendly. I'd certainly come back, but maybe earlier in the week when it's less busy
1
Took 30 minutes to get a simple starter, then got the order wrong. Waitress threw breadcrumbs over me and didn't apologise. Then another wait for the food... Had to go inside to ask for it, but got the bill instead, whilst we hadn't even had our mains yet. Never coming back here
5
Excellent choice of wine by the glass. The list is almost endless when you are dining alone and can't do a bottle. The service was very good and everyone always smiled. For dinner had angel hair pasta with shrimps and truffle- not the best but the wine made up for everything.Will I go back again- yes. For sure
5
I particularly liked the beef tartare and the chicken ballotine. The carrot purée is a must. The selection of wine and champagne is very good. I love the Bordeaux pauillac bellegrave, so difficult to find a pauillac Below 100$ in Singapore restaurants. Greatly recommended
4
Friendly staff, good food, great wine collection! Recommended for a relaxing diner. Try the lobster risotto!
5
Great food and dessert, lobster rissotto and beef were tasty. Also tried the desserts for 2 which looked pretty and tasted nice too!
4
Loved the ambience- low key and played our favourite tunes! Service was friendly and prompt. We had pasta, which was slightly expensive, but went well with the bottle of white wine we had ordered.
4
Food and service was good. I ordered a cider and told server I don't like the taste. He came back later with a glass of white wine. This is what good service is. Will be booking for next week with different friends
5
Food was great. We thought the place wasn't going to be full as we were early but at 12.30, the place was 90% full. Advice to book in advance. Food was great. Presentation of the food was lovely. We ordered the $22++ set lunch. The main course was served a rather slowly (about 20 minutes) but they served us some bread in the mean time. Overall, great experience and will return!
5
Dined in last Tuesday June 21st with some of my colleagues. It was lunch time and there was a lot of people that day. Almost backed out since I know we might not be accommodated due to the large crowd. However, this big, friendly chubby guy ( i think was the manager) confidently invited us in and gave us a nice place to sit. He asked for our orders and was very kind and prompt with his service. He was attending to the other tables as well, and they actually seem to know him and must be regulars. I was expecting a long wait but lo and behold it really didn't really take so much time. And mind you the food was great. We would have tried the wine bar there as he explained a great selection of wine and described each with mastery. But we were only there for lunch that time and I'm only in Singapore for a short business trip. But I swear my colleagues will be going back there really soon. Kudos to the great dining experience we had and to the guy manager who attended to us. So professional. That's what I call 110% service. No wonder the place was packed. They handle large groups very well. Will truly recommend to my other colleagues when they go for business trip
3
Went there for an anniversary dinner, started out well, with good service. Good was delicious, however we had the beef carpaccio appetizer with capers which caused both of us to have upset stomachs the following day. Could have been a sensitivity to the carpaccio.Would go back again to try
4
Napoleon is a great place for chilling out in small groups or even in a large group.food was good and well worth the price given the 1 for 1 on the entertainer app.I liked the wine selection though was disappointed that 2 out of 3 wines we asked for were out of stock
5
I had a lunch at NapolÃ©on Food & Wine Bar. To be honest, the food was fantastic and very affordable for that quality ! The staff was also very friendly and professional. Regarding the wine selection, you can chose your wine among a selection of more than 30 wines by the glass at a very decent price ! Such a nice surprise for wine lovers !Thumbs up 
5
Every single dish was prepared with care and generously laced with ingredients. The service was also prompt considering a few groups having lunch in the restaurant. Will definitely be back!
5
Not going to lie, the steak here is amazing. Wonderful place, great services, they take the entertainer voucher too! Bottles of wine go for $50. Relaxed atmosphere, easy location to get to, book in advance so it's popular.

Food was delicious & had a lovely display, especially the chocolate dessert :) Love the cosy setting of the restaurant too!
3
Couldn't find parking and circled around a few times before finally parking further away and taking a walk. When I arrived they said I was late and had given my table away. Put me at a table by the entrance, which was hot and full of cigarette smoke from outside. Although the food was decent, the experience was not good
4
booked in for a group of 10. first time at napoleon, the food was good and of a decent variety.of course there's a nice selection of wines though a couple of wines are out of stock which was a little disappointing. used the entertainer app to get one for one on mains and the meal, which was great.top mains: truffle shrimp angel's hair, seared tuna, lamb shank. the rest of the mains were decent enough. i'd recommend the chicken breast crostini as well.
5
The first time that I went there we had some cold dishes with wine and to be honest, it didn't make any impression on me at all. Usually I don't go back to a place that don't impress me but I was looking for a wine bar so I decide to give it a try again and I must say their hot food certainly stole my heart away. Love not just like their beef cube with potato, Angel hair pasta!!! These 2 dishes are my all time favourite. I tried their some foods before which are also nice but the above 2 dishes simply stole my heart away and always lure me to go back for more. Overall very nice service as well. The lady manager is always very warm and attentive. Always feel warm going there after a stressful day.Wine can be a bit pricey so always feel like burning a big hole after going there. The food is definitely worth it but I will try to be careful with wine selection
5
Called ahead on a Friday night and although very busy we got a table. Service was excellent. They have iPad menus so ordering drinks and food is simple as a click (same when getting the bill you use the iPad - outstanding!) Menu is simple and the food at a high standard. Tried the Angus Beef Tartare which was probably the best I've ever had. They do wines by the glass but we had champagne will try the other wines next time. It can get busy but the atmosphere, food and ordering via iPad etc. is first rate
3
Starters were served very quickly but the main took almost an hour. By the time it got to dessert we were out of time as it was not supposed to be a long lunch being a workday. We ordered the shrimps truffle angel hair (I always do) and find this round tad too salty. Waitress was kind enough to bring us a bread basket while waiting for the main to be served (think she saw my pregnant friend). We were seated near the door (which was opened throughout the whole time) so the guests who were smoking outside may have created a lot of smoke which flowed into the restaurant and my pregnant friend got very uncomfortable. We were waiting for the dessert to take away but still thumbs down for that. Overall experience was so-so. May or may not return after this
5
We held a farewell party at Napoleon on Friday. Prefect chillax ambience, great drinks & wine and finger food! We had a medium sized crowd (more than 25) and this private reservation situated us at the back of the restaurant. Service from the team was very pleasant and professional - we felt very welcomed. When I return to office on Monday, the attendees were sharing with me how much they enjoyed themselves that evening. I highly recommend to Napoleon
5
I received an AMEX voucher for Napoleon Food and Wine Bar and my husband and I decided to try it out this past Saturday. Reservation was seamless with Chope app and we arrived to find a very quaint and pleasant restaurant. The service staff was courteous and explained the iPad ordering system,. Very slick and eliminates having to wave down service staff. The wine and food were delicious - my husband had the best tenderloin and I had tuna steak made to perfection. We will definitely be back! Thank you
5
Loved the vibe and atmosphere in napoleon. Great food and quality of wines.
Their concept "one wine one winemaker" is great as we can see videos of the winemaker explaining his own wine on their iPad menu ordering system. This is a great innovation.
4
Been there twice. Good food and environment. But it took ages to serve a dish - dont go if you are in a rush.
5
Great relaxed atmosphere with a really cool concept, great menu and really really tasty food. We had the stuffed chicken and steak gratin, both had so many amazing flavors. A must in Singapore!!!
4
Attentive and friendly service. When we asked for asked for our tuna steak to be cooked for a longer time, the crew did not hesitate to oblige. Desserts were awesome too!!! Vanilla bean ice cream which accompanied the apple crumble was perfection. Just a tad on the food. Puree which came with my salmon was not to my liking. Would be nice if there were more individual tables too. Couldn't help but be distracted by the conversations going on amongst those next to us at which table we're sharing.
1
I came to Napoleon for dinner after a recommendation from a friend who had previously dined there with the entertainer app. We came in a group of 3, upon arrival we checked with the staff regarding the usage of the entertainer app, 2 waitresses explained to us that 2 people can use 1 app, as we were in a group of 3, we clearly stated to split the 3rd bill; the waitresses agreed. The food was decent and came out fairly promptly. However, they ran out of a wine I ordered. When the bill came we noticed the restaurant had charged for the wine which ran out and did not split the bill. We requested to take the wine off and to split the bill. Maria the manager rudely explained we couldn't split the bill as we were using the entertainer app. I understand terms and conditions of using an app and was ok to agree with it, however her attitude was disgraceful especially working in a hospitality industry, she then added a comment that we were the only client she ever had a problem with. She continued to argue with us claiming the waitresses at the start of the night had left and she would not have agreed to split the bill. My friends (previous repeat customers) and I will never come back to this place purely because of the management's attitude. It's a shame about the management's attitude as the food was decent. This situation could have been dealt with smoothly without Maria's extremely poor people skills
4
lunch deal was affordable and delicious, ambience was nice, and the service staff are really good and friendly which is hard to find in singapore (one of the male service staff was very attentive and sweet). will be back
4
We were a table of 10 friends celebrating a birthday. The food was very good and well priced. We enjoyed greatly the burrata crostini, lobster bisque, the hand cut angus beef tartare and truffled angel hair with shrimp. The sampler wine machine was good fun. We sampled a variety of wines before each getting a glass of our favorite bottle. Given our large party size and that orders were sent as and when people showed up or felt like ordering more, it would have been a much better experience if we had a printout of what was ordered as an IT inept friend did not manage to successfully navigate the ipad ordering system (due to the multiple submit stages). Otherwise, a great place to go for a great value for money meal.
5
We loved the atmosphere, really chilled vibe.Wine was great, liked to iPad ordering system. Starters, we took the croquettes and burrata bruschetta....both were very tasty especially the balls.Steak was cooked perfectly and was gone in seconds!! My bf got the chicken which was so tasty! Will be back next time we come toSingapore.
2
It is quite obvious that waitress serving us was untrained, less patience and not enthusiastic with her job. We were there using the American Express palate dining privilege on a Saturday, we were told the promotion can only be used for 4 person. Having to tried so many places in Singapore on a Saturday just the two of us, naturally we questioned further. We were passed a print out to read the T&Cs by ourselves, which I thought as a service staff she could have done better. We ordered drinks while considering to stayed back if the food on the menu appeal to us, but she went ahead to keep the cutlery on the table (without asking). Lucky for us, the food menu does not intrigued us. So we moved on to other restaurant after our drinks. I would say that this place has a nice selection of drinks with good ambience, but that's all it has to offe
3
We enjoyed the food a lot. Nice portions, good presentation. The wines however were available by half (75 ml or whole glass 150ml). We took a whole glass and I have never seen such meagre pourings. At the price of the wines it makes for a hefty bill (no hapoy hour either). So even though we enjoyed it we will not be coming back.
5
Had a seat near entrance and was annoyed with smoke coming in cos door was not closed. Waitress help to offer to closed 1 side of door which was helpful.
5
Fantastic food with superb service and atmosphere
This is our 3rd night in a row so that says it all... absolutely love this place!!
5
It's like home away from home... I love the ambience and the friendliness of the staff... Superb food and wine...
4
Value for money. The grilled beef was delicious and the crostini were awesome as well. Selection of wine was extensive and price was pretty reasonable. Definitely coming here again!
4
Restaurant cum bar was packed to brim on Friday evening! Table assigned was literally sharing next to another group, felt a little uncomfortable. However dinner was saved by scrumptious food which didn't disappoint. Had grilled beef tenderloin (S$32) alongside lobster bisque soup (S$13) and prawn/pomelo salad (S$19) and all were wonderful. Kudos to the Chef and team.Service was friendly and swift though I think the wait staffs were exhausted throughout evening
1
Was looking forward to dining here. Unfortunately the service for food fell short. We had the mixed platter and burata salad to start with. No wow factor there. The burata was cold and you couldn't really taste it. Mains we had the steak tartare and poached salmon - sorry to say that both dishes were bland, wedges were stale rather than crispy, salmon portion was small and presentation was rather unappetising. Food was slow to come out. Overall experience were quite underwhelming. Can't believe that it was rated quite high on foursquare. Maybe we just went on a bad night.
5
Its hard to say what I love the most in this place!If it is the warm and cosy atmosphere you feel the minute you come in; the unique and wide selection of French Grands crus by the glass; or the smiley and attentive staff who make you feel like home. Overall, you cannot miss the great and intimate vibes of this restaurant; and whether you are here for a romantic date, or a dinner with friends, Napoleon will always surprise you. They even have a monthly oyster night with champagne, lovely!And last week they introduced me to this freshly arrived 100% natural cider called Appie to start the night.. absolutely delicious! Don't waste any more time, it's simply the best restaurant in Singapore!Oh.. and that is without mentioning their tartare is phenomenal..
5
We went there last restaurant week and we had a really great time. Went back last night and to our surprise its their monthly Oyster night and it was fantastic! We had 3 different type of oysters that came for free with each purchase of champagne or rose bottle! I am a seafood lover and this was truly a delicious experience for me and my friends. Its was packed but service was great! I found my favorite place!
3
No complaints on the food but service wise, not great. We asked for desert to be served and after 20mins, it still did not come. The next table asked for their desert to be served and theirs came before ours (and we were all having the same desert).
4
Tried Napoleon during Restaurant week March this year and the 3-course meal was good for the discounted price. Tuna Avocado Tartare and Lobster Bisque for starters were good, parmesan chips for tartare was soggy though; desserts were great. SautÃ©ed Angus Beef for mains was too spicy. Wasn't written in the menu it's gonna be that spicy. Restaurant space is a little tight, difficult to have proper conversation
5
It was a great night.. The moment you enter their outlet you will be welcome by their friendly staff... Food and wine selections are superb... Will definitely come back again and suggest your place to my friends...
4
Food is good, nice ambience
We had a good time in the restaurant as the food is well prepared especially the beef is very tender. The dessert is tasty too :) loving the time and service given to us :) very personalize
5
Excellent dishes and gelato !
Be sure to wait a little longer during peak lunch hour however worth the wait!
Price is reasonable as well for quality food!
3
For the price ..its really worth it.Mints walk from Mrt and good location.
Food was ok not that fantastic but good wine list
5
Very nice dinner and the selection of wine is very large. You can accommodate every meal with a different glass of wine. Staff was very friendly and helpful in helping you choose the wine that you may like.
Greatly recommended
4
The place is quite hip, with a large bar area near the front, as well as a dining area at the back near the show kitchen.Waitstaff are friendly, warm and efficient. Food portions were okay to generous, and the be f dish was very good. In fact, everything from the starters to the main courses were tasty, though we did find the desserts to be sweet

We celebrated a friends birthday yesterday at Napoleon. The food is delicious ! The wine selection is good. The bet part is they allow you to taste the wine and pay a small price for same. This allows us to try most wines and order the appropriate wine by the glass or by bottle.The ambience is chilled.The reason for 4 stars - poor air-conditioning. I was melting ! The staff is TOP quality. Awesome service!

This was actually one of our better experiences this week and the staff were warm and friendly, and ordering was easy via the Ipads.Foodwise, most of the dishes hit the spot. My wife had the Lobster bisque, which was tasty. I had the Angus beef carpaccio, which was okay though id did taste heavy. I loved the sauteed Angus beef tenderloin, which was cooked well and was flavourful. The chilli had a good kick, and it was somehow reminiscent of beef hor fun. The other main dish was shrimps truffle angel hair, which my wife liked. The pasta was delicious and we finished the plate. Desserts were not bad. The lemon tart brulee was not too tart, though the base was too hard and hard to break even with a knife. That did not distract fom the taste though, and the rasberries and sliced grapes added to the sweetness as a counterpoint. The chocolate canele was not too sweet and quite tasty too.It did get noisy and it was difficult to leave after dinner as there were groups of drinkers around the bar area, but that is a small point. Parking out front can be hard to find so do arrive a little earlier if you are driving. We managed to find parking further up the road past the Amoy Street Hawker Centre.If you can, would recommend you drop by to try their food

I visited this place recently and I am glad to have found this place! It is a cozy, fine dining restaurant. A great collection of wine. I had the poached salmon which was probably one of the best salmon I have eaten in Singapore. The lobster risotto was love at first bite. The truffle potatoes are also a must try. If you enjoy a good meal with great wine, this is the place to dine
5
Had 2 Steak Tartares and a meat platter for 1. Pretty good value on the Steak Tartare-alot of meat for the price ($30). Ambience was good though acoustics weren't very good.Service was good overall, though the long waiting time to get the bill (when the restaurant wasn't crowded and 2 staff were at the counter debriefing each other despite seeing me call for the bill) prompted me to knock the service rating down a notch. I wouldve given it a 3.5
5
We had a wonderful time at this place with my husband. Great foot and friendly staff.
I will definitively comme again. Great wine to try
5
I went several times. Always perfect for food and wine on a warmful atmosphere!!!
Turkey, tuna, noodles are very good!
The machine to test the wine is amazing !!!
5
We had a great time. The setting is nice and very friendly servers. Good place to keep.
They suggested a great bottle of wine
5
A great place for lunch, dinner, and drinks. Service is always very warm and professional. I've been to Napoleon many times and I definitely recommend this place for everyone that loves to have good food and wine.
5
Napoleon got recommended to me by some friend as a great place to have good wine and food, and I have to say it is now a place that I am going often, for the great selection of wine, their tastefull boeuf tartare (but not only) and the superbe service that you are getting here. They will always have new wine to try and recommend so every time you come is a new experience 
5
We went to Napoleon for a team lunch, they have two types of lunch menus, chef menu: starter + main dish or express menu main dish + gelato. you can choose from salads, pasta to meat. Good value for money.I chose the express lunch of Creamy Salmon Linguine, creamy and a so much salmon, delicious!We noticed that they have a quite large range of wine, all are French wines, hadn't had time to try this time, next time
5
Gem of a French place nested in the Telok Ayer district. They have a wide selection of crostinis, traditional French food and other cheese / meat platter.Maybe the best steak tartare in town, and a fantastic choice of wine by the glass (they have special machines).Perfect for a date or a dinner with friends. I also like the staff very much. Since I know of Napoleon, I keep coming back!
5
I booked a lunch followed by wine tasting class with my team for a team building event (group of 10). Everything was great. Amazing selection of wines. Great explanations from JC and fun times with the animations prepared. Would highly recommend for team events during the day and very good option in the evening for a casual drink afterwork or a romantic dinner.
5
The place is nice and the atmosphere is really pleasant. Service is great too!The tuna was pretty good and my wife loved the shrimp (I'm allergic, so I couldn't give it a try...)!It's usually hard to find a good wine I like but the selection here is great.Be sure to try the chocolate duo too ;-)Would definitely come again
5
I've tried this place multiple times, it never failed I and my guests' expectations. Great wine selection & ambience; friendly staff; dining options are not standing-out however still good and pleasant. Overall I'd highly recommend Napoleon for a romantic night out or some casual weekday unwind over some fantastic wine
5
Saturday night dinner. Food was simply delicious; best risotto ever! Very good selection of French wines. Staff is very friendly. Requires some budget but definitely worth it.
4
Excellent place, we happened to walk pass and stayed for a bottle of wine. Very friendly and nice service, the wine list is very well Organised but only have French wine. Well selected, limited but good quality.
Definitely worth a try.....
4
A perfect little hideaway wine bar serving traditional French Fayre.. Great wine by the glass, perfect to chill out for a late afternoon. Friendly staff albeit rushed off their feet, so the service can be a little slow. But C'est la vie!
3
Love the shrimp truffle Angel hair. The restaurant space can be a bit tight with uncomfortable booth seats (no back support) and aircon directly blowing at some tables and total heat for tables near the entrance. Otherwise good is decent
4
Excellent, relaxed and cosy restaurant, food tasteful and good wine selection. Was first time visit with the "Survival Chic" card, but for sure not the last. Pricing is also in acceptable range.
5
A great little gem tucked in the middle of a historic district. The restaurant is tastefully designed and makes creative use of its cosy space. We had the grilled beef and shrimp truffled angel hair pasta, and the latter was especially to die for. The place has a dynamic feel but you never feel rushed because the warm service made us feel like family. Will definitely be back
5
After a few visits to Napoleon, I decided to write this review as I have always been delighted with the food and wine. Selection of French wine is really extensive with huge choice by the glass and last but not least , they have plenty of affordable options without compromising on quality.Food wise, it's the same. Never disappointed ! From the hand cut steak tartare to lobster risotto or seared tuna, I have always loved my dinner.I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to enjoy a great evening with top quality food and wine at reasonable prices.Looking forward to going back..
4
Came here for dinner recently and opted for the burrata and Parma ham for starters followed by the seared tuna with truffle oil and some chocolate cake dessert. Pretty happy with all the food. Prices seemed reasonable also. Service was friendly and efficient. The restaurant was quite crowded on a Wed night and there weren't many spare seats
4
Love their wine chiller concept that display the wine for selection. Food was great and service was excellent.
5
Visit this place on monthly basis, they offer an absolutely value for money lunch set ($30 for apprtiser main + coffee) I adore their Prawn / truffle angel hair pasta, it is cooked to perfection. Special call out for their down to earth, no-nonsense wine dispenser by glass
5
32 wine by the glass was a great experience and the food is definitely worth the price paid! Recommended place for gathering or couple date night!
5
Food here was surprisingly good. Tried the truffle wedges and creamy salmon pasta. Value for money. Nice atmosphere for gathering with friends.
5
We had a wonderful and cozy time at Napoleon. The food were fantastically delicious. The variety of wine were best
3
Food was great, however staff seems unsure of what she's doing and can hear kitchen staff scolding vulgarities and talking in hokkian
4
I went today with my daughter. Enjoyed the wine bar experience, but beware of that tasting card and iPad ordering system, u can spend lots of $$$$ easily. Food was good, service was excellent. We had an awesome experience. Pati made our visit, our steward. Taught us the ropes of the wine bar. Those Sing grew fast on that charge card. Beware
5
We arrived on time at the Napoleon and were looking forward to be able to enjoy quality wine by the glass and sample some great finger food having already had an earlier dinner that day. We were not disappointed and ended up having a great evening.
4
We had the chefs lunch which comprises a starter, main and dessert. The portion sizes were good. Food yummy. Will be back.
4
I have spent a few early evenings straight from work recently at Napoleon. The wine selection has been very good, either from the wine list or your ability to self-serve from the selection bar/machine by the glass.The service is very friendly & pricing is very reasonable. I haven't eaten as yet except for a couple of bar/side snacks, but they were of a high standard. I will certainly try a more extensive selection next time. I noticed that is got very busy later in the evening, so check if bookings are needed.Great value for money
4
Well priced wines, many available by the glass,with decent food, great for dinner with friends or wine amateurs
5
We visited this food and wine bar on Saturday. It was not very crowded to my surprise. The food was very good and the service was excellent. We enjoyed the nice ambiance. They have good selection of wine and also other drinks
4
Had the truffle oil shrimp pasta which was good - lots of prawns and very well done, could have added less truffle oil but that is because I don't really like too much truffle oil. Good ambience for a night out.
4
Quiet place gd for catch up. Nice tuna steak. Staff were helpful with wine pairing. Desserts were also nice
5
Felt this restaurant gave us a good value set meal within a very reasonable price! Definately a recommendation for regular dining! 😊
4
Went there for a Valentine's Day dinner with my girlfriend, and the innovative candlelight setup and sumptuous food was amazing. Must tries include the salmon, pan seared tuna and beef cubes.
4
Perfect flavours and servings. didnt get disappointed with the food or service.
managed to share food well and easily with my friends while catching up. Located next to other bars which can be an easy walk to.
2
Great if you like being in a French restaurant with loud American Music. If you are looking for a quiet place to have dinner, this is NOT the place to go. Their menu looks good for a restaurant but you are not in a restaurant, you are in a bar
5
This place is just perfect for couples at night or business for lunch. Their new Menu is EXCELLENT and the wine selection is rather good. For once, this is a spot that import its own wines (if you are tired of the usual cheap wines that every French/Italian places offer in Singapore).The service is amazing, especially if the owner is in the house. As a renown wine lover, Mister "JC" is an amazing host
4
Was here for a lunch with colleagues. Food ordering was done via ipad due to the labour shortage in Singapore. We were seated pretty quick and food came pretty quickly (maybe because we selected the set meals). quality was reasonable and would come back again. Lots of wine available there on tap
4
The first thing about Napoleon is that your orders are placed via iPad. While this may improve productivity greatly, I prefer the personal touch of having a waiter/waitress take my order; allows me to ask questions and clarify anything I'm not sure off.Anyway, the menu is pretty good and has a nice variety of items. We had the PARMA HAM CROQUETTES, GRILLED ANGUS STEAK TENDERLOIN, and the SHRIMPS TRUFFLE ANGEL HAIR. The portions of food were decent. I thought my steak was properly grilled and my dining partner enjoyed the angel hair pasta.But it was the dessert - DUO OF CHOCOLATE GANACHE & MI-CUIT CANELE - that was really good and I recommend that
4
As my wife is born on Bastille Day we thought a little bit of French fare for her birthday dinner. The food was exceptional, we were a little disappointed that they did not do more around Bastille Day but the food definitely made up for that. I was a little disappointed in the wine selection and the trend of using the electronic pourers is good for the variety but the wine loses a little bit of taste. But all in all a highly enjoyable evening for all parties and the food is a must try for flavor and something different in Singapore
5
Great service, great (extensive) wine list, good food and a great atmosphere!
Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore
5
Great wine selection and I recommend the lobster risotto. The manager is very friendly and focus on customer service. Nice place for food and drink...
5
People said in Singapore either you go to 5 star or hawkers' food stall. In between you have to be very lucky to find something really good but at reasonable price. This one is worth recommending to anyone who loves steak and wine. I really like their steak and lamb (at two different visits). The waiter (Eric) told me they are casual fine dining, I totally agreed. I tried the dessert once- lemon tart which was a bit disappointing. The one being served was bit different from the menu, you are warned! But on the whole, it is a good place to enjoy for an evening. I will definitely go back, you will join me?
2
Terrible experience, wasted our time and money:- buratta cheese was not fresh, needed to send it back to the kitchen- fois gras was partially oxidized since not fresh enough- black pepper was spoilt due to humidity, not even changed by the staff- truffle pasta was too oily, felt sick the all night- very poor service, unprofessional, with staff not even changing the cutlery from one plate to the next- atmosphere not nice as the restaurant is too small with badly managed AC, staff was not even able to fix it- finally and fortunately the wine was goodNever again, it smells bankruptcy
2
Good location and great idea to have what are some good french wines available by the glass . Thats where the good stuff ends unfortunately. Whilst the wine system implemented is good the amount of wine dispensed for the price was very small and therefore results in what could be considered over priced.The food also was very disappointing, cold cuts, cheeses and steak tartare that was pretty tasteless and over processed. For a french restaurant to run out of foie gras is sacrilege
1
Having now read reviews on this restaurant I wish we had never gone there! The service is dreadful - we went tonight and the manager/boss/owner was so busy entertaining a table of 18 of his friends that all other guests were forgotten. This is Singapore and the restaurant is expensive - ordering by iPad is not my Idea of a good restaurant and when our entree arrived within 8 minutes of ordering, we were not impressed. We specifically asked the waitress for a long space of time before our main meal arrived. We said the entree arrived too quickly and we did not want our main arriving so quickly that we were done with dinner in 30 minutes. The waitress acknowledged this but our main was then served almost immediately! We complained and said it was way too fast, and she said that it had obviously been lost in translation. I think not - we all spoke perfect English. The most disappointing aspect of all this was that the manager continued to sit with his table of mates and at no time,even after his staff informed him of our displeasure, did he attempt to come near us, in fact he ignored us completely and avoided all eye contact. Very very poor service. Disgusted with his attitude. Service like this is just not acceptable as prices are so steep. We had finished our meal in less than an hour - their answer was to give us a free dessert which we just did not eat.The manager/owner, whoever he was,needs raking over the coals - customer service is non-existent in this restaurant. And our food was cold - we sent it back when It arrived so early, then realised we may as well eat it or possibly wait an hour for it to reappear, so asked for it to be served anyway, took another 10 minutes to bring it back and of course it was cold. This place is a product of its management which is totally lousy.
3
Cosy ambience with a good selection of wine. Loved that I could choose one glass after another without asking for the menu. Also, you can choose either a tasting portion, half a glass or full glass. Good for couples and business lunch and dinners. Would go again one day if I am in the area
4
Situated in a charming part of Singapore, this little restaurant is a gem. We opted for a range of bar food all of which was very tasty - the home made corn chips were fabulous
4
I went with a group of friends and was quite excited by the tasting on demand concept. There was a broad selection of (only) french wines to choose from and depending on the wine, the size, the price is charged to your card (could be dangerous as the evening stretches..). A playful way to taste a good selection of wines
4
Even though it's been here for a while I've just discovered a hidden treat. The Napoleon wine bar and bistro on Telok Ayer Street offers a huge selection of wines by the glass and great food from their tiny kitchen. The wine selection is all French but covers the full spectrum from Bordeaux to Beaujolais, Reds to whites, and dry to sweet. You can buy tasting portion, half and full glass sizes and get expert advice from the staff. Only a few tables so book in advance.

Made a reservation for 4 and was the second lunch group for the day. Requested for the actual table for 4 and was told it was reserved and had to settle at the larger table at the end of the restaurant that sits 8, which the other 4 was reserved as well.Waiter was eager to explain the various lunch sets in his bullet-speed pace and we decided to refer to the menu presented in the IPAD mini ourselves. Order was a breeze via the device. The other waitress came over and confirmed our order and off we wait for our food. Awhile later, the kitchen staff came by and attempt to confirm our order again. This time round, they missed out on one set lunch and we had to correct him. That's not the end though and the same waiter who confirmed our order in the beginning came over again and for the 3rd time, we were asked to verify our orders. Talked about being efficient over technology but the additional frustration arise from human beings.Food was served without waiting long since we were early. The table of 4 beside us waited for almost 40 minutes and they were even not the latest to arrive in the restaurant. Simply put, the small kitchen of 2 chefs is simply unable to cope with a full house lunch crowd.Food quality was average, to the extent it was quite bland for all our 4 different main courses. Waited 20 minutes for our dessert and the ice cream that came with the apple crumble was already melting.This should be the first and last visit for me
5
Unparalelled experience. Everything about our meal was perfect. The food was plate-licking good, the service was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere of the place and the music were excellent.One of the best meals I have had in Singapore, and certainly the best value!Try this restaurant
5
We had the evening dinner menu. It was really very delicious. Great staff. Worth to try ;) go for it you will definitely enjoy it ;)
4
Service was great - Precious, our server was attentive, engaging and knowledgeable about her wines. The ambience and music was nice, and the wines are quite good. Food wise, we had the cheese platter and the foie gras terrine. Both were good (but not anything above that)
2
When we got to Napoleon it was buzzing at the bar but strangely quiet in the restaurant at the back, soon we found out why.Napoleon tries to be hi tech, how you buy the wine to how you order the food, which we found fiddly and needed the serving staff help, which I kind guess loses the purpose. The other downside for the restaurant is the tablet menu shows artistic photographs of the food, which is a bit of a problem when what you get is a pale imitation of what's in the photo.Napoleon's style is, I think, a kind of modern Asian take on classic French/British fare, lamb shank served "pulled", beef tenderloin done bourguignon style with some chiili. The lamb was just about okay, not much of it and almost cold (how can you serve food cold when it comes straight out of the kitchen behind us). The beef did nopt appear with the heap of steaming mas in the photo but a thin smear underneath a thin and not very flavoursome gravy. Also served at room temperature. After that we paid and left
3
Very good wine by the glass but a strange set up. Small outdoor capacity, no atmosphere really. Left within 20 minute
3
I had good deal from a 1 for 1 promotion. We went on a weekday night and it is not crowded at all. Quiet and peace so we like the ambience and environment. Ordered the lobster risotto($30++) and a tuna dish($23++), not the famous dish in the restaurant but I think we had the correct choice. Both generally tasted quite good. Did not taste any of their wine but I feel it can be a good place to chill and hang out for a group of friend
4
Dined here with another couple.Food was good however servings could be argued as being a little on the smaller side however quality was good, Gimmicky wine tasting set up whereby you can sample around 20 odd wines with sample sizes from 15Mil up to full glass - Would think for a girls night out this would be a good place to go as lots of variety.Service was OK however nothing to write home about however was pretty quiet on night we were in so could be something to do with it.Overall happy with experience and would recommend to others to atten
4
We dined at Napoleon for the first time a couple o' weeks ago and we thought the experience was not so bad. First-off, we liked the fact that it's tucked away in a relatively quiet neighbourhood and the ambience is just perfect for a quiet (may even be romantic) French dinner. We thought the food that we ordered - red wine-soaked chicken and a salmon dish - was prepared very well. Service was not too bad, probably because there weren't a lot of people at that time, but we did get our food warm and pretty, from the aesthetics point of view.:) The only let-down was the rosÃ© wine Hubby ordered which tasted like a bad vinegar. We didn't bring this to the attention of the restaurant staff or manager anymore because we were rushing off to an event that night. In any case, I wouldn't mind going back there again, if only for the food and perhaps to try a different wine
1
I don't recommend Napoleon Food & Wine Bar.This will be the first and last time I dine at this place.The food served at Napoleon was just average, nothing particularly fancy that would wow one. Wine selection was commendable.The worst and what I find most offensive was the service. While the rest of the service crew were relatively polite when serving and clearing tables, the manager herself (or so she claimed to be) was rude and inattentive.When it came to asking for the bill, she unceremoniously dumped the bill on our table and walked off. My friend and I had wanted to request for the bill to be split, but she walked off before we could ask for anything further.So I walked up to the counter to respectfully make our request known. Instead of looking up to listen to what I had to say, she distractedly said: "Just tell me how much to charge."Now this is not something I hear all the time, so my natural assumption was to tell her which items I wanted to charge to each bill/card and the rest of the tax calculations would follow. Apparently that was not the case.The bill was split unevenly and when I asked calmly, she raised her voice: "Its what YOU told me to do. OUR customers usually tell us what to charge."And when I mentioned her instruction to me (to tell her what to charge) were perhaps unclear since I clearly did not understand what she meant, she retorted: "Maybe YOU were not clear."As I said, this is the first time I was dining at the place, so how was I supposed to know their customers' usual practice?At that point, I was relatively annoyed and said I would likely highlight this to their management. Her response -- she took a calling card, gave it to me and said (in a tone less than sincere): "Well anyway, I'm the manager. Sorry you didn't have a good experience.
5
Second experience in this concept and this time i was able to enjoy the wide selection of wines and different tastings. The menu was full of new discovery compare to last time, but always with same quality.
5
Lovely restaurant with a great niche wine selection process and ipad orders. Staff really friendly and helpful. Food was delicious. Our favourite restaurant in Singapore!!
5
Went there for an evening with friends, friendly staff, great service and an amazing wine list!
A must go to place when in Singapore! .
1
Went there a few times. Seems like nothing has changed since they opened so finally taking the time to give a feedback. Service is super poor, super slow (2 bartenders for more than 50ppl) so you're waiting half an hour between each drinks. One toilet only so expect a massive queue inside. Table are put randomly outside, to get around is a nightmare ..
4
I stumbled across this wine bar (no pun intended :-) while exploring the Telok Ayer area. I was looking to buy a bottle of wine and was pleasantly surprised to see a great variety of wines on offer. The owner was very friendly and informative. I tried a few wines for free then bought a couple of bottles. There is a 30 % discount on takeaway sales.I would love to try the food there some time
5
The set lunch at $23 is value for money -- very nice salad with grilled shrimp, and chicken with red wine sauce. The chicken may need more seasoning, found it a bit bland, but is still ok. The dessert is not included, but anyway ordered lemon tart which is about $7. The dessert is so delicious, has just the right sweetness, the pastry is crisp, the ice cream included has a bit salt, which is so nice. Also ordered wine, we got the house wine at $45. This is one of the best lunches I've had
4
I was in Singapore on a business trip and we stumbled upon Napoleon Food & Wine Bar, which has an extensive list of wines by the glass. Food is modern European style, with a diverse selection of appetizers, mains and desserts. We opted for a few glasses of wine and a couple sharing platters. The Mixed platter had a few different hams and cheeses to choose from and the portions were generous. The ambience is very warm and inviting and service attentive. All and all, a great spot to relax and enjoy a glass of wine. Next time we will try the rest of the food menu. As usual, Singapore for drinks is always expensive, doesn't matter where you go!
5
Found this fab little place quite by accident last night. Looked dingy from the outside, but WOW! When you enter it is a different world. The decor is great....loved the ambience and the bistro feel. We didn't have a reservation, but they found a spot for us. I love the way you peruse the menu...and wines....on a mini ipad, then place your order yourself. Ran like clockwork. Clever way to not have your wait staff running around like crazy. They could concentrate on looking after their customers. They did this brilliantly. Loved the food too. Charcuterie platter to share...yum! Tenderloin cooked sou vide style was sensational. My pulled lamb shank....awesome! We even managed to squeeze in the yummiest apple crumble...THEN there are the wines...fantastic selection. We had a wonderful bottle. But the other option of Self Serve from a wall of wines.... Brilliant. You can choose the size of yr measure....a taste, half glass or full measure. Great way to not break the bank but get to try some awesome high end wines.Loved this place. Both food & wines were reasonably priced. Especially considering the quality. Think we will have to become regulars
3
This should be a regular haunt for me - it has a lovely ambience, a great concept around tasting various wines as a sampler or a full or half glass, a great menu and a good location in the trendy bistro-bar area of Telok Ayer street. BUTThe kitchen service really lets it down! Orders are done via a mini iPad but seem to get lost in a black hole where half an order arrives and the rest disappears or orders are not captured. Worse still, the 2 chefs are clearly visible to customers and only one seems to be doing all the work while the other stands around, hand on hip, talking and chewing on whatever's available. Many hands make light work? Not here!On mentioning this to the very helpful and friendly bar lady / supervisor (?), she basically shrugged her shoulders and admitted that she knew about it but that the employee was a local ie nothing could be done! Imagine.... So in summary, maybe opt for an apero before dinner somewhere else to avoid frustration
5
This is an excellent little place in Singapore. One of my girl friends took me here for a night out and it was wonderful. The service was excellent! Very friendly they knew my friend and treated us just like we were family in their home. The food was also excellent. We had a braised chicken, that makes you want to eat more, there is a carrot puree that is to die for on this dish. The Mozzarella salad is perfect for sharing, as it is so rich that, I would not have been able to finish it all my self.The real point of interest here is the wine. First, they have an excellent selection of French wines, that range from every prominent region in the country. This is nice because, all to often, you only see Bordeaux or Burgundy. Second, they have a great way of serving wine - IT IS SELF SERVE by the glass. You get an automated card and you just put it in the machine, you can for different prices try a sample of wine, have 1/2 a glass of wine, or get a full glass. This is the perfect place to go if you want to experiment with wines you have not tried before and not break the bank
5
Excellent food and beautiful wine list. Great service also. If you stop in Singapore, you have to go there!
5
All perfect. Wines, food and atmosphere. A must go in Singapour for wine lovers and French cuisine. You can drink 50 differents wines by the glass and decide the accurate quantity you want. Excellent concept
4
very good little bar in a great part of town, some really good wines and excellent atmosphere. low point is some of the staff, some are great and some terrible. will continue to go often however
4
For me Napoleon is perfect, it’s a stone’s throw away from the CBD yet has an incredibly warm and cosy atmosphere. I really liked the concept of having iPads on the table which showed us the various wines and the food menu. I ordered the Coq au Vin, which was divine, and managed to get through several glasses of wine from their wine dispenser, a thoroughly enjoyable evening. Also a good lunch spot, with yummy sets
5
One of the best places in Singapore to get some European dishes and a great selection of wines.The service was awesome, and there's a real personal charm to the place. The decoration makes this place really special. Often there to have a drink/eat/meet new people
4
Arguably the star of the restaurant is the wall of Enomatic wine dispenser machines. Ranging from affordable wines to pricier Grand Crus, one can have a sample of each, or all. The process is relatively simple. Grab a value-card from the bar, then walk to the machines. Easy peasy lemon squeeze. The most difficult bit is choosing which vinos to start with and how much you want to start with! For tasters (from $2) to half (from $4) or full (from$8), you will be spoilt for choice. There's a certain charm and childishness in choosing how much you should try before you go 'full retard'.The selection is easily categorised for non-wine snobs. Take your pick of grapes ranging from smooth, spicy, fruity or sweet. Or for those sommelier wannabes, descriptors such as ‘berries’, ‘liquorice’ and ‘citrus’, will w(h)et your thirst for more. I have not tried the food yet so I can't quite make a comment. Will try to the next time I head back. If I can peel myself away from the Enomatic machines, that is
5
My husband and I had dinner here one night and it was delicious. The service was great. They were very attentive even though you can order through the iPad. I loved the wine dispensing machine. I order the chicken in red wine sauce and it was so good. My husband ordered the squid carbonara and loved it. We ordered the apple crumble for dessert and it was amazing. We enjoyed tasting the different wines and loved the ambiance of the wine bar. We would for sure dine here again or just come for a drink
5
I have probably walked pass by the area a couple of times and i never noticed Napoleon. We took a peak inside and the place was amazing! They have this wine machine where you can pick and dispense your own wine doing away with the fancy treatment. But then again, if you would prefer to be served the fancy way you can order your wine selection from the mini ipad menu which is so cool. I love their pasta ( shrimp truffle capellini ) and the grilled steak which is done to perfection and the portions are so generous. The staff were very attentive and friendly. Thank you so much for a great evening! I will surely come back
5
It is or you jump in a warm bath tub! This place is run by the heart; very welcoming staff and friendly service! The i-Pad service system is very efficient, and it makes your waiting time much shorter, so the service staff have more time to make a talk with you, and most important, gives you a good advice and information about the wines!A great selection is presenting you in different pricings; and the possibility for tasting first is great! Even with not some much wine knowledge you can enjoy the best combination! Very reasonable prince and a good balance in value for money! This concept is very refreshing…. I’m so sad is not live in Singapore…. I like to recommend this place to everybody who like a nice time, in a good atmosphere, with a very welcoming service at a great price! Thank you so much for welcoming us

This is the first wine bar in Singapore my husband and I can finally call "home". I love the fact you can do a tasting of wines before purchasing a full glass. So many options, and they have the most divine sweet wine and desserts! We always order the meat and cheese plates, plentiful and always fresh. Looking forward to trying the lobster risotto, my friends are raving about it! If you want a cozy atmosphere (and yes they accept reservations!) with a nice glass of wine and good conversation, Napoleon is a must

I’ve been to this restaurant a few times for lunch and dinner over the last three months or so, hoping it would get better but to date is hasn’t (and I think today was the last opportunity it’s going to get). It’s a real shame because the food in here is pretty good value, especially for the set lunch, but it’s everything else that lets it down. The service is cold and impersonal, the gimmicky ipad ordering system is annoying rather than helpful (there’s always a need to ask for clarification so why can’t we just order from a waiter instead), and the place just lacks any kind of atmosphere. The decor is really well done and looks like it should be a cozy and welcoming place but the lack of friendly faces kills it. In all honesty, it feels like a non-restauranteur has thrown a ton of cash at a nice looking restaurant but hasn’t much idea of customer service

The dispenser is a great solution for a country that doesn't understand service.Excellent selection of wines.Get a seat outside as the seats inside are tightly placed. Especially at the bar where it's impossible to get onto your seat. The seat at the far end is so close to the chair behind that both guests have to duck every time someone walks through the tiny gap. Removing one stool would solve these and make everyone more comfortable.The team is friendly and efficient except the hostess who was busy chomping away.

The restaurant offers a good selection of wines that you can just help yourself with. Not being a big drinker, I like that I can sample a few different wines at smaller portions (however note that a small portion is PRETTY small). The food was good and atmosphere relaxing and not too crowded. I found service to be great and the owner/server even noticed that type of wine that we liked and gave us a sample of one, which I thought was a nice touch. I'm not a big fan of using ipad to order and it seems unnecessary given the size of the restaurant. This is the 2nd restaurant I've encountered that uses this system and on both occasion the order actually didn't go through because I didn't press confirm. I think the bar would feel more intimate if there are servers taking orders

Decent reviews on tripadvisor and $8 wine sounds good until you realise it's for half a glass (75ml), small portions for mediocre food, bad service and the overall ambiance doesn't suit the concept. We were surrounded by wires and the ipads that you order through didn't work properly.Also, was strange to me that it's self-service with the menu yet they add the same service charge on.Definitely wouldn't go back and would warn people against it seeing as there are so many other places that are better value for higher quality food

My husband and I stopped here for our anniversary for dinner while we were in town visiting. We were seated and the woman who sat us explained how to use their card system to taste the wines. There is a cooler along the wall with maybe 14 different wines. You can peruse the selection, then when you decided what you'd like, you pop your card (it looks like a room key) into the slot at the top, then select your wine. You could choose a taste, a small glass or a glass. I didn't like it because you get exactly 2oz. When I order wine at a restaurant, I'm looking forward to an overpour, if you know what I mean. Alcohol is marked up at such a price, it was kind of depressing to see what an actual 8oz pour looked like. So I ordered a Manhattan to drink before our food came out. It never came. The food was good, but for the price and the service, I'd pass

My wife and I ate here on Friday night. Put in a reservation a few hours earlier online. They seemed busy when we got there, but cleaned a table outside and we were able to get a seat quickly. All ordering is done by iPad. Several of the wines that we tried to order (the cheaper ones) were out of stock, but we were able to find a few that were still reasonably priced and good quality. The cheese platter was excellent. Tuna was good. Shrimp salad was good. Dessert was great. The service was very fast. Because all ordering is done electronically, we didn't have to flag a waiter down to order. As soon as we put it in, the order is presumably getting started in the kitchen. This made it easy to order one thing at a time at our leisure. Each time would be brought out in just a couple minutes after ordering. When I did need to flag someone down for the check, it was quite fast. Atmosphere/music was good. Next time we'd probably get a table indoors but if you're used to the Singapore weather, it wasn't too hot in the evening to sit outside.Rating 4 out of 5 because of the couple of wines being out of stock and while not unreasonable, it was a little on the pricey side

My wife and I visited Napoleon in late Sept 2013. The restaurant was empty when we arrived but was told the indoors tables were all reserved. We settled for outdoors as we have no preference. They have this iPad ordering system where you are given iPads to key in your orders - pretty cool in my view. Our wines came quickly and it was a good start. However, our cheese platter and roasted beef took 45 mins. The food was mediocre and did not justify the price. We saw no other customers during our time there. Look for better value / service elsewhere. P.S. The local staff were friendly but the french (presumably) were cold

Until now we cant forget the experience when we came to Napoleon . Their design is so elegant . I can see the customers are so interested in wine machines . We can enjoy many kinds of wine . The food is so delicious . Price is quite cheap but worth it. Staff is so friendly. They instruct us to order on ipad. That s the most wonderful thing I 've got . Atmosphere is so fine for business or couples. We love i

I was completely satisfied with this wine bar. Service was very good, food and wine sublime! I loved the concept of wine machines which allows you to taste a lot of wines! Last but not least, it is really good value for money! This experience exceeded my expectations. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a nice time discovering more about wine and food paring

My friend and I went for lunch. We didn't book a table but we got a table ok. The waiter showed us how to order our food on the ipad. There is one ipad on the table so you have to wait until the other person has placed their order before you can have a look.There was different menus to choose from. You have can have a soup and a starter, a 3 course meal with tea and coffee for 35 dollars or just order a main course. My friend and I went with the 3 course meal. The food was delicious. The wine is very good as well. They have a choice of 32 wines. You can ask the waiter for a card and you can choose to taste all the winesor have a half glass or a full glass. You give the waiter the card back and they just charge it to your bill. The restaurant is beautiful inside. I would go back again

I love this place! This is a great neighbourhood gem with an interesting concept around wine and delicious food. This place is a great combination of coziness and modern design. It is warm and inviting. The crowd is nice, Napoleon is suitable for all ages.The food excels with just the right portions! Flavourful, creative, and beautifully presented dishes in an elegant setting. My favorite is the poached salmon, which was served with green pea mashed potatoes. The riesling cream sauce made for a great extra touch to the dish. My favorite desert would definitely be the tiramisu, served with vanilla ice cream and to-die-for homemade crumble...The service was great and the sommelier made great recommendations for our food-wine pairings. Although the great thing about this restaurant is that you can easily choose yourself by tasting the wines first. I had some tastings starting at 2 SGD, which made my choice of wine so much easier. In the end, it is such a subjective thing. My friend tried some as well and our tastes clearly differed. We could choose among 32 wines by the glass ranging from 8 SGD to really high-ranked grand crus classes by the glass at around 28 SGD. I tried a couple of them. Felt like a kid in front of a vending machine. Wines are a bargain for the quality.Will definitely be back and bring more friends. Wine is finally made accessible and fun thanks to Napoleon

Great place for after work with business partners. Cozy atmosphere with nice french wine, do we need more?The wine there is great and relatively cheap for Singapore. We ordered the cheese plate which is very nice and goes perfectly with the red wine we had (Saint Emilion 2009).Concept of the Enomatic is interesting, and make the experience different. You are not behind a wine list chosing what you want anymore, but you are in front of the machine where they indicated the categories of wine (spicy, dry, etc...), so even if you are not a wine connoisseur, you can still chose the wine knowing what you chose. And not just base your choice on the nam

A must do for wine lovers! The "steak tartare" was perfect!.I also liked the way to order your food.You get an iPad for your table and you just order what you want on the ipad.A few minutes later a waiter server you with what you ordered.The choice of wines a very wide for a restaurant in Singapore. You can taste each wine for a litte price per taste, so you don't need to order a whine tha

We just had wine, no food. Good pointsImpressive selection of French wines. We are no experts but have spent a lot of time in Burgundy in France and have been to many of the villages the wine on offer comes from. The wine machine is quite cool (you just press a button and the wine comes out of a tap as if by magic!). You place your order on an ipad which also gives you an overview of the wines on offer.Bad pointsAgain, we are no experts but we know the difference between a Pouilly Fuisse and a Pouilly Fume... and there are some very good Burgundy wines on offer (e.g. a Mercury Premier Cru, Pouilly Fuisse and a Meursault). However, there is a big difference between a Macon Caves de Lugny and a Pouilly Fuisse - both were on offer - but they were almost the same price for a glass.Also, we were charged a whopping $4.5 to taste the wine before we chose it. Considering we bought a glass of the wine we tried this really got on our nerves as it was not explained in advance that we would have to pay for this. If we had tried several and were given a little explanation of the different wines, then OK, but just to have a dribble of the wine that you buy and are not told the price... well, it left a nasty taste in the mouth as we left!We had red wine but it was served very cold. This is quite common in cellars (which tend to be very cold) and you can warm the glass of wine in your hand... but this was not explained by the staff. We were suprised that this was not explained to us as many people would not know this.

I have been searching for a perfect wine bar in Singapore for a long time. I believe I found it.Napoleon is affordable, cosy and offers a nice selection of food.But most important of all, the wine selection is fantastic and the prices are cheaper than what I expected. You can get a nice glass of wine from 8 SGD.Highly recommended for a date or a dinner with a bunch of friends

My friends and I wanted a special birthday celebratory lunch, something new! We went hunting and chances upon Napoleon Food & Wine Bar. We all had a wonderful set meal with good and friendly service. Our birthday girl commented, Good choice!" We will be back for more soon
