The Kway soup has not much taste though the Kway is very silky...
The pig intestines is clean but portion is rather pathetic... The egg does not have any fragrant taste...
For the price it is rather expensive...

Visited on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch and there were about 5 people in the queue. Service was pretty fast as well. I actually enjoyed watching the large Philips Screen which took up half of the signboard - it showed the history of the shop which dated back to the 1950s. I was actually slightly moved by it (but I'm soft like that). The hawkers were nice and kind to a unsophisticated girl who could barely speak mandarin and order properly (me) so I really, really appreciated that. I've eaten many different bowls of kway chap so don't just dismiss the absoluteness of opinion when I say it's the best kueh I've had (#kwaychapsnob) - it was super soft but firm enough. Innards were cleaned well. Would go back for more
