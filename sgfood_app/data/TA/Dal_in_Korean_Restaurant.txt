Dine here with KTO group and found that the food was nice. We also went to the other branch at Amoy Street. But, I think Amoy Street not serving Korean BBQ. Anyway, there are many selections to satisfy your tummy.

After trying out a few Korean restos around CBD area, this has become our favourite Korean joint. The service is great and food is yummy. The restaurant owners personally look into and make sure that the guests are served well. Definitely coming back again!!!

After trying out many Korean restaurants in Singapore, this place is truly my favourite.
Not only are their food affordable and authentic, but the portions are generous as well.
Also the serving time is quick and efficient, definitely coming back again.

I felt like it was a bit too pricey for what we got and the atmosphere (dive place) ... but that said, the food was very good, service was terrific ... so, we walked out of there satisfied. That says something :) Although I dont think I'd go back

Restaurant serves good Korean food with generous portion of main meal and side dishes. I love the kimchi soup, saba fish and jap chae. Hope that restaurant can offer chicken jap chae as I don't eat beef. Hence I could only order the jap chae on the menu when I have friends who would finish up the meat for me

First time here with a close friend. Am surprised the place fully packed with customers waiting during lunch. Portion of the food was big.. The restaurant is very generous with the ingredient. Will be good if in a group coz then can order more dishes to share.They do have partitions whereby if you have a group gathering or discussion, they can close the door so that you will have privacy though noise level is not really sound proof

I went to Dal In with a vegetarian friend, so we ordered the basic dishes, and we were not disappointed at all. I love the kimchi pancake and the spicy cold noodle!!! The latter was perfectly balanced between sweet and spicy. The side dishes of steamed eggs, fried small fish, and various kimchis were delicious, too. When we arrived, it was crowded and yet the service was fantastic. All in all a very positive experience. I am looking to go back there with more friends to try the meat dish that everyone seemed to order that night
