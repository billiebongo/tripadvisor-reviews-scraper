This restaurant offers consistently good food at a reasonable price. The staff are friendly and offer good service. It's no frills but the food is good . Dinner for five was just $89. The pasta Alfredo, rib eye steak and prawn pasta are very good.

Singapore restaurants are considerably cost but not in this restaurant. Esp. This restaurant is at Orchard area! the Steaks are great for 15 dollars and they serve good deals after lunch.
A must try restaurant if you are in a budget!
Recommended!

Ate at this place twice, quick dinner. Ordered spaghetti with chicken. It was dry and chicken tough. Twice the same no improvement. I thought try 2nd time spaghetti too dry. I tried the branch at NEX was good. I would think different chef. It was convenient location for quick meals

I was looking to have a quick supper and decided on a whim to walk into this little eatery. I wasn't disappointed! Although it was near to closing time, the staff were welcoming and service was quick.I had the rib eye which came with a salad side and spaghetti aglio olio. I also had the escargot. Price was fairly cheap so I was surprised to find that the food was cooked perfectly- better than some fine dining establishments at triple the price I might add! Thank you for such a satisfying meal :

Went there after a long day at St. John island. It was recommended by a friend, and glad that we took his recommendation. I ordered the lobster linguine, my friends ordered Sirloin steak and Steak & prawn. All tasted so good that i can't wait to try it again soon

We were wandering around Singapore Plaza on Orchard Road, looking for a place for an early supper when we came across Hot Tomato and decided to try it. It was exactly what we were looking for. The restaurant was casual and easy going, like a fast food place, but the menu listed items we rarely find at a fast food restaurant. Hankering for Western food, we ordered the rib-eye steak and the steak & prawn combo. The steaks were done to perfection and as tasty as could be. Service was prompt and the servers very helpful as well. For scrumptious dishes at an affordable price, you can’t go wrong at Hot Tomato! We’ll be back

This was very disappointing, had the half chicken and a cup of tea. The chicken was under cooked and all bone fat and gristle, very little meat.the menu said it was a half baby chicken.maybe they should let it grow some meat before they serve it Luke warm. The tea came in a tiny cup, espresso size! No pot no refill, are they rationed on water? The chicken also came with mashed potato which was very watery and flavour less. I think it was the instant powdered stuff, and again a tiny amount. The salad was two lettuce leaves

We visited Tot Tomato Express in STAR Vista mall. This restaurant surprised me in various ways!First, it was the shop manager who stood at the door to welcome customers. Part of the reason why we didn't walk out was that. He knew the exactly right amount to explain, and let customer make the decision.We ordered the food and they were delivered quite fast - during the peak time of Saturday, 7:30pm. Food quality was surprisingly good - for the price. When one of us wanted some ketchup, we asked a waitress, and it arrived within just a minute.Everything was highly efficient - event the bill. When I asked for it, someone appeared with it in 30 seconds. When the manager came and ask "how was everything?", I specifically mentioned that they surprised me with the efficiency. He said, "we have a system", which I had to believe - and, it was working.Only negative was that I wish if there was more space between tables so that we could have a private conversation over the meal
