I visited sankranti in Singapore. "wow" for the food.If feel like i tasted my native food Chicken dum biryani and another day I tasted sankranti special thali. Hat's off to the management for bringing Andhra taste to Singapore.
4
Well the restaurant is more famous for its Andhra cuisine ,Tried some and it was good for a change . Even north Indian food is upto the mark .Cheers
5
More than happy with my dinner tonight. The service was excellent. The food came in 7 minutes and was hot and very tasty. Naan bread was a bit soft but tasted great. No complaints and will definitely eat here again.
5
Always a place to fall back, if you need to taste some nice Spicy Andhra food. Try their Biryani or Bhojnam. If you are in for real spicy stuff, try their Natu Kodi veppudu.
5
This hotel had hit legendary status and trust me certainly deserves it. felt good with the hospitality provided with. Thank you.

Being a malaysian, first time visited restaurant to eat Indian food. They suggested me to taste gongura mutton..with thali. Superb taste, and loved the combination.
5
Food is excellent, I do travel Singapore often, first time I visited Sankranthi, food was really really excellent. Feel like having at home. Real and typical Andhra food. Who are missing Andhra, Indian food can definetly visit this restaurant. I love non vegetarian thaliüëåüèª.
5
Hi... Tried chicken fry biryani from their menu. But to mention their fry items and biryanis are must try. Andhra style and spicy food. Thanks for bringing Andhra to Singapore :) Will keep trying for more variety..üëç
1
The service was very poor n we were waiting very long for food to b served! The food was so so compared to other similar restaurant in Serangoon Road. Would not visit again and recommend this restaurant to anyone.
5
The best andhra food in Asia run by Andhra people at singapore. There is no single item to name it for best as all are equally tasteful. Try andhra ‚Äòthali‚Äô and andhra chicken fry.
5
We went last night to have dinner after a tiring day. We ordered Hot & Sour Soup, Punugulu(Andhra cuisine), Baby corn masala, plain naan, jeera rice, curd rice, buttermilk and lime soda. Food was tasty, staff were courteous, affordable pricing. Clean restaurant and washrooms.
1
No cleanliness! Long waiting time for food! Rude waiters! I can go on adding but not to do that.
Went with a few friends though I know that would be terrible! Came home to eat my dinner!
1
No attendee to attend. Very poor customer service and no proper guidance or assistance to the seatings.
4
The restaurant has a good ambiance with separate sections for families.
The food quality is good with good options available for vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian food.
Taste is very good.
Would definitely prefer going there again.
5
If you are from Sri Lanka, India or any other country which shares similar types of local foods and if you are not familiar with the Chinese types of food you find in singapore, keep the location of this place saved in your phone. Great food
4
After coming to Singapore, as I was new, started searching for places for biryani, found few options, Sankranti is one of them for sure, here Chicken dum biryani is a must try, never tried other items like thali and a la carte menu items, chicken dum biryani comes with 1 big portion of chicken, with few small pieces, chicken is always juicy, spices are perfectly blended in biryani rice and in chicken, perfectly goes with raita. Visited 3-4 times in last 6 months
5
We are from Andhra and hence we were very happy to taste authentic telugu food! Even the north Indian dishes were tasty. They have another restaurant next to it called 'Sri Vakula'. Breakfast was yummy there. Overall, both Sankranthi and Sri Vakula are in our next Singapore visit list!
1
Went with my family for dinner to Sankranti ARC. Waited for 20 minutes for order taking, after I went over to the kitchen and asked for assistance. Only one guy was serving people. About another 20 minutes we were waiting for food. Finally after Super frustrated left the restaurant. The staff are just walking in and around but pretend not seen you!WILL NEVER EVER VISIT AGAIN!!!
4
The restaurant at Alexandra Retail Center is pretty good giving tasty food and near Indian taste. The ambiance is very good and food is served fast. It is expensive when you consider other India food joints in the center, but the food and offerings overrun the expensiveness. The spread is elaborate for you to choose from. You need to be early in afternoons or else the wait time can be very bad due to seating limitations. Enjoy Indian food when near Alexandra retail center
1
The staff has given frustrating experience repeatedly. Don't think I will go one more time and also don't suggest. Went for family lunch on new year day. No proper reception or queue system. Staff is very arrogant and successful to give humiliating experience. At the end we left the restaurant without eating food.
4
Tasty
costly
good place for family
just near mustafa mall in little india
value for money
good service
3
We visited Sankranthi twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Had thali once and biryani the 2nd time. Food was average, service was little slow. Food is priced reasonably by Singapore standards.
4
Sankranti is by far the best place to eat if you are in the east side of Singapore. The price is comparatively high but in terms of taste, no one beats them.
4
I had the buffet at Sankranthi Changi. It is worth the price.
Not a great place to sit for longer time. Crowdy on weekdays. Weekends might be better to visit
4
I have had many meals here since my office was in Changi Business Park. We usually used to have meals, omelette and chicken veppudu which is vey good. I feel biriyanis are little dry but they taste good. Their free juice is one attractive thing to visit this restaurant. Weekday are usually over crowded and weekends deserted
1
I went for lunch with my colleague yesterday (16th November) to the Sankranthi restuarant located in ARC. I ordered two Bhojanam Thalis. When i started eating, I noticed that there was a Cockroach in my rice plate...i asked for the manager...the manager was not there...i asked for the complaint register...it was missing...the person at the reception counter said that he will replace the rice plate but was not apologetic at all...seems to be a nomal case for them...i never expected this in Singapore..

We have been several times to Sankrati@Biopolis since it is located in our office vicinity.So generally, the visit is on Fridays for lunch, and the places is expectedly crowded. We try to go early though.Ambience: Basic, Table and chair are Sofa like.Service: FastPrice: AverageTaste: Good, depends what you have ordered. South Indian food is better.We tried, Bhojanam (South India Veg thali), North Indian Thali, Veg dum biryani, N-V biryanis at different visits.I have settled with Bhojanam. The quantity is good. Variety is plenty and food is fresh. Eating on a banana leaf gives a very nice different feeling which is healthy too. Thali is very wholesome but not heavy on stomach. Love the payasam/ sweet, rasam, hot rotis.North Indian thali isnt that great and is not really North India. It is South Indian thali with rasam and few other dish replaced by north Indian. Tried veg dum biryani in my last outting and there was no veggie and no dum. Though the Chicken was good as per my friends.We will continue to come...Thumps up for Bhojanam
1
We visited Singapore for a trip recently and we went for dinner on the 8th Aug 2016 to sankranthi hotel which was based in syed alwi road.Food wise, its fabulous. We had our dinner and went to pay the bill, and one of the staff was commenting in tamil and was telling something to the other guy who was taking the cash. They were commenting badly about telugu people . My husband understands and can speak tamil, may be the staff were not aware of that. They were commenting about me. Then I thought they might be commenting about everyone in the same way.Don't know how the management hire such staff who has no respect towards a family or any women.Disgusting staff. Will never visit again.People just be careful if you don't know tamil, The staff there pass comments on women even though you go with a family
4
Decided to drop by for lunch on a weekday at the Little India outlet opposite Mustafa. Felt adventurous and decided to try out the Indian Chinese cuisine. The chicken fried rice was well made and decided to have chili chicken dry with it. The chili chicken was spicy and tasted good. They took about 10 mins to prepare the dishes. The quantity would be good enough for 2 people if you are an average eater. For a large appetite, this should suffice for a single person.The place is clean and airconditioned with clean loos and it does brisk business from the office crowd during lunch. It is a good place for bringing family and kids and is probably more famous for its Andhra cuisine. The total bill was SGD 22.80 for the two dishes. People on a budget would do well to avoid this outlet.
1
First let me tell you about these servers here. Any youngster talking about women behind you is usual. But, these guys are so disgusting that they talk bad about women (can be your wife, sister or your daughter next) in front of you assuming you don't know the language they talk. One of the fools was commenting my wife when I was paying my bit. As I know little Tamil I barely understood what he said at that point but realized exactly what he said once I searched up in internet later when I reached my hotel. If I did understood his comments there and then I would have smashed his face. Hopefully hotel management takes action on this guy to fix their reputation. Food was OK but I would never take my family there
4
Great value for money. Bhojanam is good deal. But i love the non veg delicacies. Mutton biryani and chicken sum biryani are must try.
4
Ambience is good
Cleanliness is good
Nice andhra food
Slightly expensive in comparison to Tamil Indian restaurants but it's worth visiting especially when you are with your family
5
Stumbled on this restaurant after visiting the Mustafa Centre and found the food and quality faultless.
Can really recomend the Fish Tikka and the Chicken Tawa Masala
4
I tried many Indian restaurants in Singapore but I would definitely rate this as one of the best restaurant.
It's bit pricey but it's definitely worth the every penny you pay.
If you are Hyderabadi Dum Biryani lover then look no further.

They have this lousy app with QR code on the table for you to scan and do the ordering I would not recommend it, i tried it and the item didnt come for 1 hour and i had to call/waive at the red tshirts guys to make the order, i didnt notice it in the bill until now that i was actually charged for the item that i ordered through the app as well as with the waiter. What a daylight robbery. Always crowded during 12-12:30 after that more empty chairs i wonder if anyone goes back to this place once they try there. Food is average but its the service that annoys everyone time it takes to prepare the food, i ordered butter chicken it took almost 40 mins to arrive unless you tell that you are preparing the butter chicken and when people order i dont think thats the case. This place could do better if you improve the service and hire more staff. Comparing to other indian restaurants like Raj which is nearby this place really needs more improvement. They dont really carry much in the menu and not really authentic andhra taste
2
We liked the Syed Alwi road Sankranti. Was craving for Andhra food and decided to head out to the outlet in tampines, this being closer to our home. For one thing we didn‚Äôt realise its‚Äô not a proper restaurant but more of an eat out catering more to the office goers around the area. So kind of disappointed with the little variety on offer, the seating outside, in the hot Singapore afternoon, just canopy providing all the cover that is there, not my idea of a Sunday afternoon lunch
4
Located very close to Mustaffa, this restaurant specializes on Andhra food (veg & non-veg) though they have other cusines as well. They also serve beer . Had Veg Andhra meals (they call it as bhojanam) and was satisfied with the quality . I didn't try other cusines so cannot comment on it but definitely worth giving a try if you want to have Andhra food. Service I thought was little bit slow but not bad overall
1
We had dinner at sankranti and we expected a max delay of 10-15 minutes delay as we were dining during non peak hours. Our meal arrived 40 minutes late and it tasted terrible with floating pieces of uncooked tomato in the curry. The most uncourteous manager who starts screaming on asking why there is a delay instead of apologizing. I would never dine here again and will never recommend it to anyone who expects a badic service 
4
The vegetarian thali was very good and for those who miss Andhra food it is the best alternative. The non vegetarian items are good especially lamb. They served for 6 of us tali and side dishes in half an hour but to serve 2 of us rotis it took them nearly an hour. They seem to be understaffed. The ambience and service is average
4
Excellent Andhra food.Please try the below dishes Chicken - Kodi Iguru (absolutely delicious)Mutton - Mamsam VepuduGhee Rice is delicious ! Please also try egg curry of you enjoy boiled eggs.I would avoid fish - unless the restaurant confirmed that the fish is fresh before placing the order. Overall a good restaurant and well priced.
3
We went Sankranti for a weekend Brunch and tried Indo-Chinese there.We did not like the food :( May be, next time we will try Andhra food there.
5
Enjoyed Authentic Andhra food at Little India. Very close to main shopping Mustafa center. Missed Gongura chutney and all other items were good.
4
Had dinner there 3-4 times and the experience was always great. Liked the north indian as well as south indian dishes. Keep up the good work.
5
Best Andhra food in Singapore, my default place for weekend lunch plans .
Andhra bhojanam, Biryani and Paneer Tikka are my regular picks, many options available for vegetarian foodies like me.
5
Very tasty, spicy Andhra cuisine. Excellent service with a smile. Konkura lamb is a must try. Chilli bhaji was amazing. There was also a fish appetizer which was out of this world.
Will definitely visit again.
2
I went many times to this restaurant but find this time the food quality is below average and staff is very rude. I would suggest to avoid this restaurant on Saturday. Too much crowd and too bad service. Quantity is also very less.
4
Tried natukoli fry biriyani. Its one of the best biriyanis I ever had. Highly recommended! Other favorites include Bhojanam, kodi vepudu, chicken 555, mushroom pepper dry.
4
Visited many times. Food quality is good and consistent. Moderate cost. Not cheap and not too expensive.
1
Went for dinner around 7:00 P.M at ARC beanch. Asked for items in the menu none of them were available especially parathas! The attitude of the waiter was another disappointing thing as even he noticed us the menu was given only after I asked for it. He was listening to music inside kitchen and after I called him he came to ask for order! Wanted to give 0 rating. Will never visit again
2
Food was average-to-poor, with all the curries being extremely spicy.Manager had a pretty bad attitude towards us for I-dont-know-what; maybe he had a huge queue waiting outside and he wanted to wrap up soon.If you wanna go, try your luck on the weekdays - might get a tad better service owing to less crowd
3
Try the gongura chicken. The veg thali seemed pretty elaborate but given the meat options, didn't try much of it. The spicy fish starter was also pretty good. However, all non-veg dishes are with bones.
5
Best place in Singapore (Mustafa area) for authentic Andhra food. You would get awesomw Thali (meals).
5
Had a great meal here. Portions were just right, although only need a rice between 2. Service very good and prices good value. Be warned, they don't have a licence to sell alcohol, but good to drink water when eating spicy. Didn't get ripped off with extra charges on the menu price either. Would definitely recommend
1
Walk in for a quick lunch, order chapati and keema which came up to $17.30, still kept faith based on the review on this site. Big mistake , coz when the food arrived was so disappointed. 2 small piece of chapati the size of a parata and a small bowl of keema which had more green peas the mutton. $17.30 for this is a day light robbery. What is more amusing is how are the receiving excellent review of more than 70% from the public....? Never in my life going there again or recommending to any one...! Thumbs down to all the way...!
5
I would say Sankranti is the only restaurant that maintains consistency. All other famous restaurants generally reduce their spice level to cater to various customers but Sankranti always serves traditional spicy Indian food.If we need to eat outside on Saturday's we definitely go to Sankranti as the veg meals served here are the best compared to any other restaurant, atleast for me. Chicken, Mutton and Prawn briyanis are irresistable. Andhra chicken fry and chilli baby corn are also yummy.Free drinks are served here which you can't find anywhere else too
4
My family and I go to Sankranti every weekend to have Bhojanam and Biryani. I am not a fan of the interiors as the place is congested and sometimes unclean but the food is so tasty and irresistible. Expect a waiting time of 10 to 15 mins to get a table on weekends and public holidays. You can flip through the menu card and make up your mind while you are waiting for the table. Also you can use the ipad provided on each table to place your order
5
We eat here almost every third day for lunch. What is striking is the simplicity of the food and the consistency - all this at a very affordable price. Sankranti has mastered the art of mixing spices - every dish is unique in its own. We never get tired of eating here. I love their Gongura Kodi - got addicted to it
4
A great place to have a wholesome meal. We ordered thalis and oh yes, it was the typical huge thali with lots of varieties and very delicious. We have also had veg biryani take away which was mouth-watering. I literally couldn't stop eating even after being full
5
Being a food lover sankranti has always been my one and only favourite restaurant in little India. Always satisfying me and my family. Be it non veg or vegetarian, north Indian, south Indian, Andhra , Indo Chinese they have never disappointed us. Their service is also satisfying. you can very well expect a long queue on weekends and public holidays. Its the one for spicy eaters! We are never fed up of filling our tummy's here :
5
Every time I visit Singapore, I make it a point that I go there and have the Vegetarian Andhra Meals. The quality of food and the service is pretty awesome. Its locational advantage also adds up as it is right opposite Mustafa Centre. Don't forget to try their Chilli bajjis
4
We went to Biopolis branch of Sankranti for Dinner. Drinks are reasonable priced and so is food. We tried 4 types of chicken. Chicken 65 was the star and so was black pepper chicken.Tandoori chicken was made fresh after we ordered. Chicken Tikka masala was horrible, may be we shouldn't have tried authentic north indian dish in this typical south indian speciality restaurant.Ambience not much as it caters mainly to lunch crowd. Quality is consistent.Overall a trusted brand
5
As the name suggests it is andhra cusine, quite different from the south indian or indian cusine.The place is quite nice and right opposite to Mustafa. One should try punugulu or mirchi bajjiand bojhanamu. A reccomendation is also to try gongura chicken or mutton, which is quite unique to andhra cusine.A gerat place for spicy andhra food
4
The place was empty when we walked in, but it was packed when we left.The food dishes all tasted different.¬† A great sign of a good restaurant.¬† Mostly chicken and vegetarian dishes.¬† The nann was hot, fresh, and had a unique flavor - really good too!We had the buffet with folks from work.¬† Very comfortable and a good price $15 which included a drink, tax, and service changes.¬† I will be coming back
4
A refresher to get an authentic Andhra meal in Singapore. We had andhra meal plus a prawns vepudu. Prawns was average, but the meal was very good. A nice mix of veggies, pickles, dal, rasam and other stuff. The pickles were extra ordinary. A little room of improvement would have been the service which was slow, given there were few waiters.
3
I could not find the Sankranti outlet in Alexandra Retail Centre (ARC) separately hence writing the review here. This is close to my office & we went for a linch on Friday. We were a group of 6 people. The place was crowded. There seemed to be a bit of mess when it came to finding a place to sit. While people were eating there were others standing next to the table to occupy it even before the food was over. There were enough staff to serve. I guess one of them could very well coordinate to make seating arrangement a better experience for customers specially during the rush hour. We ordered our food and somehow managed to get a table for all 6 of us. The food was served in reasonable time. The spoons & forks were missing on the table. Same for the water glasses. It was not replaced and we had to remind the staff to get them for us. One of my team member informed me that the management of the restaurant has changed and the food quality is much better now. The quantity & the taste were good. Overall experience was ok. If you prefer spicy food it is good place to try some South Indian (Andhra) dishes. Being close to my office, I would visit this place in future but seriously I would like to see an improvement in their service levels
5
What I like about Sankranti is their chicken and vegetable biryani. Of all the outlets in Singapore, we prefer the one at Little India as the taste is unbeatable. When not in a mood to eat the Biryanis, their Chinese dishes (American Chopsuey, noodles, manchurian ) ate equalliy delactable. Also must try is the mirchi bhaji (Bijjalu
5
Just bang opposite the Mustafa entrance nestled in multitude of Tamil Nadu and North Indian cuisines is this quintessential Andhra restaurant."Sankranthi".dont be mistaken by the inconspicuous staircase leading to the second level where the restaurant overlooks the ever busy Syed Alwi road. Walls are adorned with the very own Andhra's famed cartoonist "Bapu"'s murals. Take a second to watch the painting .esp the ones with women. It is colloquial phrase in Andhra Pradesh to give a compliment to a beautiful woman "Like a Bapu drawn woman" referring to the accentuated form of womans beauty inhis drawing.The Food is very good.Service matches the food as well. When you sit down the appertif is mango drink..just nice to open the palate to the gastronomical andhra adventure. Serves Indian Chinese( that whcih you wont find in china), and Tandoor and of course Andhra.My recommendation is the vegetarian thali called BHOJANAM ( in telugu it means lunch/dinner). Which always cured my homesickness.:)It comes with a good serving of rice and assortment of lentils, vegetable curries, sambar rasam and yogurt/curd. Start of with little oil/ghee and the "kandipodi" it will be on the table along with the pickles..slowly move to the lentils and curries..sambar rasam and seal it of with curd mixed with rice:)The north indian food items are quite well done too
5
Best and authentic Andhra food in Singapore.. really felt happy.. everyone enjoyed my birthday treat at Sankranthi, Singapore... :)5 of our colleagues travelled to Singapore on business trip and we had our dinner almost everyday at Sankranthi, which tells how good we enjoyed the food..
5
This was my second visit to Sankranti.Had Veg Sabji Kadai with Roti and Masala papad.They have mastered the art of having the perfect combination of spices so that the taste tickles your tongue at the right spots Do visit this for an authentic Indian Meal.I would say it beats most of the local Indian restaurants .Bear in mind,if you are alone you will have to share a table as the restaurant is a average sized and there can be waiting during peak hours
5
I am a regular to their restaurant in Changi during my recent trips to Singapore... They have limited but good breakfast options, lunch buffet and alacarte for dinner... They serve Andhra and North Indian cuisine... My favourites were thier breakfast options, Bhojanam (limited meals) and phulkas... Friendly staff who will try to customize to your appetite... Order may take sometime if the place is crowded... You can place your order on phone but you have to collect it, no delivery... Closed on sunday..
3
Don't visit on weekday nights and order thali because you ll get stale food made in the morning and served for lunch.
4
This is famous for Andhra Cuisine located at 3 places.
The cost is reasonable for tiffin and South Indian Breakfast.
And expensive for Lunch and North Indian food.
Ambiance is good and people are friendly here.
Not much waiting time.
4
Great place for lunch. Good Indian fare for a fair price. I unfortunately only visited this place once, towards the end of my stay in Singapore.
3
Everything you order is average , having said that you would not be disappointed with most of the stuff you order. Biryani is good although I find the Buffet is very expensive for the quality of the food.
4
I like the variety here, Andhra, North Indian and Indian-Chinese Food. Food Quality is very good. Service is very slow. They need to improve this
1
The food was just ok. I been to this place with some hope to have a good south indian cuisine. We tried both veg and non-veg dishes and all our friends are very much disappointed. The food was heavily spice and spices used did not blend well with the elements. The place was too much crammed and uncomfortable
5
If you are an India foodie and do not wish to lose the taste of South Indian food when in Singapore, give this place a try and you will not be disappointed. The lunch here tastes just as the ones you get in a traditional south indian restaurant. The options are plenty and tastes great
4
For quite a few months, we had been trying to visit Sankranti restaurant to enjoy the biryani. However, every time long queues forced us to go back and look for other places. Out of 10 times that I visited the place with my family, we could eat only twice. Inspire of that I am quiet a fan of Sankranti restaurant at Little India. I love the mirchi bhajji and hyderabadi biryani both veg and non-veg. Only if they could improve the seating arrangement and make it more conducive for hungry customers by providing faster service, this place would be one of the best in town
5
Great food, variety and ambience,tech savvy!You get a free welcome drink. Cuisines: Andhra, North Indian and Chinese!Veg Manchow soup, Vegetable manchurian, Five vegetable gravy spicy(Chinese), and Duri Dolma (Mushroom and paneer) were great! Orders accepted through ipads at the tables. Good and timely service."Call the waiter" sent through the ipad didnt seem to catch their attention!Overall Enjoyable and satisfying experience!Tips: Go for an early dinner to enjoy faster service, else gets crowded
1
You ask for anything from the menu, the answer you get is "sry sir that is not available today". You end up having what they give you but not what you want. Its better to avoid this restaurant, vanabhojanam restaurant which is just adjacent to it is a better alternative.
4
I was here for dinner and lunch on couple of ocassions with friends. Food served here was great and taste was real good. A nice restaurant with andhra spice food. From starters to biryani, food was really good here.There is take away facility here.
5
We have dined at Sankranti a number of times and have found the food to be excellent. Their chicken biryani is one of the most authentic dishes I have found in Singapore. Their butter nan is also one of the best in country. The service needs to improve a bit in their CBP outlet though people don't seem to mind waiting. We once did not like the food we ordered and the manager at CBP personally spoke to us, understood our complaint and promised to pass on the message to the chef. Food isn't very expensive here! Costing upto sgd 20 per head at the most. Should definitely try this place
5
I eat regularly @ Sankranthi which is near to Mustafa Center. There are two more branches in Tampines & Changi Business park.I like Chicken Biryani and south Indian starters. Good ambiance and service. Prices are above average. Since its a small place, you need to wait for some time to be seated
4
The ambience here is pretty good !We were served a welcome drink which was refreshing . we ordered starter main course , roti and different curries ... excellent .... It was quick too ! The prices here are a few bucks less than other places but so is the quantity. It still enough for two people share a meal tho ! Quality I would rate better than nearby places in little India ! Would definitely recommend and visit again !
4
It is a new Indian restaurant in Biopolis. Overall it's a nice restaurant and they have a lot of customers during lunch time. During lunch they have thali. I tried North Indian roti thali and fried fish. The food was tasty in general but some of the food were a little too spicy and hot. So my recommendation would be to check with the staff about the spice level before ordering. They give a lot of food, so you'll never leave hungry.They have some typical Andhra dishes as well. It's a new restaurant with decent ambiance. I'll definitely return and bring my family for dinner
3
We have been to Sankrantri last sunday, was pretty crowded.. heard a lot about the place from many people but to my surprise the food was very Average, portions were very small, among all we ordered I think Gongura mutton was decent in taste, dint like natu kodi vepudu its like any other home made chicken curry, please dont order chilli chicken very less quantity and very very Average in taste I think you can find similar dish for 3$ in some food court, veg biryani was very dry, they dint have many dishes wr ordered so we had to go with what they had strangely, they dint have lime soda.. they said they were running out of limes very strange.Disappointed but may be if you like you can give a try.. I feel jungle tandoor or khansama has much better tasty food. I am never going back here again
5
Sankrati has opened outlets in many parts of Singapore. The choice and quality of food is the same in all the outlets. The service and courtesy are also uniform. The best thing about this group is that some branches are very busy and some not so busy.The personal touch is the same
5
Most people would associate the word cuisine with exotic or surreal food experiences. However, for me it simply means a place which I want to visit again and again.The first time I went to Sankranti was when a colleague recommended it as having the original mirchi bhajji like I used to eat from 'bandis' in Andhra whilst I stayed there.Visiting this restaurant was one of the nest decisions I took. The table will have ghee, 2 types of podi, gongura pickle and tomato chutney as a standard fixture. As to it the Sankranti special 'bhojanam' and you will be completely satisfied.I and my wife normally start with the bhajji, some chicken snack and finally main course (thaali or alacarte) based on how hungry we are.The customer service is very good, and the doorkeeper even looked after our shopping cart (loaded from shopping at Mustafa) while we eat.The value for money is amazing and two people can eat a good meal within 27-30$. I am amazed they can provide such good quality at such a reasonable price. While you are waiting for a table, or choosing the order he will serve you mango juice complimentary....isn't that great!!And my favourite aspect of this restaurant - my sensitive stomach does not react to the curry or spices and I do not feel bloating or discomfort like other Indian places.If you are choosing a place to eat Indian food in Singapore, you must try Sankranti. And don't forget the mirchi bhajji.....u will bless me for leading you there!!
5
I'm definitely not an authority of Indian food, but my friend/co-worker from the Andhra region said this was the real deal. Compared to some of the delicious Northern Indian cuisine in Chicago (around the Devon area), the food had an inherent and subtle (if not raging) spiciness and was more delicious! The beer was cold and refreshing, and the this was a nice resting place after a crazy (but enjoyable) visit to the Mustafa Centre
3
We wanted to sample food from Andhra region of India and walked in to Sankranti as their tag line advertised Andhra Cuisine. The choice of Andhra Food was very limited and the other items were a hotch potch of Northern Indian and Indian interpretation of Chinese food. We settled for the Thali which was average. tip: the restaurant has poor crowd control and if you go during peak hours you will have other patrons staring at you and crowding your table, very uncomfortable and unnerving
4
A must try if someone want to enjoy andhra cuisine. It is place wherein we get ghee, chilly powder and soe toher south indian powder to eat with the rice. The set worth around 9SGD is totally worth it. Can try biryani as well.
4
Great Andhra(South Indian) food in SIngapore. Even though we are from Tamil Nadu, We are also huge fans of Andhra Cusine We had typical Meals, Fish Fry and Chicken Biriyani. All were good, one of the best in Little India which was actually tasting Indian.
4
We ordered take away from Sankranti and i was my first experience tasting the food from there.

Sankranti (Opposite Mustafa Centre, Syed Alwi Road): A nice place to get Andhra food. Should try Local Chilli Fish

Great taste and loved chicken 65. It was authentic. We had vegetarian thali, it was awesome. Over crowded and little slow service but tasty food will make it up.

Great andhra food in Singapore! Though it's a bit costly, the taste compensates the extra cents we pay... Definitely good for people who love andhra and spicy food!

A friend of mine took me to this restaurant stating that the food is very good. We went a bit late, an hour before their closing time. We asked the waiter to give us what they had which was fresh. We were served with Shrimp Biriyani and a few other items. Midway through our meal we could smell that our biriyani was stale (spoilt). We did not want to make a scene. We finished our meal (remaining dishes) and we were going to pay for all the dishes (including the spoilt dish). While we were paying we mentioned to them about our dish. The waiter acknowledged that it was spoilt, and then started yelling at us for not letting them know earlier. We were not asking for a credit. We told them that she should not have offered us that dish. Bad attitude, even after acknowledging that the dish was spoilt. We are never going there again

Sankranti is a must visit restaurant if one wants to try out authentic Andhra recipes, both Veg and Non-Veg, snacks or meals. I like the courtesy extended by the staff, spread of the menu and overall value. The ambience is above average but the food taste compensates well! Must try snacks are Cut Mirchi and Punugulu!! The speed of service could improve, may be some more staff in the kitchen are needed. Overall it's a good place to visit with family and friends for authentic Andhra food

It is the worst ever hotel I have visited in Singapore. The ambience is bad, the taste of the food is horrible and the service is the worst. Never ever try to enter the hotel when u r in Serengoan Road and waste ur money and time

Enjoyed the authentic vegetarian food. The ambiance of the restaurant is average but food is good. It is just opposite Mustaffa centre hence you can enjoy shopping as well.

Nice authentic Andhra food in Singapore. Feel at home whenever I visit Singapore and have food in Sankranthi. The Thali both vegetarian and non vegetarian are good. It is centrally located in Little India.

It is a good place to eat Andhra cuisine, quite popular with locals too, am told it is a night mare on a weekend to get seats in this place.
They can improve the quality of the Mango juice they serve as complmentary

Wow we had a great andhra cuisine foods...I really loved the Bhojanam which has a rice with sambar, kuzhambu, poriyal,kootu,appalam,variety rice,curd,payasam, podi, kongura pickle, ghee, chutney. I loved that chutney they provide. They also have many variety of foods both veg and non-veg.such as Naan,phulka,briyani etc

Once you have shopped at Mustafa, head here for their chicken boneless biryani. We are yet to find better chicken biryani in Singapore. They have a green thokku curry which is a bit of dynamite. Amazing.Can't write more because we always end up ordering the chicken biryani!!Oh yes, and don't go there if you expect phenomenal service

If you are looking for some great indian food, vegetarian or non vegetarian head to Sankranti @ Little India , Singapore!Don't expect great ambiance but expect fabulous food. The Guddhu Paruthu an egg preparation starter is a must have and most of their chicken preparations are heavenly.The thali gives you a taste of typical andra food and if you dont mind indulging its the best one to try

Visited here for a dinner with my wife. Ordered malai kebab, dum biryani and dal tadka. It took them 40 minutes to serve kebab and biryani and another 30 mins for the dal by which i ran out of my patience and had to cancel the order. The staff acted very tech savvy taking orders on ipods but no one had any clue what was happenibg to the order.. They went on asking one another and kept running to the kitchen. The restaurant next door.. COPPER CHIMNEY is a much better alternative with a delicious food fast service and open kitchen. Only go if you like wasting alot of time..

Sankranti specialises in Andhra cuisine although other types of food is also available. In our recent family visit to Snigapor, we visited this hotel twice and we were very much satisfied with the food, quality and prices in each visit. The walls have beautiful pictures depicting Andhra culture. On the whole, you will have very good experience in this authenitc Andhra hotel

Sankaranti has many branches in Singapore . I went to the one on syed alwi road off serangoon road. The quality and quantity of the dishes are pretty good. You can even chill off with a cold beer as you eat. The staff are friendly and will spice down your food if requested
