The lovely team at Angel's Bistro closed the shop in November 2015. This space is now a refurbished organic clean-eating cafe/bistro, Kitchen by Food Rebel, serving healthy breakfast and lunch and some of the best fair-trade coffees in Singapore.

This is a decent choice if you're looking for simple vegetarian food at a reasonable price point. Don't expect anything too fancy, but the food is wholesome and tasty. Meals are prepared quickly and staff are friendly. And there's no MSG!

Tucked in one of the streets in CBD, this place is a hidden gem...serves amazing healthy vegetarian food, variety cuisines...the laksa here is the best I have eaten...not too expensive...an avg meal could come for about $10...
Must vist!

Good healthy laksa in an affordable price, especially for those who work in CBD area. The broth is not too heavy yet quite savory.

This is hands-down the best lunch experience I've had in the CBD in the 6 years I've worked here. The restaurant is run by and staffed with a cheerful bunch of retired people who offer excellent service. I found this place at a time when I had dietary restrictions that prevented me from eating gluten, dairy and eggs (intially, and as I discovered later, soya too). This was the ONLY place I could eat cooked food in an area that is packed with thousands of eateries! Their entire-menu is gluten-free and has plenty of vegan options as well. The owner is very knowledgeable about food and is conscious of the nutrition offered by ingredients that go into his food. I love this place and could eat here every afternoon

I visited this place on the recommendation of some colleagues, and I was sure glad I ate there. The owner greets just about everyone, and he was so helpful with working out some meals to eat there but also to take away to eat later. Not everything I ate was extraordinary, but the dishes that were good were really good. Definitely a high recommendation for vegetarians or people looking for reasonably priced and healthy food

I tried Angel's bistr√≤ because I was looking for a vegetarian restaurant; I was a little undecided because there were no photos in TripAdivisor and for me it's too important to see food's pictures.I went and what a beautiful surprise!The owner is really kind and nice, the place is nice and the service is very fast, they're perfect for lunch time! Unfortunately, it's open only for lunch time.The food is great!!! One of the Best vegetarian I've ever tried, but I really think the best!Portions are big and they offer a bottle of mineral water included in the price. Desserts are absolutely to try!Go and taste great food, even if you're not vegetarian

This is a hidden gem in Singapore CBD area, variety of Oriental, South east Asian, Japanese and western vegetarian organic food available here. Good taste, good portion and good quality. If you are looking for fine dining than this is not the place but recommended for usual daily meal

Being vegetarian trying local cuisines can be very challenging and I came across this place for lunch option. I enjoy whole range of food they serve from tom yum..mix veggie with brown rice..laska...tofu gyoza..claypot dessert and homemade drink. Ususally the lunch ranges from $7 to $ 10. They also serve breakfast. I would definately recommend this resturant
