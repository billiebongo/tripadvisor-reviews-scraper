Nice family place, my kids loved the pizza and the lovely crisp salads, wine selection also very good and reasonable prices, will visit soon!

The menu is not the same old same old that seems to be increasingly the case in many such places. Instead they have a number of different dishes that I for one appreciate. Food is generally good, and the service very good.

Situated in the Siglap vicinity is this agreeable establishment which serves up worthy fare and top notch service to boot, most enjoyable!

Craving for some dessert and ordered their strawberry cheesecake. Wasn't good. Not fresh and tasted like it had been in the fridge for a long time. Disappointing. Drinks are ok though.

Ok food good atmosphere and friendly staff, at a good price on Singapore standard. Will go there again.

Beer is decently priced. Asahi on tap is good.
Food is pricey. With kopitiams nearby, and fast food outlets around the corner, what you pay for here is service and comfy seats in an alfresco setting.

I have my wife visited on this restaurant while on my first Valentine Day Dinner after 18 years of marriage. It's was an nice environment, with nice music, and the food served was superb and most importantly my wife loved it so much and enjoying this wonderful dinner. Thanks

The food here is amazing, if you are into Tapas, pizzas, pastas, fajitas....Shrimp tacos has always been my favorite here! The chili cheesy fries and calamari are our favorite starters! Other than that, I have only tried the Carnivore pizzas and chicken fajitas as I never had a chance to try others because I kept coming back and ordering the same items! Lovely little place to hang-out after work and on the way home if you are staying around there. They have kiddie stuff like drawing paper and crayons, some books and little toys to keep the little ones entertained

I have been here a year ago, returned today and he the same impression - there is definitely something missing. Staff are friendly but the service is not quite sharp enough. With only three tables, everyone had to keep waving for service, it always needed to be asked for. With such a good location, a nice bar/layout and decent food I don't know how Mezza fails to get 5 stars but it definitely does

Nice, buzzy little place in Siglap. Best for after work drinks or dinner. It appeals to young and not so young expats and locals as a place to sit back and chit-chat. For 3 diners without alcohol or dessert, expect to pay around $S130 ++ We had seafood pasta, fish & chips, and burger with fries. But the fried calamari dish was tougher than a strong rubber band! Guess it was either over-cooked or re-heated. Perhaps, they could train their waiter to at least acknowledge a complaint, rather than just stand there looking uncomfortable. Apart from that, it does have a fun cafe vibe, good menu, and all the ingredients to continue doing well

The staff and owners have such hospitality. Food is yummy. The alfresco area rocks. The location is amazing. Only downfall is that I don't come here enough

Huge selection of food from around the world. Multi cuisine. High quality. Exceptional overall. The seafood, selection of meats and was too much to handle. Plan to spend at least 2 hours of serious eating!

we booked a table of eight last week at lunch: cosy venue, cool location, reasonable prices, friendly staff and tantalising food.
Unbelievable but true: a delightful lunch at $18.90 close to the East Coast...
We'll be back next Wedesday to enjoy the Ladies Night!

This is fourth times I come Mezza, one important thing I want to mention is their food quality is in very high standard. They can maintain same good taste and quality everytime. The services also keep in high standard. Their staff is always good. The price is also not expensive

Not content with reviews we listened to some good friends and popped into Ezza.8pm on a Wednesday and the place was filling up and what i liked was the unpretentious decor and friend friendly welcome.Its hard to find a slice of western food anywhere in Singapore that doesn't cost the earth but Ezza does it well.Menu is simple yet covers all the western bases and service to prompt and the food hot and well presented.If your after a good cheap meal with no bells and whistles then try this place you'll be very satisfied with what you find

It was Chinese NY week .. BUTat 1900 I dont expect some items in the menu to be finished .. let alone 3 things and the service staff not aware.No Fish, No Mussles, ok moving on.The Pork belly was not fresh, not crispy and cold but was served with a delightful sauceThe steak (medium) was very rare and was indeed not the tenderloin but a very cheap poor rib eye. Chips were half raw. Cocktail had little if any alcohol and the entire time had to endure a Filipino waitress / apparent manageress harass the kitchen staff loudly so all could here including expletives. The male staff were more polite but totally disinterested. While some have given great reviews I fail to understand this on the service and meals we were served. With so much competition around the area, it is best to spend money elsewhere and the owner take a serious look at what is going on and why.very disappointe

This place is round the corner from my house. The coffee used to be good but it is now terrible and they used to have paper and pencils for the kids. Not anymore. $28 for 2 lattes and 4 Babychinos ...list interest in the overlong menu. They've lost my custom

Excellent gourmet food served in a cosy and informal setting: sfaff friendly and knowledgeable, stylish but unpretentious setting, excellent selection of housepour wines as well as premium whites and reds from both the Old and the New World, creative mocktails and cocktails served throughout the night. Have you already been there? Check it out

Close to the East Coast, nestled in the trendy Siglap enclave, Mezza is reputed to be one of the coolest venues in the area.My companion and I arrived over an unusually overcast Singaporean afternoon.The waitress, friendly and efficient, showed us immediately to a lovely indoor table in the aircon.Within a minute we were served ice water even prior to browsing Mezza's extensive Mediterranean menu. We discussed the food menu along with the polite and attentive waitress whose knowledge of the ingredients used in the preparation of Mezza's main courses was truly remarkable.While enjoying our food, we noticed several friends and colleagues enjoying a laid back Mediterranean-style late lunch over chilled drinks and snacks, laptops on table and smiles on faces. Mezza's free wi-fi service is excellent, of course. The profusion of discerning island residents frequenting this restaurant is testament to Mezzaâ€™s quality and beauty.Plenty of staff bustled around, attending to every need. It was good to see that this restaurant does not scrimp on staff, unlike many restaurants that employ the bare minimum. You can often see these poor souls, literally running around desperately trying to do 10 things at once in between a stressed-out manager and bored-of-waiting clients. No such thing here at Mezza: Think fast and professional, front to back and top to bottom. Cheers, Jessica Thomson & Henry Wilkinso

Everything about Mezza on Nine was perfection. The food, the beer and wine collection and the service. We had dinner here on Sunday 1st June. All my friends had been here before and they recommended to try it.The service staff are delightful, pleasant and helpful. The food was excellent. We shared the Dellacasa, Buffalina Pizza, and I had tenderloin steak for my Mains, nicely cooked and presented!!! beat part of the meal, for me, had to be the dessert: Their home made cheese cake and Pannacotta simple but elegant and soooo good...Thank you Mezza, we will come back very often and recommend to my friends and family
