boat key is a one of the great area to be.many indian places here for dinner but cant find one great food i can call. but i enjoyed here with family
3
Nothing amazing, when we arrived all the staff was sleeping at the entrance of the restaurant :o the food is ok
5
We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner there we had the chicken tikka marsala and vegetable Brioni they were both very tasty the portions were generous the staff was very courteous and friendly
5
I had dinner at Maharajah's last week and the food really hit the spot! The butter chicken was tasty, flavourful and moist with the garlic naan being perfect accompaniment. Will definitely visit again.
5
Can’t go wrong at this place ! Dishes were reasonably priced and excellent customer service ! Food was delicious , especially the prawns . Would definitely go back there again .
5
one of the best indian restaurants in Singapore. I have been going there for many many years and the food has been amazing every single time.
not to be missed if you're in the area looking for good authentic indian food
5
We dropped in here in the afternoon and made an arrangement to come back at night. The staff were really friendly and helpful so we mentioned we would be back around 8pm. As it turns out we were slightly delayed but when we did arrive they were keen to give us the best table at the river. Unfortunately it was a little breezy so we opted for a table in the open but not on the river. The food was quite simply excellent and the drinks, normally overpriced were within an acceptable range. On top of everything else we got lovely popadoms and sauces to start and ice cream after our meal. If you happen to be in Boat Quay and want a curry, this is the No. 1 spot

From Perth Western Australia. Went to this Indian Restaurant for Valentine's dinner. Easy to get there by Train on downtown line. Food was very nice, ordered Chicken Korma and Chicken Tikka Masala. Very good quality chicken and healtjy curry. Nann and rice decent size for price. Only one wine served by glass. Around $9 each. Very nice and a decent amount in each glass. Staff very nice, I recommend book before go so can get a good table. Beautiful view of the Boat Quay. Remember 7%TAX and 10% service charge added on total. Would go again!
5
Because it looks like any of the other restaurants at the quai, we were surprised by the quality of both the service and the food at Maharajah.When taking our order, the staff helped us with suggestions. Not only have all of the customizations of our order been met but the taste of each of the dishes has just been perfect. I've eaten a lot of Indian food all around the world and this was definitely one of the most delicious (in my opinion). I would recommend the restaurant 100%
5
I had the pleasure of dining at the restaurant recently after walking by and found the location very convenient.Furthermore, the food was fantastic.The Prawn tandoori was my favourite along with the butter chicken.I found the naan to be the best I have eaten in Singapore.Since the first visit, I have been back 3 times.Highly recommend dinner here before heading out for drinks
5
I’ve been going to maharajah for ages. Their brand is trusted and the food is great.
Definitely order the Butter chicken + Nans + fish curry
Also great for snacks and drinks by Boat Quay river.

Very good North Indian Food on the backdrop of the Singapore waterfront. Friendly and fast service. Truly recommended for a nice night out. Pricing is as expected in Singapore...
4
We got this from trip advisor and it was a good choice
We went there with friends, we all enjoyed the food and would recommend it
4
Excellent food excellent location, given 4 stars as like everything in Singapore it's quite expensive. The food was lovely the staff excellent, the boss man was very nice, we will defiantly return
4
Had a very good diner; staff helped in making choices. Lot of food on the table. People were freindly and view was also very nice at night.
4
Had dinner twice here lately and had good food. Reasonable choices and ultimately food was very tasty and had an enjoyable evening on the Quay.
3
Visited for dinner early evening and great location on Boat QuayService was good and sat by the water which was goodFood is not cheap but worse still is very bland. Ordered lamb vindaloo, the meat was nice but the curry was pretty tasteless and certainly not spicey
5
We went for dinner late last Thursday. As the kitchen was was closing we were told to order quickly. We had butter chicken, lamb rogan josh, biryani and couple of naans. Food was amazing, although there were only 2 waiter on the floor going in and out from the restaurant, service was polite and great. Will definitely come back for curry haven
5
The four of us had visited this restaurant some years ago and we had been looking forward to returning.We weren't disappointed.Our meals were superb and the staff as efficient and friendly as before.We had a table outside by the water.A lovely relaxing way to spend our last night in Singapor
4
Food, service & views were all very good - even on a rainy evening!I had Rogon Josh & was pleased that the lamb was not chewy & stringy. The dish was nicely spiced.Prawns malabar was also well spiced & delicious!As with everything in Singapore food & a couple of beers were expensive
5
Great Indian food, great location overlooking the river. Visited many times and never been disappointed so far.
5
Every time in Singapore, this place is on the must do list. No exceptions. We are yet to find a better package. Excellent food and service. Alongside the river. Great place.
4
Had chicken Marsala with rice and man that was good. Yummy. Not huge portions, but friendly served on the outside. Nice view on the Singapore river.
5
Great spot to enjoy the canal and the view of the Raffles Hotel. The food was lovely and the service attentive. I went there with friends and had a good time.
5
Awesome Indian Food!!! Highly recommend this restaurant for Indian food!! Chicken tikka Marsala was amazing!!!
4
Don't come here if you're after a romantic dinner but the food is very good. The staff are courteous and quick and boat quay, whilst touristy is still a lovely setting at night. We had dinner here and although we couldn't get a seat outside as it was full we were given a good spot just inside which suited us fine as it was a particularly humid evening. Ordered the tandoori mixed grill which was cooked perfectly although I'd have preferred the fish not to have the light batter they put on it. Then we shared the chicken madras and it was amongst the best we've had. Beautifully cooked and very tasty but not oily. They could do with a decent wine list but other than that this is a good little restaurant at reasonable prices.
5
We went here on a recommendation, on arrival nothing was too much trouble and a waterside table was sourced as we waited.The service was attentive and polite, plus an slight alterations to the menu were no problem; we had a split naan which was cheese and chilli one side with garlic on the other, it was outstanding.Admittedly the portions did defeat us but the flavours were excellent, probably one of the best vindaloos I have had in a long time. Great setting and the bar opposite had reasonable live music going on through the evening. Certainly worth a visit
5
We ate inside, this restaurant is on the quay and does provide outdoor seating. Inside ambiance is ok, but the food was very good. We had the chicken tikka masala and chicken briyani. Both were fabulous. Generally food in Singapore is not particularly cheap when compared to Malaysia, but it is on par with going out to eat in California. We would so eat here again
4
Quite pricey but nice big portions and staff are really friendly. Went out of their way to get us a table next to the river then when we asked for a photo they took around 20 from different angles!Curry itself was really good - I'd recommend the lamb over chicken and the rice for two could feed 4. Would definitely go again if I fancied North Indian curry in Singapore
5
Think it is now about 20 years I have been eating at this establishment and whilst Boat Quay changes, the Maharajah does not. It has always been consistently good and my last the visit was no exception. It's always a good sign when you can't get a table because the place is so popular and this was the case the other week. No matter, papadoms and Beer was taken inside and as soon as somewhere became available I was ushered outside to watch the river and the World go by. Service was friendly & professional, food was excellent. Yes, you can go for a more traditional banana leaf curry in Keppel Road, but the Maharajah caters for all and for me, you can't beat it
5
Staff here looked after us very well, giving us a waterside table and attentive service. Samosas were very tasty and the meat curries were very tender . Very good value by Singapore standards. Recommended
3
Meat is dry for me, not so good, overcooked, rice and sauce is average but nothing special, but still good spicy in sauce, just the meat which for me is not really good, staff & service is OK,
5
Excellent venue, next to river in Boat Quay, staff extremely helpful and food is a delight. We enjoyed everything that we had.
5
A walk down Boat Quay to this restaurant is a busy walk but well worth it. We got to the restaurant and had not booked a table but they found us one on the Quay and on a Friday night. The food was very tasty and good portion we had a jug of beer cold and put in a bucket of ice to keep cold. You can sit inside or out it is a clean place and the restaurant staff are very helpful it is not a expensive restaurant for Singapore. I would definitely recommend it and I would go back
5
This is the second time I have eaten here with my 18 year old Son and the staff are so welcoming and personable it makes the whole experience worth while. The food has to be the best Indian meal I have had in Singapore or London. The depth of Flavours is fantastic and the food arrives in a timely manner, I could eat here every week, I can't over emphasise how good the food is
5
I have visited Maharajah a number of times over the years and the food and service remain as high class as every visit. The owner/manager does a wonderful job of making guests welcome, the location is perfect beside the Singapore river. Tiger beer served in pint glasses and at very reasonable prices compared to bars/venues nearby. The menu is varied and I must also mention the house red wine is excellent. The portion sizes are big and very tasty. Highly recommended from a lover of curries
5
Me and my husband had the best dining experience at Maharajah! Gorgeous view, sumptuous food, cool winds, river side table...... The owner was very courteous and got a special dish made for us, as he saw how confused we were on deciding what to eat.! And it was just wat we wanted.! The service too was top notch.. All in all, just perfect.
2
Came to Maharaja with very high expectations due to excellent reviews. We ordered tandoori fish, tandoori paneer, black dal and some bread. The fish and the paneer were not well marinated and lacked authentic Indian flavor. The paneer in particular was very disappointing. It was a busy night but the staff were polite and efficient. The location and outdoor seating area was great. At the end of the meal left disappointed with the food and the bill size.
5
Our family of 6 just had a fabulous meal at Maharajah. We are vegetarian and one of our kids has an onion and garlic intolerance. They were able to meet all of our needs with a great range of choices. This is a favourite restaurant of ours on Boat Quay.
5
Situated on the waterfront with nice views of the city. Small but excellent, both food and service of the highest standard. Cuisine is North Indian and is really genuine. Menu offers a good selection and price is reasonable.Tables outside on the waterside, but for those wishing to avoid the Singapore heat and humidity there are quite a few tables in an air conditioned room.Well worth visiting, this restaurant will be in my list of restaurants to come back to next time I'm in Singapore
5
One of the best places to entertain friends. Great food.. good views, especially in the evenings. Weekends definitely become pretty crowded, so I generally go there on weekday evenings mostly with business colleagues. Have been there on multiple occasions and had fun every time.
5
Really really tasty North Indian food. My recommendation as follows for a complete experience: Goa Fish curry, Lamb rogan josh, Aloo gobi, Paneer saag, Butter or garlic Naan, Kashmiri pillau. Friendly owner and staff!!
5
Fantastic restaurant. Never disappoints. I make this part of the calendar, for every trip to Singapore. Great place for dinner, at sunset. Good view of the Marina Bay Sands Laser Light Show. Excellent service. Terrific food. Enjoy!!!
5
Visited here during our recent visit to Singapore. Superb food and lovely friendly staff. recommend this place if you love your Indian food especially the lamb cooked to perfection
2
i have been this hotel for few times because food is decent. but i feel the behavior of the staff is very rude. last time when we went with our guests that guys rudely said closed, there was no courtesy for customer. everybody felt so offended with his behavior and we felt so embarassed in front of our guests
4
If you are hankering for a British Style Indian this is one of the best places I've come across, and one of the few places that serves Mango Chutney with the Poppadom's. Every dish I've tried there has been good but classically heavy, so you won't go home hungry
5
We went for dinner with the whole family with 3 kids brtween 12 and 16. We were welcomed greatly. They noticed our needs immediately and we were served in a very personal way. The food was so nice, even for the kids, who are not used to eat too spicy. The atmosphere completes the whole thing. Can really recommend this place
5
Great place for vegetarians, the selection left us wanting to come back and try more. We had the Malai Kofta and Paneer Butter Masala, both of which were excellent. Service was also great and the view does not disappoint. Will be back here whenever in Singapore.
4
Followed my TA nose, and looked out this little restaurant. We were quite early so plenty of room in this little place. Service was very good, having some guests with me that had not eaten Indian food before I asked the waiter to recommend our full meal. He did a great job and the food was excellent, showing a good knowledge of their food and what their customers would like. I will certainly go bac
5
We have eaten here several times now and never been disappointed. The food is always excellent and the chef will tailor to your own needs (handy for me not liking spicy food!) . The staff are so friendly and helpful and make us very welcome even from the first time we went. Special thanks for opening early for us with our guests on Sunday so we could enjoy dinner before the Grand Prix. We will be back very soon for sure and can't recommend highly enough
5
We loved dining here in the evenings. Sit outside by the river and watch the river boats go up and down while eating the MOST delicious indian food. No, seriously. Every dish here is totally delicious! Highly recommended.
5
The best chicken tikka masala you will eat. So tender and flavorsome. The Curries are also fantastic and everything is well priced, with a river view.
4
I went to this traditional restaurant many times over the last years. It seems that the management changed but the quality is still quite good.
5
Owner was very welcoming, looked after every table. Great food and great ambience. Will defo go back.
4
We came here for dinner on a weekend. For starters, we had the pakoda and the chicken samosa. The pakoda was a bit too spicy and the chicken samosa was very good. Before the starters arrived, the waiter served the pappadam with three different sauces. Just in time, our mains arrived. We had the lamb briyani and the curry chicken with cheese naan. The briyani was not too bad and not too spicy. However, the rice felt a bit hard. Cheese naan was a bit too cheesy and the curry chicken was good. Service was very good from the manager
4
Our starters - Hara Bhara Kabab was fresh and hot. Our drinks were nice, and rest of the food was delicious as well. Esp the Naans. The staff was friendly and helpful. This is one of the places I would recommend my friends if they want to try Indian food in SG. A bit on the expensive side, similar to most restaurants in Boat Quay
4
We were on the lookout of a good Indian restaurant during our stay in Singapore and nothing suffices your palette more than your staple food. Cravings of the day were typical - Butter Chicken and Dal Makhani. We decided to dine in at Maharajah and were taken by surprise as the food was exceptionally amazing! We did not have very high expectations in the first place but the food totally made our day! The service was prompt and I would highly recommend dining there! The steaming hot gulab jamuns were oh-so-good
5
Top quality food. Went with 5 others and the waiter got us drinks, starters and main meal without wring anything down - Top Class and the food was quickly served, hot and spicy. Well Done Maharajah - Note you get $10 each to spend next time. Setting excellent by the rive
3
A restaurant has two key attributes - food and service! In Maharajah, the service is very good...this makes up for any short coming in their food....however, not suggesting that there is anything wrong with their food...it jus seems a lot more ready made, when prawn curry is delivered within 5 minutes of being ordered...maybe other restaurants are making a big deal of it by serving late and Maharajah is being honest to customers...only time will tell...but so far so good
5
Excellent North Indian cuisine, friendly staff, brilliant service and a lovely relaxed atmosphere! We had a riverside table, which was the perfect place to enjoy a few cold beers with delicious Indian food as the sunset on a warm Singapore evening. The food was amazing! Each dish was a perfect combination of spices and flavours! We absolutely loved the whole experience and will definitely be back for dinner on our next visit to Singapore! Thank you
5
Excellent Indian food. The staff is really good and friendly. The service is quick and food tastes delicious. Best Indian food we had so far in Singapore. We have an amazing dinner by the river. Thumbs Up !
5
We have eaten at the Maharajah on previous trips to Singapore and this restaurant never disappoints. For over 25 tears it has provided a high standard of excellent Indian curries(our preference) friendly service and competitive pricing. Our first choice for our first dinner in Singapore
4
Great starters both tandoori chicken and their samosas, and the main courses are not bad either. Very friendly staff and Kingfisher beer round off probably one of the best curry restaurants in Singapore.
5
We love this place. First of all the staff are so nice - we had to change our timing three times but they were patient and accommodating. On arrival they had saved our riverside table (lovely view and cool breeze), the food arrived quickly and everything was delicious. We appreciated the complimentary ice cream and the money off vouchers for our next visit (soon I hope!) A real gem in Singapore
5
Good menue, good service and good location. The staff were helpful in suggesting we ordered less starters and just shared. When was the last time anyone did that in a resturant. It was busy with locals which is always a good sign. Passes my test I would go back again
5
Not for those looking for sophistication or elegance - but definitely for those who want a damned good curry and a hearty welcome. We had a tandoori fish starter to share followed by lamb korma, saag paneer, dal makhani and garlic naan. All delicious! Amajit runs a great little restaurant by the water with outside eating next to the water. Definitely recommended. Go see the laser show, pop in for dinner and then spend SGD30+ for a drink on top of One Raffles Place
5
As you walk along the Singapore river restaurant district, all of the restaurants have aggressive touts -- except one: the Maharaja. The most aggressive approach you'll hear from them is a pleasant "good evening" and a nod of the head. The staff are conservative, well-dressed, and respectful. It's like the Maharaja is from a different place and time, even though visually it is identical to all the other riverfront restaurants.The food is wonderful traditional North Indian food, including a full vegetarian menu in addition to a wide variety of meet curries. The naan is good, the service is good, and the curries are excellent. Highly recommended.Book ahead for seats right on the river, especially Friday and Saturday nights
4
We are a regular visitor to this place. Relatives visit us often and we plan one dinner here...because of guaranteed good taste, location (overlooking a river), ambiance and overall feel.We have tried numerous options on the menu till now. Tandoori roti and Yellow dal is always ordered. All dishes are authentic is taste and we had great outing till now. Servers are gentle and well mannered.We prefer to get the corner table close to river but most of the times it is occupied!Highly recommended for the Indian food, Lassi and Chai too!!! So long as the taste remains good, we would continue to visit
5
My wife and I have been paying this restaurant a weekly visit for a full year now and not once have we been disappointed with either the food or the service. We have covered most of the menu by now and I would be hard pressed to call out our favorite. It is quite rare to find a restaurant showing this level of consistency in quality and taste. It is not a cheap eatery but worth it compared to the many overpriced restaurants in Singapore... Every city we have lived in had its favorite restaurant and Maharajah will be the one for Singapore..
5
Ate dinner with friends at this place. We shared various dishes and the food was very nice. Despite it is area with lots of tourists, we felt hre like beeing somewhere in India - food was served very quickly and the waiters were very attentive. If one goes in the at around 7 pm or so, one will see the boat traffice circulating on the river. A place we really like and shall return
3
The daal makhni was just superb plus the aam ka murabba they give u with papad is just great....better to go on Friday or sat evening to enjoy the boat quay culture
5
Excellant service, excellent food, great location. This place is exceptionally well run. The staff work really well to ensure that you have a lovely time. I would recommend this place to anyone
4
We went out for dinner yesterday night and enjoyed the food. It was little spicy but nice authentic specially the paneer butter masala. Quick service as well !!
4
Nicely located aside of Singapore river at Boat Quay. Food is very good, especially various types of curry available. Price is a bit expensive but judging from a lot of customers, I believe this restaurant is very popular.
3
Overall food is quite average. Not really authentic taste.They serve complimentary papad with chutney which is nice.For starter we ordered Hara kabab (Veg) which was tasty. Then come main course, Paneer makhani was a disaster. They put processed grated cheese on top as garnish.Lamb bhuna was just ok, nothing special. Serving for white rice was huge and masala chai good.Service was with smile, polite and prompt
4
Four of us had lunch at Maharajah because we had a good meal at Orchard Maharajah several years ago so we trusted this location. We were given a lovely table at the river's edge at about 12:20 pm on a weekday. We felt that the butter and cheese naan were thinner than at some of our other favorite restaurants. The prawn tandoori and butter chicken were excellent. We remarked at the time how relaxing it felt to enjoy Maharajah's delicious food, the view of the river, and the cooling summer breeze, all at the same time. Service was excellent, and the price was commensurate with the close-to-downtown location and quality of the food
3
The location of this restaurant is awesome. The food is great. But they have a recurring habit of overcharging. I ate there last year and was over charged by about 20% and wrote it off as a one off. Then the same happened again in May so this beautiful but costly restaurant has been shifted from the list of places to eat in Singapore
4
We returned to Singapore after a couple of days in KL and wanted to try an "Indian" on Boat Quay. We stumbled upon this restaurant because is looked quite busy, which I always find a good sign. We were not disappointed, the service was very good and food better. We recommend the Balti Chicken and Lamb Jhalfrazie washed down with a large bottle of Kingfisher.Good value - well done
5
Having diner at their other outlet a few days ago we were a little surprised to see another outlet whilst walking down boat quay. After whipping out my trusty smartphone to confirm we sat down for a quick lunch this time. The standard of the food is really quite good and the taste was very similar to what we had just experienced a few days previously (a good thing). Other than that not much else to say rather than the the view from the riverside is a better. Service was pleasant as we expected. Hope to see you guys again on our next trip
4
This is an odd one to review so I will start with a conclusion. This was a nice place to eat, next to the water, with great food and great service.What it wasn't was different to a hundred and one curries I have eaten back in the UK over the years. Had it not been for the nice weather and riverside view, I could have just as easily been in Birmingham.For years people have kept telling me that when in the UK, the curry you get in UK curry houses is not like you get back in India. That a lot of the dishes would not be recognised by a real Indian person etc etc.So whilst this was Singapore not India I was expecting something more "authentic". What I got was an instantly recognisable menu with good old "British" dishes just like I can find back home in the UK. They were however really well cooked and full of flavour. Indeed I have never gotten excited over a Chicken Tikka Starter before.As I said, it was good food with good service just not the authentic stuff I was expecting
5
Great staff that love talking cricket to go with a great chicken vindaloo! To add to that, the view was great and you can tell a good restaurant by the patrons sitting and enjoying the food and service.
5
We were a party of 6 and we could not ask for better service. We had a great selection of food to share with garlic and pheswari nan breads and rice.
Staff extremely friendly and we will be back.
5
Very delicious food and a friendly and efficient service. You get chips and nice salsas as an appetizer. Highly recommended.
4
The atmosphere was cool. Boat quay is a good evening pass time and favourite too. Food was fresh and authentic Indian Flavour. Service was fast. Staff was very co-operative
4
We visited the Maharajah based on previous reviews, and we were certainly not disappointed. Waitress helped us with some recommendations and both dishes and the naan bread were terrific. Great spot by the riverside for a pleasant evening, too.
4
I visited this restaurant with my family looking for Indian Vegetarian food. Taste wise the food was good, service was quite quick. We sat in the open area, so the ambience was good. It's better to sit outside as the main hall interiors are quite old and shabby. So, for a decent dining experience with Indian food, one can visit this restaurant. No comments about drinks, non-veg food and desserts as we haven't had any.
4
We visited this place for lunch on a weekday. There were not many people and we were able to get the table next to riverside very easily. The service was quick. The food was good. We tried butter naan & garlic naan with Malai Kofta as the gravy. All 3 items were good. The quantity was also nice. In the starters we tried Hara kabab which was also good. Finally the deserts we tried Kulfi and Gulab Jamun. We liked the taste of both these items. Overall we liked the feel of this place. We will definitely return to this place in future. The price of dishes which many other reviewers have rated as on the higher side, i would say is well worth its price. Given the location of this place in the heart of tourist activity, i felt it was reasonably priced.
4
Visited here on our first night in Singapore. We craved a decent Indian meal after two weeks of Chinese food and we weren't disappointed. The service was efficient and the food was very good. Decent portions, very tasty and good value. The whole atmosphere of Boat Quay is brilliant so you can't go wrong location-wise
1
First time here, food great but slightly pricey even for normal white rice. My friend and i had the river side table for 2 hours and we were still having our food. The waiter came over and instruct us to leave as we had the table for too long but there isn't any customers waiting in line anyway. I cannot believe such things happened. We ignored them as we haven pay our bills and still munching our food. NEVER GOING TO RECOMMEND TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND NEVER GOING TO VISIT AGAIN
5
Had Dinner last night after reading reviews on TripAdvisor - all I can say is a big Thank You to everyone who has written reviews so that we tried this great restaurant, food & staff were both amazing hope to go again tomorrow our last night on Singapore
4
Takeaway curry from Maharajah was good (if a little greasier than hoped for) This is not a posh curry restaurant, but the food was well prepared and extra spicy where requested.
5
we ate here on our short stay in Singapore. The food here is excellent and location on the waterfront of Boat Quay delightful. Good quality without the prices of a more formal restaurant. Highly recommended
5
The food here is wonderful. Had the Goa fish curry with two different types of Nan bread. Everything was delicious and obviously prepared with special flare. The service was also exceptional.
4
Had lunch their today - Lamb Bhunna! Good wholesome Northern Indian curry, service was good and price was OK by Singapore standards. Recommend it and will go back....
4
Set on Boat Quay and not be confused with North Indian Cuisine the Maharajah was great. Food very tasty and service very good - we'll definitely be regulars.
4
We are a couple in the mid if 30s and we had a dinner there a few days ago. If you are after good indian food, then you will be happy there. The view is soooo fantastic. One of the restaurant we both would go for dinner again, so a recommendation
3
Have been here before but the recent visit was disappointing. It took 6 of us voicing out and 30 mins just to get water. Inside was not clean. Vegetarian food was good but non-veg was very ordinary. Chicek vindaloo was gravy and chicken tikka inside. Even fish was not that good, a fishy smell that made us loose apetitie. Chilly paneer is definitely good. Service could do with a lot more improvement.
4
I know many Indian Restaurants around the world. This is a good one. Not an outstanding and high class one, but good. I have always liked Boat Quay because you can sit at the waterfront and the scenery is quite nice. Of course it is a bit touristy but I never found it that bad. So if you like a good Indian meal in a nice environment, this is a place to try. If I am in town again and happen to be in the mood for an Indian dinner, I will not hesitate to return
5
We have been to Singapore for the first time and wanted to go out for dinner @ the "Boat Quay" district. Using Tripadvisor we found this nice Indian restaurant in this area (there are a lot of options, so difficult to decide withour any help) and were pleased with the food and the service.We tried several starters and curries- the food was delicious and our special requests (not too spicy, dishes without dairy products and eggs) were properly handled by the service staff
5
I try to make a point of visiting the Maharajah every time I visit Singapore. It's been consistently good for about 15 years. The welcome is always warm, the service is always excellent without being over-bearing, and the food is always really good. Boat Quay is a bit of a clichÃ© for tourists and ex-pats, and you pay for the location, but if you're in the area and you like good Indian food, this is certainly the place to go
5
The food was outstanding and plentiful. Not cheap but coming from Perth, Australia where curry is not a cheap night out (as it is in the UK) we found the price ok. Highly recommend the fish tikka starter.
4
Recently had dinner at Maharajah and the food and service was fantastic.
I did however find that the medium spicy wasn't very spicy, so I'd recommend that if you like spicy food, choose hot or extra hot
4
A friend invited us ahead of our dinner for a couple of snacks to this place at the Boat Quay. We have been several times at the Boat Quai - but it was the first time we ate something there. We were not disappointed. Our friend had ordered several very nice snacks and we really enjoyed the. This is certainly a place we can recommend for Indian food
4
We got to the restaurant early, about 6 pm, in order to secure a water side table. Both the entrees we ordered - the Punjabi Chicken Curry and Chicken Tikka -- were well prepared and tasted great. The Tandoori Roti came to the table nice and hot! Service was attentive and prompt. Water glasses were always full. The meal itself was on the expensive side but well worth it considering the quality of the food and water front atmosphere. We will return
5
I make a point of coming here every time I am in Singapore, usually once a year. The staff are incredibly friendly and always greet me and my family with a smile. The food is second to none, and the portion sizes are very good. I have been coming here for ten years (initially went to the one on cucusdaden road). I'm looking forward to my next trip
4
Goan Fish Curry was a treat. Service was excellent and not a bad price. Was very busy and lively but we were served promptly and the food was very tasty. Great view of the riverside and Marina Bay area. If you are there at the right time, you can catch the laser show from the Sands hotel
4
We are here last night and after an eventful time finding it (there are a LOT of restaurants along Boat Quay) we settled in for some delicious curries and breads. The service was attentive, and you just need to accept the fact that eating curry outside in Singapore is a sweaty business!!

I had not visited Singapore for 4 years, I was so glad to find Maharajah still in the same place, I ate here 4 nights out of my 5 nights stay. Excellent service, food, location and what a great man Mr Singh is, always makes you feel so welcome. A jolly nice pint of tiger beer too. I tried the lamb tika for a change, I was hooked, it is a must try, thick, juicy tender chunks of meat, all the portions are a good size and lovely and hot when served. There is outside and indoor seating

We had an excellent meal and experience at Maharajah. The service was outstanding and everything we tried was delicious. I was not a huge fan of Indian cuisine before trying this restaurant, but this restaurant changed all that! Even went back for a second visit and would return again. Well-done!

We were so impressed with the quality of food and service at this restaurant that we ate here twice during a 5 night break in Singapore. Upon taking our seats, with a beautiful view of Boat Quay, we were presented with complimentary mini poppodums and chutney, which we nibbled on whilst pondering the menu. The curries can be made to your taste, i.e. as hot or mild as you like. They tend to make them hotter than in English restaurants, so requested a milder version of the chicken tikka masala, which was lovely and just right in spice. There was lots of chicken and the pilau rice potion was sufficient for two. The staff were attentive and pleasant. Highly recommended if you enjoy Indian food
