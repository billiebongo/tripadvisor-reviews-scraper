Service was quick and efficient. The beef salami pizza was delish and so was the prosciutto ravioli and the antipasto platter. A little pricey for this neighbourhood restaurant though. $80 for two, without counting the drinks.

Friendly place. Standard Italian cuisine served very hot. Good place for a less formal family get together. Would return.

Best Italian restaurant in Singapore! More people should come here! It is very family friendly, nice staff, and amazing food (try the dried tomato chicken pasta, you won't regret it). Also, fantastic wine straight from Italy!

My penne amatriciana was delicious. Rich, smoky bacon and sweet onion and tomato flavors. My porcini pizza was also good. I like the thin crust style.Patchy service was the main detract Ion (and the tragically bad background music), but this was not so bad as to prevent me from returning for the food

Celebrated Husband's bday in this quaint restaurant run by Japanese. Impeccable service from all the staff. Food was delicious. It was not full on weekday but throng by regular Japanese customers, says a lot about this place which has been in operation more than 10 years.

Good food. Good service. Fair prices. However, restaurant is too noisy when one or two diners start talking. Some diners just do not care that their voice is the only voice in the whole restaurant. We had starters, pasta and main course of veal. All very well made and good taste. One more problem. Everyone seems to get a few slices of bread except our table. Not sure why and did not bother to ask as we were not looking to eat bread

We ordered a pizza, the potato gnocchi in tomato sauce, spaghetti, and garlic bread as the appetizer. This was more than enough for two adults and two teenagers, and I felt that the serving sizes were not bad. Bread with some very tasty French butter was also given, slightly ironic as it was an Italian restaurant! The pizza was very well made and cooked, yet I don`t think it was anything really innovative or new. But that didn`t pose a problem, as it was rather tasty which is what truly matters. The spaghetti was also pretty good, but the vegetables in it needed some work- they were a bit bland. A bit of salt livened up the dish considerably. The gnocchi was the strangest dish of all. Its sauce was excellent, but the actual potato bits had no flavor and wildly variable texture. I recommend eating this dish with a spoon so you get some of the sauce with every bite. In my opinion, this dish was a hit and miss. The garlic bread was very good, and was in an interesting shape- triangles! So it resembled Indian naan in this aspect.  Service was professional and friendly; there was nothing lacking. The ambiance was soft and tasteful with white linen tablecloths. A final note: this place has a lot of options for vegetarians

Came here with my wife for a quiet meal after work. Service was slow but the food eventually arrived. The pizza was very ordinary and the "veal scaloppine" that I ordered looked great but was raw inside. It was reminiscent of the way I'd seen frozen meat deep fat fried to thaw it then finished off in a pan. Anyway, I pointed this out to the waiter. They took it back to the kitchen and it came back in exactly the same state (even microwaving it would have at least cooked it!!).....but worse, the gristle and bits of burnt rosemary that I'd piled to the side of my plate were still there when it came back from the kitchen. If you'd just had a plate returned, surely your goal would be to represent the plate in the best way possible...but no, just handed it back with the offcuts still laying about and without even another spoon of sauce. There's a very nice Italian about 25 metres away in the same run of shops. That's where we'll be going next time

All the dishes we ordered we really good... tasty, presented well & good portions !! Great value given how many other restaurants are charging like crazy in SG these days. Very friendly & attentive staff. We will surely be back - and make this a regular !

It was our first time in this restaurant and it was worth the visit. The meals were very delicious. We were a party of six and order pizzas, lasagna, squid ink linguini, some appetizers and desserts and everything was tasty. The pasta was al dente and food was not salty or with too much condiments. It was perfect. The bill was around SGD 45 per head for all this food and included a carafe of house red wine. You will not be disappointed. If you are around Bukit Timah neighbourhood, go for it. If you go with a large party, it's recommended making a reservatio
