What's there not to love about Wanna Cuppa? The proprietress is lovely, the ambience is lovely, the food and drinks are lovely, and we love the good value set lunch options. Such a neat little place, and one of our favourites.

Love the lamb and beef!
It was super delicious and the portions were generous. Location is convenient and really a hidden gem in Clarke Quay

Went for dinner with my family. Ordered beef cheek, pork and sea bass meals. All good and particularly like the sea bass

We recently visited this cafe whilst in Singapore. The coffee was probably the best we tasted in Singapore. Breakfast was also really good and the service was fantastic. Would definitely recommend for coffee and breakfast.

Food: Tasty and reasonably priced.
Location: Sheltered all the way from Clarke Quay MRT (it was raining but we didn't need an umbrella)
Service: Helpful :)
Prices: Nett of GST and service charge
It was a cosy evening with friends. Will visit it again!

We had scrambled eggs and eggs royale. Both servings were perfect! It was evident that the service crew were dedicated and passionate about their product offerings. We'll definitely return.

It was a friday night and i was looking for a place to drink tea after dinner. This place was right opposite clark quay central but it was not crowded. I only had the chai latte as food was no longer available when i got in at 10 pm. Overall lovely quiet atmosphere. Decor was more english style with soft jazzy music at the background. Hope this place continues in the competitive cafe scene.

The ambiance was good, very quiet.. but the food portion was small, had to wait more than 45 mins for food to arrive despite only having 3 tables in the restaurant (but yes, our table had 7 pax) and price is >$20 per person. Personally I would not visit again as there are better choices out there. The staff's service was fine

We visited early on Christmas morning with our family who spent Xmas in Singapore. We thought nothing much got be open but to our delight we found Wanna Cuppa from Trip Advisor reviews and had a great meal together with great food and coffee. Host was lovely and made us feel ver welcome for all 12 of us.

First time at Wanna Cuppa. Needed a quiet space for a meeting nearby South Bridge Road and came upon this. What a surprise this place was. Hospitable staff, nice ambience, we came at 6 so it was still pretty quiet and we enjoyed the selection of jazz tunes which complimented the place very well. We only wished that our waiter could at the very least understand and talk to us as when asked which he would recommend out of two options, he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand at all. The wait staff though hospitable were a bit tense which gave the impression that we overstayed our welcome as soon as we finished our meal.

Located opposite The Central, Wanna Cuppa is a nice place to chill. Love the ambience. Set lunch offered good value, and the service is friendly. A good spot to unwind!
5
Pretty cafe(: peaceful atmosphere. Excellent service. Food was alright. Enjoyed our afternoon thereðŸ˜Š
5
Stopped in for breakfast and was amazed at the quality of the food and coffee. Nice music that wasn't to loud. Quick efficient service and acceptably priced.
So good I came back for breakfast the next day.
5
Nice pot of camomile with mint tea.
Delicious seafood platter, unforgettable crabby pasta, big portion of fish & chips, lastly marvelous taste of ondeh ondeh cake...lovely ambience cafe...we will be back again soon!

Love the interior decor and the music. A chill place to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. The food was decent and the coffee was excellent.
4
This is a pretty new cafe, though the crowd is pretty little, but I'm sure it will get better.
Love the food, very nice! Try the truffle spaghetti!
3
Food and drinks are very good. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is chill.But the price for everything is just too expensive. Short breakfast for 30 SD is too much
3
I do not like the interior design of this place, when it is crowded... it is extremely noisy. Was there for lunch, food is alright but lunch set pricing is pretty attractive.Staffs service still need to improve on. One of server hands wasn't very stable, when he was serving us soups his hands seem to be shaking. Honestly I was afraid he might accidentally drop it and have it all over me

Was looking for somewhere to have breckfast and came across Wanna cupola, what a find. Lovely little bistro, spotlessly clean, excellent food and great service. I had scrambled egg on toast and my husband had poached eggs on toast, delicious. Jazz music is playing softly in the background to enhance the ambience. Liked it so much went back for lunch a couple of days later. Would definatley recommend

Want to have a quick lunch with my wife around Clarke Quay area, and discover this cafe via the Entertainer App. The ambiance is relaxing and soothing, Warm lights, comfortable chairs, and potted trees in the cafe really sets the comfortable mood for a relaxing lunch getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life. Coffe and pasta are good and we came back again in 3 days time! Good service from the staff, we are pleased with the whole place.If u are working in the area and want to quiet place to pause at mid-day. Look no further
5
We ordered the lamb rack and truffle mushroom pasta , both items are very Gd . Portions are generous as well . Love the service from the lady boss as well :)
Will definitely return to try more of the mains !
5
Love the chilled out feel of this place, smooth jazz playing as you sip a great coffee and tuck into food which has been made with TLC, staff very attentive and friendly
5
Just stopped off for a quick bite around Clarke quay. Best chicken wings I've had in my entire life.
4
This cafe was close to our hotel at Clarke Quay and we visited it only once. What a shame! I would have gone there every day as the food was delicious.Very British in its set up but with multicultural food. Wish I had tried more.
4
Second time back here and it's an absolute hidden gem. It's a great place to unwind and chill with old buddies over some coffee or wine. Food is decent, nothing to rave about. But the entire ambience (jazz music all night long!) makes for a great night out
4
Great little find! We had a really enjoyable breakfast in this lovely space. The staff were very friendly and helpful and as we discussed with them at the time just needed a couple more breakfast options such as muesli and fruit. They assured us they were definitely looking at adding that to their menu

Singapore can be a tough place to get a good western breakfast. We tried Wanna Cuppa just trying to get lucky... what we ended up with was a really good latte, and some $12 pancakes that fell far short. While I am loathe to say this - we could have gotten far better value from McDonalds. Three small, very plain pancakes with a tiny side of syrup, and not particularly impressive taste-wise. The other breakfasts (we had French toast and eggs Benedict) were also nothing to write home about. Not to say they were bad - just very average. For the price, I would expect better
5
This is a great little cafe and has a great atmosphere. Hidden a little, but worth finding just across from the bus stop. Breakfast with coffee was excellent, and the staff are very welcoming and efficient. Quirky toilets if that matters. Music in the cafe a pleasant change. Opens early enough for breakfast if wanting to avoid the local hotels and their cost. Needs an extended breakfast menu to include fresh fruit and muesli-type meals. Other 'egg' meals are good however, with the vegetable pot (with eggs) being the best
4
Amazed by the lack of options for breakfast around Clarke Quay we came across this place and coerced by another review about the coffee gave it a shot. Coffee reviewer was spot on; best coffee I've had in Singapore. Small selection of egg dishes for brunch coupled with pancakes. Pancakes were light and not too sweet.
4
If you think Starbucks sells good coffee then this place is not for you! I was in Singapore and found this awesome coffee shop by accident during a torrential downpour. The staff were friendly, the ambience cool and chilled and best of all, it served excellent full bodied coffee not the water-downed stuff at Starbucks across the road
4
A nice quiet cafe, pretty good coffee and a really awesome bacon egg-cup - really cool.
The bacon was made into a cup, with the egg in it - cool as !
5
Great atmosphere for working or eating, excellent coffee and food, fast and friendly service too... would definitely come back :)
4
Tasty simple breakfast at very reasonable prices. Eggs Benedict served on focaccia was a nice change, tasty! Coffee was good and service friendly!
4
Only a small place, but pop in for a refreshing brew. Also offering a range of cakes as well as a brunch menu. Toilets clean and service good. Recommended!

I popped over to Singapore for the weekend whilst on business in Kuala Lumpur. The one 'must do' visit was to Wanna Cuppa. After my first visit in January 2016 (see my full, detailed review) I just had to return. No disappointment, the Eggs Benedict & cafe latte were superb (as I expected). The only disappointment was that you not there to say hello to Jeannette. So glad that Wanna Cuppa continues to thrive & you continue to receive great reviews. Maybe catch up next time. Take care.

I'm one of those people who figures out their life over a good cup of coffee at some cafe so ambiance is important to me. This place has it. 1920s inspired design and soft enjoyable music to compliment that. Wonderful place to be alone and enjoy a peace of mind. Or quite the opposite, it also serves as a great place for groups. The coffee is well made and each cup is served with a complimentary biscuit/cookie. Much appreciated. I've only tried a few food items so far and they've been great. Service is okay depending on who is working. I really don't have any complaints about this place as I do really love it. I guess my only critique or rather piece of advice would be maybe extending the breakfast menu a little more past 11? The menu gets a little slim after that point in time. I think this place would be even more popular during those in between hours if brunch was an option. Breakfast currently ends at 11am sharp. Who doesn't love afternoon eggs? :) I know I don't stand alone when I say I do, so maybe it's a thought for the future. Other than that, I adore this cafe and would definitely recommend it.

Nice to be able to discover a cafe that does a reasonable brunch. The staff who I assume we're the owners were very friendly and accomodating. I was surprised with the coffee which I thought was quite nice.Good food and is bookmarked to visit again in the future

Very friendly staff and a nice cozy setup. The menu and dishes were basic but the coffee was really good. The main downside was the speed of the service. Would return again.

Stumbled across this lovely cafe/restaurant tucked away on a Main Street in Singapore and have been back every morning for breakfast.From across the road, look up and see the welcoming sign, descend a couple of steps and enter. Polite, friendly and very accommodating staff who listen to your requests and produce a culinary delight. The chef is friendly and answers questions.The Egg Cup is ideal for gluten-free.The coffees are fresh, milk is perfect, ratio is balanced.I have been 3 mornings in a row now whilst visiting Singapore.Do yourself a favour-try this quaint cafe/restaurant
5
We visited on a whim having past on the way to our hotel. The eggs florentine were divine and a good sized pot of tea. It's pricey but I think that was because we had just come from Asia so probably a shock to us more than anything.
5
Recommended by my sister who has been raving about this place. One of the Best Egg Royale in sg; Attentive Service with a big smile. Great ambiance
5
Wanna Cuppa is by far the best place for coffee and breakfast that we found during 9 day stay in Clarke quay area, staff are very friendly and accommodating for our young children.
5
found this place on our last morning in Singapore. Great food and coffee. Friendly staff - just wished I'd had room for the delicious looking cakes.
5
The scramble eggs were wonderful ! The place is amazing and the cofee is wonderful !!
Cakes are really good. They need to advertise this place much better !!
4
Very modest from the outside, but inside it is a feast for the eyes and tummy. Counter service with a good range of breakfast and lunch items, cakes, coffee and teas.I tried the eggs Florentine, which I fully recommend.The decor and music are from the 20s era, with a modern twist.Situated just a stone's throw from the trendy Clarke quay, this is a quiet, peaceful place for a morning coffee
3
A good location and great food are important factors that contribute to an establishment's success. Service is another important factor and every establishment could do with a little improvement given the tough competition.The decor is impressive, wallpaper adorned the walls and tables and seats aplenty filled up the floor space. A feeling of welcome was lacking when I entered the cafe though the gentleman behind the counter quickly made up for it with his conversational skills. I was not led to a table but fortunately, the cafe was not busy.I only had cake and tea but I will return for mains next time

Had a Coco Chanel, Earl Grey Choc (cakes) and a Chai Latte to wrap up the evening. The cakes, nice to look at; was slightly dry. Perhaps they have been exposed for a while. The staff could have been more enthusiastic when welcoming me into the cafe
5
We decided against purchasing hotel buffet breakfast throughout our stay in Singapore, we had various other fast foods breakfasts, Starbucks etc, until we discovered WANNA CUPPA.. The staff were amazing with our 2yr old daughter & 7 mth old son. Plastic plate & cutlery was provided for our daughter. She absolutely loved her scrambled eggs & her babycunio :). Coffee & cold drinks are excellent too. We might even be back before we leave
5
Small and chic little place on the main road. We walked in to a very welcoming environment and staff was more than accommodating to let us choose from both the brekkie and lunch menus given we walked in just after start of lunch. Coffee was amazing and really strong. Ambiance is light and there were a couple of travelpreneurs working. Food was really good and simple pack with heaps of flavour. Loved the beef rendang pie - worth every bit

I came here for a quick breakfast on a Saturday morning. The coffee was great and my breakfast of scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and toast was both delicious and reasonably priced. I was able to do some work as well because of the free Wi-Fi. I would recommend going.
