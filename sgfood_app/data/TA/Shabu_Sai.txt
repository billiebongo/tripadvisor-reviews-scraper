This is one of the few restaurant that actually doesn't charge extra for the collagen soup base and they actually have a wide range of meat and stuff to go with the base. The food are above average but one point is the lack of variety. There aren't any fruits, or cooked food though. Most of the require you to cook them.But there is ice-cream though. I had a enjoyable lunch her

My absolute go to place for excellent Shabu without burning a hole in the pocket! I usually take the all-you-can-eat meat option during lunch hours at this Eastpoint Mall outlet. Lunch hours here are 11:30am to 5:00pm! For $14.99 for 70 minutes, itâ€™s absolutely wonderful! Their beef cuts are fatty and delicious! Their buffet of raw veges, minced beef with lotus root in a bamboo and sotong balls is substantial enough if too much meat grosses you out. I usually go for their tonkotsu and sukiyaki broths. But their monthly specials are good too!Service is generally efficient and friendly but they can be stretched very thin during peak hours! I usually walk in at 3pm, the crowd is manageable and they are able to attend to you at most times!Highly recommended for a wallet-friendly Shabu experience!

I love the shabu shabu at shabu Sai. I had tried literally all the shabu Sai at all the different locations.It's great value for money during lunch at only $14.99 per pax and add $1.99 for free flow drinks and ice cream. The quality of meats are amazing at this price level!Go with the usual soup base like sukiyaki and yuzu. I had tried the monthly special like laksa and mala but they were below my expectations

Went today for lunch buffet. Lady Staff was kind enough to count my 10 year old kid as Child ( 3-9 years old pau kids price as per restaurant).Free flow of Beef, Port and Chicken trays and choice of 2 sauces. We choose Sukiyaki and Spicy soup base and both were good choice complimenting each other. Buffet choice was reasonable and star was Bamboo Pork but saw people shamelessly filling whole plate the moment it's refilled by staff so we got to taste once only . It was really delicious.There were free flow drinks at some cost and one ice cream which was good enough. The choice of corn flakes as ice cream toppling was surprisingly good. Service was good and staff polite.Overall a good choice at 19.90++ for lunch. Will visit again

Lunch price is normally $12.99++, dinner is double. Yet this is still average price in Singapore cos high class buffet where most Japanese will visit will easily marked as $60++.If you don't wanna pay so high and keen for Japanese style steamboat, this would probably be the best choice.2 choices of soup and great sliced beef but a bit too much fat frankly speaking. As a carnivore, I don't mind the vegi choices are less. As Long as beef is enough and source tastes nice it'll be fine.Sometimes they offer $9++ lunch buffet for vegi only. Feel so sad if a meal doesn't have meat.Overall, this is a great place to hit the spots for carnivores who don't want to spend much yet wanna enjoy Japanese style steamboat

Had my dinner buffet at the Causeway Point Mall, Woodlands with family to usher in the New Year 2016. I proceed to order my beef shabu-shabu with tonkotsu and sukiyaki soup broth or choice.The beef fats is awfully too much. The first 10 sets of beef were thinly sliced, there were hardly any meat, instead they were fats. Unless you want an overnight High-Blood Pressure and arteries getting clogged, these are not beef cuts for shabu-shabu at all! Either the kitchen staff has no idea how to select meat, or the operations manager did not do sufficient QC or the suppliers need more questioning - either way, it is terrible. The soup broth ends up getting too oily and scum-filled all the time, that we spent some time clearing the top layers of oil.So I ordered my next 10 sets and take a peek with other tables -they were all the same awful lot of fatty beef. We wasted no meat, however we found no joy in dining here. I wish they can do improvements. FYI - those beef streaks cut should be meant for slow-braised beef, ideal for "Yoshinoya" style beef, but not shabu-shabu. Please, please improve

I have been here for dinner. The price is higher than lunch (Around 22.99 for buffet not including drinks Plus 2 for drink) (however the lunch time is around 14.99) We could select beef , pork or chicken. For vegetables, we could get it by ourselves. All of food is preprared. The restaruant alowed you to choose 2 kind of soup. I ordered pork bone soup and shabu soup. All of tastes was very nice.

Came here for lunch (to the outlet at Changi City Point) with a colleague. We had a selection of meat and plenty of different vegetables all cooked shabu shabu style and for the remarkably low price of just $20 each (including soft drink, icecream and coffee). The mushrooms were particularly good. It's worth another visit

We were there recently as a group of 5 friends sharing lunch in a fairly new restaurant at a relatively newly-renovated shopping mall. The lunch crowd was in, it was about three-quarters full, so was was happy enough to offer suggestions on the amount of meat to order. After that, it was easy - because we had selected the lunch special, all sides and drinks were free flow. Food was cooked in a pot which allowed two different broths separated by a partition - we chose the pork bones and the spicy broth, both of which weren't bad although the former did generate quite a fair bit of foam which needed to be filtered off at regular intervals. Once the food was cooked, it could be flavoured with sauces of one's own choice and eaten with either soba noodles or rice
