Chef Nobu manages to create different approaches to prepare tender Ozaki beef - Char-Grilled, Sumiyaki, Sashimi, etc. A unique approach to demonstrate how Japanese wagyu can be prepared in many different styles. Bravo!

Wonderful Japanese fine dining experience. If you love beef, this is the place. Go for the 10 course, it’s pricey but worth it! My most perfect meal this lifetime - and I’m not even exaggerating!

This restaurant provides one of the best Japanese Wagyu Beef in Singapore. Ozaki Beef is simply yummy despite the higher price. It's worth to visit this restaurant if you love Japanese beef.

A 100% beef menu may sound off-putting, however Chef manages to bring in lots of variety, not too overfacing. Dessert is ice-cream from the cow...
Expensive, yet worthwhile especially if you enjoy being close up to the food preparation and like chatting to Chef.

Kudos to the chef for devoting an entire menu to wagyu beef. Whilst all dishes feature wagyu, the entire dining experience is indeed unique with each course having a character of its own. Standout was the sukiyaki inspired dish with the beef being swirled in the sukiyaki sauce. Omakase dinner here with a good bottle of red makes for a cracking night out

A small high end restaurant that does justice to the beautiful quality beef served. Conceptually, the menu is designed to serve different parts of a cow from nose to tail. So our meal started with incredibly well prepared tongue and ended with a tail soup. whilst there are tables available, would highly recommend sitting at the counter to watch Chef Nobu weave his magic. Only two options for the dinner menu as it revolves around set meals. The dishes seem incredibly simple to prepare but taste incredibly good. Sitting at the counter also ensures that you get a whiff of the Sukiyaki broth that has been simmering since the restaurant has been opened. Chef Nobu just adds a bit of water daily before he uses the broth to blanch the onions and beef that goes into the Sukiyaki. The restaurant does not come cheap but the ambience and quality of food make a visit here a must when in Singapore

Unassuming, comfortable venue in Tanjong Pagar. Beef used is of very high quality, and they take it about as far as you can probably get with traditional-type dishes like sukiyaki, croquettes and a pair of nicely contrasting soups that bookmark the main set on offer. The grilled cuts are the highlight, with a delicate balance of melted marbling and lean-ness. Definitely go if your wallet can afford a bit of a splurge.

Friendly and polished service from chefs and staff. It was a tongue to tail experience of rare Ozaki beef. We marvelled at the ingenious and delicious ways different cuts of beef was served. Meal is served at the counter so you can watch each dish being delicately prepared. However on a busy nite customers are seated shoulder to shoulder, so its not really suitable for those wishing to have private conversations while they dine.

My partner and I had the Omakase menu for dinner and it was a lovely experience. The beef was perfectly grilled, japanese vegetables was awesome and service was very good. They even had personalised menu for us with our names printed. Its a little pricey but you pay for good quality ingredients and beef so definitely worth every penny spent

We had the 9 course Beef meal and this was absolutely awesome. From the start of soup and starters to the end was fantastic. loved that the beef was cooked in different ways which made the meal fresh and not "gelat" (sick of meat). The chef was cool and fast and it was amazing to watch him at the open top counter
