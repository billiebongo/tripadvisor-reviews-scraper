We had the cereal prawns and good old fashion chilli crab. The seafood is so fresh, and the dishes are reasonably priced.

The biggest letdown of this restaurant was the terrible service. The staff when clearing the table in between dishes just stood there and actually signalled the guests to clear / stack and pass the plates to him. Cutlery / utensils / glasses were stained and mismatched. Food wise, average and could do with a tat less salt but passable. Portions could be a bit bigger too. Sound system here is in need of an upgrade too

The Goldenbeach Seafood Paradise Restaurant, located within the Changi Beach Club is definitely a nice and cozy place to chill out. The food is good and price is reasonable. My family had an enjoyable time over dinner while watching the sun set and large cargo ships passing by. The Peking duck is marvelous while the salted egg and chilli crab are a must to satisfy the taste buds. The service of the staff was excellent and prompt.There is also a pool table outside the restaurant where we had a few games after a heavy meal

Had dinner here after watching the sunset from Changi Boardwalk... reasonably priced food and portions were a good size. Fairly basic interior but nice views over the harbour - ask for a table next to the window. Service not so good - took a while to place my order. Was given some peanuts when I sat down, which I presumed were complimentary - when I went to pay they added $2 to the bill for my peanuts and 50c for a disposal moist wipe... I politely declined to pay for these but was surprised by this

Had a big family lunch here and we all enjoyed the food we ordered. Four small portions of different noodles and rice filled us up very well, and were tasty even with their ordinary presentation. It's by no means a spectacular venue - it's actually very ordinary - however the views make up for the lack of opulence and the staff are very friendly and talkative, which is nice

A recent regular of this restaurant, we first chanced upon this restaurant during our visit to the club. We decided to try it out. We were served by Joseph, the restaurant's manager. His excellent service is highly commendable. His meticulous style of service, coupled with his kitchen's culinary skills, left us greatly impressed.

Used a coupon for Peking duck and took out the chance to try a new restaurant in Singapore. Managed to get a table that looked out over the water.All the food served was nice but it became quickly apparent the Peking Duck was their 'loss-leader' at the expense of having to order more items for the night out. The food was really nice but it does come at a price and by the end of the night the bill for three persons was well into treble figures. Crab being the most expensive at $60/kg. I was a little peeved at being told on the initial table receipt that it was 800g only for them to rack it up to 1kg saying, 'we re-weighed it in the kitchen and it was 1kg.) Bit cheeky. the Peking duck was delicious but they forgot to serve the duck meat/noodles we had ordered. Had to wait...and wait before reminding them. there were apologetic saying they had forgotten.It was a nice evening. Food was nice but for the sort of dishes served I have been to other closer restaurants that serve the same quality. I perhaps would go back but it is quite a distance from anywhere and it certainly isn't the sort of place you drive past
