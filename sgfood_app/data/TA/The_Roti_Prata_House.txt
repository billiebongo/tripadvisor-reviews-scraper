Had veggie curry and prata to eat food was very tasty with mango drink to finish off meal very busy restaurant
2
I have enjoyed the prata here many times, but also have the worst experience with takeaways. You really need a structure to it, and not just get all confused with the orders and serve randomly. Frustrating & Upsetting!
3
Had an egg prata here & the texture was very good; soft & crispy (if that makes sense). What was not good for me was that the egg was not spread throughout the prata & the curry tasted more like sweet sauce than curry.
3
I found the plain roti prata really crispy and its texture was like pastry... not bad at all! The roti prata with egg unfortunately did not have that pastry texture nor taste as good and was also a bit oily.
4
It is so wonderful when i see the menu. Looking for Indian food in Singapore. Having lunch for 4 persons. We spend only $ 28.
Maybe only few Restaurant have so low price.
Great taste too...

Decide to head to this prata place to give it a try. Ordered plain and onion pratas. However, I was quite disappointed with the prata as it was overly crispy and it lost the originality of normal prata. Furthermore, it taste a little bit sweet.
5
Best Prata, fantastic chicken massala and chicken curry! Awsome place. Dont expect fancy service, but friendly, smily and welcoming. The atmosphere of workers, family, simple pleasures of life, around the Best Prata Of the World....
5
Tried Roti Prata in here. Quite delicious. Roti Prata introduced to Singapore by Indian immigrants, roti part literally means flat bread (roti). Making this dish is a theatrical process that involves deftly twirling the stretched dough until it is paper thin. The dough is then cooked on an oiled griddle. Try the plain or egg version with sugar and curry, or explore unorthodox creations ranging from the crepe-like roti tissue to an ice cream parta

I visited one of my Favourite Prata shops in Singapore yesterday.I was so disappointed.I ordered a tissue prata.It was soggy and much too oily.I have always enjoyed the nice crispy pratas with my glass of Teh Halia (ginger tea) "kurang manis" (less sweet).I hope that management will "wake up" and revive their excellent pratas!I'll give it some months before I return and try again
3
Ordered a plain prata, mutton soup and a maggie ikan bilis. Found to be average standard and the maggie ikan bilis was very plain to me. However for the plain roti prata, it was not so bad. The lime juice that I ordered was really straight from a few lime squeezed added to plain water
5
My kids get excited when I say we are going to The Roti Prata house. The Prata is delicious and there are so many varieties to try. Service is fast and the price is very reasonable.
3
the roti prate is over rated at this place. large variety of food but
much better roti prate available in arab street cafes
4
Delicious crispy roti prata, cooked upon order. Eat it when it is hot, to taste the freshness. Parking is very limited, and difficult to find.
5
Best roti prata, super crispy. However service is very lousy and very difficult to find parking space. Price is not cheap also
3
The famous Crispy Prata is actually an unhealthy version made with loads of oil and tastes average, not worth at all.Next day we tried rice with Dal and veggies and it was much better. They had other local favourites also. The chicken biryani is good and comes with huge portion of rice.Not bad to try once in a month
4
This is basic workers food, served fairly quickly and cheaply on plastic plates.At breakfast I saw workmen there, in the evenings, groups of teenagers and young professionals meeting for a chat and PrataJust so you know what you are getting...The menu is Indian, Malay, Indonesian, Chinese and WesternThe delicious Prata they serve are smaller and thicker than a Roti of the Malaysian tradition. Prata dishes come with a small bowl of a curry sauce for you to dip into. The Prata menu is pretty versatile, including a dazzling variety of sweet (Banana, Chocolate, Durian (!), Honey cheese) and savoury (don't want curry? - try cheese & onion - with curry dip on the side)The curries come in 4 different sauces; Red, Massala, Keema, White, and I think these are kept in 4 massive pots in the kitchen, to keep things quick and easyI went in on the mutton soup which came with bread, and prata. the next day I tried a regular cheese & onion (with curry dip). The sweet Teh (Tea Tarik - a black tea served with condensed milk) was delicious. Very cheap to boot, and the chaps were nice to talk to about their business over the years.When you order, the receipt is put on your table, which you take up to the till/cash desk when you are finished
4
Ate here close to midnight and was surprised how lively and crowded it was. Casual and fun if you're looking for a shorts and slippers type of local hang out place. Food tastes better than it looks - we had Maggie goreng and crispy prata. My vote is still for the prata place at Casuarina Curry but it closes at midnight.
3
Delicious prata and curry, but the plain one is pretty tough, try to order other type if possible maybe shudve order the one with egg. cheese bom is delicious way fluffier and soft than the plain one not sure if it is the same base or not. The paper prata is a bit thick to my licking but still okay. Teh tarik not as strong and bitter as expected, more to the sweet and milky type. Service are quick and okay.

Came here for Prata w my fiancÃ©e after our evening run, here's the breakdown:Ambience: 2.5/5Cleanliness: 2/5Customer Service: 3/5Quality of Food: 3/5Value for Money: 3/5Our Orders:Crispy Prata: 0/5Cheese Onion Egg Prata: 4.5/5Chicken Masala: 3/5Nasi Goreng Ikan Bilis: 4/5The Good: Simple, no frills, good for a Budget evening makan.The Bad: The ratings speak for themselves, again Come here if you're looking for Budget Prata and a quick service.Bottom Line: Would come back here again for convenience.
3
The Roti Prata House has been around for decades and I have seen them transform and progress. Needless to say, the reason is because they serve good prata, along with other tasty food.My all time favourite is Nasi Goreng Ikan Billis. Do give it a try!!!
4
Very Tasty pratas, the Curry with it is super good as well, prices are very reasonable. Always a nice meal, and its packed with locals as well :)
4
My family used to came here at least twice a month. And now every time i go to Singapore, I always take time to go to.. The best prata and egg prata ive tried so far
2
Been to a few times and would not declare it the best, given their chicken is overly re-fried and hard to chew and the curry is watery. Good for quick bite but not a go-to place.
4
Went for some Prata goodness with my girlfriend and had some of the freshest prata there. I had the Mutton Murtabak and she had the plain and egg prata. Considering how good it tasted, it wasn't unexpected to pay a little bit more. We ordered a "Mee Hoon Goreng" and it was wetter than the usual fry. Still good nonetheless. Not a bad place to have your late night supper but a little bit on the pricey side.
4
Enjoyed a delicious prata dinner on Sunday evening. The place was busy with full of diners but the service was prompt and good. We ordered plain and egg prata. Plain prata were crispy and possibly the best in town. We also ordered chicken murtabak, which was equally good. I will definitely come back to this plac
3
Been there many times but recognise since it's so popular looks like they are now taking things for granted. Ordered onion prata and got something burnt and with a fee onion sliced thrown in. Asked the first staff if this is how u make one. And he said yes.So ate some but could not stomach it as it was really bad.Then I asked the counter staff and he helped recover service by replacing with one that was cooked well and tasted better .My advise to Prata House please maintain the quality at all times.. Thank you for the service recovery thou..

If one needs to know about a restaurant, one just needs to look at the amount of people eating. This one is just packed with people munching. That is the good one and also the downside. You got to wait for the table to be free and even when you do get a table, you might need to wait for more than 10-15 mins to give out your orders depending on the crowd.But the wait is worth it. We went with my cousin's family and based on his recommendation tried out their Cheese Egg pratas which chicken & Fish curry. Also ordered the paper prata but not a big fan of it. I prefer the traditional ones
3
Lol good for a laugh and cheap bite! This is probably the best value lunch you are going to have on your SG trip.Authentic Malay/Singapore style Prata with curry and Tea Tarek to wash it downHowever please keep in mind that the Murtabak's (stuffed prata's) are actually the star of the show so do not miss them!Packed full of locals for a reason
2
Every single time I went, the food will be great. However, after some time, I'll get a bonus Instant Diahorrea from eating their Prata. Despite knowing the risks, the food is to die for, especially the prata, curry and mutabak. Teh Tarik, isn't the nicest one in town though.
4
Since we are living so near to it, we will always visit them at least once a week for supper. Food has always been great, service has improved tremendously. But something is amiss nowadays. The teh tarik recipe has changed. Diluted nowadays for the hot version. Too sweet for the iced version. Sad to say, we always look forward for their teh tarik. Used to be the best. But now...
1
It one of the most horrendous meal in the last few years . The Prata was oily pre made and lacked the layers or texture . The curry was also Ill-conceived attempt for beautiful dish .
Please please don't go there ever .
4
Absolutely delicious food. Well worth traveling across Singapore City for. Despite the busyness of the place, food was served surprisingly quickly.
5
I luv eating e plain crispy prata and mushroom n chesse prata pairing with teh cino ice or teh tarik after mass every Sat! A great place to chill out w friends over dinner and there is a smoking table too ^^
4
I am a big fan of Roti Prata specially the Roti pisang ( Banana ). Their Prata is great because the extra crispiness. Their chicken boriani is average.
5
Accidentally stumbled upon this gem with a fellow traveler. Their roti prata is famous locally and the clientele was very telling to that end. As we sat and ate our Chicken masala and roti prata, as well as drank our fresh lime juice and milk tea (all of which were awesome), we noticed the array of Singaporean ethnicities present- a group of Indian friends, a Malay woman eating alone, a large table of Chinese high school students who had just come back from a rowing competition, several tourists and more Singaporeans of various ethnicities all apparently on dates. The place was packed. And if Singaporeans from all walks of life enjoyed it, then we knew that was a good sign
5
I am sure you can get good roti prata everywhere in Singapore - but if you are travelling with an 8 & 12 years old - prata house serve bigger variety of prata for kids.Every time we go back to Singapore - it's a must for us to have prata here
4
We heard its one of the best prata place so my husband and I came all the way to try the prata. Both of us had 1 egg and 1 plain (kosong) prata each. The plain one is quite interesting, the texture feels more like curry puff skin (non flaky kind) which wasn't what we expected. But nevertheless, it was good. Just not what we wanted. The egg prata is delicious! Big part of egg in every bite. The curry is also just nice for me, thick and just the right amount of spicy-ness. We had ice teh tarik.. We both couldn't finish as it was too sweet. Would recommend to order something else next time. The ambience is okay, there are lots of choices of food and we would definitely visit again for egg prata and to try other food!About S$9 for the 2 of us.
5
A $9 cab fare from orchard rd (each way) was totally worth it for such awesome roti! The restaurant was completely bustling but we were served immediately and the food was quick and sooooo good. It is completely unpretentious, low prices, laminex tables etc. We were mixed in with people socialising, grabbing food after work, taxi drivers between shifts - made us feel like locals, and that's a great thing when you are travelling
5
Ate here the past few years - its that good. Ordered Cheese egg prata (MY FAVE!!!), it literally melts in your mouth and its a notch pricier than the plain and egg pratas but its really good. P.s, you can always ask for a different curry, i like sour spicy (thai spicy) and i opted for fish curry instead of their usual mutton or chicken curry. Just let them know and they'll bring a small dish of it to you for free
5
Amazing varities of paratas served here are entirely different from the ones we eat in India. I tasted the onion parata which was delicious. Ate well, as we were heading to McRitchie trail. The birayani which we ordered was excellent tooWould love to visit here agai
4
The best crispy prata in town, huge number of options on menu, reasonable price. A great place to go after a walk at Macritchie Reservoir.
1
Need I say more? They do make interesting prata for the sweet toothed though.
But hygiene is an issue here and it's just unacceptable.
5
Food was nice and it was very simple. The roti was different from Malaysia and bit disappointed since I was looking for Malaysian style Roti.
4
Never fail to impressed every visit.
Great service nice and hot with great curry for taste. Try the Ginger Tea to wash it down with and you will be back for more.
4
not a huge fans of indian food but this place keeps calling me everytime i go to singapore (which is often) situated at upper thomson road this place is hard to reach via mrt, i suggest you to go by cab (since its also hard to find a parking space and this place is full all day!)we always order their nasi goreng billis, and roti prata with curry (you can choose chicken, mutton, or veggie) if you're in for dessert you also have many options here!this place never fail to impressed me
4
A good option (other than Little India) to sample some prata, both savory and sweet, as well as local beverages. This is conveniently located within walking distance of a MRT station and is a good option for some late night supper or breakfast, the local way. One can have a morning jog at the nearby MacRitchie reservoir or complete the tree-top walk before indulging in a calories-laden breakfast. There are other neighboring eateries lined up in the area, offering a sample of other local delights

I was looking for a supper place after visiting a friend. Someone suggested this place and we just went along. It was a terrible decision! 1) No parking. We had a hard time looking for a parking. 2) the service crew was not polite. We waited a quite a while before they even bothered to come take our order. And there wasn't many people in the place anyway. When the food arrived, all the different prata were stacked one one plate and the plate was literally thrown onto the table for us to serve ourselves. Only after some prompting did the waiter turn back and tell us which prata was which. 3) the prata was too oily and the 'crispiness' was more like burnt. 4) the curry was 50% oil and 50% curry. 5) when the bill came, it was hand written and in one lump sum. How was I to know what is what? I was not happy at all, but we just paid and left. I think there are plenty of other good prata stalls in Singapore. I will not be returning. If you must take a chance to try, don't say I didn't warn you. Bon appetite
5
Favorite place for breakfast. Serve many variations of prata. The banana and chocolate prata is quite a nice dessert. They serve nice curry gravy for the pratas, definitely one of the best I have tasted so far. I usually have my usual curry chicken and rice to go with my prata. Weekend mornings are to be avoided, it can be quite crowded. They open for supper too..
2
Had supper at the prata house after the sheng siong show. The food is nice. But the staffs is slow in delivering drinks and the curry sauce for the prata. Just now at the restaurant there some of us the drinks are served but some of the drinks are served late.... The bills is like a mess, no detail. The bills is in the state of the who order what n the price of the food is not stated clearly.Please do some review of the bills

Prata is crispy on outside and soft on inside. I love the crispy Kosong prata which is their signature. The hubby and boys enjoyed their cheese / onion pratas. Masala chicken was quite special - has a slightly tangy taste and it's not spicy so even my older boy (12 yrs) enjoyed it and ordered a 2nd helping. Good variety of drinks too - lime, sour plum, milo dinosaur. We'll be back! Just wish they had my fave tissue prata!
4
Their plain prata is fantastic. Crispy and nice.
Try their triangular tissue prata
Their chicken murtabak also nice.
However their mee goreng not that good.
3
We started with a Plain (original) Prata (SGD$0.90) that came with a small plate of curry. Then we also shared a Mushroom Cheese Prata - a thick prata made with slices of button mushroom and plenty of cheese. It was very tasty at first few bites - with and without infusion of curry, but gradually it got colder and the mess of cheese became rather unappetising.We also had a Banana Prata - a sweet, lovely dessert with real banana slices amongst the crepe-like skin of the roti prata. I enjoyed this - would have been perfect with some hot fudge or chocolate sauce!We also had a plate of Maggi Goreng (fried maggi noodle) with some vegetables and eggs. I enjoy maggi goreng usually because the way these Indian restaurants fried it, the texture was springy and flavor was awesome; hence I got hooked. The last time I had this dish here (about 2-3 years back), I had thought it fantastic, as had The Beau and friends with us then.Tonight, however, the noodle was soggy and limp, and the maggi goreng itself was sweet as though it had been fried in tomato sauce only. It was very disappointing.For full review, please visit: http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/11/dinner-at-roti-prata-house-thomson-road.htm

Very good roti with a huge variety of toppings from eggs for breakfast to fruit for dessert. Service consists mostly of grunts and the decor and cleanliness leave something to be desired, but the roti is amazing. The buttery sauce is delicious and the roti sandwich was tangy and delicious.
4
A simple and honest way to experience roti prata in every possible way. Great variety and reasonable prices. Make sure you get what you order. Some of the staff simply forgets what you have ordered. The final check is always a secret to me. Since it's not a lot I don't even want to understand the invoice. The tire shop next door is sometimes a bit noisy.
4
Came here to have my meal during lunch time. The roti prata is very crispy and the drinks such as the tea Tarik is a must to drink. Service is quite fast as they are using ipad to take orders. It is nearby to upper pierce reservoir and nice scenery if you are seating outdoor
4
Came here with a my friend and his family one evening recently. We order a lot of stuff and one by one they came. Overall I have to say that I enjoyed the food here. You have to expect that its not the Ritz and most of the curries are pre prepared and then microwaved. The paratha are freshly made and certainly live upto expectations. Service can be slow when busy but I would certainly come here again. It's open 24/7
4
Read a few of negative comments about this restaurant but when we got here, it's still in the morning and it wasn't crowded yet. The staff was quick with our order. We tried the plain roti prata which tastes soo good and also Nasi Goreng Merah. We'll be back again if we visit Singapore
4
We visited The Roti Prata House in Singapore after a lovely walk in MacRichie Reservoir. THe Pratas were so good that we had two additional servings. If one enjoys Crispy Pratas this is the place. Service is a little slow but it is a busy place and all pratas are freshly prepared when ordered and the prices are as cheap as chips. Wonderful breakfast!!!A visit to a "no frills" local restaurant is a must for all travellers and i am looking forward to my next trip to Singapore next year to revisit this plac
5
Locals brought me here and told me it is the typical supper to get in Singapore after a night out. They are open 24/7 though options are less at late night/early morning. The prata is very tasty and freshly made, to be eaten with curry or sugar. Also liked the milk tea drink very much
4
This place is hailed for the best prata in town- and I must say the choices are aplenty! From savoury to sweet, anything you can imagine, they have! I also had the maggi goreng which was just average but the fried chicken was superb! This place is quite far away from central Singapore but if you drive, by all means make a stop
