Walked in to try a new cafe. Upmarket prices for low quality taste and food. Quite sad as place looked promising.
5
Went to this cafe the 2nd times. It is still one of the cosy place to chill. Nice cafe latte and nice cakes! But cakes too pricy i think. In general, a great place for family. There are lots of reading provided.

I tried recently again . Its Good . Flock Cafe Quality is consistent over years . I felt the same as first time , the service is better . Its nice place to visit next year too.. :)

Have been a regular here for 3 years now and still the place maintains its standard of good food and service. Such a relief. Must visit for breakfast.

I had an office lunch here yesterday with 8 of my colleagues. Most of us ordered the lunch sets which tasted good and are value for !The beef patty rice set I ate came with a tasty beef patty, butter rice, side salad, slaw and a drink. It was nice and I enjoyed it!My colleagues had the fish sets or roasted chicken sets which they said were good too

I and my wife actually bumped into this cafe by accident.We were actually going to that area to find a bookshop (on the recommendation of a friend ). And we were lost.Then we came to this little cafe. The staff was very helpful and point us the right direction. After the bookshop visit, we went to the cafe for a rest.Immediately, we realise that this is a very local cafe.The neighbours came in here to read, to do works (on the computer, free wifi provided ) and to relax.The atmosphere is welcoming . The cafe owner is a fourth generation South Indian. He ans his wife are very friendly, They were doing the X'mas decoration and we chat a bit when they are doing their work.They told me the shop has been there for 5 years but little people outside the neighourhood know about the cafe.It is a shame.The Coffee and the Earl Grey Tea they make are good. So are their cakes.If you are in that neighourhood and want a nice welcoming cafe, then this is the one

Our recent 2 day stop over in Singapore was made all the more enjoyable with discovering this gem of a cafe just minutes from our AirBnB apartment. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast 2 mornings in a row and great coffee - second cup was complimentary! Service was exemplary, friendly and attentive, would recommend to anyone visiting SG
4
Came here for a coffee after lunch nearby. Surprisingly busy for a Wednesday lunchtime given its location away from the city. I ordered a cappuccino and it came out at the right temperature with the froth in the right proportions and a little design in it
5
We confirm french toast with banana is delicious. You can also trust the home burger! The crispy bacon is worth the trip. On the top of it, server and owner are very nice. We highly recommend for a little chance from Asian food.
5
Food is delicious and way of serving is good.Best ambience and comfortable place to have a delicious food.The cafe has a nice interior and chill ambience is surrounding the cafe,feeling good.Overall best cafe in singapore.Will visit again.

Good place for brunch. I tried the croissant with salmon. It was good. However my friends think it could be bigger portions.
5
Friendly staff, cool but cozy atmosphere - interesting menu (pancakes and fish). Outside terrace shaded , inside not to cold - conditioned...

A family-run cafe, Flock's atmosphere is deliberately relaxed. Started from our love of cafes, good company, we seek to let our customers feel what we love so much about relationships.Coupled with our selection of music and modern industrial decor, we are sure you will definitely feel at home.Nestled in a quiet enclave in Cafe in Tiong Bahru, Flock Cafe provides the backdrop for that business meeting or the perfect spot to while the day away. We know you cherish your personal space, that's why we have deliberately kept seating comfortable.Our coffees are made with only the best beans, which means the Speakeasy Blend. It has a medium body with hints of chocolate and nutty overtones. All lovingly roasted by our friends over at Liberty Coffee

Had the smoked salmon with poached egg and brioche dish for lunch. Very slow service for 7 people - wanted 25 minutes for my dish. Not sure why it took so long since poaching an egg only takes around 7 minutes, toasting the brioche bread 3 minutes tops, and the smoked salmon just remove it from the packaging?Despite that, my poached egg was still raw - with the whites still transparent. Hollandaise sauce too runny and didn't have the buttery eggy taste that makes a Hollandaise sauce. The dish overall was too salty as well with the use of smoked salmon. Poached salmon might work better.I wouldn't go there again - disappointing attempt with the poached egg and Hollandaise sauce. Better off making them myself honestly

My wife and I were spending a week in Singapore, in the Tiong Bahru area, when we realized we had a cafe right outside the building we were staying at . We gave it a try and we were impressed. I know Singapore has great eats and I truly enjoy all the foods that Singapore has to offer. Having said that, it's nice to take a break from it all, and enjoy the nice western/fusion dishes this place has to offer. They have awesome, made from scratch juices, teas and other drinks on their menu. The staff is awesome and very friendly. It's a very relaxed atmosphere and a nice place to hang out and "cool down" . I also don't want to forget the awesome pastries available to enjoy with your beverage of choice. So whenever you're in Singapore and in this area (or not)please drop by and enjoy a fresh drink and awesome meal. Also forgot to mention that, they have breakfast and lunch specials during the week, at a very reasonable price. Again drop by and enjoy

Location - heart of Tiong Bahru, near the MRT & buses. Decor - inviting Service - surly. They couldn't afford a smile when greeted. Runner couldn't figure out where I was (and the place isn't big) Had carrot cake & espresso (photo below)- cake was frozen, the cream in between the layers was iced & so was the cake. It as cold. Espresso - burnt and flat. No better than the chains. Don't come. Won't come again.
4
The staff were mostly really friendly and accommodating though something must have gone wrong with their system as we had to convince them that the burger that we had ordered and paid for was ours! The ambience is nice though a little austere. The food was mostly good (the burger and chips especially!) though my poached eggs weren't very runny and my smoked salmon was over cooked. However, the coffee was good and I loved my frappe as it wasn't too sweet. They let us stay for a long while though so we were very happy
3
Usually on Saturdays, we would usually do a brunch or late lunch. At times we would explore the vicinity of the places around us.Flock cafe is around the Tiong Bahru neighbourhood. The cafe has a nice interior however the quality of food is just average and the price is a little steep for the portions served
5
FlockCafe food taste was awsome - my family wants to visit singapore to have lunch in Flockcafe . It was really worth going there having food , We really enjoyed in Singapore.Keep it up.
5
Awesome Cheeky Eggs and Orange Cinnamon Mocha !! Great songs and fantastic service. Free Parking ( for now ) at the back of the cafe....
5
little difficult to find out but coffee was great mostly i like the wall quotes.staff are very friendly.nothing to complain.
2
I do love the week day specials of eggs and coffee for $10, but sadly one thing that really annoys me is when a cafe advertises that they have wifi (and the staff will happily direct you to it) only to find out that it's a network that doesn't work and never did. With so many options around this area I would have thought the competitive edge would be required. Not to mention the coffee was burnt... not a great start to my morning sadly
3
We visited Flock cafe on a Saturday morning and I would have expected the cakes to be fresh for such a busy day of the week. Unfortunately the cheesecake I ordered was definitely from earlier in the week. As the cake slice had been pre-cut, the sides and top of the cheesecake had formed a rubber like layer that tasted horrid. If you slice the top and sides off, the middle of the cheesecake was nice, but not worth $8. Perhaps the cafe should put protective baking parchment or cellophane between slices in future to keep them fresh.Aside from that, staff were very friendly, the coffee was really good and the atmosphere inside the cafe was pleasant. Plenty of seating
4
We went there for a Sunday brunch and tried different options such as big breakfast, poached Bénédicte egg and salmon which were pretty satisfying. Service was nice despite having to order and pay at the account. I just regret that tables are a bit small if you are tall and there were not sweet only pancakes or waffles
1
My daughter and I went over to Flock to have breakfast and do some work. The coffee and eggs were delicious but the avocado was inedible as was the over ripe pineapple in the granola and fruit. When we paid over $30 for breakfast we expected more but this breakfast was sub par. Sadly the bathroom wasn't clean and this added to my irritation. I'd go back for coffee and cake but never for another meal.
1
We went there on Saturday for lunch. We waited 35 minutes for a tasteless burger and 45 minutes for another tasteless scrambled eggs. Hardly any excuse for the wait . I don't mind waiting when the food is good but for the kind of food we had was way below average. Please skip this place. We should have gone to PS cafe

I came on a Saturday, and have been walking for a while. I wanted a cold drink and a sit down. The cafe was full of people, but not exactly crowded. I sat down for a Ice lemon tea. The seats were sofas, but not exactly comfortable. The lemon tea...was lemon tea. I wouldn't say is good though. I didn't eat anything or tried their coffee, so it's hard for me to review on those. I finished quick, because the noise gave me a feeling of being clustered. When I walked outside, it felt quiet and nice to have the sun shining. A girl was sitting down with her coffee and labtop, concentrating. If I wasn't feeling to heated up by the sun, I would have chosen to sit outside as well
3
Had a burger in here one day and my companion had the fish and chips. The burger was ok, had much better in other places. The fish and chips were a good portion size, but the fish soon became very sickly. Everything was alright overall, but I probably won't return.
5
So glad I stopped by here! Loved the coffee, loved the food, loved it all. I'd go back and try more.
4
Wanted a good coffee near Tiong Bahru. Come across this cafe, the coffee is good. Will come back to try their brunch next time.
4
The firat cafe I've dined at. On the whole, a convivial atmosphere, decent food, warm and helpful staff. Limited seating, can get a little too close for comfort on weekends. Good enough to warrant return visits, though.
4
Ordered croissant with scrambled eggs and hot chocolate. it was perfect, just what I needed for energy to go pottering about all day.
The staff were very friendly too.
3
It was ok, but nothing more. We went there for breakfast, I had croissant with scrambled eggs and salmon and my boyfriend has pancakes. All was fine, but nothing special, we were just hungry but were not stunned by the dish. Two breakfasts and two juices and the bill was 50 SGD - quite pricey. The service didn;t approach us when we sat down, so we went to order and pay at the counter but then we saw that they were actually approaching the clients and taking the orders - I guess it's because we were the only couple outside so nobody came to take the order
1
This place looks very hip and happening, but boy was I disappointed by the food! We ordered 3 different mains and nothing was even close to OK. My chicken burger was the grossest lunch item I have ever ordered in my 12 months in Singapore. Undercooked chicken, old and dry bun covered in a gross layer of green butter, old lettuce. Horrible, I get the shivers when I think back to it. Maybe check it out for a cup of coffee but DO NOT eat here
4
Can here with my daughter for a flat white and a babycino. We stumbled on the cafe quite by accident, but as it was busy, we thought we'd give it a go.The decor was what I would describe as urban-chic, with the natural features of the premises exposed (eg, bare concrete floors).Service was friendly and they even three in the babycino for free.I can't comment on the food, but the coffee was really nice. We will definitely return
3
Second time coming here, served us the wrong coffees when we ordered a iced cappuccino and latte, but was served with two iced lattes, they were good though. Drinks were faster than the cake that was already sliced and sitting next to the counter - all they had to do was put it on the plate and serve us. Staff knew the food well, knew the ingredients for the food, which was great when I asked about the Hummingbird Cake - it was banana cake covered with cream cheese - would recommend if you like banana cake. It wasn't heavy but light!Good to come here on non-peak hours, to chat with friends etc as it is a good environment to relax i

Came here for a morning catch up with a friend. Coffee was good, we both had a slice of cake, both slices were huge and served with 2 forks each, so we had 4 forks between 2 of us. I would prefer a smaller slice of cake at a lower price, we couldn't finish our cake so it was a bit of a waste. It also cost more to have a coffee and cake than to have coffee and breakfast!!Service was slow and inefficient. My friend asked to pay with a visa card. She wasn't told that the cafe didn't accept visa and the cashier put her card in the NETS machine. As a result her card was locked and she was unable to pay. Staff offered no apology or explanation. Pretty poor experience

Dropped in to the Flock cafe at Ghim Moh on New Year's day. It was packed, with many tucking into hearty breakfasts/brunches after the festivities of the previous night. The lady behind the counter politely asked us to wait and indeed we were seated within 5 minutes. We just had butter croissants and tea/coffee, it was delicious (croissants toasted very nicely). Order at the counter, dishes served at your table with a smile. Staff very affable and professional. Will definitely be back

Overall very good and service efficient. Meals are tasty and nice variety, liked the small touches with the herbs. Burgers look huge.

This was our regular breakfast stop in tiong bahru. Food,service,price and coffee all good. Friendly staff.

We usually go to Flock for coffee or brunch. They serve good coffee comparable to the other cafes within the area. We've trued their brunch selection but the price is pretty on the high side. Usually alot of people during weekends so if you wanna try this cafe, I suggest you visit during weekdays

Came here for gals hangout, 1 breakfast, 1 burger and 2 coffee costs $46 i thought it was a bit steep. Naturally i would have some expectation that the food should be good. My flatwhite was good, cant fault the coffee and the milk with just the right amount of milk that distinguishes the flatwhite from other coffee. My scrambled eggs with croissant and smoked salmon was the problem. Crossiant was actually crispy and well prepared so no issue. Scrambled eggs was ok on its own but but it could use with extra seasoning as it was a bit blend. It was somewhat soggy too that it made my crossiant soggy as well. The smoked salmon was kind of fishy. It would have been better if it has some cream cheese or capers or lemon on the side to complement it. The salad was just a few lettuce and slices of tomatoes. It would have been better with some balsamic vineger or at least some dressing. I had to eat the lettuce wrapped with the somewhat fishy smoked salmon like korean bbq since it was so dry. For close to $20, the dish should have more things going on to stimulate our palete. My friend's pork cheek burger looked promising and i tried the pork and it was well cooked and seasoned. Dont know about the rest but the fries seemed ok too. It would also have been better if there was tartar sauce or mustard or some other sauces for dipping fries other than chilli sauce and ketchup like mcdonalds, since they were positioning themselves as somewat 'atas' cafe.We also ordered the lemon curd tart which was very delicious. The custard was very smooth although the tart crust was quite hard and difficult to slice with a dessert fork. Overall, hope they would improve with the food to make the overall experience better

Unfortunately didn't have scones or cupcakes or muffins - also no WiFi (but that seems to be the case with most Tiong Bahru cafes; don't want diners loitering I guess). So, plan to go there for lunches or pitstops, not somewhere u can hang out reading a book or surfing. Cakes looked amazing though, I forgot to take pictures but the selection include banoffee pies, dark chocolate, carrot, and peanut butter and jelly (amazing!!!!). the other ones looked fabulous.

Been going to Flocks in Tiong Bahru but found their latest open-kitchen outlet at Ghim Moh as good.Tried their highly recommended favs: the Cheeky Eggs and Scrambled Eggs Butter CroissantBoth simple yet perfectly done and dished up prettily. Would keep returning to the Ghim Moh place.Overall, friendly service, nice food, great hole-in-the-wall find in a place lacking in little eateries like this

We wanted to like Flock, we really did. We were looking forward to coming here, especially after reading the reviews.I ordered poached eggs, braised pork cheek on an english muffin.The pork was delicious; shredded, well-cooked and tasty. The rest of the meal, however was not good.The muffin was warm, not toasted. The eggs tasted like they had been cooked in a vinegar solution. They were so vinegary that the yolks had been bleached to a pale yellow.If the people at Flock read this, please add only one or two drops of vinegar to the water in which you're poaching eggs, not half a bottle! You're not supposed to be able to taste the vinegar.I walked away feeling quite unwell after trying to eat one of the vinegary eggs. I think the coffee was fine, but I can't just remember
3
To answer my own question, I think I only return because it's close to where I live and has a rather nice ambience. Food here is expensive (breakfast for 2, including tea and coffee, set me back over S$30). The cakes here, like many cafes in Singapore, are decent but over-priced. A slice of bundt costs more than S$5. For breakfast, my scrambled eggs arrived runny (accompanied by 2 very, very thinly sliced pieces of toast). I don't know why I'm such a sucker to keep coming back. Will try other new cafes in the area (which are probably just as pedestrian) before deciding if I should return

I'm sitting here macchiato in-hand. The temperature is good, the coffee taste is definitely there, but... Not my ideal macchiato, but a solid 7/10.Great vibe. Love the solid wooden block chairs & tables. Its nice & cool inside, an industrial feel & the simple menu & uncluttered space is comfortable. Not too hectic. Looks like a great place for breakfast, but have your coffee at Forty H4nds first

Had lunch here with my wife. Came before the lunch crowd. There were quite a few empty tables. I had already made a reservation anyway. Soon after the place quickly filled up. Ordered Cheeky Eggs, Mushroom sandwich and coffee at the counter. Not long after the coffee and food were served. The braised pork cheek in Cheeky Eggs was flavourful and well cooked. The poached eggs were also well prepared. Salad was fresh. Only slight problem was that the eggs were probably served with too much fluid onto the bread, resulting in the bread being soggy. I enjoyed the herbed baked portobello, mozzarella and rocket sandwich very much. The ciabatta was nicely toasted and the portobello was really juicy and well seasoned. Really a pleasure when eaten hot. What impressed me most was the coffee. The flat white was presented with only a very thin layer of foam on the surface. I thought this was exactly what it should be. They also had cappuccino and latte on the menu. These varied in the amount of foam on the surface. More importantly the coffee was good. Smooth, not overly acidic. Finished the meal with chocolate cake. It was stated that the cakes were supplied by a third party. But it was still good. Service was quite fast and food was served hot. Portions were adequate for the average appetite. There was self served chilled water favoured with lemon. The atmosphere was not bad. Table was a bit small. Depending on where you are seated, it might or might not be the best place to sit and chat. The pricing is on the high side. But I think it is still worth a visit if you appreciate good food and enjoy a good cup of coffee
