A.k.a. The Gallery food court at Marina Square. The food is decent, prices are very reasonable, and the options are wide-ranging. Plus, it offers a good view of Marina Bay Sands and the Esplanade. The stall with roastings is good for cheap yummy eats.

Roast duck stall is pretty good.
Can comment about the rest but should be average. .
Sit by the windows for a great view!

We have long wanted to try dining in this resto due to its unique concept of multiple cuisines under one venue. You can cross order. My previous try of take out of ramen was a letdown but this dine in was the complete opposite. We had the dumplings (3-in-1 basket Xiao long bao), salmon teriyaki, chicken teriyaki. You may want to complement your mains with veggies like moyashi itame and doumiao garlic plus a chaser of hot ocha. These make up a light meal but good enough to taste a variety of meals. Good service. Prompt and warm. Even cashiering was efficient. Will go back to try the other menus.

Best place to have lunch with colleagues and everybody can eat what they want. You can spend 10 dollars and feel you had a twenty dollar experience. It does get busy over Lunch so come early or late. Seating in the back is more calming. Definitely a regular place to go t

After some heavy duty shopping at the Marina mall we stayed for dinner because this is the best value for money if you want to not spend too much in Singapore and food outside in restaurants can be very expensive. We opted for oyster omelette and a typical Singaporean dish Hokkien Prawn Mee (shrimp noodle) ,and minced meat+seafood wanton noodle soup. Delicious meal.Visited during our honeymoon in Jan 2015 but cannot change the year

This is a 'local' food court, where local office workers and shoppers come for lunch. But the view is clearly above average!There has not been any other place I have visited in Singapore that can boast lunch in an air-conditioned venue for <$20 with a view to match

Frequented the food hall several times on a recent visit to Singapore.Easy access from the Esplanade MRT station.As usual with most food courts in Singapore, quality isn't an issue and you are spoilt for choice.The facilities are modern and clean (as would be expected) and the food was great !Also this is a fantastic place to watch the F1 Grand Prix if you haven't purchased a ticket.Watch the cars travel down Raffles Blvd before turning right into the Marina Bay grandstand section..Many locals get in early to "reserve" a spot, but if space is an issue, just head to the outside level on either the 2nd or 4th levels

I loved the variety of Asian cuisines in one place. Reasonably priced and in great ambiance. If you are alone, table by the ice skating rink-- the activity will entertain you.Another important thing is that locals eat here, so, if they do, the food must be good, right? It is very good.I wish there was more than ONE place to buy drinks.

We had lunch at this place and it was a nice experience, considering that some food crews working are also Filipinos. The place is clean, organized, except those crews who clean the tables that don't even bother to say "excuse me." But anyway, the place is good and I love it. The foods also are varied and had many choices

There are quite a number of morden styled Japanese restaurant. The quality of food is average. on the menu, they do have quite a large variety of Japanese food and deserts. prices are not too expensive but average pricing

Clean, very wide variety of food, cheap! It was near my hotel in Marina Bay Sands. So it was just a 15 minutes stroll from the hotel.

These are a bit watered down from the original stallls Singapore is famous for but you get a comfortable seat, airconditioning and a great choice of foods. I would guess there are 10-15 different choices from fish to vegetarian to Korean, Thai and specialty drinks. It is full of people so come early or late it gets crowded but good food
