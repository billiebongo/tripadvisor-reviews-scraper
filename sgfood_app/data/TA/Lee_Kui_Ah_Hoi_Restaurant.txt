Certainly a place for the Teochews in Singapore and for those who like Teochew food. Sad to say, the restaurant is gone and for most, it was a good memory of good food and gathering with families and friends.

Very difficult to review this fairly, it was very late at night and they looked as though they wished to close. Food was fair.

One of the better places serving Teochew food in Singapore. Always come here to eat my favourite Chinese cabbage with dried scallop dish.
5
The restaurant gives a nostalgic feel and the cuisine is authentic. Give the cold crab and oyster omelette a try.

We had went there a few time before, unfortunately, on this trip that we wanted to taste its Teochew delicacies, we found the shop had changed hands and none of the neighbours were able to say if they will ever operate again, as they had no one to take over the business.Sad..

This Teochew F&B serves authentic Teochew food since 47 years ago and at its current location in Mosque Street for more than 20 years. Typically a Chinese restaurant devoid of elaborate decor but only good food, it will soon be a memory to many patrons as it closes its door on 20 December 2015! Reason given was the expiry of lease for the restaurant in the 2 units of conserved shophouses in Chinatown! Very very sad that such genuine food is quickly disappearing due to high rental in the area

Very good. Great service from the aged Ah Hia who came by to clarify if our order was for Orh Neng or Orh Luak. Aunties changed plates often. Crayfish and prawns were very fresh and sweet. Jellied trotter authentic and water chestnut dessert is freshly made ( we tried to change the dessert order but were told sorry your water chestnuts have just been chopped). Veg fried with tee poh and garlic had just the right crunchiness. Spent $40/pax party of 4 for lunch, 6 dishes.

A die-hard fan of teochew cuisine, this is my long-time favourite. Glad they didn't expand and manage big monster they couldn't cope. If you were nice, the head waiter / old uncle gave good suggestions including dishes of the day (seasonal items, not in menu). Eat your heart out. BYO possible

The place itself gives you a very 70's feeling. There are a few restaurants left with these type of 70's 80's ambience. The service was really good - sincere and prompt. The owner himself tended to us and was very charming. Food is hard-core Teochew cuisine with Cold Crab as the speciality. The Crabs were full of roe and very tasty as an appetizer. There is a whole list of traditional Teochew cuisine. I tried only the Cold Crab, fried intestines, the seafood noodles, the siew mai. 3 of us for lunch set us back about $100

Located in the busy Chinatown area, this traditional restaurant that has been popular for the past decades still serves porridge with authentic Teochew dishes. It is a good place for their signature cold crabs which are reasonably priced as compared to the few upmarket restaurants that still offer these. Though recently refurbished, it has retained its simplicity and their freindly staff will always make you feel welcomed

I really enjoyed the flavours, the range of dishes, and the willingness of the staff to explain the cuisine and history. While locals and experts may well have a different perspective, as a tourist I loved the food and experience. It felt authentic.
3
With 30 years of rich history, I expected quite abit from this restaurant, food quality was moderate, typical teochew taste, but could be better. Service was okay, and in my opinion, too expensive for the entire experience.

Prawn rolls here are the best we've tasted so far. The other dish is their oyster porridge without minced meat. Good stuff!

Despite working so nearby, I never got a chance to try the food at Lee Kui. By chance, we finally found ourselves at the doors of Lee Kui and seeing that there were quite a few of us, we got ourselves a table. The menu is a simple laminated A3 sized paper but the interesting thing is, the menu only shows the items available but not the price! We ordered the braised duck, oyster omelette, stir fried greens, deep fried pig intestines, prawn balls and the Chye Poh Kway Teow. The bill came up to $150 for six of us. Simply excellent. Will return!

A restaurant which is friendly and efficient with truly authentic and very tasty Teochew style cuisine. It's getting harder to find as the generation ages so maybe it's worth experiencing before something happens to this gem of a place. Simple in decor and reasonable in price with quality that is uncompromised. That's no longer so common here these days.Braised duck and steamed pomfret are standards which go well with rice or the salted vegetable Rice noodles

Located along Mosque Street in Chinatown, customers come to Lee Kui Restaurant more for the Teochew cuisine than the ambience. Large round banquet tables and smaller 4-pax ones pack the restaurant. It gets noisy as customers fill the restaurant and enjoy the food.We pre-ordered their specialty steamed cold crabs (hard shell) along with other favorites. The steamed crabs were large, meaty and tasty. The braised duck with tofu were nicely sliced and presented on a plate. They went well with porridge. Fish maw soup was generous with fish maw portions. The steamed pomfret was large and we were surprised at its size. It was steamed to perfection and we enjoyed the sweetness of its chunky meat. We also ordered omelette with oysters, and steamed cabbage with dried scallops. Dinner ended with dessert of yam paste with pumpkin and gingko nuts.We had a hearty dinner and food portions were large for our table of 10s. Good food

Forget what is says about $13-$20 - that is hugely inaccurate and misleading unless you eat the cheapest of dishes at which point they become generic so still over priced. 5 of us went there tonight, had a very good diner, had 3 beers between us, and I was shocked that the bill came to $52 each. The cheapest dish was fried spinach with garlic - a generous portion, all the dishes were, but this was the cheapest dish at $18. Other dishes included cold pork, braised slices of duck with hard dougan, chicken in spicy sauce (excellent) and squid balls / spring rolls set. Each dish was $25 before tax and service. Ordered 1 fish which was nice but nothing to write home to tell the great grand parents about , and that was a whopping Â£43 before tax and service. Every dish was well cooked and large portions, the boss very friendly, the waitresses ugly and universally uninterested (just an opinion - please don't take offence if you red this - it may have been a different waitress served us), and lastly, the kitchen closes at 9:30 and closing time is about 10, so you can't stay there after dinner to enjoy good chat and more beer. Would I go back? only if someone else were paying or if I were a lot richer. Is the food good? definitely, very good indeed. Are the portions big? Yes, they are. Is the management friendly and helpful? Yes. All told, a goood but costly night out

Every time we visited Singapore, we will drop by Lee Kui for the cold crabs, oyster egg, fried pork intestine, fish maw soup & the yam dessert. There are 4 generations in our family who have tasted Lee Kui. Now my kids looked forward to the cold crabs and their favorite fried pork intestine. Every family meet up will be done in Lee Kui for the chinese dining atmosphere ie round tables. So far, the food has been wonderful and remember, ask for recommendations. There is an old man there (I just can't remember his name) but he remembers us even if seeing us only once a year, he knows what we like most. And we always take his recommendations because they have never failed us before. Parking will be a bit of a problem as it is located in Chinatown but the trip to this restaurant would be worth the trip to Singapore. However, since the demand for cold crabs is high, best to call in advance to book. Kiasu-ism must be practiced here so that one won't missed out on the signature dish that this restaurant is famous for

I'm certainly no expert in regional Chinese cuisine, but we had an excellent meal here. The maitre d' (well ok, old geezer who seemed to be in charge) put us onto a nice table, surrounded by chinese families out for a meal, advised us against the stewed duck 'legs' (probably feet), and ensured we had fun. The food was very good indeed. We'll definitely be back
4
In summary: located in bustling Chinatown this friendly local restaurant has great food and service, we'll definitely be back and will take our friends for this great authentic Chinese food. We visited for Sunday lunch. The restaurant was busy with family's around large round tables. The atmosphere very welcoming and friendly. We were seated straight away and given both the tourist menu and local menu. The owner came to talk to us and when he realised we lived in Singapore he took the tourist menu away and recommended some Chinese dishes, cooked in the Chinese style. He recommended appetisers: prawn balls and spring rolls. Mains: special fried rice with prawns and pork along with sweet and sour pork - all were delicious and just the right amount of food. The staff were very attentive, although not all spoke English they still managed to make us feel welcomed and valued as customers.

Nice food, good services and great food. Found long lost taste had 20 year ago. Great Teacheow style. Definitely a must try.

I enjoyed the pomfret, goose, omelette and hay cho

Came here with a friend who highly recommended the plain fried char kway teow. Ordered the prawn rolls and a soup with the famous char kway teow.Food was average. Price was high for what you get. The plain fried kway teow for eg cost $12 for a plain plate of fried char kway teow with nothing in it! It had a nice wok flavour but fur $12?!?!? The cost for that dish would have only been $0.50!!! Would not go back again!Plus, the staff seemed to be pushing you to order more stuff and their expensive fish...sigh...

By the delta of the Han river in the hilly region of Swa Tow (mountain head), lived the Teochew people. In the 19th - early 20th century, many of these people left their homeland to find jobs and start new lives in foreign lands. One of these lands was Singapore. These Teochew people started families and put down roots in their new home. They adapted to new foods and grew to love foods from their neighbours who were often immigrants from other countries themselves. However, deep in the heart of every Teochew person is an insatiable appetite for the food of their ancestral homeland. Teochew food is about fresh ingredients and light flavours. It shuns the zingy spices of sichuan dishes and the greasy aromas of cantonese foods. Fresh and salt water seafood other star in teochew dishes supported by humble but delicious herbs and vegetables like coriander, ginger, yams, cabbages and turnips.This style of cooking has unfortunately fallen out of fashion in fast-paced trend conscious Singapore. Stressed out urbanites seem to prefer spicier, more aromatic, and greasier foods, perhaps in an attempt to compensate for unfulfilled aspirations and unhappy lives.Luckily, the Teochew flag still flies at this restaurant. The food here is proper Teochew. The seafood is fresh and prepared with a delicate touch. I visited this restaurant for dinner with my Teochew grandparents who had just declared themselves "small eaters" that very afternoon. However, they didn't not stop eating at Ah Hoi from the first dish to the last. The amount that the small framed elderly couple ate here was truly amazing.How amazing was it?The cold crab as so sweet and tasty that it had to be completely dissect to extract every last morsel of delicious flesh.The steamed pomfret vanished from the plate within 5 minutes. Vanished is definitely the right word as any self-respecting Teochew native eats the head too.The oyster omelette had a generous number of fresh oysters on a cushion of beautiful "crispy on the outside, tender on the inside" omelette.The cabbage wrapped meat was tender and bursting with sweet cabbage and savoury meat flavours. The yam paste dessert was of a perfect creamy consistency and made of 100% real yams unlike some cheap versions which are bulked up with sugar and thickening agents. YAMmy!The service was commendable as well. Our servers were knowledgeable about the dishes and able to advice on quantity and what dishes to try. They also brought the food out in a particular order in to maximise enjoyment. Delicate dishes were alternated with heavier dishes so you could fully appreciate the different flavours without becoming fatigued.We went home with very happy tummies that evening

The other reviews are very much on the money. This modest restaurant carries on the tradition of Teochew cuisine, which lost a flag-bearer when Mong Hing closed for good just over a year ago.We haven't tried a wide range of food here yet -- just the fried mullet in leek gravy (the best in town, IMO), braised goose meat, stir fried veggies and prawn balls. What's impressive is that these fairly modest dishes were all of a high standard, and prices and service quite good

This restaurant has been around for very very long, even my grandfather used to dine here when he was younger. The service is excellent, the waiting staff are actually older aunties, and they are very prompt in their service, fast in refilling the empty tea cups and changing the dirty plates. Based on their experience, they will advice you not to OVER-order, unlike some restaurants, whom do not really care. Try their cold crab, "hey-zhor" (prawn-ball) and "orh-nee" (yam paste), Definitely will not regret

We visited this restaurant based on its location and write up here. We were greeted in a very friendly and happy manner. Food and service was excellent, our party of five opted for the set menu but asked for some alterations which were gladly accommodated. Service was very attentive and some of our party even got travel advice for Malaysia, where they are heading in a few days. Reasonably priced, the proprietor even rounded the amount down a little to get to an easy round number. Recommended

Every dish we ordered was delicious! We had 7 dishes in all, including the "or nee" yam paste with pumpkin dessert, which was divine! We also ordered gluttonous rice stuffed in duck, which had to be pre-order, but it was absolutely wonderful. Mind you, this is not the same kind of food you eat at hawker centres. This restaurant is family-run and from all the food that comes out, they poured their hearts and love into every dish they cooked for us. Highly recommended to everyone who loves Teo Chew dishes, or just a good hearty meal to share with friends

This Teochew (Chaozhou) restaurant has been running since the sixties and is by reputation very popular. The evening we were there half of the tables were reserved, but empty, so the atmosphere was pleasant. It's almost a no-frills restaurant, where the quality of the food is all that matters.And the food is certainly delicious. We ordered the famous cold crabs and they came almost immediately, with roe. They were quite small, but easy to eat. The flesh was compressed and firm, much better than the fiddly nature of just cooked crabs. We ordered a fish maw soup, which came in small bowls for everyone rather than a large communal bowl - this meant, no seconds. I don't usually like pork intestines, because of the smell, but the ones we were served were cleaned very well, and were delicious and succulent. We also had oysters with egg, chicken and chestnuts, and garlic kailan. The owner advised us against eating more than we could eat, which was a nice gesture. He picked me as a foreigner rather than a naturalized expat, and wondered aloud if I could finish a bottle of Tiger on my own. It made me laugh.Teochew food is very popular in Singapore, but I've never eaten it better than here. The service is prompt and polite. I found nothing to complain about

My family went there for dinner on a weekday and the restaurant was full!We had steamed promphret, hei cho, cold Sri Lankan crabs, fish maw soup, duck stuffed with glutonous rice, stewed green mustard (vegetable) with mushrooms and yam paste for dessert. The steamed pomphret and cold crabs were very fresh and delicious. The hei cho was crispy on the outside, soft and succulent on the inside. The fish maw soup was very tasty. The duck was deep fried and yet the meat was still very tender. The glutonous rice filling tasted a little like bak chang with lots of chestnuts. The duck and the rice filling tasted yummy, but I must say, the combination is a little too rich for me.I enjoyed the food a lot and it brings back the nice childhood memories of Teochew food that my grandma prepared. I will definitely return for more authentic Teochew food
