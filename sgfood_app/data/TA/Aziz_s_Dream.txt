Super collections of the veg and non veg food all around you is the taste and its services. Staff were looking after you perfectly and very welcoming. Just in case of the location is bit tricky through around the road of the corner.

Lovely prata with delicious spicy fish curry and tea tarik. The place seems to have lost its charm. Very quiet. Even the furniture layout not welcoming. While the food may be heaps of variety, the management needs to work to make it a more vibrant diner
