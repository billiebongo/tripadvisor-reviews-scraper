Dark and sexy interior. Attentive, engaged, knowledgeable staff. “Welcome back” card a nice touch. Expensive. (S$250 for two with no alcohol.)Date butter was as moorish as I had heard. Bread served with it was okay (but on the cusp of being a little dry/stale). Beef tartare amuse bouche was enjoyable/tasty. Wouldn’t order again, tho - 10 dollars a bite and not memorable (generically spicy - not as comforting as a simple, thick-cut French-style tartare). Burnt carrots and sprouts with dumplings were both 5/5 dishes. Lovely. “Main” was 300 grams of lamb. Well cooked (soft/fall apart) and flavoured but heavy with no sides / sauces to contrast with the salt/umami/rub of the lamb. Would have been excellent served WITH our vegetable plates (see above) but was a little too much served alone. Neither of us wanted to finish it, despite not being full. Sago + liquid nitrogen dessert thing. Amusing showcase - lots of dry ice fog. Needs a sharper flavour to cut against the coconut and rose - passionfruit? The mango didn’t quite do the job. Result is nice but a bit bland - again, can’t say it was in any way a “bad dish” but didn’t want to finish it (and stopped by a fruit aunty stall afterwards). Would come back / revisit Artichoke to compare. Similar food (dissimilar settings)

The Ottomani is hidden behind a restaurant/bar called Fat Prince. Very confusing.That aside, no other negative comments as The Ottomani is spectacular.Great décor, a fairly dark yet radiant interior. Comfy seats.Great and knowledgeable staff, seamlessly guiding us through the menu.And what a menu. We knew we were in for a treat when the smoked date butter came with the bread. The smoked date butter would have been a great appetizer on its own. The cabbage sprouts, burnt carrots and the pumpkin were all great. We had a few more dishes also, but my absolute favourite dish was the lamb shoulder, even though it was very expensive. The meat was so tender and tasty.A good wine list, also a bit expensive, but we did select a very nice French red wine.Overall, a truly great experience which should be best shared with a group of people so that you are able to get your knife and fork into as many dishes as possible

It was the four of us and we had a very enjoyable night out. Great attentive service, tasty and original food, a cocktail trolley going past your table and a wonderful ambiance with the right furniture, lighting and soundtrack. Afterwards, the adjoined bar Fat Prince is perfect for a few last drinks.Yes, it's pricey (food + wine) so this is likely one for special occasions but it will give you a great night out. Including food, wine and cocktails our bill for four came to about $650

Went for a birthday dinner here. Ambience was great - comfortable seating & (just) right lighting. Very interesting menu - Could not try the lamb or wagyu as i was the only meat eater and the portions left were too big. Tried the Salmon, Scallops, Burnt carrots, Potatoes, beef kebab and the chocolate cake. Food was brilliantly done, however, i found the portions were way too small for the price being charged. I'll save going back here only for a very very special occasio

i do love the restaurant setting.very nice light and deco, it is perfect if you want to bring someone dating and try to impress her. the waitress are very well trained. the design of the place is very modern middle east. it remind of my Oman stay.now lets talk about the food: we ordered kingfish/scallop/brussel sprout/quail/lamb. the kingfish was really tiny piece, unfortunately it was not something i would be impressed by, not only because of the size, but also the flavor---it is a little weak ie no real taste among it. the Scallop was better. certainly i feel the kingfish is not worth ordering.Brussel sprout is strange but tasty mixture of cheese, vege, nuts and gnocchi. that is a dish worth remembering and i have to say it is creative and unique taste. i quite like it.Quail started with plain taste but well prepared , the meat just nicely cooked in pinkish colour. but the quail meat has to be eaten together with the mixed vegetables served on the plate. start of the dish is quite plain but later you will feel its slowly bring out the quail nature flavor.Lamb... mmm...what a pity, probably one of their well prepared food been cooked 14hours. meat is bit dry and without sauce its just so hard to eat. i would recommend chef to add some source or just simply put side source to match with the lamb. you only taste the meat simply without taste ---so for this lamb, it is not worth the money.the last the best---- the goat milk sorbet with berries---really really really excellent! the ice-cream is very light and not too sweet with berries and some crunchiness with the flakes! i would say over all the dishes, the dessert is the best of all.if i have to give my recommendations with top score of 10: scallop(7),brussel sprout (8), goat milk sorbet (10), quail (8), lamb (5~6), kingfish(4~5).not including the wine, the food cost about 300bucks which i think is on expensive side in singapore. but certainly i would expect better food than what they serve.overall experience is still good as i really like their deco and atmosphere.one thing i think they do really good: burn some wood and bring the room with some woody smell

This has got to be my new fave restaurant! It's warm, cozy and sexy ambience makes it very inviting. Great service (which is hard to come by in SG), good food and awesome drinks! Def recommend ordering the super tasty cabbage sprouts and the pork dish. Lamb dish was good and so was the leafy salad. Overall great first experience and can't wait to come back!

A business colleague and I had dinner at the Ottomani. It is located on the back side of the Fat Prince and I imagine the upscale part of the same restaurant. I previously visited and enjoyed the Fat Prince, so when my colleague suggested the Ottomani, I expected an even better food. The website declares that it is a "unique experience and a totally fresh take on a cuisine you thought you knew." While the place is elegant, with nice ambiance, the food was far from good. We ordered a few first courses to share. Salmon Pastirma (fancy name for fish pastrami), Kebab Tartare, Mum's Triangles and Cabbage Sprouts. Except for the cabbage sprouts, which was very good, the rest of the dishes were average and below. The Pastirma too thick such that the salmon was not clearly recognized. The Kebab Tartar was hiding under an orange cover of a perforated thin wafer with some caviar on top. The tartar itself was rather tasteless. The Mum's Triangles, which looked visually appealing, were supposed to be a form of Boureki were reasonably good. But, they were too thin so there was little room to put the filling in them and there was not much to taste. The big issue, however, was the main course. We ordered 400 grams of a shoulder of lamb (you pay by the 100gr) which we were told was slow cooked for 14 hours. The meat we received was hard, full of ligaments and fat and most certainly not cooked for long. The many spices put on top did not help. We sent it back. The restaurant manager came and apologized and took the lamb off our bill, but the experience killed the entire meal. We were given a desert as compensation and it was rather decent. Tere were a few good things about the Ottomoni aside from the beautiful decor and the nice ambiance. The service was good and attentive. The wine list is pretty decent even though not extensive and the drinks we ordered were properly and professionally done. All in all, I would not go back or recommend the Ottomani because any restaurant should first provide good food, especially when they declare that they bring you new and unique experience

This restaurant was outstanding and unique. From the table side crafted cocktails to the delicious food and very friendly service this is a great place to experience something different and outstanding. Credit to the chef for his fusion take on Middle Eastern food with Asian flavors. High quality dishes and abundance of flavors make each dish delectable. We loved the space, the vibe, the candle lit dining room and of course the food. This is a must in Singapore

Great Dining experience, great food & perfect ambience. Ideal setting for an intimate dining experience, but good for families too like we had. Love the personal touch of welcome card by the manager.
