Good food with great prices is the best combination. Coupled with their good service, can we ask for more ? The Crab Bee Hoon is a must try and do make reservation unless you dont mind sitting along the outside w/o aircon.

Been trying beehoon crab in few places in singapore, i personally think this one is the best so far. Perfectly cooked crab combined with the thick super flavorful broth is just heavenly. The broth is silky smoothy with strong wok burnt smell that add another layer to the flavor, to have beehoon with that broth is just great. Really enjoy eating this dish.

Specialising one dish in particular, namely Crab Bee Hoon, Long Ji does it better than any other I've tasted. Full of "wok hei" (the special toasty flavour from having been wok fried over high heat), meaty Sri Lankan crabs, crunchy fried pork cracklings and a robust soup-broth, this dish alone is well worth the trip.

Long Ji is famous for their crab bee hoon so needless to say, we had to try it. The crab meat was succulent and fresh. We also tried other dishes such as beancurd with pumpkin sauce, coffee spare ribs, green dragon vegetable with bean sprouts. We had a hearty meal and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Prices were more than reasonable and some of the dishes were priced at or below prices charged by zi char stores in coffee shops. I will definitely be back

It’s a dry crab bee hoon but there’s enough creamy sauce to give the noodles a lovely flavourful taste. The noodles themselves are springy and not too soft. And the crab is fleshy and full of flavour too. You’ll be digging out every last piece of flesh. The veg we had to accompany the crab was also delicious it was a called dragon vegetable and was cooked in a garlic sauce that wasn’t too strong but still tasty. Overall it was a lovely meal and felt like it was great value as the crab was reasonably priced.

A friend arranged to meet us here for dinner and we were just thrilled with the food! We had many dishes (my wifes friends always order too much food haha!) But the Crab Bee Fun stood out! Gorgeous crab in a flavorful broth with rice noodles...I am getting hungry thinking of it now.... Fried rice, Braised Tofu with Vegetables, Garlic sautéed Kai Lan (Chinese Broccoli) were all excellent

While in Singapore I had to chance with my husband to meet up with two local friends for some delicious eats. With a quick run down of my dietary needs, we ordered a feast for all four of us to enjoy.We, of course, ordered their famous crab bee hoon and also salt egg (i think it was the pork), venison with ginger and spring onion, crispy squid, and sambal kangkong. All the food we enjoyed was delicious and we all left very full and happy. You can't beat that

Very fantastic crab beehoon. The stock is very rich and with plenty of "chu yau char". The crab is very fresh because of the high turnover of this famous dish. And the beehoon is fried with very good "wok hei". Highly recommended for a very satisfying meal. The salted egg yolk pumpkin too deserves a mention. Very crispy batter and great tast

Went for dinner with a friend. Ordered crab bee hoon, a veg and a tofu dish. I requested for small portions for all dishes as there were only 2 of us. The waiter said there is only a standard portion for the crab bee hoon and when the portion was HUGE, enough for 4-6 people!!! Though there is only 1 crab in the dish, it probably came with 1 full packet of the typical bee hoon that you can get from the local supermarket. Fortunately we managed to cancel the tofu dish. Tried as we might, we couldn't finish the bee hoon and was stuffed. The crab bee hoon was great though the crab itself was a tad dry. Dish was not cheap though ($68). Will come back but probably with a larger group.
