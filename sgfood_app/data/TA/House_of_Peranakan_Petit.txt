It's a newly open place and I went there with my family and we had great dinner together. The food was amazing and delicious! Especially the desert!

Our foodie neighbor recommended this restaurant as we had some foreign guests in town. It was a delightful experience. Service was good. Décor is warm and cosy. Food is very yummy. We loved the Assam Baby Squid, Scallop Lemak and their desserts!

I was there with 9 ex colleagues. A good catch up with great food. A wide choice of peranakan cuisine and cosy ambience. Nice place for small group and convenient near outram mrt.

I had Assam prawns, Sambal ladies fingers and chendol with durian. It was a sensational meal! The service was quick, friendly and efficient and the food was so tasty!

I enjoyed a good dinner here but found portion sizes small, as mentioned in other reviews. Singapore prices are high for sit down restaurants (with Canadian dollar being low) but I have enjoyed eating here in the past and came back. I had a pleasant meal but didn't add drinks or desert to my bill. The staff are very pleasant and food quality very good

In a city of excellent restaurants this was our favourite meal . Very inexpensive , hearty food . The flavours of each dish had depth and complexity , all subtly different . The highlights were the crayfish curry , otak and ngoh hiang . The durian cendol for dessert was nice too .We took a taxi from Marina Bay Sands for $10

Excellent food served at the cosy and smart restaurant. Was with friends and we had the fish Assam (delicious), chap chye (excellent), fish soup n otak. The lemon ginger tea was very fragrant. And the coconut ice cream with the sago was the perfect end to the evening. Pricey for some maybe, but value for a great evening - priceless! We'll done

Dinner for 3 at 830pm. Fortunate that there was a spare table. Ordered beef rendang, curry crayfish, scallop lemak, ladyfingers sambal and itik tim. Small portions, we could have variety. Every dish was good, especially the crayfish and beef noodle. Itik tim soup was so soothing. Dessert was cendol with durian purÃ©e and ice-cream - without shaved ice! - the way I like it. Bill came up to 144. So worth it.

As a former Sing resident i had developed a love of durian desserts which are now quite hard to find. We enjoyed a superb lunch of crayfish noodles, assam scallops and crayfish at this unpretentious local. The durian chendol dessert was a superb end to a most enjoyable meal

Service is fast and waiter is friendly. However, food portions are way too small! One piece of ngor hiang is priced at $12, cut into 6 one-inch pieces so one inch piece cost $2 each!!! We ordered chap chye ($10 for servings enough for two paxs) etc I can go on... Certainly not value for money

Tiny and cute restaurant cooking Peranakan traditional food. I just found that the beef wasn't tender at all but for the rest it was nice. Service is not very smiley and could be improved.
5
It is recommended by a colleague ,very clean and nice atmosphere, authentic Peranakan food, small portion but good tasted with both spicy and non spicy choices.

A very small and quaint restaurant at tiong bahru. Nice decorations and friendly staff. Food is mediocre and slightly overpriced. Reservation is recommended as it is a very small restaurant.
5
This is definitely a worth try - the peranakan food was authentic. We had ngor hiang, ayam buah keluak, soup and chap chye. The Ayam buah keluak is a must try - buah keluak was stuffed with minced meat and the gravy was superb! Thanks to the waiter for expediting our food as the restaurant was fully booked and we had to leave within 45 minutes (which is actually sufficient) and that makes this experience even better

I visit Singapore on business every other month for several weeks each time. I love food from all cultures locations and genres. This restaurant is my absolute favourite. As far as I'm concerned it is literally the best restaurant in Singapore. And there are so many excellent places to eat! The place is charming. Small and friendly. Everything I have tried on the menu has been spectacularly good. I am addicted to the spicy deep fried squid starter. An explosion of fabulous flavours. The proprietors and staff are so lovely. I beg anyone living in or visiting Singapore to try this wonderful restaurant. Great food. Great service and fantastic value. Best regards Richard Burke

First time visit to this jewel in Tiong Bahru overwhelmed us with the rich cuisine of the Peranakan. The authentic ingredients of the local kitchen are composed in a marvellous way and surprised us from dish to dish. We had pretty much a full sample of the menu to share it among the table. I attach a few photos as I do not recall all names. Show them to the waiter and order it, you will not regret. Decoration is interesting, service very friendly and fast, pricing very reasonable (less than 50SGD/person including one bottle of wine at the table

A slightly hidden resturant off the main eating and tourist hubs. The resturant is a bright green hidden behind a temple in a quite street of Singaporean row houses. Best way to get there is cab...about 10 min from MBS. The food is Peranakan...which is Malay Chinese fusion. This type of cuisine was born out of the history of Chinese and Malays intermarriages in the colonial days of Singapore. This restaurant is run by a family and has a great cozy vibe and very decently priced. We were a group of 3 and had about 5 dishes and desert for around 50 SGD each. It was our first time so we took suggestions...the ice cream with caramel and sago dessert was a winner, and the,lady fingers, crab soup and beef randang and the spring roll type appetizer. The fresh teas also a good complement. Note the food is quite spicy but there are also non spicy options. Reccomend a try

We walked to the restaurant which is in the heart of Tiong Bahru. It is rather small and seats max 20 inside. We had the Ngoh Hiang, Chap Chai, beef rendang, chicken buah lak, fish with sambal. Good service and if you bring wine the corkage is $20 per bottle.
3
We had the Chicken Buah Keluak, Chap Chai and a Sambal Fish dish (I don't remember the proper name). Growing up, I had Nyonya food all the time especially in Peranakan households. I suppose this place would be great if my tastebuds were not so discerning. The Chap Chai and Sambal Fish tasted wrong to me and my dining companion. We really wanted to like this place but we were quite disappointed. Service was good even though there appeared to be only one server

This tiny venue delivers big flavour in a beautiful homely location and for a reasonable price. The menu offers a lovely range of peranakan cuisine, including vegetarian options, drinks and truly delicious desserts. (The ubi kayu was heavenly!)Staff were very polite and attentive throughout the meal. To sum up, a lovely quiet neighbourhood restaurant which delivers on its promise of delicious peranakan food
5
Very cosy Peranakan restaurant close to the Tiong Bahru marked. The chicken clay pot and the Assam/Tamarind fish and prawns are musts.
4
This is our first time trying out this place and we enjoyed the okra dish and among others including the dessert options. Give this place a try if you haven't already done so.

A small tidy and nice decoration restaurant in Tiong Bahru, recommended by local friends. Location is not convenient but easy to find. Need to book for friday night. Food not bad and small size, taste good and many choices. A nice place for gathering and the environment is comfortable, will come next time

Having recently stayed in the Tiong Bahru area, we were pleasantly surprised to discover a number of little gems....and House of Peranakan Petit is one. Situated just off Tiong Bahru Road in Eng Hoon Street the restaurant is on the bottom floor of a typical shophouse. It serves (and appears renowned for} Nyonya food. There are about 30 seats including a couple outside.We can report that on each occasion we walked past this restaurant was busy. On the evening we visited (a Wednesday) there was not a spare seat. Fortunately, a table was about to be available so we had a very brief wait outside. In the hour plus that we were there as tables emptied they filled, and mostly by people who seemed familiar with the hosts......obviously regular customers.The small room is quaint without being exciting. The seating although close did not feel intrusive. Neither the menu nor the drinks (wine) list were extensive.The senior lady host (presumably with an interest) was very accommodating. Our order was taken and the food arrived efficiently. Our starter, spring rolls were not the standard Asian fare but with great flavour. He settled on the Beef Rendang which was moist and spicy and an adequate serve. She had the Assam Babi Calamari (stir fried in tamarind, onions green chilli and other Asian spices). The serve was adequate but to our mind there was too much batter and not sufficient calamari and the flavour might have been more robust?We finished the meal with lychee tea...delightfully refreshing.We felt that we had experienced a typical small family local restaurant in suburban Singapore and were satisfied by the experience. I have to return to experience Scallop Lemak (the "curry scallops")

I’m a fan of Asian food, including Peranakan (Nyonya) cuisine, so a friend advised me to go try House of Peranakan Petit, in the heart of historic Tiong Bahru. The story behind the restaurant is that the Chef, Bob Seah, wanted to share his family’s culinary culture, and the homey atmosphere, welcoming service, and authentic dishes attested to that. I started with the highly recommended Scallop Lemak: The sauce, coconut and curry, was tasty but not too overpowering so that I could still taste the juicy texture of the scallops. My colleague took the Babi Assam, a pork belly stewed in a chili paste of bean paste, which was also scrumptious! We were feeling daring, so we finished with the Durian Chendol, paired with coconut ice cream - a surprisingly delicious mix. Looking forward to my next visit

Delicious traditional recipes of Perakanan cuisine, that could be considered the more ancient "asian fusion" cuisine in the world. We tried two different main courses, one with beef, the other with chicken, and it's hard to decide which was better... both were totally delicious! The restaurant is little but clean and cozy, the service good and even quite fast, for such complex recipes.Very, very recommended

Invited some friends from Shiraz, Iran and they loved this place as much as we did. It is very homely, no frills, non-fanciful place. The food was good and value for the price. The ambience is relaxed, you feel like you are at home.The wine list is rather limited, but I would not worry about it
5
Having never eaten Peranakan food before (and to be honest, having never even heard of Peranakan food before) eating at the House of Peranakan Petit was a fun experience!We visited this restaurant during a long-weekend in Singapore as we were staying nearby and had read good reviews. When we arrived at the restaurant it was completely full so I'd recommend booking a table in advance. The host offered us a beer and a seat outside whilst we looked at the menu and waited for some other customers to settle their bill. This felt like a really nice touch.We loved the chicken with fermented black nuts (Ayam Buah Keluak), though maybe not the best choice if you aren't a fan of spicy food!The service was efficient and friendly and the small restaurant had a very homely feel.I'll definitely be looking out for Peranakan restaurants in the future

The marketing spiel on the menu says they have 20 years of culinary experience. We went for the waiter's suggestions on their Signature dishes.... Babi Ponteh (Pork dish), Chicken Buah Kualak, Chap Chai (Mixed Vegetables) and Otak Otak (Fish Cake). Peranakan is a mixed race of early Chinese settlers and the local Malays and strong influences of both cultures can be seen in their food, traditions and architecture. The centre of Peranakan culture is Melaka in Peninsular Malaysia. The restaurant has limited seating with a nice Peranakan ambience. I would suggest pre-booking seats. There something Spanish playing in the background and I thought this was a little out of place. Portions are small but ideal for two. Cost was mid range but I felt not really value for money. It was a one-time experience and not likely a repeat

I always have a special fond of the Peranakan culture and its cuisine, and I am glad that I found "House of Peranakan Petit" - a little gem at the up and coming hip neighbourhood of Tiong Bahru.I made the reservation one week in advance of my visit, and was promptly confirmed by the third generation owner, Bee Leng - a sincere young lady with cheerful smile as her grandma who passes along the secret recipes.We tried the signature dishes - Selar Sambal Fish, Assam Prawns and Itek Sio (braised duck), and they are all delicious especially the Sambal and Assam sauces. We were unable to resist the dessert - Cendol with Durian and Icecream, which made us happy souls with full stomachs.Definitely coming back!!
