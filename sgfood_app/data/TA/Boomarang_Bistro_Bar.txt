Good food good vibes.
Came here on a Sunday afternoon (2pm) and it seems they were pretty packed and were bustling with activities. Most of the patrons here are expat families so do expect to have kids on the next table screaming their lungs out.
5
Arrived in Singapore on Australia Day. Perfect day to visit an Aussie bar. It was packed with people. We visited again for dinner and it was still popular. Food was great and there was plenty of it.
5
Came for breakfast. Great food and service and good atmosphere. We were staying at The Fullerton Hotel so very handy just round the corner.
4
Loved being able to watch some of the NCAA Championship game here -- one of the few places in Singapore that show something other than cricket or rugby. Cold beers. Decent snacks.
4
3 Day stopover prior to cruise, we found the Boomerang Bistro at Robertson Quay to have a varied menu at reasonable prices for Singapore. The food was very good served by friendly staff, the choice we both made was very nice and well presented. The alcohol prices were steep, but for Singapore reasonable. We enjoyed our meal in relaxing surroundings and would recommend a visit when in the area
4
Boomerang is a great place to dine and drink and watch the sport on the big screens or just watch the world go by.A vast range of typical pub fare and Aussie favourites.I had the snapper which was good value and tasty especially with the extra vegetables on the side.As always the beer is cold and lots of choices for other drinks.Drop in for a nice time
4
Visited with my partner last week to catch the 2nd ODI between England and Australia at the Gabba.Large, open plan bar, with lots of screens; (Melbourne tennis on one, Cricket on the other) and lots of fans to stay cool in that wicked humidity. Servers very attentive and drinks were plentiful and ice cold.Food coming out of the kitchen looked great and we ordered two Aussie Steak sandwiches which were really nice.Would recommend for anyone wanting to watch sports or looking for a place to chill in Robertson Quay
3
I came here with my family for tea and I went with the WAGYU burger! It was enjoyable but I'd say it looks better than it tastes! Seeded bap was great just the actual meat in the burger lacked flavour. Good place for a chilled vibe, drinks and bar food!
3
We took a stroll along Robertson quay and called in here on Christmas day fur lunch and a bucket of beer. Nothing special and service was not the quickest but it was okay. Like many places here the prices are high for alcohol but the menu choice was good and they were also doing a Christmas menu. If you can sit outside you can do some nice people watching

If I could give this less than one star I would...Visited Boomarang over the weekend (as I have done many times with numerous different groups of friends) with some friends visiting from abroad ... over numerous hours spent here we managed to rack up a bill of over $500 - once we got given the bill we noticed there were a couple of beers too many so we questioned why there were a few too many there. We approached a member of staff and we were rudely answered back to, only to find out that it was a so called ‚Äúmanager‚Äù (I won‚Äôt mention the name). She was giving attitude which no member of staff (certainly not a manager) should give to a customer (especially when they are spending over $500!). After settling the bill quickly out of embarrassment because it was causing a scene with being continuously told we were wrong, we were approached by a member of staff, Jack, he was verbally abusive to my friend for simply looking at him - he came over to our table and put his phone in my friends face while yelling he was going to call the police!! And then had to be taken away by another member of staff!! To my knowledge this is NOT customer service and isn‚Äôt even normal human behaviour!! I approached a different manager and was told she couldn‚Äôt do anything because he was a local and she was not - this too is unacceptable...(this manager was very helpful in this situation). I will not be returning to Boomarang at ANY of the outlets and certainly will NOT be recommending this restaurant to anyone I know. I hope the staff are improved and no incidents like this occur for anyone else.
3
Probably going against the Flow here. 3rd Visit,so it has had it's chance. Great location and always buzzing,but overpriced and don't think the food is that good and portions not that generous
4
Had a nice breakfast. Good range of western breakfast food. Nice ambience. Good river views. Enjoyable
4
You know the type of place, fast service drinks, good range of food (for all meals from breakfast to lunch to dinner) with big screen tv's and happy enough staff...
In a great location by the river and certainly an easy place to enjoy!
4
Sat right on Robertson Quay this popular place is in a great location. Atmosphere during sporting events is good with plenty of drink choices, recommend to book
Large open bar/restaurant. Good food and choices
Overpriced for what it is and staff are hit and miss
3
While staying at Robertson Quay we popped into Boomarang for lunch.
Good choice of food and wine at reasonable prices. The staff were very pleasant. Would recommend this restaurant.
5
Absolutely fantastic little restaurant/cafe. Amazing coffee and great service. Will recommend to family and friends üòä visiting from overseas.
2
I used this place most nights as my hotel was next door. I was on a budget and due to their price bought beer most nights. Food response and service average at best. Prices worse than most I came here for an Aussie Welcome and receiving apathy from local staff. Nearly 3 nights in a row. Crap. Go to Clark Quay or Boat.
4
I was staying in a hotel nearby but did not want to watch the Australian Socceroos final World Cup qualifier in my room and noticed this bar with many people wearing our national colours. It was a great atmosphere, beer and bar food tasted good but victory tasted sweeter! Certainly influenced the impression of the venue. Like to indoor / outdoor option common in this part of Singapore along the Quays. Would certainly visit again for similar occasion
2
Took family for leisurely lunch whilst in Singapore and our waitress looked like she was so not enjoying her shift that day as the non exsisent smile and service throughout the lunch was zero to say the least as we had to keep asking for everything.Food was average and the Linguine Florentine was so tasteless & lacked flavour I could have been eating cardboard to be honest and seriously we had two good bottles of Dry Riesling with other dishes and the bill was near to 300.00 Singapore Dollars.The cost was not cheap and to add 10% Service Charge is laughable if I wasn't with family and friends I would have complained and offered to give the staff a days training on customer service skills.Sorry but won't be hurrying back this side of ever !!
3
The restaurant is located right on the river walkway. The TVs have some good sports bar viewing. The food was not great. If you are going out for a meal, there are many better places. If you want a drink and some sports, it will do fine
5
dropped by for a quick coffee after lunch - they have a decent selection of coffee. what impressed us more was the service - prompt, polite, even serving us water (without prompting) after our coffee. would come back again.
3
We stopped by for a few beers and a lunchtime feed. Food was ok, good simple selection. Service was excellent and we were able to watch a couple of Australian sports live on the multiple large TV's.
1
Back for a visit, my friends thought it would be good to go to an ‚ÄòAustralian‚Äô restaurant after dinner for some drinks. The wait staff were abrupt, unfriendly and not helpful at all. 2 pots of tea (‚Äòno coffee‚Äô was all he said when we were seated and asked if they served coffee) were served, after we had to ask for drink as well as food menus. Then we had to ask for sugar and milk, with the waiter looking as if I owed him a million dollars. We also ordered calamari n 2 coronas. All were served with a stoic face and each time we thanked them, we were ignored.It was pretty disgusting that a F&B outlet would have staff that are so aloof. My friends worked in the hospitality industry and we agreed that we have not met such bad service. Ever. Would I recommend you to go? No. Baked potato was served with no gravy. Bug crawled out of the salt shaker. Even when making payment, not even a ‚Äòthank you ‚Äò seriously if u r so unhappy with only 2 tables of customers, don‚Äôt open till 3am. Just close shop and go home. I get better service from my neighbourhood hawkers. The least they do is offer me a smile. We smiled plenty and we used all our ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù
4
Stopped here for breakfast on our way out for the day. Ordered The Ashes (full breakfast) and it was lovely and very filling. Didn't need to eat again until evening. Staff were very friendly and helpful. They constantly came around topping up our complimentary water. Boomarang is located along the river front
5
We started in McGettigans but they were not showing the Australian A League (although it was on their list of events). Over to Boomerang where we were warmly welcomed and staff went out of their way to get us 2 seats very quickly..we had a great view of 2 screens showing SFC v Wanderers and Wallabies v All Blacks. Plenty of high definition screens around. Great friendly service and lovely food...we had the smashed avocado with feta and the linguine bolognese. Both really fresh and tasty. Will definitely be back
2
Short waiting times and friendly service staff.The food itself is really poor. Everything tastes wrong, like the chefs have never actually tried the food they are trying to make. Reminds me of those medieval artists who painted weird pictures of tigers based on third party descriptions. Good location. Nice play to watch the footy. Awful place to eat.
4
If you are going with friends/family to watch sport it is greatI have not been for a number of years for breakfast/brunch so visited as always liked the menuMenu the same and was happy to have the Ashes breakfast. Plates are smaller with food piled on top of each other. Scrambled eggs I left as tasted of rubber, the sausage was awful. Bacon, hash brown, mushrooms etc goo
5
Watched the NRL grand final on Sunday here. Great to feel the atmosphere, watch the game, sing the Aussie anthem!Visited with our teenage daughter. Lots of families with young kids too.Had "bucket of beers" - not our normal thing to order but was S$50 for 5 beers or otherwise S$15 per beer. Also had S$16 dip plate - really nice for selection of 3 dips, breads, etc. Also ordered wedges which were nice too.Tip - if wanting to watch a popular game make sure you book a table. We were lucky enough to be able to share a table with another family otherwise we would have missed out.Had a great afternoon - if only the result had gone our wa
4
Would you like to hang out as a couple on a romantic, quiet evening? Don't go here. Do you want to watch rugby, formula 1, football, or any other sports with friends and/or spouse, this is the perfect place. Would you like a bustling atmosphere and buckets or draught pints of beers. This is again the Perfect place. A lot of Ozzies, who are always fun and full of laughter, and other expats. Is it loud? Yes. Annoyingly so? No. Downside, the food. Portions are big, but quality is much less so.Highly recommende
4
In Singapore there are not many sports bars showing rugby union matches. So this becomes a useful place for rugby fans, specially tourists.Food and drinks are reasonable, atmosphere nice enough to enjoy a game of rugby. Best tables tend to be reserved off quite fast. Better book one day in advance
4
Hard to find a good western breakfast place other than at hotels or Burger King.
Boomerang hit the mark with a great breakfast range and first class coffee (even by Melbourne standards).
Very relaxing watching the river with people strolling by.
3
I came here with a new friend for a couple of drinks. It was 6pm on a Wednesday and there were only two other tables occupied. If you want a bit of space, it was good.
5
Watched the AFL and was not disappointed apart from the result. Plenty of screens to watch the game and the food was bar room standard. Not terrific but OK, No problems with the staff more than friendly. Beer prices or on average for Singapore,
4
I've eaten here four times now, having something different every time, and have always been happy with the quality of the food. There is a wide variety to choose from. Even the pizza is good.The atmosphere varies depending on whether there is a popular sporting fixture on the TV, it can be a bit quiet if there isn't
5
Stopped here because I read they have a lot of sports on, got lucky and they had the college football game I wanted to watch, the only issue is I paid 61SGD for three pints of beer. That's roughly 40 American dollars, for what would cost 15-18 bucks back in the states. I didn't have any food, but it looked good. Great area and service was spot on.
3
Was at Boomarang in Boat Quay for an evening with friends. They have multiple TVs screening different sports - ideal to catch a cricket match!We ordered smaller plates to share - the smashed Avocado was average, the Hummus was a lot better. I wouldn't go back for the food, but a quick drink and/or a game, probably
3
Found this place via the internet when looking for somewhere to watch our AFL team while away, and discovered the local rugby population had prebooked all the tables near the big screens. The waiter 'let us' stay there until the booking time which was around the end of our game anyway, and we enjoyed the fun of watching out team from afar. Bar snacks as you would expect, drinks at local prices too. A pity about the smoking though, being used to it banned now from outdoor eating areas in Melbourne. When the rugby loving Brits arrived to claim the table they were gracious enough to let us stay on. Good times
1
It's a great place if you're white. If you're Asian be prepared to be treated like second class. While many tables were reserved, the reservation placards could be removed and table were given to Caucasian customers first. Asian customers either waited in queue or were told table were reserved and turned away.
4
Great place to find a cocktail in the wee small hours of the morning. Stellar oscillating fans make outdoor dining a delight. Delicious pizza, but steer clear of the humus which tastes like someone took a potato masher to a can of chickpeas (no garlic,lemon,tahini, etc)
5
Went for a long stroll around Raffles plaza and stumbled across this place. As you can expect by the way - it might be a little swayed for the Aussies - but the locals still attend and when the football isn't on, pretty quiet.I went there for breakfast and really enjoyed it. Coffee was excellent
3
Www er just passing and decided to stop by for a drink and something to eat. Not very impressed with the food or beer, quite average. Yet this place was extremely busy maybe they need more staff to cater for this
3
The meals where the typical bar meals, nothing special and at Singapore prices. A good place to watch an AFL game and have a few drinks
4
Breakfast at Boomarang is indeed a very fair representation of quality breakfast back in Australia. No complaints, decent coffee and attentive service (makes a change from Phuket!).
2
I went to Boomarang to watch the football (AFL) on a Sunday afternoon.They had one of their TVs showing the game I was interested in. There were many other screens - mainly showing a Rugby Union match. The place was pretty well booked out because of that rugby match (Australia wasn't one of the teams playing btw). Consequently I got a seat a long way from the screen and couldn't enjoy the game with the other fans.I ordered a beer - Pure Blonde (Australian beer). Now I know Singapore has high tax on alcohol and I expected to pay a lot. But $17 was a little hard to swallow.I drank my one beer and when finished I let the empty glass sit on the the table. After 30-40 minutes it was still sitting there empty - not one of the many staff there asked me if I wanted another.Another annoying think was the WIFI wasn't working. I quizzed two of the staff about it, but they didn't seem to care, saying its probably because the TVs all use the internet as a streaming service.I gave up and went to another bar to continue watching the football.I had to go looking for a staff member to pay my bill. It was like I was invisible
3
Made our way to BoomArang bistro and bar thinking we were going to enjoy a decent steak or seafood. There were very few diners compared to other eateries in area. And now we know why. After checking the menu we opted for the seafood basket for two @$48 and garden salad. The staff very keen to take food and drinks order. Drinks came and 10 minutes later our meal arrives. A huge basket filled with 2 pieces of "barramundi", calamari, crumbed prawns and underneath that layer wedges and chips. This was a very ordinary meal. Chewy calamari, cremated prawns and fish that my husband (big NT fisherman) says was suspect. Besides the salad everything else was left. When asked by staff if meal ok we told them it was overcooked and inedible. To their credit though they discounted our bill by 50%
3
Had lunch there today, the beers are still good but the food dropping down a level. Had the schnitzel which itself was a good portion but the mash was dry and the salad was a few sad leaves at best. Didn't even come with gravy, for some reason mayonnaise?? Needs to lif
3
Have been a few times and the place is never very full. This time it was just to meet colleagues for drinks and I did arrive quite late but except for us, it was empty.Robertson Quay is probably the quietest of all the Quay's along the river - this may suit some but I prefer it to be a little more busier
4
I visited there this morning about 10 am for breakfast. Set right on the banks of the Singapore River, Boomarang seemed a very popular place to visit seeing it had a fair crowd. I had the Coolangatta breakfast of a couple of fried eggs, sausage,bacon, hash brown and 2 slices of toast. Quick service and the the flat white coffee was terrific.The place is open from 7 am through to late and provides lunch and dinner. Good selection of meals including steaks (which are outrageously expensive in Singapore).Time has beaten me to try other meals but i note they get a coverage of Aussie sports through Setanta on quite a number of large screens throughout
2
We have been coming here for many years when visiting Singapore and feel this restaurant is going downhill fast. We shared a real rubbish seafood basket, tough squid, tasteless barramundi, over cooked crumbed prawns and greasy batter, we left about half of it. Mediocre Sav blanc at S$17++ adds insult to injury. The surrounds are looking very tired as is the service. A great disappointment
1
I went to Boomarang on a Saturday since a friend of ours wanted to go to a kid friendly place. Sure enough the place was packed with families and expats. Their brunch menu was very ordinary and quite over priced compared to other place that serve brunch. The egg Benedict I ordered was $17++ and when it arrived it just had a drop of hollandaise sauce! Not kidding!! Made me laugh and pls see the picture I attached with this review. The taste was very standard. The ham looked like a ready to eat ham u buy at a supermarket too. Staff here tend to be rude as well since I think they are always busy and rushing. I was asked by a waiter what I would like to drink and I replied "orange juice" and he did not seem to hear me because he is then shouted and asked again in a very aggressive tone. When they serve the food, everyone was engaged in a conversation so the staff started shouting our orders and she had a sour face while serving us. This place was disappointing in the end. I think better to come here if u want to have beer and watch games with your friends but don't come here for a catch up brunch or lunch. Lots of expats so I guess that's why it's a bit overpriced
3
Food was ok if nothing special. However the service was awful, nothing offer proactively from the order to the payment. Felt pretty much ignored - hardly a good Aussie welcome.
4
We had a great breakfast here. Took up back home. Loved the coffee and service was great. Food was quick to come out. It was $60 for 2 full breakfasts and 3 coffees.
3
Great place to watch rugby. If you want to watch football go elsewhere
Preferred the old layout as seems smaller now. Food is good but seating looking a little dated
4
We found this place tonight and we had two fish and chips . Two glasses of really nice wine and two pints of VB. all for less than $80. Good service and food at very reasonable prices. The problem is we fly out tomorrow!
4
We have been regularly visiting Boomerang at Robertson Quay since our arrival in Singapore last year. It's location by the river is lovely, the atmosphere always relaxed and the food of good quality. All ages are catered for so great for families.
4
A friend took us to this place over the weekend. Its a little bit of Aussie in Singapore. If you are a NRL or AFL nut then this is the place for you.
4
A typical Australian bar set up, comfort food and sports on the big screen. The food was good, fish and chips, pizza that type of food. Not fine dining, but didn't expect that.
2
More than 4 big screens, but no real bar seating, so we sit at a table outside. Ordered a steak and it was a good chunk of meat, and the sauce was great, but I ordered medium rare, the waiter repeated medium rare when he delivered the steak, and the steak was well done. For $52. Don't pretend that you're anything other than a place to watch Australian football and set yourself up for that instead
4
Being a Rugby fan from the UK I had to watch the England -v- Scotland RBS 6 Nations Game and so headed to 'the place' in Singapore for watching Live Sport... "Boomarang Bar". For big events like this you do need to reserve a table as it is probably the most popular place in Singapore for Ex-Pats to watch sport. I opted for the Boomarang Deluxe Pizza (large) and it was delicious and reasonably priced at SG$28 (GB¬£17), drinks however are very expensive at Boomarang! A bottle of Magners Apple Cider is a massive SG$17(GB¬£10.50), more than double what it would cost in a bar back in London... Then there is 7% GST (Tax) to add to that too!All in all a great place with a good atmosphere for watching Sport on the many massive LCDTV's, however make sure you go with a packed wallet as drinking here will soon empty it
5
I had "dinner" there last night. Wednesdays are great for beer. 2 for 1. A couple of pints of VB plus a pizza. This is an Australian bar. Conveniently located to where I've stayed in the past and where I am staying this visit to Singapore. There is a bunch of construction in the area, but you can still get to this place and it is open. I emphasize the sports on the multiple TVs. I was here several years ago when the Seattle Seahawks were playing a playoff game and was pleasantly surprised to see a bunch of Seahawks jerseys and the game on most, if not all, of the screens. They take their sports seriously here
5
Very good restaurant the food was fantastic thanks for the food I will come back to the restaurant soon bye thanks!!!
Written by my 6 year son Raahil who absolutely loves Boomerang!
3
Just stopped by for breakfast. Portions were good we had pancakes, toast and granola. Service was a bit leisurely but OK
4
Had a business meeting here and indulged in a few beers and watched some cricket. Reasonable place with good service but beer is too expensive.
4
Great location on Boat quay for lunch and watching the world go by, kid friendly , good food choice and reasonably priced
4
We went to this bistro with some friends last weekend. We brought our 10 months old baby and she loves it. Its an open space, just next to the river. We love it.
4
The place as hopping when decided to stop for cold beer and lunch.Sport bar the shows a lot of Aussie sport.Great river location.The food is good and relatively priced.
2
The food is not that great by local standards, for a westerner the food is ok. Actually my teenagers loved the food.. It is what you would expect from a sports bar in the US, burger, fried stuff,, grilled stuff.. eggs with stuff for breakfast..no real cooking at Boomarang The location is good for people in the area: in the heart of Roberson Quay, right on the river (expect heavy construction with jackhammers, 6 days a week. on both sides of the restaurant). you are paying the location markup despite the constructionPeople are friendly when they seat you, but the service is another story. The service is very slow once you are seated. We were there for 40 minutes after the food was served, and not once anyone checked to see if we needed anythingUnless you live or stay around Boomerang, there is no reason to visit, you can get better food, for a better price with much better service all over Singapor
5
We were here on holiday during the AFL season and wanted to see our team play. Went here and was surprised with the prices. Very reasonable for Singapore. The staff are mainly Australian and are very helpful. Even got to watch the game with a very well known AFL person. Great afternoo
5
Now one of my favourite bars. The meals were excellent and great value for money. At one stage my wife was ill for a day or so, the bar did up excellent meals that I was able to take away. Very friendly staff always willing to assist. A must visit for all Australian tourists visiting Singapore
5
To be honest, we only went here for breakfast, but we did 3 out of 4 days. The quality of the food is spectacular. I highly recommend the Country beans, they were brilliant. But between 3 of us, we tried 5 different breakfasts, they were all very goo
4
Nice bar restaurant good location shows sports cold beer and a good place to sit and watch the world go by.
4
Great place to sit and watch sport and the world go by along the river front . Service was great and the meal was good , basic but tasty. Dog friendly ‚ù§Ô∏è
4
Of the many bars in Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay, this one stands out. For one, it is open early enough for live NBA games during playoffs.
The cheese they use on their pizza is quite tasty! Would recommend trying the Ham & Pineapple
3
I went there for dinner with my family of 9. The food is really normal. I have had better kangaroo steak elsewhere. The price is consider high for a bistro.
The staffs are very helpful and friendly. The location and vibes is nice.
3
Been there couple of times, andPros :1. Food taste and quality are consistence. Love it each time.2. Price is better or cheaper compare to others.3. Ambiance is good. Good crowd too.Cons :1. Serving staff especially, are not accountable. Not very attentive. Like to chat within the staff and forgot to look around.2. We went on quite hard rainy day -- the drainage need to improve and plus some of the outdoor tables are not stable. Need some maintenance, feeling very shaky
3
Australian food at its best. Nice location along the river walkpath. Generous portions. The crew working the place is really unattentive. Place was half full at 8 pm on a Wednesday evening. People in the restaurant was wawing almost furiously to the 8 person strong staff but they were too busy chit-chatting with each other and cleaning tables
5
It was our first time here and we were very well satisfied with our food. They offer Australian food and we find it very satisfying. We ordered kangaroo meat pizza and it was great. The servings has huge portions which will satisfy your empty stomachs. We would be back here for sure! The location is nice though it is on the far side of The Quayside. It is a good place for families to dine
2
Ordered omelette with three fillings, brioche bun and sour cream (for a surcharge), chai latte and hot chocolate. The omelette was kinda burnt and dry (refer to the picture I have posted). You can't go wrong with eggs and I'm surprised that they have managed to prove me wrong. The chai latte was luke warm. I'm fine with paying more as the restaurant is located at Robertson Quay but for the quality of the food they serve, it's not worth it.
4
As we were out late and getting really hungry it was a pleasant surprise to come across the Boomarang Bar who even at 10:30 PM were happy to invite us in with open arms.The staff with there wide smiles and willing service toke our orders and the staff in the kitchen whipped up our tasty tasty meals with no fuss including our special order of steam vegies which may seem a simple request but has been followed by frowns and grunts in other establishments. Well done to all involved at this great eatery.
4
We visited the Boomarang from lunch and were quite happy with the food and ambiance. The bar is a great spot if you are into sport as there are large screens showing a variety of events, including cricket! Service is very good and the food we ordered was excellent. I highly recommend the steak sandwich, the steak was incredibly tender. The bar offers a variety of special deals such as schnitzel and beer at a discount, and I would advise you to look out for these as the prices are quite steep
3
Big TV screens for yesterday Rugby and Football matches. Hot wings was good, more room for improvement .
3
Coming from Australia, happened upon this restaurant and ate here due to hunger and connivence. It's overpriced and nothing like we would expect in cafes at home. Quite a basic serving for breakfast - something you could cook for yourself at home.
3
Attended this restaurant for lunch, the food was okay, I found the charges for fruit juice excessive a at $10 plus gst plus service charge mmmm. I guess checking all charges and prices is a must.
1
25 sgd for a sub par burger, 5 French fries and the most lame salad you could imagine, no dressing.
1 burger, 2 juices and a tea was 65 dollars.
Never again
4
I think the Boomarang is the place to go if you are a sports follower. Great large and numerous screens. Flat white coffee, teas, beer, all day breakfast. How can you go wrong. And my team won.
4
As a group of 12, we had a very nice meal here. It is typical Aussie food & is also very good for sport as there are huge screens showing sport to suit any sport lover. The fish & chips were delicious as were the steak sandwiches along with the burgers. There is something to eat for everyone of any age. Our group consisted of a 5 year old up to a 73 year old. All of us were very happy with what we had chosen. It is also very good for breakfasts. Definitely a must for all palates
5
Found this place on trip adviser, was looking for a decent Aussie breakfast and certainly found it. Its hard to find good breakfast in Singapore, a lot of the places don't open until lunch. Food was fantastic, great selection and perfectly cooked. I went there twice for breakfast and twice for dinner in the end and service and food was great. Coffee is good, wine selection outstanding. It is a bit expensive, but relative to Singapore and the quality I was happy to pay it. I would highly recommend this place. The Pavlova is a must try, almost as good as Mums :-
3
We visited this Australian restaurant at Robertson Quay and had a Trio Mushroom Pizza with portobello, shimeji, button, garnished with rocket and marinated cherry tomato with garlic and basil. We also had a Victoria Bitter. We were SO hungry after a small lunch earlier that day.The meal tasted quite good and so did the beer, but I didn't like the interior and the greasy spots on the tables in the restaurant. Why not clean the tables to make our experiences better when we are visiting?Look for more reviews by MulleEllum
3
It's an OK place, down by the river at Robertson Quay. Good range of beers, and you can buy buckets of five at a time - good for watching sports events. Standard pub food available. Service is a bit slow, and they struggled to cope with getting people seated yesterday - big crowd, and not enough tables. But the Bulldogs won, so it was all good in the end.
4
Went on recommendation of a friend. Did not realise we should have booked, it was packed out. The friendly and efficient staff found us a table with a view of the screen showing the game we wanted - they even anticipated enough to ask us which game we wanted to watch! First drinks order taken promptly, food order from a good bar menu taken promptly, food delivered hot and the servings were massive! Subsequent drinks orders a bit slow, probably due to the high patronage. Overall a very good experience and we would return if in Singapore again
5
Had a brilliant evening here watching the Adelaide Crows in the Elimination Final. There were about 6 - 7 screens showing various games...including AFL, NRL, EPL and the Wallabies. A great mix of people all enjoying a sporting evening.
5
If you like Sport with your basic but good food then this is the place to come. During the day it can have children and families but by evening it becomes a noisy bar when there's sport on the massive TVs.
4
Attended an office outing at the beginning of the month, about 10 of us in total , food was very traditional western , plenty of burgers , ribs, steaks to choose from , staff were very attentive and the beers kept flowing, would definitely recommend if you want a good night out with plenty of tv screens to watch the latest sporting even
4
Stopped for the happy hour which was fine, we ordered kids meals and they got colouring crayons and pictures. They had sports on the tv which my kids enjoyed watching and we had a sharing plate which was yummy. The service was only average, we had to keep asking for things and it was busy so hard to get the staffs attention sometimes

When I went to sit down, I was asked to move to one of the tall tables with stools. These aren't very comfortable and I should have moved on to another restaurant. I was handed the menu and told that there was still two minutes to order the special in a pushy way. I took three minutes to order something else for the menu. My choice was mushroom pizza which was okay but nothing great. The glass of wine helped dull the pain of the uncomfortable seating. It was obviously a slow night for sporting events because the half of TV screens still continued to show the special that night in case I had changed my mind. I had to ask for a glass of water and the servers made themselves busy with anything, but looking after the customers. Since the renovations this restaurant has gone downhill and I will walk by next time.
3
We chose it because it was advertising the English football match that we wanted to watch. The seating wasn't particularly comfortable, the food is nothing special and the drinks are very expensive (even by Singapore standards). It's a nice setting beside the river but really there are many better places to eat nearby
4
Visited here multiple times during a 3 day business trip. Tasted numerous dishes from their breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. All food and drinks were excellent. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Outside tables have comfortable padding seating, sunlight streaming in all day. Free WiFi for customers, and large TV monitors for those who wanted to watch sport. Food was a little pricey, but everything else made up for it
1
Nice service but food was terrible - asked for them to spice up our pizzas. This was either forgotten or ignored and the two pizzas we received were the blandest tasting we've ever experienced. Didn't finish and manageress gave us a rebate, which was the only plus from this experience
5
Both the portobello mushroom and mozzarella salad and the pumpkin and bocconcini salad were fabulous. I tried the watermelon and mint juice this time which was great too. The pizzas are really nice and the eggs and pancakes are a hot favourite. Highly recommend the place for a relaxed and fun brunch or even just for a drink. Can never get enough of it

The place looks nice, is quite big and offers a nice terrace only the river walkway which gives a bit of distraction if you're not into watching the games on TV. Overall it is a well executed concept.The drinks are expensive (then again it is Singapore) and the staff overall was very friendly and accommodating. They have beer specials where you buy a bucket of 5 for a greatly reduced price and every time I had 2 beers and ordered a third they would immediately offer to convert my order into the promotion, which was a nice touch (even though I didn't want / need 5 beers).The food was a bit of a hit and miss, I had read that they served big portions, which honestly wasn't at all the case, the portions were nice but by no means big. I had the medium rare Sirloin steak (because the one I wanted wasn't available), which came with a bare bones minimum of sides (you can only chose one so either you have some vegetables or some potatoes) and sauce. Having said that, it was well prepared and tasted quite good. It was a good steak but not really a good meal so I ordered chocolate cake to follow, which was also quite good.I returned the next day because I had noticed the Kangaroo loin on the menu, something which I'd never eaten before ... which turned into one big disappointment. Since I had never eaten it before I didn't stipulate how I wanted the meat cooked and they brought it medium rare to medium, which was clearly the absolute wrong way to cook this meat. It was chewy and rubbery, served with carrot mashed potatoes (ok), sauce and sour cream. Unfortunately due to preparation the meat was simply not up to par and I gave up halfway through the dish.It is obvious to me that this is meat that should be served rare, throw it into a hot pan, sear it and serve it immedately in thin slices; for an Australian bistro, this was seriously disappointing, it looks good in the picture and there was flavour there but as it was served doesn't quality as good food.I'm not sure if I'd go back on my next visit to Singapore, the location of the venue wasn't bad but there are plenty of choices in that area

Read about boomerang when looking for breakfast options for our visit to Singapore. Great breakfasts, good choices and service. Recommended
5
Great to be able to catch up on all sporting events in a relaxed ambience. It is right on the Quay so interesting spot for people watching. One of my favourite bars in Singapore.
4
As the title suggests.. Came here twice and on first occasion caught happy hour. Food was ok and reasonably priced. Drinks were good and atmosphere was ok. Good lac action for the park hotel.
4
Great place for breakfast if staying at the Miramar hotel. Good food , location and staff much nicer than hotel buffet restaurant.
3
Average meals priced accordingly. Good friendly service. Open early for breakfast. Located along the a Quay.
4
Caught up with some old friends and enjoyed great food and happy hour drinks. This place is huge and we had a great table outside right in the buzz of things.
3
The place was very busy when we arrived for brunch the other day, but we managed to find a table. The setting is perfect, right on the water at Robertson Quay.My choice (pancakes with bananas) was pretty average - quite dry and dense with only 1/2 banana sliced up over 3 pancakes. my husband had traditional eggs and bacon which he said were okay (but then again it is hard to really spoil fried eggs and bacon!), but although he had ordered a large latte, what arrived was only a small glass (even though we questioned it and was assured this was the large size), so I hate to think what the regular size is!) Australian sport was playing on the giant TVs which is I guess why Aussies tend to frequent the restaurant.I haven't been put off by the place, and will certainly try it again, but will definitely look at another choice
4
I just wanted to say that I had truly great dining experience. I must say the service is really outstanding. I don't remember the last time our expectations as guest in a restaurant were not just met. But exceeded. I had wagyu beef burger and happy hour red wine recommended by our server Michael. Michael was Friendly and genuinely hospitable. Excellent service! I just wanted to write to thank you all for the incredible dining experience. The food and the excellent service.Thank you we I most certainly dine with you again soon
4
Central location on Boat Quay, just up from Clark Quay. Multi screen sports bar, which shows a wide range of sport most nights. Stopped in here to watch the F1 and had a very good burger and a pint. No more expensive than the rest of Singapore
2
If you're desperate to watch the AFL, NRL, or Rugby then you can guarantee you can watch it at this place, great spot on the quayside and lovely bars and restaurants surrounding it. Unfortunately it may seem that this is not a nice place to work, all the staff that we encountered were rather unfriendly and we didn't see a smile from staff for the 3 hours we were there. The customer service was lacking eg. we asked for a drinks menu and then waited 20 minutes and still no one came to take our order, in the end we went to hunt down the staff and the cocktails that arrived were average. I think the management/owners need to invest in building the employee engagement and levels of customer service to make real improvements
4
Live boardcast of sports events with multiple big screen tvs. Great coffee imported from Australia. Good food woth reasonable price and portion.
4
Stopped in as one of Singapore's regular downpours was about to begin. Nice breakfast, good real coffee and pleasant staff. Was about 1030 in the morning so not crowded.
4
Serving a really nice selection of main courses, was really excited to try the steak, was not disappointed with the portions and quality. Would definitely go back again.
5
Great Spot for Australian Expats and Tourists who want to watch their favourite footy team. You can get a real taste of Australia which Chicken Parmas and Big Breakfast's being served. Plenty of big screen TV's showing plenty of sports.
5
The restaurant is located in the Robertson Quay Area, we had a gone their with family for breakfast with kids with us. It serves delicious breakfast and has a good ambiance to sit and enjoy morning breakfast.
4
Being Qlders we wanted to watch state of origin whilst in Singapore so chose this Australian bar. We had a great time. Food was nice, nothing to rave about but decent. The atmosphere in the bar was great and everyone was enjoying themselves. Facilities were clean and they were very efficient considering how busy this bistro was. It is definitely not fine dining food but was what you would expect from a bistro/bar
3
Wagu beef burgers were ok.Antipasto was unusual with hot vegetables and of a size suitable as a small main. It was missing the advertised semi sun dried tomatoes.The half roast chicken was over cooked and dry and hence quite disappointing.The "parma deluxe" pizza was "the best".So overall, the food was viewed as having mixed quality. Price was reasonable with our dishes between $18 to $25
4
While strolling along the quay, we happened upon Boomarang Bistro and Bar and were stopped by a staff member asking if we were in search of lunch. She took us over to the host (ess) stand and showed us a menu while talking about how great the place was. The menu looked pretty good with items ranging from coconut crumbed prawns to pizzas, lamb, chicken schnitzel, and kangaroo. Although a bit pricey, but we agreed to come back for dinner. We arrived and were seated immediately outdoors, our preference, since there was apparently some big soccer game going on and it was quite noisy. Our waiter, Angelo eventually came over to bring menus and take drink orders. It was a bit of a wait before he got to our table so we decided we better order soon. As one other reviewed mentioned, they do tend to lose track of outdoor diners, so you have to keep and eye on them for better service.Drinks arrived, a Grey Goose martini (S$14) and a glass of Cabernet for me (S$11).Angelo had a bit of a problem understanding that what my husband wanted was really just Grey Goose straight up in a martini glass, with a twist of lemon. He ended up with a shot of vodka....(S$14, a bit steep for a shot of vodka) so Angelo brought him another shot, then tried to charge us another S$14. Something was lost in translation.For entrees we ordered the safe bet for my husband, Spaghetti Bolognaise (S$17) which is sauteed beef, usually hamburger, with carrots, celery, and onions, salt and pepper over pasta. I ordered what the menu refers to as the Antipasto plate (S$18) which was grilled Mediterranean vegetables, smoked salmon, sliced leg ham, green & Kalamata olives, marinated capsicum and semi sundried tomato. I'm fairly sure there was some pumpkin and eggplant in there as well, which was fine with me. I opted to eliminate the salmon and ham. It was VERY good, when it finally arrived, and there was plenty of it. Apparently there was another misunderstanding and Angelo didn't think I actually ordered it, so my husband was almost finished with his Bolognaise before my food arrived. Luckily for him they had more Cabernet so he could keep me company while I enjoyed my meal. After all the confusion, and the re-figuring of the bill regarding the second shot of vodka, the entire bill came to S$71 plus 10% service charge (be careful of these while in Singapore) and 7% GST - so about S$84. A bit on the pricey side, but hey, you're in Singapore, not a great exchange rate to the American dollar, and you're on vacation.Enjoy it

My partner and I have breakfast here regularly, and occasionally stop in for a drink or lunch. The food is consistently good, nice choices for breakfast and great menu for lunches or mains. Nicely prepared bar type meals at reasonable prices and good selection of wines/beers and drinks. Service is good but occasionally we've found ourselves having to work hard to gain the initial attention of waiters when seated outside so they need to work on that. There is an awful lot of seating at this bar with many screens for watching sporting events and enjoying a cold drink in the afternoons. Good atmosphere, will always go back for more
4
We had a sort of birthday celebration at the restaurant after reading excellent reviews. Although we book it just a day before, they gave us a table for 9 at 5.30pm. The service is excellent. The staff are friendly. We ordered the specialties of the day like the steaks the pasta and pizza, the sliders and others. They are all delicious and consumed quickly. The overall verdict is excellent. We recommend it heartily. Reservation is important
3
Had Fillet Mignon and it was Ok but nor brilliant. Good ambience in the bar with plenty of sport on the television. Good wine list and good choice of beers.
5
Quaint Aussie style restaurant, promoting the Australian theme
Primarily a clientele of thirty plus years, great food, great staff, and adjacent to the river
4
We love going to the Boomerang for breakfast on a weekend, and also for a drink while watching the footy on TV. The food is good, prices reasonable, and the staff are always friendly.
4
Go to place if you're looking to watch live sport in Singapore - plenty of screens, good attentive service. Things get a bit noisier later, but perfect for afternoon beers!
4
The restaurant is located in the Robertson Quay area, within walking distance from UE Square and Robertson Quay Hotel. Unfortunately, this location is best accessed via car or taxi.The restaurant doubles-up as a sports bar where several large screen LED TVs are installed and usually tuned to sports channels, especially during major sports events.The restaurant serves all-day breakfast on public holidays and weekends, otherwise breakfast is served till 11.30 am. Breakfast portions are generous. Ladies may choose to share one serving of breakfast (e.g. The Coolangatta). The coffee and latte they serve is done to perfection, by Australian standards. Those who crave for food other than breakfast are in luck. The restaurant serves great tasting food like chicken schnitzel, wagyu beef burger, steaks, etc. Various platters are available for sharing among diners/guests. The restaurant also provides a selection for children's menu.There is the choice of indoor air-conditioned seating or outdoor alfresco seating. Located beside the river, the location is windy on most days. Wall-mounted electric fans are switched on in any case.This is a restaurant with a casual setting. Many families with children frequent the place. While the adults catch-up over drinks and coffee, kids can help themselves to the surrounding area where they can run, scoot, skate-boarding, cycling, etc.Reservations would be wise for weekends and public holidays, also for dinner on any day.I will recommend this to friends who want to get-together for a good time, and families with children and pets. This is not a place to bring a first date or someone on a romantic date.Bon appetit

I guess if you are in Singapore and wanted to try kangaroo this would be the place - I didn't. I had the hamburger and fries which was fine. I was tired of rice by this point. This seemed a little over priced compared to other neighborhood restaurants in the neighborhood options but lots of Aussies on most nights
3
On our visit last year we went here 3 times in a week, each time through the week, which seems to make a difference, this time not only did they spell my nieces name incorrectly even after I heard her spell it 3 times to them on the phone and the reserved sign said 6 adults and 1 baby, yet the setting was set for 4 people?, and my favourite chicken wrap was no longer on the menu, my niece advised me it could be because it was the weekend, as she had had one a few days earlier through the week.The service was just bad, the staff had attitude by the bucket load, yes it was busy and people can be cranky in the heat, but even by Singapore standards the service was unfriendly.3 of us had the club sandwich, which none of us could finish, so the servings were not small, but I would have much preferred the Chicken Wrap and chips which was the perfect size serving for me for lunch. oh and ask for plain ketchup or you will get smokey ketchupI so wanted to brag about this place again, but I was let down.I will definitely visit through the week next year if we get back to Singapore
5
I had a BLT with a difference, it had chicken in it too and soda bread, it was served on a 15inch plate with a large portion of chips, my husband and I shared this dish before leaving Singapore. It was an open air restaurant and the staff were lovely
4
Visited on a Friday night to watch some Aussie sport and there are a good number of screens showing a lot of international sport. The beer is cold and reasonably (for Singapore) priced. I had a steak sandwich with chips and salad which was cooked just right. The bar can get a little crowded and noisy - but it is a sports bar full of Aussies. The toilets are very clean
3
Situated on the river bank away from Clarke Quay The Boomerang offers a good (claims to be Australian) menu. Certainly there is Kangaroo and Chicken parmy on offer.While we were three large tv's were showing 3 different sporting events and it was very noisy. The food was served relatively quickly and was a fair standard. 10% service and 7% GST added to Bill. This is not made clea
5
A good place for a hearty full English breakfast to set you up for the rest of the day. Staff are friendly and attentive so give it a try.
4
Bistro/ bar with outdoor seating and sports TV (sound off). Good food - typically Aussie Steak Sandwich, Wagyu beef burger, seafood, etc and beer/wines.
5
We ate in the boomerang bar several times on our visit to Singapore.
Good value for money and staff were very attentive.
Lots of choice on the menu
4
After having days of asian food this Australian bar and restaurant is a nice stop to eat something else. I had a burger with fries. Good quality, tasteful, just a decent lunch. And they have good coffee too.
Very friendly staff and good service.
4
Service is quick, lots of variety on the menu. The food is good and you can play a game on Tuesday night.
3
I was invited along for a quiet beer and a bite to eat early one Friday. Place was packed but the attentive staff quickly found us a place to sit. Pretty decent menu and well priced for Singapore. I had the chicken schnitzel which was enormous. Be careful though going on a Friday night. Very eclectic crowd - think of a mixture of aussie miners literally emerging out of an open cast iron ore pit, drunken rugby lads on their final stag, young families and the ubiquitous British expat broker type so commonly found in singapore (common being the operative word) - cashed up with a fake thailand rolex, red chinos, horsebit gucci wheels, shaven head and lots of tats. Would i go back - probably but definitely not the place to take your first date unless she too is an aussie miner looking for their first beer after a 7 day dry stin
4
Set away from the touristy area and situated in a more residential area along the Singapore River, this is a great spot to grab a beer and a meal. Open and airy setting perfect for drinks afterhours or sitting down with family (kids as well). Menu was Western/Aussie fare with local and other options as well. Food was good and prices mid-range. Nice selection of Aussie beers as well. There are happy hour deals to be had as well, came here while waiting for a table at a neighboring restaurant and was served in quick time. TVs abound as it also has a sports pub feel to it, but not as the driving force. It's a comfortable setting good for any occasion
5
Robertson Quay has a great choice of classy eateries and the Boomarang fits the bill for those looking for for some quality Aussie tucker at a reasonable price - by Singapore standards - and without the crowds and touts of Clarke Quay. We dined here for lunch and I ordered the steak sandwich. I'm not sure if it was Angus beef or Waygu, but it was the best beef sandwich that I've tasted. I like mine medium rare and it was just that, succulent and tender with fresh salad complemented with thick, perfectly cooked chips. Wine and beer were the normal Singapore prices; sell the BMW to pay the alcohol bill, however, we invested in a bucket of beer, six from memory and payed for five, with the sixth on the house; so we were very happy. A great spot to relax with friends; great food and atmosphere
5
Had lunch and breakfast at this bar. Definately it is a Sports bar, 3 huge flat screen tv's but a great atmosphere despite renovation wrk . Menu is very good and well priced, portions are huge, not for the faint hearted, but the hungry rugby player was well satisfied
1
I had previously been to Boomarang and found the food just about okay,if uninspired.The setting was nice,though over-looking the river on Robertson Quay.This time we went for quite late drinks after a concert.The setting has become much less attractive due to a construction site for a new hotel next door,not that it is Boomarang's fault,just a fact of life.What was shocking was the pricing.We had two glasses of wine each-mine a Merlot which was much too cold (if this was "room temperature" then it was a mighty cold room)-my partner had a Riesling which was okay but bland.We had asked for the house wine but it turned out these were not the house wines in fact.The bill for 4 ar best average glasses of wine came to S$84.74 which I think is outrageous.When I complained upon receiving the bill,the surly staff member who had served us denied saying these were the house wines and said,"No",there was no manager there to talk to about it.I advise to avoid this place like the plague,or if you go,to check each item ordered as you order it and as you receive it,something you might not be comfortable doing if,like me,you were out on a romantic date
4
Went for beer and pizza with the work bodies.
Very nice food was a bit empty, but very
nice.
Liked to location neer the river.
WIFI available.
3
Had late lunch, food was standard offering, cook managed to burn the bottom of the eggs? (pet dislike, service a bit lacklustre. asked for the fans to be put on, we got one put on which sent the breeze in the wrong direction! asked for another fan on other side of table to be put on and was told, the one running should be adequate! so we sat there sweating and uncomfortable throughout lunch.Not a particularly good experience especially after bill came along, overall expensive for offering
4
When I lived in Singapore used to go here a lot for sports but not great for Prem League as an Aussie sports bar. Large inside and outside area with plenty of screensFood used to be excellent but was just meeting friends for a drink. Menu has changed but food still looked good. Could not see the old Ashes breakfast and the like but maybe different menu separat
2
This bar serves good food and OK drinks, but is just too expensive for what it provides.Like some places in Singapore (admittedly not most), the prices on the menu are quoted as "++". This usually means that about a 10% service charge and 7% GST will be added to the menu price to get the price you will actually pay. However the "++" here goes a bit above and beyond the norm.Buying a pint of cider here at $17 results in a $20 charge, about what I would expect. However the lamb rump (a bit small for what I would expect, and a bit dry) at $35 gets actually charged at $55, which is somewhat more than +17%, in fact closer to +60%.Not only that but a "pint" is actually served as 500mL. Last time I checked, in Australia and most of the rest of the world a pint was 600mL. OK so in the USA a pint is 500mL but this is not an American bar, it tries to give the impression of being an Australian bar. So perhaps they should stick with Australian measurements?Lastly, if this is an Australian bar, would it actually kill them to serve some decent Australian beers? I didn't see any James Squires on the menu, the closest is a Coopers and you can get that almost anywhere. Pure Blonde and Boags are the only other Australian beers on the menu, everything else is Mexican or European and last time I checked Australia wasn't part of Europe. No chance of even a Tooheys.Good food, OK service, poor drinks, and value wise this place is a rip off
4
Stopped by here and had a good dinner - friendly service and fair prices although like anywhere in Singapore the alcohol is expensive so take advantage of the 'happy hour' to save a bit (although still $15.50 for a pint of beer). By the river so a nice place to sit. Sport on the screens if that's your thing
4
I visited the sister of the original of Boomarang on my last visit to Singapore. It is the perfect place to wait out a short rain shower with a good friend. A few beers and some snack food on the outdoors covered patio was a perfect to catch up with an old friend.
4
Been coming here for six years. Good honest food and good service. What's not to like! Our fave is the weekend breakfast sitting by the river reading the paper. Also like the Tuesday night quiz night. It's all good - food, ambience, service and consistent every time
3
I wanted to see a little of the India v Australia one day cricket match during lunch time. There was no option only Boomerang has the screens and the sound up loud and so close to the financial district It's my favourite place to watch sports
3
Visited this place on 2 Jan with my hubby to watch the EPL game & have dinner.Made a reservation before we went down.It's an australian bar so the tvs were also screening cricket. We were seated outdoors because we wanted to watch the game. On a humid night, outdoor seating can be a pain. The food was sub standard. We were told the devil's sauce ribs will be spicy but it turned out sweet!The other food item was not fantastic as well except the coconut shrimps which had very good flavor.The alcohol selection is pretty standard. Love the fact they served Pure Blonde - low carb version. Aussie bar, what you expect? :) The service level of the staff was not great. No smiles at all & had to wave a couple of times to get their attention! Wouldn't recommend this as a dinner place.Save the bucks for quality food. To watch a football game - yes.
4
We are regular visitors to the Robertson quay branch with the kids.The atmosphere is good, as is the food and by Singaporean standards the service is decent.I highly recommend the brunch options, both for the adults and kids. It's not the cheapest meal in town, but it's good value, and an excellent t place for the kids to play before and after while the adults eat, drink and make merry.All in all, there is a lot going for this place
3
Cold expensive beer But that's Singapore and all beer is expensive
Big choice along the river so just amble on
Singapore prices on an SA budget are harsh üôÉ
5
A group of 10 of us went for breakfast/brunch, all of us have a great meal. Service was great, cheerful and there was even 'eye candy' :) good location, easy to get to and price was reasonable :)
4
This is a great kids friendly bistro with a good selection of food. Perfect choice on the first night when everyone is jet lagged! Relaxed atmosphere and friendly service.
5
Best place for excellent breakfast/brunch menu. Good location by the river, very attentive staff. Worth a visit.
4
Food selection is good and prices are reasonable. Staff are attentive and friendly. Nice venue where you can sit indoors or out.
Bathroom facilities are clean.
4
Service the same as ever i.e could improve but fairly comparable to others by Singapore standards
Excellent food, some of the best desserts in Singapore
Suitable portion size and prices to match
Free still water offered and regularly topped up
4
Having arrived in Singapore after a 12 hour flight and unable to check into our room until 2pm (we arrived at 8am), we were incredibly grateful for Boomarang being near to our hotel. Loved the breakfast and healthy shakes which set our day off really well. It gets very busy at peak times so hard to get a table - first thing in the morning is very easy
4
Sometimes at the peak times it can be difficult to get a table, but there are plenty of tables & turnover is pretty quick. Try to book if there are a few of you.I personally enjoy going there at the weekend for breakfast, which never disappoints, but its a good place for a drink & a meal any time of the day/week
1
I had a delicious Thai lunch earlier so wanted something plain tonight but I didn't expect the most tasteless burger ever!It was called the wagyu burger and sounded really nice but honestly it was tasteless, it pains me to say it but I wish I'd gone to McDonald's!The fries were OK, service was quick, sports on the TVs screens but I won't be going back there I'm afraid.
4
I love this place yet everytime I make the mistake of ordering a starter and a main and the portion sizes are huge and great value but most of all it is great wholesome food. Fantastic location next to the river, much more relaxed that the touristy quays and just a good place to be
5
Portions are for sharing. The kangaroo steak was delicious! The staff are courteous and helpful. Even though it was the middle of the day, there were a lot of fans to keep the diners cool.
4
I had a quick bite to eat during lunch. It was very quite. No more then ten customers. The service staff although friendly was not paying attention. The sandwich was good and fresh.
3
This is really a sports bar, so great if you are looking to watch live sport with others for the ambiance. Food is generally pretty terrible so eat elsewhere and just have drinks.
4
Good western food, nice modern ambiance and reasonable lunch menu. They show all Rugby and Cricket the Australian teams are involved in. They also have breakfast from early in the morning.
4
We stopped here for breakfast. There weren't many places open at 7:30am on a Sunday. So that was the first win!With things like eggs benedict, bacon and eggs, porridge and decent coffee, this is a place for people missing food from home.I found some of the staff to be a bit abrupt and not friendly. Others were somewhat friendly.There was cricket on the TV which distracted the guys at the table for a while :
4
After 2 weeks in Thailand we were looking for something other than traditional Asian food when we arrived in Singapore. Boomarang has a great choice of beers and cocktails, plus big serves for their food dishes. We had the chicken parmigiana and it was huge, nearly covering the whole plate, and with a mass of fries underneath, plus lots of salad. Could not eat it all but the waitress said the bistro is owned by Aussies and they have said big serves are required because Aussies like big meals.Good music, nice staff. We enjoyed our time here
5
Its one of the best locations in Singapore. We cannot help but go there every week at least, maybe more. Its got facilities for solo nights out, business meetings, family functions and get togethers, killer coffee meet ups, Small family and friend dinners and brunches, and the romantic dinner can be done too etc. The Boomerang deluxe pizza is to die for. Kids can run around and ride bikes with you sit at your table. sports showing and they can close off area for small functions. Food is outstanding and has that great coastal lounge feel about it in the city. Right on the Singapore river so provides a respite for all the concrete around. Warwick Upto
5
I recently went to the Boomarang Bistro with a group of friends for their trivia night. Ordered several things to eat, all of them good ! Traditional pub food, pizza, wings etc. Beer was reasonable and cold, great atmosphere and trivia night is a blast 
4
Stopped in here recently with several coworkers for a trivia night. The host was great and we had an awesome time; highly recommended for that alone. The beer selection was decent enough for Singapore and the food was good, though not great. Definitely a fun place to stop in for a drink or for a trivia night. Just a tip: you typically have to flag down the staff if you need their attention
1
Dropped into this bar to watch one of the NRL finals. The place was packed as had AFL and NRL finals on so sat out on the footpath to watch the game.Didn't eat or actually enter the bar which was fine. My low rating is based on $15 for a stubby of Tiger. Now I know Singapore is expensive but this borders on highway robbery. Watched the game and left
5
TV screens showing sports events - live & recorded - with great brunch food, a fantastic family atmosphere and good service. What more does a person want?
5
Was out for the Grand Prix. Ate here and the food was great. Plenty of locals eating here also which is always a good sign. The ambience by the river is nice, and the food delicious.
3
We have been regulars for lunch at Boomerang for about a year but have finally given up. The portions have been shrinking and the prices have been going up and there are better options available around the corner. Management is generally unresponsive to our complaints.Good for watching sport on big screens, but there are other options for that as well.More expensive than most of the competition for similar or lower quality. Sitting down to eat meals on stools is terrible
4
I had been on the road 7 weeks and made it to Clarke Quay a day before Aussie NRL prelim finals weekend. I got a perfect table booking for the 2 games (Friday and Saturday) and watched the Broncs and Cowboys storm into the finals. The restaurant was all you needed for a sports bar - big screens everywhere, great crowd that new its football, really good food, quick friendly service delivered beers without getting between you and the screens and smiles everywhere - probably laughing at aussies going nuts over NRL and AFL on either side of the bar!Super night, super food and drinks and all thanks to the Boomerang guys and gals. Home away from Home - Super weekend aussie sports venue!Go the Broncs
4
Stumbled on this place by chance recently and was very pleasantly surprised!!! Typical sports bar but with a twist. Nice wine room providing a decent selection of good wines (many Australian of course) and a pretty decent menu too.I had the Pepper Roasted Kangaroo, while the pepper was a little overwhelming at first once you get past the outer coating of the pepper the meat underneath is really tasty, soft and delicious. My colleague has the Fillet and was suitably impressed. Quality of food and portion size = good value for money. Thumbs Up!!

I'm a sucker for sports bars and this one is worth a visit.A good number of big screens with (on the night I was there) Aussie rules football, 'real' football, baseball, and NFL; enough to suit most tastes.The food is typical sports bar fare (chicken strips/wings, hamburgers etc) but with good portions and well cooked.Give it a try
5
The food was great and the eggs out of the world. The fresh juices, omelettes and salad together made a really satiating Sunday brunch. The pancakes are also supposed to be superb and the ambience is lovely with large screens all over the place adding to the casual and fun feel!
4
For what I wanted, Boomerang did it. Wanted to watch two Australian sports finals at once, have a decent feed and be able to talk to mate. Singapore is expensive for beers, but if you drink in volume, Boomerang rewards you. TVs are plentiful, but not too loud. Will be back. Coopers is on the list
4
Our waitress Joy was an absolute delight, she kept an eye on our table and made sure we were well looked after. We almost went Starbucks because coffee can be hit and miss in SG but we were delighted with the quality of the coffee we got including one soy based coffee which can be a challenge to make appealing. The breakfast we ordered was good, came out quickly and the portions were very large, I ordered an extra side but didn't even get a chance to finish it because the breakfast stew was so big by itself.
2
I have eaten here over half a dozen times, and the food has usually been very good and affordable (for Singapore). However, I recently ate during late night when a reduced menu is offered. I ordered a chicken schnitzel burger which ruined my oppinion of their food. It was the dryest, hardest food shaped object I have ever been served.i would reccomend eating there during full menu service, but not late night
2
I had French toast and fresh apple juice for breakfast at Boomarang Boat Quay this morning.
This plain breakfast cost $25 which is ridiculously expensive.
3
Great atmosphere as a neutral watching NZ vs Aus rugby in a packed bar. Eye watering prices for a beer and food pretty expensive too, though of reasonable quality. Clearly very popular with lots of families there.
5
Having exotic meats, to me at least like Kangaroo and prawns as big as your head, Boomerang was a hit with me!
5
Went on saturday night to watch bledisloe cup and it was great night out with an amazing atmosphere. Would definitely go back again.
2
Unfortunately, the food I ordered was not cooked (actually very raw). So I asked to have it replaced. Next time around was incinerated so I sent it back and refused to pay.
2
Walked in and was almost as though you werent welcome. Staff behind the bar and on the floor were simply going through the motions. Reqested the Footy on and get a blank stare, I mean it is supposed to be an Aussie Bar and no AFL in sight. Order some drinks and food, food was ok nothing stand out. I asked waitress if they have Coopers Beers, yes we have she replies. All excited we decide to order the special of 4 stubbies for some ridiculously high typically Singaporean price. Open the first stubbie, now I drink this all the time and live less than 5km from the brewery where it is produced. Pale Ale is off - smells and tastes rooey. Open another stubbie to check and its the same, explain to the staff its off. They dont understand so they speak to the manager, we didnt drink anymore of them. Ordered different drinks, all is ok. Went to leave and get the bill and they had charged us for the 4 Coopers and yet we had probably consumed less than one, but opened 3. Complained about it and they off to see the manager again. They discounted it by one stubbie, very generous. If you're going to try an aussify things at least have an aussie or even english/irish bar tender that knows and understands

This was the last hurrah on a small reunion so we ended up with 10 for breakfast. Although the menu reads like a list of cliche's if you're Australian, the food is good and the setting was nice at that time of the day.. There was a selection to cater to everyone and the meals were a good size at for the most part at prices on par with what I'd pay at a cafe in Australia.. I can recommend the Boomarang Benedict (Eggs Benedict), although I will confess the Butter Brioche was a bit of a miss for me. I'm more of a sourdough fan.. But otherwise, everyone ate well and the coffee did the job
3
Nothing special here, if you need to watch the footie there are plenty of screens, food is ok. Caters for special events like the Bledisloe / World Cups etc where the atmosphere is good, crowded, but then expect to get gouged on the price of a beer.
3
Riverside location, plenty of Aussie orientated food which is decent, family friendly, big screens with sport on etc.It's a bit expensive though for what it is I thought and unless you are seeking somewhere western and child friendly for a drink in the evening it's probably best to sample other places and local foods in Singapore
2
I know Singapore is expensive particularly alcohol but to pay $112 for a few beers while watching the footy is hard to cop.My wife had a Mojito with virtually nil alcohol (30ml I was told) which including tax and service costs $23 for a small glass full of ice is a REAL RIPOFFMy other complaint is the size of the beers.A schooner is really a middy and a pint really a schooner. A schooner at $17 is a RIPOFFOn the positive side the TV coverage of the NRL was great (reason for visit) and the staff and location very nice.I guess I have a case of "sticker shock" but just warning others
5
Was there for the big game. Was a great atmosphere. Friendly, good drink specials, excellent location. Wagyu burgers were simply the best. Selection of beers was also very good. Would definitely return
4
An Aussie bar that shows a lot of Aussie sport. Everyone friendly, food pretty good. Situated on the river
3
we ate breakfast at the boomerang on 11/7/15, the eggs and toast were great, but tomatoes were not cooked and the spinach unseasoned. Therefore not eaten.
4
Great river location great sized meals in fact large especially chicken parmigiana huge great prices service reasonably quick lots of children around worth a look
3
went to grab late breakfast. I ordered 'the ash' as my friend recommended, and it was massive as expected. I believe they provide many options for satisfying breakfast. For nighttime, I wouldn't go since it's always packed by tourists.
3
A group of us chose to go here to watch State of Origin Three while in Singapore. Great atmosphere and location and needless to say going off with an army of Aussies watching the big game. Popular Aussie beers are on tap. While we did not have anything to eat, there was a constant procession of food coming out of the kitchen that looked appealing to me as far as pub food goes. Prices for drinks proved pretty hefty with one round of a pint of beer and two glasses of Sauvignon Blanc costing a staggering SGD 58.26, so you will need deep pockets
4
The place was hopping when decided to stop for a cold beer and lunch.We had a seafood platter which was OK for the 45sd and the bucket of 5 tiger beers for also 45 sd be aware that most prices in Singapore do not include taxes, they say++ as there 2 taxes adding 17.5%+ to your bill.Plenty of Aussie sports shown live, good location on the river, not a bad place to while away a few hours, worth a visit
2
We went here the other day for brunch and to catch up with some friends. The only positive things I can say about this place is the decor/setting, and the fresh apple juice with ginger which is a bit pricey but is refreshing on a hot tropical day. Unfortunately this is where my praise for this place ends. The food was less than impressive. The eggs florentine that I had were completely over-poached and the hollandaise sauce was totally bland and lacked proper seasoning and any sort of tangy flavor that you expect from a hollandaise sauce. It sat on a bed of raw baby spinach and a brioche roll that was pretty unimpressive. The potatoes with the dish were also quite bland and lacked seasoning. Upon informing the wait staff that the eggs were over-poached, they seemed completely uninterested and couldn't comprehend the fact that a properly poached egg should have a runny yolk, not something that is gelatinous like what I had. We also ordered the coconut prawns. They were also under-seasoned and you couldn't really taste much coconut flavor. The service here is woeful. Completely disjointed and chaotic and at times borderline unfriendly interspersed with moments of what seemed like genuine cluelessness. At one point mid-meal a member of the way staff came by and handed us menus without even saying a word, and walked away, leaving the empty plates that we just finished eating off of on the table. Upon paying the bill, I put my card down and got the attention of the server to take the bill away. They came back not long after taking it away and asked if I had checked my bill to make sure everything was ok, something that I found a bit strange...I wouldn't have handed over my card without checking the bill.I would consider the prices that you pay extremely high for the quality of food and service that you get here. A very disappointing experience all the way around. We don't ever see ourselves returning to this establishment
2
Food all bland. That's 4 out of 4 dishes. So way overpriced food for the quality / taste. Paid $32 for roast chicken and to be honest have had better chicken chop in hawker centre for $5. Did let staff know but ZERO response. Won't be back
3
Boomerang is Aussie restaurant and bar situated next to the Singapore River. We were recommended the place but can't say that we were impressed.Portion sizes are large but we all thought the food was only mediocre. Coffee was good. I thought it was pricey. We only has one course each, juices and coffee. The bill was over S$120. My sandwich as S$25. Will not got back just for the food
2
OMG!!We found hair on the their devils ribs, unfortunately no action has been taken to compensate us for the meal‚Ä¶one time visit
5
I ate here most days or night - hubby not a fan of 'foreign food'! Always had great food and the service was also faultless. Great to sit at the tall tables and watch the world go by or the sports on the big screens.
4
Walk along the river through Robertson Quay and Clark Quay to get there. Lively ambiance, open sides, sports on TVs. Packed on Sunday for brunch which was delicious. Dog-friendly.
1
We spend $865, which included food and drinks. Ordered 2 bucket of beers and they charged us 5 individual bottle - but for efficiency they brought the five bottles in the buck. The waiter is a financial genius!!
4
Nice cold beer and Australian food in a casual atmosphere. Large TV screens showing Rugby. Unluckily no Tiger Draft. On weekends already crowded at noon.
5
Went to the Robertson Quay bar to take in an NRL game. This place was great. The atmosphere was excellent, plenty of big screens showing the NRL, AFL and Rugby at once, service was great, drinks were okay priced by Singapore standards and the food was fantastic. My wife had a huge parmi and I had ribs, which in fact were cheap by Aussie standards. Couldn't fault the place on our visit
1
Seriously? You're a saturday night with at least three or four major competitions going on and you can't let us use half the space because "this area is not open after 9pm" while its just 2 meters away for the rest of the tables??Also the waiter would not give me back the credit card from the tab until I gave her the exact amount of cash in exchange ..... Seriously? None of us 7 will ever come back
3
It was set next to the river, nice ambience. Good place to watch any sports that's on. We went there for lunch and I ordered the usual breakfast with bacon, baked beans, sausage and eggs. I have asked for fried eggs and it came out scrambled, the sausage was somewhat tasteless and the coffee was diluted with water. Not really the best I have tasted from Australia. Service was attentive.
5
This is another local for my niece and we ended up going back 3 times in the days we were in Singapore.The service is very mixed, The female staff were unfriendly and need to take notice of how good the Trainee Homer was, each time we were there Homer would greet us with a smile and be very friendly and efficient, We ordered the chicken wrap, we all agreed this was very tasty and just enough for lunch, just be aware it is served with Smokey sauce, (you can ask for ketchup)by the second visit Homer asked me if we required the ketchup, that to me was good service to remember your previous patrons.The set up is brilliant with the open area with tables, bar and large T.V screens. I look forward to returning to Boomerang next year when we go back to Singapore
5
Have eaten here half a dozen times, and their steaks are really good. Sauces are a little lacking, but the meat more than makes up for it. Reasonable prices for Singapore - excrutiatingly expensive in a global perspective, but they have to fly the meat in from Aus/NZ so it's understandable
5
Having just spent a week in China it was great to be able to sit down to great service and food. The fresh salad was brilliant and the overall atmosphere of resturant enjoyable as was shown by the happy chatter of other patrons.
4
Found this little bar while visiting Singapore with friends. We had excellent meal drinks were good & watched the NRL. We enjoyed the atmosphere the good service & great food so we visited a couple of times were more than happy with everything
5
nice and clean, enjoyed the food a lot ! staff is friendly and do not forget about the Tiger Beer :)

I arrived at the restaurant at about 9:45 am to try and get a table for 2. The bar was packed downstairs. So I went upstairs to see if there was a free table. At least 50 percent of the bistro was empty upstairs. I requested a table but was told that the tables were reserved. I asked them what time is the reservation they were for 11 am. I wanted to have breakfast so I requested if I could be seated and served breakfast until the party arrived and I would vacate the table. The manager refused. I then proceeded to ask the manager if I could be put on a waiting list in case of a no show. Initially he refused but when I explained to him he started a list. I ended up going to another restaurant to have breakfast and returned at 10:55. The restaurant was still half empty. Just as the main bout started the manager gave us the table. He ultimately lost major revenue in food and beverage because we only ordered juice while the other tables only ordered coffees. The fight was over and then the crowd dispersed. The restaurant needs to learn to manage events better which was a surprise to me. Hopefully the manager learned something and will do a better job next tim

On the plus side, this place is open for breakfast. Places along Clarke Quay for breakfast are a little scarce. And in the spirit of full disclosure, I am an American. This place bills itself as an Australian themed restaurant. So, being (somewhat literally) worlds apart, perhaps I didn't appreciate (or understand) what I ordered. I went with the pancakes, fairly straight forward. They reminded me of American pancakes in shape only. Basically they were over sized lumps of bread (biscuits) rather than a breakfast style pancake. So, either this place had a total fail in the kitchen or I don't know what was meant by a pancake in Aussie vernacular. That aside, the service albeit a bit slow, was fine. The value paid for items received good. The ambiance is probably the strongest asset noticed from my visit
3
The service and the food here seems very inconsistent, when the service is good its great. And when the food is good its awesome. However, if you come on a bad service day then you really should find another place to sit same for the food.Their Kangaroo steak is really tasty and they serve nice cold beer and shows pretty much all the rugby and F1 that you would want to see. The place is nicely located right next to the river in a quiet part in top of Robertson Quay and is a good place to bring friends and family and even small kids

I was sorely disappointed by my lunch at their Boat Quay outlet last Friday. The only saving grace for my meal was the yummy fresh juice I had ‚Äì the restaurant offers patrons the option to customise their juice. I had the watermelon and pineapple juice with mint and ginger. It was truly as delicious as it sounds!Unfortunately the food and service was nowhere near the perfect of the juice. The food was really bland and not at all exciting. The portions are huge and definitely too much for one (unless you get the pizzas I guess). I had attempted to enquire about the portion size before ordering but was given no guidance by the wait staff. The service was overall appalling for a number of reasons,1. Took over 40min for our food to be served; this after I had to ask them 2-3 times to check on the order.2. It took even longer for my fresh juice to be served! Incredulously not only did it come after the food, I was already halfway done through it. As with the food I had to remind and ask for the jucie a good 5-6 times.3. One of the many waiters I had to speak with to chase for our food and drinks was dripping with sweat though I can‚Äôt be certain, it might have been water. Whatever it was it was absolutely unhygienic and off-putting to interact with someone dripping on the floor in a restaurant!4. I had asked for cold tap water even before placing my water but it was simply not served! Throughout the meal (and the long waits), I kept asking the numerous wait staff for water but to no avail. I basically left the restaurant without being served a drop of water.
4
There are two Boomerangs and they seem to be quite different. I went to the one in Circuar Road, behind Boat Quay a couple of times on my latest visit to Singapore. Thefood is just wonderful and the portions are huge! I went with friends on their quiz night on Thursday. The winning team get $150 off their bar bill, so it is worth a bash - and good fun too
2
I've had the pleasure of being one of the first patrons at Boomarang when it first opened, when the quality of food, service and ambience was brilliant.It's very sad to experience the decline through the years. It sadly has succumbed to the epidemic of appalling service that most of Singapore businesses suffer.Our last visit was for lunch just a few days ago. The service was so abysmal and shocking. In particular a waiter named April - huffed and puffed when we politely asked for a table for two -even though they were not busy, we have manners and thought better to ask. Geez, were we made sorry for bothering the girl while wiping down a table, she gave us look of disgust as if we asked her to lick our shoes! So we walked away and sat ourselves down instead.Luckily the food is still decent, the coffee is well made by a good barista. The location is excellent - open air and by the river and easily accessible by taxis. The price though doesn't reflect the size of the food. I ordered the Steak Sandwich and for the price of $25, I could get a better one from PS Caf√© where steak is better quality and the fries better prepared.Such as shame the waiters walk around with sullen faces, no smile - except from the assistant managers who are obviously from a different era of time where work ethics is still respected - the others reflect actions and create a mood like they're in forced-labour!I feel for the management, the great chef and the owner of this place that they must suffer bad reviews due to the negative attitudes of their waiters
4
As with all of Singapore its pricey, a pint of magners is $17++, so $20 by the time youve added tax.Beer buckets start from $45++ and go up depending on which beer you get. The food is good and relatively priced.If you are a brit and cant take a bit of banter, i suggest you watch sport elsewhere
4
Visited Boomarang for breakfast. Excellent, friendly service. Wonderful bacon and egg roll and milkshake. Very pricey but most things are in Singapore. Great atmosphere, plenty of TV's to keep up to date with sport etc and great location by the river.
4
We like this place for yummy pizza, healthy salads and fruit juices and pavlova. Sweet ending for heavy meal.
Good location by the riverside, very pleasant ambiance, always good service -- prompt & polite.
4
I went to Boomerang for a Sunday brunch and really liked the rustic setting. They have a fairly wide selection on the menu...I sampled their fish and chips, a chicken salad and a banana smoothie...everything was fresh and delicious!
5
We spent Australia Day in Singapore and were advised to try the BoomArang Bar and Grill. How pleasant an Atmosphere, there were Aussie's galore and natives of Singapore all together enjoying the celebrations. If ever in Singapore have a visit.
5
Visited Boomarang on a Sunday morning for breakfast. Excellent quick and friendly service. Wonderful bacon and egg roll and lovely smooth cappuccino. Pricey but so is everything in central Singapore! Great atmosphere and lovely location right by the river.
4
Nice riverside restaurant with many big screen TV's for watching Aussie sports. Frequented by ex-pats and locals it's solid food at great prices with efficient service. Happy Hour prices are reasonable.
5
We visited this Boomarang for brunch at the weekend and had the Ashes breakfast. It was excellent. Very big portion. Great pork sausage. Also included hash browns which is great as most breakfasts in Singapore do not have potatoes or hash browns. Great thick toasts with butter included.Great fast service!It was just too hot as the seats are outside.But We would definitely go again as excellent brunch. Very happy!! Did not have to wait for a table

As we were staying in the nearby Holiday Inn (Atrium), we decided not to take up the hotel breakfast and seek out local cafe restaurants. As it was out first day we were looking for somewhere that would give us a full cooked breakfast.BoomArang is situated on the river bank and only a short walk from our hotel. We enjoyed our breakfast and the atmosphere that this restaurant offers. As the name implies it is an Aussie style restaurant with sports theme showing a variety of sporting events on TV situated around the restaurant. Service and food were terrific although in keeping with Singapore very expensive. The prices don't include Service charge 10% + GST 7% so whatever your bill make sure you factor in the extra 17% or you will be surprised. For our table of 4, our breakfast came to $110. Coffee's aren't cheap here either as it cost $10 each after the service and tax was included. Apart from this it was great but couldn't afford to eat here too many times due to their costs. Their location is great so maybe this impacts on the pricing???The other plus is that they serve actual bacon and not turkey bacon like a lot of other restaurants.Apart from this I recommend it and would return
4
Good location, located on the river. Everytime I go there, the ambiance is good. The service is very good and the food is tasty. It can get pricey, but it is Singapore. Perfect place for a afterwork drinks and dinner.First time I had the steak, tasty and well cooked. Second time I had the grill platter, tasty and good
4
Eat here on both nights that we were in Singapore. Excellent choice on menu and the food we had was very good. My husband had the kangaroo steak and said it was one of the best steaks he's had. Good choice of drinks. Friendly staff and nice setting along the river. Not the cheapest but nothing is in Singapore
3
Can't go wrong here bar the service during peak hours. Classic options with an Oz twist.
Portion sizes are large and that should be taken into account when ordering. However restaurabt is situated in a good location to walk off the meal.
4
Have eaten here many times over the past few years.
The food continues to be excellent and good value for money
The service continues to be below par
5
Went about 4 years ago and decided we would go back with friends this trip to see what it was like. We weren't disappointed!Huge meals, great prices and a good selection of drinks, including cider! They even let us split bill. Love that I could watch sport on their tv's too. Staff always had a smile.Went for Dinner one night and were so impressed we went back for breakfast the following day and had the biggest pancakes we have ever had. They were thick and fluffy. Tea was great too.Would definitely recommend
3
We went here for lunch on a day we were short for time, and the restaurant pretty much does what it advertises. Lots of Western dishes available. The staff were not particularly engaged when we visited. The sandwiches we had were fine, but would go somewhere else if we had more time
3
Was here for breakfast with my wife. The spread is good with lots of Conti & Aussie options. The breakfast was tasty with freshly baked breads etc. The service is a bit slow compounded by the never smiling staff. The location is beautiful on the river. Nice for a lazy meal
4
I just happened to walk by this place in search of a decent breakfast and I wasn't disappointed. The boomerang Benedict was one of the best I've tasted in a long time. The service was decent to.It was just a quick visit but the atmosphere was pleasant with cricket and American football shown on the TV.I'll certainly come again
3
I always feel a bit embarrassed going to Boomarang. In Singapore, there are so many places with amazing food, that's local and interesting. But, if I'm honest, sometimes I just want a good breakfast or lunch or a steak. And Boomarang delivers decent food. Plus, location is great. Basically, my only gripe is with my self, hating to be the stupid white guy at a western restaurant in Singapore..
4
Really nice & funny place. All the days, normal breakfast and dinner restaurant, but if there is an Australian rugby match, the busiest place in the city. Normal food and price. I ve never thought but a really good Cappuccino, much better than a lot "italian" place
4
Boomarang is located on Robertson Quay, so first of all, you can enjoy the promenade alongside the river, chill-out with some friends and try to smoothly get rid of that chronically Sunday late morning hangover... well, indeed, you are in Singapore...The meal portions are quite big so one advice is : ok, you are starving, craving for both big fatty burgers and healthy greens, feeling like you could eat tons of them. But just stick to one single choice. Really, it's gonna be enough.Plus : it's tasty, yummy, and even the burgers can be considered healthy.Try to get a table on the outside part, with sofas, so you can even more comfortably enjoy your time there. It's pretty crowded on week-ends, and you will find all kinds of fauna : couples, groups of (slightly hangovered & wearing sunglasses even inside) friends (yes, we were those ones), families, local people as well as expatriates and tourists.Everything is quite expensive in Singapore, so we can consider Boomarang's prices are ok
3
Had the parma ham pizza(small) and lava cake with ice cream.Bill was 35$.Definitely expensive.You pay for the location.Pizza was excellent, nicely done thin crust pizza.Ham was in short supply but lots of parmesan cheese as promised, and the lava cake spot on.Always crowded on weekends .the sports on TV here seem to draw the crowd.Would i go back.Probably not
4
Went there for breakfast. Prompt service, good coffee, solid breakfast fare that met expectations, comfortable seating. Good, informal, location down near the river. Not expensive, but not cheap either.
2
We travelled many times to Singapore and know that the standards are high, but not for this gentleman who served us last night! Never saw a man working in a restaurant with such a bad mood and attitude but the food was ok!
5
Fantastic meal and service. Fillet mignon was perfect and on par with some of the best steak restaurants in Singapore. Will definitely return!!
5
This was a regular breakfast haunt for us. The quality and quantity was excellent and the service pleasant and attentive.
2
We saw this place on our first walk along the river, and made plans to have the Eggs Benedict breakfast one morning. However that night we decided to have our evening meal at Boomerang. The food was fine, I had cod on mash and Hubbie had the Kangaroo burger. However during the course of the evening we witnessed some very dodgy staff manoeuvres! We were seated just near the service counter. They fill water glasses from large cold metal jugs, we saw one young waitress throw the contents of a half drunk glass of water back into the fresh water jug, then stack the used glass on top of the clean glass stack. She was obviously too lazy to take just one glass to where all the trays of used glasses were being disposed of!Then to make matters worse, a handful of clean cutlery was dropped on the floor whilst being taken from the drawer. The two young waitresses just giggled together and placed the cutlery on the work surface. Moments later the same cutlery was picked up and plonked onto a clean plate before being taken to a table of eight, seating a family with children and a baby!!! We were horrified. There seemed to be no one around to supervise or manage staff, and we got the same impression as others who have left reviews.....they couldn't have cared less.Needless to say, we didn't go back for that breakfast!
5
First time for me and I will be back for more. OK you Aussies call it the Ashes but to me it was a 'Full English' and worth every penny. Creme del a creme when the HP sauce was presented! Seriously.....truly great breakfast and will be back to sample evening dishes. Good place for sports lovers with TV's everywhere showing live sport
4
Boomarang - so often I have gone back for your wonderful schnitzels and good service. Really, the schnitzels rock and this place should get a 5 star for that. They are large and juicy and I need to stop talking about it because I will drool on my computer.Lovely - she is really lovely, really pleasant girl who remembered us when we returned (but she did for everyone, great hire!).However, I did find that the service drops a little - less attentive staff and quite a few bad hires really. To top it all off - the owner just glares at you from afar - we came almost 3 days in a row, not once did he come up and say hello. I have friends that live in Singapore and they always go there and they have said the same thing - owner may not really be a people person as there is no acknowledgement or friendly walking around the tables to liven it up and spread the warmth. But I guess, gone are the days when that sort of behaviour is the norm. When owners actively seek feedback and seem that they 'care' about the experiences of their patrons. Yes, its crazy busy when there are games, trivia nights, but I'm talking about lunch time and breakfast time when the place is a bit more relaxed. I think my expectations a bit high, so although Im a bit disillusioned and feel that anyone else could take the spot of top Aussie bar/institution in Singapore I would go back again. Because schnitzel
4
This is a place for Aussies to hang around together, enjoy watching any sport on large tvs, have a few beers and wines, happy hour goes till 8:00pm, the wine is expensive! But they usually have a promotion. I got a glass of Sauvignon blanc for SG$18. We all ordered different meals, the burger was good, steak sandwich awesome, great crispy hot chips, the salads were big and my skewers were very tasty came with lots of sauces. This is an expensive restaurant, it has a laid back atmosphere overlooking the river so you can relax with your friends whilst watching the Grand final or any other big Aussie event. No need to book just tune up. It's in robertson quay, very central

BoomerangIt seems as if Boomerang would like to be known as a sports bar, and a number of reviewers have commented on the TVs everywhere. While it‚Äôs true that there are a lot of TVs over the bar and along one wall, the three times I‚Äôve been there over the past several days only two channels have been showing. Maybe that‚Äôs good for Singapore but when I think of a sports bar I think of one that has premium cable or satellite coverage like the one I went to in Key West on an NFL Sunday and they sat patrons so they could see the TV carrying the game of the team they were rooting for (that‚Äôs a lot of TVs and a lot of different TV channels). Boomerang did have the American football games (college and NFL) that were on Fox Sports and were on tape delay ‚Äì no surprise there. I was there at both lunch and dinner today and the same NFL game was on both times. I didn‚Äôt go for the games, however, so am only mentioning it as information for those who are. I stopped in for the food and on my first visit I had the small spiced lamb pizza (about 10‚Äù across) for S$18 and a mango smoothie for S$10. The smoothie was great and I‚Äôve had two more since then (both on a single day). While the pizza was well-prepared and properly baked, I didn‚Äôt find it all that flavorful. The lamb wasn‚Äôt spicy and I couldn‚Äôt taste the Kalamata olives. They do have a fairly extensive menu for a bar and on my initial visit I noticed they had kangaroo pizza, a kangaroo burger and a kangaroo steak. Never having had kangaroo, I decided to go back and either have the pizza or the burger. Given my disappointment with the spiced lamb pizza I elected the burger ‚Äì S$25. The server suggested it be cooked medium rare and since I was sitting outside and there wasn‚Äôt much light, I agreed. It appeared to be cooked medium and I don‚Äôt think it lost anything by being a little more well done. It was flavorful but I didn‚Äôt really care for the flavor as much as I do a good beef burger. I did eat the entire burger and don‚Äôt regret doing so though images of cute kangaroos did pop into my head a couple of times. The burger was served with a small tossed salad that didn‚Äôt seem to have any dressing and a generous portion of steak fries that were very good. All-in-all, if you‚Äôre in the area for several days this place deserves a visit unless you‚Äôre intent on just having Asian food ‚Äì none of that here. There are, not surprisingly, a lot of Aussies drinking beer in this place but who doesn‚Äôt like that? I found the service to be excellent on each visit and I liked that they served ice water to everyone who sits down. One final note, it‚Äôs trivia night around 8 pm on Tuesdays.Thanks for reading. If you‚Äôve found this review useful I‚Äôll appreciate a Yes vote below

Have a number of big screens and show the footy. During big games its standing room only - great vibe and full of aussies. They live streamed the Brownlow Medal count on the big screen - great work.Have the wagyu beef burger - one of the best meat paddies Ive had
5
Only been in Singapore for a few days to catch up with F1
And this is the best place by far to grab breakfast to keep you going throughout the day.
Yummy yummy in my tummy.

Great pub to if you want to watch any international sports. We went to watch the AFL, and luckily we booked as it was quite full. Meals were nice service was great .. A little pricey but no different to others in the area .
3
Super salad lunch on specials menu, which was both tasty and filling. However, went back for cake and ice cream and was disappointed both with service and with value for money. Good location, but many other bars and restaurants to compete with.
4
Obviously from the name it indicates Australian food & it has Australian food to a point. The best thing about this restaurant is that it had steamed veges, only carrot & broccoli but vegetables all the same (very hard to get veges in Singapore at restaurants). Breakfast was nice but expensive
3
Food was good - poached eggs, mushrooms, avocado on the side (Bondi), pan-fried meatloaf and Boomerang Benedict. Banana smoothy (S$10) was disappointing (watery) but fresh OJ was good. Coffee (long black) was terrible and we didn't drink it. Good atmosphere with outdoor seating on the river. Big screen TVs for sports. Dog friendly Breakfast for 3 was S$105
4
We love this restaurant. The atmosphere during the big games is great to be part of. I love going to Boomarang to watch Australian Rules Football. The lunch and dinner food is delicious. I tried the breakfast food yesterday for the first time and wasn't as happy with the quality of food for this as much as the lunch/dinner menu. Drink prices are reasonable for Singapore and the food is well priced. This continues to be a favourite for our family. I have tried the Boat Quay as well but much prefer the Robertson Quay venue

We have been in Vietnam for the last couple of weeks and had booked into the hotel next door. As our room wasn't ready we decided to wander across the road and check out the Boomerang Bistro & Bar. We had great service, and a really authentic Aussie pub meal, at around the same price we would pay back home. I'd even taken a pic of my Parma and it looked better than the pic that my niece sent me of her Parma that she was having in Geelong. We returned the next morning for breakfast with the same service. If your wanting a taste of Australia this bar/bistro is the place to be. I'll be going back.

Food - decent salad and kangaroo roast. Safe 3 and ok.Location - good location overlooking river.Price - higher than average for this level of food.Drinks - I saw 3 drafts. Heineken, Tiger and Strongbow.Would I return - yes. It was ok to have a quick bite to eat on way home. Wouldn't go for special occasion.Main feature - if you want it, loads of sport on large size TVs. Good therefore to watch sport whilst having a drink
5
I watched my first Aussie rugby match here, had my first VB, had my first kangaroo loin which is really great and had so much fun! Staffs are all very friendly especially Harley (he is very funny!) and the atmosphere of the whole bar is very relax and friendly! Definitely coming back and recommend to friends! 
4
Packed house last night for Australian State of Origin game. Despite this service was good and spicy lamb pizza was great. Beer buckets for S$55 (5 stubbies - choice of brand). Noisy as anything - television sound competing with enthusiastic crowd. Definitely a good sports bar for Australian sports nuts
3
Large restaurant, very busy so service seemed to suffer at times. The food was okay but not brilliant, but was good for a lunch with friends.
4
We ate here on a very hot afternoon and were pleased to rest up with a couple of great salads and some Tiger beers.
The salads (chicken and curry beef) were well prepared and the service was brilliant.
4
My visit was just so that I could watch AFL football. more than enough big screen TV's so that I could watch more than one game at the same time.
Good atmosphere, cold beer and good food.
3
Generous portions with moderate pricing. The food was good but I have to admit the service was a bit slow
4
plenty of screens to watch aussie sport. Pub menu is quite good too, we had the kangaroo spicy pizza, pretty good. Will go back to try more of the menu. Could have more variety of beers on tap, VB is soooo boring.
4
We stayed in The Miramar Hotel across the river opposite the Restaurant. A good start to the mornings with excellent breakfasts, plenty of choice and good value. Not forgetting the views of the river, The staff were friendly and professional. Good Wi Fi Connection.
3
This is a great all-round place, if you are not too fussed about your food. Quality is decent, but the real fun starts when some sports event (that Aussies love) is on. This place completely comes alive, and the staff knows how to manage the crew too
1
Booked a table for 6 to treat father in law for breakfast on fathers day. No issues when booking it but when arrived they had no table, waiters just stood looking at us as if we were stupid and all they were concerned about was getting us out of the way so people could watch the world cup. Had we been told that the whole place was going to be taken over by big TVs and loudspeakers we would have booked somewhere else right from the start. We ended up having to go elsewhere which put a real downer on the rest of the morning.
4
We visited this bar as it was near to our hotel and were looking for a close but nice venue. We got to the bar at about 9.30pm and it was buzzing. It was a nice mix of tourists and expats and had a good atmosphere.It was located on the river so a nice venue for leisurely drinks/dinner.The menu was quite expensive for the choices but we both order one of the pizzas and it was lovely
5
We went to the Boomerang twice for dinner and everything we tried was delicious. The portions are big and the food is really tasty. The house wine was also great and for happy hour the price for getting 2 glasses was really good. In general food is quite expensive in Singapore, even you just purchase some ingredients in the supermarket, so for us the prices at the Boomerang were quite justified and considering the nice location, helpful staff any yummy food, it was really worth the value. We definitely go there again, when we visit Singapore next time
4
I was staying next door at the Gallery Hotel, so as an Aussie I was naturally going to drop in on several occasions for a decent priced beer (for Singapore) and to watch the Ruby, League, cricket and AFL.
4
Been going there for years, reliably good. On weekends very relaxing to enjoy breakfast all day (seems the servings have gotten smaller though). Staff is friendly and after meal you can take a digestive walk along the river.
4
Nice friendly bar/restaurant could not quite bring myself to have the kangaroo burger but the steak was OK if a little expensive.
4
Brilliant sports bar, free wifi, good table service and the food is good. Spent almost a whole afternoon here, had lunch of green curry beef salad (nice), roast chicken (decent) and later we had the BBQ sharing platter (very good).Bucket of beer offers and Cloudy Bay for S$69, was good value we thought....for the world's most expensive city
4
Listen, if you are walking by Robertson Quay, and you stop in for a meal here ... you will walk out having had a tasty meal, at a pretty cool location, with decent service. Prices are pretty good. We had the calamari, which was amazing. My wife had the ribs, another amazing choice. I had the burger ... which tasted great, but was too small ... for an aussie place, I thought I'd be wow'ed by the burger. But listen, if that's the biggest problem ... then not so big a deal.One small note ... their happy hour was a tiny discount on beers. Again, won't stop me from coming again, but dont go there if you are after good drink discounts
3
I knew that Boomerang would be showing the cricket on the big screen. I ordered the $16 hot chicken wings (greasy), and the $8 bruschetta (fresh tomato on a soft focaccia-type bread) which would be far better on a firmer, even crunchy bread. The Tiger beer. ($12) on tap was good, and the service was attentive
4
I go here for BF and dinner at times and did not have a single disappointing experience.The menu offers plenty to choose from as well does the wine list and all at very acceptable pricing.The Thai salad with beef stands out.Very recommendable for an easy dinner night
1
Singapore is supposed to be food heaven, and so far all expectations have been met, great food everywhere, sometimes pricey sometimes cheap but always good.But last night at the Boomarang was a huge disappointment and clearly the exception to the Singapore rule, actually it was one of the worst food experiences I have had in years it was pricy, steak was tough and not done to order, sauce was water...and when mentioning our disappointment to the waiter comment was...‚Äùwill relay your message to the kitchen‚Äù‚Ä¶nothing else and waiter did not come back to our table..This is a rip off, price performance is terrible and like any tourist trap quantity goes before quality.. stay away

Ok, I better explain the title. It has long been a pet peeve of mine when people spend a fair amount of money to travel abroad and then sit in a pub with a theme of their home country. Eg. British people in British themed pubs watching England play soccer and generally doing exactly what they would do in their local, it begs the question, why travel abroad?To this end my husband and I try to eat and drink in 'authentic' places and try and avoid all Australian themed bars. In fact themed bars in general for fear of witnessing this phenomenon. We walked past this bar several times on our journeys up and down the river and finally decided to give it a try (mainly lured with the ice buckets containing pure blonds). I have to admit that we now visit this bar frequently when in Singapore. The slider burgers are fantastic, we had a main meal of lamb shank and prawn salad, both lovely, and there is a good selection of small snacks if you are just dropping in for a refreshment en route to another destination! I am disappointed that we spend so much time in an Australian bar abroad but at the same time when the food and service are as good and reliable as this it would be silly to avoid it just because of the theme! I would class this as our 'local' in Singapore. Its not really a fancy meal place, just a good pub to visit if you happen to be nearby
4
Quick pleasant service. Ribs and pizza delivered hot. Food tasty. Drinks served cold. Reasonable value for pricy Singapore. A thunderstorm had us wait an hour after paying the bill but staff were smiling as the rain pelted down. Many locals / expats so they also recognise the good attributes as above. Cooling fans and open air ambiance.Recommended
3
Sports bar.
A nice selection of draught and bottled beers. Had the kangaroo burger, which was nice, but a little dry. Served between two giant slices of bread for some strange reason. We had to remind the staff about the drink orders twice.
5
Return visits.
Visited for Breakfast on a Busy Saturday morning and a weekday lunch.
Good service at both, free tap water given automatically.
Calamari continues to be excellent but large enough for main meal.
Pavlova very good.
Fresh fruit juices are nice but pricey.
3
Good lamb pizza. Rest of dishes on the expensive side. Service amd atmosphere good
Aussies will love the stubbie holders for the beer! Too damned hot for pints that go warm before finished.
Worth a visit for families and a break from hawkers stands.
5
Boomerang down the quiet bustling Robertson quay area is an excellent bar and dining experience for the lads or families alike.The beer's reasonably priced for the area and a great selection, also good selection of wines.We had the steak an grilled lamb both excellent can't wait for next trip
4
I enjoyed a few beers and a juicy steak at the boomerang bar and bistro, yes it is a bit pricey but worth it in my opinion because they have the cricket showing.the staff where friendly so if you enjoy live sports and the boomerang is playing it then i suggest give it ag
4
There were 4 of us for a late lunch and we very much enjoyed it. The meals were huge and very tasty, I thought they were good value for money. The service was good and it had a nice atmosphere. I would definatly recommend this place for a bite to eat
3
Breezy, light and very relaxed, the Boomarang is an informal pub. Open and accessible, really good if you are looking for a beer and a feed, and not too fussed about the quality. Sports on every flatscreen, so the boys will be entertained. With $50 buckets of beer (5 bottles in a bucket), a party can be had reasonably affordably by Singapore standard
3
Wandered around Robertson Walk looking for a place to eat. Came across Boomerang which was packed with families with young children. As Aussie expats who have only been in Singapore for just over a year we were craving for good old Aussie food. Menu looked awesome, had a good variety of steak, lamb, fish and chips, salads, pizza etc. the other half ordered fish and chips which came out warmish n soggy. The fish itself (barramundi) was over cooked and tasted 'fishy'. The batter was thin with not much taste to it. The 9 year old had the pasta bolognese from the children's menu which was 'so-so', the mince beef in the sauce was tough. I ordered the devil's baby ribs which was so gamey/ porky that I only had 3 bites before I sent it back to the kitchen. Changed my dish to the boomerang delux pizza as I wasn't game enough to try the ribs again. Positives: the adults meal came with chips and salad. Service was attentive and friendly, the waiter apologised about the ribs. Pizza was good but by then the porky taste lingered in my mouth and I couldn't really enjoy it. And no, I wouldn't go there again as there are better restaurants in singapore with comparable prices
5
What a great find for us. Everyone so friendly and helpful. Food fantastic:-) Michelle was so nice and so was the rest of the staff.The view while eating and drinking u could not ask for more. Hope to returnIf you get the chance you must go
5
Sometimes you just need comfort food and this place ticks all the boxes nicely. We ducked in for an early dinner. The portion sizes were generous (ordered the bruschetta & two mains with one side and we couldn't finish it all). The menu featured bangers & mash, fish & chips, schnitzel, salads, burgers, all the traditional Aussie dishes. The service was excellent and the food was ready quickly. The waitstaff were friendly, top up your water glass and are attentive to detail. One of the most enjoyable meals I've had in Singapore
3
The food was crap and expensive, but the location was great for watching the All Blacks beat the Wallabies
4
I had lunch there, it was quickly served and good pub food.
I liked the fact it offers WiFi to customers.
1
We paid over $8 for a very average mug of coffee here. Over priced and average in a place that has plenty of options.
The sports bar is packed every night. Noisy ++.
4
Enjoyable, popular river front spot where you can hook up with friends, enjoy the sun, a beer, and good food. Casual, laid back popular place to stop in at.
4
Boomerang on the Quay, is a great place to meet friends . Food is good and ambience is typical of Singapore. The food menu will cater for all. Enjoy salad, or try kangeroo. Defo recommended . Lots of bars and restaurant to try along the quay.Enjoy Singapor
4
Calling this a "bistro" is nigh-on false advertising; it's a sports bar. But that's not a bad thing! Well located at Robertson Quay on the Singapore River, with a good party atmosphere generated as loads of punters all enjoyed the rugby, AFL and soccer on big screens all around. Surprisingly fast service and beer at decent prices (by Singapore standards, at least! $15 for a pint on tap, $50 for a bucket of five bottled beers is where the value is). Food is "high end finger food" - sliders, wedges etc - just the job while you're watching the footie and you wouldn't expect fine dining in a place like this. Can't imagine choosing it for a restful, romantic interlude but if you're looking for somewhere to go to watch the match (any match) then this would be a great pick

Unfortunately on this visit to Singapore, we were only there for one night as a stopover on the way to London. During previous visits to Singapore, we had passed by this venue but had not dined there, so on this occasion we decided to give it a try. It was a particularly wet Friday night so we dodged heavy downpours as we walked through Clarke Quay and on to Robertson Quay, where the Boomarang is located, with views across the Singapore River.When we arrived, we chose a table in the verandah area with a nice view down to the river. Our orders for food and drink were taken promptly and our drinks arrived soon after. When our main courses of a Hawaiian pizza for my wife and a chicken schnitzel burger for me arrived after only a short wait, the irony of our situation dawned on us. We were Australians passing through Asia on our way to Europe dining in an Australian style cafe in Singapore, consuming dishes that were neither Australian nor Asian in origin. We soon put those thoughts aside and got on with enjoying our food as it was now mid evening and we were both hungry. Both dishes were generous in proportions, well presented and tasty.In summary then, nice surroundings, good, prompt, courteous service and tasty food. Whilst not cheap, we did not think that the prices were unreasonable. Recommended as a place for a pleasant, casual meal

Enjoyed a lovely meal last night here. I had tempura prawns for starters. Lovely done, juicy and crispy. Followed by the kangeroo loin. I asked for no dairy and that's what I got. They changed the mash for crispy wedges and took away the sauce. Perfect for me. The rest of the party had lamb, chicken and more kangeroo. Everyone was happy and satisfied by the quality of the food. The drinks are expensive 20 dollars for a small white wine. Luckily I wasn't paying the bill. The service was very good and the atmosphere convivial. The only down side was we were sat for about 4 hours with friends enjoying this meal but after a while the hard wooden bench I was sitting on did become quite uncomfortable. But that's just because I m probably getting old! Probably. Good job no one can reply to this!!!!!! Ps it's wonderful eating by the river to. At night the place is lite up so beautifully
4
We stayed at a hotel next to the Boomerang Bistro & Bar and went here every morning for breakfast as the meals were wholesome, filling and good value. I loved the coffee and after 5 days sampled most of the breakfasts with each being highly enjoyable.I didn't make it to visit in the evening but hope to on my next visit as the ambience, friendly staff and location makes it an ideal place to enjoy a drink at the end of day. See you again soon
4
Great outdoor setting by the river with a comprehensive menu of Australian cuisine, you can sit outside and enjoy life pass you by. The boys can watch sport from several tv screens situated close to the bar. Prices are average for Singapore, main courses around SGD$30. Try and come here on a busy week-end as you really get to enjoy the vibe. Its fun, easy to meet other aussie expats
4
The Boomarang is a great place for a beer some pub food and TV sports covering most angles. If you are trying to find some Australian's or Kiwis this place is great - always a great collection fom people and a fun afternoon.
4
Very large and obviously popular with the local ex-pat community. The food is good, beer quite expensive, but atmosphere was good and staff very friendly, excellent position to while away a few hours people watching
3
one late sunday afternoon we had a few drinks and dinner here. The food was ok but the noise
with rugby showing on the tv was a bit over the top. The whole experience was a little overwhelming and definately not cheap
4
Not exactly close to an MRT station but we got there in the end. They don't miss you for drinks and Pizza...but then the irony is..they are "Sydney prices". $100 for 5 beers and a pizza. But! We specifically went there to watch the A League grand final where the atmosphere was awesome, we got a table and great service. Bar is cool and we had a good time. The place has multiple TV's everywhere so I'm sure whatever Aussie sport that interested you...would be on.
4
Robertson Quay is chock full of tourists, especially on the weekends, and there are a ton of restaurants with disappointing food options. Boomarang is one of the exceptions. The food is very good, we've eaten there three or four times, now. Never been disappointed, and it's a great place to watch the game. Service is ok, but service in Singapore, overall, is a little spotty, so what are you going to do?Suggest the Chicken schnitzel, wagyu beef sliders, Wings, and tomato Mozz salad
4
Great place to watch any sport, particularly AFL which is streamed live. They also have NRL, Major League Baseball and most other sports playing throughout the day. Service is fantastic, the staff are friendly and always on hand to refill your glass. The food is great too. Added bonus is free wi-fi so while watching the footy you can catch up on your emails from home as well. Plenty of Aussies frequent the place so great if you need a little taste of home
2
Staying at the nearby Gallery Hotel, I tried Boomarang for brekkie, lunch and dinner over a months stay. 13 dollar juices, extra 10 dollar charged when I asked for a few more cherry tomatoes to come with my hummus plate. It's outrageously overpriced even by Singapore standards. Owner overheard on several occasions being really rude to staff. Nice to be near water but that can be said for every bar/restaurant on Robertson Quay. Just across the way, Em bar does brekkie for half the price, and dinner. That said, service can be slow.Boomerang, not worth the sing dollahs it demands.
3
Great for a reasonably-priced drink in pleasant atmosphere; staff was very friendly & humorous! We enjoyed our first evening having just beverages ;-) Came back there a day later to eat but the food was a great disappointment. Onlyone out of four dishes was ok. Deviled ribs were just sweet and sticky, yuks (portion way too big), kangaroo loin was chewy and not seasoned (portion too small)...
3
Expensive beers, but decent atmosphere. Toilets seemed to out of action most of the time for cleaning! Not a board thing, but wondered on several occasions whether this was just lazy. Service okay and the Guinness was very drinkable. Did not eat in the place, so cannot comment on food. Liked the sport played on tv but being blokey with business colleagues this was okay. If I was with my wife, I would have not enjoyed. Too much! But that said, you get the atmosphere, good guinness and decent service. So overall a nice package
4
This is a great Aussie pub...excellent for casual breakfast ....outstanding for watching sport.Went last night with friends to watch rugby....large open space...not too noisy...excellent service...food is solid if slightly better than average 'pub grub'. Beers by bucket reasonable value...I had Kangaroo burger which was excellent. The biys share a platter which must have been good...it got devoured very quickly. Not cheap but frankly for Singapore fair value....I will defiantely return on my next trip
3
Food was average. Not great selection for wine by the glass. Service was average. Location was great, outdoor tables to just watch people walk on by.
2
Had a couple of burgers and a juice for $75. The burgers were nice but for what it was very overpriced. Would suggest shopping around.
4
Great selection of meals. The meals we ordered were big servings and delicious. Nice location on the river too. The price was a touch expensive but overall the service and experience were very good. Definitely heading back there soon.
4
Great food, location. Slightly overpriced perhaps but very good quality meals. Kangaroo loin and spring chicken were delicious
3
Christmas Day we had breakfast there. I tried the egg florentine .. disappointing . poached eggs not fresh and Hollandaise sauce is too little .
5
Beautiful alfresco dining area on the river front. Tried the kangaroo loin and it was beautiful. The deserts are pure sin. Service very attentive and quick.
4
on a friday morning, it was nice to have a delicious breakfast on the riverside. eggs benedict was well (though the dressing was a bit too much buttery) and the french toats were good. this is not a cheap place so be prepared to spend some more cash here
3
Located on the river with seating mostly out, it has a relaxed feel. We went there for a work lunch on a Monday and it was not busy. It is a large place so you can easily sit away from other people. The inside seating is still 'outside' in the sense the doors are open. Service was nice and attentive without being over-bearing. I look the stroller and parked it by the table with no problems. Tables aren't too close together at most tables that you are blocking the way.The chicken parmagiana was huge so for $22 (I think) it was a reasonable price. There was a generous helping of chips. The food isn't going to win any culinary awards any time soon but for an Australian restaurant it had the feel I was expecting - laid back, friendly, big portions and not too expensive
5
This is one place we feel going back for leisure.By the river with seating in and out, the place is full with families as well as couples.Enjoy a lazy brunch or any meal that matters, the food is amazing, and the service one of the finest in Singapore.its totally worth your time and money
3
Some of the menu is great some very disappointing, been back a couple of times but generally for a beer and to watch sport and catch up with friends. Pizza is good, salads not so, generally anything with chips is ok. The bill can add up quickly it's not the cheapest place to have a beer but okay if you are just watching a game
3
Slightly over priced. Serves Aussie meat. Very popular with mainly foreign tourists mainly Aussies and British. Very friendly staff and good service. We visited during lunch on a week day and found the restaurant not very crowded.
5
Great location on the river at Robertson Quay. Excellent quality food, especially the Wagyu Beef Burger, salads and fantastic breakfast options. Fantastic place to chill out, have a cold beer, watch some sport and have a great meal!!
4
This restaurant is situate along the banks of the river. I have passed it a few times and this evening I decided to try it. I was seated very quickly, there seemed to be quite a bit going on, big screens sports and a pub quiz. The atmosphere was quite friendly and service good.As name suggests an Australian flavor to the menu. I had Bruchetta to start followed by the Curry Beef Salad. IO had two Lime Juices and the total cost was S$49.43. It seemed slightly more expensive than some of the many restaurants around that area.Food quality was general good or though the bread(Ciabatta) was warm rather than toasted. You could not fault the generous quantities though. Curry Beef Salad was very nice and again a good amount.I would go back there, although it does get very busy on the weeken
4
aussie hangout especially during the football finals last month.seemed busy.could hear them from our hotel across the quay. we went for lunch on the sunday. still a sports bar but good easy food and as stated really cold beer. good view great fans for cooling you down. staff excellent for the smallish crowd of 50 + on the day. would i go back? ye
3
We liked how the place looked like, and it had ample seating area. Tables were far apart, so it made it easy to manage our 10-month old baby in a stroller. But the quality of food was disappointing. Fish did not seem fresh on that day, and the other meals seemed over priced for the average quality
5
We visited for breakfast which was amazing, we were bored of the buffet breakfast in out hotel and this was a welcome change.We were so impressed we returned for dinner the same evening. The calamari is amazing but a very large portion, too much for one for a starter in my opinion.The pizza was really good and as i was unable to finish it they were happy to pack the rest up for me to take away.would definately recommen
4
We ate here twice and although not cheap (where in Singapore is?) The food was very good quality and good portions, meals consumed between the four of us included Kangaroo, Bangers and Mash, Barramundi, Steak Sandwich. All cooked well, we sat outside and people watched and liked the restaurant
1
I have been dragged there several times by groups of friends to watch football. Having eaten a number of things on the menu, I can generally conclude that the kitchen is either playing a cruel joke, or are truly incapable of getting even simple item right.On top of that, the service is shocking and the drink prices are sky-high.Stay away
3
the bar is nice and aimed at Australians but be prepared to be fleeced. Very expensive for food and drink If you walk a little further along the river front you will get your drinks a lot cheaper. But I guess if you want to drink VB and watch footy then be willing to spend up big for the opportunit
1
This restaurant is very popular for sport's events, as there are a lot of TVs up in the restaurant. Very nice location by the water and great for sport fans to catch up for some good games and beers.However the reservation system is horrible. I tried to ring them for reservation but the phone goes to fax. Then I tried to email them, a lady called back for my reservation inquires. But all she said was our restaurant is going to be very noise, feels like she tried to ask me to go else where rather than dinning there.Then I told her, we are okay with the noise as long as there is an outdoor table for 6 persons available. She then confirmed the booking.An hour later, she called again and told me after she checked, there is only one small table and can only accommodate up to 2 persons. She didn't even apologies at the beginning and only apologies when I said her service was really unacceptable. Definitely need better training for their staff and the booking system
