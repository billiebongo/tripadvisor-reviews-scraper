Enjoy a meal of local cuisine in the historical SCC and be charmed by this restaurant's old world furnishing. On a sunny day, opt for tables on the veranda to take in the sights of the Padang and the Civic District.

You will find a good selection of local favourites (laksa, kway teow, chicken rice, etc) and international dishes (e.g. western style steaks etc). The Indian selection is also very good but only available after 6 pm. In the morning, they have a decent range of breakfast items (eggs done any style, muffins, all American breakfast, etc). However, it is a members' only club so if you are not a member you will need to be introduced by s member.

Situated inside Singapore's oldest members only club The Singapore Cricket Club, the restaurant commonly known as The Oval serves a great menu of local delights and Indian curry with an assortment of breads and beverages. The decor and atmosphere are distinctively frozen in time and emphatically nostalgic. Tale a table by the railing overlooking the Padang (old city hall square) now Singapore's fabulous National Gallery, and enjoy your thow-back in time alfresco style

The Oval & Verandah, popularly called The Oval, is one of the five dining areas in the Singapore cricket Club. In an otherwise formal club, right out of the days of the British Raj, The Oval permits its patrons to dress casually, which means that one need not wear a jacket and tie, or a full sleeved shirt. Flip-flops, singlets & tee-shirts are out, although Bermudas and open toe sandals are allowed. The more formal dining in the club's first floor restaurant The Padang, and the Main Lounge, do not permit such casualness.The restaurant is for the club's members and their guests only, and casual walk-in diners are not permitted.The ground floor room is large and airy, the french windows along the length of one side, open out on the veranda, which also has tables that overlook the club's lawn tennis grass courts, and the legendary cricket grounds from which the restaurant gets its name. The restaurant's walls have framed photographs of the Club in its earlier days, from a bygone era over 150 years ago, (the Club was established in 1852), showing what the place looked like when Singapore was a small British outpost in the far east.The Oval has an extensive Indian and Chinese Menu in addition to sandwiches and other snacks. They serve an array of drinks, including wines, which often are on promotion, and beer, including draught beer- both Tiger and Heineken. They also have delightful fresh juices, the most popular one being their carrot and apple juice. It has set Menus for week day Lunch, and a High Tea service every afternoon. We were there for an early dinner. I had their steak, medium to well done, while my dinner companions had a butter chicken- the original dish which the British later modified into a Chicken Tikka Masala- and a mock-mutton curry, which is a vegetarian curry, made to look and taste like mutton curry.Although the food is great, I recommend the restaurant for the experience of the old world which it still preserves so well
