Not many places serve Tamagoyaki made using a makiyakinabe (omelette pan).
Watch the chefs prepare the Tamagoyaki (real skills there!), and opt for your toppings.
Can be a complete meal with umami mushroom rice..

Around $11 for the tamago and unagi. Yummy egg and portion is large but price is not cheap for a snack that is not filling.

I love their shuu cream puff. I found the pastry to be crunchy and flaky. The filling is also very generous.

Enjoyed eating very authentic Japanese food.
Great flavour lunch I had the grilled eel that was amazing on the egg roll. My partner had the Teriyaki Chicken on Mushroom Rice. Enjoyable for a Mall quick eat.
