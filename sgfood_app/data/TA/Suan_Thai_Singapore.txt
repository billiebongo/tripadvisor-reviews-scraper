The food here keeps getting better. The vegetarian options help as my wife is Vegetarian and we could have the Mango Salad, Bean Curd Tofu salad, Phad Thai and my favourity the Lime and Chilli Cod Fish. They provide a seperate serving of hte Fish sauce if you need it. They have an offer for this combo with free dessert that is attractively priced. The food is authentic and delicious. Surprisingly it was not as crowded as normal and the service is great

I had been reading good reviews about this place and been meaning to try this for sometime now but only had a chance last week. I was extremely happy with the food and the service. We had the buffet and manage to try all the food. Our favourite is the tofu, stuffed chicken wings, rice cracker with coconut milk. The restaurant is small but was not crowded during our visit and service is fast and pleasant. This is a good choice for those looking for somewhere good to dine at Orchard Road and is cheaper compared to other choices. Will definitely be back agai

Strange smell inside. Enough to put you off eating. Staff are not pleasant. Food is sub-average. A lot of tourists here, very few locals. The restaurant is covered in awards congratulating them on either participating in a restaurant competition or not winning. I would advise against. I did not enjoy food and the food is sadly not worth mentioning.

We were staying very near to Suan Thai so dropped in for dinner one night. It is a nice quiet place with good service. We had Fish cakes, Pad Thai and Rice with Siamese curry. The food was delicious with authentic Thai taste and we enjoyed our meal.

This place looks to be renovated recently. It looks clean and cosy. We were here on a Thursday and the place was almost full. Owner and co workers are very friendly. Most of the dishes we chose we good -Thai fishcakes, red duck curry ( this is more of an acquired taste, not easily found in Singapore Thai eateries), Pomelo Salad ( on the sweet and spicy side), red and clear tom yum soup. call for reservations if you can. The place is rather smal

Went to the Killiney Road branch for a leisurely dinner, and got what we paid for. For the kind of place it is and the quality of food, it is a little bit on the pricey side (especially if you order any of the fish/seafood dishes). But the portions are big, and this is unpretentious, basic, can't-do-wrong Thai food

First things first- Food taste is good but still that is not enough for me to go back again. Loads of extra and hidden charges. Lazy and not interested staff. Worst part is the ambiance of the restaurant which needs to be changed badly.Outside seating is exactly next to big dustbins.Plates they give you are so old looking and run down. Still after all this they want to charge you so much.Better go to Thai Accent and enjoy good service and taste

Bought four deals via website, but found out the supposed deal price was the normal price for the buffet. Plus a fair number of items are just one time order only, plus one is forced to either choose free flow ice lemon tea or free flow calamansi at exorbitant prices, as they do not serve plain water. I feel any such conditions should be stated clearly in a deal, which is what many deals state very clearly. The place is very cramped, tables and chairs are very close, no privacy and increases noise level. The supposedly Thai food was below standards, and definitely not genuine thai flavour as reviewed by possibly suspect food reviews. Not recommended and will definitely not be back ever

First time eating here. My husband and I searched for good (proper) Thai food restaurant and decided to have our dinner here. I am Thai and I think I know Thai food more than foreigners. Previously,we were trying Thai food in many restaurants in Singapore. Suan Thai is the one that gave me a right taste and made me feel home again. Definitely come back again!
