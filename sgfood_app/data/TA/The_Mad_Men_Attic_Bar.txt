Such a waste of time and money.
Unfriendly staff.
Please go to other nice bars around.
Useless place!!

Went there on a Wednesday night and thankfully we had a reservation as the place is quite small and crowded. Food was not bad and the music is ok.
4
came here for a gathering for post dinner drinks. Shirlyn and the Unxpected are the live band here on wednesday nights, so another reason to be here, explaining the crowded open balcony seats in front of the band.
4
Went there with a bunch of friends. Located on a roof top with good view. Drinks are good and there is very good life music.

Was quite upset that they did not explain clearly what the items applicable for entertainer was for. It would be good to explain clearly so that customers will not make any wrong decisions.

monday nights here are pretty quiet, and you would most likely be able to get a table near the liveband. as such, the band plays rather light music, and the atmosphere rather chill, good time and place to bring a date

I was there on tues night and the live brand was great. i love that the live band starts relatively early like 8.30 pm instead of the usual 9.30 pm. The food was decent and typical bar food. Not sure if we didnt choose the favourite. we had truffle fries and salted egg prawn. love the place though as it is roof top and we get a view of the CBD area

We arrived at Mad Men before 830pm and there were only two tables occupied then. The waitress serving us could not answer our queries about happy hours and what time does the band start. When our friends arrived, they were serve by another waiter who told them that there was happy hour for Asahi beer until 9pm whereas those who arrived earlier were not even told about this promotion. When we asked the same waitress if they could turn on the aircon beside our table, all she replied was that the aircon was damaged. However, the aircon was miraculously fixed by 10pm when the crowd came in. This is very poor customer service by the restaurant /bar for not allowing customers who arrived early to the use of aircon within their premise. Although the Band was great for Sat night it started a tad too late, close to 11pm.

Have been here multiple times over the year. Besides the slight complaint that the prices of the drinks have been going up over the years, this is one of the few rooftop bars in boat quay with decent live band music. The food there is also quite decent as well

Surprisingly good music by the live band although the place is tiny so hard to get a table. The entrance is in an alley way so don't get lost! Needless to say, it is expensive for drinks... If you can grab a table here, the view and open air is pretty cool but sadly, it is way crowded and hard to move around on a Friday night so we left not long after arriving to go somewhere else

love the live band on friday! food is awesome - must try!. beer choices are quite limited, will be merrier to have more.

A little too warm and crowded. food is good and alcohol price is reasonable for the bottle service...
1
To say the staff here are bad would be an understatement. They are down right rude. Best to avoid this place and their pricey drinks as there are much better bars w views in Singapore.
4
Great live music, good fun atmosphere with a young professional crowd on weekdays, only downside is the wait to get service can be long especially on a Friday. But still, a good night out.
4
bit noisy,bit crowded, okay drink,close late ,enjoyed it.
live band was good, all in all good night ,
4
place is very popular with the CBD crowd and hipsters, packed full till you will most probably only get a standing space near the bar. some nice live band on a few nights. there might be better places to go to.
4
This is a really great venue in Singapore, great service, good views and a real relaxed atmosphere. The place does get busy but there is a lots a space. Enjoy the outside area with your beverage of choice. Enjoy.

Mad men's attic bar was a fantastic chill-out place after work. The bar offers a live outdoor band which was a great complement to the great view of the CBD area at night. Service was quick and the food was awesome.

It was going so well, nice spot, pretty packed, very local, not expaty, wines/beers were food mediocre, friendly enough service until it came to the bill. I had a discount card which gave me % off total bill. They argued that it didn’t cover existing promotions. Every other place in Singapore I have used the card have accepted that it’s off the total bill regardless. They have been the only ones to argue and argue we did for 30 minutes. Terrible customer service.They ended up giving us 6 drinks free which was more than the cost difference that they were arguing about….was it worth it lads? You annoyed me and my companions and we won’t be back and we’re happy to tell the discount card people too so that they knock you off their prestigious list. I won’t be back and if you have any discounts on your cards there beware they try and pull you in with them and then don’t give them to you

However the table and chair has limitation. Even though I have made a booking on outdoor but they places us seated away from the stage and it is not even a proper table. Hope there is some improvement in this as this is my first time going there for dining as literally quite upset of the servic

Experience the beautiful view when you have the outdoors seating, which is hard to get on weekends. Love the music on Friday, amazing live band performance! If only there's more variety on the food menu.

Came here for drinks recently. Rooftop bar is great: good views out over the city and friendly service. Can be a bit unpleasant if you happen to have smokers nearby though. Kronenberg Blanc on tap.
5
Use the entertainer app and saved on a food item. Love the spam fries and prawn paste chicken :D will revisit!

Drinks are interesting . Good place and good vibes . Will Recomend to others and will be coming back soon .

Great places to
Chill out .. However services was bad, staffs are not attentive ..
Food was good , reasonable price in cbd area
4
Really enjoyed the music and the roof top location was cool compared to pavement level. Good drinks choice. A little pricey but isn't all Singapore the same.
5
Love this place. We chose to sit outdoor and yet didn't feel warm as there are cooler fans outside! The live band is awesome and the food is good.
3
If you like Whisky and don't mind being outside (I don't ) then this is a decent place to go for a drink in the raffles place area. Give it a go as it has a nice vibe and band playing
4
It wasn't my first visit there, love the place as well as food. Service was good as well, great! A little negativity was there's only one toilet and the queue is always Long.
4
So, I finally found the place, and realised that I had been looking for it in the wrong spot (at least when I was last in Singapore), namely because I had expected it to be on street level when in fact (as the name implies) it is in the attic (or on the roof, however the case may be). Anyway, I discovered that you get there by an elevator that is unhelpfully located off a side alleyway (which means that unless you know about the place you are unlikely to find it). As for beers, they have a standard selection (as well as lots of other types of alcohol, but since I'm a beer drinker I only pay attention to beer), and the price is average to what you would expect from in Singapore. Still, it's a pretty cool bar and I'd probably come back

My girlfriends and I really enjoyed ourselves - fun loving crowd and fantastic live music! Everybody was dancing! Thank you for making my friend's hen's night memorable :)

good O' duo band that can sing and play good songs. nice decor.
can get really crowded over the weekend. good crowd, good music and a good hang-out.
5
Great vibe and the live band is awesome. Great collection of Japanese single malts. Cool crowd and an awesome vibe. Love the place. Must visit on a night out.

There were 3 girls, 2 Asians and a Caucasian, the largest handbag was held by one of the Asians yet just the Caucasians small bag was searched. Strange. We sat outside and all around us were chain smokers. It became stifling. Food was ok, service was slow, not a great experience. One not very pleasant toilet for all to shar

Loved how cosy it was, but let me just say right from the start -- THERE IS A LIFT!!! Accessed in the back of the building through a side alley..... so unless you are training for the vertical marathon, search out that lift. If not, then the 4 story climb to the top floor will really build a thirst for that first beer.Small menu of bar snacks, and although the mini burgers came recommended, we pigged out on two buckets of luncheon meat fries, truffle fries and har cheong chicken. Yums! The cocktails are decent, though not the best I've ever had; enjoyed the frozen mango margarita (needs to be more frozen, peeps), the sour plum shooters (yums) and the bloody mary (needs more tabasco!). Eyed the whiskies on the shelves but KIVed for next time. Great vibe, good bands. Good hand out for good friends and colleagues
5
Great place to chill with your friends after a hard day's work or just for drinks. good happy hour prices for drinks. the band on Thursday is beyond professional, thus would recommend to go there on Thursday. Come early if you wanna have a seat outside opposite the band

Really fantastic breakfast hot dog, which is cheesy sausage wrapped around with bacon and slapped on with generous serving of scrambled eggs. Had spam fried, truffle fries, ha cheong (prawn paste) fried chicken and marmite fried pork. Only one waitress was helpful and quick with orders. All the other male waiters just stood around and totally unhelpful. I asked for extra forks and he just pointed me to get myself at a corner but lower drawer in a tray. What kind of service is this?

Ok, looking at all the reviews on here about Mad Men. You get what you pay for. If you want a night that is different and great music ( Sandz & Gideon ) a must to see, this is the place for you. I have never met anyone that was rude, if anything the service was what you would expect from a small venue that is busy. I was always getting people come up to me shaking hands and just enjoying the night. If on the other hand you have an 18 month old baby or don't like small places, there are lots more places to g

This funky, must-see roof-top bar is part of a classic shophouse, which just adds to the charm. Conveniently located in North Canal Road, it’s ideal for an after-work cocktail or for a nice night out with friends. Between the excellent view of the city skyline, the live music every night, and the tempting tasting bites and cocktails (excellent selection of gin and whiskies!), and the dangerously tempting Mad Sour Plum shots, we were hooked! On another recent night visit, we particularly enjoyed the Mini-Burgers paired with a Ginger Mojito and a Dry Martini… not to mention the nice crowd

It's a great little bar that you get to by a rickety lift. It is snug and there is space outside on the "roof" where you get a great view of the south side. It can get cramped there and the space is also taken up by the band which comes on after 8.30. This makes it impossible to talk, you don't go for the riveting conversation right? Anyway, drinks and food are standard fare at standard Sing prices and they do wine too. So, so far we have a great location, with a great band and a great atmosphere and what is wrong? The staff. Soooooooo bad it's not funny. Seriously, if they sorted that out this would be a fantastic joint that would make you feel wanted. At the moment you get the feeling that it is your privilege to be drinking in THEIR bar. Shocking
