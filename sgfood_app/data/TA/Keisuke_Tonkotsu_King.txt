We stopped into Keisuke for a quick dinner a couple of weeks ago. I’m still thinking about how delicious the ramen was. It had a thick flavourful broth and excellent noodles. There was a bit of a wait, but it wasn’t too bad.
5
Always good and cheap, a must visit when you want your ramen. Winter ramen is my favorite, try the green tea cola too
5
For a small price u can get the best ramen in Singapore!
Better to go in off-peak time because the queue can be quite long!
5
visited three times since its opening. Broth was excellent with free flow sides. Love the spicy ramen soup that is ricah in stock with the perfect ajitama to go with! Spaces is limited so either go early or much later.
5
We had been having dinner here at almost weekly basis. Sometimes the queue is real long but the standard of ramen is always there. Totally in love with Keisuke Ramen!!

Heard many great reviews about this place, and how it's the place to be to get your ramen fix. Unfortunately this place was even compared to Ichiran's standards, and what a horrible comparison it was!For a bowl of $12.90 ramen, you're better off spending your money elsewhere.Broth was not rich, ramen noodles were extremely hard. The only good thing about this place is the free flow of hard boiled eggs, beansprouts and barley green tea. Other than that, this place is not worth your time and money

I am not a specialist in Ramen and just followed the simple process of ordering. You are given a paper when you are waiting outside (third night in a row that i pass here and is full), and i chosen the black ramen with all toppings. In the rest i was defensive, normal broth flavour, normal noodles, less chicken oil. Once you enter the service is quick (i handed the paper still outside), and there is free hard boiled eggs and bean sprout. When the Ramen arrived i started slowly getting used to the tastes and textures (mainly of the broth and egg), but it became more and more satisfying. Half way i was already at ease and just enjoying the great flavours. Efficient and friendly service. Totally recommended

Cravings fully satisfied. You won't be disappointed here. The picture featured here is the Tonkotsu King Special Ramen which comes with seaweed, flavoured onsen egg and extra chashu at $14.90. Hard boiled eggs, sesame and bean sprouts are complimentary and free flow! You practically much decide how you want your Ramen to be cooked. You can choose the taste of the soup (light, normal or strong), the amount of chicken oil used (none, less, normal or more) and texture of noodle (hard, normal or soft). The basic Tonkotsu King Ramen is at $9.90. My only complaint of this place is air conditioning is poor!

Do expect to queue around 20 mins to get in.They provide barley tea to keep u occupied while waiting.Area might've wet if it is raining and if there is along queue.Quite a few choices for customization1) soup base - I choose black2) hardness of noodle - I chose hard3) combo - I chose more meat, lava egg and seaweedThe lava egg was molten which was good.The noodle was hard and it tasted nice.Rare that ramen came with black fungus, slight crunch. Soup was flavorful with pork base. Definitely one of the better around. I considered this better than ippudo. Free flow of bean sprout and hard boiled egg, nth really spectacular in that aspect.Place was slightly cram due to the small stall, but not that squeezy. Air con was good and staff service was good also.The green tea coke was refreshing to try!!!Please try if got stock!Definitely worth it to come again... but definitely good introduction to the family, probably try tori ramen keisuke next time too

I'm a big fan of this place. I've been several times on my visits to Singapore. The queue varies based on when you go. But once inside it's quick service. I believe their whole goal is quick turnover. But the pork is great in the ramen. I also life the extra eggs and sprouts on the table side. Bottom line, will continue to come back and will recommend.

Best ramen in Singapore!! Soup very tasty and very porky. You may choose your own preference for noodle texture, soup, oil, etc. Different branches have their own speciality for soup base. Don't go the wrong branch if you want the pork base.
3
A small store at the side of orchid hotel. You can get free vegetables (beans sprouts) and eggs. For preference, I did not like the soup as it wasn't that flavourful. The soup base didn't give me that pack of punch when I had my first sip. Overall its a good ramen.and affortable ramen.
4
This review is for their branch at Paya Lebar Square. The soup is tasty and I had the black spicy version, which is peppery. There is also a non-spicy and red spicy version. Overall, the restaurant is one of the better ramen places in Singapore. They do not accept credit cards so remember to bring cash
5
No wonder there is always a line. This place offers delicious ramen. best I 've ever had in my live (and I have tried many places in Japan...). A bowls of Ramen per $11.5 (less than 6 pounds) and a beer for $7.5 (less than 4 pounds). Heaven on earth for just under 10 pounds... If you are in SG, go! Go now!!
5
This is definitely one of my favourite restaurant in Singapore. I have not tried the authentic ramen in Japan but this definitely tastes fantastic. Their flavoured egg is a must try. They have free flow hard boiled eggs and also bean sprouts to go along with your noodles.
5
We went with friends who swore by the authenticity of the ramen at this place (confirmed by friends of theirs who lived in Tokyo). It is excellent. You place our order while queueing outside and are served rather swiftly after being seated. Service is attentive. This place is clearly popular and it is obvious why. We'll definitely be queuing again soon
5
They served generous amount of toppings, especially the eggs! The ramen itself is delicious. If you come during lunch or after office hour, the place will be packed and be prepared to wait. While waiting, you can fill out your preference of ramen, broth, toppings, etc

The customers of this shop are mainly youth below 25 years. Presumable for the good value it offers. For $14.80 you get a deliciously big bowl of Ramen (Japanese noodle) in thick pork bone soup, top with 3 large slices of pork, a well marinated onsen egg, giant size seaweed and black fungus. Amazingly there are also free and unlimited supply of black sesame seed (that you could grind it yourself), spicy bean sprouts, hard boil eggs and of course water (unlike most stalls that charge 80 cents for tap water!). Such a great taste, good value and warm sense of hospitality. Besides that you could also choose the intensity of the soup, hardness of the noodle and the amount of chicken oil. You might have to queue for about 10 minutes, but it is definitely worth it
5
Authentic ramen restaurant. Be prepared to wait to get a seat in this small 25-seater casual eating place, which in my view is some of the best value in town. Around S$ 60 for three persons with soft drinks. While waiting you fill in your order and you may choose your preferred noodle texture, and order the 'light' taste of soup, if you prefer less salty. Ingredients and portions are very generous. Highly Recommended
4
Fill out your preference in the sheet of paper. Good to be able to select the saltiness/thickness of the broth and the texture of noodles. Do try the green tea coke as its something different. Love the fact that they give u a bowl of hard boiled eggs FOC and even the japanese mayo to dress it with, hungry people fret not while waiting! They have a new outlet at Paya Lebar (cramped space) and another at Parkway Parade (side entrance left corner)

3rd time in the year and the broth is still as tasty and rich as always (although some oil coagulated in my soup). Ramen noodles are nice and springy with a good chew.Self service hard boiled eggs, taugeh and water too makes this place a good solo treat.If you are solo and don't mind squeezing next to random strangers, it should be possible to get a seat relatively quick.Got in at 645pm before the queue turned monstrous by 7pm.Paid 15 all in for a basic ramen (no extras) with a ice tea. Enjoy
4
2nd visit to this place: this time for lunch on a Monday. Ramen quality is decent with a choice of options for sauce and texture. Eggs and pickled bean sprouts available at the tables. Usually very popular at lunchtime but no wait for us today at around 12pm
5
I'm not kidding you when I say that this is the best ramen you can get in Singapore, and mind you, i'm a local. It's a humble, cosy and small ramen place, served by Japanese chefs. The place offers you free iced tea while waiting for your turn and gives you a checklist to customise the taste according to your preference. The extra plus point of this ramen place would be the free flow of eggs and bean sprouts (yes, you heard me!!!). It's just normal hard-boiled eggs and not specially flavoured Japanese eggs though. I would always add the Japanese Mayonaise sauce on my hard-boiled eggs and it tastes delicious :) Do please be prepared to wait. If you are here during peak period, it'll at least be about 45 mins and at least about 20 mins during off-peak period. You'll be asked politely to leave if you've finished your meal long enough and there is a massive queue so please try to finish your food and not delay the queue
5
I can't emphasize enough how good this place is. They give you a checklist on what you want in your food and they'll cook it for you. Then you get your delicious and uber tasty ramen. One bowl is more than enough to fill you up. You can also eat boiled eggs for free (I think). Anyone should try it. It's a small place and could easily be missed in busy Tanjong Pagar. Tasty food and decent prices. I'm glad my boyfriend took me there! Highly recommended!

This ground floor eatery is located at the corner of a commercial building facing the main road and hawker centre. The bar top style eatery offers a flexible menu which comes with gyoza of your choice, a choice of 2 sides and soup with rice. Pickles and other condiments were included except drinks. I was impressed because the gyoza and dishes were made in house. Total bill inclusive of GST and taxes was almost $60 for the 3 of us. It was not super cheap but lip smacking good.Service was prompt and efficient and if you do not mind eating with others, it is a great place to soak in the vibe of the office workers in the area

Tried ramen at Keisuke Tonkatsu at Bugis. The ramen itself is customizable - we can determine how 'strong' the flavoring, etc. Be warned - Strong is very salty. The waiter/waitress there would give you the same warning and they are not kidding. If you like your food salty - go for strong. Personally, the best taste would be between normal and strong.Avoid their 'recommended' green tea cola ~ taste just like plain Coke. Nothing special and definitely not worth it.This place would be one of those - try once and possibly forget unless you're a huge ramen fan
4
I'm not a ramen expert but had heard good reviews and was in the area anyways at lunchtime. Surprisingly there was no line up so I did not get to try their free barley tea (and fan) for those waiting outside. There is an awning and chairs so the wait would not be unbearable. I got a seat at the "bar" where you check off what you want. The waiter was efficient and got us our water glasses and picked up orders promptly. The ramen also arrived within about 5 minutes. I got the regular with everything. The egg was lovely and had a nice soy flavouring the egg white with a perfectly soft cooked sweet yolk. I didn't try the free boiled eggs on the table (these would not be flavoured I understand). I did however put the pickled bean sprouts, sesame seeds and some shichimi into my broth (after tasting it first). I didn't find the broth overly salty. The pork was thin slices and alright. The noodles were al dente and overall, I enjoyed it. The surprise is in payment. Even though I ordered the basic $10.40 base with the $4 topping and GST/service charge, lunch came to a whopping $17.50. I know Singapore is expensive but I thought this was pricey for noodle soup. This restaurant is a tight squeeze and while some people looked like they were here with friends for lunch, it's so small and service so quick, I don't recommend it as anything except a quick spot to eat
4
Tanjong pagar is shaping up to be a place for great ramen. Keisuke is small and always has a long queue. Its ramen comes in a rich, pork broth and free flow of boiled eggs (you have to pay if you want their soy braised eggs). Go in, eat and leave; the place is too small for chit chat anyway and be nice to the people in line outside
4
I love a rich, high-sodium broth and the hearty ramen here fits the bill. I have been here a few times. Took a friend here once and he agreed it's good. Every time I am in Tanjong Pagar, I will always think of dropping in.I always order the seaweed ramen, but I think next time I will just take the basic option, cos I have a habit of throwing in the bonito powder and seasoned bean sprouts and chilli powder. The broth becomes even richer. For the record, the seaweed option is good.My personal style is to first take the soup as it is. Then add bean sprouts and enjoy the soup as I munch and crunch. Then add bonito powder and savour the fishy taste. Then add lots of chilli powder to blunt the sodium a little. I usually take a white hard-boiled egg too and I recently learned a new trick. For girls who do not want to engage in maniacal table-top egg-bashing on a first date, daintily hit two eggs together. Only one will crack :)Personally, I think this place is better for solo diners cos the place is so cramped that you won't want to linger over drinks. In fact, the place feels very utilitarian. Staff are very efficient but not very friendly, perhaps because the hungry hordes can get a bit overwhelming.This is affordable comfort food for those who do not care for ambience and comfort. Just go in, attack and leave. Enjoy..

We have passed by the place a couple of times and there were always a long queue of people waiting to get in. We decided to try the place as the queue was shorter today, but the wait was still long. We found the table to be rather small for 2 persons, and certainly uncomfortable to eat with the limited space. The food was ok, although the hardboiled eggs and beansprouts were free.
5
Stayed at the Orchid Hotel and this small restaurant is located right at the corner of the hotel building.Went there at 11.15 to be first in queue before the 11.30 opening.Reasonably priced at $17.50 for all toppings. I must say the broth is not the usual "sickening" thick heavy broth I find in most of the popular ramen joints, Somehow it is just right. Choice of noodles soft, medium or hard, soup base and toppings.Overall this is my favorite ramen place in Singapore. Definitely will be back. Just arrive early as the very limited seats means waiting outside for your turn
5
After the first try, it got me back for more. The price is reasonable and service is good too. The flexibility to choose the hardness of the ramen and the thickness of the broth is good what more, free flow of hard boil eggs and bean sprout.

If you have cravings for ramen, this is the place to go. Located just few meters away from Tanjong Pagar station, exit A, this ramen shop only offers three types of pork-based ramen. The good thing is that you can choose the amount of oil, the texture of your noodles and the thickness of your broth. I always order low oil, hard noodles and light base broth with all toppings (egg, japanese mushrooms and seaweed) and it's delicious. Also, you can grind sesame seeds to add to the ramen and increase the flavor intensity.Bean sprouts, boiled eggs and bonito flakes are complementary and you can get as much as you want too. Japanese mayonnaise is also available for your boiled eggs.Lines are usually long, as the place only have few chairs and tables. The best is to come by yourself or a very small party. If this is the case, you will probably wait 15 to 20 minutes at peak times. Otherwise you and your friends might have to wait for long. However, I have to say the waiting time is worth!
4
Your hot steaming bowl of noodles comes with a tasty bean sprouts & boiled eggs on the side. Go with the less oil and less salt version if you're on a diet. Quick, tasty & fuss free. Was 1st in queue on the weekend and didn't have to wait although the fast moving queue started to form behind us pretty quickly
4
The shop is small, only cater about 25 person if full house. But don't worry, the service is super fast.No menu with picture provided, only 3 options (normal tonkotsu, spicy, and black). I tried the black which is nice. The other option to bring the ramen closer to your taste, you are free to choose how the ramen is cooked (soft, normal, or hard) and the soup itself (soft, normal, or strong taste).Try the normal if you don't like too salty.Free boiled egg and beansprout is on your table, grab as many as u like. Free barley tea while queuing, and of course free plain tap water.Extra topping seaweed, flavoured egg, etc at additional cost.Recomended drink: green tea cola and another type wasabi mix with??(err..can't remember).Price around $13-16+
4
if u visit here during lunch time or after office, i tell you the queue is absurd.. try to visit besides that busy hours.. the taste is delicious, but I heard there is another ramen that taste better. Anyway, this worth to eat, but a bit pricey than foodcourt price
4
We waited about 15mins to be seated at lunch time. In the queue we were given slips of paper to place our individual orders. I was surprised at the options available, including the consistency of the noodles (hard, normal or soft) and the amount of oil to be added (none, less, normal or more). It's almost like you get to custom order. Because our orders were already placed while waiting in the queue, our food was served fairly quickly once we were seated. Even though my noodles looked like it was swimming in oil (note : I had chosen the red spicy with less oil) the soup was still very delicious and didn't give me the yucky, queasy feeling. It's understandable why there was still a queue even when we finished and left
5
A very no-frills authentic ramen place. It's a cramped seating area and the queues will be long if you don't know when to come. I'd recommend a late lunch (2pm+) or early dinner (be the first in line! 6pm)The ramen is fantastic. Broth is smooth and flavourful, noodles are cooked to my liking (you can decide, "hard" "normal" or "soft". and I always leave clutching my tummy because I am SO FULL.The service is the bare necessary. You cannot possibly be ignored by them since it's literally five steps from end to end of the restaurant. But I absolutely love it because it's authentic and so full of character :DMy go-to ramen place. At least once a month
5
They only serve 3 kind of ramen: normal tonkotsu ($10.80), black (pepper, $11.80) and red (spicy, $11.80). You can choose for thick or thin broth, soft or hard noodle, no or much oil. You could also top up for a seaweed, flavored egg, or others for $1-2.We chose without extras as you could add beansprouts, eggs and sesame seeds as you want.The noodle and broth were very delicious, maybe the best ramen I had in Singapore (we eat ramen regularly).The place is quite small, so prepare to line up, or come early when they open at 6pm for dinner
5
This restaurant is open only on Lunch time (11:30am-3:00pm) and Dinner time (6:00pm-10:00pm). But, I advice to be there early (by early, this mean at least 15 minutes before the opening times) because there is always a long line even before the restaurant opens. The restaurant is not that spacious, so there are only around 20 people at a time.Upon queuing up, they will give you a piece of paper to fill up on what ramen you would order. I personally chose the Tongkotu King Rame ($10.80) + Special - All toppings (nori & flavored egg) ($4.00).They would also let you choose between light, normal, and high on the taste of the broth, amount of chicken oil and noodle texture. I kept mine at normal, but for the chicken oil, I made it light.The servings were big (for me), just right for the price. It comes with sesame seeds that they give you before serving the ramen itself, so you can freshly grind. The flavored egg, when cut in half, has this free flowing yolk that is just heaven. The pork is tender and a lot. There were unlimited hard boiled eggs and bean sprouts readily available at every table.The price doesn't include the service fee, so bring some extra cash with you. Oh, they don't accept credit cards, so you better have some cash on hand
4
Have always loved my Ramen! I did some research on Ramen King competitions and made a trip here. The meal is great, tasty! Seating is a tad limited, I foresee an expansion or a second branch someday, perhaps? Will definitely return when I can.
4
This place is pretty tiny which means you might have to line up given its popularity. Came here for lunch on a Saturday thinking that there wouldn't be many peopl, but there was still a queue. Moved fairly quickly though and we didn't have to wait too long. Ramen was very decent, some of the best I've had in Singapore. Cash only
5
Aside from the queues, this place serves one of the best ramens in Singapore I have with an okay price too.They serve one main pork broth which you can have as original flavour, or choose to have black pepper or red chilli versions with it. Great atmosphere inside, which is themed in a Japanese retro style.Tip: Don't waste the delicious broth. Order extra noodles for $
4
Be it during lunch or dinner, the long queue outside the store probably says it all. The ramen scene in Singapore is getting explosive these days but personally, this could be one of the best Tonkotsu pork base ramen in Singapore. Just like the eateries in Japan, open kitchen concept in a small shop. It is constantly crowded due to it's small capacity, so be prepared to queue longer especially during peak period. Like your usual ramen dining, you'll be given a order slip to tick your ramen preference.Tonkotsu King has unlimited serving of hard boiled eggs & really awesome bean sprouts. These appetizers add on to satisfy your ramen fix. Tonkotsu King Ramen ($10.80) + All toppings ($4), reasonably priced. Very rich and flavorful pork base soup, 2 big slices of char siew, nicely done runny egg, springy noodles, your best ramen experience.Though this is not the best ramen I ever had in my life but is probably the closest you can get to an authentic bowl of ramen in Singapore. Highly recommended! Nonetheless, Ichiran will still be the best ramen I've had till date. Post- http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2014/02/ramen-keisuke-tonkotsu-king-orchid-hotel.htm

Went there for lunch and had to wait in line for 20 mins to be seated. A nice touch is the free cold barley drinks for all waiting patrons.Had the spicy ramen with extra seaweed and flavoured egg at SGD 2 a pop. Thought that this is way over the top. There was a little pastle and mortar where you crush black and white sesame seeds as garnish for the noodles.The broth was very decent indeed and the noodles was perfectly done. The slices of pork was melt in mouth quality.Oh yes, for the price of a meal, you get free flow hard boiled eggs and pickled bean sprouts.Price wise, for a standard bowl of ramen, it was decent but skip the extras
3
The highly raved long queue ramen from Keisuke's 2nd outlet! It offers a chicken-based ramen, which is available only in Singapore!! I have tasted better ramen than this so personally not my favourite, it tasted average for me.Similar to Keisuke Gyoza King, both have cramp sitting capacity. This outlet offers free flow of hard boiled eggs and beansprouts.Read more about it on http://nkikichua.blogspot.sg/2014/01/keisuke-tonkotsu-king-orchid-hotel.htm

Like the hole in the wall atmosphere. Organized chaos inside.Eating on the clock no pressure whatsoever. Servers are very veryHelpful. Lovethe condiments and the free eggs.I base my ramen on the stock. The stock is perfecto! Nothing negative about thePlace at all. Perfectly served and home to come back one day. Well worth the 30 min wait.Get your ramen firm! Yummy
4
We wanted to have lunch (and we did!) at Teppei but the queue was really long. However, Keisuke's queue was moving along much faster. So we decided to first have ramen! We tried both their "No. 1!" and "Signature !" ramen with normal on all other options. Although their signature was not bad (black spicy), the plain tonkotsu was much better. Fast and efficient. We had to walk to the food court and back, only then we managed to get in Teppei
4
Don't come here trying to impress any friends it's a down to earth basic truly good ramen stall. Minimal service maximum atmosphere. Lots of bean sprouts and eggs you can eat for free. Soup base is great ramen can be more tender but hey everything works together really well
5
Literally a stumbled upon place right beside the tanjong pagar MRT station. i tried the black spicy broth with the flavored egg, I was in noodle heaven. Forget about the cramped space and the 4-item menu. There are so many Japanese eating lunch here! Plus unlimited hardboiled egg and bean sprout sides, it simply is such great value
