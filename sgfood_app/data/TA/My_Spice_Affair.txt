Visit Aperia Mall during dinner time, the taste of the foods are nice especially the fish head curry and the Ayam Masak Lemak Cili Padi (Chicken in Coconut Milk with Birds Eye Chili) in the Nasi Ambeng. Very Authentic, worth a try.

Curries, sauces and gravies are packed with ingredients and flavours have that home coming feeling. Situated in a nice and airy mall.

went to my spicy affair for lunch. I loved the food and it was really reasonable in Singapore standards

They are selling Malay dishes. The food is nice but the price is high. You can get mee rebus outside like $3.50. However, they are selling $4.50.
