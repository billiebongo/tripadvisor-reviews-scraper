Be prepared for crowds. So, avoid peak hours ! Halal food and drinks served at foodcourt prices - so, $4 to $8 range, I find their ice lemon drink abit pricey S$1.70 compared to other places (S$1.30). Find a table first. Queue for drinks separately, and food separately at different food stalls e.g Japanese, or Korean, etc.If you love local food, go for the Oyster Omelette, or Fried Kway Teow or Popiah or Carrot Cake (black). I ordered the Kway Teow as I didnt want to wait too long. Since it was quite a popular stalll, there was a long queue waiting. Maybe because it was cooked by locals, that is why the authenticity is there.I also ordered a bento set comprises of rice, fish and fried ebi (prawns) from the Japanese stall. The Korean food is also worth a try. I would say economical price. Just remember it is a foodcourt, not a restaurant.You have other stalls to choose from like Nasi Padang, Western, Chicken Rice, or Noodles.As Tripadvisor does not have a "GOOD" rating for me to select, I chose "Very Good" instead of "Average". To rate it as Average is unkind as my family and I really enjoyed our meals. For service, I chose "Average" because this is a typical scenario when the queue is simply too overwhelming to provide VERY GOOD service. Can't blame anyone
