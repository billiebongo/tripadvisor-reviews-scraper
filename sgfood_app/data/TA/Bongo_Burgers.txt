i was craving for a burger and made my search and found this restaurant. The burger was very good. It had a unique test.

Went to Night Safari early before 7pm and decided to have Bongo Burgers for dinner.
We ordered the beef burger as well as the salmon otah burger. Fries were huge. Taste wise was alright
Cousin enjoyed the Singapore Sling.

Great little spot in the park to eat lovely food, lovely service and good clean facilities. Highly recommend if you visit the birdpark

Good for kids, pleasant environment and staff. But the price is on the higher side. Burgers and Chicken Nuggets are excellent

Fish and chips was ok and so was child menu ... but the burger was horrible for a place with burger in the name. Ours had bones or something in it ... ruined the meal.

I had heard a lot about the Bongo burgers and wanted to try one out. The burger was strictly ok but priced atrociously. The iced tea was just water with sugar. Avoid.

We were visiting Jurong Bird Park and were getting hungry, I had seen Bongo Burgers when we had entered so we headed on over. They are located at the entrance just outside the park.We entered and viewed the menu board, the priced were a bit steep but we were hungry and decided to order. My friend ordered the Jumbo Fish Burger at $15.90, I ordered the Bongo Burger which was also $15.90. after were handed a little buzzer that would go off when our orders we found a table and took a seat.The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. The bathroom is just outside the front doors and to your left. There is room for close to 100 inside and there are some tables set up outside as well.My order was up first, it looked good, it came with fries and some chutney. I was getting ready to taking a photo of my order when I noticed that my plate had greasy finger prints all over it and I hadn't even touched it yet. My friend order soon followed, it looked good to, my friend took a bite and she didn't look too happy. Both orders came with fries, we were given one packet of catchup each.I tried my burger, it was alright but it sure didn't taste like a $15.90 burger. I asked my friend what she would rate her Fish Burger, she said 2, I would rate my burger a 3 at best. The fries weren’t too good ether, kind of mushy inside like they were made from mashed potatoes.So we are at a 2.5, I'm going to be kind and rate Bongo Burgers a 3 when it should probably be closer to a 2

We were looking for vegetarian fare after the bird park visit - and found only very limited options. They had only one piece veg burger and a veg pasta. The pasta was okay but the veg burger had only bread and vegetables without any patty and all this for high price. We finally had to get back into the park for an Indian vegetarian biryani meal.Maybe it was the timing of our visit to the restaurant - but given that a lot of Indians visit I would have expected management to be better prepared with option

We ordered otah burger, spring chicken and jalapeño cheese sticks as well as two iced drinks. Food tasted good, but wished the portion could be bigger (though the playing looked large, but food portion wasn't) for the price of about $80. And it was self service from ordering to collection of food. Expect 20-30 minutes of waiting time. The place was very hot due to the weather and no fans provided. The place turned even hotter even at the unsheltered seat area once the fire stage show. However, plus point is the diners got to sit and enjoy the show clearly while eating. I wouldn't mind to visit the cafe again if there is any promotion given to the local tourists or certain credit card holders. :

We had dinner at Bongo Burgers in Night Safari because our admission was at 915pm. The Set Meal was pretty delicious and the beer. However, the price is very high. With SGD45.00 as the admission ticket, i expect cheap food in the park but i was shell shocked by the ridiculously high inflation of the food and drinks. Same goes for Singapore Zoo and River Safari..

Bongo serves Fantastic burgers and fries. This is in a nice location near the entry to Night Safari. The food even though slightly expensive is very good.

Loved the Burger and fries. Not overly over priced. My first western food during the whole trip (day 8 or so). Was nice to eat a burger for a change.

To be quite honest not the best meal but the chips were great and the burger a decent size just not a lot of taste, but when in a hurry not a bad place to go.

Visited night safari last night with a friend from overseas n my kids. After I collected my order from the collection counter with no courtesy from a woman dressed in red shirt, she came to our table to snatch back 1 of the order saying we have taken an extra dish which doesn't belong to us when it is one of our order. When I showed her our receipt, she said she cannot see. Omg! My friend was disgusted n we went back to ask for the manager, this same lady came n merely said it was her mistake n walk away, leaving us in embarrassment amongst other diners n tourists. I will never never come to this restaurant. Very rude workers n food not valued for money

to be honest the price is on the high side. but what do you expect when you in a tourist attraction? i really like the fries they are like really fresh. doesn't taste like frozen one.i don't eat lamb but my wife said it was the best lamb burger she ever had. anyway there are not many places you can get a lamp burger. portion is big. chicken wing is no good

They are available both in Night Safari Entrance and at Jurong Bird Park.We had breakfast here during our Jurong Bird park Tour and Dinner during Night Safari.Excellent Barbeque Burgers and Fish n Chips were awesome . You can even watch the Night Safari Fire Show , while eating the meal. All in my family loved it. Something different from the regular Mac and KFC.Worth Eatery. Plus you get a Sovenier Cup with Every drink

Came here after a long day to have a late lunch. And obviously I was very hungry. First hurdle you will face is that the meal menus are fixed. You can't have just a burger, you got to buy the whole set. And the price starts at SGD 15 (USD 11). So if you bring 2 members of your family, it will cost you around SGD 85 (60 USD). Which would be a cost of 3 or 4 start restaurant. And trust me, the taste isn't good either

Having this at the Jurong Bird Park is a shameful and unacceptable dining experience that completely destroys the great attraction of the Bird Park itself.There are only (as far as we could tell) 2 places to eat in the bird park and this is one of them. The look of the restaurant is quite good with themed animal chairs and its quite fascinating for the kids. But the food is absolutely horrendous. We had the chicken burger and the beef burger. The beef patty was black in colour (and not from beautiful sear or charring) and had a rubbery texture, with a very processed, chemical taste. Buns were stale and flat, the lettuce was soggy and has probably been around a few days. The chicken patty was also stale and miserable. Fries were probably the only acceptable item on our plates and even then, it was just average fries. And none of the burgers were cheap. I really hope that something is done about this place as it is such a disappointing end to our trip to Jurong Bird Park

Went here while waiting to go into the Night Safari.It was very busy but we managed to find a table.Ordering was quick and easy and you are given a pager that lets you know when your food is ready.Yes it wasn't cheap but for a one off I don't mind paying a bit more.The burger was magnificent.A proper big meaty burger with salad on a bun.Not a trace of fat came out of it.I am not really a burger fan but I really enjoyed this one.It was a very tasty burger and the chips that accompanied it were proper chips,not them thin jockeys whips you seem to get served everywhere!Good food and really loved this meal as I was getting fed up eating rice every night.My experience here was great so I reccomend it

This is a pathetic restaurant but the best out of the lot in the Night Safari food court. Evan their French fries are bad. They have a captive bunch of foreigners who are far away from their hotels. By the time the foreigners get back to town it will be past 11 p. m. and it will be too late for dinner. So these guys strike while the iron is hot and they know for sure that none of these are anyway going to be repeat customers . They are all one off foreign customers theirs to be exploited. A small bottle of beer or a cocktail is around S$ 15
