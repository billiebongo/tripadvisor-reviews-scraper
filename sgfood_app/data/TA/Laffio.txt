Mains came in huge portion. Taste was on point as well. But the mussels are too salty for our taste. So perhaps the cook can go easier on the salt used. Overall pleasant experience!

Enjoyed the food at Laffio, especially their dry rub steak & chocolate lava cake. Appreciate that Laffio's efforts to remember my special request to serve the chocolate lava cake with a candle as the dinner was a birthday celebration for my friend.

For the location the food is actually pretty reasonably priced (Pasta is about $14). The food was not spectacular but the service was stellar!

Pasta was really good but others were a tad disappointing. The breakfast is decent but not value for money

this is a cool little spot that serves nice home cooked tasting food. i also like the fact that you can book it for small events or like workshops. could be interesting cuz it's not that big so probably affordable for a birthday bash or something. food was definitely yumm

Despite the heat and humidity, we sat on high stools outside the cafe, sipping our drinks and people-watching. I drank a delightful latte (made by Claire) and my man drank a beer (sgd9). I saw the all day one for one wine deal on a signboard. Awesome! But I saw the signboard too late.

A group of some 15 university alumni made use of the restaurant for an evening event (from 7 - o pm) that featured a guest speaker. The dinner set comprised a soup with bread, a bowl of salad and main course (either spaghetti with mushroom or chicken with mushroom). Most of us agreed the chicken item was good while spaghetti item was average. Dessert was a fondue fountain with choices of strawberries, marshmallow And bread slices

We (2 persons) had the Weekday Set Lunch for S$9.90+ and it included a sample sized soup of the day, main course, a small dessert and 1 mug of ice lemon tea. Totally great value. We had the Steak and Wedges and Roasted Pork Belly with Java Rice.The steak was a reasonable size for the price and tasty. The Pork Belly had a nice crispy skin and the portion was decent considering the set lunch price. Java Rice = Simple Fried Rice.The dessert was a home made tiramisu. The Mug of Ice Lemon Tea was refreshing.We also had an extra order of Buttermilk Waffles with Earl Grey Caramel and Vanilla Ice Cream. This was recommended by the staff.The decorations of the cafe/restaurant was interesting with a menu chalk board on one of the walls and interesting drawing art work on the others. Furniture was a bit more industrial looking but fit the place. The only negative point was the bathroom. The door was a flimsy folded door and the lock could not be locked. My advise, if you want to use this facilities, make sure a friend is waiting outside the loo

The visit was so "meh" that I really don't have much to write except that the food is common and mediocre. The signature dry rubbed steak was soft but the cut of meat was not tasty at all. The seasonings were Ok. The pork belly had a very strong "porky" smell and the skin was rubbery and hard. I actually got a refund for the pork though. So there was some service recovery. Waited 1 hour for the food.. Was told that there was only 1 chef due to some manpower issues. However... I guess that shouldn't be the customer's concern

Good choice of food and drinks, served within a nice ambience to shelter one from the hot sunny afternoon, here is the place.

Was there for V day dinner. The soup started out well but the mains were average. Probably should have tried their normal menu for a better review.

food is great, had a awesome dinner on valentines day. overall is a great experience. will definitely come back again!

Love the dry rub beef. The mint sauce at the side made every mouth delectable. Onion rings was nice too!

Big breakfast was big and great! Value for money and tasted really nice. Was sceptical of cocktails served in cafes in general. But i was wrong, their long island was a kick! Is not common to see waffles fries as well but laffio has it all ! Enjoyed my time here

It was surprisingly quiet for the value of food, drinks and ambiance they offer till 2am on that Friday. My girlfriends and I were looking for a place to chill and drink but found the neighboring Arab street a no-go with the boisterous music where we could barely hear ourselves. Laffio is facing the main street and thus might be a remote in that sense. But I think that's the good thing about it.. not many people know about this treasure yet ;) We got the beer bundle - 4 for $28! Give it a try if you're looking for a late night chillax place

I took roasted pork belly with Java rice as lunch set. They serve the home brew lemon tea and very yummy tomato soup. At the end the dessert with milky pudding.The price is only 10.90, not crowded as other places. Must try another dish again

Dry rub steak is nicely presented and taste good. Onion rings are crisp and not only. Food nicely presented. Restaurant has a casual setting but temperature can be less than optimal, beer not as cold as one would have expected. Only one staff available which can lead to some waiting time for service. Berry Good drink turn out to be more apple than Berry.

I had lunch here with my bf. Its a nice unexpected find. My bf purchased a groupon voucher at S$30+ for $60 worth value. We ordered a fried calamari, Laffio big brunch and dry rub steak. There seemed to be only 2 people in the entire restaurant so the service was a little slow. But the lady taking our orders was friendly and chirpy. I thought the portion looked small but it was pretty filling. The fried calamari was done well - it still retained its "chewiness". There were some fried lemon slices ( tasted like those preserved prune/snacks) served together which my bf enjoyed.. For the brunch, i had my eggs done at 66 degrees - didnt know what that meant but it looked like poached eggs. we chose the beef to be cooked till medium. yum yum. Will definitely return back to this place! There seems to be a lunch set menu at $9.99? probably will try that next time. but warning: do not come here if you are in a rus

I went on a weekday for dinner, less crowd & we able to enjoy the peace of Our time. Firstly the truffles fries good to taste match w real squeeze fruit juices! The pasta is moderate nice, yet the steak is tasty enough by the texture & juicy! Lastly it's a must to order choc lava cake, the lava flows sinfully match perfect with the ice cream it's so yummy that we both finish fast. Definitely a good chill especially weekdays.
