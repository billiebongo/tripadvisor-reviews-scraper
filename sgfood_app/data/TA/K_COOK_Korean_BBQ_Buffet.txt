This is All You Can Eat Korean Food, taste not really strong like Korean, but we Like it, and we've been here Twice. Great Taste, Great Price. The staff are Great Hospitality.

Visited restaurant with 4 others. Quality of food is average but variety of meat is lacking...maybe because it was lunch and lunch buffet is priced cheaper than dinner. But it had decent range of side and carbo dishes. Service was good overall.

2. What time do you have luch?

Went here on our first night as we wanted a relaxed easy dining option. We were happy with the service and the selection of food on offer. It was clean and the staff were helpful.

It was a good place for friends gathering with a reasonably wide range of ingredients for BBQ and beverages at moderate pricings. Staffs were friendly throughout even thou it was a very busy night.Would be a perfect dinner if they had a bigger table to cater for our bigger sized group. Appreciate the person in-charge who took the initiative to offer us additional table but due to the limitied length of the wirings, the two tables had to be some distance apart, hence declined his offer as we wanted to keep everyone together.Overall a good experience

We love korean bbqs!! his one has the best side dishes and meats as they offer it unlimited! You'll get what you want on their table, have a wide selection of meats (plain or marinated). Plus they have sea foods too! It is like S$24 per person, not bad if you have a big stomach

Living without pork just ain't living! You start to dream about it after a while...same goes with something spicy...The food here was delicious--it's buffet style where you cook and eat and cook and eat and then repeat--this was about as close as you can get to a Korean 'Sam Gyup Sal' place without being in Korea. They had 3 kinds of thinly sliced pork on offer and also we had the marinated beef...there were other choices too I think, but we paid no attention to them, because if you've been without pork for weeks, you want pork and some beef!I noticed a past reviewer had denigrated the cuts of pork on offer and frankly--these are the cuts Koreans love--the uncured bacon strips are usually called 'sam gyup sal' and they also had a marinated pork which is also common in korea. They also had the round cut, similar to a 'back bacon' but called 'mok sal' usually. These are the cuts that fry up best on a flat top grill.Anyway--you can go get your rice, your soup, your lettuce for wrapping the meat, your raw garlic (some like it raw, we like it cooked), your kimchi, and whatever kind of meat you like--get cookin and start enjoying.All the ingredients that we chose on our visit were fresh--the lettuce was beautiful and not wilted and had been washed. The pork, beef, garlic, and kimchi were also very good...I think the kimchi and garlic were not Korean because they were good, but not the same as Korean kimchi (the kimchi wasn't very spicy) and korean garlic. I was happy that I could also get a bowl of cal-rose type rice as its a little shorter grain and sure is less watery than rice in Indonesia.Almost forgot the mushrooms--the small ones and the pine mushrooms when fried were delicious, you can add a little sesame oil and salt to them--I'm starting to slobber now. They really went well with the beef.There were no complaints, the lunch price is $14 sing/cad/aus plus taxes I think, and for the price--this place was great value. Plus, you can only eat noodles and chicken for so long before you just need to have pork and beef.The place gives you about 3 hours to eat so this was good--they also changed the hot plate when we had some oil build up. Our first burner did not seem to get hot enough so the staff also changed our burner.Being in Singapore--the hygiene standards and food safety standards here were good--the frozen meat was separated from the vegetable and you're encouraged to take as many plates as you need to keep things separate. This allowed me to actually enjoy my meal--Singapore Rocks!Would eat here again and come back in a heartbeat

We had dinner here and the food was great and reasonably priced. The ambience was great with outdoor seating available. The selection of food was definitely satisfying. The service was quick and efficient. Overall I am very satisfied with my dining experience. They even provide Febreze on the way out for you to freshen up which is well thought of

Good food and reasonable prices, about $25 Australian for the meal and extra for drinks. The meal is fine maybe you will find better quality meat at the more high priced Korean restaurants but you will pay the price. This is good dining at a fair price

There are a lot of places to eat around Orchard and We just came cross K.cook korean BBQ. The restaurant'ssetup was alright. Spacious area for dining and food is located on one side of the restaurant. The food was also excellent at a reasonable price. Would easily recommend and will come back again next time

The place is very cramped and the table for eating is small. We had to make sure that our plates are cleared immediately but since the place is understaffed, I guess it cant be helped.
Money is worth though. Lots of variety.

Food is limited. No sauces available. If you go to this place you should be starving so that, you can taste the food nice..
We didn't really enjoy this buffet. End up eating watermelon. Not worth every penny.

the food and price is affordable. the staff is friendly and the ambience is cozy.
My family and I all enjoy our meal there.

The buffet was good for value especially for the cooked foods like chicken wings and pork belly. The bad thing is the size of the pan and this let the remaining table space for customers rather small.

I had a business lunch here and was pleasantly surprised by it. Lots of meat and they were well stocked with not only nicely seasoned meat but salads and deserts were ample too. We ate well between 2 big guys and it didn't break the bank - $58 for two buffets. It wasn't too crowded as we got there late, around 145pm. If you can bear the Singapore heat, sitting outside with the large bladed fans above can be quite comfortable. Better than being cooped up in an enclosed smokey smelly BBQ restaurant!Nice find in the heart of the Orchard shopping district! Will recommend it to my carnivorous friends

Had lunch with my friends at K. Cook, I got to say this is way better than Seoul Garden as the food was so much authentic, especially the 떡볶이 (tteokbokki / a sticky rice cake). I would recommend anyone who have yet to try Korean food, to drop by this place and have fantastic lunch/dinner with your friends/family. Service was great, we left at near 3pm (the time the restaurant closes for break). When we first enter, staffs were welcoming and was cheerful. Sadly, we saw some of the staffs look unhappy with us and were talking about us, apart from that everything is fine. I will still rate this restaurant excellent for the food and facilities even though the service by the staff was bad when we were about to leave

Took a friend out to dinner and decided to go to K.Cook at Orchard Road. For what you're paying for, this roofdeck restaurant is definitely value for money. The concept is simple: you choose from a selection of cooked and raw food that you cook on your table grill. K.Cook offers 2 seating areas: outdoor terrace and airconditioned indoor area. Both areas have these industrial suction powered vents that try to make sure that you don't end up smelling like grilled food after your meal. I think it worked. :)The cooked section offers a good selection of Korean favorites, from bulgogi to chap chae. The raw section is similarly varied, from vegetables to pork, chicken, beef, tofu, and seafood. Service is calm and friendly (though you do need to call for service every now and then but hey this is a "self service" establishment)

Nice korean bbq buffet that serves a good range of marinated meat as well as side dishes like chap chay, cheon (aka korean pancake) and kimchi. The chap chay and kimchi is the best I've tasted served in local korean bbq restaurants so far. Good place to chill if you are in orchard with a view with a group of friends or family

Chanced upon this restaurant while shopping around. We were offered seats in the non-conditioned area. Fortunately it had large fans to circulate the air. The buffet spread is pretty good with cooked and raw food. K-pop fans will love the place as it has a big screen that showed the latest music videos and Korean stars.

Here are many food outlets to serve different people. Serve many meats - beef, chicken, pork and some sea food (pawn n squid). There is indoor and outdoor. The outdoor is having two big fans to circulate the hit air.The price is value for money
