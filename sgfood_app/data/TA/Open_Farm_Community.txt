We ordered the beef rendang pasta and the mudcrab lemongrass pasta. The Been Rendang was a bit too rich and thick and personally I didnt enjoy it but the mudcrab lemongrass pasta was really good and I would thoroughly recommend it.

Small dishes to share. All of them are delicious and yummy. They had a new menu when we went and it was refreshing. But slightly on the expensive side. Oh ya, reservations in advance is highly recommended

Visited OFC sometime mid 2017 & the food was pretty damn good. I remember a seafood risotto, etc. Amazing food. Imagine my surprise at a completely new menu when I arrived recently & judging by Chope's information, they obviously had no idea that the chef left and that there was a new menu. Place was still great. Chill. Service was with a smile but basic. Food was terrible. A poor attempt at blending Singapore's flavors with modern techniques. The Chye Poh dish was absolutely terrible. Reminded me of frozen prata lazily wrapping a potato & drenched in oil. The ratio of the rendang pasta dish was obviously just a dish that was not considered enough. Too much meat, strong flavors and overpowering. The pasta too little to balance the dish. Once again, drenched in oil. The seafood pasta was tasteless & drenched in oil. (see a pattern?)Sadly, this place had good food. Sadly, I thought I could trust Chope too but it seems like they were too lazy to bother updating information. 1. Place obviously lacks a head chefWhy? The menu, service & overall running of the place lacks direction. I've worked for a place with a head chef & after he left & the service, food, etc were all similar. OFC needs to get in a head chef with experience. Fast. 2. A lower price doesn't mean guests will be instantly happier. Sometimes people are happy to pay for quality food and a good concept. 3. Poor communication to partners. Chope is still marketing the old OFC, a platform most people are booking from. This is misleading information that would just piss old customers off especially. Do your work! Whoever is managing OFC is obviously sleeping. I really like the place & hope it improves & finds it's footing again

Dear OFC, today was my second time. The reason why I came back was because I loved how wholesome your food was last time. The flavours were surprising and no-nonsense. But today when I came and saw that the menu was just small plates, I was thoroughly disappointed -you only kept a few of the dishes from last time and on top of that the dishes in the omakase was really, seriously lackluster. The tempeh salad I could have made myself, and the tamarind sorbet was an... acquired taste. Last time you guys had gnocchi, you guys had nice seafood. Now it's all pretentious french influenced small plates that seem try hard. It's pushing your fans away -the table next to me left after 20 minutes because what they wanted from the old menu was not on the current menu. Change the menu back to what it was, get rid of the pretentiousness and we'll come back. You were so good before, now you're just mediocre. Bring back old OFC. Also, ask your waiters to mellow down their service a bit -they were literally at my table every 15 minutes to serve food, to clear plates, to fill water, to do whatever -it's way too much! Chill guys chill..

Staff are very welcoming, I enjoyed the interactions with staff. Warm, comfortable ambience. Food is pretty decent despite the limited choices.Trending fusion cuisine. Had omakase that is more value for money. It's worth a shot for the food but not a 2nd visit. I am feeling terrible about this mixed feeling review
1
This used to be a fav for dinner but the new menu is a massive let down. When we saw the small dishes on other tables we thought these were sides... The net result is that you will end up ordering more food? is this the plan to make more money? just go back to the old menu which looked better and didn't seem like a ploy to get more revenue
3
Had high hopes about it so was quite disappointed when we finally got there. The food menu is very limited and pricey for what you get. Taste of food is so-so nothing unusual. The "farm" is really just 1 or 2 patches of "garden" which had weeds all over. Dont expect a real "farm" experience
3
For all the hype this place receives I guess I expected more. It was still fine though. We both had the Christmas lunch and perhaps we expected more of a Christmas vibe.We had a lovely seat outside looking into the garden and the service was fast. The quality of the food was fine. The options were pretty limited especially if you don't eat much meat... but all in all it was just... fine
1
Visited the place with high expectations of good food and atmosphere. However, food portion was so small that I wanted to throw back the food at them. BBQ spring chicken cost $25 but what I received was 4 small slices of chicken. Chawanmushi was just a small little bowl and cost $14. Overall I spent $91 only 4 small little dishes. My first and last time coming here. Bad experience.
2
The food is lovely. The prices for what you get is bordering on extortionate. If you have more than 3-4 people expect to order most of the menu. There are a lot of fine dining establishments in Singapore that provide better value. This is a causal restaurant that is pleasant and enjoyable except when the size of the food arrives compared to the size of the bill. Fine charge a lot but when it comes to inexpensive food cost items like vegetables. Donâ€™t treat them like caviar or fois Gras.
5
Awesome ambience with a cosy touch in the restaurant.
Food was good though slightly on a pricey side. Interesting menu with a twist in normal ingredients. Ingredients were fresh. Portion is a little small.
5
weekday lunch - not too much options but every single dish we ordered blew us away in terms of creativity, quality of ingredients and taste
4
Ideal place for business lunch or to chill out. Food has nice presentation and plating. Portion is small but ideal for a light lunch.

OFC is the kind of restaurant you go to only for the ambience, and even then, I don't think it's worth it because there are plenty of pretty restaurants that have better value. The portions are really, really dismal. The menu is extremely limited (the alcohol menu is extensive though). We got the grouper ($20) which was a very slender cut of fish that could basically be eaten in 3-4 bites. The crab pasta was slightly better in terms of size (for 2 people), but $25 for a few miserable sprinkles of crab flakes? You're better off going to Valentinos where you pay a bit more but get top-notch pasta. Oh don't even get me started on the kailan with mussels which had 4 pieces of mussel, a few branches of kailan and cost $16. I didn't find anything special about their flavors at all. There was also absolutely nothing creative about the presentation of their food. So yes, avoid OFC unless you wish to be ripped off in the most splendid manner possible. Instead of OFC, check out Corner House in Botanic Gardens - proper fine dining in a very beautiful setting, exquisite presentation, and only slightly more expensive if you go for the lunch menu

I was at this lovely space at around 6pm and we had a drink in the outdoor area while waiting for a friend! There were three of us and we had dinner inside the restaurant! The setting was nice! Food was good, Kale Soup, Flat Bread and the Broccoli Salad were delicious!
4
We decided to have our Christmas lunch at the Open Farm Community well knowing it was not serving a special Xmas meal. It was a very special lunch anyway. The setting is so beautiful and the food so fresh and interesting we were truly delighted to have chosen this place for our festive lunch
5
We had dinner at Open Farm Community. It's a really nice place, great for dates. The food portion was very small but the quality of the dishes are to die for. Even a simple plate of dish of quarter chicken can be elevated but it costs SGD25. Really impressed with the flavours though
1
I went there with a friend to have dinner, but their main courses were horrible. Our best bet was the omakase but that was a tad too expensive and the dish options were not appetising to us. In the end, we settled for a kids’ meal of fish and chips which we upgraded to adult size and had to pay an additional $6 for that. All they did was give us one more small piece of fish and a lot of fries... The place’s only saving grace is it’s atmosphere as it’s in the midst of greenery, but I will never ever go back there again.
2
It was the final day (today I wanted to review ASAP ) for visiting family and so we thought as a treat we’d go to OFC. I don’t know what has happened but the service was all over the place and we had to wait sooooooooooooo long for food to be delivered and then 4 of us had finished our food by the time 2 other main plates had arrived for my in laws. It was a real downer. I felt really embarrassed brining my family here and having to wait so long. On the other hand I love the brunch menu and the family thought the food was great plus the location is wonderful too. However there seemed no direction from the kitchen to get plates out at similar times and no direction on the floor at all. Here’s hoping things change. I really hope so.
2
I booked a table for 6 pax on the 1st of January for my birthday to bring my family and partner here. The place was highly raved about and I was excited to finally dine here but unfortunately it did not deliver. Let’s start from my arrival, they couldn’t find my reservation and the staff was visibly unnerved when I showed him my confirmation from chope. He eventually managed to give us a bar table which was pretty wide and not too great for conversations (and in this case, celebrating my birthday). He said that he would give us a regular table once any is cleared and we agreed — however even till the end of our meal no other table was offered to us. On food, the menu is unfortunately very limited and portions are small. My boyfriend and father both left not satiated from the meal. Quality of food itself is decent and some dishes are quite tasty but some dishes are an acquired taste (the salad is very raw). When I asked for the bill, the server informed me that they messed up our order (which we did not realise at all so it wasn’t a big deal) and therefore removed some items on the bill. They did serve me a complimentary birthday dessert which was appreciated. Overall disappointing, plenty or room for improvement but if you’re just looking for an ambient place for drinks, Open Farm is a great concept.

food is very fresh and ingredienta are locally sourced. overall good experience. will visit again with other friends
2
Hard to get a table, which is fine if the place is great but not OFC. The food is oily. The ingredients have hardly anything to do with the "farm" if at all. I would skip it.
4
Great food, atmosphere & service...just a lil pricey but overall a very pleasant experience:) Thanks OFC! Will be back!
4
Great experience! Good service, fish and chips on kids menu are to die for. Good atmosphere. Pricing is slightly steep but if you have an entertainer app makes it better value for money.
2
This place used to be a Favourite. We have been here multiple times, but it has been a good 6-8 months since our last visit. The menu is now limited, servings are small, the wine selection is also limited and most were not in stock. Service was appallingly slow and mistakes made, food ordered forgotten, bill was wrong and we had to ask twice for the bill and 3 times for another dish. The food quality was still good but servings so small so really expensive for what you get. Really astonished at what has happened to this old Favourite of mine
1
I am writing this comment live still sitting in the premises. We came here with my little son to have breakfast and enjoy the much praised playground. We arrived at about 10.15-10.20 and the staff informed us that they have run out of croissants. When I asked if there is anything else I could order for my 2 years I got the reply that I would have to wait till 11 when the restaurant next door opens. I order a coffee and asked kindly for a slice of a bread to keep the young one busy. 20 min later the waiter came to inform us that the slice of a bread was not possible before 11am!!!! So much about the concept of tranquility, respect to family and nature that the owners of OFC community. I am traveling both for work and pleasure around the world and I have to admit that I have never experienced such a “difficulty” to offer a slice of bread.... Shame
4
Intriguing and fun to taste fusion dishes that inspired my taste buds. But this may not be appreciated to the buck paid for every visitors. Still great place for relaxing coffee and tea in a relaxing and natural atmosphere. Playground and gardens cater well to the children, but for my six year old son it wasn't quite enough to have him play on his own (so I was dragged to the gardens after a while...)Overall still much enjoyable, and would recommend to those interested in looking outside of good but normal brunch options
3
Would be an excellent resturant if there are more choices with slightly bigger portions served. Prefer the older menu. Was on the verge of leaving as we came as a group and would want to order varied items for sharing. We decided to try out some items on the menu since we are already seated. Had to go to other nearby restaurants after this.
5
The transformation of ingredients into unique dishes is what amazes me at this restaurant. Steamed egg is not something I would eat but it was done so well here that it tasted like tofu. There are lots of great options in the menu. If you could not decide, let the chef do it for you. Go for the Omakaze - 6 dishes in total. If it's too much, ask to swop out 1 dish for tea or coffee instead. They are very flexible
2
They changed lunch menu to small plate. It’s so small that each individual doesn’t have enough food for the lunch. Delete this restaurant from my list forever:
5
First visit for me and it was a really pleasant experience. Food was solid and service was good too.
5
They just re-visited the menu and it is better, not so salty! The spring chicken BBQ is well recommended!
5
Wonderful experience, fresh and tasting food using locals ingredient, service is friendly with great selection of natural wine, perfect escape from busy singapore in the beautiful green garden restaurant. Come back this week...
5
Food quality was good but portions are really small. Restaurant is nice and cosy. I liked that they have their own little garden outside.
3
Nice relaxing ambience with outdoor tables that work well on a cool evening. There’s only one page of real food and the rest of the menu is focused on drinks. It’s an eclectic menu that’s somewhat Asian-European fusion. Each dish comes in small portions and is unique. We liked the flatbread with chai poh and the mud crab tagliolini. The prices are steep and frankly not worth it
2
To be honest we didn’t eat there once we saw the new menu. It is no sharing platters. Between the 4 of us we could see anything that we liked. When making such a drastic change to the style and menu you should update your website to reflect this to allow people to see the changes.
4
This is a very clever restaurant, keep the menu simple but make sure it’s well done, delicious and organic with lots of good wines and a friendly crew. We enjoyed our dinner in the party of 5 and got a table despite the crowd using chope reservations. The wine went well with the food and dessert was lovely too. It missed a 5 Star because it was pricey for the fare. Froglets and chicken should be a must try
5
After all these time. We ordered a second helping of the mud crab pasta because it was very good. So was the fish. Ingredient sourced locally, so it’s fresh. If you’re not familiar, it can be difficult to locate. Staff are friendly but need some effort to get their attention. When you do, it’s efficient
5
The place is as the name suggests - an open farm community nestled right off busy Orchard. It is a very welcoming and organic place, and the food is wonderfully delicious, though on the pricey side - you get what you pay for, I suppose! Found it very family friendly - my toddler entertained herself plenty checking out the farm and the outdoor playground. The kids menu was fantastic too - nutritious fare, not your usual nuggets etc.
4
Loved the deco and feel of the place. Staff were attentive and friendly.The food was good but I can understand some of the previous comments.Small portions for the price. More fine dining portions that don't seem congruent with the concept of "Open Farm Community"Usually if you want to create a more friendly and welcoming experience, the food portions have to be a bit more generous. Well that's my opinion anyway.Quality of food... I think 5 years ago it would have been considered good.But there are so many other great offerings today so I have to say it was only average in light of the general scene
4
Food is great but the portions can be bigger! The place is prettier during the day but it is much cooler to sit out al fresco in the evenings too.
1
We had the degustation for $65 per pax. Definitely not worth the price, as the food was average at best. And definitely not going back again.
5
Had my birthday lunch at Open Farm Community and it was great. Good service and the food was delicious as well.
4
Good ambience with nice food. Even thou the indoor area is closed for the afternoon, they are very kind to allow us to continue to stay on instead of moving us to the outdoor area. Good service
4
The place is definitely one of my favorite places with great atmosphere.
The food was delicious as well. Preferred the fillet of barra over the fish burger. Wished the basil dessert have more of that basil ice cream too.
Nonetheless, would go back again.
1
Waiter that served me was proud, arrogant and unfriendly. He acted like the customer. Price was very expensive for the portion of food served
4
OFC focuses on locally sourced, seasonal and innovative dishes. The food we had was interesting and well presented. Service was efficient, but not really warm or friendly. It would be great if OFC could introduce more food items as the menu has been the same for a while. If you visit in the day, you could at least see the beautiful garden. We had dinner there and as the lighting was rather dim, we couldn't really see much of the garden area surrounding the indoor restaurant
4
Our very first time here and certainly took us by surprise. For two, would suggest that you order about 4 different dishes to share. Portion per dish is not big but good for 2 to share. Try their bbq pork echine and also their flat bread chai poh. They source locally from local Singapore urban farms. For dessert try their sweet potato tart with gula melaka, so good!!
5
Lunch was the perfect meal for this pop up menu and collective and expectations were more than met. French classic technique applied to preparation and cooking but deceptively simple food where the produce shone. Light yet complex. Layers evident in each dish. Truly contemporary with a youthful exuberance yet sophisticated and beautifully planned. One of the best meals in Singapore and great value.
2
Nice place in a garden setting but a little dim at night. Bit dangerous and would like a little more illumination. Food presentation is better than the cooking. What we ordered were rather mediocre. There are better places to go to for dinner
5
It was my first time there with my family and dog and the people there were lovely. The service and food was great as well.
4
The fish and chip was tender with a crispy outer layer. It tasted different from other places. The fries were a mix of potato and sweet potato, why not?
4
Food was fantastic. Very kids friendly. Staff was helpful in recommending dishes to us. Will definitely come again.
4
The quality of the food was impeccable and service was very decent (just pray you don't get one of the temp staff to serve you).
I really enjoyed my pasta, and my dinner companions enjoyed their food as well.
4
fresh, healthy ingredients, friendly staff, cozy and relaxing surroundings. we felt like we were out of town in the middle of all the greenery.
3
Attended a wedding luncheon. Atmosphere is casual and open grounds beautiful in urban Singapore . Food is good , well crafted, some dishes novel. Service is friendly. I would recommend coming here for a casual unhurried meal. As a venue for major event with over 100 pax , opinion is divided. Car park is limited and hence some guests would have to park afar and walk in the heat . Service staff is inadequate and hence our event was 2 hours overRun as the food service was slow. Guests stated leaving before dessert was served which was so unfortunate for an event that started so well . Hence , recommend for a causal small table meal, caution if planning a major event if the ops cannot handle service delivery
3
I called to book reservation but they said cannot book, only walk in. But when I went there, I saw reserved tables? Confusing. The shocking part is the price. The price is fine-dining standard but it's not a fine dining restaurant? Not sure why it can be so pricey? Maybe their rental is super high? And the environment is super noisy, I cant barely listen to my date talking. The food is good but Will I come back again? I doubt so
3
Good food, good service, nice decor , generous portion size. The negatives - price - EXTREMELY high for the food being served - keep in mind this isn't a Michelin star restaurant nor are they using any special ingredients. You can see a lot of customers are sharing dishes rather than ordering a dish for each person. The price is just uncalled for.The layout is extremely noisy - as a mix of kids and families - poor interior acoustic design. On a side note - this place is pre-predominately occupied by expats, I only mention this as some people find this to be relevant in terms of expectations, costs and ambiance. Probably won't return unless prices to drop and to add some acoustic padding interior to reduce echo/noise levels
4
Located on Minden Road, Open Farm Community (horrible name, sounds like a hippy commune!) serves seasonal local produce. The food was imaginative and well presented. Don't miss the warm broccoli and feta cheese salad. Stunning decor. Ideal for all. Our only gripe was the cost - it's expensive, especially when you consider it's local produce
4
We were 6 friends for a lunch today and had a wonderful experience.Open Farm Community is located in a nice, green and calm area, perfect for a Sunday brunch!Food was excellent - the only poor item was the fries which were definitely not reaching the overall quality.My lemon tart was so yummy!!Service was ok.. Singaporean standards. Prices acceptables
4
Very good food, and nice concept. Their garden is nice to walk in. Perfect for a Sunday Brunch.
However service was quite slow.
4
If you want to try something different for brunch, you should give it a try here as it is not your conventional brunch menu at other places. It is also a family friendly restaurant as kids can play with their friends at the playground.
4
Ordered my favourite mud crab pappardelle and carbonara(still as good). First time trying the barramundi and lamb loin. Did not really like the lamb though. Barramundi was good. We had the cucumber cooler for drinks.. really refreshing! Love the ambience and service was great! :)
3
The concept is interesting - nice atmosphere and food is good. Family friendly so would not really recommend for business or romantic outings. Service could improve...
5
Amazing food: healthy, clean with loads of flavour.
Love the environment, it is cosy, inviting and i chatted with a friend there for quite a while.
5
I had dinner with two friends at Open Farm Community and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. We all loved the ambience - rustic decor which immediately made us feel comfortable and welcome. Service was very good - staff very attentive and we were given lots of great recommendations. They guy who took our orders actually spent quite a lot of time to understand what we liked/did not like, how hungry we were, etc. before making recommendations. We shared two starters - the warm broccoli salad and grilled prawns. Both were excellent. Normally I'm not a fan of broccoli but this salad made me want to eat vegetables every day! For mains I ordered the mushroom rigatoni, and my friends got the fish burger and crab pasta in curry sauce. All were very good. My rigatoni was perfectly cooked, with a generous serving of mushrooms. Sauce was excellent - hearty and rich with a full-on cheese flavour that really whetted my appetite. Both my friends also liked their mains. We also ordered wine and cocktails. They have a good selection. I found my green cocktail very refreshing and unique as it was made with fresh produce from the garden outside. Will definitely order again.Special mention to the staff who really took care of us. When we finished dinner it was raining cats and dogs outside and they actually took the trouble to shelter us with umbrellas all the way to our cars/taxi. Two thumbs up for treating your customers well!I will definitely return and highly recommend Open Farm Community to friends
4
Went with a couple of friends last weekend and really enjoyed our dinner. The food all tasted fresh, well prepared and nicely presented. The broccoli and feta salad starter (not my usual type of choice) was excellent. The feta really fresh and the broccoli cooked just right. The main of lamb two ways was not quite as exciting, but the pastas my friends had got really good remarks. The cherry chocolate desert was really good, but probably enough for two people to share. Which didn't stop me eating the whole thing, as it was so tasty. The rum and banana cocktail was great but a few more of those might have left me under the table! We'll be going back again soon. Possibly for lunch with our daughter, as it is really kid friendly as well
3
Those who have been to De Kas in Amsterdam know how delicious organic food can be - fragrant, sweet, allowing you to discover the earth’s bounty, with unusual textures making the vegetables/herbs/fruits shine. None of that here!! The food ranges from blah to good, but lacks diversity and freshness. Although you pay for the high prices of an organic restaurant, you’d be hard pressed to realise you’ve eaten at one. Friendly service staff, but extremely blurred - not capable of discussing the menu or dishes.
4
Star of the mains: Scotch eggs stood out from the usual Eggs Benny because of its interesting flavour burst. The spices hit all the right notes every bite. Smoked salmon was quite overdosed with cream cheese so we didn't really enjoy it that much.Ended the meal on a sweet touch with the delightful lemon tart. The crust is some crunchy goodness that keeps you wanting for more. If not for our exploding bellies, we would have ordered another.Will be back soon
4
Nice indoor and al fresco seating which kind of makes you forget where you are for a while. The food was good - the roasted red snapper (that my friend had) was delicious and of a sizeable portion. I also really enjoyed the lemon tart with basil ice cream - unusual but delightful flavours. Most commendable perhaps, would be the great service! Friendly and warm, the one attending to us even helped to sing the birthday song while bringing out dessert after dinner
5
This place should not be missed when visiting Singapore. The atmosphere is relaxed, not too noisy and the food is some of the best in Singapore. A lot grown right there!
5
We tried several great meals, all of the ingredients are fresh and full of taste.
The setting is very pleasant as well.
4
Had a girls' nite out to celebrate a birthday. Great food, atmosphere and excellent service. Pricey tho!
5
We had our anniversary dinner here today and we must say we had a superb time! Although the setting is not the typical romantic type, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! The garden outside is small but tastefully maintained, the food has interesting combinations and is impeccable and last but not the least, the service is efficient and friendly. The nice surprise came when one of our desserts had "Happy Anniversary " on it! We were already talking about coming back soon :)
3
Nice ambience but the food was not up to our expectations. Staff service is a mixture as we got a good servicing waitress while the waiter whom served us our food was not too polite
4
This is a great ‘concept’ project where an urban gardening collective meets a lovely rustic restaurant. The produce grown in the allotments is used in the food and drink of the eatery. The décor is very hipster/country with lots of wood and wrought iron. There are little bonsai trees for sale on the tables and everything feels fresh and modern. The menu is limited with moderate prices. The food is very British Gastro Pub with an international flare and plenty of the fresh ingredients. The juices and drinks were great as were the selection of starters (ranging from lovely mixed sweet potato and russet fries to a lovely tomato salad with a flare). The down-side was the service (possibly due to a mis-communication in the kitchen) but out of five diners one plate arrived 20 minutes after the others. This was also after two reminders to the waiters. I had a lovely fusion dish of pasta and curry and the tomato salad (which included a faux tomato made of jelly…impressive and beautifully plated). The drinks were great especially the juices and kaffir. We shared the chocolate desert at the end which was a medley of different chocolate mouse and brownies. Very decadent. Aside from the service issue, I would recommend especially as the sustainability concept is one that is close to my heart. You will need to drive or take a taxi to the restaurant so it is worth factoring this into your timings and costs
4
Nice ambience surrounded by so many greenery in Dempsey.Loved the relaxing settings and the high ceiling building. Open kitchen where you can see the chefs in action. Beautifully plated food and all tasted delicious. We had mud crab green curry pasta, and barolo braised ox-tail for main. Wine list was good with great selections from the classics to the less-known regions'.Well come back again

4 weeks ago I gave this place 5 stars and liked it so much we came back with friends. When I was writing the previous review I did notice some 1 star reviews and wondered how they could be so Low-now I know! 20 minute wait to get a seat even though we had a reservation and there were lots for free tables. Just no staff to seat us. 20 minutes at the table and no one came near us with menu's or to see if we wanted a drink. Anytime we wanted something we almost had to grab the passing waiter. I deliberately use the 'singular' here as there appeared to be only one. As for the food it looked like the Chef had left pictures of what everything was and then went elsewhere as it was awful. My barramundi was so overcooked it was mush. My wife's carpaccio was grey and salty and our friends Lam was bland.The piece de résistance however was the cheese plate- big square cubes of shiny processes red and white cheddar(and a little bit of blue) plus 3 big thick slices of Garlic toast???It is the worst I have seen in a Long time. Also the waiter was trying to be funny but he actually came off rude.Will never go back and would never recommend it agai
5
Excellent service, food and ambience. The bespectacled male manager (sorry forgot his name) at front counter working on 15th sept evening was most professional and helped us to get seats even though it was difficult. KUdos to the chefs for their excellent food in terms of taste, smell and presentation. Kudos to the waiters for their excellent service and recommendations
3
Firstly the positives. It's tucked away in Dempsey which is easy to get to and has its own parking yard. The ambience is good. A kind of metro farm feel and the restaurant was spacious and not too busy for our Saturday night dinner. There is an element of an organic theme.The negatives. On arrival we waited in a queue for 15 minutes outside the restaurant while an obviously broken system made patrons wait despite table bookings and it appeared only one staff to run in and out. It was a shambles, so not a good start.The pricing is at the high end which is not surprising for Singapore but it didn't deliver across all fronts. The brocolli starter was great but the lamb mains was terrible. Fatty and not worth the money given portion size. The worst was the cheese platter which was $36 !! It certainly had quantity if you like red cheddar and compte but for that money we expected a decent selection of cheeses. The funniest part was the cheese had been cut into blocks which were larger than lego pieces in size ! Wine list was very ordinary so nothing to recommend there.The service in the restaurant was polite but clearly short staffed. Took ages to get attention. We ordered wine but it appeared to have been forgotten. The staff were sweating and maybe a bit to casual at this price point.In summary we were disappointed. The place has a lot of potential but we wont be back to experience any improvements..
5
We (family of 5) celebrated birthday & anniversary tonight at this whimsical restaurant. We thoroughly enjoyed the delectable dishes, creative fresh cocktails and desserts! Delightful customer service too! Will be back for sure. Thank you for a wonderful experience.
4
Nice menu , good choice of wine and enough space for the kids to run around
We went early evening and pleasant atmosphere
Good family restaurant
5
Nice ambience and good food. The food is unique and my family really enjoy. Nice play areas for kids
4
We enjoyed the ambience and the food was good. It was nice to walk our dog around the compound while waiting for our order.
4
We had a very nice evening here in this charming setting. The service was very friendly, the restaurant area lovely and the food was beautifully presented and good though not exceptional . We didn't get our main courses together which for a restaurant in this category was unexpected. By the time the drinks went on the bill it was altogether a pretty pricey night out but our bowling before and after dinner on the green in the lovely wild gardens contributed greatly to a lovely evening out.
3
nice ambience and liked the fact they cook the vegetables that they grow with! However felt the food was abit too pricey for the portion of the food served. Taste-wise was also decent but nothing to shout about i felt.

The space is beautifully appointed and if you like quiet gatherings in the woods it doesn't get much better than this. However the food was disappointing. My oxtail didn't taste like ox tail and the pasta was too al dente for me (but that's a preference). The frogs legs were only so so but the spring chicken was succulent. Dessert was a super miss as the bandung gelato was bitter and had an alcoholic tinge while the sponge cake was bone dry and the calamansi puree was sourness to the max
4
In short, the food is tasty and healthy. The dessert are simply amazing!The scenery is also very nice. The staff if carrying, listening and very friendly.The price is honest. Maybe the only bad point is that inside it is very very noisy. Maybe something to do with the structure of the building...I recommend

Had the BBQ chic , tender and tasty , the deserts are good too , been here thrice and never had bad food - can not say the same on service , little smile if they can wear it will be great to be back for a meal
5
The location of the restaurant is tucked away. You enter and are greeted with the sight of lush greenery and a beautiful sculpture garden. The whole place is one of upmarket informality. The food is innovative and interesting. The flavours are fresh, with organic produce often harvested from the restaurant's own garden/farm. Despite the fact that this is very close to "fine dining", the prices are reasonable and good value. A very special place for a great meal.
3
There could be better options provided for vegetarians.
The A.C. was not working making the restaurant very hot and uncomfortable
4
The food was nicely executed and so yummy! The only downside is that it is on the more expensive side. Two of us spent slightly more than $100, with 2 main course and 2 drinks (a cup of coffee and a glass of cocktail)
4
Has a very interesting and meaningful farm to table concept but unfortunately the red snapper was overlooked, dry and tough.
4
It was a rather humid and warm afternoon so the airconditioned seating proved very cosy for my little girl. Did take her one a walk around to the cafe and the slope up the garden, we didn't find the rooster on our walk but later saw it hiding behind some fence from inside the restaurant.The food was pretty decent fare but we found price a little high. Guess it's cos our economy is where home grown foods are charged a premium.Will bring baby back again
5
I am always a bit dubious about places that call themselves a 'new concept' as on many occasion a visit ends in disappointment with over complicated, over priced food and service that goes out of its way to be off hand however Open Farms is a definite exception. The food all tasted amazing, the fish tasted like it had been caught 10 mins before we ate it. The Lamb tasted like what we kill and eat on our small farm at home and the mango and coconut dessert was to die for. Even the broccoli salad was so good that our kids had some and normally they run from broccoli!The staff were also amazing and could not do enough to be helpful. We will definitely go back. Price would be at the higher end but to get farm fresh food on out small island with limited agriculture that is to be expected and it is definitely worth it.Everyone should try this place at least once
4
Very friendly staff..............................Very presentable plating........................................Too.bad that I was being.chased off due to another big group booking..
4
The range of home grown, organic food, and the inventiveness of the (drinks and food) menu is truly impressive. Obviously vegetarian, but also gluten free tastes are very well catered for. Most of the produce is fresh (from just outside the room often!), and low air miles.The service can sometimes be a little slow - the wait staff need to be more aware of diners (and I've eaten at the edge and in the centre of the main room). The food really is excellent in taste, texture and variety, but I found it a tad over-priced. In particular the cheese board, at $36 which is supposedly designed for sharing is actually OK for one person - should be half the price, like the other desert
2
Initially when I browsed the website, it looks quite cool place to hang out, but actually there is nothing there, jsut couple of kid's playground and one small shop beside the restaurant.I tried the food,out of 4 dishes, only one of them is nice, the rest doesnt taste good, plus it is expensive for the portion that serve you.Their service is normal but can tell they are a bit arrogrant, cos maybe their business is quite good.Nothing fantastic about this place, I will not visit this restaurant again
3
Nice surroundings.Nice layout.Nice looking food.That's all really.Is it really organic?Is it really that nice?Nah.... It's just hyped.With a small portion of everything, and at a cost that will thin down your wallet, there are other cafes out there with good food, service and ambience.Only thing was that food were all done up beautiful. And oh.... The coffee!?! Was amazing. Well... Decor was good too
4
Such a nice atmosphere even on a Monday evening and very lovely staff. Waiter brought us a new pot when he saw that I had finished the first pot of homemade tomato ketchup which I told him I found delicious. We always enjoy the food when eating here. Load up on mosquito repellant if you're planning on sitting outdoors! Despite this, would recommend and definitely return.
5
Definitely worth to check out this place for their unique food ingredients used in the dishes and lovely taste. Service was prompt and also clear explanation on the dishes.
4
Interesting farm and child playground. Ordered the oxtail Pasta but the food was not served hot. Waitress not as knowledgeable about the food they have in the menu they served. But food is nice.
5
From farm to table...they've really done that! The menu was also diffferent from the last time I went so keeps things interesting!
5
Fresh food, great flavour combinations and great drinks menu you can't go wrong. The staff knew a lot about the food and made some great recommendations.
4
Admittedly the location is a bit challenging on public transport, but once there, the food is really great! My friend was disappointed that they changed the menu, but for a first time visitor like me, I had a great experience. I tried the Barramundi.
4
In the middle of Dempsey but still rustic but classy to feel like a farm and a fancy restaurant. Would build out the menu a little more to include more vegetarian options though.
4
We, 3 ladies, ordererd 3 fish mains and all were good. The fish burger came with lots of potato and sweet potato fried. Nice! The chocolate boom and lemon tart were excellent. It was very noisy though as there was a table celebrating a birthday! Perhaps the acoustics should be looked at. Air con broke down for a little while. That didnt distract from the good food. Will go back again
1
The service just made this visit an awful experience!! We waited over an hour even though there were 5 tables available- they said they have to keep reservations for 1.5 hours (ridiculous!). I ordered the carbonara, my egg was raw (no warning on the menu) and when I asked for them to cook it more, the waiter was very rude and simply removes the egg from my plate.
3
First time visit this place. I think the owner tries to have a farm concept here but given the limited space in Singapore, do not expect to see a real farm. It does have some open spaces with herbs, or fruit trees... It is nice to see this in Singapore. Food is okay. We were given a table from 11:15 to 1:30pm. My friend said that the restaurant wants to have quick turn-around of guests so everyone can enjoy their food... I am not sure about this..
5
This restaurant is difficult to book at weekends as it's so popular so we went on a weekday at lunch time. It's got a cool interior....slightly industrial feel but don't be fooled, the food is stunning. Locally sourced and beautifully presented. We had textures of potato and grey mullet...two courses for 35 dollars and also snapper with charcoal barley. We had a side of corn done in different ways...popcorn, with paprika and served with chimichuri. Everything was just gorgeous. We then had a dessert....mango! It came charred and with a kind of rice pudding, a sorbet and fresh coconut....another triumph and plenty to share between two. We had a 500 ml carafe of wine and the bill came to 180 dollars. Not cheap but very much worth it
4
Excellent ambience and great service and food quality.
I love the surroundings, casual and chic and yet very friendly for family events on a lazy weekend.
Check out the plantation around the restaurant.
4
Tried a couple of their starters and mains, which were all great. Loved the how the food looked and tasted - good food good mood!
4
Food is very good, but our waiter is arrogant.
Our bill was around 200 sgd, it with this amount we expect better service. Our food was fantastic, dessert with mango is very good. Shrimps for starters amazing.
4
My Husband planned my birthday dinner here along with my kids. It's a beautiful restaurant, however it was extremely busy.
The food was good. We had an enjoyable experience here.
4
Very cosy place with polite and friendly staff. Interesting food variety and pretty plating, average taste.
Make reservations in advance and not they have specific seating timings. Driving is the easiest commute with complimentary parking available.
5
Was there on an early Saturday evening, the place was half full so the ambiance was pleasant. Food was excellent as usual, and service was impeccable. Food menu is inventive with many interesting choices. Three white, three red and three sparkling wines by the glass gives a nice selevtion to choose from.Nice setting and brilliant concept.Definitely a place to return to for a special occasion
1
Booked a table for a large group. We were constantly harassed by one of the staff to leave. We do understand that it was a Friday night and there may be a crowd. However, the restaurant was only half full then. He kept coming to us to remind us that we have to leave by 8.30pm as there's another group coming in by 8.50pm, there was no sight of the other group. But we were being chased out by the same staff. When the bill came, he purposely interrupted a couple friend who were trying to take a photo together by going in between both of them. There's so many of us at that table. What's wrong with him? We would be glad to leave n let the next group have the table if there is really been taken from 8.30pm onwards. But there clearly wasn't. We seriously do not appreciate being chased out this way. In the end, we had to move somewhere else to have our desserts n carry on with the birthday celebration. Food is not bad but not worth the price. Definitely will not be back for the bad service n pricey menu.

Service poor:- Water was not refilled unless asked or waiting for long time.- I have to inside twice to serve myself and my familyFood:- My broccoli salad was very salty- the carbonata pasta was described incorrectly and as a result we did not order the right dish.Last time we came was awesome and we were seating inside. This time bad experience
4
Love this restaurant. I took my sister who was in town visiting and it was perfect. We had to sit outside as they said they were preparing for an event inside. Luckily it wasn't a hot day and they do have huge fans which will mess your hair if you sit too close. The food was amazing especially the braised oxtail which my sister had. I kept tasting it. The waiter totally talked me out of having the fish burger so I went for fish and chips which was ok but that's why they get 4 stars and not five. The location looks great for kids as they have a sandpit and some climbing frames. I loved the roaming chicken and the overgrown garden is absolutely divine. I can't wait to go back.
4
The food is good and the staffs are very friendly except one who greeted us at the entrance (she looks a little fierce without putting on a smile) but that didn't affect us.The farm is small but nice to take a short walk in. Beware of mozzi esp for those whom mozzi are always attracted to..
3
i ordered the barbecue chicken think it would have come off a barbecue . but no ! it was chicken swimming in a barbecue sauce
5
I love the edible garden around the restaurant. We were seated indoors. Lovely atmosphere. The food was delicious and very fresh. Totally enjoyed ourselves celebrating a good friend's birthday.
3
fantastic venue, love the surrounding and the ambience of the restaurant. Food was just alright with ordinary taste (great presentation tho), and most dishes were on the salty side
4
Swung by with my daughter for drinks on a Friday afternoon.We didn't eat but did have two delicious mocktails.We also explored the gardens and games on the grounds. It's a fun place to spend a couple of hours. It has a cute shop too, selling take out drinks and a collection of baby related items
3
I'm a huge fan of farm to table and try to follow the "eat local" movement as often as possible. That being said, the concept of this restaurant really hit the spot. I loved the idea of the edible garden that welcomes you into the restaurant space with each plant labeled. Reading all the news and hype really made me want to come try it. I had high expectations which were unfortunately not met. Maybe it was the dish I ordered. The crepe was a little too salty (granted it was cured salmon) and just lacked an overall "party in your mouth" type experience. The restaurant has a great ambience. I may be back, but just for drinks
3
It's more of brunch, friends, noisy and fun environment where you choose to forget how average the food is. Had a cocktail and appetisers , carafe of white wine, risotto (which was good) king prawn was decent, both lamb and barramundi was sad. Pandan, lemon grass and sugar cane sorbet dessert would tell you how confused the kitchen is . The service team was TOP notch, actually... I would go back just for them.
5
What a treat. Unlike any other dining venue I have visited in Singapore. Ambience like a charming garden cafe, service happy and efficient, food delicious. Can highly recommend the garden pea soup appetiser. Casual quality dining. Loved it and will be returning often. Tip would be to reserve a table as this is obviously a well known secret!
5
Difficult to get a table there but it is totally worth it. In 4 years living in singapore it is my first time there and it won't be the last. The dishes are amazing. The place looks fantastic, you feel somewhere else. Service is pretty good. We had our 5 main courses in the same time. For that : 5/5. I recommande the beef cheek pasta and the lemon tart 
5
OFC offers truly memorable food in a delightful garden style setting. The staff are pleasant, the location is easy to get to (near U.S. Embassy) and offers reasonable parking. There are two things that keep the restaurant from being truly wonderful in every respect. OFC offers several house inspired cocktails, well made, but very pricey - their liquor offerings are decent in variety and well made, but dreadful in value, especially the house frozen cocktail Torch Wood which is simply stingy in quantity and dear in price. The same lack of value follows the wine and beer. The mocktails proved a hit with the kids. The other negative is the arrogance of the establishment with respect to its customers. I don't know what has happened with this place in the past, but the need to constantly remind, 7 separate times, customers about their reservation time grace periods and the 2 hour maximum allowable seating are just off putting. The also bring the courses very quickly- this is NOT a place to linger or enjoy a romantic evening, the business is food service and you'd better eat fast!So with those neagatives, why come here? For the food! The dishes are well made, artfully presented, served fresh out of the kitchen. The steak tartare was super, and the glistening egg yolk on top was almost too pretty to eat - almost. The pea soup was a perfect consistency and super fresh,served with a pickled onion slices were a great crunchy counterpoint. For the mains we had - basil gnocchi were superb with a added lemony twist, my son had the 48 hour oxtail ragu pasta which he was ecstatic about. My other son had the grouper burger and I had the mushroom rigatoni - quite possibly the best pasta dish (rich, full of flavor, and perfectly cooked) I have had anywhere including Italy and New York. The execution of these dishes was virtually flawless. For dessert, we had the house version of a lemon tart - fantastic flavor, but a lemon tart it isn't (Note to the chef, you cannot just serve lemon curd in some form and call it a tart). The other dessert was a carmelized mango with various textures of coconut - here the chef's creativity did not subtract from the flavor and delivered a winning original.OFC should rethink a few things and reconsider some of their beverage pricing points, if they do then they will be able to compete on par with the best restaurants around the world. As it is, so long as you know this is not a value oriented venue, you will not be disappointed, go to OFC
4
Had a lovely lunch at OFC once again. The Kale soup is tasty but a bit too healthy for me. The rigatoni pasta was just perfect. Super creamy and tasty. The chairs are a little uncomfortable for a 3 hour lunch but everything else was great. The tasty coffee is as always a big plus.
2
Unique atmosphere and unique style of plating. Chefs did a good job turning very cheap ingredients into plates of art. However portions are way tiny and priced very expensively. I could order 4 mains and still not be full!
3
Atmosphere was great with interesting decor and a small 'farm' area to explore. However, taste of food did not match their complex description that left most of us wanting. Pretty average food on premium pricing - you are basically paying for the slightly untraditional setting.
4
An interesting place! Mostly we had good picks. Absolutely yummy was the pea soup with Kale crisps n the Rissoto!
2
Understand that it was busy on Mother's Day, but not a single apology about the 30mins wait to be seated and over 1 hour wait for food to arrive. We asked dishes to be served as soon as ready. The kitchen staff could have at least send out our fries for the table to munch on while waiting for the rest. A real shame on a special day for our Mum. Overall food was great, except for the fish burgers that came out dry.
5
The name of the place lives up in the freshness of the food. Fantastic taste and great presentation. The bottomless bucket of drinks are a good value. Recommend the lamb, the pasta and the mango dessert. Wish they would add more vegetarian options as mains instead of just 2 pastas and sides. There clearly is more they can do with the fresh vegetables they produce.
1
Lovely place with exorbitant food and a plethora of other factors that made our experience (group of 4) here far from positive: 1. Poor service: inattentive, it took us a long time just to place order2. Time taken for food to be served: easily 45 minutes and we were really hungry (we had an 8 PM reservation)3. Environment: Dripping water from the air-conditioner, the staff was aware and actually let another group took our reserved table because the group arrived earlier and complained about it. Staff gave us an evidently "just suck it up" face when we alerted them about it.4. Promotion: we were informed that the establishment did not accept Entertainer 1-for-1 promotion; which I found surprising as it's the eve of Mother's Day. Mother's Day is NOT public holiday. I couldn't find any notice on the website or Facebook page despite what the staff told me.5. Overpriced food which isn't even good: my partner's charcoal burger bun was as hard as and tasted like charcoal. Food serving was surprisingly tiny. Our bill was ~$195.All in all, this place is really not worth a visit. There are many establishments in Singapore which are better in many many ways. Save your time and money, stay away
4
So the practicalities first:) we rode on our electric scooters so we had to a few steps to negotiate but that wasn't a problem at all. The place is accessible both by taxi and of course as pedestrians. It is pet friendly, has ample outdoor seating with a small cute green garden, sand pit play area for kids. And big fans outdoors to keep flying insects (that feasted on me this morning ) at Bay. Now to the real deal :-) Breakfast options are limited which makes it simplistic (I quite like that). Just 4 panini options prices between 12-16 dollars. Lots of options of coffee, smoothies, juices etc but NO EGGS. There is very small buffet option of a granola bowl with yoghurt @S$15. There are jars of butternut butter in different Flavours at 15$..pickled beet in a jar at 10 dollars. Saw the Chef plucking fresh herbs from the edible garden. So for a green lover like me the experience is quite perfect for a Saturday morning.Travel tip - ummm.. carry a mosquito repellant patch or spray.
3
Attended a business dinner here recently and enjoyed the Red Snapper main course very much. I have to admit I don't know how expensive the restaurant is as I did not pay the bill. I know this is going to sound trivial, but my biggest issue was how uncomfortable my chair was. I was at a large table in the middle of the dining room and I had a metal chair like you would see in an old primary school. By the time dinner was over I was so happy to get up and leave. I did notice that the chairs at the tables along the walls looked much more comfortable. One other thing to be aware of is that our taxi driver had a bit of hard time finding the drive way to the restaurant as we drove right past it once
4
We went there for my parents' 30th anniversary and it happened to be a fairly quiet evening at OFC on a Wednesday night. The waitress calmly helped me with my lactose intolerance queries and helped me decide on the mud crap curry pasta done without dairy. She even asked if we would like the other mains to be done without dairy so that we could share. At the end of dinner, we ordered dessert and it came decorated with a "Happy 30th Anniversary" message. Lovely
3
While the food was good, not sure if the ingredients really came from the garden (given the variety of herbs and vegetables outside). Don't expect a meal to be cheap. The bill came up to about $200 for 4, even with the Entertainer deal which offers 1-for-1 on mains. We shared a dessert and didn't have any drinks. The setting was nice but gets noisy when it's crowded. I felt service was lacking and staff weren't exactly friendly. Sure, they took orders and brought the bill to the table, but that's about it. Plenty of restaurants that could offer the same for a lower price.
5
A nice atmosphere in Dempsey, with fresh and tasty food. The portions aren't particularly generous however so I left dinner still feeling a little hungry!
4
Great place for couples / family. Food is great with good recommendation from the staff. Transport not the easiest there but worth the trip
4
Friendly and helpful service and really fresh food. We enjoyed the frogs legs, Laksa barramundi and the crab pasta.
5
This was a lovely dining experience. The food looked amazing and was full of flavour. Even though there was a big party of guests eating it was a lovely atmosphere and the service was excellent.
4
The setting of the restaurant is beautiful, in the middle of all the green. The structure is semin transparent (like a green house), shiny, warm and hip. The food is suitable for vegetarians (not sure about vegan) but some dishes are much more interesting and well served than others.The highlights were:- The brocolli and greens warm salad with feta- The fish on a bed of green barley and a beetroot sauce- The tapioca desertMy friend had a gigantic leg of a lamb and she was really happy. I had the crab tagliatelle, which was dry but worse, had only three small pieces of crab.Both the Cava and the Gruner Veltlinger for matching the meal were a good dry but robust combo,Service and atmosphere is very good
4
.....in the middle of agreeny area, where all make you feel like a farm - but is nice to run away form the messy Singapore and take a mental rest from traffic,chaos and noise. And on the top of this, there is a nice restaurant with top food , at a reasonable price ; so what are you waiting for? Try yourself the joy of the silence
4
I often choose OFC for my out of town guests if they don't have a preference for local food. The taste of the food, visual appeal of the plating, ingredient ideology, beautiful setting, location, and free parking make this an easy choice. The first few times I ate at OFC I marveled at the quality of the service and felt good about bringing guests and hearing their praise about the choice of venue and great service we receieved. I've noticed service levels dropping and while this is the first Friday night I've dined at OFC, I've never dined when the dining room was less than full. We had to call for service, ask two people for a dessert menu, and the smiles that used to be ever present were missing and replaced with some stoney looks. Not to mention how long it took for food to arrive. I was sad that the amuse bouche of sweet potato leaf also disappeared the visit.
5
Charming staff and lovely food. We only stopped by here for a light meal but we were very impressed. The curry oil dip with bread was a success. The pea and ham soup was one of the best such soups I had tasted and the pasta dish our one year old had was devoured with alacrity (and we checked...it was very tasty!). Well done the Open Farm Community
4
Went for lunch at the Open Farm Community and was pleasantly surprised arriving on a 'mini' farm in the middle of Singapore.The restaurant atmosphere is great with relaxed service and cosy decoration.All of the food was beautifully presented, unfortunately did not taste as good as it looked. The pasta with braised oxtail was really yummie, however the seabass could use some umph. The combinations were very good for sure, just missing taste.Desserts are as beautiful and definitely tasted delicious
1
Was there was a work event. Given the name of the place, I was half expecting to be served fresh farm produce. I was sorely disappointed. At the prices they charge, I expect my pasta to be made by hand, and not to come from a packet. I also expect to be served fresh, not frozen barramundi. Overall, disappointed by the quality of the food. Definitely not worth going
3
This place has a nice concept. The outdoor dinning already allows pets at the dinning table. Service was fast. Quality of food is above average but certainly over priced for the portion.
5
Great presentation and quality food, chef Russell and his team are lovely people who made sure that their guest were comfortable.
4
This restaurant does great tasty fresh food. I would definitely recommend. Dishes average between 20-30sgd per plate. Great in the daytime or at night. Since my first visit I have come two more times to show friends!
4
Great family spot. Had the fish burger which was delicious but the patty was way too big for one person; better shared. For dessert I shared the lemon tart with a friend and it was exquisite. Loved the farm feel!
5
Came here for dinner. We booked a table and that was a good idea as the restaurant was full. Very nice food, from starter to dessert. Good service and a nicely decorated restaurant. If you're in town, make sure you go. It's worth it!
1
The first time I visited the Restuarant I had a fair experience this was in March and yesterday when I invited some friends it was terribleService was poor, food was far too salty in spite of being told while we were ordering to cut down on the saltIt is unlikely for me to return a pity because the concept is great but they just failed to to deliver what they promise
3
This is an interesting concept with garden/farm, albeit very small, next to the restaurant which itself is very rustically set up. The only let down is the quality of food which is still some way to meet the perceived standard. I had fish burger and was not satisfied at all, not to mention at quite an astronomical price. The fish is a deep fried cutlet with the flour coating as thick as the fish, and this sandwiched in a burger bun--is just too much. The accompanying french fries is oil soaked and very thin. Definitely some review of the food is critical moving forward. And oh the service for lunch is needs to be improved as well--it takes far too long.
2
We ordered 5 different main courses and all of them was way too salty! Our entire group of 5 agreed that it all the dishes so it's not just a few selective tastebuds. Anyway, we had to send back two dishes. The place indeed has a nice ambience for brunch and their concept of farm to table is excellent. Plus a garden to walk around a bit. Service staff also tried their best on a busy day with a good attitude. Unfortunately it will be quite difficult for me to want to revisit in a Long time.
5
We visited on a rainy day and sampled the set menu. The surrounding gardens looked beautiful - a truly green space is so rare in Singapore. Food was delicious and portions were tasty. Staff were attentive but gave us sufficient space to savour a long lunch. We had two babies and felt welcome. High chairs are available
2
Food is arwsome. Fresh and vibrant. Service is terrible from the entrance. Lady in blonde surely is not experience. Ask the service crew for the manager, shock she pointed at her! I remembered an Asian Manager who was in charge but clearly, time needs to move
1
Waited for the food almost one hour with two young kids. The food then arrived in different times and half of it was cold.
4
Food was good, not great but great spot as this is away from the bustling city. Environment is pretty much mature audience except that there was flea going on that Sat morning.
3
We came here for saturday brunch and arrived just 3 mins before they opened. The lady told us they were fully booked for brunch already that day and they will only take walk-in 15mins later if there is anyone who doesnt show up for their booking as they only hold the table for 15mins. They put us on the waiting list and we were the first table on that list. We waited outside the restaurant for 20mins and I still saw lots of empty seats inside the restaurant so i approached the lady again to ask her whether we can get a table. She said she is still trying to confirm the booking with a couple of guests by calling them. Okey, so what she said about holding the table for 15mins wasn't exactly completely true then.We waited for about another 10 mins and were almost about to leave we got seats at a large table shared with other guests. We were also told to return the table 1.5hr later. We placed our order right away but the food took about 40mins to arrive and I was thinking all the time how much time we actually had left for us to enjoy the food. my bf ordered the buttermilk pancakes whcih were good but my oxtail pasta was slightly undercooked and the sauce was not flavourful enough.overall, I wouldnt be upset if you cant get a table here as the food and service were just average. during our 30mins wait outside the restuarant there were a lot of people who tried to do walk-in but they all got rejected. Some were put on waiting list and the restaurant would call them if there were seats but it didnt look like they got the table in the end because a lot of seats were left empty during the time we dined ther
5
Visited this tucked away restaurant, didn't have the Singapore feel at all, food was delicious and service attentive, really fresh ingredients, could do better with the wine selection though. Walked back to the hotel (a good 30-minute exercise) and it was most enjoyable going through some of the nicest neighborhoods in the city

DH and I went for a weekday lunch. We shared a pea soup, he had pasta strozzapreti and I had fish. We took separate cabs and neither driver could find the place - It's at the 'back end' of Dempsey Hill and it's a little difficult to find. The setting evokes a botanical garden - lots of plantings and raised beds, edible fruits/flowers, etc. It's rather unstructured and very 'organic' as one would expect. The atmosphere is so relaxed the place was crawling with kids, which again, should be expected - at least for lunch. The decor is again attractive but casual. Some tables even have foldable directors chairs to sit it. It certainly isn't over-air-conditioned...The ingredients are super fresh. The pea soup was ridiculously green and vibrant. It was probably the best of our three items. DH's pasta with beef was way oversalted. I tried one piece of the pasta alone and it was obvious. My fish was over a bed of barley with a pool of red glistening sauce beside it. My first observation was that the barley was black. I had to question the server about what was under my fish it looked so outlandish. It looked like it had been cooked with squid ink. It tasted fine - was actually quite savory. But I shouldn't have to shut my eyes to eat the food. The glistening bright red sauce next to the fish looked like an anatomical drawing of a heart. It was very off-putting. DH tried the goo and could not tell what it was, nor did he recommend it. The fish was also overcooked. It's not that the food was bad - but it wasn't great. The presentation was not good. I get the impression they were trying to do something 'different' and 'special'. I think they lost sight that it still has to look edible and appetizing. Not just weird. I'd prolly go there again. But maybe try something more 'normal' - like brunch or breakfast. Maybe pancakes or oatmeal. Something hard to over-complicate...The service was quick but not very friendly. And we were never even offered re-fills on our water (I was really thirsty from all the salt)
4
We really enjoyed our brunch experience in OFC. Feels nice to dine in an open Farm/garden setting. Our baby had his first experience playing in the herb gardens and feeding roosters. A great place for brunch for a family. Food wise, we really liked the fish burger. Rib eye was a bit smal. Dessert is creative in presentation and flavors but could be less sweet.Overall a nice and unique experience there! Will come back again!

It was my first time eating at the restaurant. I'm a bit ambivalent on the rating. My friend and I shared a starter which was the Roasted King Prawns. They were delicious and succulent. Then came the mains. My friend had the Mud Crab Pappardello and he commented it was really good and would bring his wife to the restaurant the next time. My Roasted Red Snapper on the other hand was too overcooked and dry and the skin was charred and burnt. The wine weren't cheap as well. So it was a score of 2-2 (2 good dishes but 1 wasn't and wine was expensive). But what tipped the scales was the greenery and the ambience. That is why I gave it a Very Good ratin

Great food but service is sub-par. Waited to be seated for a long time and service crew just walked past because it was not their job obviously. The host seemed more busy clearing tables than welcoming guests. Everyone looked like they had to drag their feet to work!

It is a very friendly and cozy restaurant in a private garden next to the Orchard area, very easy to find. They have an indoor and an outdoor area surrounded by vegetables and trees with fruits. The food was quite good, and the service was very nice. They even have a place for playing European ball game named "boules". We arrived a bit earlier in the evening. Playing the game with a beer was so fun after a very busy day during the week. We are totally 5 people. Everyone had 2 glasses of beer, one starter, and one main course. The final price is around SGD 400++

Visited this restaurant for a late brunch with friends - 4 adults to do our part to support green energy, healthy lifestyles and sustainable living and eco food choices. All good so far. The restaurant is set up in an interesting way with little garden plots around the area of the actual restaurant plus little stalls on the property selling all sorts of things, food and plants for decoration and natural supplements, etc. There is a sculpture garden also and it's fun for kids to run around, look at the different herbs and spices growing everywhere and to enjoy the smells and touch of the organic garden (no pesticides or chemical fertilisers here). The booking is very easy, done on-line and quite straight forward. You get an email confirming the booking and then a reminder closer to the day just to let you know that they have a 15 minute window around your booking time, no show and lose your spot. Fair enough. They are booked up days and weeks in advance for popular times so make sure you book. Just showing up won't be a good idea. When we arrived at about 2:30pm, we were going to park in the car park on site as we could see it had about 6 spaces left but there was a gate across it so you couldn't go in (this was opened later) so we had to park way up the street in the larger car park up and over the hill. Fortunately it wasn't raining, so not a problem and we had a couple of minutes to look around the garden and to also see some of the market garden type stalls that are set up in the property. There are chairs and table set around the open areas and it seems picnic style seating is encouraged as a few families were enjoying a sit down on a rug type of picnic like you would do at the botanical gardens or a park - nice actually. The stalls had interesting things like fresh oysters from an organic oyster farm - shucked in front of you, quite good value at 3 fo S$10. There was a BBQ cooking various healthy options and a smoothie stand making custom fruit and veggie mixed juices. There is a definite bohemian feel about the place but quite comfortable - until it rains, which it did. There is very little to no shelter from the rain. So, when you get a healthy Singapore downpour, you get very friendly with everyone else hiding under eaves and anywhere there is respite. They have a cafe type of shop where you can buy cafe type fare and this is separate from the restaurant. The restaurant is relaxing and comfortable. The door keeper checking reservations and letting you in or sending you away is a bit unwelcoming but once through the ogre at the gate, it's not so bad. I have to say, the reservation time was kept to, so no complaints about being on time. Our waitress was great, took the starter and main plus drinks order for all 4 of us, all memorised and no errors. Starters came quite quickly, mains were another issue. 2 mains came for my friends, my main came about 20 minutes later - after asking - the last main didn't come at all. A waiter (different one) came over to say the fish was still frozen (???) so please choose something else - this was 30 minutes after ordering - so we just cancelled it as the other 3 had almost finished. Unfortunate as the food was very good, just the delivery was not so good. We had coffees and that was given free as a gesture. Ambiance of the place is friendly, they have outside (under cover still) and inside and child friendly. I recommend it for the food. Prices are OK, it's different and a nice place to just stroll around, sample some other things while waiting for your reservation or to enjoy after your meal

nice nature setting but food is expensive with limited choice
the wait for the food took a while
parking is limited
5
Not our first time there. The pasta is really good and the ambience there is awesome. The fish that we ordered for the night was abit bland though.
4
Very fresh ingredients that you can feel the worthness and the efforts in the buzzy open kitchen! See ya'll soon again:D
5
Had the pasta there and it was so delicious! Deep and fragrant sauces <3 Loved the mini farm too, and the rooster walking about haha

I visited OFC with my Wife and three children aged 9, 7 and 4 months. We arrived to a scene of complete chaos with crowds of people blocking the cafe and restaurant because of the Farmers market that appears on the last weekend of each month. Despite the challenge of pushing my sleeping daughter's buggy through the crowds to the restaurant we were enjoying the melee and excited to discover the delights on offer that we'd heard so much about.We were escorted to our table immediately and seated. We were then advised that food was taking 30 minutes to leave the kitchen. No problem. Not put off we sat down and began to choose from an interesting and varied menu. The staff were friendly and accommodating and were good with the children. They even made the effort to prioritise the kids orders and sure enough my daughter was served a delicious Caesar salad within 15 minutes. My Wife had to remind the waiter about our wine which arrived shortly after. Sadly for us that was where the fun curiosity ended and the stress began. 30 minutes came and went with no sign of our food order. My aforementioned sleeping 4 month old daughter, done with her slumber, awakes to a noisy bustling restaurant and promptly decides this is not the place for her. 60 minutes comes and goes and we are increasingly restless with 3 fidgety children and still no sign of lunch. It's now 3pm. Our waiter tells us 5-10 minutes for our food. We wait patiently. 5 minutes passes and I ask to speak to the manager who is very apologetic and speaks to the kitchen. "10 minutes" we're told and we will take some money off your bill.Some bowls of chocolate ice cream appeared for the children as if by magic but our mains orders still nowhere to be seen.15 minutes later the manager reappears at our table hands full of bowls of scrumptious looking Scotch Eggs, (one of the dishes we had ordered) to tell us that these were not our Scotch eggs and that our food would be along imminently, 'it is just being plated up', we were told. The food she was holding was presented to a table who arrived at least 20 minutes after us. We had been watching plates and plates pass us by on all sides for the last 30 minutes. Many tables that had arrived after us were being served before us and by this stage an irate baby was in need of a feed of her own. Enough was enough and we called it a day. The restaurant graciously waived the entire bill but sadly that is little recompense for a ruined Sunday lunch.

I experienced very bad service from the front of house manager today (3 March 2017). My friend and I had arrived before opening hours (12pm) and waited first in line to check whether any tables were available once the restaurant opened. Behind us were a group of other guests who also did not have any reservations, they were Caucasians. When the front of house manager (also a Caucasian) arrived, we were ignored even though we were standing at the head of the queue. Instead of serving us first, she immediately attended to the group behind us, assuring them that they would be given a table for 4 even without reservation. I wonder why, perhaps we didn't have the correct skin colour. Such behaviour is surprising for a restaurant we thought would have properly trained their senior staff to make their guests to feel welcome and appreciated. Instead, we were made to feel like we were not good enough to be served. My friends and I have dined at your restaurant before and in the past, I did not encounter such appalling service. Did not eat there today and never coming back

Being a chef, one benefit of my job on a ship is that I get to explore new places and the cuisines of that area. This is my third trip to Singapore. I've eaten at Hawker Chan's (Michelin Star) and the top rated places as well as food centers and restaurants off the beaten path. This was by far the best meal experience I've had in Singapore. The setting was great, lots of plants, a garden, an orchard and art. The service was excellent and the food was fantastic. Combinations that were interesting yet accessible. I'm not a fan of that gastronimique that I can't pronounce and need a degree in chemistry to decipher. This was fusion at it's best without going overboard. It hellps that they source as much as they can locally and support local farmers. I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone
5
Service here is superb, was here on Valentine's day and attention to detail both by service staff and chef was great! Especially since it was full house, I enjoyed myself thoroughly.Prolly the fifth time here, and if i've anything to complain, it would be that the menu didn't change that much, which could possibly get boring with time if we visit so frequently.
3
Ambience is lovely (we sat indoors) however menu selection is not as extensive as expected and for the quantity and quality of the food, it seemed overpriced and overrated. I've heard good stuff about this place but when the food arrived, it was a disappointment. Mud crab curry pappardelle for $31++ with a few mere pieces of crab. My dining partner ordered a red snapper burger (approx $30++) which came with a side of fries and he commented that it was just a fancier version of MacDonald's fillet-o-fish. Probably won't be heading back anytime soon
5
How refreshing is it to eat amidst all that green, flowers, the roosters and the bees and remember that it sits smack bang in the middle of all the hustle and bustle that is Singapore. Loved the fare be it the fresh juices, soups or the salads.This open farm concept is to be enjoyed and appreciated
3
The title said it all.
Food ingredients were fresh and execution was immaculate. Comfortable and lovely interior decor, not trying too hard.
Too bad the set menu took 2-3 hours to be dished out.
5
Ambience and surrounding always reminds me of the wineries at Mornington Peninsular, Melbourne. Food is awesome. Very clean and crisp flavours. Unpretentious food that tastes out of this world. Thumbs up to the staff and management for the great work!
4
The ingredient is fresh, creative dishes, great presentation and most important of all the food taste awesome!! Very relaxed ambient and feel warm and welcomed. Friendly staff too.
5
We came here for dinner and it was such a wonderful experience. The food was so good. Delicious and well presented.
I also absolutely loved the ambience. It was very pretty and definitely not noisy as some others have pointed out.
5
Nice atmosphere with very friendly and attentive staff. Food is creative. Portion is really big so do share if you have a small appetite.
4
Watercress soup is a bomb. Laksa barramundi is not bad but slightly salty. Kids menu and lamb shank is so so..
4
The place was very nice! The only complain I have was that there wasn't much food varieties. Overall good experience though!
4
Visited for lunch on Friday. We tried the set lunch menus. Really fantastic tastes from simple ingredients. Busy time, so service was a bit slow but food did not disappoint.
3
I love the food here. However get real with some of the prices. We ordered a side of bread. It arrived. It was one pita bread cut upIn 4 pieces. Toasted. Nothing else. No olive oil salt or pepper. One slice toasted $6 SGD. That's a bit cheeky.

A group of us came with children at around 1pm on a weekday and we were surprised at how packed the place was. The parking lot was full and we had to park around the corner, at Jim Thompson. Thanks to the bad acoustics, and the restaurant being crowded, the at-times overly loud vocal contributions from some of the kids were not noticeable. So, pretty kid-friendly :)With big glass windows overlooking the garden, fairy lights overhead, and little vases of wild flowers on each table, the decor was fresh and laid-back. The service was rather cold and stiff, though, noticeably from the server not wearing a uniform (the head waitress?), with each request--for things like ordering and water refills--met with a rather dour face. Maybe she wasn't feeling well that day. A warning: The food portions are really huge here, even stuff from the "little diners" menu. Three adults shared one "little diners" salad (it was not little), one appetizer, and two main courses, and I was struggling to make a dent in the last two items. One of our children ordered the fish pie from the kids' menu and I'd say it could easily have fed an adult. Two of the dishes we ordered suffered from overseasoning: the steak tartare and the Barolo braised oxtail strozzapreti. While both were tasty, the latter was so salty, I almost couldn't eat it. And if you Google image search "strozzapreti" (which is what I had to do--heh), that isn't what we got; our dish looked just like regular fusilli, which was disappointing. If they ran out of strozzapreti, they should have let us know when taking our order. If they're just serving fusilli and trying to call it a different name.... The fish pie was good, subtly flavored but with a nice hint of thyme. The dressing for the caesar salad looked like it had been painted onto the plate with a huge brush in one curved stroke--a nice touch. The steak tartare had the most gorgeous fresh raw yolk perched on top of the rectangle of tartare, with bright green blobs of cilantro puree dotting the plate. The braised oxtail was the least appealing item we ordered, with large clumps of mushy-stringy oxtail tossed with fusilli and a syrupy Barolo sauce. The Saffron carnaroli risotto was my favorite dish--so beautiful and delicious. The yellow rice was broken up with bright splashes of indigo blue Butterfly Pea(?) blossoms, crisp disks of Serrano (so good), tiny green peas, and a drizzle of some blueberry-colored reduction. Again, very strong flavors, but managed not to go over the edge. I gave Open Farm Community only three stars because, for the price we paid, I felt we shouldn't have had any dish that was verging on inedible. The staff seemed overworked (hence the tired faces and lack of service), and I feel that at any restaurant, let alone a good one, you shouldn't have to ask multiple times to have your waters topped up). This is a nice place for a leisurely lunch, though, and I would be tempted to come again. But I think with its gorgeous gardens that can only be enjoyed in the daytime, it is such a shame that they limit their weekend menu to brunch items only. For people with kids, the outdoor seating area for their cafe is really spacious and bracketed by big fans, so it looked like a nice place to sit back with a coffee, while your children play in the sandpit nearby or explore the gardens and the resident rooster
3
Food was great, quality is certainly there. But the condiments were too saltly, portion on the small side given the price tag. A vegetable side for $17++?
4
We really enjoyed the pasta and the salad. Exquisite tastes. The mains were a bit dull. Was expecting more from the lamb and the fish. All in all a quality dining experience.
5
We came during the non-peak hours on a weekday. Ambience was lovely, and the food that we had was yummy!
5
I have eaten here at least twice and it is well above the rest of Dempsey hill. Great ambiance and atmosphere. Food and service are great and so nice in Singapore to experience outdoor dining in a garden.
4
This is one of my favorite places, it's a tad expensive but totally worth it, food is really good and so is the ambience!
5
Great clean food, lovely setting and love the fact that you can order anything and know it's real food. Would be good to see a little more options on menu. Otherwise fantastic.
Recommend and would definitely go again.
Must book

This was the first time I have been to this place and was really surprised we haven't been before. The place was a hive of activity in the kitchen and the restaurant is very popular so book ahead at least a couple of days. We had a group of 12 and wanted to expand to 14 but they were completely booked out. It has a drinks garden (Open Door Policy - 100% gluten and dairy-free) out the front which has amazing coffee and juice options. We arrived a little early so they served coffee and juices to us in the garden area. This would be a great get away from Orchard Rd as it is so close and a real escape.I had the spinach gnocchi off the alacarte menu and it was very nice. A little of the big plate average servings approach to the food so expect a couple of courses, of either entre followed by main or a desert in this place if you want to walk out full. Others had a the awesome looking fish burger and fries which looked really good, but I am vegetarian so wouldn't go down that path. I will definitely be back another time for a nice romantic dinner with my wife one night as it has a very cosy type interior (I could image at night with the fairy lights). Open kitchen means you can see the food getting cooked and plated. Loads of staff to wait tables
3
The farm ambience was fantastic. Surrounded by greenery, if you prefer the fresh air and heat, you can sit outside. Otherwise, we can choose indoors.Just didn't find the menu interesting. Had the caesar salad ...simple but there were surprises. The baked cheese was added to thesalad. Very delicious
5
We really liked the vibe and food at OFC. While waiting for food we went around the gardens for a walk, it was really therapeutic.In terms of improvement, OFC could consider serving the food only when guests return to our table. We took awhile longer than expected at the gardens and when we returned the waiters told us the food's been on our table for awhile. Food was still warm thankfully
5
The dishes were very innovative , not your typical mains or pastas. You can feel lots of thought and effort were put into the menu and ingredients chosen. Enjoyed the farm to table concept and the big open space. Service was also impeccable with friendly servers
2
Food is pretty but expensive and not worth a return. My friends didn't enjoy their meals at all. Some had stomach ache
2
It took the restaurant 30min to serve our lunch. The herb garden setting is messy and disorganized. Food served is average and not worth the price we pay
5
We came with no high expectation and left 110% satisfied with the food and our experience.The food is absolutely amazing here! we had warm the broccoli salad and the roasted king prawn to start; the marinated it comes with was delicious. For main course we had the laksa barramundi and the roasted red snapper, my mouth is still watering thinking about it, absolutely phenomenal!. The service was awesome thanks to our Latino American server Alejandro, the food exceptional and the wine and cocktails were perfect. It's on the expensive side of course because fine dining like this is rare! Thanks to Cheff Russell, and the team for a memorable night!Cannot wait to return! Value for money too.Thanks for a great night

Dinner gathering spoilt by the thunderstorm and the rigid 2 hr seating time restriction. It was pouring when we arrived and some of us had to drive out to ferry those who are caught in the rain. A couple braved the rain and dashed from the carpark to the restaurant only to be greeted sarcastically by the staff "you made it!!" instead of offering napkin/tissue to them. A good 30 min wasted to get everyone dry and ready for dinner.. food was good and beautifully presented though. The huge turn off came when the staff told us that they need the table back in 15 min when most of us are only half way through their meals. There was no notice of such policy on their website or when we made the reservation while the staff insisted that its written in the email notification. There were other tables who were there before us but apparently the 2hr restriction does not apply to them as they are walk in customers. Time to get your policy and staff training right.
5
The is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. Very suitable for the families with kids. They have a little playground with sands and farm areas with chicken. The organic food are very health. My son loves their pasta, who can easily eat the entire bowl. He is only 2. Great place for family reunion and friends meal with kids.
5
I would say Open Farm Community is its first of its kind in Singapore. No one can expect from a flat land it could become a gem in the iconic town area. The food was unexpected, the Chef keep it simple, rustic and most importantly lots of explosion of flavours lingering your palate. Using 95% local source and garden herbs for the finishing touch elivate a different after taste.Service was prompt and staff were knowledgable about thier product. If you want to try organic,natural or bio dynamic wines this is the place
5
I come here every month for the lovely food and vibe and tend to invariably eat the same dishes. Smoked haddock omelette, crab curry pasta, blue cheese and mushroom rigatoni and basil lemon tart. Not cheap, but first-class delectable morsels. I eat the same things so often because they're such a beautiful delight (the textures, the flavours) in this mouth but it's starting to get a tad BO-RING. So how about it, Open Farm Community, time to get super re-inspired before your loyal customers get the itch in their feet to flee?

This place is quite something. We went there on a Sunday evening, it was raining cats and dogs, but when we made it past the greenery and the shop into the restaurant proper, we suddenly felt very much like at the heart of Europe - only without the 13h long flight. It reminded us instantly of our favourite place is London (Bistrotheque). The decor is simple and unpretentious, with a greenhouse twist: high ceiling, wooden tables, metal chairs, bunch of garden herbs and flowers in a jar, discrete light, talks and laughs around. It's an open space really, but it's inviting and relaxing - just perfect for a dinner or a brunch with the loved ones.And now to the food. One would expect simple dishes with a rustic note, but the Chef really takes it to the next level. Expect finely mixed tastes, with subtlety and elegance worthy of the best. We went for the watercress soup, the short rib, and the coconut laksa barramundi, and all were exquisite. Plus the cheese platter for the connoisseurs, and the spiced pumpkin cake that was still on my taste buds a week later. The selection of wines is also fine, with a very good pale rose of Provence, and a feisty Austrian red to match the short rib.Last but not least - the staff are very attentive and helpful, and can make good food & wine recommendations. We would like to thank them for the wonderful evening we had. A strong candidate for Singapore favourite, we will be back in no time

I have been to the sister restaurant (Open Door Policy) before and really enjoyed that so I had high expectations for this restaurant. I was not disappointed. You should check them out and I recommend reviewing the menu online ahead of time to help you make decisions when you get there. Some mouth-watering options. We were there for dinner but I have had friends tell me that their brunch is great

Am glad for places like Open Farm Community who transport you into a different place when you walk through their doors. We landed on a week day for lunch. (If you don't like crowds, avoid this place on the weekend)It was my idea of a good getaway. Not too crowded so you can hear yourself talk and staff can take more time with you. Hip and mod while creating a charming green ambience (I recognize many different plants used for cooking in the garden)Good place for a relaxing lunch. Good for entertaining small groups of friends. We had the corn and basil soup served with bits of charred corn (it was smokey, it was divine), vegetarian pasta with pesto and a Cesar salad (I love salads but this was not a good combo. Dressing just too heavy and overall, uninspiring and unappetizing). My friend enjoy her homemade pasta. The served plate was so pretty. Am glad it tasted equally good.Service staff were excellent. We were happy to learn about the food, the one year old eatery, the table deco freshly picked from the gardens.
5
This place is great. Fantastic for lunch. Food is delicious and beautifully presented. Amazing imagination with the food. Never what you expect. Service is excellent and wine selection good. Another fantastic place for Ryan Cliff. 👍👍

Gnocchi + Lime tart with basil ice-cream, Love it! A good place for dinner after a nice walk in Botanic Gardens :)
3
Went with a group of friends to celebrate birthday. The ambience is great and the restaurant is spacious and well decorated. Most importantly, support local produced!
3
Visit Open farm community for brunch.Tried frog, cafe, chicken burger, dessert etc.Very popular restaurant cloudy and bit noisy.Because of many customers feel waiters give pressure to oder or go out.So we ordered too much as we want.They mis-order I ordered ice latte but brought hot latte.Food is so so not special.Price is too much.One person $80.I think if pay $80 for breakfast may be next time go hotel buffet
4
Loved the ambiance, great concept. A very relaxing place to start the weekend. A little hard to locate since the signage is not too big, and if you are not familiar with the place, google maps is also not very useful. I suggest you go with a friend whose been there before or take a cab. I went there for brunch with friends and ordered pancakes and long black coffee. Presentation of food is superb, my pancakes were yummy but my friend's order did not turn out as good as he hoped for. As in any restaurant, the food will be a matter of personal taste. For me personally, I will go back and visit again for brunch
3
I had high hopes for Open Farm Community. The car park normally is pretty crowded so it looked popular. Being a farm I expected the natural fresh ingredients to shine through. They looked very pretty. Unfortunately the dishes were too rich and flavours didn't go well. We went on a Saturday morning and sat on the chef's table. We had the 63 degree egg with beef. The beef was fine but didn't go with the ricotta. We also had the Mud crab pasta with Thai sauce. The sauce was too thick and spicy so the pasta was gluggy. There also wasn't much crab. It wasn't nice. Sorry but won't be back.
5
Have heard about the open farm community for a long time but have never made it there til now.We were a big group with 6 adults and 4 kids and everyone loved the atmosphere and the food. The kids absolutely loved exploring the gardens and lawn bowling. Food prices are not very cheap but the portions were big. We brought a cake to celebrate a birthday and had to order 3 desserts so that we will not incur charges for bringing outside food
4
The beef short rib which I had for my main was quite decent but did not come with much else (the "noodles" were non-existent). However, the crispy frog legs & warm salad which we had for starters and the caramelised mango & lemon tart which we had for desserts were really well presented and flavoursome.
4
Love the idea and the setting, the food is excellent and the wine list is interesting and well-priced. The smoked haddock omelette is a super starter, though very big and rich; probably good to share. By contrast, my frogs legs were a tiny starter - little more than a mouthful. Hail Caesar salad a bit heavy on mayonnaise. For mains we had the chicken Katsu burger, the grouper and a pasta. All well received. Service is friendly and well organised. Not a cheap dinner, but worth trying.
3
This restaurant is well positioned in a time when hunting and gathering on home ground are buzz words in the F&B industry. Unfortunately though the food didn't live up to the promise. I am not saying it was bad or anything but it wasn't what was promised, from a marketing perspective. The interior and outside spaces are well put together and convey a sense of haphazard chic casualness. The menu is full of fancy language and promises of the best ingredients but the output, the food is "just food". A bit of European and Asian ingredients and flavours make this restaurant just one of many overpriced fusion "hotspots". We were also told that we had to vacate our seat after a certain hour to make way for other guests, leaving us (8 guests) just not enough time to enjoy an evening out
5
Very tasty food and very friendly staff!
Amazing what they can do with veggies!
Playground area outside is just great!
Went there in the evening so didn't get the chance to see what they are growing.
A must go and a must try in Singapore!
3
this place is fine for a family lunch but not so outstanding as to live up to the hype. food ranged from great to so so, service was ok, prices reasonable, setting and acoustics bad, nothing great, pretty average really.....
5
I had the corn soup to start and the grouper entree - both were fantastic. I recommend trying the wine flight (I had the white and my husband had the red). Service was very good and the ambience was lovely.
3
Very ordinary Ragatoni - Soggy Kale on ciabatta , the community farm is a outing for rich family only
The deserts were good but an expensive proposition- looks great with a watered down food quality
5
Lunch with the local set is arwsome. Truly supporting local produce and fresh herbs from thier garden to brings the melody in the food they serve. Fresh,vibrant and explosion of flavors i would describe my meal. Attention to detail service compliments the whole dining experience to another level. Well done Open Farm Communit
5
Tuck in a coroner of Singapore where the landscape is filled with greenery and budding flowers. This restaurant even has its own farm with vege patch and free roaming chickens. The food is simply outstanding. Taste explodes in your mouth and the memory of it lingers on. Orders the set menu, 4 course and shared it with my wife. Told them it was her birthday and they took the effort to stick the candle on our dessert plate. Love the attention to detail and fabulous service. Thank you.

Been awhile since a few of us wanted to try this place, after hearing and reading mad reviews about this place, we finally managed to eat there and were we stoked!! This is seemed to be pet friendly so that's a major plus! On top of that, walking towards the cafe, would really give you a nice, not your usual Singapore brunch vibe! Because the place is bustling with pop up stores, selling really awesome stuff, will definitely go back to try more! Best thing for me is, they are mostly local businesses and that they didn't try to hard to sell you stuff! On to talking about the cafe/restaurant proper! Hah! I've gotta start of with the service staff! If I could I would give them each a gold star!! The waiters that served us were really friendly! Super attentive! Annnnnd they took notice of who ordered, what! This one guy, for the life of me I can't spell his name (I'm so sorry!) he takes the cake, he knows the menu well! The dessert he recommended plus the main! Got us all salivating for more!! Oh yes, I forgot to mention, the menu differs with the serviceTry their, caramelised mango and lemon tart also their compressed watermelon disc! For mains try their lamb scotch egg, chicken katsu burger!!! Also the 48 hour Barlo braised oxtail pasta! Must!! It was and definitely made our day! The birthday girl was also very happy to have eaten there! Safe to say, we most likely will come back for other stuff on the menu and to enjoy the good vibes!! Would bring my dog out the next time too! Thanks for taking time to read my reviewPeace!

Was told about this place as a possible venue for a private garden party for 100pax and really wanted to try it out. Location is central. The surroundings could be better kept in a good condition. What really surprised us was the price of food - hotel prices - although the taste of the meals was pretty good. I had the mud crab pasta which was delicious but the portion was really pathetic for $29. My friends had the caesar salad and the chicken burger. Salad was good. The chicken in the burger was burnt in some parts but we ate it up anyway cos we are paying so much. Not going to hold my party there
3
Good concept. Went for Sunday lunch with friends. Had the basil soup, which was nice and the salmon crepe, which had a very strange green dressing which was not so nice. We all shared a bottle of rose bubbles. I noticed that the waiter took our bottle away and did not return despite there being at least another 2 glasses left in it. I did not mention it as I didnt want to spoil our lunch with a row.In total our table had 2 starters, 4 (small) mains, 2 (small) desserts, 1 wine, 4 teas and the bill was nearly $400. I nearly fainted.Not worth the money by a long chalk

I don't normally do restaurant reviews but this place is worth highlighting. It is set up not far from the Dempsey area of shops and restaurants, and can be a little tricky to find. It combines an indoor and outdoor restaurant, a shop, some gardens (where the produce is grown) and a lawn bowling area - don't be expecting pristine bowling grass, but it's fun.A welcome and heavy emphasis on the organic, which makes it expensive, but the food is very good indeed - better than I was expecting, in fact. Between us we tried lamb shank, grouper, barramundi and a mud crab pappardelle, and nobody was disappointed. Very tasty, flavoursome, and well presented. Meanwhile my son made friends with the local chickens. The organic wine was decent too.I get that people object to the price, but to me, it was worth it, with helpful and polite service too

Love it's connection to nature and outdoor casual vibes. The simple meal of smoothie and sandwich I had was at best mediocre. Waitress open bickering and clearly lacking training. Quite a pity that food and service is not a par with what nature has provided
4
Celebrated a farewell lunch for a colleague. Interesting with a gift shop, playground and open bar. Food is fusion in style and service is fast.
4
My friend brought me here, this is my first experience here. This place is quite fun where there are plants, fish pond, table tennis table for short game.
Great place and nice coffee for family or friends to chit chat.
5
Its a great place for children. I love it. The food is excellent. So is the service. You should definitely go if you are in Singapore.

Had heard about how amazing this place was and was warned that it was expensive. Only the 2nd part proved right. Quite disappointed. Very limited menu, extremely small portions and pathetic service. Definitely not value for money. Only time I came out hungry after a lunch and after paying quite a bit. Would definitely not go again

Better when they first opened. We recently returned and vowed it would be our last visit. At first, despite the extremely noisy interior, we enjoyed the menu, especially items such as the barramundi and the chocolate dessert. The service was excellent and way above average for Singapore. Recently there have been cutbacks on the menu, staff who have no product knowledge and don't really know what they are doing and the noise problem hasn't been addressed. When Singapore has so many f and b choices, it's hard to understand why they have gone for lower quality all around

Fresh local produce. Great ambience with farm view. Arwsome cocktails and of cox FOOD n SERVICE. Food to try from starter Warm Salad of Brocoli/Coal baked omellete with smoke haddock, pasta Oxtail strozzapreti/mud crab pappadelle with thai curry/main course Barramundi woth laksa sauce/lamb shank with coucous and end with a dessert Lemon tart woth homemade basil ice cream/charred watermelon disc with mexican terragon ice cream..yummy!!
4
Nice and casual environment. The interior is a bit loud due to all glass windows and concrete floor. Can be unpleasant. Healthy food, diverse menu but must choose correctly. Starters, the watercress soup with poached egg is highly recommended, caeser salad is very good. Skip the frog leg. For main course, Lamb shank and oxtail pasta are good. Pork ribs is a real disappointment. Desert lemon tart should give it a miss. Grilled Mango pudding can be a winner. The organic wine list is quite limited. Should allow BYOB.

Close to the botanical garden, the restaurant Open Farm Community has been set up within a pfarm and uses products grown on site as well as local products. You can eat outside or inside and the quality is here with good and tasty products and creative recipees. A nice experienc
5
Visited on a Saturday lunchtime.This is a very cool place close to the heart of Singapore. The setting takes you away from Singapore and is very down to earth and natural. The food in the restaurant is amazing.....the warm broccoli salad is a must !A very cool place wether you are visiting or just looking for great food.One of the best food experiences in the world 
4
We walked around the outdoor compound, nice and pleasant walk near sunset. Let the photos speak here.
We didn't do the restauranting here.
Come with a good eco friendly mosquitoes repellent . 3 out of 5 of us, had bites. .....
4
Food was quite good! Loved the caesar salad, probably the best I have ever had! Overall, loved the feel of the place and definitely worth a visit!
4
I love coming here in a sunday afternoon. Such a chill atmosphere.
Good coffee. They hoat a farmers market on certain weekends that adds to the atmosphere with music and even ping pong tables to play at.
A must visit!
5
Great place with great real food. Tasty healthy and really good portions.
They have a restaurant (need to book most of the time) and a cafe section out the front.
Kids area to play outside also which is great
Highly recommend.
5
A big group of us went for a friends birthday lunch. Absolutely delicious food (the lamb literally melted off the bone!), first class service and lovely wine made it a perfect venue! Would definitely recommend. Will be back!
5
Lovely fresh ingredients--I'm vegetarian and although my choices were limited the food I did have was excellent. Great service as well and a lovely atmosphere---a bit noisy but not a problem.
5
I have been to Open Farm Community when it first opened and loved it, although completely forgetting to write a review. However recently I attended a small function at OFC and again I was blown away by the attentive staff, waiting on our group. Nothing was too much trouble and their professionalism was on point. Our group had a set menu, all of the options sounded mouthwatering. The pear, blue cheese and arugula salad was tasty. For the main, I went outside my comfort zone and order the asian style spare ribs, and they were delicious. Not to mention dessert, with the basil ice-cream and lemon tart. Such a game changer, so unique in its taste and presented beautifully.The freshness, the flavours, colours and presentation all made for such an amazing dining experience. Definitely one to visit on your travels or when your looking to impress
4
Had a nice dinner here with my wife. Original non Asian dishes with very interesting and refreshing combinations. Attentive and knowledgeable service which actually has a "can" instead of "cannot" attitude. Dishes are appropriately sized and while possibly a limited menu, due to the seasonality of the items this seemed logical to us (still at least a meat dish and veggie dish). Great ambiance, very nice location, good food and attentive service; would come back 
5
We had read about this new restaurant and vegetable garden in Singapore and were determined to try it and we were so glad we did. We were able to sit outside for dinner and there was a lovely atmosphere with some family groups on a balmy evening. We understand there is an even better atmosphere and vibe for lunch on weekends, and we could well believe it. Everything we ate we loved,with plenty of fresh picked vegies and herbs, and they even found a bottle of wine that we liked very much that was not on the list. Service was friendly and efficient. It is not an easy place to find, and so if you have a taxi or driver make sure they approach Minden Road via Napier and Holland Rds
4
Very nice food. Small portion, but beautiful like a piece of art, stylish...The price is upper range in Singapore. 2 Person lunch you got to prepare 100S$ +. When you pay for the bill, you realize 15% service fee and 7% goods & services tax have to be on the top. That is, the price in the menu is not the final price. You got to caculate the service and tax on top
5
Fantastic lunch, presentstion, food, flavour, staff all were fantastic.Crispy fried Jurong frogs legs, Sour sheeps cheese. Beetroot fregola pasta, was a beautiful dish.!!
Mud crab papardelle thai red curry worked well and was great..
Lemon tart w basil ice cream "stunning ?!"
4
It is worth a visit, great healthy food and excellent coffee. An excellent Vision of the Founder, well executed to the T. Need more of this for Healthy & Happy Living.
5
Amazing tasty food in a great setting with a relaxed vibe. Ideal for couples, and groups of people alike. Hard to get a reservation though so make sure you book in advance! Such great quality ingredients, so fresh each flavour really stands out. In a group of 6 people not one person had a bad starter, main or desert. Super happy bunch of people, although you do pay a lot for the privilege

Food is good here. The warm salads are seasoned beautifully and pastas done right - al dente. Dinner here can be quite pricey but justifiable for the quality of produce they use. However, if it ain't a cheap dinner, I expect the service to be decent. I was there with my family last Sunday and it was so hard to get a wait staffs' attention. From asking for extra napkins (because we spilled some water on the table), to asking for the bill. They acknowledge our request but seem to forget it once they walk away from our table. Everything had to be requested for twice or more. I think I'm better off serving myself.Also, just a heads up, they have a 'cakeage' - $35 if you want to cut your birthday cake in the restaurant
5
We booked a table for 2 today and didn't realise that we had to specify that we wanted a table outside since our Chihuahua was with us. Even amid the mothers' day rush, the reservations staff sorted the issue out quickly and we were seated right away.I had the mud crab pappardelle with Thai curry sauce pasta and I couldn't have been more pleased with my choice. It was an interesting Thai-Italian fusion of flavours and the shelled crabmeat was very fresh. This is definitely something I'd order again.Our waitress was attentive and brought a bowl of water for our dog without us having to ask
3
I went with two friends for brunch and we were really pleased with the food we ordered. If you go, don't be surprised if your taxi driver is confused--it's tucked away in a beautiful little garden. Though, our waiter was a little rude. He questioned us when we asked for small plates to share our food, saying there wasn't space on the table. He also tried to hurry us out of the table, declining to bring us coffee as our reservation was "over in fifteen minutes." There were plenty of open tables around us and we were hardly there more than an hour.
4
We went over for the Sunday lunch and had a great time. The food tastes very fresh! The service was great and our server Alex made sure we had a great time. We proffered the the soup and salads over the mains. Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon

I've been to this restaurant 4 times now (the first time being in October 2015, the most recent in late April 2016), during lunchtime as well as dinner time. Loved it the first three times - the food was wonderful, melt in the mouth meats, divine desserts, friendly, upbeat service, and refreshing properly chilled white wine. I hosted my special friends to Open Farm Community to celebrate their special occasions. My expectations were high for the fourth visit, which was a let down - still good, but almost ordinary. I felt sad that the special friend whose birthday was being celebrated had to do with a less than excellent experience. The egg starter was less fluffy than before (I have had this three times now), the beef short rib was one third gristle and fat, and the not very cold white wine was served in a regular water glass, service was still friendly but a bit listless. The only consistent item was the lemon tart which tasted great as usual. Group size was not a variant - my group size is 3 to 4 people. I will probably still go back to Open Farm Community one more time to try to find the old magic. I hope things are not starting to slide. One indication that this might be a danger, apart from the matters mentioned above, is the now slightly overgrown and weedy farm plots which used to burst with freshness. I am giving this place 4 stars on balance (last visit being 3 or less). I hope my next visit will be a 5 star experience again

heard many good things about this place and was excited to visit the restaurant for brunch. we had the lamb and curry scotch egg which was absolutely horrible. there was an overwhelming taste of spice, no taste of lamb and it was absolutely dry. the egg within and the coleslaw was the only saving grace of that dish. we also had the fresh clams pasta which was average (though the home-made pasta was al dente and done right) and the haddock omelette. both of which was average tasting. nothing over the top wow. we had coffee which was a little light on flavor but decent. the ambience was lovely but service could have been better. when we were ready to take our orders, we heard a server yell "whoever is free, table 15 (or 5) wants to take order". okay noted on our table number. I guess this place delivers hit and misses. and it's pricey! 2 coffees, a pasta and an omelette added up to about 75$ :/

This restaurant is part of a farm and I understand the greens are from the farm . The salad is excellent ( my friends gobbled up all my snow peas), so tasty that I would venture here again just for it. I ordered fish as a main which was good and my friends had lamb which they told me was good too.The desert served too was good although I did not eat mine.Coffee was strong.The restaurant is surrounded by greenery which makes it piquant break for city dwellers jaded with built up skyscrapers.Only caveat: there is no set lunch/ dinner so you have to pay a la carte prices
5
Visited for lunch with a friend and the food was delicious. We shared the Wagyu burger and warm broccoli salad. Tge burger was
4
We had a wonderful experience here last weekend. The children loved the play area and the adults enjoyed table tennis and bowls. Food was very good, lots of choice on the menu and reasonably priced. It's a great concept, thoroughly enjoyable.
5
Arrived without booking and still got a place for 2 at a communal table with nice chairs on a sunday.On arrival the carpark had been taken over by homemade produce sellers. Then we arrived at a shop and began to wonder where the restaurant was, nearly turning around to leave.A nice surprise tucked in the back was the restaurant that served gorgeous watercress soup (S$19)and broccoli salad (S$20) with the best sugarsnap peas I've ever had. Wanting to be really healthy today we even got cauliflower that turned out to be a huge portion even for 2 sharing (S$17). Not complaining! it was also really tasty with the yogurt dressing. Even my partner who's anti-cauli was converted.I highly recommend this spot and will bring my friends next time.Homemade lemonade without the syrup was sadly a bit expensive at $12 per glass. If the lemons were home grown or organic then I wouldn't begrudge the price.Thanks you, for a healthy and filling meal.
4
Had the red snapper, smoked duck pasta and a kids lasagne. On individual rating basis - snapper was a 3 (slightly fishy for my taste), smoke duck pasta a 3.5 and kids lasagne a 4. The dessert were good. The mango coconut ice cream (4.5 stars) and roasted watermelon with ice-cream (4 stars) were good. There's a small little playground with a slide - Cow and pig shaped construction. Spray anti mosquitos lotion if you are going for dinner
5
We went for brunch and it was delicious. I had the lamb curry scotch egg with coleslaw and vegetables. It was wonderful, great curry flavor and the egg was cooked perfectly. My husband had the 65 degree egg with steak toast. He enjoyed every bite. The restaurant changes it menu everyday. They grow there own produce right on the site. W will be back for sure

My first experience of a local "farm to table" concept restaurant and judging from the difficulty getting through by phone to make a reservation (near impossible - you have to use the hungry go where app), this place is doing well. Have now had both lunch and dinner at OFC and both visits were on the whole very enjoyable though the food is probably an average rather than very good.What works is the comfortable light filed dining room and outdoor terrace. The entire site has a rustic feel right from the dirt track entry way, sandbox playground and unmanicured herb and vegetable garden. Tables are spaced comfortably apart with larger wooden tables available for larger parties. Service was friendly and attentive and, the food was served very promptly after we ordered on both visits. Now the food - some dishes like the grilled whole baby eggplant, baked barramundi and mud crab spaghettoni with Thai curry sauce were tasty and well executed. What didn't quite work for us was the baked pumpkin which if not for the pesto dressing it was served with, had no taste and the orange meringue pie that pretty much fell apart when we tried to cut it up for sharing (Mary Berry would not approve!). I also thought at S$18 per dish, dessert was overpriced.OFC is a welcome addition to the Dempsey dining cluster. It would even better once they work out improvements to some of their dishes
4
A charming "shack" of a restaurant - not easy to find especially at night (they could do with better and brighter signage). We ordered the Haloumi with basil salad, the Mud Crab Spaghettoni - wich came served with tagliatelle instead, the Red Grouper with peas and mint puree and the caramelized Mango with textures of coconut which was highly recommended by the service staff..All of the dishes delighted the palate and we finished each dish wanting more, well mainly because there was not much on the plate! The portions are relatively scant so I would advise you to definitely order the whole shebang - a starter, a main, pasta AND dessert. The Haloumi and Basil salad was a wonderfully yin yang combination and was definitely the right start to the meal. The Red Grouper was well presented and pan fried to perfection. The Mud Crab pasta was a delicate blend of flavours, devoured in five minutes. If you do NOT have a sweet tooth but still need a good finishing, the Mango with coconut dessert is ideal, being mellow and mildly rich. All in all a great meal

On a patch of scrubland near MFA lies this hidden gem. Farms in Singapore are scraggly things but they've made the best of it and an enticing community of outhouses (think re salvaged industrial chic) that house the cafe, grocery and restaurants emerges beyond the shrubs.Prices are higher here but we were happy to pay more given the farm-to-table promise. We had the clam pasta and mud crab pasta and the latter was the standout of the two. Huge hearty chunks of crab glistened in a Thai-inspired sauce that proved more satisfying than the 10-odd local clams on the citrus-based broth. Price differential: $2. Go for it; you're worth it! The thyme-based cocktail was a little meh (too bitter?) but the lemon layered flaky tart with basil ice cream hit all the right sweet spots with its spin on things. Highly recommended! With all the enticing smells emanating from the open kitchen, this place is worth a re-visit. Will check out the other dishes next time.
3
This is a wonderful concept and we went with high expectations on a saturday night which might have been the problem.It is a good setting but deafingly noisy in the main dining room( when will someone think about soaking up noise when it comes to restaurant design?) A friendly waiter got our order(very simple) wrong and one of first courses came twenty minutes after the other three as a result.The food choice on the menu reads well but fails to deliver on the plate.My clams were cold and had more empty shells than ones withclams in.Also the advertised"bread" was industrial pita which does not quite align with all the organic stuff they babble on about.The main courses were so-so and tepid at best.The mud crab pappardelle had three tiny flecks of something clearly meant to be mud crab but the thai curry sauce tasted as if it had come from a jar.The intention here is admirable and may well be a succss during the week.Otherwise it is no big deal
3
We went many times to Open Farm Community when it first opened and it was excellent (aside for the acoustics). Then it became impossible to book a table and perhaps the restaurant became a victim of its own success. The portions have shrunk...but the price point obviously hasn't. Bartender had no clue how to make an aperol spritz which was annoying as aperol is on the menu and the recipe is on the label! Service is very friendly though and the setting is great. But unlikely to go back..
2
Had a Friday dinner here. Seems that the fad for the place seems to have faded.. Not that impressed with how certain ingredients keep reappearing in different dishes (i.e blue pea flower and the pita bread)
5
Enjoyed my lunch at ofc. The food was great and service was ok. Will be back again for a lazy weekend. The wine on tap is great.
4
Book a table or be very disappointed. Small car park so be on time for your table. Be prepared for a long wait if it is busy. The food is worth waiting for and the staff are very helpful. Everything on the menu is available even if you are only going for brunch. Play area for the kids and you can walk through the home grown crops area, these are used in the food prepared and served to you
2
This had quite a lot of potential initially. On my first visit, I was impressed with the deco and space, as well as an unique and interesting menu. On my 2nd and 3rd visit in Jan 2016, the quality of food is just terrible. I do not recommend. Paying about $60 per person minimum for bad food, even in a nice environment, is not worth it still.
5
Located about 5 mins walk from Singapore Botanic Garden (Holland road's side). Nothing looks special from outside, but it is nice inside!Need reservations from their website, recommended to have it few days before especially if you wanna come on weekend. There's also limitation of time, about 1.5 hrs for brunch, and 2 hrs for lunch n dinner.They have some selections of seafood, meats even vegetarians foods. We had amazing Clams with bread as appetizers, vegetarians pasta and grilled fish for me (sorry don't remember the fancy names in the menu). The portions are not too big, but they are d**n gooood! Love the service from smiley waiters, warm welcome from the pretty front "officer", and they serve foods quiet fast too!
5
The food is excellent and fresh, quite creative in the association for products grown in the garden.Starter: fermented carrot tartare is quite nice.Pastas are served with good portion.Desserts are worth trying, especially lemon tart with basil ice cream or caramelized mango.Service is nice and polite. Plates arrive all at the same time (which is worth mentioning in Singapore).I will come back for brunch, there is a small kid play nearby
3
We were showed to our seat which was right by the entrance. We got a change but the staff didn't seem quite content about it. Staff were chatting amongst themselves while I was trying to get their attention. Food is rather overpriced. Do not stand outside at night, this place is a mosquito paradise (got bitten).It's nice that they served a free appetisers but I'm not sure if they are taking too long to make this and took quite awhile to serve the main courses
4
A novel concept in Singapore, this kitchen garden/dining establishment in Dempsey is a delight and well worth a visit especially if you're a fan of local, organic food and/or have a young family that needs some distraction. It has a decent parking area adjacent to the property which includes a coffee shop, a restaurant with a terrace as well as indoor seating, play areas for children, a lawn bowls green (artificial grass) and various spaces growing herbs, vegetables and fruits all in a limited terrain - plus some weird and wonderful sculptures and a marvellous setting. Any downside ? Probably the smoke stack from the neighbouring Jim Thompson eatery but, otherwise, no. The food ? Fresh, nicely presented ingredients with decent portion sizes. About 10% of the produce comes from the kitchen garden, and the aim is to source the rest from surrounding farmers if possible. Meat and fish is largely imported but come from sustainable producers. A similar approach is taken on the beverage side with a range of wines offered on tap (thereby both reducing the cost and the handling). Draft beers (lager and dark) come from Suntory. The wine list is limited (there is, alas, no cellar) but focuses on bio and organic vintners. Pricing is mid-range. Service is excellent and a lot of effort is obviously put into the human resource side of the business in general with a large group of chefs, switched on waiting staff and a small group of gardeners/farmers looking after the fruit and veg. Is this the Garden of Eden ? Well, it wouldn't be as much fun on a rainy day even though the eating areas are well covered and, in my opinion, a little more weeding wouldn't go amiss even if the philosophy is to leave things natural (no insecticides, no pesticides). That said, this is the greener side of Singapore and deserves a cheer both for its approach and for its excellent products. Bravo 
5
I loved the concept of this place and when I got there, I was impressed to see how they had paid attention to every detail. Not only is the food delicious and original, but the design of everything around really enhances the experience. The service was knowledgeable and friendly too
4
Lots of hype surrounding this place focusing on farm to table dishes. Their greens are freshly picked from their garden outside and served in their beautifully done up restaurant. Worth a go for brunch, coffee or dinner. Many exotic dishes to try! Lamb and curry scotch egg + thai chili crab pappardelle are definite must tries
5
Fresh produce, great food and reaonsable price. Arwsome service for the team. Loving this place and will surely come back and recommend to frens. Worth then penny.
5
Nice locations especially outside next to the wonderfull spice and vegetable gardens. Friendly staff that recognizes returning customers. Prices quite steep with small portions, but truly innovative and delicious dishes.
5
A wonderful place to bring your family, great afternoon with the kids. An awesome concept using fresh ingredient harvested in their backyard. The food was scrumptious with a lot of variety and the friendly staff made the brunch very enjoyable. We will definitely be back, maybe without the kids for dinner next time

As Julia Childs says: 'you don't have to cook fancy or complicated masterpieces - just good food from fresh ingredients!' Any food lover would understand that statement and it's true to form at OFC.We were here for brunch on a beautiful, breezy Sunday with another family. We sat outdoors which was a bit warm, but they strategically placed cooler fans for our comfort - and our friend's little pet dog.For the children we chose lasagna and macaroni cheese - but it's not ordinary. It was rich in natural flavour of it's ingredients.Then for us adult, we had, Grilled haloumi salad for starters - excellent!!! For mains we had Red Grouper, Mud crab spaghettoni with thai curry sauce - a must try! and Mangalica pork collar. ALL of it was well prepared, carefully cooked and passionately presented. Oh and of course the Dessert - we had Lemon tart with basil ice cream and the Hot & cold chocolate cake. We preferred the Lemon tart - it was something different and the basil ice cream is very creative and a big hit! The Hot & Cold Chocolate cake was also very good, but it didn't impress as well as the Lemon Tart.Fortunately the food is great, the ambience is relaxing and it's a great environment for the children.Sadly, as per most establishments in Singapore - the low standard and frustrating quality of service puts a dent the hard work of the chefs, marketing department and the owners who've put in so much effort to make a place a success.The waiter in charge of our table was friendly and enthusiastic. Bless her, she tried her very best to do everything right but of course when it's a team - she is at the mercy of others. Unfortunately, the 'others' weren't as switched-on or assertive as she was. Our main meals arrived before our starters - so we asked them to serve them accordingly, meaning we sent back the mains and got them to bring out our starters first. Then two of the drinks we ordered never came, despite chasing it up a number of times - but was charged for it. Plus, there was another mysterious 'beer' that made it on our bill without us ordering it. SO CHECK YOUR INVOICE BEFORE YOU PAY!The 'table usher' who is the first point of contact and bring with them a certain value due to providing the first impressions on the guests - also is a disappointment.Overall, we would still recommend it as the food is very good, the set up is great for family, friends & couples - just lower your expectations on the level of service
4
We had the best breakfast dishes at OFC, the eggs truffle were really good. The atmosphere is absolutely charming and service is great. Lovely playground for the kiddos outside. Also check their special events, we went when they organized a community market outside and it was really nice. The only downside is that they are victims of their success and one has to book brunch 3 weeks in advance..
1
Stopped by to pick up a coffee being a big fan of Common Man but I am sad to say it did not have the quality of a CM coffee. I could not even finish the cup. There are too many great coffee places in Singapore to choose from so I won't stop by again. It is a shame as a great setting and concept with outdoor seating. I have been to the restaurant once when they first opened. Great atmosphere, but a very limited menu for a healthy eating vegetarian. I will try it again and see if there are more 'veggie' dishes on the menu.
2
We had heard about this place for brunch, but could never get a booking, Finally we got a dinner booking and were VERY disappointed. The prices are huge and the portions minuscule. $30+ entrees and you have to order sides. At least $150pp. That's too much for this kind of place. Never again for dinner
4
Had a very nice time with excellent food. Some products are coming directly from their own farm which guarantee the freshness of the food.We have tried many different dishes and all of them were very tasty and well presented on the plate.The service was great.Warmly recommend this restaurant.
4
80 people descended on the restaurant with the expected chaos ensuing. They had accommodated us in the air-conditioned inside and still had open house outside. The staff were really good and managed us 80 rather happy and excited guests with aplomb and panache. We had a 3 course set meal with free flow house wine, beer and homemade lemonade. Food was excellent especially serving so many people at the same time. Kudos to the kitchen for getting it out to our time table - we were an hour late arriving but this did not impact service and quality. I need to go back and try the a la carte menu
5
Tried for the first time as I am a big Ryan Cliff fan. The food didn't disappoint me. Great flavours and presentation. Service is good. I did find that it was very noisy though full of woman lunching with high pitched voices. Have been told the noise issue is being worked on so look forward to going back again to try the rest of the yummy looking dishes on the menu. I like the concept that they have their own vegetable garden and they you can play lawn bowls of you fancy the exercise after lunch. Can thoroughly recommend Open Farm
5
Eaten here three times and it's always been good. Food v good every time. Service is generally good but sometimes inconsistent.
But the acoustics make it hard to talk inside. Shouldn't be too hard to fix.

- socially-minded collab between an urban farm, a luxury wellness group, and a top chef, Ryan Clift.- across the road from the Botanic Gardens, it is a small restaurant surrounded by a garden/farm.- food, service and ambience are all great - come for dinner, or weekend brunch.- family-friendly, educational activities available.- regularly hosts workshops and events to promote green living and urban farming
5
Location: opposite botanical gardens Tanglin gate side Price: Lunch-starter+mains+dessert average $60++Food: Has tried the Asian crab pasta, barramundi, hot salad and hot n cold chocolate cake. So far, the food I have tried are all nicely n freshly cooked and they tasted very good. Quantity is quite generous. Ambience: very soothing with the restaurant sets within a vegetables farm and using lots of wooden furniture. Very creative in its decor too. Good place for having a meal with friends.

Heard about this place, and decided to give a try. It was a Sunday night, quite full but we got our seats pretty fast. We had a choice of indoor or outdoor, since it is facing a garden (fear of mosquitoes) so we thought it's better to stay indoor.Loving the fact that their ingredients are locally sourced! As for the taste, it was alright, but a little pricey for the given portion. Nevertheless, i would definitely go again for lunch/high tea to check out their garden once more ! The place might be a little hard to spot at night especially for first-timer. I suggest you grab a taxi at Redhill station to get there. For those who are driving, not to worry, there's a parking space right in front of the restaurant. Not quite sure why, i find the whole area pretty quiet at night. Getting out might be a little bit difficult. Try your luck with uber
5
Well worth trying on the weekends for Sunday lunch / brunch. Setting is perfect with garden surrounds, lawn bowls, table tennis set up, etc. The menu is extensive and delicious - ingredients are locally sourced, seasonal, etc... an idea which has to be encouraged in Singapore! Very popular and busy - but every time we've been it has been very busy with children running around the inside dining area. Still, highly recommended
3
Lovely place for a relaxed lunch with really good food. i would definitely order the barammundi with hummus and grilled eggplant and cucumber mint dressing. Service is okay but its very noisy . I was there for a business lunch and it was very hard to speak across a large table setting. The hamoumi salad as a starter is delicious as well. Nice place to have brunch on a Sunday with little kids as they would love the play area and graden. Unique concept for Singapore
3
First time here with friends who heard good reviews. Upon stepping in, first impression was that it was like a fish market - the noise drowns everything and I actually had to shout to talk to my friend seated next to me. We ordered 2 starters, 4 mains and 2 desserts. The food was good, not fantastic but acceptable. Although for that kind of pricing, I would expect more. There is a playground just outside which suggests that the place is probably targeted more at families and hence the noise level. Will bring my kids next time as I think kids will love the place more than adults.

We heard a lot about this place so we popped by for a couple of beers on their terrace. Its a lovely setting but watch your credit card if they ask you to open a tab. They ended up swopping my credit card with another guest and it was nowhere to be found. Not a good start

Been to OFC a few times, and have been impressed each time by the impeccable food quality and the fresh ingredients. Every dish was beautifully crafted and plated, and not to mention the interesting fusion of Asian and Western flavours. A whole lot of effort had obviously been put into creating each dish! Staff were also polite on every visit. Will be back again and definitely recommending OFC to friends

I was so enthusiast by the overall concept. The place is super nice, beautiful decoration, good looking menu etc.BUT. The dining room is so noisy you can't speak to your neighbor. In our case we had booked a table outside (and were reminded several times to be there on time because after 10min the table would be given to someone else) but were seated inside, next to the open kitchen. We were seated on 3 round tables so it was impossible to chat with our friends seating on the 3rd table (because of seat disposition and noise). The menu looks good but 25$ before tax for 12 rigatoni (I counted them since it was ridiculously small) is really not acceptable, even in Singapore. But I was lucky, my friends with the pumpkin gnocchi weren't that blessed and they were served the equivalent of 3 tablespoons of pasta (they could at least serve the gnocchi on a smaller plate so it looks less empty). Same for desert. So overall very disappointed, especially because I was really looking forward to this concept. We left feeling hungry and robbed

Great concept and really fresh food. Not the fastest service but for Sunday brunch there was no rush.
Children's food was brought before adults and quite quickly which was appreciated.
Lemon basil tart was a real winner

Really great service, lovely fresh salads and my three sometimes fussy eating children loved the pasta sauces, the pesto in particular was amazing! Super ingredients and a lovely venue....the desserts were inventive and so delicious!!

The food is excellent, flavours go together well and they aren't too 'wanky' about the food - its not trying to be Heston Blumenthal, just good food some of which is grown fresh there / in Singapore.

While Open Farm Community's concept of sustainably and responsibly sourced produce is a good one, its service and food quality leave much to be desired.Note though, that I ate at the open-air cafe as the indoor dining area was full, so my review is specifically for the cafe.I tried to find a particular wine on their shelf and couldn't so asked the counter staff for assistance. He asked me to look on the shelf and I said I had but couldn't find it. He then muttered something inaudible and went on to ignore me. I gave up and ordered coffee instead.The food and and beverages took some time comingâ€”in fact, the drinks arrived only after I had almost finished my sandwich!Wait staff bringing food and drinks out to the seven or eight tables were often confused as to which table they were supposed to serve. I lost count of the number of times wait staff kept going to table after table with the same dish(es), while customers at another table would be gesturing that the dish was theirs.I sampled both the poached chicken breast and pork collar sandwiches. The pork collar was alright, with slightly fatty meat nicely offset by coleslaw-like beet shreds. The chicken breast was, however, dry and salty, and the overly spicy curry powder could not mask this fact.Overall, I would certainly not come back again

Having visited once before and turned down because it was fully booked, this time we booked in advance. On the day, we even got a message to confirm booking once again.When we got there at 9pm, the restaurant was packed and the atmosphere was lively. The ambience is cosy and also informal. The table on the side of restaurant give you a good view of what's happening in the kitchen and rest of place. The menu is extensive and some of the produce is picked from the onsite lot. We went for spagettoni with Thai curry sauce, salad with mushrooms and anchovies and the sea bass. None disappointed. The spagettoni i.e. Spaghetti much thicker was different in the Thai curry and the sea bass was awesome, tender and with a chives and yogurt dressing which was sharp and fresh. The salad was also very good.Almost forgot the desert ... Mango with coconut. Recommended!Overall a very good restaurant and look forward to revisiting and check out some other options on the menu

Went to Open Farm Community a couple of times with work.During both times the food tasted good. After all, its not often that you have the veggies that you eat picked from a garden just a few meters from your table. The concept is fresh in Singapore and it makes for good dinner conversation.Some other points: - I found the prices on the medium/high end side. - The service is good- The main dining area can get very noisy to the point where you cannot hear the person across from you if you are in a big group- The garden tables area is nice on a not too warm/humid night, more tranquilOverall positive view, will probably return
5
This isn't a new concept, but it is newer to Singapore. Seeing the farm as you walk through the parking lot and around the restaurant brings about a certain appreciation that may not exist with other restaurants. The atmosphere is quieter than many restaurants since it is removed from much of the hustle and bustle. I would definitely retur

Loved the 'farm to fork' concept, although not sure how much of the ingredients came from the farm. Shared the lamb rump, pork collar and coal baked barramundi. The fish was tender and soft, with tinge of charred flavour. Pork collar was really juicy and almost melted in the mouth. Lamb rump was not too outstanding. Textures of coconut was a really interesting way of cooking coconut. Basil ice cream was subtle and went well with the mango. A light-hearted way to spend the evenin

I had high expectations since the Tippling Club guys were behind this place. I was not disappointed either. Even if if you ignore the fact that they are striving to locally source all their ingredients the food is just really good. I had the Managelica Pork Collar and loved it. So tender and savory and yummy. My wife had the Gnocchi which I also tried and again, very good. When we booked it was a bit short notice and we couldn't get a table inside but our outdoor table was the most pleasant I've ever had due to outdoor airconditioning units. If you have a tough time with the heat and have to take a table outside maybe you can request a table near one of these units. I was very comfortable

The garden is amazing and given it is urban Singapore even more special.The food lived up to the garden. Clear flavours and interesting twists on standard dishes. Coffee is also very good.Not sure if other diners got the restaurant in its first weeks, but service was superb. Prices are not cheap when ++ of Singapore Gst and service are added, but you do have an amazing surrounding so it has a lot more character than a soulless hawker market in the heartlands.

Beautifully designed space with their farming gardens all around for their ingredients, it's a great venue for a lunch with friends. Great food - make sure to try the squid ink tagliatelle!

food is not really as good as expected, though everything is very fresh, taste-wise somewhat lacking, and does not quite justify the price tag the smoothies and juices are way overpriced at $10 for the tiny portions (not even a mac regular cup size, more like kids meal juice cup size) garden setting is lovely, big open windows with lots of natural light, would love to sit outdoors if not for the hot singapore weatherdesserts were a miss too, the warm choc cake had some yellow bits of sponge-like thingy that looks like the sponge bits you use for flower arrangement, not appetising at allplating is also very off, with the food laid on 1 side of the plate like somebody's forgotten to fill up the plate properly or half the portion have been stolen, very strange lookingstarters were way better than the mains (though majorly overpriced too)some dishes we had:barramundi - fish is fresh but veg&sauce tastes weirdsalad, great taste, small portion, weird platinglemon tart with basil ice cream - tart is great, basil ice cream tastes weirdwouldn't come back again, even the coffee portions are too small (long black looked more like an espresso

I organised dinner for 6 friends we were seated at 2 pushed together small round tables, so we were not off to a good start. After waiting 10 minutes we asked fro menus, after another 5 minutes we asked for water, after another 10 minutes we asked for someone to take our order. After another 20 minutes we asked where the wine we ordered was. The meals arrived in a haphazard way with some at the table receiving meals whilst others waited 15 minutes to receive their's. No sign of any staff supervision, or management, staff seemed woefully undertrained

Had a great Lunch at this place with the family last weekend. Tried the homemade pasta- really fresh and tasty. Must say service was spot on and this place is superb for kids. Avocado & Ginger Soup was refreshing, Desserts to die for. Huge outdoor garden growing veggies and herbs- even a small distillery near the restaurant.Will be back here soon.

We tried to come down for a late lunch this weekend. It was our first time down so I wanted to find out where exactly it was in Dempsey. I got my daughter to call ahead to find out what's the location. My daughter said we were on our way down for lunch, is it still open, and where was the place. We got the directions. And when we arrived there we found out there was a private event going on! N we couldn't eat in the restaurant We asked the receptionist (this blonde lady w v blue eye shadow) why we were not told there was a private event on when we called to say we were coming down. And she said, "how would I know u r coming to the restaurant. U could have asked for directions to come here to do other things". Ok...it was our first time there. N wasn't open farm community known foremost as a restaurant. Apparently not! So we had to leave. We didn't appreciate that she was kind of rude too

Food in this place is on par with other regular brunch places. Prices are on the relatively high side, both for food and beverages.Service was terrible, we waited for almost 30min for both the mains and desserts, and noticed that the kitchen looked way too laid back to even appear excited to prepare the food for their hungry diners.Will not pay this place a repeat visit
5
What can I say? Had dinner here on Sunday night and the place was buzzing. Waiters were friendly and polite and provided recommendations for dishes. We had a couple of starters and mains and everything was delicious. Would definitely come back here regularly. It also looks like a cool place to hang out with friends/ mini-gatherings. It has a really nice vibe. I would definitely come back here for lunch so I can enjoy the surroundings of the restaurant
5
Great new location, herbs planted everywhere, indoor and outdoor seating. Great food, great service. You get to see the plating done in an open kitchen. Beef was good, fish was good, the soups all good. Oysters would taste better with lemon slices which you can ask. Great place to bring clients, romantic dates, and to hang out. I would definitely come back.

The Open Farm Community has great decor, a very fresh appeal (it is in the middle of lush greenery after all), and is well lit. The cutlery is gorgeous too. The restaurant was quite noisy though and the food was not up to the mark at all.There were a few of us that went by for lunch and ordered different things: Halloumi Salad (the most oily salad I've ever had - everything was coated with a thick sheen of olive oil and the bread was deep fried), Orecchiette Salad (which was supposed to have tonnes of vegetables but we had to play a 'Find the Vegetable' game - barely a few slivers of beet, onion, & broccoli). The desserts sounded delectable but missed the mark too: Lemon Pie with Basil ice Cream (was too strong on both lemon and basil, no subtle or mild creamy hints at all); Caramelised Mango with different shades of Coconut (a bit of a saving grace). The coffee though does deserve a positive mention. We had Mochas, Cappuccinos, & Espressos - all of them were very well brewed. However, if I had to go that far for pretty cutlery and coffee, I wouldn't

restaurant? bistro? Cafe? Commune? Well like it's own description its first of its kind so perhaps not that easy to categorizeWe had one brunch item (Roast Wagyu rump), and one main (lamb rump from the normal menu. Apart from the sou vide preparation, nothing to shout about. Portions could have been bigger.Desserts were better, scored higher on presentation than taste. The mango was quite tasteless.Coffee was A grade.Overall restaurant price for bistro quality.One visit for the novelty perhaps.The flies from the garden would keep me from returning
5
We came here for dessert and shared the caramelised mango with coconut sago , coconut ice cream and coconut meringue . This is a dish to come back for !
4
We were walk-in customers and they managed to give us a seat at the communal table. The food was absolutely wonderful. We had two different servers, one very good and attentive, the other one a sleeping pill, who took 15 minutes to pick-up the bill even though he walked past 20 times

So there are few places that are great for kids. Adults eat their meal in peace and kids go play. This place has a sandpit and two giant elephants playground. It's wonderful. This means it's perfect for toddlers and children alike. At the back there is even urban farming so the children can do a little exploration. So it's wonderful for a family day out Food on the other hand is different. The children's menu is the same price as the adults menu so I am not sure they get the plot - but then the portion is about the same size - so one can know where they coming from. In other words, food here is slightly expensive compared to other places like this as the portions are smaller. Food is so so. We had the spaghetti on children's menu - too salty. Thai curry pasta very spicy. Pancakes as usual 3 pieces but small including the ice cream. Other food like the avocado soup or the risotto are interesting but not amazing. Deserts all looked amazing though. Service was so-so. Staff were wonderfully friendly but because they were so busy we waited more than half an hour for our main course to come, not all of us had utensils or water and the place was very noisyAll In all the place was very hip and happening but the experience failed to live up to expectations.

We visited Open Farm community with friends last Friday night and enjoyed a superb meal in a relaxed and stylish environment.The restaurant is beautifully designed, with attractive fairy lights above casual tables and a bar. Staff were welcoming, helpful and friendly. We were served drinks fairly promptly and then settled down to choose from the array of very appetizing choices.Feeling hungry (and pre-warned by a friend that servings were fairly small) we went for starters. The cold avocado soup was incredible, and our other choices were all delicious. Starter sizes were reasonably generous, though mains came up small. However, all our food tasted so incredibly fresh and healthy, with unusual flavours perfectly combined, that we had no complaints. It just meant we still had space to add on some desserts! Again, these were generously sized and delicious. The cheese plate was fabulous - our only quipple would be that it came with a ridiculously small amount of bread for the quantity of cheese supplied, and when we were asked for more we were told this would be an additional $8. Not the end of the world, but a bit petty considering we were already paying well over $100 a head.This is definitely some of the best food we've had in Singapore - we'll definitely be back

New and extremely popular - for very good reasons. Food is fresh, wholesome and well portioned. As is customary for Singapore - the wine is over priced but not as eye-watering as other places. Would benefit for a few more options at the $60-80 price point - which is where most of the existing wines on the menu should be at (at present you're looking at $100 per bottle for anything decent), and then introducing a couple of bigger hitters at the $100+ mark

This was my 3rd visit to the restaurant. The decor is gorgeous. Lots of natural light in the indoor area. Cool color scheme and layout.The outdoor area is relaxed and has a sand pit and cool playground for kids. Lovely open space in the heart of town.The food has been consistent in terms of quality and presentation. The dishes I have tried, pumpkin tortellini with pine nuts, mud crab spaghettoni with curry sauce ( too salty) and the warm broccoli salad came beautifully presented. The lemon tart with basil sauce is a must try. My biggest gripes with this restaurant - the lack of parking lots and the noise level. We sat indoors in air-conditioning and it was incredibly noisy. It was hard to have a decent conversation with our dining companions without raising our voices to be heard. On my 3rd visit, the staff left the doors to the indoor area open and we were all sweating profusely. Not a pleasant experience. Our lunch reservation was at 130pm and there were no parking lots available. Best to car pool or be prepared to park at St Georges' Church and walk about 300m to the restaurant

Loved the decor. Cool & relaxed. The food was great. We had quite a good selection of starters & mains were good all around. Lemon Tart Basil ice cream was awesome. Would come back just for that. But I had a friend who came back another day for the curry pasta & felt that it was overly salty. Would be back soon for another round of yummy food. Pimms was rather strong. Haloumi was better at ODP

Singapore is a built up city with many buildings. When you think of a farm, you will have to travel a distance to the outer edges of Singapore to visit one. Its even harder to find a restaurant located in a farm.Now, you can find both a farm and restaurant right in the heart of the city. This place is located at Dempsey, directly opposite Singapore Botanic Gardens.This restaurant has garnered quite a good crowd, judging by food photos popping onto my Social Media feeds. I came by for lunch recently with my friends. Here are the highlights of my meal:- Seared tuna with green papaya and Jicama salad: $26. Great presentation. The green papaya is reminiscent of Thai papaya salad without the spices and its thicker grated slices. The Jicama salad was also good. It reminded me of Japanese green seaweed. It has a texture of ‘jellyfish’. Liked the freshly-grated coconut in it. It’s nice!- Poached yabbies with chilled avocado and ginger soup with fresh radish: $20. Also good. The server will pour the green soup, which is light avocado juice with slight ginger taste. Scoop up the pieces of avocado, locally-farmed yabby and the soup and its heaven in your mouth.- Coal-baked omelette with smoked haddock, tarragon and grain mustard mornay: $24. The eggs has a texture of scrambled eggs and it nice and creamy. The smoked haddock was lovely. Overall a nice dishWe had some pastas. The pastas here are all house-made. - Strozzapreti with 48 hour Barolo braised oxtail: $26. This pasta is the spiral variety. The braised oxtail is yummy and the sauce clings on to the pasta well. This is topped with parmesan wafers (which I liked) and wild thyme.- Mud crab spaghettoni with Thai curry sauce: $28. The pasts is thick, much like Japanese udon noodles. Its coated with a orangey Thai curry sauce which was spicy. Tossed in it were crunchy yellow squash and coconut. Its topped with a good helping of de-shelled mud crab and garnished with crispy Thai Basil. I liked the kick of the sauce, which is unique.- Potato dumpling gnocchi: $26. The gnocchi has a good bite. It was served atop a good helping of sun-dried tomato jus, shredded pork sausage and topped with sliced fresh fennel. Good contrast of textures. Mains:- Roasted baby chicken: $28. Chicken is nice and tender including the white parts – chicken breast meat. Served with roasted potato and hazelnuts. I liked the sauce which is a nice reduction and is umami.- Coal-baked barramundi: $26. The fish is locally-sourced and its fresh. Simply baked, it was moist and tasty. Came with cucumber coleslaw, roasted eggplant puree and fresh mint dressing. Eggplant puree is spiced with curry and is nice.For dessert, we had:- Hot & Cold chocolate cake with chocolate sorbet and mint meringue: $17. Chocolate lovers will like this dessert. There’s cake, sorbet and meringue, offering different textures with each spoonful.- Caramelised mango with textures of coconut: $17. This reminds me a lot of the local mango sago dessert. Mango has a nice caramelisation on the outside and the sago has a good dose of coconut milk and grated coconut. Refreshing and nice! - Lemon tart with basil ice cream: $17. This was pretty and nicely plated. You get 3 biscuits and the lemon curd was piped in between. I loved the green paste with chia seeds and basil ice cream. Its very good.The restaurant uses herbs, garnishes grown in their garden and uses these natural herbs to impart flavour to their dishes.Before or after your meal, you can walk around the grounds and explore the farm, where you can spot familiar herbs and vegetables growing. If the farmer is there, do speak to him and he will be happy to share interesting facts about the plants.The restaurant has a good variety of wines on tap. They work with wine-growers who age their wine in barrels and then ship over via barrels, which ensures the wines are fresh and also eco-friendly.They also have got an outdoor play area for children – a sand pit and for older children and adults - a table tennis table and lawn bowl.Great place for a meal and for hanging out with nature

Having only just read the flurry of articles online about this new restaurant, I stepped in for a Monday lunch without a reservation. My saving grace was that I arrived early and so was able to bag a table. I like the concept of a restaurant in the Dempsey Hill area that is striving to grow some of its herbs and vegetables. Sustainability is very much a buzzword for our times. Kudos to the Spa Esprit Group, Chef Ryan Clift and Edible Gardens for collaborating on this winning concept.Being absolutely ravenous, I ordered some pretty hefty dishes starting with Strozzapretti with 48 Hour Barolo braised oxtail, parmesan wafers & wild thyme, certainly a robust dish. Given the heat of the day I should have ordered something cooler and salad-ish but I soldiered on. The next dish was also heavy although I had no complaints - Coal baked omelette with smoked haddock, tarragon & grain mustard mornay. For my main, I had the charred rump of lamb served on top of a smooth mash with ribbons of lettuce and peas. The lamb was nicely pink and frankly delicious except that someone had dialed the salt meter a tad too high, a real shame. Still feeling greedy, I ate a dessert of lemon tart (deconstructed) with layers of cream and lemon curd served with a fresh basil ice cream on the side.The room got progressively busier as lunch service continued but I had a relaxing time & was pleasantly surprised to see Fabian Schenk, formerly of Gattopardo - a familiar face among an enthusiastic of servers. I will be returning soon for another meal to try the other dishes on the menu

We were very excited to try this new restaurant and liked the very quirky setting and decor. The food was well presented and very tasty from a good menu. What was a little disappointing was that as a party of 5 we were seated at two small round tables and that even though it was tasty some people's food was occasionally cold because of the delay in others food being delivered late to the table ( and it was a a fish dish so had no reason to be late). Despite this we would go to the Open farm community again
