Thumbs down to the salad. Can't even compete with the one at Amoy street market. Expensive and lousy. Won't visit it again.

My second time at the Pasarbella brunch and still a lovely visit. Ordered the Dos Amigos eel maki and a Yuzu poké bowl and was pleasantly stuffed. Perfect flavour for many people's tastebuds. :) Amount given for the price was worth it.

I recently went to new outlet at SBF tower (Tanjong Pagar area). Love the atmosphere, musics were nice, helpful and enthusiastic staffs, coffees are excellent. Their salmon rolls are very delicious and worth the price.
Definitely going to get back there.

Not worth the price. Cost and portion are not quite proportional. Restaurant promotes healthy eating but utensils are all disposable ones, not environmental friendly. Taste wise roll is good. salad is very average.

Our third visit to the Star Vista outlet and it never fails to deliver yummy & healthy fare!Must order are the Sunkissed Salmon Roll and the Aloha Poke BowlComplete your meal with the refreshing cold Yuzu Jasmine Tea!Only downside about this place is its small seating capacity...we end up sitting counter-style next to each other & facing the window

I've been to Rollie Ollie a few times with my family, most recently this April. There is a variety on the menu with their handmade sushi rolls being the star of the dish. My family has a lot of special dietary requirements (no gluten, no dairy, no crab or lobster, etc) and we had an easy, efficient lunch here. I ordered the 'Tree Hugger Skinny Rolls' expecting to have just a regular no-wheat skinny roll. What I got was a addicting, moreish platter of carefully made heaven. I recommend both Skinny Rolls, Burger Beef Patty, Aloha PokÃ© bowls and the Go-Green Sushi Roll. 10/10 :

I recently had the chance to check out a relative newcomer to SG's dining scene in the west. Rollie Olie is located in Star Vista shopping centre, which is very easy to get to.This turned out to be one of the best spur-of-the-moment restaurant decisions I've made in a long time (and my boyfriend agreed).We shared three dishes from the innovative menu. One was called K-Pop - these turned out to be a sort of Korean take on sushi rolls, flavoured with kimchi. Absolutely delicious. We also had the tree hugger skinny rolls (these might have been my favourite). Finally, we had a poke bowl, also fantastic. For drinks, we had iced lemon tea, which personally I found too sweet. I would suggest that Rollie Olie consider adding perhaps a green tea drink, even hot green tea, which I think would go well with the cuisine.All the fish and other ingredients were at the peak of freshness (which to me is very important). As well, the restaurant is immaculately clean. Oh, and this is some of the best value for $$ I've found in Singapore - a satisfying dinner that definitely won't break the bank.I had only one major criticism, and that relates to the use of all disposable dishes and utensils. In other words, everything is served in take-away containers, and drinks are served in single-use plastic cups with a plastic straw. This might not bother most people, but as a conservation biologist, it bothered me. I brought it up to the manager (who, by the way, was extremely friendly and receptive to suggestions). He explained that in this outlet (apparently there are plans to open a second location in Suntec City) there isn't enough room to have a proper dishwasher, which therefore raises the completely valid concern about food safety. He also told me that other patrons had raised the same issues with him. However, I suggested that at the least, they consider abandoning the use of plastic straws.This issue (plus the overly sweet iced tea) are the reasons why I didn't give this restaurant an 'excellent' rating.I will DEFINITELY go back here, but next time, I will just bring my own plates, water bottle and utensils (this is something they are receptive to, and in fact, they encourage customers to bring their own containers for takeaway.If you're looking for a creative, delicious and super healthy meal that is clearly made with care and beautifully presented, run, don't walk to Rollie Olie
