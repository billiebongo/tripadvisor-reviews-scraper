Nothing really special about this stall. I think their laksa is little bland. Their chicken meat was smooth and served with generous amount of taupok.

All time favourite! Grew up eating this, Childhood food!
Though standard dropped a little, but still good! Eat and you will know *slurp

The laksa gravy is substandard and very watery, the taste is no more there , not the good taste I love. Will not go back again after several disappointment.

Used to patronised regularly, but recently price increased and standard drop, as usual with quite a umber of other stalls, once popular the food becomes expensive and lousy. I will not go back
PStall owner is a little proud because of the Long queue.

I'm surprised at some of the poor reviews for this place. I think some reviewers don't understand there different styles of laksa in Singapore, same for bak ku teh. This style is more spicy with less coconut gravy than the Katong ones. I know quite a few locals who view this one as one of the best, if you like the style. It is probably my favorite laksa in Singapore. I also like the sweeter, coconut ones from Katong, though I prefer this spicier version. I have been there several times in 2017 and it's the same family serving, and the taste seems the same to me. Highly recommended, just go early

Only having tasted this this from Katong Laksa, I thought I give it a try, and queued (on a Sunday) for 30 minutes to taste. The only good thing was, it was better than the Katong Laksa at Holland V. However, the soup, lacked the 'punch'. I normally would lick the bowl dry, but, this one, I did not. It opens everyday except Mondays and Fridays, from about 05.30hrs till 1400hrs

The laksa here is fantastic . . just as i like it full of tofu .There is a long queue, and I can understand why people want to eat the laksa.I had read food blogs , and at one the laksa here had been voted the best . . and of the ones I tried on this trip to Singapore . . it is also mine. Tanglin Halt food marked is full of locals, and when I was there the only foreigner. which is a good sign . .. Just go . . you will not regat it

Lived in commonwealth when I was in Singapore for school a couple of years back, and this place was definitely on par with Katong laksa.Finally had a chance to go back to Singapore and this place was on the highest of the list to revisit, and they definitely didn't disappoint! Arrived at 10:30 in the morning and the line was 15ish long! They have the best soups and put in the most generous amount of cockles! We were in Tanglin Halt for like an hour, and the lineup never stopped while we were eating.Still the best Laksa in Singapore!
