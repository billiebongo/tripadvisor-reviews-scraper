Loved the BBQ Pork with rice and sauce. Cost S$18.00 but so delicious. Didn't try the duck. A very clean classy restaurant.

A good Peking Duck restaurant based on Hong style. Generous and delicious Duck. Very good porridge and lime and lemonade drink. No frills but good quality.

The Peking Duck here is great, crispy skin with virtually no fat! The taste of the duck meat is better than some of the well known restaurants. Cost SGD S52.00 per duck. Well priced.The shrimp wonton is fresh, the vege is nice too. The service staff are friendly too.Will come back to try the rest of the dishes the next time.
