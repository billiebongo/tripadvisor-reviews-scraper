This neighborhood restaurant serves outstanding halal food. Every dish I have ordered is very good, especially the chili crab, salted egg prawns and fresh steamed fish. Easily accessible a short walk from the LRT station - Teck Whye stop.

Seafood is not too bad at this shop, its quite nice. Chinese dishes were quite well prepared but the portion is a little small and forcing yourself to upsize the dish for at least decent. Western shop is so-so but really, if youre coming here, get the seafood shop. Horfun was nice
