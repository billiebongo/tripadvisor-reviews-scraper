We were actually disapointed with food in China town so opted for dinner here before our flight, it was very well priced and plenty to choose from.

The Orchid cafe is located within the Orchid Hotel complex in the centre of Tanjong Pagar.
They provided us with a great value buffet breakfast comprising of a huge and diverse selection of food styles.
Prices are very reasonable and well worth a visit.

Decent spread with reasonable price! The soup is perfect but limit choices... not that I have anything to complain about with the kind of charges. Servers are friendly and fast. Worth coming back!

Only had breakfast 2 mornings and thought it was very average. Most food was only warm except the bacon which we had to wait for it to be cooked.

I had lunch and it was nice with reasonable prices.
The service was a bit slow though and there was a table with many quests and they were noisy, but I can not complain as it was not the restaurants fault.

This is an ideal eating place for large groups because it’s spacious and its buffet spread is always suitable for families and friends. There’s also the freedom to choose what to eat. It was our group’s favourite lunch haunt some years back but we have forgotten about it until we were real tired of western/fusion food. Staff are friendly too. It’s also a value for money meal. A must try

Easily accessible from Tanjong Pagar MRT which is just about 2 mins walk. The restaurant is inside Orchid Hotel and if i never remember wrongly, it is at level 3 as we took a lift up from the hotel lobby. I went on a weekday evening so there wasn't much crowd and the restaurant was actually pretty quiet throughout the whole evening which is really nice while i heard that they can get full house and you need to make reservations on weekends. The total bill came up to be $22 (Included all charges) per person which i think it is really very reasonable for the buffet spread that they had offered. Teochew style kind of food. Here are some food that i can remember. Stir Fried Celery with Mushroom, Chap Chai (Stired Fried Mixed Vegs), Steam fish, Sweet and Sour Pork, Braised Pork Leg, Buns, Kuehs, Bee Hoon noodles, Fried rice, Porridge, 2 types of Soup (Western and Asian), Salted egg, Spring rolls and some deep fried snacks, Fruits, Cakes, Ice Creams, Coffee and Tea. Really value for money and will definitely go back again

Located in the heart of Tanjong Pagar, the CBD district, this hotel at Tras Street do have a cafe, located on the 3rd storey that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet with the theme "Teochew Porridge".Right in front of the main entrance of the cafe was a beautifully decorated Orchid flower display and right next to it was the swimming pool.We were there on a rainy Tuesday evening and were ushered in by friendly staff. We were the very first customers of the day (arrived at around 6.10pm). The cafe was spacious and huge, in a L-shaped setting. Ambience was fine.After settling in, we helped ourselves with the food. With the theme "Teochew Porridge", there were quite a number of famous side dishes that were offered to go well with the sweet potato porridge such as the salted and olive vegetables, salted eggs, ikan bilis and peanuts, pork floss and some others. And if you think that's all, you are greatly wrong!There were also a good number of main Chinese/Asian dishes such as fried bee hoon, braised pork belly (very good), ayam fish (very good), black bean sauce fish (good but a bit salty), stir-fried vegetables, tofu, omelet egg, stir fried prawns (nice and fresh), braised chicken feet and pork trotters in soy sauce, kong bak pao (bun with sliced pork) and siew mai (pork dumpling) etc. On the day of our visit, the salted vegetable with duck soup and sweet potato soup were offered. The former was nice and yummy and the latter thick and flavourful.Besides these, there was also a small section for salad, a fresh fruit cum dessert corner with nonya kueh etc. Ice cream, orange juice and coffee/tea were also available.Overall, the food were nice and tasty though the spread was not large as compared to others.Service was good as staff were attentive and efficient in clearing our used plates and from time to time, even the manager also came by to clear the table.However, do be informed that the coffee/tea were not placed side by side with the orange juice or near the dessert area but at the other corner of the cafe, which is unique and uncommon for cafes. And staff also didn't inform diners about it until we saw diners who were seated near that corner helped themselves with the coffee then we realized that we could help ourselves with it too. Perhaps they should place the beverages together or at least put a label on it, so that those diners who seated away from the place would be informed of it.Throughout our dinning, there was a total of 18~20 diners for the evening and though the number was quite ok, considering it a weekday and outside raining heavily, it looked scare because the cafe was very huge.The buffet dinner was $19.80 per head and if you have certain bank's credit card, you will be entitled a 10% discount.Well, for this price and based on the quality and quantity of food and service offered, it was a good value for money, considering it in the downtown CBD area!And yes, we would be happy for a revisit soon

I have already visited this cafe twice during my 7 day stay in Singapore. The cafe is located in 3rd floor of Orchid Hotel and does not dissapoint in serving a delicious spread for lunch. The buffet consist of salad items, asian dishes and veg including cha kway teow snd chicken rice, teo chew porridge and associated items like egg omelet and stewed pork trotters, shrimp dumplings, fruit, sweets and ice cream. All for $16.80++. Oh, i forgot coffee and tea is included. The cafe is spacious and is airconditioned. Definitely value for mone

I frequent this restaurant for lunch on weekdays as it is within walking distance from my office. Located on the third floor of the hotel at the same level as the swimming pool, the decor is simple but spacious, airy and bright. The buffet spread has basically 3 sections -- The appetisers consist of 1 to 2 soups (1 western and 1 Asia), salads, cold meat and bread.- The main section consist mainly a Teochew porridge section with various small condiments such as pickled vegetables, century egg, peanuts. There are also about 8 to 10 main dishes such as omelette, vegetables, duck meat, chicken meat and rice, noodles, fish and tofu. There are also simple dim sum (buns) and chinese braised bun/ meat.- The last section consists of fruits, cakes, local desserts, a cold liquid-based dessert, a hot liquid-based dessert and two flavours of ice-cream.Drinks i.e. hot water, cold water, coffee, tea and orange juice, are free-flow.Service is good. Used dishes and cutlery get cleared from the table promptly.This place is touted as a Teochew prorridge place, but the spread is definitely more than just Teochew porridge unlike its sister restaurant Crystal Cafe at Orchard Grand Court Hotel. The food is generally of good quality e.g. the fish is fresh.Overall, this is a favourite lunch place for me. It is well worth the S$20 as it offers me a complete meal from soup, salad, main dishes to desserts and hot drinks. Given its location in the CBD, I can't ask for more

The Breakfast Buffet has average spread, but the taste of the foods is relatively good.
They serve toast, porridge, hash browns, eggs, pork bacon, chicken sausage and ham, mee siam, fruits, cereal, and beverages.

Had the breakfast buffet here and thought it was expensive for what it was at S$22. Not enough fresh fruit but if you are Asian eater then you seem to be well catered for!

The buffet at the restaurant is value for money. I tried a-la-cart options also. Food was descent.
Staff at the restaurant is friendly. A quiet place to enjoy lunch and dinner.

Dinner buffet is all majorly for those who prefer chinese / japanese food. I had to stick to only minimal options available in their A la carte menu.
2
First time trying out the buffet rather disappointed and can't compare with Grand Court. The food was too salty and limited spread. But must say the buffet counter was cleaned and the chefs kept topping up the food. No service at all. Staff seemed to be too free don't know what to do. Won't be coming back agai

Breakfast, Lunch, & Dinner here are cheap for buffet price, but the choice also limited, food quality is good, much of oriental menu, I think they will better to change all to modern chairs... its not quite fit design for this restaurant to emphasize the environment which are modern oriental..

We went there for porridge buffet on a saturday evening. The spread wasn't particularly impressive but for the small selection of food that they offer, the chefs made an extra effort to plate it well, keep the buffet area clean and tidy.There's free coffee, tea and unlimited serving of Orange juice! There a small salad counter and the mushroom salad is pretty good. As for the mains, all the porridge condiments are good. Best dishes includes: Steam prawn - it's fresh. Steam Fish - Taste good with Ginger. Pork trotters - Succulent.There's a small dim sum and dessert section too.All in all, the experience is pleasant.

At $16.80++ per head you get a decent buffet spread of teochew porridge and other chinese dishes, but other than the pig trotters and the braised chicken feet the rest are just passable. Still the buffet lunch is a good value for a group of friends to catch up over long lunch in the comfort of a hotel cafe, given its city central location and not crowded even for weekends

This restaurant is located on the third floor in the hotel, on the same level as the swimming pool and sauna. They serve buffet style Teochew Porridge and some other dishes like fried bee hoon, fruits, orange juice, coffee, tea, ice cream and some disserts.I find this place relatively cheap and the taste is not too bad. Please remember that this is not the full spread international buffet that you may see at other hotels. Then again the price is a fraction of what a typical hotel buffet would have cost.The location is good. The main entrance is located on Tras Street and not the busier Tanjong Pagar Road. You can either park at the hotel car park which is underground or there are some street parking. You can also explore parking opposite the hotel at the HDB carpark of Tanjong Pagar Plaza. For public transport the hotel is located about 5 minutes walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT station. You would take the same exit as to Amara hotel which is the left hand exit once you get out of the ticketing gate with your back facing the control station. You would take 2 flights of escalator after which the exit on your right. Once you get out you will see Orchid hotel right in front of you. You can't miss it. So if you are looking for a light meal of Teochew porridge you may give this place a try
