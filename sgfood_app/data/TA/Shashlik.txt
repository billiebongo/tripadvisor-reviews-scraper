Absolutely enjoyed dinner at Shashlik! Great food, good service and just a nice, cosy and homely place to have a meal with loved ones
5
They provide good services. As I had made reservation earlier, I was greeted by my name when I entered the restuarant. The bread was very nice as the bun served was still warm and soft.
5
Booked a mth ahead. Shashlik called me twice along the way to remind me. All staff awared that it was my booking when we arrived Well done!

Nice environment nice food nice service staff nice to dine with friends n family . dessert was a bit expensive
1
It is bad now. Not keeping up with standards. Meat was below average. Executed poorly. Desserts as well. Everything tasted like it has been frozen for awhile.

Value for money western food and really delicious food.
Friendly service and will return for
other food in the menu

I have been an avid patron of Shashlik since I was a kid and it has never failed to give me a good experience. I remember all the old staffs who were still there and it was Valentine's day and I decided to head there as i have not been there after it has been revamped. The food was good however i believe the staff might have missed out on my dessert and I had to wait more than 30mins for my dessert despite informing the staff twice. It was tormenting to see those at the other tables receive their dessert immediately although they came later than us. When the Baked alaska came, we didnt have much interest in it due to the long wait and had only eaten 2 spoons of it before we left as it was not worth waiting for. I felt that the staff could have apologized to us for the long wait or even offered something in return for the long waiting time.

I feel really bad for the people who think that what they are having here is Russian food. It is absolutely not. Unfortunately we have lost Buyan in Singapore and no longer have any restaurant here that serves anything close to authentic Russian cuisine. All they serve here is food with some Russian name but tastes nothing like it. I don't know what to make of the borsch. It was like I made it myself and failed to achieve the right taste. The meats were also over cooked, dry and tough. On top of that, service is curt and bordering rude, quite like the style of old Hong Kong cafes. Try this place only if you'd like to try some unusual (not authentic) tastes that's different from our usual Italian, Japanese, Korean cuisines. Good luck!

My first visit to this Russo- Hainanese restaurant and what a pleasant surprise. Have wanted to try it and lo-and-behold, my friends proposed we give it a try. I ordered the Sirloin steak, onion soup and for dessert the flaming Cherry Jubilee.. The service staff will arrive at your table and light up the dessert..Will definately be back.

My table of 12 pax was delighted to vote Shashlik as our top SG restaurant to inaugurate The Stylish Gourmand Dining Club. Chef Derrick was excellent, welcoming us warmly and serving us personally which was an unexpected surprise, seeing the restaurant was busy! He also transformed a Bomba Alaska into a Celebration Cake which was a great touch to our evening. Thank you! The shaslik, egg cavier, and bomba was as it was since we ate at Shashlik with our parents in our childhood. So very pleased it's reopened by the family keeping its look and feel unchanged. Will be back

Quiet place that is condusive for business lunches or dates. Lunch sets were value for money. Service was good.
5
Foods were great. Very nice ATMOSPHERE. My girlfriend were very satisfied overalls. Will be back to try other foods.
5
The food was delicious and the staff were friendly. This time, i opted to have the beef shashlik instead of my usual chicken kiev. It was well prepared in terms of the doneness and taste. And, as usual, the borsch was just lovely.
4
My first visit. However im pleasantly surprised with the food served. Service was fast and helpful. Place is suitable for big groups and family.
4
Friends like the food and service. The waitress is attentive by giving two baskets for us to leave our bags
5
Food standard remains same as last time, nice.. more food options, after renovation the restaurant still gives a cosy feeling as before
4
Had the baked fish with mushroom and the beef stragonof. They were delicious. Ambience was also good. Nice quiet place on weekday nights.
4
nice cosy restaurant and surprisingly quite pack for dinner . staffs were attentive. had the set meal - angus beef was bit too salty and over seasoned and the confi duck is also bit too salty,but their signature beef was really good. baked alaska was nice too. overall worth the money .
4
I loved the food and service there. My soup, the first course, appeared literally two minutes after I finished ordering, with the rest of my meal proceeding in a prompt and satisfactory manner. My water glass was also never empty. That said, if you are expecting Borsch from Russia or any other Russian food, this is not the place for you. The food has Russian influence, but it is done in the Hainanese style rather than pure Russian - which is to say that you are apt to find something flash-fried rather than pan-seared, or Asian spices added together with European herbs... Nonetheless, the quality of the food leads me to think that the chefs/creators of the menu must have taken care when crafting it, rather than simply following old recipes. It's great food that isn't too hard on the wallet.
5
We heard so much of their red meat signatures so Shaslik of lamb was a must. The grilled meat was certainly a delight! I was not disappointed with the set lunch beef stroganoff as well. All the meat was tender and flavorful. Very tempted to try their ice cream dessert but weâ€™re too full with the borsch, mains and hot drinks. Would want to visit Shaslik soon!
5
Nice ambience with friendly waitresses. Food is nice but slightly over priced. Environment is good for family and friends.
5
i was quite sad when the restaurant closed down 2 years ago and happy to know that the steak standard and customer service level is still the same when it reopens! Highly recommended!
4
Very good place good western food, everything is done perfectly. The service is render well. Good for couple
4
Came for the set lunch- soup, main and a cup coffee, real value for money. Borscht soup was really good!
4
Great food with reasonable prices! Will visit again. Good for family, friends gathering and birthday celebration.
5
Enjoyed the food thoroughly. Except the portobello mushroom too much meat filling for my taste. Service was excellent! Food quality is still good after so many years!
4
Very good beef and overall service was good. Baked Alaska was slightly burnt but ice cream was nice end to a nice meal
5
Hidden in an old, quiet shopping center, this is a gastronomic must-try. Reservations are usually necessary esp on weekends, but you may walk in and try your luck on weekdays. It’s newly renovated but the cosy ambience remains. The bread roll is soft and warm, nice enough to eat on its own. The trio mushroom soup is fragrant with the right consistency. The escargots are cooked to perfection. For mains, we order grilled pork chop, fish n chips, steak and chicken a la kiev. All the meats are soft, tender and perfectly done. Meat juices ooze out as you cut/bite into them. Salads are also fresh with just the right amount of light dressing. Chips are big, and crisp outside and soft inside. Everything is just so heavenly delicious. Prices are reasonable ($20+ for white meats and $30+ for steak), considering the quality and serving sizes. Staff are also friendly and helpful. This isn’t our first visit, and definitely won't be the last
5
Was here on 29 Nov with friends. Ordered their Borsch soup, signature skewered beef Shashlik (medium rare) and pork ribs. Beef was tender and my friends enjoyed their ribs too. Personally not a fan of pork ribs, but definitely better than those you get from Tony Romas. Very comfortable ambient. I will definitely visit again.
4
It was my first time to go there and we went there without booking in advance. Luckily, we tried our luck and walked-in and got a table. Food selection are nice and interesting. For appetizer, we had the escargot (yummy!) and the newly baked bread they serve is really fantastic. My friend had the beef for main course while I had pork as the main course. Both are equally tasty and well-marinated. Serving portion is a bit too big for me though. The dessert we ordered is Banana Flambe which is good, they prepare it in front of you so it was quite interesting. We also ordered Russian Coffee which had some preparation presentation as well. So it was quite fun to watch.Overall, the service staff were nice and friendly. They are respectful and accommodating. However, the above good experience was dented by the attitude of the man who handed us the bill and got our payment. We requested to provide two credit cards to split, I presented my credit card first then my friend did as well. Then the service staff (or maybe the cashier himself) just said in a dismissive tone that they do not accept splitting of bill and just took my friend's card. I find it it rude as he could have asked us which card he should use not just immediately take my friend's card. I wanted to raise to him however he just went off and it was a different person who gave back the card and receipt to my friend. The above incident happened on 25 November, around 9pm
5
Excellent dining experience!
Each course timed & served accordingly.
Excellent service!
Wonderful restaurant to enjoy a nice, leisurely meal!
4
Good place for couple dinner. Food standard dropped. I remember that it was much better before they were reopened.
5
Excellent food and a place filled with history. A must for those keen to know a bit of Singapore's history through food.
4
Ordered the oxtail stew, beef shashlik, baked Alaska dessert. Great tasting food. Service was great too.
4
Good food, good and clean environment. The staff very friendly and know how to recommend me what to eat. Thumb up
5
Their food taste great and they have good service. The dining ambience is great as well. I will definitely dine at Shashlik again.
4
The set lunch was reasonably priced at $16.90 per set but choices were limited.
Ala carte prices were okay too.
Good food, especially Borsch soup.
Do NOT go to Far East Plaza! The restaurant is at FAR EAST SHOPPING CENTRE!
5
Must try the baked Alaska. It’s fantastic. The cream melts nicely in the mouth.
The beef straganoff is flavourful. Must try.
5
Not been to this restaurant for a while since ownership was transferred during its last days about 2 years ago. I had fears food quality and type would change. But i was wrong, the food remains great albeit cooked with a nostalgic taste. The beef was very fresh and done just right. The favourite highlight of the meal was the dessert. Probably one of the last few places in singapore to offer traditional baked Alaska. Highly recommended.
5
I suspect It's been at least 25 years since I have been. Staff still seem familiar though! The food really isn't that Russian anymore but it's still great and comforting. Stuffed portobello mushroom was my Son's choice, Chicken filling was great though mushroom was on small side. Borsch soup was great and the escargots were garlicky n chewy. The shashlik beef was great and beef stroganoff was comfort food, as my Son described, its beef with chicken rice! Cherries flambÃ© great way to finish off, simple vanilla ice me cream plus cherries with a style in the preparation. Will definitely be back soon.
5
The Shashlik beef was so so tender and juicy. The baked alaska was not too bad as well, but we felt that the proportion of ice cream, cake and marshmallow weren't balanced; there should be a small portion of ice cream and more cake.
5
One of my favourite restaurant and glad they decided to carry on with the business, the food is great and service personnel is attentive with our needs
4
The borsch soup was awesome and the baked Alaska dessert is big enough for 6pax after soup and main course served.
4
Always a pleasant visit to the restaurant which provides something for the little ones too. Definitely worth a return visit
4
The buns served was soft and yummy!
The beef skewers was flavourful and its doneness was the way we liked it.
5
Everything was the way I remembered it. Now my kids are sold on the dishes they served. Well done. Truly a household name
5
Service was excellent. East and every staff. Food was good, desserts are huge so beware. All in all a memorable visit.

It was my first time dining at the restaurant. I learnt that as your exit the lift on the sixth floor, exit by the left door so it lead one to the main entrance of the restaurant. If you exit by the right door after coming out of the lift, you get to enter the restaurant via the kitchen.Now, the place. It was nice and clean. Not crowded on a Sunday afternoon after 1.45pm. i like the place as it is big enough and the space between tables are wide enough. very relaxed ambience. Food. I find the borsch soup - their beef soup with a small dollop of sour cream, a little over-hyped. It was not too bad, but only 2-3 chunks of tender beef and a few pieces of vegetables like cabbage and carrots. My husband and I had ordered a sirlion steak and shashlik beef. The sirlion steak was not too bad, tender enough. However, as the slice of a bit thick on one side, it was a little bloodier on the thicker side for a medium-cooked steak. The shashlik beef was also tender. It came with a side dish of pickled cabbage, some potato chunks, slices of cucumber and a stalk of chinese leek cut half. I supposed i had to put that onto my hotplate with my shashlik of beef as it came, so that was what i did.My daughter had another steak and she found it not too bad. It was tasty. My son had ordered the oxtail stew. We found it nice too, but I thought it could do with a little less salt/seasoning. But it was very soft and tender. The upside-down crab was so-so. I think the crab meat was probably from frozen crab meat or canned crab meat (because of the strong taste/smell not found in fresh crab), mixed with probably some fresh ones. Well, to take that dish alone, i think it is a bit too heavy going, and it comes with 3-4 slices of thick toast. Get that to share. The highlight of the meal was the dessert. We ordered an ice-cream with banana caramel and a baked alaska to share. The latter was very nicely done. It was a sight to feast too...how it was lighted in flame before the fire went off. We shared the baked alaska. It was good for at least 4 persons, a small quarter of the baked ice-cream each. Not a very cheap place to go to. At least be prepared to fork out $50-$70 per person, depending on what you order
3
Food is rather pricey here. Had the Shashlik tenderloin and Chicken a la king. These two dishes set me back by more than $60 and they have no promotions or bank tie ins. Certainly they are well established so they charge a premium, though you can probably find equally good steak at the same price or lower elsewhere
4
We ordered the escargot and the caviar with blinis for starters. The escargots were garlicky and buttery, just lovely. The blinis came with orange caviar. For the price, we were not surprised and it was tasty enough. We also enjoyed the ribeye steaks we had for mains which came sizzling hot. We ordered the Baked Alaska which was flambeed at the table with a "Happy Birthday" on the serving plate and it tastes just like it did 40 years ago. So nice! All in all a good dinner. The restaurant was half full on a week night and they kept all diners to one side of the dining area for ease of service, we gather. Service is efficient and effective, by that we mean, there were a few mishaps e.g. there was no sour cream served with the blinis and one steak arrived instead of two, which were amicably settled because of the nature of the servers who are like friendly aunties. The food from the kitchen is (still) brought to the table on long trolleys and a lot of a la minute finishing touches to some dishes are done at the table.
5
Totally love the place as it has quite a rustic decor. Quality food and great service! The borsch soup was really good as well as Shashlik!
4
Well-established local institution that consistently delivers good food at very reasonable prices right in the heart of town.
5
Excellent restaurant that I would love to visit again. We had the borsch soup, salmon, lamb and beef shashlik, and Baked Alaska. The latter was particularly memorable.
2
The food is worse than I remember. Nothing tastes v fresh and isn't v tasty. Not that cheap either. Better off at McDonald's.
4
Family restaurant with good old fashion menu and warm friendly service staff.
Celebrated mom's birthday here and they had 'Happy Birthday' written on our Baked Alaska!
4
Still very good quality after decades of being in business. The steaks were super tasty and the Baked Alaska dessert wonderfully sinful
4
Nice, cosy family restaurant that serves great steak at a very reasonable price. Nice to be served by the same old waiters and waitresses!
3
Love the updated look. But service remains the same, don't expect much service by the ladies still as cranky as usual. Unless you are lucky to get the new owner helping out with ur table. Steak was abit tough and I notified the boss and he gladly changed it for me. But still quality and taste of steak was lacklusture. The beef Shashlik standards has dropped, but still relatively ok compared to the new offerings of the different steak cuts. Baked Alaska still good. Borsh soup has changed slightly, too tangy for my liking. Will I return again? Sadly, no. As the memory of the good 'ol Shashlik is a far cry from this new version.
1
Made reservation at 7.45 pm for dinner.Came on time.All night was subtlety pressured to finish fast. Waitress keep asking us to clear our plates mid way into our meal (food still on the plate).Waiter even spilled red wine on my clothes. (Shirt was stained in 6 different areas)Did apologies once, but hurried and continued to clear plates.No offer to pay for dry cleaning Nor small discount.Because their tactics didn't work, they resorted to off the lights while we were still chatting at 9.05pm hinting us to leave.Elderly waitress, we understand that they want to rush home to their families and all,But seriously it was a sat night and closing time is 10 pm no?To be fair food was just ok, nothing special.Deserts were good though.Never going to return...Worse service exp in my life..
3
We had a borshch soup, shashlik beef, and escargot. There were mainly vegetable bits and 2 pieces of beef in the soup. Very expensive soup for just 2 pieces of beef. The shashlik beef is okay, slightly bland. Escargot was not as flavourful, the drizzle of garlic oil did not sip fully into the flesh. Overall, meh. Very pricey for meh quality
5
Table was prepared beforehand before company's dinner. Waitresses were attentive to our needs. Food & desserts were delicious !!!
4
The standard of the dishes is the same as before they announced their closure 2 years ago. Good-sized portions and delicious.
4
Steak was delicious,borsch was nice too,I like the hot bread served by them,will visit again to try their oxtail stew and desserts.
4
Friend wanted to eat at Shashlik as birthday treat. Pleasant family oriented restaurant. Service is good. Food was average thou.
4
The borsh soup (must have!) and chicken pozarsky are delicious. Food came quick and standards are consistent over the years.
Not kid friendly: No suitable cutlery or child seat available for my toddler.
4
This restaurant is an institution and has been around for 30+ years I think. There's a reason why it lasted so long. It didnt disappoint in terms of food and service!
3
There is room for improvement on staff service levels. Food was decent. Escargots was highly price thou. Will not return so soon.
1
The place is hidden inthenbusy orchard road, the ambience of restaurant is rather unique. Until the times up moment, one should prepared to leave punctually even though dishes not finished. As waitress will turn off the light and dragging the chair from one table to another.
5
Nice dinning place and wonderful full. Brings back memories of my grandpa's hainanese cooking. The service is very good and waiter and waitress are very warm. The bun provided is hot and nice. They gave me extra bun when I asked for more. The Shashlik signature dishes were well cooked and presented. They served in an old fashion way using a push-cart. Gives you the nostalgic feeling. Nice gentle music throughout that give a lovely evening for me and my wife. Loved the "Ah Kong" coffee just the way my grandpa makes it.
3
We have heard about this place for quite a long while, especially since this restaurant has been around for 31 years! We were rather disappointed though.We wanted to order more food but decided not to because the staffs weren't friendly or professional enough even though they are dressed like one. We have always heard that this is more like a family and old school restaurant but after their renovation, it seems to be more high classed but yet their services don't match that. In the end, we order Beef Stroganoff, Escargot, and Beef Shashlik. There are only two pieces of beef in the beef stroganoff so it isn't valued for money. The taste seems decent but it is lacking, we felt that we are paying for tomato soup. 16 bucks for 6 pieces of escargot is definitely overpriced since they didn't taste excellent. The meat was too soft and not chewy enough and also the flavor didn't penetrate into the meat. Lastly, the Beef Shashlik was decent and in fact, we can consider it the only food that was worth it. However, we were served with a side dish and had no idea what to do about it. There's half of a hard-boiled egg, onions, cabbage, spring onion and potato salad. We didn't want to approach the staff because they always seem unhappy about something. Oh and the Beef Shashlik is served on a hot plate. Doneness was fairly acceptable too.We were still hungry but didn't feel like ordering any more food. Not sure if we will visit again
3
Food standard dropped in the recent years- Soups are salty and full of MSG, the Shashlik pork was ok.
3
Restaurant with lots of history. Well documented elsewhere so wont go into it. Ordered the escargot and egg millionaire for starters. The egg millionaire was a tad dry. Seems like baked mixture of smashed hard boiled eggs and bacon filled into a half egg shell. Ordered another main stay - the Shashlik of Beef. Again a tad dry, and surprised it didn't come with any other side dishes. The hotplate seems empty without any other side dishes.
5
Shashlik is hidden in Far East Shopping Center on the 6th floor. The restaurant is very old school and offers Russian and western dishes with a Hainanese twist. I could swear that this place has been around for at least 20 years. The restaurant actually closed down and was taken over by its patrons, who wanted it to live on. It was freshened up a bit since. The waiters are mostly elderly and might be part of the former patrons, not sure. Anyhow now they use Ipad’s to take order, which don’t work that well. I had dinner with friends and we had the Borsch and a steak which I remember clearly as it was really good. It’s nice to see that some of these old fashion white table cloth places still survive. Prices were reasonable and service friendly. Actually it's a hidden gem
4
The restaurant was very old school, offering western dishes. The restaurant was changed hand and went through upgrading. It reopened with a refresh in the classical look. The place was still served by mostly elderly staffs, who now use ipad to take orders.For weekdays, there was lunch set at $16.80++ which consisted of the main of the day, soup and a choice of soft drink, coffee or tea.Borshch (a la carte $7)classic Russian broth with a Hainanese twist, served with chunksof beef shank, slow cooked to perfectionIt was served with sour cream. The soup was very rich and creamy with pieces of meats in it, unlike the watery stuff which one usually found in the cha chaan teng cafes. Although butter was served, there was no bun served with it. Not sure what was the butter served for?For Wednesday, the main course was Oxtail Stew (a la carte S$32, only available on weekends).Hearty Hainanese Heaven. Enjoy the melt in your mouth experience with each chunk of the 36 hour slow braised oxtail.The dish was served with boiled carrots, broccoli and potato. The oxtail was very tender and flavourful. The serving was huge.I ended the meal with a cup of coffee (a la carte S$4), which was strong and bitter. It just brought one back to a coffee shop. None of the modern cafe style taste
5
Quite a hidden gems. Must try items: russian beer, escargot and Shashlik signature beef! All the waiter are well-trained to deal with fire. As the deserts, drinks and foods, a lot are dealing with fire. The coffee is good. Excellent taste. Enjoyed the dinner with excellent ambient and foods.
5
It was a trip down memory lane to celebrate a family member's birthday, 4 generations having dinner at the restaurant. The biggest improvement with the new management was the service and the renovation of the place. It has a fresh look and the service was excellent. The food was as I remembered and the desserts is a must have
3
We came to experience the heritage of this 1960s Russian resturant. Despite our strong sense of nostalgic and their friendly service, their food is a great disappointment. The plating is old fashioned, cut of meat is inferior, salad ingredients are pre-sliced raw onion, low quality tomatoes with cucumber, sides are thick cut french fries and corn on the cob. Bottle of tomatoes sauce is unapologatically served. The 'Signature' Shashlik lamb in medium was overcooked, so chewy that I need extra force to cut it with steak knife, and my jaws hurt. Perhaps they used frozen instead of fresh meat. The baked Alaska dessert for two is good enough for 6 to 8 persons, a factory made mass product of the 70s. With corkage fees of $30, the bill came up to $50 per head. I wish they could improve the quality of their ingredients, focus on quality instead of quantity to keep up with the changing diet and lifestyle
4
Today I finally had a very good lunch at Shashlik Restaurant Singapore after an unsuccessful earlier attempt. The 3 course set lunch at S$16.80++ was value for money with a "Russian" Borscht soup as appertiser, a main (I chose the ox tail stew) with boiled potato and carrots and coffee/tea. My lunch partners also "added" a side dish of grilled baby ribs (for 3 of us to share) and completing the nice lunch with the signature "Baked Alaska" as the dessert. The ox tail and baby ribs were very tender and flavourful and the dessert was just awesome. Service was commendable with experienced staff. There are also ala carte orders if you prefer not to take the set lunch menu (which changes daily). Will return to try other set lunches as well
3
After reading about this old-time favourite "Russian" restaurant that had fallen on hard times and has now been revived, I decided to give it a try. Had a reasonably-priced lunch set (S$16.80++ in Mar 2017). Such sets are not the best indicators of quality, so I will probably need to go back and have a la carte items to have a fully-formed opinion. Nevertheless, the set (drinks + soup + mains) was so-so: the borscht soup was somewhat insipid, and the beef stroganoff, though not bad, was hardly memorable. Must try the kebabs the next time - they are supposed to be the house specialty
1
The staff is really nice and attentive...That said the food was pretty terrible... even if you overlook that it's still classified as Russian cuisine and has little to no resemblance to actual Russian food. Everything was super super super bland... saltless, tasteless... They bring ketchup for every dish.. but the serve nothing that really goes with ketchup...
4
Visited the restaurant after it was reopened. The renovations has made it much brighter and the quality of food remains as good. Service was acceptable.
4
I am surprised of the service that being given to me this afternoon. It is very different from what I had many months back.
It is a good serivce from those elderly waitress. Nice !
Food is good too.
Fish and chip yummy !
5
This 30yr old Russo-Hainanese restaurant is a real gem! Will come back for more! Excellent hospitality and truly Singapore style.
4
It doesn't get much quirkier than this place. Going to Shashlik is like stepping back 30 or more years in time; however, during our lunch the place was well lit, clean and fresh and the food was very good - hence the review as "very good." The place itself and the servings are somewhat simple and spartan, but i don't think it is in a bad way - just in a nice and simple way. My medium rare beef shashlik was nice and tender, and as it was served on a hot cast iron plate, i could sear each individual slice before eating. I will be going back to try some of the other dishes
3
The set lunch is quite reasonable. $16.80++ with soup, main & coffee/tea. Portion size is quite reasonable. Unfortunately there's only 1 choice of set lunch main per day. I don't really like oxtail stew but it's Wednesday and that's the only thing on the set lunch menu so I had that. It's too fatty for my liking but that's personal. The meat was well stewed and fell off the bone easily. I liked the boiled potato. It was soft and sweet. Borsch soup was quite tasty but my friends preferred the cream of mushroom. Coffee served was a nice thick brew too. Not some weak thin brown water. Quite good. We also ordered the baked Alaska $25. Very large portion. I think 4-5 people could eat it. It was too much & too sweet for 3. But at $25, it's quite pricey for vanilla ice cream, some sponge cake & meringue. Alright, that shot of Brandy costs money but not that much. My friend also ordered the baked escargot. Abit dry. And the signature dish of beef shashlik. It was tasty but $30+ for that strip of meat really isn't cheap. On the whole an average meal. Lunch set is value but I didn't like the lack of choice. Other items on the menu is not so easy on the pocket. Grilled salmon is $25. Already bordering on finer dining prices. The staff are quite friendly. Which is a plus point. Would I be back? Unsure. Maybe for a certain day of lunch which I like the meal choice. Maybe.
4
the food was delicious, and I loved seeing how the staff would prepare desserts and drinks like baked alaska right in front of them! The mushroom soup was amazing, and that's saying something because I usually don't drink soup! Highly recommended but because I am a picky eater I would prefer more details on the menu about the dishes...the meal felt quite expensive, but it was worth it
3
Restaurant was about two thirds filled on a Friday evening. My friends and I tried the soups which were good - we tried all three types on the menu.The bread was old school but soft and chewy. We tried the famous beef shashilik but were quite disappointed. Though the portions were decent but it was largely bland.Overall, the ambience was nice and cosy. Good for a gathering among friends. The staff were friendly and attentive too
3
Glad that Shashlik has re-opened after vacuum for few years.They serve a fusion of Russian & Hainanese foods.Very interesting combination.The borsch soup & the bread is soooo irresistable! So delicious that i am salivating while writing this review.As for the steak, please do try their speciality, which is shashlik beef (serve in a long metal skewer).The Baked Alaska/ meringue flambee is also a must!
5
I was rather concerned when I read a few bad reviews on the Internet before I went back to Shashlik this weekend. Personally, I think it's still a treat. Go hungry because the portions are still large and if you can't resist ordering all your old favourites like me, then you will be completely stuffed at the end of your meal. Some things I liked:1. Front of house is actually better than before. There's still a sense of it being family-like. You can overhear the staff discussing how to maximise or change the table arrangements, but the young lady in charge is friendly, and in control. The wait staff serve the desserts with aplomb, and some amusement at the number of videos taken of them. 2. They've kept the nostalgia. A lot of us come back to Shashlik because it's an old favourite. The bar counter, and the main decoration remain the same. They've cleaned up the place so the old carpet is replaced by nice wood-looking linoleum.3. The portions remain generous. The Shashlik of lamb and beef that we ordered were very large and tender. The lamb came with a mountain of vegetable sides. The baked Alaska, while a tad over frozen, remained enormous.Reservations advised, and go hungry.

A friend had suggested having lunch at Shaslik's saying that they had a good set lunch.Unfortunately, that Wednesday, there wasn't any so it was ala carte. I did not hesitate in ordering the beef stroganoff, one of my favs.Shaslik's has been around for ages and it was a treat for a dining experience at reasonable prices.Not this time!I was disappointed along with my lunch partner who had a pork shaslik.Taste was below par and servings are small and spartan.I can only deduce that the chef was new or it was just our luck to get under the radar for quality control

If their steaks are anything to go by, i wont be back. Had the worst piece of ribeye in quite awhile. No value for money there. Perhaps their shasliks are awesome (didnt try).
Heritage seems to be the only thing on this restaurants side.

Recently reopened by the late owner's sons.
There's a nice, "old-school" ambience to the place, with well-dressed staff whom have been working here from when it frst opened thirty years ago.
Food is a mix of European and Russian influences. Try the signature shashliks.

We decided to have dinner at the Shashlik for Father’s Day in Singapore on Sunday 19th June 2016.The iconic restaurant was crowded as we expected, but fortunately, we made a booking a few days before.Shashlik Restaurant closed down last December 2015, but has reopened early this March at the same location on the 6th floor of Far East Shopping Centre. Famous for their borsch (sometimes spelt "borshch", and "borsht" ); skewered meats on hot plates and baked Alaska, their menu now is largely the same including these old favourites and others like grilled lamb and chicken chop; spring chicken; fish and chips; cherry jubilee, banana split; and banana flambé.The Restaurant has almost the same look and ambiance. Dimly lit as before, with under-stated decor. The red and white checkered table cloth has been replaced with yellow table cloth. As eight of the old staff members have been retained, we were glad to see familiar faces. Also familiar were the wooden trolleys wheeling out dishes from the kitchen. In keeping with the times, our order was taken with an iPad.There was a special menu for Father’s Day, and the prices raised for the selection of items! We ordered the Borsch soup, Beef Shashlik, a Lamb Shashlik, and Ox Tail Stew. I had the impression that the tables were rather small and the eating utensils seems to be cramped on the table. The beef Shashlik was tender but a little dry. The Lamb Shashlik was also dry and slightly tough, having got a tendon in the cut I was given. This was a disappointment. The portions, however, were very adequate. Service was attentive in spite of the crowd. The staff friendly and helpful. The new owners have tried to keep the old Shashlik alive and hopefully, there won’t be too many changes and the food quality will be maintained. My parents used to take us as children, to Troika which was the original Russian restaurant, and then when Troika closed and was reopened by the staff, as Shashlik. Now we take our children, and they in turn, their children!. It would be a shame if too many changes are made that steer away from the traditional Russian-Hainanese restaurant we grew up with and liked. Otherwise Shashlik will loses it’s appeal to become just another eatery along Orchard Road.For reservations call:Telephone: 6732-6401 / 6734-3090Operating Hours:Daily: 12pm to 3pm (Lunch) & 6.30pm to 10.30pm (Dinner

This is the second time I have been in a week and I will go back again soon! The beef shashlik was cooked to perfection. Hunt this place down, but before you do, make a reservation as they DO get packed even on weekdays. The staff are attentive and old school. The desserts are made table-side and are a pleasure to watch and then devour, so leave space

This is a restaurant that is part of the rich history of Singapore. Started by Hainanese cooks decades back, it has been re-launched with new life yet keeping all the best dishes it is remembered for - Russian-Hainanese Borscht (tomato and beet-based soup with beef and sour cream), wonderful Shashlik (beef is the signature dish), chicken chop and fried pork chop. The oxtail stew is superb but available only on weekends. The desserts are highly recommended. They are prepared at the table side with a flourish - baked Alaska, cherry Garcia and crepe suzette. Service is prompt and attentive.

We made a reservation for dinner as we expected it to be crowded and it was around 90 per cent full when we arrived at 730 pm.The place has been spruced up and looks brighter than before, though the bar area and the flooring still gives it a nostalgic touch. My wife had her usual Borshch soup, which she pronounced as being as good as before, while I ordered escargots. These were meaty and covered with a delicious garlic sauce.For our mains, my wife had beef Stroganoff - while the meat and sauce were nice, the portions were smaller than we expected. I went with the ever popular Shashlik beef. Do order it rare if you want it medium, cause it will continue cooking when it is served on the hotplate. The meat was tender, well seasoned and went well with the onions, potato salad and sauerkraut, though I would wish they would be a little bit more generous with the vegetables.We did not order dessert this time (cherry flambe or baked alaska are our faves).The bread was fantastic - freshly baked and warm and chewy - and went well with the old-style butter. They were also happy to provide another refill of bread (previously, we would get stares from waitstaff), as well as iced water.All in all, it was a nostalgic meal for us, and we will be back for the great cooking again. Service was good, and generally with smiles, especially from the lady floor manager.A meal for two without alcohol or dessert was slightly north of $90

Recently came to know that my childhood family restaurant was revived by the descendant of the original restaurant staff. Decided to give it a try since the food had deteriorated when it was last closing. However, I'm surprised that not only the restaurant had been rejuvenated, the food has maintained its nostalgic flavor to its glorious past. I hope all those who grew up with borsch, shashilik steak and baked Alaska do come back to re-live the pas
3
Decided to visit this recently re-opened restaurant for a bit of nostalgia. I wasn't disappointed but the food quality received mixed reviews from our family. Enjoyed the shashlik of beef, shashlik of chicken and the baked alaska. The fish and chips passed the taste test. But the chicken posharsky was way too salty. If you haven't been back, give it a try. It may bring back sweet memories since many of the old staff are still around
4
The food quality has not changed for many years.The last time I was there was at least 1-5 years ago.the favorites are the usual, Bake Alaska are only available during dinner. The beef is as soft and juicy, it was done correctly.Really enjoy this dish.The orion soup was served warm and just right. Eat it with the soft bun provided was just haven.Good Value for money.If you want to avoid the que, just be there around 6:45 pm.The waiter does not allow seating unless the whole group is there
4
It has been quite a while since I last visited this place, and things have not changed much. In fact the decor still looks the same in the 20+ years we have visited.This is a well kept secret - they serve one of the most tender ox-tail we know. As usual, we ordered this and borsch soup with extra sour cream. Accompanying these was egg millionaire, which was nice and warm when served. Total damage is about $70 for 2 without drinks and dessert. It seems Shashlik no longer take reservations, and they don't let you in if the whole party has not arrived, and they no longer have the set lunch menu. Some of the staff are still not so "personal" but the food is still good.This restaurant will be closing at the end of the year (ie. end 2015), and according to the staff, the final date has not been cast in stone. Not many days left to visit this institution. It will be nostalgic especially for those who have been visiting this place for the past few decades.

I love the Shashlik beef - so tender and no fat! Too bad that this place is closing at the end of the year. If you are looking for a Russian restaurant in Singapore - look no further!
4
I am so surprise we found a dining restaurant in this far east building with a nice food as well.
The steak is very nice and delicious very nice ice cream cake as well.
Need to hurry and grab it now before it's to late.
1
Waited for 2 hours before the main dishes are served. Mushroom and Corn soup tastes bland. Service staff are not customer oriented. Overpriced.
Will not visit again.
3
I went to visit it because it is going to close down at the end of the year. The interior looked retro. The food was not bad but quite pricey. Overall, it is an average place.
3
One of the oldest restaurants in Singapore with long serving waiters and waitresses. Appetizers and entrees are average. Love their soft buns that goes well with borsch soup. Shashlik beef is good. Beef stroganoff overloaded with overpowering sauce. Baked Alaska available during dinner only.
3
The only attraction about this place is the ability to bring back your childhood memories.
Many of the staff are long service.
Food is average and service is slow.

I was queuing out side the restaurant on a Saturday evening at 6.10pm and there was a long queue already waiting for the restaurant to open for dinner at 6.30pm. While waiting I was reading other Tripadvisor reviews on how bad the service, quality and food was and was half contemplating to leave the queue, but I was glad I didn't.I ordered beef shashlik ($32), chicken kiev ($25) and the baked Alaska ($24). The main courses' portions were a little small for the price they charge but the taste and quality was not bad. The highlight was the baked Alaska, where they set a little Aladdin lamp of rum alight and poured the magical blue flame over the meringue ice-cream cake. Woah! And it tasted really good too! I was served by the aunty waitresses who were quite pleasant and weren't rude or grumpy or what. The wait for the food was long though, I had to wait 1 hour 15 minutes. But they did put a sign up at the door to manage expectations that the waiting time is 1-2 hours. The meal cost $95 in total (very pricey!!) for the three dishes. There's still the cherries jubilee I wanted to try, I might just come back to try that. This restaurant is not as bad as the other reviewers make it out to be. And since we know the place is closing at the end of the year, it might be worthwhile to try it out, at least for the baked Alaska (only available during dinner)
5
This restaurant has been around for eon. love it's borch soup and pepper steak. service is not tip top but, to me, the attitude of the service staff here gives this place its character. Personally, it is a pity that they are going to close by end of this year.

I ate at this restaurant almost 5 years ago, and i remember the steak to be awesome and well seasoned. Went back today and ordered the fillet steak for my missus and Shashlik of beef for myself, we asked for medium and medium rare respectively. When our steak eventually came, it was dry, blend and was almost well done. Upon calling the waitress, all we got was, "If you order medium-well to well done the steak will be dry, as long as there is a little pink its medium". The waitress was trying to give excuses and suggested that we add mushroom sauce to the steak (to cover the dryness of the steak). Yup that's how bad the steak was.Come on, i have had well done steaks which were more succulent than their "medium" steak. And $28 for that fillet of steak, not to mention a really small portion, was really really disappointing.All in all we spent $100, for 6 escargot, fillet steak, shashlik of beef and mushroom soup. None of which tasted like the shashlik i had 5 years ago.Good bye Shashlik,I think closing down will actually save your reputation, whatever is left of it

Went to Shashlik as I heard good reviews about it and also it served chicken kiev. We went for a Saturday lunch and it was fairly empty, around 5 tables of diners- quite surprising as it is located in Orchard Road, but it is on the 6floor afterall.The restaurant is quite big, but the decor is somewhat dated. I ordered the 'imperial' chicken kiev and we also has chicken chop from the set menu and a side order of garlic bread.Given the small number of diners (less than 20pax), I was quite surprised it took more than 30 minutes for the mains to be served (after the entrÃ©e was cleared) - and there were no guests who arrived after us.My chicken kiev portion looked quite huge until I realised it was sitting on top of a huge wedge of fried bread. It came with curly chips and a really small portion of (over)boiled vegetables. I didn't really enjoy the dish as there was too much fried items, and not enough vegetables - I wouldn't mind a side of fresh salad for some acidity. And it isn't cheap- more than $20 (before taxes and service charge).It's unlikely I'll head there again anytime soon
3
Back again after many many years. What's same is the interior and 'feel'. Otherwise i was astonished at the small food portion. Also, the taste was not as yummy as before. It was disappointing and there is no pull factor to revist.
5
I been here for more than 5 times. Ambience had not change. Order a grill salmon and shashlik beef. Food was awesome. Borshch soup was good too. Will come again.
5
As the name of the place says order Shahslik... and I always do, borscht soup and crepe. These are the main items I like and would recommend to others.Service is typically prompt and to the point, it does lack the 5 star feeling, but as long as I get my food on time and taste great... no problem for me.Other items I like are the cherries jubilee. I have been visiting this establishment for many years... way back then it was called troika but in a different location . So my review probably is biased. Then again when I do bring new guest they seem to enjoy it too... especially the shahslik steak and Borscht.
5
Combining the number of years I've eaten here, and my parents before I, will put this restaurant at more than 3 decades old. And it has never failed us once in these 30 years.Their steaks are flavourful, lean, yet very tender. Probably one of the best steaks I've ever had. The accompanying coleslaw is amazing - it isn't mayonnaise ridden, instead made with vinegar and sugar, thus tasting very light and compliments the meats very well.Shashlik's escargots, on the other hand, I am sure are the best in town. I've tried almost every other escargot offered in local restaurants, as well as bistros and cafes all over France, and I have to say that Shashlik's always remain at the top. Amazing flavours, with copius amounts of melted butter and fragrant herbs.For photos and the full review, head over here: http://www.chocolat-et-basil.com/#!Shashlik-Restaurant/cmbz/AEC2066E-EFFB-4B8E-8C46-C6D8E0EA48A

How sad to see the once legendary restaurant become so mediocre and uninspiring. The beef, which is the crown jewel, has no taste and look unappetizingly placed on a piece of hot plate. The only saving grace is the nice soft buns that costs close to nothing. Bye bye Shaslik. Rest in Peace.
1
Food is ok, and the waitress who took our order (who seems to be the only decent one there) was candid and honest that their oysters are frozen. Every other server there seems to hate working there, hate people, hate their jobs, and hate everything that is going on in their lives. This is tolerable until the older gentleman who works there decided to throw the bill in front of me, gruntled a 'HERE!', and disgustingly instructed me to 'SIGN BOTH LAH!' before a sarcastic thank you. It took every ounce of energy I had in my body not to say something back. PLEASE DON'T BOTHER EATING HERE. LET THEM COMBUST INTERNALLY. THEY DON'T DESERVE TO BE OPERATING A SERVICE
2
I arrived with impression of the food should be very delicious but hence I still order the lamb chop that costs me $28 before gst and service charge, when it arrived i was a bit surprised it looks just like those that served at Ashton with at least half of the price, please see the photo i attached for the lambchop, i ordered additional bread/bun and it turns out to be in quality that sells on sengsong $1.20 6 in 1 pack local buns, it wasn't that good for the price i paid, I believe it was round 50 cents or $1. with drinks and soup and my total bill is over $50. if the taste is delicious i do not mind to pay such price but it wasn't, it's just average food you get in Ashton but double the price and with $50 I could have gotten a nice buffet in a hotel. My advice, go to ashton need not to pay so much for food in this level

Brought my family of 7 for a boxing day meal. Was surprised to find the famous borsch soup portion reduced patically. Out of 3 bowls, 1 was also filled lesser. The mushroom soup is normal. Jacks place serves better escargots and cheaper ones. You cannot just change something that is so familiar to your old customers cos its likes short changing them. The buns which used to be free now cost $50 cents a pc, the soup which was once a larger portion now reduced patically. When I was there yesterday there was no crowd unlike years back there was a waiting q. If you guys at shashilik are listening, better wake up. Consumers are not blind and with social media these days, bad service and shortchanging can spread like wild fire. The meals are not exactly value for money now that its all reduced portions.
4
The ambience is noisy and the furnishings tired. The service is brusque and impatient....but this restaurant has a faithful following! Hearty fare cooked by Hainanese chefs - Russian Borsch soup is a flavorsome comfort food; chicken or pork chop or sirloin steak are house favorites. Make sure you leave enough room for the Bomb Alaska or Cherry Jubilee desserts.
1
We went for dinner on tuesday 24/sept/2013, ( 3 pax) although the food was good, the service was real real real bad , so what if the food is good ?? the service was damn bad, the waiters and the waitress was seen standing in front of the bar counter,we have to wave frantically each time we need something, the way they speak to us is as if we owe them a living, they look so reluctant to serve us , we spend S$ 143.00 and we thought of getting back at our 10 % service charge.. i will never never step in there any more, many good food around ,not necessary to pay and be face by bad service !!!!!
4
The ambiance was definitely good with its dimly lighted lights! Yummy garlic butter escargots. Shashlik steak was with no side dishes except a plate of salad but it was so flavorful you wouldn't need any sauce with it :)
3
We were brought to this restaurant by friends. The cooks apparently, are from a Russian restaurant way back in the 1970's. They still produce the same borsch soup, which was very good. Their buns came warm and fluffy. Food is quite literal.Steak comes as a steak, plain and simple, vegetables came mostly undressed, to the point.Its an old world feeling...almost like being thrown back in time 35 years.Prices are very reasonable, and for what it's worth, it was a pleasant trip down memory lane
4
Personally I don't really like to eat steak. The smell and the taste just don't like it. Most steak I took is either too hard or smelly. My first time there was my birthday which my wife brought me there. I was like what? I don't like steak still bring me there. After tasting the steak, I tasted the best steak I ever had in Singapore. I will only eat Shashilk. Other steak in Singapore I will not try. Worth the price you pay for. Definitely going back. I went back the second time, standard is there. If you are looking for nice ambience, that might not be the best place. For best steak, it worth goin
2
The restaurant has a funny ''old'' furniture smell. Indeed it's deco hasn't changed since the 80s.The employees look like they have been working there for a very very long time. Not very friendly I would say. We had 1 set lunch and 1 Shashlik beef. The salad that came with the Shashlik beef was very pathethic. I don't mind paying more for better food. However, my verdict is that for the same price I've paid for this meal, I can definitely enjoy better service and food quality elsewhere. So, I shall not be coming back here unless they change. Not recommend

I revisited this restaurant with my husband on Valentine's Day. I called in to make a reservation, but was told that they don't take reservations for the day, as it is first come first served. Probably due to the special occasion, the restaurant was very full. We managed to get a table. However, the waiters were too busy. They gave us bread, without the butter, until my husband reminded one of the waiters. We ordered the usual dishes- the Borsch soup, the half dozen escargot, half dozen oyster, the shashlik beef, and the baked Alaska. We haven't been to the restaurant for more than 2 years and were quite shocked that they have changed the portion of the Borsche soup from a bigger portion to a much smaller bowl. Also, it took 20 minutes to 30 minutes for each dish to be served. So we figured out that we might not go back to this restaurant on another special occasion.  My rating is more to do with the service of that night, and not the quality of the food though. Also, the e-mail address of their website is an invalid one. I tried sending them an e-mail for the reservation, but it bounced back to me as failed attempt. :(  Our total bill had also increased. Probably we are not aware that they raised their prices, since we have not been to this restaurant for a long time. The last time we were there was on the X'Mas Eve of 2010
1
Unfriendly, rude staff, reduced portions and quality of food, increased pricing probably sum up my latest dining experience at Shashlik. I will miss the buns, Shashlik beef, and Borsch soup. Good bye Shashlik! You have successfully managed to destroy the very good name you worked so hard to achieve
4
Have been to this restaurant for a long long time. My parents used to bring us here when we were still kids. It's quite a wonder that this restaurant is still around. The food is good. The beef shashlik is well cooked and succulent. The chicken and lamb shashlik are also very well cooked. The escargot standard can vary quite a bit, from nice tender to rubbery.. So really depend on the chef. The waiters and waitresses were old hainanese uncles and aunties. Not the friendliest, but can get the job done. So since I was young, some of the staff were already there. There are now younger staff.. Better service and definitely more friendly. The decor in the restaurant is quite dated, but well it gives me a homely feeling.. Since it brings back nostalgic memory of childhood, there with my parents. A place to go for the shashlik, and to experience the old school services.

My boyfriend & I went with 2 others to Shashlik. I've never had such good Russian cuisine in Singapore. Since we were raring to try something new, we decided to see if this restaurant was really as good as the reviews said. We were impressed.We filled our tummies with the Borsch soup, Shashlik, Baked Alaska & Irish Coffee. The soup was savoury & thick with pieces of beef, Shashlik was tender & uber juicy. The Baked Alaska was made in front of us & served after our waiter divided them into 4 shares. The Irish Coffee really packed a punch
3
It was a birthday dinner celebration for my boyfriend, with his mum, sister and a good friend of his plus galfriend.His sister had earlier made a reservation which was a good thing because i noticed the restaurant was crowded, despite being located in a quite ulu (deserted) shopping mall. We had escargots, salmon, pork chop, shashlik beef, fish and chips, sirloin and rainbow trout.Portion of the mains were decent, but the salmon and fish were alittle too salty. Pork chop is tasty but the patty could be slightly thicker as we found it quite thin. The shashlik beef was nice nice and tender though. No complaints on the service, but some of the service staffs are getting on years, hence you'll can't expect them to come to you very quickly etc. We also ordered desserts like Cherry Jubliee and some others.. it was quite a sight watching the waiter preparing the cherry jubilee as the waiter is literally flaming up the dessert right before your eyes. While it was fanciful and quite a show, the dessert is nothing more than two very sweet scoops of vanilla ice creams and some cherries. Expensive dessert i would think. You may want to carry with you a dry shampoo or perfume to rid the food smell once you leave the restaurant.Nice ambience though.. anostalgia feeling once you step in. I may consider going back for a second visit when i'm feeling nostalgic and alittle rich
3
A friend and I went to Shashlik for dinner.We ordered the escargot appetiser, the borsch soup, the shashlik, and the baked Alaska. The escargot was tasty and a little tough. The borsch soup was thick and very salty. The shashlik was tender and delicious. The baked Alaska ice cream cake was nice and creamy.Service was attentive and much better than previously. Gone were the rude and grumpy Hainanese waiters.The old charming decor was still there. Only issue with ambience was the strong smell of food when we walked into the restaurant.In short: good food, better service than previously, and reasonable prices
4
Love the ambience and hoow dignified the service staff are. The food is decent enough but for those who have never visited a russian restaurant, this is a good start
5
Inexpensive.. good quality steak with a colonial touch to it.. I like the food and ambience here. Great baked Alaska as well
3
Ol School surroundings and even the staff are mostly aged 40 and over. Good meats on a stick.
4
Great Russian food, esp Bomb/Flaming Alaska
3
The old serving folks are still here, so be prepared to wait your turn
3
Good old estb. Love the waiters. And the baked alaska, of course
4
Not so bad k.execp that they really need to go enblock the place...he3

Hi - some friends had mentioned Shashlik to me, and had been meaning to try for a while. I went for lunch and had a stable Russian Chicken Kiev which was very tasty. I asked them for the beer menu, and despite only seeing tiger and heineken on the Menu, the waiter informed me that they had a new Russian Beer called Obolon, which i ordered and was the highlight of the meal and worth a visit just for the beer. It came in a 500ml bottle and served into a cold glass - perfect with the Shashliks or chicken Kiev!

2 weeks ago my family went back to Shashlik Restaurant at Far East SC for dinner. I was really apprehensive about going there because of the bad reviews and the infamous ancient Hainanese waiters from hell. The last time I was there, about 2-3 years ago, my family dined with fear in our hearts. They just snatch the menu from you after you order without a single word.The old waiters were so rude and unfriendly and we could hear smashing of cutlery and shouting from the kitchen. There were no smiles, no thank yous and of course no pleases. It was traumatising to say the least. It seems that we were all there for free food and so had to tolerate the extreme nastiness.However, this time around, there seem to be a great turnaround. the old plump waiter greeted us as we entered and when we were not ready to order, he said no problem, take your time and even the tall aunty tried her best to force a smile and the old uncle was still shuffling around. I looked around to see whether there was a camera crew filming and was relieved there were none. I noticed that there were a few younger service staff and they were OK. I guess they may have rubbed some courtesy dust on the older ones or there were some changes in the management. Also, I guessed that the No.1 nasty waiter, a small wiry guy was not around. Either he has retired, sacked or passed on, it was all for the good of the restaurant.The food portion was small but very good. The lamb and beef were succulent . fragrant and very well marinated. The borsch soup was a bit disappointing, the colour look brownish and lack a bit of punch. The Bomb Alaska dessert was the high point of the evening and never fail to bring smiles all around. Averagely, we spent about $40 per person, which is quite reasonable.OK, folks, don't be afraid anymore. The big bad wolf has gone and you can now all go to Shashlik. Don't go, for just the good food but also experience the old world charm both of the decor and the players. It was a hilarious evening for me
4
Shashlik has been around for ages, and has always been at the same spot since I can remember. The food is quite good, particularly the shashlik steaks off the skewers onto a hot plate, the borsch soup with a dollop of cream and the bomb alaska dessert. The restaurant is Russian by theme, but was and is staffed by Hainanese waiters. Expect some attitude and brusqueness from them. Service level varies, so go prepared to take the 'coolness' and slow service
4
Borsch soup and baked alaska!
4
Nice bosrsh soup n steak! Yummy. Nice oldie ambience with old staffs too! hahaha.Need advance booking, always full.
3
Its more hainanese than anything else. Reminds me of the Coliseum in KL. Grumpy waiters make up part of the experience...
3
Decent Steak
4
very retro ... good makan esp the meat on a skewer ...
4
old school steak house. great steak! but dun expect much service. must also try the desserts
3
Iconic Russian restaurant owned and run by Hainanese chef and waiters. Basic service, but worth visiting for the experience. Famous dishes: Borsch, Shashlik of Beef.
3
Borsch soup is the saving grace...otherwise, service is crap.
3
Can I say horrible, horrible service?
5
One of my favourite- try the beef shashilik and borsch soup. If you are lucky, can order the bake alaska which is normally sold out.
