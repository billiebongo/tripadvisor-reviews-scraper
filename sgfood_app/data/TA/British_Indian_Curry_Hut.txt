Food is excellent in a good atmosphere in the centre of Holland Village. New tables and bar stool area outside creates a better drinking atmosphere
Good friendly service

We ordered Paneer amritsari and vegetable seekh kababs. Paneer amritsari was yukky paneer pakoda with smelly oil and seekh kabab was not tasty at all. Never again I will order food from there😡😠

Curry Hut on Lorong Mam Bong in Holland Village, Artfully presented Indian fare, in between fine dine and a pretentious night in town! The food was great, flavorful dishes served up in seriously generous portions. Some of the food that we ordered, such as Vegetable shish kabab, Chicken tika masala, Chicken pakora, and Cheese naan set complete with a helping of poppadum’s were all excellent. But overall nice atmosphere, and nice food .The waiters and staff was fantastic, they presented flawless service, friendly and professional. The attentiveness and enthusiasm of the service made for an enjoyable, evening. Great place for a real Northern Indian cuisine. Definitely must try if you are in the mood for Indian flavors

I had to visit to get the taste of amazing mango lassi and so many mocktail blends. Must visit place, especially during the evenings when the road is closed and the tables are set outside for a good evening. And get the perfect taste of indian Cuisine

I am still recovering from sticker shock after my bill was delivered. We stopped in for a Mother/daughter lunch & shared one main, two apps and a side of rice & naan. Appetizers were listed on a board without prices. The Tandoori Gobi and Chicken w/ Chuntney Kabab were good and generous but were brought out in slow, random order so we ended up taking the last one home. Things were well spiced if mild and seem to be made fresh to order. It was a slow lunch. My teenager got antsy and took her lassi to-go. I stayed on to enjoy my chai and Holland Village people-watching. Then came the bill. The appitizers came up as random mains as they are apparently not keyed into the register. So they sell them as apps but price then as mains??? My fault as I didn't. I assumed they would be in the same general price range as other appetizers rather than priced as mains. To their credit he quickly reduced my bill by 20% (bringing my review up to 4*) when I brought it to his attention. Plus a 10% service fee is added. So in the end it is a very spendy little lunch. Good, but spendy. IMO they should up the decor & staff level to match the price. Food is good quality and it's a good spot in HV for people watching. Note: Open air so fans/ ac/ shade but also natural breeze

Came here with the family for a Friday night meal. The staff are lovely and the place is comfortable although the toilets are pretty bad. Overall the food was ok. The curries were pretty good, the garlic naan was very crisp and tasty and the "smashed aubergine" was good too. The onion bhaji are to be avoided. It's effectively a think slice of red onion, batter and fried to within an inch of its life. It's greasy and unappetising (at least they took it off the bill). Same can be said for the "kids menu" chicken wrap. It's not really a wrap, but rather a greasy Indian-style bread of some sort. It's filled with lettuce (despite asking for without) but very little chicken. Oily and tasteless...not something my kids will eat. So, some of us enjoyed our meal, but won't be rushing back.

My love for Biryani has been always there, but the uniqueness in the way it's severe in Curry hut is truly amazing. Nicely chopped lamb and well steamed rice with the yummy curd salad. This is taste of paradise, most popular dish here. Give a try.

I went to The Curry Hut restaurant at Lor Mamong with my mum for a quick lunch. It is located in a very chic area of Holland Village. The restaurant itself was easy enough to find, being just two minutes away from the Holland Village MRT station. It has a lovely facade which makes you want to go there and eat!When we entered we were immediately greeted by the staff and I was actually quite pleased with the responsiveness of the staff there. They seated us and we ordered two Naan sets. The food took some time to come but it seemed to be freshly prepared. The Naan set which we ordered included four pieces of naan per person, a cup of biryani rice, some paneer butter masala, channa masala and dahl. The food was delicious (really, no exaggeration). I especially liked the Paneer butter masala. It smooth, creamy and tasty. The portions were good and we could barely finish, we were so full!The ambiance of the restaurant is also quite nice. Nice decorations, lighting, etc. There's also a bar in the restaurant for those who want to buy a drink but the place is also family friendly. We spoke to the manager there, Mr.Sona and he recommends we try the Fish tikka, Chicken Jalfrezi and Malai Mushroom Tikka. There are plenty of delicious options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. A popular time to visit this restaurant is generally on evenings and weekends. The staff were very courteous and helpful. It was nice to see how pleasant they were and they treat customers well

I don't know how you can make bad curry in Singapore. But they manage it. I had a lunch special. Weird, sweet, sightly chemical - tasting curries. The naan was smothered in some cheap butter substitute that left a foul aftertaste. The whole meal left me thinking that I wouldn't like to see their kitchen. Avoid.  
4
We visited this place after reading reviews. The street that it is in is almost like a pub street but don't be put off. Once inside the restaurant is clean and airy . We had the lunch special, popodoms to start followed by butter chicken, rice, lentils and Nan bread. It was delicious, loads of nice flavours and a decent size portion. All for $12.50, a bargain. We would eat here again. The one downside.....the staff could at least look a bit enthusiastic about their job!
5
As I am so much for the taste served by curry hut, I just keep coming. This time I did not miss to taste the yummy Dahi papdi chaat.. everyone must try it ! Worth a Visit.
5
We joined friends here as one of their usual haunts, food was excellent, tasty good quality and great service, shame we keave today or we would go back , in Holland Village close to MRT transport best indian for years.
4
Very good food for the lovers of Indian food. The food is balanced with just enough proportions of spices and oil to make it taste good. The restaurant closes at 11 pm and sometimes they don't have enough seats to accommodate. To enjoy, be at the restaurant by 9pm. Itwould be safer to have a booking before arriving to the place
4
I work near by and tried this place for the first time last night.They had everything we wanted on the menu and it was pretty reasonably priced. Holland Village isn't the cheapest place to eat, but it is a nice vibe! I went with some friends and we had a mix of food! Really huge starter portions and lovely curries. The service and atmosphere was great
3
I have eaten here 2-3 times, the latest was for a lunch meeting. The food is the chicken biryani was good and large enough to serve two. The lamb korma is pretty good as well. In general the food is quite decent and the staff is friendly and helpful. The venue itself is not that appealing, but don't judge a book by it cover. It will continue to be a regular on my dining list
1
We had eaten the restaurant a little while back. It was good, we really liked the food and the service. But when we went back about a month ago for a take out, wow what a big different. We did not order the same food but we did not think it would be that different. We ordered Mutton biryani. It was expensive considering what we got. We did not even finished it. Do not think that we would go back again
4
Curry Hut opened in Holland Village a couple of years ago, the staff are friendly and fun and the place has a real family fee. It's a good place to go and sit outside for a drink if you're not hungry but if you are then the food is excellent and the portions are substantial so make sure you have an apetite! This is definitley one of my favaourite curry restaurants anywhere - enjoy
4
We went to this restaurant on recommendations from others and I'm glad we did. Set in the heart of Holland Village it's appearance may not be "all that" but don't let that put you off - there is nothing fancy about the place a mix of tables inside & out gives a choice of seating areas but it is clean and airy.There is a great menu choice with a good mix of chicken, lamb and vegetarian dishes. We chose onion bajji, vegtable samosa, pilau rice, plain naan, lamb korma (described as smooth as a baby's bum on the menu LOL), aloo saag and lamb dopyaza. My husband enjoyed the samosa's but the pastry was a it thick in places and looked like it had not cooked properly. The onion bajjis were OK (husband wasn't keen tho). Everything else was lovely - freshly cooked and good portion sizes (just enough). The rice had caramelised onions & peas in it which made a lovely alternative. Both lamb dishes were tasty with a decent amount of sauce and meat with the lamb cooked just right. The naan bread again was just the right size, it wasn't the normal style of naan that I'm used to in the UK but it was very tasty.Unfortunately the sprite I asked for was flat (obviously came from a large bottle which had been open for a while) but it was changed with no problem and the waiter was very apologetic.Total for the food, 3 bottles of Kingfisher lager & 1 sprite was approx $150...average for Singapore. Overall will definitely be back

I have never been a huge fan of Indian food outside of India, but I certainly fell in love with food in this place :)We live nearby and this place is our favorite restaurant for dinner in the area. Gone through quite a lot of dishes on their menu and loved all of them (Aloo gobi is my personal favorite)!Seating inside is a bit dull but outside is perfect as you get to enjoy the buzz of Holland Village. Highly recommended
4
Been here a couple of times now and been very satisfied both times. For a start they have happy our drinks all night (1for1 wine etc). The menu is extensive and offers good variety of choices. There are plenty of mild curries and a good amount of hotter options depending on preference. I'm not entirely sure how authentic it is as some of their spicier dishes aren't off the chart spicy, but the food tastes great and that's good enough for me. Particularly enjoyed their aloo gobi and keen to try some more of their veg dishes. Definitely my go to curry place in the area now.
5
I love the Biryani of curry hut a Lott, especially the way it's dressed with the covered naan ! Truly authentic ! I would come here again !
5
I decided to treat my friends to a different Indian restaurant, other than the ones in Little India, and found this amazing place on tripadvisor! Yummy starters, esp the chaat and mushroom fry!
4
Curry Hut does awesome north indian curries, at a much more affordable price than high end indian restaurants in Singapore. You can request for particular spice strengths (mild, medium, hot), but beware the hot is really hot. The staff are also nice and know their menu. Food is definitely worth tryin
4
Who can resist the buzz of the dining precinct at Holland Village when the lights and the music are on? We dined here as a three generation family of five and it was excellent.We shared a variety of vegetarian and meat dishes and the tastes and spices were just right. The naan in particular was one of the best I've ever eaten - even in India!I had a hankering for a soup and took the spicy tomato - it was top class in taste and texture. The service was prompt despite some large groups demanding attention. The drinks were reasonably priced, so overall a very satisfying dining experience
5
We always come here for our curry Wednesday with my partner. Each time , the food just gets better and better. I would say it is worth the price . The staff is also very accommodating and would extend to fulfill your request for the food. Will definitely come back for more
1
We ordered Chicken Vindaloo Curry and requested for the spiciest level and they obliged to cook it but they will need around 30 minutes which we have no issues with. Clearly they were understaffed! The bar counter was a mess and we can only see 3 people running around in the entire restaurant. We came back after 30 minutes and asked where our food was. The lady cashier then realized they had served our spicy vindaloo to another customer!! Poor fella who ate it if they cannot take too spicy. She then told us to wait for 5 mins and the food came out. We rejected it immediately as we were skeptical as to how a food that needs 30 minutes to cook, can be cooked in 5! It can be somebody else's leftover that they had cook previously, otherwise they may cook ours in a rush & compromise the quality! We requested for a refund. Very disappointing as we were excited to try it given we love vindaoloo curries and had it at a few places. I think the management need to look into hiring more people and clearing out your bar counters too as it wasn't a pleasant sight to see. I wouldn't dare to drink my cocktails if I've seen how the bar counter is.
5
We live about 10 minutes away and this is our go place for curry in Singapore. The food is fantastic!! We have never had a bad meal here. The service is fast and friendly. If you like beer they serve it ice cold which is wonderful is the heat. Highly recommend.
1
Been to the curry Hut last week . The food as well as the service was pathetic . It seems we wasted the money on such food . We ordered dal makhani and malai kofta . Though they stated malai kofta in the specialty , however it's really taste bad . It's very hard . I guess they need more trained chefs to make Indian food . The ambiance of Holland village is nice , that's the only thing we enjoyed 
4
We almost thought the restaurant was shut on Sunday afternoon as all the alfresco tables and chairs were stacked up. Walking through the glass door was greet and we were the only diners and took the window seats. We ordered the garlic naan, butter chicken, the cheese peas and basmati plain rice. The naan was baked just right and very crispy with springlering of garlic butter and chives and in a 1 feet length piece, never seen anywhere else for such a big one. The butter chicken was good, but the cheese peas was even better. As for the basmati, it's like anywhere, you can't go too wrong with it. As our appetite has gotten smaller with age we did not try dessert or the lassi.
5
We visited this place recently twice. Both times the food was excellent. They use spices that we have no chance to see in Europe or Australasia. Tamarind sauce is great. Naan bread is perfect. Lamb korma and Chicken Tikka Masala were fantastic. Do not forget to try Mango Lassi it is very good too
5
The spice balance is perfect, never before have I tasted such excellent India food in Singapore. Their vegetarian dishes are sublime. My new fav place for Indian food
5
Best indian food i ever tasted. Definitely must-go. Service is extremely prompt and friendly!!! I ordered the lamb tikka, butter chicken, cheese naan and fish curry. They were amazing!!!! Not a fan of indian food but this place changed my opinion of indian food :-D
5
Super taste and excellent service. Nice hotel love to go with my family and friends. Excellent environment.
5
We had tasty and hygienic food in " The Curry Hut ".. The hospitality is very good and varieties in food is awesome.

Awesome service and ambience ..
i loved their starters.
5
Amazing ambience , quality service , very delicious Indian food .. Would like to visit again and also recommend my friends to visit here for the best Indian food ❤️ cheers
5
Food was so delicious.Mainly the service they provide is very good.Wish to have tandoori roti and paneer butter masala again and again it was delicious.Trust me I will suggest everyone to visit this place..👍👍👍
4
We visited the place on a Friday night. At 730pm, there were a number of available tables. We ordered the saffron rice, Kashmir pilaf, palak paneer and a fish curry. The saffron rice was enough to share in small portions and fluffy, evenly cooked and lightly salted - fantastic! The Kashmir pilaf was fragrant, thankfully not as sweet as the service staff had cautioned. Curries were generously portioned such that you could have one as a main with your rice. By 830pm, customers were filling up the place. Service was a little tied up but with a bit of patience, we got our glasses refilled and requests attended to. A pleasant experience overall
5
My best food experience was right here in the curry hut. The service and quality of the food was brilliant. I enjoyed a lot eating the food in there. I hope and wish that I once again come to "THE CURRY HUT" for more delicious food. #brilliantfood#mustcomeagain#thecurryhu
5
I will like to thanks for curry hut entire team the service was given by as excellent and the food was very testy Specially Tandoor platter and lamb biryani, Goan fish curry was delicious.
Must recommended value for money.
5
Awesome food in good price....They have lot of veg options...Staff was really nice. Will visit again for sure.
4
quality restaurant . Very good food . The frame is a bit dated but the whole is good.
The different curries are very good and varied.
5
Food was so delicious. Service is good. Wish to have dinner again and again in this place. Can't take my hands off the plate. Trust me! I will suggest everyone to visit this restaurant by hook or by crook. I'm 200% sure you guys will love this place. I bet you'll enjoy having a great supper! Good price with quality food... Check in here my friends. Hurry up!
5
I visited yesterday by reading the reviews.. Wanted to try long time! Hopped on a weekday, we ordered for shabnam ka palao as appetizer . It was mouth watering with impressive presentation.. Then punjabi samosa was hot crispy and spicy.. Simply moved!! Though it was weekday, most of the tables were occupied so busy place.In main dish we got for mutton rogan josh naan set for 4 people. Mutton was moist and juicy! Loved the set menu as it was all tummy full .. with naan dhal combination simply delicious.. Awesome Must try lunch set menu for office people working nearby
3
Went there for weekday lunch and tried Set Veg lunch. It was disappointing. Restaurant was empty during peak hour and only one table occupied by a small group.Set lunch had 2 veggies, 1 lenthil (Dal) and 1 biryani with Naan. Food was not fresh, mix veg looked like last night one re-fried.Biryani rice was Stale..we could smell it and it tasted like had been made atleast a day before and spoiled. The waiter replaced it with plain rice with apologies.We also ordered Gulabjamun (sweet) and they gave us microwaved one...Service was polite but food was below average. Would skip it
5
My first visit around Holland Village and didn't realise the hidden gems in this area behind the main road. A good range of bars, cafes and restaurant. I saw 2 curry restaurants, and the other one seemed a little quiet, but it was a Wednesday evening. Walked past the curry hut first time and then had a look at the menu. Good range if food and not too expensive. It was quite busy but was easy to get a table for 1.I wanted tio try the onion bahji, but told the portions were big, so settled for a lamb dopiaza, with rice and garlic nann. Indian beer served by the bottle, and had poppadoms, complimentary.The curry came with the rice and the nann together. Its good to tell how good the curry place is by the way they nann is cooked. This was done well, and could tell they used the super hot clay ovens. Curry was very good, lamb wasn't tough or chewy. On the menu, this dish didn't have any chillis next to it, so expected it was not very hot and quite mild. But it did have a kick to it, and my experience with dopiaza, they tend to be spicy.Service was great and friendly, and just in case the curry gets to hot, unlimited water is given throughout the meal.Overall, a nice curry and inexpensive. Thumbs up
5
I am very particular with Indian food personally. It is not my go to cuisine. Well but the review of this place is pretty good plus it is near by. So we stopped one day for lunch. And oh boy it was awesome. The lunch set menu was reasonably price and in generous portion. The mutton curry was very tasty and the tandoori was very nice also. After a very satisfied lunch experience, we came back for dinner. And for sure it didn't disappoint us. Had an awesome dinner. The chicken dish appetizer, sadly i don't remember the name was exceptionally good. One thing about the Restuarant though was the price. I must say though it was in a higher price. For two of us, an appetizer, two main dishes and two beer came out to be about 70sgd or so. But again very good food. Would come back again for sure.
5
Wonderful dopiaza and pepper chicken, both are absolutely delicious. The butter chicken isn't the nicest I've had but still enjoyable. Great naans and the sweet mango lassi is amazing, you must try it. Service has always been very friendly too, which if you know Singapore, is an absolute bonus
5
Yum! Fantastic. We went for a mix of curries and starters to share and each of them were very good especially the Tikka Paneer and the Chicken Jalfrezi. All of the curries will very aromatic and spicy, but not spicy for the sake of being spicy. The service was attentive. This place is in trendy Holland Village but is slightly of the beaten track for tourists and is clearly a favorite for ex-pats and Singaporeans
5
This is a place to go for curry and nan. The nan available in Singapore. Light, not doughy. Curry was delicious and not spicy until you cannot eat. The butter chicken was good. The okra curry was fabulous! Simply the best!
3
Its decent given the prices but the food can be better!
Can give it a try!
Nice place, pleasant ambiance and decent service
4
The location is electrifying. People here are experts in making every dish "Wow!". Great staff and beautiful aura!!
5
A good lunch......need to visit this place once again.....good service and atmosphere..😉😉😉😉😉 best food ever ..😉😉
5
Easily some of the best curries I've had in Singapore, if not the world. Absolutely beautiful food served with a smile and in a great spot for a post dinner drink or two
1
I have no idea how this place gets such high ratings. I ordered a takeaway this evening and the food they delivered was stone cold, the lamb dopyaza was dry, chewy and full of fat. The chicken kebab was just awful. Do not eat here, a total waste of $50
5
We were a sucker for lonely planet recommends in Singapore, they didn't fail to deliver quality food. This place was no different. Located in Holland Village, a bustling street with this gem. Food was excellent, same sort of price we were paying at other quality eateries. The service was great and the food even better. Wasn't much left after we were done
4
We were a group of 10 people visiting the Curry Hut for a team dinner. We visited on a weekday. It was almost empty when we reached around 8 PM. The place has a very simple dÃ©cor. Good lighting and comfortable seating space. As the name suggest, they serve wide variety of curries. The menu is a good mix of Indian appetizers, soups, main course and desserts. The quantity and quality of food is very good. I tried 2 vegetarian curries with breads. My colleagues tried fish and chicken curries. We all loved the food along with our special guest from Europe. The service was decent. At times there was a slight delay in serving the dishes. I guess its because of the size of our group which could have contributed to this. I will definitely visit this place again in future
5
If it wasn't for Trip Advisor, we'd have never found this place. Its a bit out of town, but the area (Holland Village) is well hip, has some good bars and a great variety of restaurants. The food at The Curry Hut was awesome, (Lamb Saab and Bhindi Curry with accompaniments) which my wife believed rivaled any other we've tasted elsewhere. Staff was attentive, warm. Prices are right. We're only here 4 nights for the F1GP, but we may well repeat as opposed to partaking of the mediocre fare of Boat Key
4
We have been long time favorites of Samy's. Have been going there for 2 decades!!! But then comes along this small restaurant that genuinely gives them a run for the money. Authentic, flavorful and generally some of the best curry I have tasted. All our favorite dishes tasted wonderful. You will not be disappointed
3
Nice food
Good service
Restaurant atmosphere ok
Probably more 'hip' at other venues in holland village
Would visit again if in area
5
Excellent Restaurant with fantastic service
The best place to have get together.... All varieties of food are available and I really enjoyed the atmosphere.
5
We planned for a nice lunch after the fasting we had done, so we were looking for a nice Restuarant. Tripadvisor was helpful in showing up curry hut ! We had an Amazing meal, so happy to have visited here !
4
Nothing short of excellent. Curries, beer, wine, naans - superb! Staff was really top notch. And the people watching from the patio - well, who needs to be entertained by an electronic devise with all that action. Incredible!!!
4
This place was a short drive from hotel, by taxi. We went there so we could try the curry and compare to other places we tried on the road. The yellow curry dish was good. Not too big of a place.
4
Food here is amazing, great value and the staff are very attentive. We were very happy with our visit here. We left very happy.
5
Visited recently with my Saudi friends, they had never tried Indian... Where else to go when we have "The Curry Hut". Never miss their Biryani !!!
5
Loved this place, great value and delicious curries, the naan bread was excellent and they had indian beers too, i recommend the mutton curries most of all and the bindi as a side dish.
5
Best Indian in Singapore. No doubts.We tried two different types of curry and their samosa.It was great. Everything was great.The staff is very friendly and they even gave us a discount (don't know why).Even without discount the price was extremely cheap, if we consider the quality.We will certainly eat here again
5
This place is delicious and service is really good! I went with a friend and we got seated outside on a Friday night and were able to enjoy the holland village night life! Food was delicious! We ordered the palak paneer and a chicken curry dish! both were delicious! The service was amazing as well. Our waitress was prompt and very helpful! definitely recommend this place if you are looking for delicious food in a great location! Lots of bars around for late night drinks afterwards
4
We enjoyed food and ambience and really amazed with the service.Service was exceptionally awesome. 👍👍👍
4
I wont have to think twice that its the best curry restaurant I have visited on my trip to singapore. It seems like they use alot of herbs which give a very distinct flavour to its curry.,
5
as veggies. this was a great place to eat and so cheap for singapore where most things seem to be really expensive
5
Some of the best curry I've ever had. You won't be disappointed. Service was also superb. Constantly made sure we had everything we needed. Will definitely come back.
5
Perfect meal, I brought few of Arab Nationals, they all loved the food! Requested for medium spicy, now the food was a perfect mixture of quality and taste. I would strongly recommend it
4
Stopped by for a quick meal.
Happy greeting.
Good Menu with big selection.
Vegetarian dish's
Service fast
Good tasty curry.
Was happy at the bill for 2
Value for money.
5
Three things that make a great restaurant. Food service and atmosphere. The Curry Hut on Holland Village nailed all 3. The outdoor patio in the centre of Holland village is perfect for people watching. The service was great, treating me like a guest not a customer and the recommended lamb dosh was delicious. This place deserves the high rating it gets. Can't wait to go back with friends
3
Encouraged by TA reviews decided to give this place a shot last Friday. We had reserved a table but we did see a few patrons stroll in around 9pm and find seating easily. Whilst we were waiting for our friends to join, the wait staff came and asked if he can take the menus away, upon telling them that we're yet to order, he still proceeded to take them away, I found that odd. Anyway, once the friends arrived and we were ready to order, it still took us 5-10 mins to get the wait staff's attention. We skipped the appetizers and went straight for the mains, I did get a Mulligatawny soup which wasn't as per my expectations. The soup was too watery and lacked flavour. However, it took them 1 hour to bring our main course which I found simply unacceptable. All dishes thankfully arrived at the same time. We had ordered lamb curry, yellow lentils, cottage cheese in buttered gravy and white rice. The food was palatable but nothing to write home about, I've had better in Singapore. Even the fresh lime juice wasn't up to the mark. Given the service and the average quality of food, I won't be coming back in a hurry
5
I'm not a big fan of curry, but I have to take that back because this Authentic Indian Curry is superb! Amazing service and amazing food! We ordered 1 Vegetarian Curry, 1 Lamb Curry, and 1 Cheese Naan. The server even made some alternative for out Lamb Curry to make it more easy to eat :) The server always look up to our table an clean it whenever we have an empty plate. They kindly ask for our opinion too!New favourite! Definitely coming back to this wonderful Curry Hut
5
Looking for a new place for our Sunday night family dinner, we came across the Curry hut and decided to give it a try. Friendly reception, courteous and attentive service and best of all, delicious food at a reasonable price was what we encountered. All the dishes where mildly spicy, but even our fuzzy kids had to admit that it was very tasty!The mango lassi is recommended as well!Definitely worth a try before it gets too crowded
5
this is more than a place for food. the drinks are served with charm and warmth. try sitting out alfresco on the pedestrianized road on a cool evening. great place to meet up with friends.
4
Curry tastes good, try it. Various of food to choose, don't miss the chance of trying. Cost is not expensive. Affordable. Serving fast and friendly.
5
Really nice food with great service! Enjoyed my meal with my friends! Will be back some time with my friends again.
5
Very nice food and service. Good ambiance throughout the dinning.Enjoyed the variety.Friendy staff .
4
I had been there for dinner with a friend who was craving for Indian food, specifically Butter chicken and we weren't disappointed with what we got over there ... We tried the Veg Samosas while we had a couple of beers, they serve fried papad's when you sit at their tables which i feel is a nice touch...The chutneys that they serve are quite nice too, i tried 3 varieties and all of them were really tasty (Mint/ Mango/Tamarind) ...The service there is a tad bit on the slow side where you have to actually keep looking for someone to take the order which shouldn't be case when its such a small joint ... However they do make up for that with their smiles and pleasant demeanor ... Butter chicken and butter naans were to die for, i am hardly had such tasty indian food outside of india ..
4
We went to this restaurant after reading all the nice reviews on Tripadvisor. We were positively surprised by their curries, which were flavorful and served in generous portions. We also had the paneer pakora as a starter - also good. The staff was nice and competent.The restaurant decor is quite nonchalant and unappealing - it's not a place for a romantic dinner or a special occasion. But the flavours are worth the visit.There's happy hour until 7:30pm - wine and beer only.Outdoor seating is also possible, in front of the restaurant
5
First time visitors to the Curry Hut. Staff were friendly and offered excellent service. Glasses of water were poured as soon as we sat down and we were given some poppadums to nibble on. Our order was taken promptly and our drinks served straight after.The curries were delicious, Murgh Makhani and Chicken Tikka Masala, served with Garlice Naan and rice, yum! We will definitely go again
5
The curries are all beautifully flavoured and all distinct. You can really taste the spices and herbs that make up the marinades and sauces. Main courses about $20-25 - but it's worth it.Sit outside - inside is ok, but wouldn't like to be at the back
4
Their food is good & their biryani, Indian-style biryani, not the Malay Indian-Muslim briyani, is great. It's cooked dum in its last stage, & unlike other dum coverings which get thrown away, you can actually eat the dum covering here which is made like butter naan. This for me is their claim to fame & that & only that gets them the 4 stars. Location is holland village. Nothing special about the decor or even the restaurant layout (which isn't nice actually). The bar takes up the prime seating area. So if the road facing tables are not free, you sit on the side or are pushed to the back of the restaurant. The decor is bland but totally livable with. Service is not bad but not consistent. Some servers are great some really need to be in other business

We love the food - full of flavors and spices but not greasy or heavy as you would expect of a traditional Indian meal. It's authentic yet modern. The restaurant is located in my favorite neighborhood in Singapore, Holland Village, which is full of live at night. So if you have dinner at The Curry Hut, you can have a pre or post dinner drink at one of many bars with live music to complete the night

I have made several visits to the restuarant, I am used to tasting different varieties! Curry hut has always given me different options to choose from! Worth tasting all their dishes 👍👍

Very nice flavours, excellent and wide ranging menu, melts in your mouth. Friendly service. Will definitely be back.

Had dinner at this place. Food was really good. We requested it to be spicy and it was done in the way we wanted. We ordered about 6 items and the price came up to $104. Prices are quite steep.... but what can you expect at Holland V. Guess their set lunch is cheaper
5
I happened to travel to Singapore on a official trip from Saudi, i was excited about the country itself, and also its food. One of my friends suggested to go to Holland village, and i could see many options for my dinner and i opted for ''The curry Hut'' I would say truly worth a visit and i strongly recommend it to everyone
5
I cant resist from coming here on by 2nd trip to singapore this time with all my colleagues.We started with dahi papdi which is all time favourite and my favourite mocktail. Then came the naan and butter chicken which is the finest here. Biryani made my day complete. I would highly recommend people to taste the food of high quality and taste only at curry hut
5
We visited the curry hut following reviews on tripadvisor and it didn't let us down.The starters were good and yes the onion Bhaji portion is large and we were warned !The curries were full of flavour, garlic naan isn't on the menu but they were very happy to make this for us.The staff were very friendly and helpful.We would return anytime we are back in Singapore.
5
Be it the service or the lovely atmosphere they maintain in the restaurant.. everything is just perfect !!! If you're a total foodie like me and you're looking out to give some delicious treat to your taste buds....Don't wait a minute...Just dash into the Curry hut... They have Variety and Taste..!!! Wanna keep visiting this place...Their food has got me addicted..!!

I usually switch various restaurant to experience different taste. But i got addicted to this 'THE CURRY HUT' restaurant. Whenever i go Singapore this is the only restaurant i opt for.. Great taste and excellent service. Feels like HOME.
5
This is my 1st time to this restaurant, I will appreciate the great service, i really loved the taste of fish and other sea food moreover food taste was excellent and I will highly recommend this restaurant.
5
I visited the curry hut couple of times during my 1st visit to singapore. Truly amazed, located at a important party place. A person interested to party and eat good food. "The curry hut" my best bet !
5
Just loved the taste of the fishes they served here. And all my family members were satisfied with what they had. I would prefer this to any family for lunch/dinner. Indian masala at its best. Cheers..
5
Never did I think I would be eating such a good Authentic Indian food here. The taste was absolutely good. A classy restaurant. World class service. Decent rate. What more can I expect??
My whole family was satisfied! Had a great time here.

This is a good, not very good and. Not great restaurant. Three of us had lunch here and were the first ones at the restaurant when it opened. Only one other customer came in the next 90 minutes.
5
I happened to visit this restaurant when I visited for admission at the NTU, because someone said holland village is the most happening place but I truly wanted some indian food ended up in "The Curry hut" I would say truly the best ever Ala-carte dinner I have ever had! I love butter naan a Lott, had that with Butter chicken my all time favorite dish!! Now I like it better here and surely will visit as soon as I join as a student ! I strongly recommend it to everyone !

We visited The Curry Hut on a weekday evening, the place was deserted and we were the only ones. The staff was friendly. We ordered a sev puri for starters & palak paneer and cheese nan & plain naan for main course. The food was served quickly & with a smile. And thats where the good part ends.The complimentary papad served was raw & of poor quality. The chutney served along with was clearly poor and stale. The sev puri was prepared with low quality ingriedients and made with mashed potato that seems like it had just been taken out of the fridge! The puri was stale and reeking of oil. Moving on to the main course, the paneer was rubbery and did not taste fresh at all. The cheese in the cheese naan was completely tasteless. The naan was really thick, not at all what you'd expect it to be like. As for the service, nobody asked us if we liked the food or if we wanted anything else. Mediocre at best. Maybe they were having an off day or maybe just plain careless, but I will not be going there again

We eat Indian food once a week, and this is our 'go to' place, both for takeaway and for eat-in. Ate there tonight in fact, and my Bhuna Gosht and tandoori roti were as good as always. Special mention for our waiter, who was super-helpful and stopped us from over-ordering - he was dead right: one portion of onion bhaji was more than enough for the three of us.Well-worth a try when you're in Holland Village, and great to sit outside and watch the world go by
5
The restaurant is offering top quality of cuisines.The flavours and spices are the highlight of taste I guess.Perhaps that's the reason which made me write a review here.Hope my review would encourage to continue your best service always.My special appreciation for the interiors and the songs played..:)U guys made my day..!Cheers.

Centrally located, this joint good authentic food. The ambience is pleasant, staff is courteous and service is excellent.

Enjoyed a delicious fish pakora starter (crisp, spicy batter and tender fish) followed by the best chicken tikka masala I've had since leaving Glasgow - also had a lamb gosht that was rich and had a decent bit of heat without being overpowering. Mopped them both up with butter naan that got the chewy/fluffy/crispy combo just right. Saffron rice was a little insipid and the poppadoms tended toward the chewy side but other than that - absolutely spot on!
5
A place to have best Indian curries. They have replicated the proper Indian flavors and taste in all the dishes. The servings are enough for two. The way they serve foods, is really attractive, they take much effort to give a good look to their tasty dishes. yet they served us in right time, we really appreciated them. A good food, with good service in a good place with good environment. We enjoyed it
5
I visited the restaurant with my friend for lunch. All we could say is the best choice for Indian cuisine is 'The Curry Hut'. The dishes served were delicious and had been prepared with utmost care and cleanliness. We had a warm welcome and experienced the best service from the staff. The serene environment deserves to be mentioned. More than the worth, I paid. If you prefer to have good food, should make your choice to be here
5
The best curry we have had in Singapore over the past 3 years. This is quite the find, in the heart of Holland Village. The food is truly exceptional and after searching for a great curry in Singapore, we have finally found it. They have a house speciality lamb dish that is like the equivalent of a rendang. Their nan bread is more like roti, thin and crispy on the edges, soaked in butter. Delicious. Recommended highly!
4
The food is delicious and probably the best Indian cuisine That you can find in Singapore. The modern style is inviting and the staff is very, very friendly. Itâ€™s clean, so its not one of the typical run down Indian restaurants. Good value for money with contemporary and friendly surroundings. This place is a must go for all curry lovers in Singapore
5
Wanted to have tasteful curry , palak paneer and I got what I wanted. Curry was smooth and made of freshly grinded spicies with experts so end result was delicious. Top this with great service from the staff, I truly enjoyed my dinner. Will come again
5
The food is delicious and probably the best indian cusine i have found so far i singaporen. The modern style is inviting and the staff is very, very friendly. Its clean, so its not one of the typical run down indian restaurants. Definetlly a place to come again
5
I accidentally happened to get in to this restuarant seeing its beautiful entrance, and also lot of multicultural people. When i came to know they serve indian food, i was even more happy. Hot and Spicy mixed vegetable with butter naan was my favourite. I saw many other options which i will try next time i visit ''The curry Hut'
5
Craving an Indian curry we were not disappointed. We went to 'The Curry Hut' and had a delicious meal. A warm welcome and a complementary Indian street food starter followed be a fine selection of very tasty dishes. Good value for money with contemporary and friendly surroundings.
5
My husband and I visited last week. Great location, good value and a great team but most importantly the most exceptional Indian food we have ever tasted. You MUST try.
4
Outside of the city's Little India, this place hits the spot for that curry crave. Spices are complex and well-balanced. I particularly like the Murgh Lamb and the Butter Chicken.
5
Had their biryani. Finally had the authentic dum biryani I was looking for in Singapore.
The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. The ambiance is mordern and perfect for Holland village.
This place is a must go for all curry lovers in Singapore.
5
One of the best restaurants I've ever dined in. Incredible experience and most of all food quality and presentation. The owner was sooooooooo SUPER NICE and helpful to help us going through the menu. I am a picky Italian when It comes to food and I totally got conquered by this restaurant. Everything is good, so you cannot go wrong. Their curry sauce is to die for! Please you cannot leave this place without the pistacchio-icecream dessert! All the staffs there are super friendly as well. Just awesome for a very good price and without the rush of typical Singapore restaurant!It might take a little bit to deliver you the main courses since they are all hand-made at the moment, so I would suggest to get some appetizers and their AMAZING NAAN
5
Based on reviews, we tried this little Indian gem last night. Had a group of 8, that are hard to please, as they believe they are connoisseurs of Indian cuisine. Everyone said they had had the best Indian ever...it was all so good! The staff were attentive, led by the owner Basha. Will definitely return before we fly home
5

We had Lamb Biryani, butter Naan and Chicken curry for dinner plus onion bhajis for starter. There are various methods for cooking Biryani which are unique to different regions of India. The one served in this restaurant is a "dum" Biryani in which the rice and meat are cooked in slow heat. The Biryani was covered with a Naan and once you cut through the Naan you can smell the soft aroma of the spices. All the dishes we had the right amount of spices and the taste was just perfect --not too overwhelming as they could be in some Indian restaurants. Just to add that most if not all of the dishes are cooked in North Indian style. Everything seems to be made fresh. Though the food arrived a bit late, it was worth the wait. The staff are friendly. The prices were reasonable, around S$20 for most dishes. The restaurant also serves beer, wine and hard liquor. The only downside is the poor acoustics of the building. If you sit inside and the restaurant is busy, the sound of people talking could be overwhelming. We decided to sit outdoors which was fine, but it would have better if there was a fan installed outside similar to other nearby restaurants

I had a brilliant meal here. The food was delicious and the family have been in business for many years. It is easy to see why , their food is authentic Singaporean and delicious
4
I like the chicken curry which is not too spicy served with diet coke. The environment is clean with good service and the price is reasonably cheap

If you are looking for good Indian food , then I would strongly suggest this place. The taste and service was good .

Delicious Indian food. Hospitality was just great. Very friendly staff and absolutely value for money. A place where I will go back to next time I visit Singapore.
5
the best place for Indian dishes with proper Indian taste, the restaurant has a good interior look and provide a good food service. A better place to visit again and again.
5
We followed a recomemendation and very happy to endorse it. Easy to find in Holland Village, a spotless, sharp yet welcoming environment. The food is excellent. There were four of us and we shared a Chef's starter for two plus an onion Bahji. We each had a main plus rice, vegetable s and breads. The food was plentiful but not overly so. All the dishes were well presented and appetising with the bhuna Gohst a favourite. One of our group chose chicken tikka and this looked and tasted great.The restaurant is very good value , including the beer, and we boosted our bill with a bottle of house sauvignon blanc. We'll be back
5
The service and the food was excellent with some of the best Indian Food we have ever had. It is situated in the lovely and lively Holland Village which was full of bars and overall had a great vibe on a Saturday night as the road was closed off. Great night out overall
5
This place is extremely good for a very good authentic India good. I never expected to get such delicious Indian food on our 2 days stop over at Singapore. We ended up visiting the place again for a family get together. The ambiance was very good and the place was very family friendly. Hospitality was excellent, waiting time was very less and price was very reasonable for the quality and taste of the food. It was a very pleasant and a very memorable evening. I would definitely visit this place whenever I come to singapore and I would also recommend this to my friends who are in Singapore

We are here now.. Vegetarian Day. The biryani is spectacular... Moist and flavorful especially when you bite into cardamom! Beautiful tandoori veg platter, nicely burnt at the edges. By the window and people watching on Lor Mambong on Sat night. Basra is so cool. And the house pour is one for one
