Found this place in entertainer app I was around. Decided with my friend to have a try there. Cosy place if not crowded. The Korean burger is really nice! Will come again another day to try other food.

Returned here for another visit last week for a coffee after lunch nearby. My cappuccino was served at the right temperature and was strong, as I like it. A good choice and worthy of another visit in due course.
4
We visited the cafe on a weekday evening. The food was good - pizza and pasta. A band started playing some nice, relaxing songs. Cosy atmosphere.
4
Nice place to do work / chill with friends; spacious + high ceilings + came on school holidays so it was really quiet!
5
This is a beautiful place to catch up with friends and do work. Free and fast wifi is available, with ample power plugs.
3
The atmosphere was quite cosy and there was a band playing good music. The food arrived promptly and was quite ok.
4
Came here for icecream and coffee last week after lunch in the general area. Really quite decent gelato and the coffee was good too. Service was a bit haphazard, but there's a good atmosphere and it wasn't too busy.
5
The atmosphere is excellent for one person or as a group. The sofa seats are comfortable. Quality of main course, beverages and ice cream is good too. Recommend eggs royale, earl grey cocoa and pistachio ice cream!

This cafe is located within LaSalle and naturally attracts a lot of students. They have good coffee, food and gelato. The ceilings are quite high, making the cafe seem very spacious. The seating is a mix of tables and couches, with many people camping out for hours at a time. The food itself is decent, nothing too special but affordable prices (especially with the entertainer app). The gelato is also included on the entertainer. I think the highlight of Lowercase is the selection of coffee and desserts. This cafe would be a great place to come for a tea/pastry break.

Food is normal. I wasnt told that there is private movie screening. Me and my friend have lesser sitting selections. When we were in the cafe, the waiter is very helpful in explaining and how we can go about ordering and collection. We ordered pasta which we think the servings is good for petite girl. Taste, theres room for improvement
4
We had spaghetti and waffles. Nice chill place with wifi so we could get some work done as well. Will be back.
4
We ordered the set lunch (oven roasted chicken) but it's quite salty. We asked for some cheese to go with the fries and the staff kindly gave it to us for free.
5
We had steak loved it. Very nice ambience too, the students at Laselle are so lucky to have this cafe in their school.
3
The restaurant was a good place to chill with Live band but not a conducive place to study as they dim off the lights
4
Had a really lovely cream mushroom with smoked salmon penne! The choc milkshake was unexpectedly rich too! Best of all, there was a live music gig by a local group, sugar icing on the cake I'd say!
5
The lunch set and pasta set r really value for money. The portion is also sufficient for one person. Gear place to hangout
4
The new management took over and introduce better food and coffee! Great work! Dont miss the pizza and pasta!
4
Nice, laidback ambience. The music duo (EWM) was decent. Some exotic beers are also available and decently priced too, but I opted for the 1 for 1 offer on Asahi beer pints.
5
Love the music and food there, we reached when the live band started playing and we love the music they performed. Not only so, the food there was perfectly made for us, especially the chicken and the pistachio gelato, we strongly recommend these dishes üëçüèª

Have been to Lowercase on few other occasions and loved their desserts and drinks, hence decided to bring a friend there for the mains. There was this pasta set promo going on so we ordered a prawn aglio olio and mushroom aglio olio.... not sure if was coz of the promo but the portions were rather small, barely good for us who usually don't eat that much in the 1st place, Taste-wise, they were really good though! As for the iced early grey aloe vera and iced berries tea we had, we were really sorely disappointed as both were really diluted... I had to feel rather sorry for my friend for recommending this place as we walked out still feeling rather peckish.... The service was good as always though...
4
quite a good air-conditioned place to chill. food is ok. can be crowded on the weekends. good for group meetups!

A bit overpriced
Free wifi which was good
Layout nice and spacious
But smells of fried food stick to your clothes
‚Ä¶............,,,,,,..

The spaghetti bolognese was great. The latte came with nice latte art.
As for price, there were 2 different prices for students/staff and public.
Price for public was on the high side.
Free WIFI is provided.

I went to this place with my friends for my birthday brunch. I wanted a place which is not very crowded and no restriction on who long you sit. I like the feel of teh place with transparent full length glass walls.

Crispy pizzas & Fantastic SpaghettisTopped with a good choice of ice cream and beer coffee tea...Craft bottles and draft Asahi...reasonable prices and amazing ambienceMusic was snazzy.Seats were to die for...Really AMAZING!of course - the staff... what more to make the place a Gem...cheers

If you like lots of space, this is it. High ceilings and well-spaced tables but chairs a little too high for the tables. Didn't have space to cross my legs. The pasta and tea set lunch is decently priced. I liked my prawn aglio olio enough to want to come back. Will probably try the all-day breakfast and coffee next.Staff at the counter is friendly and offered the wifi password without me asking. However, this is an entirely self-service establishment. Order and pick up your food at the counter. I did wonder if I'm supposed to clear my dishes too, as I didn't see the staff coming out to clear the tables. Nonetheless, I like the fact that I could get some work done here without much disturbance

All the food is overpriced and not tasty at all. But I like the environment (despite the AC always blowing too strong) with the chairs and sofas. Free wifi is available is you are willing to post on social media that you were there. Staff at the counter is friendly and coffee is not bad. But I don't recommend this place for lunch or dinner

The advantage of being the only restaurant in an arts center is that it enjoys full houses on theatre nights. So, for two consecutive nights, my partner and I found ourselves eating in this food and beverage establishment. The concept is self-service and the team members stood behind the counter. I am thinking a few of them could have pulled themselves out of the counter to clear the plates from the empty tables. Instead, I see some patrons making do with dirty plates on their tables, presumably belonging to the patrons who occupied the table before them.The food was western with a focus on Italian and the portions were acceptable for their prices. The banana strawberry smoothie I ordered on the first night was a little watery, compared to my partner's banana blueberry; and could be served a little thicker. The mushroom aglio olio was also too salty. The second night's dishes did not fare much better. Although the calamaro spinaci was perfectly cooked, I wondered if the cartilages in the squids could be removed. The mushroom soup was also a little watered down. I loved the crunchy bits of mushroom pieces though. I have no complaints about the bolognese, which I enjoyed on both nights. A lesson learnt is that one should not take advantage of the situation. Step up on the standards and the crowds will come, not just on theatre nights.

I accidentally stumbled upon this cafe after my visit to SimLim Square. I found the decor to be amazing and refreshingly different and a menu that was so diverse. It has a diverse option from snacks, mains, coffees, cakes and milk shakes. The Oreo Milkshake was heavenly and the fries with multiple dips was very good. The service is quite good and it has even a play house for kids
