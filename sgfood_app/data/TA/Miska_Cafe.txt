Food was not bad, just slightly overpriced. Environment is great, perhaps thatâ€™s why the price hike.

Excellent Saturaday hand out. Great food, nice atmosphere and very friendly staff , Christine, definitely will come back again.

Food is pretty good - delicious Aglio Olio. Arrabbiata was strange with olives but sliced beef was very good. Eggs Benedict was not worth the $21++. Smoothie was alright. Waffles are meh. Wonâ€™t pay $16 for doughy thick limb waffles w just vanilla ice cream. Buffalo wings are more like fried chicken wings (kfc can do better).Waitresses donâ€™t look like they wanna work. For both times that I came. There was one other waitress who was the only friendly and sincere one. The rest - gotta buck up.Beautiful ambience and this place is not hard to find - once up the carpark, youâ€™ll see it.Great selection of food (not only Mediterranean). They even have all day breakfast.

It was late weekday evening when we visited Miska. Took a short drive from Equarius hotel to the QUAYSIDE to find food. Parking was $3.12 after 6pm. For 4A1C, we ordered appertisers such as Casear Salad, Truffle fries and hummus (served with pita bread). For main course, we just did with 2 hawaiian pizzas. My elderly dad was such great spirit that he had the $5 white wine (1 glass) to go with his food. Christine from Miska was generous to allow him a wine taste before he selected. The hummus was so good that we simply licked off the bowl. Not to mention the special concocted chili oil to go with the pizzas.The ambience is unparallel, quiet and uninterrupted. Great Spot to chill out during a weekday night in Sentosa!! Will come back again

We were staying at the W Hotel nearby and just wanted something simple, yet tasty to eat to contrast some of the delightfully mad street food encountered elsewhere. My family all loved the food - I especially enjoyed the spaghetti in olive oil with grilled chicken and parmesan. It is really hard to make a simple dish taste excellent, but it was so lovely I insisted we come back a couple of days later. Yum

The menu fits well with the theme. Lots of options. All items are made by the chefs. The sauces, the wraps, the pizza dough, the salad dressing. All made in-house. This wholesome and homely foods is just perfect for my tastes considering every other resturant nearby tries to be too upmarket whereas Miska appeals to those who appreciate foods normal and cooked perfectly. The chef is also flexible and will listen to customers needs. Living in sentosa makes this place easy to access. I take all my guests to Miska and they all love the food. The owners take price in the decor and staff training and always trying new items. Once I got a taster from the chefs of an item they want to try on the menu. How awesome is that. Other restaurants at Quayside Isle are okay but Miska will alwsys be my favourite. My faviritr dishes:- eggs Benedict breakfast - halloumi cheese starter- spicy lamb wrap - lamb bbq pizza (my creation)- salmon fillet- fish n chips- eggs white breakfast wrap- pancake tower- every side salad is beautifully arranged.

Waiter refused our request to swap fries for pasta on a kids meal (our other child ordered pasta so it wasn't like they had to cook a special batch). Deserts were served 15 minutes apart so some of us were waiting while others ate. Some dishes were really bad, while others were ok. Won't be going back and suggest you avoid this place as there are many similar cafes within 50 meters.

Somethings every foodie will love with Miska. A fantastic variety menu and the fact everything is made from scratch. I mean everything including their spixy sauces and salad dressings which are super tasty. This visit skipped the delicious lamb kofta wraps and we tries the Mexican chicken burrito. Super tasty Mexican flavours. The Norwegian salmon was cooked to perfection. Melting moist flakes of delicious salmon on top of sauteed slices veggies. What a good choice. The best part for anyone who enjoys good food, is the miska serves perfect food on every visit. With the great food is good service. The team here really does a great job and the owners have really kept this place special. Looking fwd to another visit next week.

Always planned a visit down to W Hotel and its surrounds.Last evening it became possible and so glad I did.Walked along the marina...lots of people - both locals and foreigners - were seen walking past the row of shops that front the marina...including residents of the yachts as well as maids walking doggies.Spotted this little cafe with their expansive menu displayed outside.Decided to do a Veal version of Donner and Rice , coupled with a Lemon & Mint Refresher.Loved the minty taste of the drink . The mashed hummus on the rice together with the 2 dips that came with the dish was great as well.Next door is a bar. cafe runned by Indians and on the side, Greater Lot by Cedele...possible new concept by Cedele.They also have a Jasons supermarket for the residents of the marina, residences and the hotel. As an aside, did not like the vibe or the decor of this W Hotel. too tight spaces...even for the kitchen table. Guess the star would be the expansive poo

The eaterie was empty when we arrived but quickly filled up. We were the only Singaporeans. Because of this and the view of the marina, I felt like I wasn't in Singapore. The waitress were attentive and helpful when we wanted to shift tables so that we could have the boats in our photos. The portions were huge for us. The food was delicious but were slightly more expensive for Mediterranean fare. We throughly enjoyed our lunch.
5
Organised a dinner get together for my company. Food was great and service was fantastic. Would actually come back again.
3
Affordable and great place for weekend brunch at Quayside Isle. The staffs were attentive, friendly, and helpful. However, the restaurant has a open concept with no air-conditioning. It is only applicable to people who enjoy eating outdoor.
4
The service was good, the staff is always ready to help. The view is nice with people walking dogs and good for family outings
4
Ordered carrot orange juice and spicy chicken doner. It was really delicious and the fries as well. ðŸ’ž
5
got to Sentosa fairly late, these guys served us dinner and the servidce and price and food was spot on.
5
Nice little cafe tucked away in Quayside aisle.. Great location overlooking the Sentosa waterside with parked yachts, bustling ambience & great service with a smile !!
Food has really good variety & food is served fast.. On our regular list now !!
4
Solid value, great view right on the harbor, good prices. Just wanted quick dinner and selected the sampler which had great protein and selection of sides. Low cost wine and bottled water and solid priced meal.
5
Nicely priced. This time I decided to skip my usual lamb kofta wraps and tried the pizzas. Margarita and bbq chicken. Both were just perfect. Tasty and topped up nicely. Felt like american style pizza but for sure it was Mediterranean. I asked for something spicy. They didn't have chilli padi, but they gave chilli flakes, chillie oil, and the spicy sauce... Enjoyed dunking the crust into the spicey sauce. I will for sure order the pizzas again. Ps all was takeaway so didn't have to pay the 10% service charge :-)
5
Last few weeks visited 4 times and ordered takeaway too. Every meal was just lovely. Hearty food so it's not pimped up for display. Service staff work hard to please even offering to change a dish when it wasn't the type of sauce we were used too. Dishes I like are:- Lamb kofta wraps (the spicy sauce, the lamb balls, and the wrap bread are all made in house. And feels so home made)- Pasta with pesto sauce (pesto is not the creamy type but in olive oil)- Breakfast wrap and eggs benedict (served till 5pm, how nice is that)- Lemon and mint drink is my favorite. (Just deliciously sour and refreshing). - Just had their pancakes, which were lovely too. For sure will return. They get busy at peak lunch and dinner hours on weekends. And sometimes on weekdays. But feel free go order to pickup by self. I did see deliveroo pickup too. Enjoy this hearty gem in Sentosa Cove's Quayside Isle.

So, I was walking along Sentosa Cove restaurant row looking to pick out a restaurant and the lady hawker persuaded me to come in and try Miska. Greek salad was "ok", but I made mistake of ordering grilled prawns. The heads of the shrimp were black (not from grilling) and the eyes were shriveled. On shelling the shrimp, the meat had a mushy layer inside the shell. I should not have eaten them, but I was hungry. Frankly, the cook should never have cooked these "aged", shriveled prawns. I was very disappointed
5
Most of the staffs were friendly and attentive. quick service. chillax environment. food was not too bad too but think can improve their pancakes cause it was too dry.
5
Is good location with nice view and the service also excellent and hopefully I will come back again while i visit to Singapore
4
We had dinner tonight and enjoyed a walnut, cranberry & chicken salad and a wrap. The food was excellent and full of flavour. The service was also good. Would recommend this cafe
3
We have had our breakfest there, nice cup of koffie and really good fresh fruit drinks.
We had egg benedicts 2 different ways and all of the eggs could have cooked better.
Overall not to bad.
2
We settled for Miska because Kith next door was full, expected something good but turned out so so. Should have known when the waiter couldn't even pronounce their wine names properly and these are not complicated French or Italian wines.
5
The place is part of a resort development and has a very nice outdoor area overlooking the yachts Marina. They actually bake the wrap bread so you get that oven fresh taste of bread. I had the spicy chicken wrap. Apparently they never freeze their chicken so this maybe the reason it tastes so good. The spicy sauce was amazing. Something unique in my opinion
4
The place was rather empty when we went there in the morning for breakfast while the next door Kith was packed and with a small crowd waiting for their table. Miska's food selection was reasonably good and the service was prompt. The prices were reasonable for a Sentosa Cove eatery and the food quality was up to standard. Will go again to try other dishes

Rented a bike in the city and headed to Sentosa. Great safe bike tracks around and had to award myself with some lunch and a drink. Found this Miska cafe having all day all week promotion on $5 glasses of wine and though good for a cheap cycle day out, but in a top spot overlooking the many million $ boats moored here. Ordered small dishes of hummus and halloumi cheese at $31 only to be told the special wine offer only applies with a main course.....nothing mentioned on the promotion board.....The hummus was dry but the halloumi was soft and perfectTwo star for a $67 lunch that should have been a cheap day out.Anyway ready for my bike again and new adventures are calling - not a bad day after all !!
5
My husband and I enjoyed the food and service along with the scenery. The staff was very friendly and made sure our food and needs were met immediately. Jiawen made this all possible with his prompt attention and service. The food was excellent. We will return many times. Thank you Jiawen

I've had some bad pizza in my time and this one was right up there with them. My margarita pizza was a sorry specimen indeed. It looked as though it had been cooked a week earlier, left in a cupboard and then microwaved (to room temperature ). It was dumped on a plate before me by an unsmiling waiter whose clipped English came across as very rude.Also drinks and dishes arrived separately so we could not enjoy our food together (even if it had been delicious - which of course it hadn't ).To seal off the night, as we were having fun chatting the waiting staff dropped the bill in front of us and started dismantling the nearby tables. It was 10pm on a Sunday. The next door restaurants will still buzzing. Shocking
4
The view of the sea and yachts is really nice. Selection of food is decent. They have very reasonable wine and beer promotions.
3
Had a short walk after W hotel. The cappuccino was good but unfortunately the short black coffee (S$ 4!) tasted like burned beans - not to be compared with a coffee in Italy or Vienna.
3
Limited breakfast menu but otherwise looks quite reasonable. Decent portion. Steak slices and hash brown a little salty though. Overall ok.
4
I have been to Miska Cafe a couple of times and i found the place Good. Enjoying the wine and the food with friends on a weekend evening away from the City rush was a good memory. The Pizzas that we ordered were not very good but all the starters were good. The Service is also decent. The place is not too crowded and has a good charm to it, overseeing the Yachts. Normally priced
5
During our week on Sentosa, we returned back to Miska Cafe several times!With delicious meat and salads, I highly recommend this place for lunch for any occasion
5
We had a welcome dinner here for an international group attending a business meeting. The staff were helpful and friendly, and the cuisine freshly prepared and delicious. I can especially recommend their hummus starter with bread, which was delicious, and the fish & chips which was also very nice. It is open air seating, but it has a covered roof and some excellent fans keeping things cool. Excellent location on the Marina.

It was my 6th visit at Miska, at my first visit, if i'm not mistaken that was March 2016 with my family. Me and my family was so disappointed to their service. So terrible! All the servers and even I think their manager is so rude and they're so messy so I said to myself that I will never ever go back to this huge place. But one day came, June 2016. We had no choice because the restau beside is full. So me and my family decided to had our lunch again at miska. I noticed that something change. The place is clean even they're busy. And one girl is so humble. She is so nice to every guest that came in. She's a bit fat but her smile is beautiful. I don't know if she remember me but I ask her nationality. And I knew it she is a filipina. Hospitability, its one of the most popular traits of the filipino. My family is very happy that miska had an oppurtunity to have a filipina crew like her that have a commitment to her work. On our 4th and 5th visit we saw her again and still nothing's change. Miska is leveling up because of this kind of manpower. My dad gave her a $50 tip and my dad say to her that keep it on her own. She is very much thankful that time, smiling and told to us that she will keep it for all to share with their workmates. Our heart melt, and that's one reason for us to keep comming back at miska. But last sunday, after a roundtrip at sentosa with my family we decided again to had our lunch at miska because of their very good wraps and very positive service. I noticed that they have a new chairs and it's so good to see that one of my favorite cafe is improving. But I noticed that it's very messy inside. Many glass, plates and all is just putting aside with the fact that they are so many on duty that day. So we order food, and looking for our favorite server but sad to say that she is not around. I don't know what her position but she is a good asset for the cafe. Anyway, keep up the good food miska, and train your staff to be a good and welcoming staff to their guest like you train your one girl staff. Miska will be great place to visit if all the staff is like her. All in all, food is very good and beautiful, but service is thumbs down

Service was A1 - attentive and thinking before we asked. Menu was wider than the usual eggs Benny so that was good. Lovely view of the quay. Not as crowded as the place next door but as far as I could see, this place was great. What more is there to ask for?
3
The ambiance is good, the music a bit too loud and we were a bit disappointed with the poached egg. It is even well done than a hard boiled egg. Though the plating is good, I was expecting for the oozing egg yolk. Didn't happen. But the service is good. Really attentive
3
I have been recently for the breakfast because we needed to find somewhere for our group. The food has improved dramatically for the breakfast, the but the broader menu seems a bit lost on what it is supposed to be. Its kept the wraps which are good but way overpriced.However, guys, if you read these reports, the quality of the food has improved, but fix your service. Its rubbish
5
This is a great place for lunch with a nice view in the marina. The wraps are very good; try the veal. But we also had a burger and fish and chips. All great.
5
Relaxed atmosphere, in the open air by the bay at the marina. Excellent Mediterranean food with excellent service. very good choices of light or heavier meals. We had breakfast here, service was excellent and hosts very courteous and attentive, Especially Govan; an outstanding host.
4
Had the take out - fettucine alfredo with was topped off with delicious kebab chicken, as well as a falafel. The pasta was yummy. Service was great too.

My husband and I went for lunch at 12 noon on Sunday and the restaurant was no even half full, only 3 tables occupied. We waited quite a while and yet no one gave us the menu, we needed to ask for one. There were ample staffs around to service the only 4 tables (including us) and yet no one seemed to be interested serving us. A young student came to take our order finally!!! Again, we waited for 30mins without even having our coffee served for a start. So, we asked again to have our coffee while waiting for the foods. I was furious after having to wait for more than an hour without any foods. So I asked the girl who served us earlier that I wanted to speak Wi the manager. You won't believe this!! The 1st man (I assumed is the Manager) whom the waitress approached, REFUSED to come and see us. The poor girl had to approach others and finally the so - called Bar Manager came over and told us that our order was not keyed in the system!!!!!! That was ridiculous and even so, they nvr offered to say that our order was now attended to but instead said that we needed to wait because there were few more orders before us??!!! This is beyond words. I will never step foot into the restaurant! Now I truly know why Miska was so empty when I visited, service speaks for itself isn't it

I live nearby and stopped by to order take away for lunch. I ordered the dÃƒÂ¶ner chicken wrap with the spicy sauce on the side because I wasn't sure how spicy it would be. I asked for a Coca Cola while I waited as it was pretty hot out. Before I could finish the Coke, my food order was ready and I was on my way home. The wrap came with a choice of salad or French fries. I had the fries which were shoestring type. I thoroughly enjoyed the wrap and will be back soon to sample their other offerings. The spiced chicken and Tzatziki sauce were just right. The spicy sauce was quite spicy. I found the wrap portion large; I was only able to finish about 2/3 of it. Service was fast and friendly

I was here with my family on Sunday morning. The cafe here has good selection of breakfast menu.. Food was delectable. My kids loved the eggs Benedict here and commented "it is so much better than the kiths cafe next door"The ambience here is lovely, overlooking the greenery and the marina.. So cosy and relaxing!Miska has comfy seating arrangement compared to kiths..The service is good with personnel being friendly and helpful..Keep it up, Miska!
5
After a long walk by the sea, we settled into into this colorful and charming Mediterranean cafe, sank into the sofas and proceeded to order a bucket of beers. Great way to spend the afternoon. The waiter was friendly n helpful...offered to change them ix of beers in the bucket halfway through..when we changed our mind about what we wanted...Both the chicken wraps and burger were simply awesome. Only what we wished for more was some more breeze or fan as it was extremely hot and humid. The view and ambience was grea
2
I just checked out the Miska web site and saw that they have a picture of a Greek salad on the site. First of all, it's not really a Greek salad. Second of all, my salad looked nothing like that! There was no oregano and only two or three pieces of cheese. Sadly, this is another one of those poor imitation restaurants where some local entrepreneur went to a bad Mediterranean  restaurant and set out to copy it without really taking the time to gtry to get it righ
5
After nearly 9 years in Singapore I think this was probably the best service we have had! and it really makes a difference to the overall experience. The food was delicious, and a really beautiful setting overlooking the fabulous boats in the Marina. However, the waiter was very attentive and charming, and we noticed that all the staff offered a similar level of service. A very enjoyable lunch - thank yo
5
Choosing Miska would be a very big mistake (as so many of the reviews here seem to agree). Something so simple as scrambled eggs took five re-checks from waiters and the manager, and an hour to come. And when it came, it was utterly unremarkable, watered-down eggs, no substance, scraped off the bottom of the pan. would've taken 2mins to prepare, no finesse, no love. Its not as if they were busy, half-full at best. Not once was an apology offered, just bleak what-to-do smiles at best. A quick brunch for two turned into a 90 minute ordeal. The bill, for $70! - came very quickly. Avoid like the plague. Seriously. They simply don't get it..
5
Kids had the meatballs nice ambiance and attentive service A great Caesar salad i had the chicken doner kebab;;; a big big thumbs up !!
5
It was a nice experience i always visit Santosa miska it's the best food there I enjoy the view I will come again soon , recommend it
3
The group of restaurants have a fairly captive audience and they charge top prices for mediocre food.
5
Had a great time, eaten there many times, food was great , service was prompt and courteous , prices very reasonable, many meals large enough to share between two of us. Marina setting was very charming.
4
Nearby w hotel. Indoor and outdoor seats available. Price is reasonable portion is good as well. Quiet during weekdays which makes your trip a relaxing one.
2
I was promptly seated and was excited about trying some of their food, but was quickly forgotten about and after 25-minutes of trying to flag down a waiter and place my order, I got up and walked away.
3
ate here twice and both times they could not provide different items on the menu. Food was nice but a little disappointed first choices not available both times
4
Came down with a group of friends to have a casual meal, didn't think Miska was that good by the look at it but goodness me... The service and food was beyond expectation , the hummus was something unique that I've never tasted before and the chicken kebabs was simply delicious , price ($20+) was a little costly for just a wrap and fries but it was worth it as the taste was incredible! Service was fast and the service crew was incredibly courteous and knowledgable on the food items to recommend their specialties without even us asking (which I think is a plus point in service on having the initiative). Was being cared and taken care very well of by a handsome avionics chap whos working part-time , definitely coming back for the service and the $35 per bottle of wines!!! Overall, really good service , drinks was fast , food was fast and delicious too and the Ambiance was simply AMAZING ! Would come again
1
Horrendous experience...be it food (pathetic) or service (indifferent). Decided to eat here with friends (4 adults, 2 kids) after walking through the entire lane of restaurants at the Cove and realized quickly what a bad choice we made. Hummus had no taste (no salt), dishes we ordered were stale-tasting and devoid of taste.We ordered the kids food first as they were hungry, and they conveniently forgot about it, and upon reminding their Margherita was the last to arrive!We were so put off by the whole experience that we requested to see the manager. he was willing to listen but I guess had little to defend when the facts were so heavily stacked against him.Will NEVER visit again.
5
I have been to this excellent place several times already and I have been here for dinner every time since my last three visits to Singapore. Just a great place to hangout and dinner along with a good meal I just love the ambiance and food
