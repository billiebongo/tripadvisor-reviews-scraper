We were amazed to find vegetarian soup options and further surprised that the mushroom soup we ordered was not only plentiful but delicious.

Love this place, simple and effective soups selections with a variety of set combos.
After a quick soup and salad during you lunch break look no further.

A nice find and ended up visiting a few times on recent Singapore visits. Plenty of options for breakfast, lunch, dinner or just a snack & coffee. Tasty soups & very good sandwiches & the coffee is pretty good. Very reasonable prices! Always found the staff friendly as well. Will be there again on my next visit

I only ate here once but wish I had discovered it earlier in my trip. The soup and sandwiches were very tasty and made a pleasant change from the other fast food offerings in the Mall. Very popular with Locals which is always a good sign

I realize that one has to temper expectations in restaurants which service corporate business parks, but I cant find any redeeming qualities for this restaurant. It tries to do too much, and doesnt really do much well. In fairness I have tried a soup and a sandwich, which were both very disappointing.The soup had no taste, it was their signature laksa, but was very bland noodles with a few miniscule toppings. I had their Tokyo sandwich too, which was another disappointment. They put 2 slices of cucumber, literally 3 strangs of onions, some pre-cooked chicken and drowned it in sauce. So, all I really tasted was the bread and sauce, as everything else was drowned out.With so many options in Changi Biz Park, even in this building, I cant imagine they will have lots of repeat customers, unless they do something about the quality. I really hope the management objectively samples their own food ... they only have 1 chance at first impressions, and so far, not so great.I might try their pasta, will wait a month though in hopes they work out their kinks
