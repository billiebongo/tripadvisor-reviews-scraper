Really enjoyed the fresh food and presentation. Healthy and nice. Vegetarian food with less oil more flavours. Must visit for vegetarians. Set meals $28 sgd incl drinks starters and dessert. Good salad and soup is part of the sets. Loved the herbal soup they use lingzhi in their soup. Good choices if sharing nice for functions. Quiet location internally....hidden ge

Situated near City Square Mall and Farrer Park MRT station (no longer at North Bridge Road), this little cafe serves excellent vegetarian food service à la russe. Opted for the dinner set, came with 2 appetizers, salad, soup, fruit enzyme vinegar drink as palate cleanser, main course and a dessert. No mock meat in the dishes. Wholesome vegetables. Most vegetarian stalls in Singapore serves lots of mock meat and is not creative with using vegetables only. Staff is friendly and explained each dish on how it is cooked when serving

Brought my family members there and they enjoyed the vegetarian set lunch dishes very much despite not being vegetarians. We each ordered different dishes - Rendang rice, hokkien noodles, hainanese chicken rice, vegetarian pork knuckle with vinegar, pizza, kimchi brown rice with seaweed wrap and we all agreed that they were all of good standard. Especially the vegetarian pork knuckle in vinegar, it was absolutely a great stew as the black vinegar seeped through the entire ginger too and was tasty to drink it on its own and delicious with rice. It was a six course set lunch and the plum vinegar served before main dish was refreshing to prep us for the mains. It was obvious that careful thoughts were put into preparing the dishes and the food presentation. The ambience of the restaurant was very conducive for even business meetings and the service by the staff were professional as they would explain the dishes when they were served. Honzen also caters vegetarian confinement meals and would work with ladies on the dishes preferred than to have a fixed menu for others to go with it. This place is highly recommended for vegetarians and for those who are unfamiliar with vegetarian. Non-vegetarians would be surprised with such great standard of food to help all to be healthy.

Situated in Little India at Sam Leong Street is Honzen. This vegetarian restaurant was at Bugis area but have moved to Little India. I have been to this restaurant when they were operating at Bugis and when I wanted to visit them again last year, they were no longer there.Due to my busy schedule, I didn’t really catch up on what’s new in the vegetarian food scene in Singapore. It seems that there are lots of happenings.If it wasn’t someone who told me about this eatery last December, I would have thought this restaurant no longer exist. Being invited to a dinner at this place by someone, I brought with me the old expectation which I have when I last visited them. Surprise! When I stepped into this place, the renovation catch my attention - it projected a calm and peaceful vibe. The next surprise was to discover that they moved into a new dinning concept – Vegetarian Fine Dining and on the 2nd level is their tea house. Indeed, this is contributing to a more vibrant vegetarian food scene here. Kudos.Vegetarians now here have more choices. I believe it would provide another food venue for non-vegetarian to sample different type of vegetarian food. Here, diner get to choose from few set menu and it will be changed often for the surprise element. The food is delicious and kid menu (Burger with salad and fried, Mushroom Soup) at $10 is available.As it is of fine-dining concept, so for big eaters, you may need to order some side orders. However, a pleasant place to charm your beloved this Valentine’s day

Honzen Café is a fully vegetarian joint with a green ambience as they believe in spreading healthy eating options among the public. The ambience is very calm and good to relax even during crowded times. They have some good meal sets and some refreshing drinks. The ‘TomYum Fried Rice’ and ‘Olives Fried Rice’ are good options. If you want to experiment, then the ‘Dragonfruit Fried Rice’ has an interesting touch to it. The soups and ‘homemade healthy drinks’ (ensure to state less ice required) are good

A friend has been recommending this place for some time, and we visited this on a Saturday evening.2 families, with young children. Parking was a slight issue, being a weekend evening.When making a reservation (not really required on most days) we were told last orders were at 9pm. We arrived just in time, and ordered a wide variety from their menu, but nothing too exciting.Food quality was uniformly good. Half of our party are not vegetarian, and they liked their food as well. Portion size was average. Service was very good. Price is average for a sit-down restaurant, about S$7 for a fried rice.Very repeatable. Bonus points for not making a big deal of how vegetarian is healthy. Just good food
