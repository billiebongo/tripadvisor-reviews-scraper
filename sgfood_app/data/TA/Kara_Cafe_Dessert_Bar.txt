Food was alright, loved the way they plate the food and drinks. But service was slow due to lack of staffs and an overcrowded place, staffs were very polite and friendly as well.
4
Was there on a weekday afternoon and glad to have a quiet place to chill and enjoy conversations. Ordered the rice bowl and it was tasty! Menu was extensive and would love to try the other dishes next time,
5
We wanted to try something new along Bukit Timah and came across Kara. We weren't disappointed. The food portions were very generous and the ambience in the cafe was pretty nice. Staff were friendly and helpful.
3
Food is fantastic. The pork belly melts in your mouth. My daughter ordered the dark chocolate brownie, the taste is just nice and not sweet.
3
The food quality was reasonably good however, pricing-wise, it does not really offer value-for-money.
4
Delicious food and desserts by the people of sogurt. Love the okonomiyaki truffle tots. Healthy food options available too.
5
Went on a rainy Friday evening so the crowd was still okay. The chef came out personally to let us know the reason for serving the food late. Staff were friendly as well.
3
Food was average but the decoration of the cafe was nice. Their best item will be their mochi waffles,

Feel good factor 1: pastel, cheerful decor - pink, wooden, tropical leaves, cute stools and the yogurt dispenser. A happy place and the exterior looks really inviting and cozy too!Feel good factor 2: healthy options of salad and açai bowls available. My companion and I were hungry so we had the miso pork belly bowl and it was scrumptious! Loved the fact that sriracha sauce was readily available to jazz it up, but I could have done without as the food was flavourful enough.Feel good factor 3: beans from Papa Palphetta rarely go wrong. Earlier reviews of the coffee here were lacklustre, so perhaps this has been fixed. Could have been better: service in multiple aspects e.g. promptness in assigning seats (unless it’s free seating?) and clearing table (each drink came on a nice wooden tray, but it wasn’t great when the table for two was small and my partner had finished his drink). The serving is small for the price point, though it’s still worth it if you use the Entertainer app

Went specially for the exclusive christmas dinner set menu that's only available till 31st December'17. Was initially doubtful of it, given that there isn't any reviews online and hence I did not harbour much hope on the quality of food. However, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise! The 3 course meal was indeed satisfying, especially the mushroom soup (appetiser) and chicken cordon bleu (mains). One of the best cordon bleu I've ever had, which also came with japanese curry sauce! The matcha mochi waffle that's served for the dessert was also delightful, especially with a chewy mochi interior and a distinctive earthy note. The only complain was its small portion.
5
We have been here many times before, food quality is consistent and ambience the same. Would return again.
4
My second time in this place and it still doesn't disappoint. Food is decent, healthy and also with reasonable price. Love the super relaxed ambience. Plus it also has Entertainer discount!
5
We went there for tea/dessert. The waffles and the froyo are good and with good presentation. The avocado smoothie is tasty but a bit sweet. The service is great! The owner and staff are helpful and nice.
4
Am always very heartened by the quality of the service here - though the staff are young, they're consistently eager and unpretentious.
5
Nice dessert and great sevice in a cosy cafe. Great for enjoying some ME time or spending time with your loved ones or friends.
4
Nice place with a cosy ambience to chill with friends. Decor was cute and pretty too. Food was served quite efficiently! Like the vibe of the cafe
2
Except for the service which was really subpar. Staff couldnt even muster a smile. Food was mediocre. Wont be back
4
beautiful place to have brunch w your friends ~ the food arrives quickly but may be a little pricey!
4
Ordered the sesame soba noodle from the healthy menu and fish tempura with garlic Japanese rice, both are nice! The blush pink dim ambience makes the whole experience even better! As for dessert, the matcha waffle is surprisingly good! It comes with dark chocolate froyo which complements the matcha flavour. One thing didn’t expect was they no longer offer choice of toppings and froyo flavour - as what I read from Burpple’s review. Overall I’ll return again. Do remember to utilise the Entertainer App
5
The cafe was very prettily decorated and the variety of food options was great! Really loved the truffle cheese sandwich and other dishes like the healthy grain bowls and cheesy meatballs were good too! Was too full for dessert but they sounded amazing and would definitely want to go back to try them
5
The cafe was really sweet and beautiful. It was spacious and a clean environment. Food was mediocre.
4
the servers provide good service and food is served promptly. the food is well prepared and provide a healthy & sumptuous meal. the restaurant itself is quiet with ample seats. No trouble finding parking space too.
4
Got a salad and boy was it yummy!
Coffee there was average - wouldn't rave about it, but I'd definitely be back because it was a chill place to hang with friends.
4
Had a very nice time at this well decorated cafe in bukit timah, the service was great and good was lovely (we had pork belly bowls). A little bit pricey but good food.
5
Such a pretty place with lively energy. The food was good too but I have yet to try their yoghurt. Saw many people eating it, we shall try it next time.
3
The food here was average, there was a strange aftertaste to the food and I found a strand of hair in my meal. The fro-yo seemed nice but I lost my appetite after my main course. Left early.
4
Food was really good though would be even better if the rice bowl can be warmed up esp for kids. But not microwaved, mind you. Then it's no different from any cheap food outside.
4
Flavours of grain bowls are interesting! We enjoyed the curry pomelo bowl. Portions are generous too.
5
Not my first visit. I like the decoration of the cafe. Food is good and they always introduce new food to the menu.
5
The employees at KARA were nice enough to hold my table for me even though I arrived late and it was during the peak hour, really appreciated the gesture. Customer service was excellent, they attended to my needs and were extremely polite/friendly. Food was pretty average for the pork belly miso, but I loved the grilled toasties and waffles. Will highly recommend for those looking for a nice weekend brunch
4
Slightly pricer items but taste pretty good. Wait staff should be more attentive. Overall a nice place
4
The food was okay-ish, great range of healthy options. But my fav part of the place was the deco and nice vibes of the place!
4
Nice quite place to chill. Only tried the rice bowl and toasties but portion pretty small. The staff were pretty friendly and when lent an umbrella cos it was raining Super heavy!
5
Good food..nice place..great frozen yoghurt...the staff are great also. I will be back there for sure..
5
Was looking for a quite cafe for coffee and scrolled through chope. Chanced on this place and i really liked it! My kind of ambience and deco and the food was good too! Will come back again and try other stuff on the menu :)
3
Waffles were awesome! Coffee was bad, too milky. As for the grilled toasts, maybe I've made the wrong choice. But anyway, I'll still go back for the awesome waffles! Love the chewy texture
4
healthy food options available with solid desert.
really elegant and pretty interiors.
good for small to medium groups
5
A quiet cafe serving healthy food. Its simple menu belies the delicious flavours that come with their rice bowls, which by the way, are a creative concoction of wholesome foods. I never knew healthy food can be yummy, until I went to Kara. Highly recommended, especially for small group gatherings
4
This is my second visit and the sandwiches still blow me away. I had the French onion grilled cheese sandwich, which was served with beef pastrami. The mochi waffles are great too but quite overpriced at $12.50 with original froyo (additional cost for choosing your own flavours).
3
Portion are little for the price paid. Japanese fried garlic rice seems just like white rice. Overall, paid $14-$16++ for a bowl of rice with little mixture of veg. Other similar salad cafe alternatives will provide a larger portion of veg at a much cheaper price.
