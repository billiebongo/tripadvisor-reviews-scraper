It’s in the busy food court area but lots of options for food and looks very clean too. The Mee Goreng and Beef Randang were average. Reasonable prices for ready prepared fast food.
4
... we stumbled across this food place. With some brief searching we found some nice veg choices at good prices too! YMMV
4
During a hard day of shopping we went to the Food Court. Check out the view down from the top floor of the computer monitor floor. Great little Food Court, good food and not too pricy for this high end mall.
3
Probably the most expensive food court in Singapore!
Quality is ok.
What makes it convenient is that it's inside the Marina Bay Sands and it's the only food court around and far cheaper than the other restaurants in the mall and casino.
2
I rate this low because of the overpriced foods available at each stalls and the amount of servings is just normal. Of course it is located inside Marina Bay Sands Shoppes Mall but the price should also be worth it. One big problem of this place is that the tables are not cleared fast, which means people takes a long time to wait for it to be cleared, which results to time wasted before ordering the food, which then results to more and more people waiting to eat. It is too inefficient. This has to improve
4
After walking from Esplanade up to Marina Bay Sand, we stopped at this foodcourt to buy something to drink and to eat.Well, the variety of menu are okay, but the price are a little bit expensive.But this was the cheapest compare to eating in a fine dining resto in this complex.So just enjoy!
3
Food options are various but slightly overpriced than other malls’ food court. Food was just okay not that great. This place is busy and so crowded at lunch time, it’s really hard to find a seat. Not recommended if you want to taste authentic SG food.
4
Very good, accessible place to eat if visiting the Marina Bay Sands. You also get the chance to experience food in one of the famous hawker centers in Singapore. Prices are ok for where this place is located. Many options to choose from, ranging from Japanese cuisine to Thai, Chinese (more or less traditional, depending on what you prefer) and also Singaporean local cuisine
5
Great little food court in the Marina Bay Sands quick and easy, the hard thing was to decide what kind of dish you would like to try, there is so many great choices, good, busy atmosphere, seating is tricky at launch time, We recommend Indian Express, great Naan and Dahl. We would go back again when in Singapore
4
I'm from BKK Thailand. If u can't find other yummy chicken rice store on local street, I recommend eating Chicken Rice here. It is more delicious than other Department Store on Orchard Road. Maybe because of those PARLEY (Thai Pak Chee) that other store didn't put it in. Yummy as same as in Thailand. Price not too high just 7-9 SGD per set including Canton boiled veggie (choy)
4
Even its not a big place, but these food court more than enough to satisfied your taste. So many choice of food & drink from several asian country in here. Good atmosphere. But its not easy to get seat during lunch time.
5
This food court below marina bay sands has good options including an indian section and veg. We also tried friedn noodles in one of the right corner sction.
Overall good value for money and quite filling.
5
We eat here every time we stay in Singapore. $7.30 for fresh noodles, made in front of you, wantan soup. One of our favourites. One bowl fills you up. A fantastic lunch while checking out the area.
2
There are much better option elsewhere in Singapore. don't let convenience lure you into a mediocre and expensive experience. Just step outside the hotel and you have a world of better options.
5
We found the food cheap and varied amongst all the cafes and restaurants. Western and local options are available and there is a escalator to marina bay sands hotel to save crossing the road
Proper restaurants are located on the first floor
4
The food court is located in the shopping area of the Bay Sands Mall.. there is a place called Indian Express in the food court where you get basic Indian food.. the taste is basi but in a place where getting veg food is rare this is a boo
1
OK, so this place is close to the hotel and is air-conditioned, but STOP. you really don't want to waste a meal at this location. It's crowded, the prices are nothing short of a rip-off and you get food that's a poor shadow of what real street food is like in Singapore. Just venture out a little. even Newton is a decent experience compared to this tourist trap. Walk a little, take the MRT, take a cab. you can find a wealth of real legit Singapore street food that will be much more memorable than a sterile employee cafeteria that's Ras
4
I know some people would turn their noses up at eating in a mall food court, but we really don't care if the food if good enough. We have tried several stalls at this food court during out Singapore visits, and most were pretty good. Yes the prices are a little higher than the outdoor hawker markets, but we found the food to be just as good, so a great option to avoid the heat and enjoy the food. Special mention to the the char kway teow at Thye Hong, which was among the best we had anywhere in Singapore
1
Not the type to leave reviews but felt compelled after forcing down a few mouthfuls of curry at Indian Express. They charge abt 13 dlrs for watered-down tasteless sludge that would be easily bested any where on the street - and I mean anywhere. It's that bad. Avoid at all cost!
1
If you're a tourist, don't bother with this place. If you're a local, you should be ashamed coming here. Don't get me wrong, the food here is passable. Not great, but it will fill you. you can stand in line for poor service, fork over a fortune, and get mediocre food all in one place
4
It's small and more upscale compared to other hawker centers in Singapore but it's got several choices of very good food. The chicken and rice is the signature dish of the city and here was very good.
4
A lot of food options like Korean food, japanese, indian, chinese cuisines. It's a bit pricey compare outside Marina Bay Sands, but what I can say is the food here is much better though.
3
To expensive as everythi g is in Marina Bay Sands. But okplace to get some food before continuing your walk around Singapore.
4
Aas afraid to only have bad expensive choices in Bay Sands, but actually the food and prices were better than expected. Obviously not as good as a real hawker center but very good for what it is.
1
My mother's meal from Nasi Padang cost $24. I have never had such an expensive meal in a food court. My mother is a tourist, and a little unsure, pointed at some dishes as she has in other foodcourts. The person serving piled on the food and then charged a-la-carte prices. $24 is a ridiculous price in a food court. They took advantage of her, as she did not know and hence paid. After I complained and threatened to take a photo, only then did they offer, very reluctantly, a partial refund. But my mother was very upset, as it felt as if she was ripped off because she is a tourist. I know that this is not common and not the norm in Singapore, and was very disappointed she had such a negative experience in a city I love. I suggest everyone avoid this store, and avoid this foodcourt. Oh, and the $24 meal, the taste was not even good
4
Attached to Marina Bay Sands Hotel and a Casino for locals and tourists separated.Variety of eateries for everyone's tastebuds.A small ice rink and boat rides boasts some fun.Designer shops for the Rich and famous to be intrigued.Outside one can access the science museum
2
We admittedly only had two oyster omelettes, but they were neither refined, nor special, nor cheap. The oysters didn’t taste fresh and both they and the egg were overcooked and therefore rubbery.Service was unhelpful and unfriendly. No-one notified us that the omelettes were ready despite the fact we were sitting at a table nearby. The surroundings though are pleasant and it’s blissfully air-conditioned. This place obviously capitalises on its new iconic location. Save your money and opt for another food court, or at least don’t go for the omelettes

Rasapura Masters is the food court for The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands — a high-end luxury mall. Rasapura delivers tastes that span Asian flavors (Indian, Thai, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Singaporean, etc.). Some reviewers complained of lukewarm food that had apparently sat out for hours. This wasn't my experience. Walk through and see what looks good to you. Fresh made noodles, prepared before your eyes, dim sum, chili crab, pad thai, tian tian chicken, fresh naan, etc. Drinks can be purchased at a kiosk.
1
Visited a few times this foodcourt. Food is in hot containers for hours: tasteless and overcooked. Staff does not give you the time to choose. If you asked what a certain meal is they put it already on your plate. Chaotic, overcrowded and noisy place. Not the venue to enjoy your meal (if you can find a seat anyway
4
Came her twice of coffee, neither very good, and once for lunch, very good. The food centre is on the lowest level of the building and adjoins a large ice skating area, so some entertainment can be had free. There are multiple food outlets serving all manner of Asian goodies. We ate dumplings, sates, and noodles and all were quite good. Be prepared for a long search for a table, and often best to ask to share one already occupied. Prices are reasonable, although, as befits the location, a little more than other food centres in shopping malls we visited
4
Had the Spicy Beef Ball Noodles. Boy was it ever Spicy enjoyed every bite till it was all gone. Great place to eat about the cheapest around here enjoying all the Christmas deco as well.
4
Pretty good Food for mall food. Better than usual food hall food at an ok price! Was fresh and contained lots of squid and prawns and the rice was well flavoured and the noodles of a good quality.
5
Fantastic Flavours , Fresh medium size prawns, lovely after taste of the sambal is a momentz to catch!
3
Nothing special but really fast and no expensive. If you don't have much time is a good choice because is really easy to find because is in front of Starbucks's coffee. But the food is not really hot, I think is prepare before.
4
this is the high-end foodcourt that's located in the Marina Bay Sands shopping area. It has a superbly wide selection of stalls, a lot of it serving decent food (but not fantastic). It's not cheap, but likely to be the most budget conscious on offer. Getting a seat can be challenging during peak hours
5
This place is on the basement far right end corner of the Shoppe Marina Bay if you look facing the Shoppe. It looks amazing and pumping with queue of people every shops. We did not have time to eat there but managed to takeouts from the dim sim place and it was yummy! I reckon this is not cheap but the space is nice, clean, convenient and air con. so we all paid for that
4
This is not your standard food court - it is in the basement of the Marina Bay Sands complex - it is near the Science Museum and Helix bridge end of the basement near the roller skating rink.The food court is slightly upmarket with reasonable prices at most outlets.There are over fifteen stalls in the food court - tastes from all over Asia will definitely tempt the taste buds.My local friend invited me for dinner tonight - we ordered from the Pepper Lunch Express stall - the food is self cooked on a hot stone plate - we both enjoyed our pepper steak dishes mind you her cooking was better than mine...LOLHaving recently eaten at outlets in Hangzhou (China) and Perth (Western Australia) I can recommend this chain...meals are consistent and well worth visiting if you ever see a Pepper Lunch Express outlet
3
To be honest the price of the food in this food court is a little bit pricey compare with Lau Pa Sat food court or Maxwell Hawker Centre in Chinatown. The food taste is also not as delicious as the other hawker place in Singapore. I ate here because I stayed in Marina Bay Sands so I might as well as try the food in this food court. I have beef fried kwee tiaw but it doesn't taste as good as in the other place.
2
Ate here twice while staying at the Marina Bay Sands for our honeymoon. First time we ate I had a few samplings of Chinese and Indian food and green bean buns while my husband ordered the Three Types of Meat with rice. My food was not spectacular. The vegetable curry was not very tasty and the vegetable selection was quite poor. There was a lot of cabbage in there and I don't remember much else. I also had a tofu and green bean dish with my food and it wasn't great either. Paid about 10sgd for that and it just wasn't worth it. The green bean buns that I bought near the beverage stall were pretty good though. My husband's food, according to him, was really tasty and it was quite a big serving. Second time I had the oyster omelet and mantou buns. I've definitely had much better for both. The oyster omelet was scant of oysters. Only half the omelet had them! The mantou buns were good, 5 pieces for 5sgd but how can you go wrong with those buns. Also ordered salted egg buns and while it was okay, it lacked the creaminess of others. But it was okay for the price. Husband striked out on his second meal of dry ramen with chicken cutlets. So there are some good items but there are also lots of misses. Overall, I think for the price though you'd be better off eating somewhere else.

Had a light meal a couple of times at Rasapura Masters in Marina Bay Sands shopping centre. It's like a food court, mostly asian and none of the fast food favourites. As long as you like asian, meals are tasty, quick and reasonably priced. Just what you need after a few hours window shopping at Marina Bay Sands. Plenty of choices and although busy, plenty of tables
1
The Good:
-nice cold air-con.
-plenty of nearby attractions.
-clean dining area.
-for hotel guests, this is the lowest priced F&B option in the resort.
The Bad:
-300% overpriced compared to what u can get at the local market.
4
we had lunch down here after window shopping,very busy and lots of choices.not that expensive and the food was good.
ken
4
We came here for lunch. It was good food, not too expensive (though about double the price you'd find at local hawker centers) and fast. Worth it.
5
You can find cheap treat in this food court. With very classy interiors and decent option for the hungry and the still-full tourist.
You can find ice kacang here but not the same as the one in Gluttons by the Bay.
4
I always like to check out food courts in foreign countries. In my opinion, this is much higher quality than your typical food court fare. I actually ate there twice, as the selections were good, the prices reasonable, and the location at the bottom level of marina bay sands mall, convenient. I had chicken and rice that was really really good..my wife had fish soup that she thought was too "fishy" but once she added some spices it was better. I thought the iced coffee and iced milk tea at one of the stalls was amazing and helped overcome the jet lag blues. We didn't test it out but a few of the stands are supposed to be open 24 hours which would be nice when your mental clock wakes you up at 3am

Marina Bay Sands is not an easy place for the elderly couple. One has to walk a lot to see and enjoy everything. Our legs were tired and we wanted to have the food. It seemed thousands of people were having their lunch when we entered Rasapura. Fortunately we got seat immediately. The quality of food was good. The price was not very high. It was a good feeling to look around us and enjoying the food. All kinds of food were available, Indian, Chinese, Thai, Nyonya, Singaporean, European etc. There were Halal food shops and health food shops too
4
We decided to spend half a day at the Marina Bay Mall and was actually looking for a place to eat for lunch. Since we were battling with the lunch crowd and it was a public holiday, we sort of grab whatever seat we can find and plonk ourselves down. The next thing was to look for food! There was 4 of us. 2 of us decided to go for the Soy Braised Duck Combo with rice and the other 2 went for the BBQ Chicken combo with rice. The soy braised duck port combo was very delicious and the meat soft and tender. The BBQ chicken was very good as well. We actually opted for 3 BBQ Chicken and a portion of the braised duck. This came up to a total of SGD22.30 for the 3 of us. For drinks we ordered hot coffee and Coffee ice. That came up to SGD$5.40. So, all in all for the 4 of us, we spent in total just about close to SGD$30.00. A good meal, I must say
3
Large and various selection of food, ALWAYS busy here. I've tried the Indian food twice (last time it left me sick for days), juice place and the stand serving drinks. I must admit that food courts aren't my fav because they are so crowded and busy, but they surely give you the opportunity to try so many dishes you probably wonder about without spending a fortune. This food court is cleaner and better organized than the famous Lao Pa Sat, but not as good as food court of Takashimaya or Tangs on Orchar
4
Just loved the food! We ate here twice during our 10 day stay in Singapore and would have probably eaten here more if we were in the area. It was nice to see the chefs making the noodles and dumplings right in front of you before cooking, you canâ€™t get any fresher than that. I had a spicy soup with noodles and seafood and he had noodles and dumplings. Both dishes had completely different flavours yet were equally as delicious. I wish I could recreate these dishes at home. If we ever get back to Singapore, guess where my first stop will be
5
If you are hungry / thirsty , do stop at Rasapura Masters at the food court of Marina Bay sands and you can have what ever you want.1. My kids wanted Noodles in a certain way with only some selected veggies, they cook as per your needs and dish out a great meal.2. The local coffee that they make is wonderful, very tasty. Try it 
4
The food court in the Marina Sands Bay area offers various restaurants with different cuisines. This one was a good one, beef noodles, various styles. Valuable and reasonable for the money you pay.
3
We have come here twice. It is not too expensive for the food but quite pricey for the drinks. And there is Ng Ah Sio Bak Kur Te outlet there.
4
We stopped here for a quick bit and the food was good, the time it took was also reasonable. so if you are around pop in there's a large selection to choose from just get a table first.
5
This is not only a beautiful property but very iconic building.The rooms are spacious with plenty of amenities. The restaurants I visited were superb. The infinity pool on the roof is a huge draw but you must be a registered guest for access. This is a must-see property on your visit to Singapore
4
Always looking for this hookian mie when i go to singapore.. great taste.. i can droll even just look at this photo.. hahaha.. those 4 big prawns looks so yummy.. :)But, this place is just too crowded on weekends.. i have to wait till 15minutes just to get table by my own.. :

The Rasapura Masters Food Hall next to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino is an exception local food hall. It has a wide variety of Singaporean and other other As1an foods at fair prices with good seating and conditions. All food stall run under the same brand which makes it easy to stroll around and chose your food in your own time. I chose a South Indian Thali. The food was tasty and delicious and the Naan freshly made from scratch in less that 5 minutes when the food was ordered. My wife order a modern tasty Chicken dish with rice and vegetables that was both very tasty and well presented. If you are hanging around the casino and what a nice local place to eat I can recommend Rasapura Masters Food Court
2
Why are there 2 listings for Rasapura on Tripadvisor? Anyway, as I've written in my other review: There is nothing good to eat in MBS! Or nothing reasonably priced and good... Walked the whole length of MBS and didn't find anything of my fancy. The cafe I wanted to go (went before and it was quite nice) but couldn't find it. The same location is now a bank... Suppose it closed down... So I ended up in the food court. Walked around it and noticed everything is about 2-3 times more expensive than normal food courts. EXPENSIVE!Laksa for $8?!! That's madness... Korean food for $12?! That's restaurant price! Not food court. After one round I decided to get the KL Ancient Charcoal noodles. The most "special" dish on the list other than normal chicken rice, fish ball noodles etc. I think the noodles were ready made and just heated. I saw him pouring a ready cooked bowl of noodles into the wok and just adding a dash of dark soy sauce, stir up and serve... Not so authentic!The taste of the noodles was black, bitter and not great. The noodles were more like thick udon noodles than hokkien mee. I've had this in KL before, the one in Rasapura is nothing like it. Even though it's Rasapura "Masters" food court... I wouldn't eat in this food court ever again and I would definitely not recommend it. Bad. Never again..
3
Place is always crowded and food is so-so for the price one has to pay. There is no return tray policy so customers just leave their plates, cups and bottles which the cleaning staff only clears certain trays and plates. I am not sure if they are allocated to only clear for certain food stalls as they did not clear the other items like plastic bottled water and cups
3
Visited here whilst staying at the hotel,this in the food court area of the shopping mall and has a large selection of food outlets all serving various Asian dishes and snacks and is frequented by the locals.Quality is not great but it's a good cost alternative to the restaurants in the area
3
This is located in the far end of the shopping center in front of the hotel by the ice skating rink. There is a good selection of dishes, but the taste is often a far cry from the dish you were hoping for. Very average with an average price tag. Skip it and go to Lau po sat which is a 15 min walk and also has a big food court with satay vendors out back.
4
Food is good, we were only able to try the bah kut teh and duck rice and nothing else. But overall the bah kut teh was tasty although it's not fall off the bone. Duck rice was tasty and delicious.
3
Simple and traditional dishes at affordable prices and very quickly served. Also open late at night which is a plus point for us since we like going out at nights!
3
Being a weekend, it was packed and nearly impossible to find a place to sit. Food choices is in abandone. Each one looks delicious. That is why I keep coming back.
3
This foodcourt serves a fair array of hawker food, at about double the price compared to places outside of town. The food is nothing to shout about, but it is nonetheless one of the most economical places to eat at MBS
4
The Rasapura Masters in the basement of the Marina Bay Sands has a variety of cuisines to choose from. We tried Indian food and traditional Singapore rice food. Both were freshly prepared and worth value for money.
2
As I would like to try local dishes I went to see Rasapura but the place was too crowded. All the shops has a long cue. I was advised that late afternoon is the best time to go there.
5
I came here as it was nearest to the attractions that I was visiting. There is a huge amount of choice here, ranging from local, to Korean, to Japanese, to European. I came here for brunch and afternoon tea as I wanted to try at least two different types of cuisines. I was fortunate to come during a weekday when it was not too crowded, but I understand that it can get very busy here at times during the weekends
4
They serve various food. Just be aware it will be so crowded during lunch or dinner. The taste of the food is acceptable. If you come with family or group of friends, this is a good place that everyone can get what they want. From the big portion until the small one
3
if you like to taste different asian styles of food and this in a quiet crowded ambiance, then you're at the right place. i like to have a big range of different choices of food and so it was okay. food was fresh made, but is not really the place for a romantic dinner.
1
Really terrible service. Beware of a stall named western coffee which sells coffee and cakes because they will try to cheat on changes. Give the cashier 50 dollar bill but she kept pretending she received 15 only. Asked for CCTV footage from another young man and later claimed it is not clear. Also not giving receipt at first, then later only gave another reprinted receipt without typing actual cash received from me so no evidence at all! This is much worse than a hawker centre anywhere else in Singapore
