Yesterday came to Ang Mo Kio Food Market after looking at local forum that this stall has been advertised on television and online.Tasty Hainanese chicken rice with their special green sauce (garlic flavour)Order their chicken set that come with vegetables. Came with a huge portion and feel very full after the meal.I will attached the photos of the tasty chicken set here.A worthwhile place to recommend if you are at Ang Mo Kio Central and source for the best food
