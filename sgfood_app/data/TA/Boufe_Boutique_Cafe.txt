Have been to this cafe 3 times and it never disappoints. Honey wings still taste great! Tried the duck confit too which is soft and tender!
5
Great place albeit the rural location, friendly staff and good food. All you can ask for on a good day out.
5
The cakes are yummy and not so sweet. Food wise portion is good and taste good too. Salmon is fresh and the truffle fries is crispy.
5
Food and ambience is nice and affordable however its not very accessible if you do not own a car. A nice place to hang out
4
French toast and duck confit with mash potatoes were tasty. Some water glasses were leaking which the staff helped to change after we informed them. Nice ambience too.
4
my friend and I utterly enjoyed our lunch there. The wings was fantastic and the pull pork egg ben was great!
5
Ordered the big breakfast set and prawn aglio to share. Food is tasty and cake was delicious. Would come back again for the milky way cake.
4
My first online reservation with CHOPE and booked Boufe for a lunch meeting. Both my guest and I enjoyed the food served as they were good and so was the service.
4
Boufe serves one of the best croissants that I’ve tried. Though small, it’s soft and fluffy. Triple B has always been my go-to when I visit as it provides a good variety for a hearty meal.Now, boufe also serves main and pasta during lunch. Awesome! In addition, they also serve pretty desserts
5
I ordered a mushroom pasta and it was one of the tastiest I've ever had! It has a generous portion of mushrooms and cheese. Not to mention the aromas of truffles made the dish simply irresistible!The children enjoyed playing on the swing located at the restaurant's entrance too
3
Booked a table on Chope 3 days before the day itself. Went there and found out that my table is not reserve and I have to wait for 15 mins..
4
It is a great place to catch up with friends, but it is a little out of the way. The food is great, desserts look pretty for Instagram though not so great tasting.
5
Food looks good and taste great too.. Will be back again.. Service was great too. Love the truffle fries, chicken wings, pasta & french toast especially.
5
Their drink menu is interesting due to their creative. It is truly magic to make it fun. For food, it is also not bad. I love their dessert. Too pretty to eat this.
4
Beautiful atmosphere, serenity for a breather, great food, dessert not overrated at all despite the social media hype. Just a little on the pricier side.
4
Nice ambience, tasty food. But disappointed with the drinks, tasteless. However, everything was instagram-worthy. Still worth a visit.
5
Visited boufe cafe on my birthday. The staff there are very friendly and thoughtful.. food there are excellent and they even have complimentary cake on my birthday. Its a very pleasant trip to the cafe and definite worth returning!
4
Beautiful n photo worthy desserts for selection. Great ambience to dine in. But location can be a little inaccessible.

Boufe Boutique Cafe, located in Phoenix PkÂ is set away from the bustling streets and noise, allowing one to have a quiet time in this beautiful minimalist cafe. Direction:Alight at Redhill MRT station, Exit A. Walk to bus stop opposite Redhill MRT station. (Stop ID 10201). Alight 2 stops later. Back track down Tanglin Road to Phoenix Park. Walk pass the guard room and continue straight to the end of the road. Turn right at the end of the road. Walk to destination. Journey time about 15 minutesWe ordered Boufe's Triple B ($21), Caesar Salad ($11), hashbrowns, 2 pots of tea ($10) & mini unicorn cake ($9). Imo, food is average and tad overpriced. Their popular desserts are the milky way & mini unicorn. I chose the mini unicorn. Simple! Kind of too sweet for me, but overall is a nice combination of cake. Worth a visit! Best Recommende
5
It's quite hard to find a good brunch place but I think I have found it! I just hope this place does not get too popular that it will be impossible to get a seat. They have good brunch, lunch and dessert food served here! We had the French toast which was AMAZING. The portion looks small but it will fill you up.Another recommendation is to try all the desserts and unique drinks they have. It is really worth the hype! If it's your birthday, you also get free cake! Remember to bring your ID for them to check. Go check this place out. No regrets!!!
4
If you want an Insta-worthy brunch place, this is the place to be. Also do look out for the instagram worthy drink which you'll never want to miss!
5
This is an affordable cafe with decent price on food. I like the breakfast and their quality cakes. It is normally busy on weekend.
5
Loved the pastas and desserts. The portion looked a little small at first but it was actually very filling.
5
The atmosphere was nice. The Duck Confit have a unique taste with the sauce. If they can improve the strawberry shortcake it will be better as the strawberries were in large pieces and it destroys the whole cake.
4
Chill place for brunch dates or gatherings. Great brunch food and desserts. Free cake on birthday week!
4
Simple & nice cafe with pleasant white ambience..coffee was nicely decorated with pic art, cakes are too pretty to be eaten (a bit too pricey tho')..love the daisy cake..
5
I really loved the food here and the decorations were so pretty!
The cakes are definitely worth trying!
3
They have beautiful, instagram worthy yummy cakes!Location is quite difficult to go if you don't have car or stay around the area. Service on a weekday late-afternoon was quite bad. No one acknowledged us and there were 3-4 service staff who were crowding around the cashier area and not attentive to customers. Only a male, friendly staff (maybe owner?) was seen busy attending to customers and clearing tables. He kinda made everything right after he came to us
4
Tried their Instagram worthy desserts and drinks which were delightful and pleasing on the eye but didn't get to try their main courses during my visit. Some of the instagram worthy desserts were not available. The cafe closes really early at 7pm (probably due to the lack of traffic to the area), with last order at 6pm, you have to be there early.
4
It was a wonderful visit to Boufe, food and service were really good! Drop by one rating because the coffee machine was coincidentally down that day and we ordered the Matcha latte instead but it turned out extremely sweet, which was a letdown. But still, the staff struck off our matcha lattes from the bill so service is really very good. Will definitely be back
5
Pleasant dining experience. We had the fish, carbonara, and the honey wings. I wouldn't really recommend the wings, though. Thanks for the free cake (you get one if it's your birthday week)! The place was a bit noisier than usual.
3
The main dishes were pretty average but the desserts didn’t only look good, they taste very good too.
5
Nice and quaint surroundings. Service is quite good, friendly staff. We had the all day breakfast and steak .. it’s quite good. The steak was nicely done (: The desserts are definitely insta-worthy so it’s worth a visit!
5
Perfect ambience for a gathering. Place is a little small though, hence cannot accommodate large crowd -but because of this, we get a more personalised service from the staff.
4
It was such a busy lunch hour ..
But was attended to quite fast . Food was served pretty fast .
Must try the Mexican corn ! It was so good !
4
Great ambience for a date, or to relax. Cakes looks awesome and taste good too. Food is good too. Maybe alittle pricey but overall the cakes were the best!
5
high quality food, affordable prices.
staffs are friendly too.
creative drinks are what we were there for!
3
The service is pretty good, the staff members are friendly - accommodated seating arrangements when it was really cold. The food however needed a lot more improvement, the “steaks are high” was extremely oily and the beef was unevenly cooked as well as not fresh at all. It was quite disappointing
4
We visited Boufe for weekend brunch and was able to get a table straight away. The crowd was pretty local/relatively young. The food was very nicely presented and cafe was bright and airy. They served some lovely small cakes which seemed to be the reason many people visited. The menu which could be described as all day brunch, even indicated which dishes were the most instagrammable! We tried the salmon croissant and granola. The granola unfortunately was way too sweet. The croissant was better. Pluses:- free parking outside the cafe- instagrammable foodMinuses:- fast service but waitress was pretty grumpyPrices seemed generally reasonable given the portion sizes.
4
Ordered their triple B main. Was overall a good set, very buttery on the eggs. Bacon was very honeyed. Thus not suitable if you do not like too much butter. With 2 sausages, the triple B was quite heavy on the stomach.Their Charcoal ice tea was unique with a distinct cucumber flavour. Price was overall ok. The galaxy cake is a little pricey at $12.90 but still worth as the experience was unique. The cakes tasted good as well. Quite worth the try definitely.Ohhh... not forgetting the awesome truffle fries
5
Interesting food. Especially their galaxy cake. The unicorn was also another noteworthy dessert. I didnt try any of their main.
4
Love this place! Been twice already and will definitely go back again. Love the milky way cake. Food is also nice. Nice environment as well
5
Ordered the tomato crab pasta & the eggs benedict - pasta was well cooked, while the broiche on the eggs ben could have been more toasted/grilled. Nonetheless, we will be back!
3
Visited the cafe at noon on a Friday with my husband and it was a cost place to be from the downpour outside. Chattering voices can get quite loud in this enclosed place and I couldn't make proper conversation with my husband as many people were very excited here....Ordered the steak and duck confit. When the duck confit arrived I could smell the pungent stench of mushrooms. It smelled awful and I nearly didn't want to touch my duck... anyway, eventually did and duck was tender and exterior a tad too fried crispy for my liking. I still prefer Saveur's duck confit and it's cheaper as well.Steak was alright as well.Nothing much to shout about since the food flavours didn't match the price point..
5
Came here for brunch for 3, they do not allow table reservations on weekends as it gets pretty crowded here; but they do allow venue bookings for private events, and this place does get booked up, from the displayed list of upcoming private events. The place is a quaint little cafe, with nice white washed walls and open windows the let the natural light flood in, lovely fairy lights strung across the windows, comfortable furniture, friendly and prompt staff. Food was quite good as well, and the desserts looked enticing but we were too full. Would come back again
5
The ambience is great and staff are friendly and courteous. The onion rings were slightly oily but the dish was certainly photo worthy as recommended. The cakes are really exquisite and it would be ideal if it could be larger in size so as to match with the price.
4
Excellent food especially the truffle fries. My eggs benedict dish was served with yummy thick toasts that were just delightfully sweet. Waiting time may be long depending on time of visit; there were too many customers for the three waiters to handle hence service took some time. Check for peak periods before going there; best to make a reservation beforehand! My best way to end the meal was their signature unicorn dessert! Must try
4
Went there for breakfast. Quite empty as it was a weekday morning. Ordered a egg Benedict and granola. The granola is very pretty and tasty. Egg Benedict is alright. No complain. Saw some cute cakes but too full to try. Would definitely return to try their other food and dessert.
4
Tried the pull pork, fish and chips, steak and salad with family of 4. Really enjoyed all the main courses, portion is also within expectations. The fries that came with the fish were also drizzled with truffle oil. The Caesar salad was generous in portion by local standards. Tried the Milky Way and strawberry short cake and both were excellent choices! Lychee tea was a good choice for beverage too.Ambience is casual and relaxed. Service was prompt and always with a smile once you are seated. However if you come on weekends, the cafe does not take reservations, so be prepared to wait up to 30mins during peak hours. They do not have many big tables for 4 and above, so you may need to wait even longer if you come in a big group. Parking is free at this location, quite a walk from main road if you are not driving. The entrance to Phoenix Park is directly opposite the Brunei embassy in Singapore, near Tanglin.

Hopped onto the shuttle bus from Redhill MRT to Phoenix Hill (check FB page for timings) and arrived in a jiffy. Made a reservation on chope, and was promptly shown to our table. The floor staff were extremely amiable, smiley and patient to answer our queries regarding the food/drink options. Our only qualm with this place was the waiting time for the food. Place was barely full (only 3-4 tables taken) and yet we still waited close to 40 mins for our orders. Thankfully, staff were very kind and the food quality was decent, with rather generous portions given. Is the waiting time to ensure we'd be hungry enough to finish all our food? Many people come here for the cakes, which we decided to pass on this time round. Decent trip!
5
Chill place and they serve nice and Creative cakes. Price right and quality of food is good. Ordered the truffles mushroom pasta and salmon crossiant. They even have outdoor for great photos. Will come back again.
4
Had a wonderful lunch at Boufe today. Great tasting food amidst cozy ambience. The friendly staff attended to us in the most courteous and attentive way. What a nice surprise to get a complimentary slice of cake for my birthday. Will definitely come again.
5
Carbonara is delicious and not too creamy unlike most cafes. Cakes are delicious too, especially strawberry shortcake. Food is a little bit more pricey if there is no discount. There is no queue on the day we went. Overall good experience.
5
Heard a lot about the photo worthy desserts. So I am pleasantly surprised that the main course are nice too.
5
Nice and quiet cafe on a weekday afternoon with lovely staff! Totally made my daughter little birthday celebration a memorable one..
4
Tucked in a quiet corner, this lovely place has a warm and cozy feel. The breakfast meals are filling and well presented. The ambience and great food makes this place an unforgettable one. Will be back again.
5
Went here 2 days ago for afternoon tea and we are surprised by this cafe. The place is so homie for hamgout place. You have to try the Unicorn Cake and the milkyway cake!! We went there at 4pm and the Unicorn Cake only 3 slices left. We will be back for sure
4
As I went on an off-peak weekday afternoon, the staff were attentive & friendly. Gotten a free cake 3 days before or after your BD & was lucky that the cakes are on promo at $4 each. Although the cake tasted pretty normal but definitely instagram worthy. Their mains are pretty awesome. Tried TripleB & steak. Esp love the honey glazed Bacon
5
Situated just behind Orchard/Tanglin and nestled in the lush greenery of the parks around the area, Boufe Cafe is a place worth its visit and your way getting there. Dishes are presented beautifully and tasted as beautiful too! Compliments to the chef/kitchen crew for making that huge effort and perfected the taste! Desserts are not just pretty but wonderful with taste too! Great location for catch up or dates!
5
I came here after seeing the rave reviews on the food and cakes and was not disappointed. Had a great time with my partner and we thoroughly enjoyed our food and the pretty cakes are going at $4 on weekdays. Worth a visit but a hassle to get there on public transport.
4
Beautiful place for OOTD and lazing the afternoon away with dainty cakes. Came for the Unicorn and Galaxy Cakes which surprisingly tasted as good as they looked!
Savoury items were ok; would recommend coming for the desserts.
4
Friendly staff with really well designed and pretty cakes! Love the deco of the place as well~ Thanks for the free bday cakes! :)
4
I didn't even know about this place. Quiet leafy area close to the city.
The cafe had a simple minimalist design all white with clean lines. Nice dessert selection and good for an afternoon reading.
5
The ambience created by the staff was excellent. The food arrived promptly and the service was excellent.
4
Nice and clean ambience. Nice food and price is reasonable. Service wad good too compare to other cafe in sg. Free birthday mini cake on my bday which came as a surprise:) had a good and relax time with my husband.
4
The cafe has a quaint ambience. The signature swing was indeed an instagrammable spot for many. Apart from the delicious savoury mains, the desserts were splendid too, especially the unicorn cake and boufe cake!
3
Popped by during lunch with a friend, and the mains were rather average, given we have been visiting a couple of cafes while I'm in Singapore.That said, I think they performed quite well in their desserts, looks gorgeous and taste great as well. Guess it would be perfect for tea or light catchup with my friends, but not for lunch if I'm looking for a meal
4
The cafe is reachable by bus and some walks. It's a little bit hidden but it's really worth a visit. The cafe currently provides privilege for birthday boy/girl with a free cake on visit within the birthday week. If you are lucky, you'll have a Unicorn! The dishes are delicious too!
5
First visit was during the night. Romantic ambience. Second visit is during the day. Totally different and i prefer the day ambience more. Nice to chill and of cause a good play to take photos of watches. Lighting is beyond words. And the backyard was amazing ! Beside the ambience food was good too. Esp the unicorn cake. Much love for that and twilight drink is suoer refreshing for humid weather in sg will be back for more
1
Just received my meal from the cafe via uber eats. 2 hours to arrive then when it gets here only one dish is delivered. No one bothered to contact us so what do they think we're going to do? Just watch one person eat and the other sit there?The food looks terrible as well, will never ever visit this place or order here again. This is my Norwegian salmon with hash potatoes for $19!
4
Nice cafe with beautiful food!
The service staff were very attentive to us as we have a baby with us. They placed us at a quiet corner so that the baby won't be too distracted.
We love the pull pork burger and the Daisy cake!
4
For a cafe, the food is nice with awesome appearance. Their dessert is a must try when u visit. Their main course is nice too. Lots of instargram worthy food.
3
The main dish was good & reasonable ,staff is friendly , cake was so so but great for instagram which I believe is a must order when you are here
4
This nice ambiance cafe was located at a ulu part of Tanglin area. The cafe has indoor and outdoor dining. The food are nice and the cakes are really yummy. This is a nice place to relax, eat and chit chat with friends or partner.
4
Love this dining place and will be back for more cakes . Service staff was friendly and helpful. The unicorn cake is a must try .

BoufeSo the French name inspired a sense of romance on a weekend morning. The experience was just a tad short of that.The restaurant has white interiors - the walls, the tables and chairs, the bar, white plastic flowers on the table, white bar stools (you also must be wearing white when eating here - kidding!) and with long windows in all four walls makes the place bright and lively. The only small downside is that it's one large dining area and being a family place also with just very happy people, makes it a tad noisy- so not a place for a quiet breakfast. There is an adjacent smaller & what seemed a quieter section as well, if you fancy.We only had drinks here so I can't review the quality and taste of food. Food is priced between 14-20 dollars and desserts/snacks are lower. They have some interesting drinks on the menu. I had a 'Dawn to Dusk' with chamomile tea, lavender and edible silver dust - two of 3 are my favourites. The silver dust made it shimmy after (kidding again). I took a picture with my review but that doesn't do the drink justice. The one thing that caught my attention was a salted variant of the Caramel Latte- 'salted Caramel Latte' ! Interesting.. I thought!Travel Tip- not ideal for a quiet breakfast. No outdoor seating
5
Interesting food serving in a all white theme restaurant. Bright and cheery place and their staff were attentive. We tried an array of food, drinks and cakes. The salmon croissant $17 was wonderful and the salmon was not too salty which I like. The chef accommodated our request to present the dish the way we like it, thumbs up for that! The pull pork with egg Benedict $19 was also good, I like the egg Benedict the best, while the pull pork was favourful, it's a tad spicy for me as I don't really like chilli or pepper. The bread was a bit too hard, I will change it to croissant the next time. The new addition to the menu duck confit $18 was ok nothing to shout portion a little small for me. Their cakes are really pretty though small serving but enough to tantalize the taste bud. Milky Way $8.50 was pretty and yummy not too sweet just nice, the unicorn $9 was a tad too sweet for me. The strawberry cake $8 was fresh with lots of fresh strawberries I like it. I didn't pay close attention to the ingredients used for the cakes but I recall the taste of white chocolate cream and mango purÃ©e in both the milky way and Unicorn. Love their drinks from Dawn to dust $7, a multi-colored drink with a tinge of lavender taste which was quite refreshing. I would consider the food on the pricier side if you don't mind the indulgence. Overall great service and good experience. Check out their menu on their website
4
Came here on Sat afternoon and it was full despite being in an ulu area... The lady who asked us to wait at the outdoor area was friendly but the service staff were not really friendly and one even had a sulky face... Tried the fries, milkyway and unicorn cakes... not too bad. Personally I prefer the milkyway as it has more layered flavours. I might come back here again to try their main
5
Came on a weekday and was surprised at the crowd (about 50% full) despite its remote location. Ordered the mushroom pasta ($14) and the pull pork eggs ben ($19). The mains were decently sized with copious amount of mushroom and very delicious! Also ordered the milky way cake for dessert, however I can only say the taste falls short on its looks. Very instagrammable but tastes like your average cake, pricy too, I must say. If not driving, there's a shuttle bus to the phoenix park from Redhill mrt bus stop (there's only one directly outside red hill mrt). Do check the bus times before dropping by!
5
We visited Boufe just recently. We tried main course and snack - Tripple B and smoke salmon salad, dessert - strawberry shortcake and milky way, beverages - Cappuccino, butterscotch latte and latte. The food was decent and the coffee was nice. As for the dessert, strawberry shortcake is really good, there's a faint alcohol after taste and it's full of fresh strawberry, very light and refreshing. However, milky way is not to our liking, it's very pretty to look at, however it's too creamy for us. Overall, it's a nice place to visit and spend your afternoon away.
5
The cafe was really nice and peaceful for a brunch, the food serving was huge. Food was yummy and staff were friendly and helpful. Enjoyed my trip there.🤗
2
Service was good but food was disappointing and not value for money. Location was also diffcult to get to without a car
4
beautify setting though difficult to access. enjoyed the brunch here as well - eggs ben were nicely done. price is on point too with nothing over $20. service was friendly and prompt. recommended.
3
We were there for lunch, ordered the pulled pork eggs benedict and triple b big breakfast. We were not impressed with the food, probably won't be back for the food. The cafe location is nice and quiet and service is good.
5
Couple taking photos on the swing outside the cafe, cakes are cute, unique and sweet feelings. Staff are friendly, good service. Have a great time there and surprise complimentary cake for my special day!
5
Thoughtfully prepared cakes like mini unicorn and Milky Way. These are their signature cakes. We tried the twilight tea with the fusion colour technique as well. Overall good service with reasonable price
5
it was a pleasant experience there, the staff was very polite ahd the overall experience for me and my girlfriend was fantastic. would recommend this place !
5
The food was fantastic and the place was so beautiful in the afternoon ☺️ The service staff was extremely helpful and friendly too.
5
Good service and environment. Very happy that my Friend enjoy it and we celebrated her birthday at Boufe
5
A gem in an area sorely lacking of good food choices, providing fav brunch options at much, much, more affordable prices than typical brunch spots. On top of the reasonable pricing, quality and taste is not compromised. Portions are generous too!Will definitely be coming back to try the whole menu which intrigues me, as unfortunately I only had the space for 1 pasta this time. The wait staff were lovely too, actively seeking customers' feedback on food
4
Food was good but service by the staff was even better. Although the waiting time was super long... Waited almost 1 hour for my food but I guess was probably due to them having a promotion that day...
3
Food had some hits and misses. Was very crowded so long wait for the food. But the cakes were pretty good. Service crews were nice too. Love the ambience too
3
Was here for dinner and menu choice is nothing fantastic. The usual pasta and 3 other mains. Truffle mushroom pasta is good, beef was too gamey in taste.
5
Love the coffee here. It tasted so special. Always come here for their coffee and cake. The strawberry short cake is especially yummy!
5
Best Brioche French toast ever!!! It was served with creme fraische, crispy banana, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries! The crunchies on top were tasty too! The Pear Persimmons tea was to die for! I highly recommend this out of the way, quaint, and tasty cafe for brunch, breakfast, or lunch!
3
Food looks and smells amazing. Decided to get 2 mains and a dessert. The French toast was nice but the caramelised bananas were burnt. The twilight drink was really magical! The colours were vibrant and the colour changing left me in awe.I'm a huge elderflower fan but the taste of the twilight... let's just say it's pretty to look at and leave it at that. Taste was so disappointing. $7 for a drink that's tasted so bland was sad.Place was a little hard to find but so pretty and clean. Ambience was quiet and quaint. Service took awhile but the wait was alright. Didn't like that while eating, the staff came to clear some little glasses and things without saying a word. It was a little rude. I was fine but I might not consider bringing people who are particular about dining etiquette because of that. This didn't only happen to my table but a few others as well. Overall, not too sure if I'd come back for seconds
4
Boufe is located in the quiet Phoenix Park. Despite the slight inaccessibility, I love the ambience and service. Have visited three times and enjoyed their brunch and coffee.Would like to recommend this unassuming croissant from Triple B (in their brunch menu), which has totally captured my heart. Croissant is one of the hardest pastry to make and good croissants are even more rare. This one is soft, fluffy but not flaky. A pity, good things come small but you can always order ala carte for $1.20/pc
4
I went there on a friend's recommendation and did not regret the long, hot walk in.Boufe has separate brunch and dinner menus. I was there for lunch and so ordered their huge breakfast platter (forgot what it's called on the menu) with mushrooms, bacon, sausages, eggs and croissant. It was yummy and satisfying. However, what I really appreciated was the salted caramel latte. The coffee was really good. I've been thinking about going back for a second cup ever since
4
Ordered a citron tart, boufe cake (their signature) and green tea mont blanc. Citron tart was pretty good with a refreshing taste, and boufe cake was rich in chocolate but the passionfruit well-complemented its taste so it's not so sweet. The green tea mont blanc looked really cute for its appearance but not so much for its taste as there's too much matcha cream. Not much to rave for but overall the tarts and cake are not bad
4
Went there on a Sunday evening for dinner, quiet location and the interior was beautifully decorated. With an alfresco and indoor dining. Ambience was nice and I got a seat beside one of the windows which had great natural light, awesome for taking photos. The menu was rather interesting, with a special drink which changed in colour as you mix it with the syrup. Food portion was generous for the price. Overall a great location to hang back and enjoy each other's company.
