Found the lid bar in the lonely planet, didn‚Äôt disappoint. Good staff + good cocktails + good tunes = good night out üòÄ‚ù§Ô∏è

I came here twice, and maybe 3rd and more. Great place to hang out with friends/colleagues and even biz partners. Nice music, the drinks are awesome and the atmosphere is really great. I love it when the staffs are like family to each other :)
5
Great air conditioning to greet you and after that, some of the best, most interesting concoctions I have ever had!!! A great staff that instantly made us feel welcome.
4
Lovely little haunt!
Awesome cocktails, knowledgeable and friendly staff.
Huge drink list - plenty to choose from but the staff will help you through it - just tell them what you like!
Great digs and open early till late
Will definitely go again!
5
bitters & love is the best bar, bar none. see the pun i did there? fully customizable cocktails, impeccable service and great GREAT vibes. didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t expect this level of goodness from one tiny place. special shoutouts to stephanie and sarah who are excellent hosts. kaya toast cocktail a little too sweet for me even though its the most popular. the char siew pizza is to die for.

We stumbled across this place whilst searching for a Singapore Sling. Bear in mind that it's quite difficult to spot the entrance as there's no proper sign - however, it's worth seeking out! The Kaya Toast cocktail was one of the best and most unique cocktails I've ever had. Absolutely delicious! We had that and a really good Singapore Sling, which set us back about $25 each (Singapore dollars). We wished we could have stayed for more but our schedule and budget didn't allow it :( staff were really lovely and friendly too! Definitely worth a visit
4
Was there last weekend with my colleagues and it was just wow! The place was nicely decorated and the vibes were just awesome. Their drinks selection won't disappoint you at all. We had a little chit chat with the bartenders before they were wrapped up again on a weekend night. In conclusion, the service was excellent and the cocktails we had were beyond our expectations. Keep it up, guys
5
This place is a lovely gem. I had some of the best cocktails I've ever had in my entire life here. The menu has a big selection of drinks that all seem delicious. What makes this place even better is the outstanding service. The bartenders and servers are super knowledgeable and friendly. I suggest you ask the bartenders for drink suggestions, you won't be disappointed. Super romantic and chill vibe

Paloma ($23+)Kaya Toast Cocktail ($25+)Can't speak much for the former because I only had a few sips of it (which I enjoyed). Drank most of the latter & here's what I think of it:The Kaya was delicious, & I also appreciate the thickness & slight crispness of the toast. The cocktail itself wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be. Probably won't order it again because honestly, I ordered it because it's novel, interesting, & local. Also, the cocktail menu here is quite extensive, you can also let the bartenders whip up something for you depending on your preference. So the next time I come here, I'll probably get something else.There aren't many seats here; in the small (cosy) space they have, it can get pretty crowded. The music is also really loud, so if you want to catch up/chit chat with your date/friend(s), this might not be the best place to be. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats  No GS
5
Yes, y'all, the cocktails are pricy however it is Singapore and you are totally getting what you are paying for. The menu these mixologists have put together is incredible. My fiancee and I throughly enjoyed our experience from the bar food to the unique concoctions. Fiona was a gracious host and made us feel at home. When we come back to Singapore we will definitely pay a return visit!
3
Overpriced cocktails with a twist. The interiors need some updating as my chair was wobbly for the entire evening.
I cannot fully recommend it at the price point.
4
What a great little spot in Singapore. Great place to go with people, enjoy there great cocktail selection unwind and shoot the breeze. This is a must do when in Singapore enjoy the atmosphere and you will be back. Enjoy
5
This place deserves a write up! It is not your typical cocktail bar - concealed, great music, excellent service and really delicious cocktails. Thanks to fiona for recommending your new cocktail menu! Try the nonya confession!
5
If you are looking for somewhere to hang out, bitters & love has great music and cocktails. Be awed by the Moroccan gun powder uses fire to prepare your cocktail.
5
The place does not see much from the road but it is one of its features!
When you are inside, try the Kaya Toast and let us advise you!
For me was a great discovery!
5
New (ish) location is great. Fabulous cocktails, unpretentious, great atmosphere. This is one of my favourites.
5
Best bar in singapore. Hands down. Love their cocktails. Great atmosphere and friendly staff! All in all we spent abt $23 per cocktail. Also try their burgers and nachos.
5
we had a fantastic time here at unassuming bar in singapore. the drinks were good, place is cosy, the music is good, prices are reasonably priced and service was top notch.
3
If this was in any other city I'd give this 2 stars and what I mean by that is its Singapore so everything is expensive but this place seems especially so. We had cocktails and some nibbles and it cost more than I'd expect to pay for a dinner. I also booked ahead via email and they had no record of me - managed to get a table but that was luck rather than good management. Overall I left feeling a bit underwhelmed and cheated.

2013 May 17-18 @Bitters & Love. Recently Started Review On TripAdvisor. This May Be OutDated But I Still Wish To Share Because My Experience Through Photos.This Place Was Introduce By My Friend, Michelle. Celebration Of SY's Birthday, Who Visited SG With Vicky From Penang.My First Unique Experience, Asking For A Drink List And The Reply Is "Don't Have". Have Tried Japanese Omakase Meal But Never For Drink We Either State What We Feel Like Having, Or Our Mood, Then Leave It To Bartenders To Prepare For Us. Great Experience & We Enjoyed All Our Drinks Very Much
3
As a Cufflink Club and 28 HKS regular, I had high hopes for this place. With blasting music, overpriced and unimpressive cocktails. I'll stick to Cufflink and 28HKS thank you.
4
Best place in the city for a great cocktail after dinner. Pricey, but the cocktails quality deserves, as well as the service
5
This hideaway bar does great cocktails with a local twist. We ordered their signature kaya cocktail made with kaya is a local coconut jam. It's like having breakfast in a cocktail. Yummy especially those with a sweet tooth. Great stuff!
5
One of the best bar we been to. Excellent cocktails made to measure. Mangosteen is in season so bartenders made mangosteen Martini. Great selection of whisky and premium gin.
5
It took quite a few trips up and down the street before we spotted the small sign to this bar, but we were so glad we managed to find it. Bitter & Love has a fantastic atmosphere, good music and great decor. The bar staff obviously enjoy making new cocktail creations, and the ones they made for us were really delicious (even if they were a little on the pricey side!). The sliders we had as bar snacks were yummy. We'll definitely be going back
3
We found Bitters and Love under bar section. It's hidden away through a 'Speakeasy ' door. Great music and bar staff enjoying their jobs. Cocktails were ok - nibbles average. If you are expecting glitz this is not the place for you. If you want a great buzz then choose here
5
IF you want to spend couple of hours enjoying great cocktails, from most traditional to more adventurous, this is THE place. The menu offer plenty choice but the best is to speak with bar tenders and tell them which kind of drink or spirits you like and they are super happy to make some special editor only for you. They use alchemist objects and fire creating not only superb drinks but also the mot astonishing athmosphere you would like to have as draining experience
4
small bar, along the street - very cool cocktail list made it super hard to decide. settled for a yummy drink which i now cannot recall. the staff give good service - left a jug of ice water after being asked for refills.. haha. would return to try the other drinks. not noisy that you can't talk, so overall a good place to meet and drink
5
From the moment I stepped through the door I felt right at home. I received a warm welcome, help picking out the perfect drink from their amazing, creative cocktail list ....and a thoughtful overview from the proprietors of the best "local" things to be sure to do and see. To top it off, the staff sincerely seem to enjoy working there, which is always a true sign of a great place
5
Bitters and love is a speakeasy cocktail bar hidden behind a small door. The atmosphere is smoky and dark, very intimate and cocktails are amazing. There is even a backdoor after the bathroom where you can go outside to smoke a cigarette if you need to. If you don't know what cocktails to take, just take a Gin Tonic, it is simple and served with fresh cucumber slices , delicious!
5
We have no idea where to begin. We had so much fun. great service, fantastic cocktails, music we were dancing and swaying to and great food. Try their homemade burgers and skinny pizza.
5
Best coffee in town, Free the Robot is run by pros. Authentic artists at work. This place is a gem their regulars know.
5
Came here after our long flight, great atmosphere for drinks, drinks are also pretty good. They have music playing and people socializing in late hours. Great for after dinner drinks to come and chill.
5
I can see why this cosy place is ranked highly. Fantastic cocktails, with vast selection, innovative & tasty drinks. Four bartensers behind the bar, young, casual & vibrant place. Bar bites, triffle roasted potatoes are made from potatoa and not frozen.
5
We stopped by as we had read the excellent reviews on trip advisor and weren't disappointed! We walked past it twice before noticing the sign and distinctive door! The cocktails were fantastic, the bartenders customise them depending on your tastes and we had some wonderful drinks. The staff make you feel really welcome and the atmosphere is brilliant, with some great music and atmospheric lighting. They also serve a range of cocktails from a menu of you prefer to know what you will get. There is tapas available although we only drank so can't comment. If you're after somewhere to try some 'hip' cocktails, so try this place out! It's not cheap ($20-$25 a drink) but worth every penny in my opinion as the drinks are made with fresh, local ingredients
5
Wow wow wow what a place!!! The concept is awesome, chose your base( vodka, rum, etc) chose how you like it ( sweet, fruity, sour, etc) and let them do their magic!!! We had the best drinks!!! We went back again the next day!The drinks are served in different cool glasses each time and it is just an all around amazing experience
5
we have never had better cocktails and we have seen many good bars around the world. we started with white spirits trying their customized cocktails and classics. we had one cocktail with gin, chartreuse and midori and that was out of this world and well balanced. the staff is knowledgeable, approachable and extremely helpful. though we wish the guy with the cap would smile abit more. worth every dollar spent
5
Singapore's most unassuming bar. there is a hoarding on outside that makes the place looks under construction and only tell tale sign is the light shining above the door. Beyond the door transforms into another world and a pretty marble top bar with dim lights, exposed wall and a tree branch hanging across the airwell. That said they serve cocktails that are well crafted and bringing out the flavours of the spirits. Food is limited but each dish hit the right spot. Seafood pizza is served with succulent prawns and burger is delicious with homemade buns and patty
5
Enter this special little cocktail bar, sit down and allow yourself to be introduced to new drinks and flavours. A very personal little bar, with hand crafted cocktails and a great ambiance. Sarah will come and help you choose the drink that suits your tastes and her broad experience will also help you to discover new drinks you never knew existed. Go give it a try!
5
a tad hard to find as the facade had a hoarding. it was negroni week so we decided to try the nazgroni, a twist of the classic. well balanced drink and the smoke gave it a nice flavor to the drink. for dinner, service staff recommended the tiger prawn pasta made with lobster stock and burger. both dishes were good and tasty
5
We have been to Bitters & Love three times and each time it surpasses our expectations. Love the music and service. They recently revamped their dinner menu. Ask for their burgers with sunny side up eggs and bacon.
5
This a fun place. The staff are excellent and they really make the place. The cocktails are good and innovatively served in a variety of different presentations. We come here often although it's getting harder to get a seat as it's becoming very popular.
5
It was birthday celebration and we had an amazing time! Our waitress was friendly and took care of us so well. Cocktails were great and bar snacks too. Its better to make a reservation as we had to wait for a table.
4
You would walk past this place so easy! It's lovely on the inside, cool decor and great drinks. Music can be too loud to maintain comfortable conversation though.
5
Quite expensive place, but really nice and friendly staff. Had the best drinks ever there and would go there definitely again!!!
3
The cocktails here tasted good, but the place was way too cramped for comfort. Came here with a few gal pals and we found ourselves having to jostle through drunk people at the bar in order to get to the toilet, and the bar seats were also not very comfortable. When a table left, we were moved to the sofa/booth seats instead, but the lighting over the booth was too bright I find, and rather than being able to just chill and relax, we felt a little exposed. Honestly was a pity that the environment is a far cry from the standards we expected from all our bar crawls in Hong Kong. This was unfortunate, as we really did like the cocktails, but probably wont be back due to the ambience
5
great place to go for an after dinner drink in this part of town.Let the guys at the bar do their job. just let them know what sort of drinks you want and you won;t be disappointed. nice mix of patrons.don't tell too many people or it will become too crowded
5
We happened to walk past along telok ayer and we were curious about the nondescript frontage, opened the door and to our surprise we felt like we were taken to another place. Drinks were creative and hit the right spot. Try the Kaya toast cocktail if you have a sweet tooth. Music was a tad loud for us but everyone seemed to be having a good time
5
we accidentally discovered this gem on our way to moosehead on telok ayer street. so decided to pop by after dinner. we were greeted by friendly staff who explained the cocktail menu and how we can customize the cocktails according to our preference. we wanted something strong and not sweet and when the drinks - a twist of the boulevardeier (not sure how you spell it) and it was spot on. will definitely return for more
5
A laid-back bar with a touch of timelessness in the form of mellow R&B tunes. I tried their famous Kaya Toast Cocktail ($23), Moroccan Gun Powder ($27), and a bit of my friend's drinks, all of which were not at all disappointing. The interior of the place is peculiar albeit magical, they've got some creative inventions and the service is very friendly. Drinks are fairly pricy, but worth a try! I really admire this hidden gem; a definite recommendation
4
I am a Malibu pineapple lover and they do have one of the best :D The tapas is really delicious too but a little bit pricy. Enjoy the environment very well, relaxing and chill:)
5
great craft cocktails in a really nice laid back unpretentious atmosphere. a local place with a bit of speakeasy vibe to it. cocktails were fun, tasty and inventive.
5
Amazing well balanced and carefully crafted cocktails. They serve up great food to graze on and place has awesome vibe. Our favorite cocktails of singapore trip.
5
If there is one cocktail bar to go in Singapore, we highly recommend Bitters & Love. The bartenders have good knowledge of their alcohol and spot on our drinks. We spent just under $75 for 3 drinks including taxes which was well worth it.
5
Just a stop-by for a drink but ended up with 2 drinks. I was thrilled with the Moroccan Gun Powder...spicy, tense, warm enough to sooth my mind after hard days work.
Will be back when I'm around
3
I went with friends and the service was superb. However I'm not a cocktail person and felt those were very very sweet. Innovative but too sweet and fruity. My girl friends loved it though. It was very loud on a Friday night so I suggest go somewhere else if you prefer a quiet time with wine or whiskey.
4
Literally a hole in the door to peep through marks this small cocktail bar. Walked straight past it the first time but glad we tracked back to it. Unassuming and once inside relaxed. Had 2 first day staff who were keen and cheerful. Was pretty dark (used phone at one stage) but adds to the overall feel. Would recommend getting the "made up" cocktail. Presentation fantastic and tasted great. We had food as well which was good but not awesome. The Wagyu beef cubes were presented well but a little tough. Truffle chips were yummy though. Give it a tr
5
Loved this place. Went there for the first time for pre drinks for my birthday. Ended up staying there for the majority of the evening! A good place to go and have a good cocktails made for you and just chill with your friends. A good ambience!
5
this bar is not the easiest bar to find however just look out for free the robot hoarding. once inside we are taken into another realm. the waitstaff were friendly, patient and explained the menu telling us the profiles of their housecocktails. we had a really good time and enjoyed the kaya toast and love stone cocktail. wagyu beef cubes and prawn gambas are delicious. great job guys. we will definitely be back
4
I've been here three or four times here and had various cocktails, and even let the maestro make one up for me from the selections you can make.It's ok when it's not too busy, but it's very dark - in fact too dark. When your customers have to use their phones to light up the menus then your interior designer needs sacking.But, it's fairly well designed, for Singapore it's cutting edge, for Hoxton it's an antique!Go to see the decor, and the amazing drinks maker who revels in his job...one for the ladies or the boys.However, I've not tried the food, and there is one cocktail that comes in one of those bags that you can get a drink in here in Singapore. Sadly, it's hung on some wire contraption and looks like a colostomy bag with a straw!So, advice to owners: sort your lights, and bin the colostomy bags. Oh, and although I like attentive staff, it's a fine line between attentive and looking as if you need the tips
5
Many thanks to staff for great proffessional service !!! Ofcourse the food and coctails was top notch as well , thanks for wondreful experience
5
This place is unique, providing a nice interior design, food and drink are elegant and classy . service does not disappoint. and everything was very neat and nice
5
While this place is not easy to find - you are likely to miss the small unassuming entrance as you pass by- inside you will get cocktails that are simply outstanding . You just tell your base spirit and what taste you would like and the amazing bartenders come up with their own innovations . And the snacks are also quite tasty - we specially liked the truffle fried chips. A small place and getting a table would be difficult.
5
Have been reading the review all over TA as well as Singapore local magazines. Finally decided to give it a try, walk in without reservation on a Friday night. The place wasn't too crowded but perhaps it was because nearly xmas holiday thus a lot of people are away. I'd assume. The bar is on the right hand side of Telok Ayer Street. It is a shop house but you can find it by looking a white door with a small post box with Bitters & Love written on it. Soonest you enter, you will see a narrow, low light dimmed setting with bar setting on the left and few tables on the right. The meeter greeter (female - i forgot her name) was quite friendly. Because we didnt rsvp thus we were seated at the bar. She asked if this is our first time to Bitters & Love or not, if so, then she will explain the option on order the cocktail. Coktail menu is quite vary but easy to understand. You can either order B&L cocktails menu or you can create your own by choosing your liquor base then flavors, etc to the bartender. There were 2 bartenders when we visits B&L and both of them are awesome! They are friendly and clearly articulated the cocktail options when we asked. They also gave great suggestions for our drinks option. I am a BIG fan of Moscow Mule. So far i have been searching for a good Moscow Mule in the city. Found 2 places already and this one also served a kicking one! Thus, now i have 3 places that could serve a fantastic Moscow mule.Music were great when we came (R&B) but then they changed it to quite a love mellow tunes. Then, my friend requested the lady (greeter/ or perhaps she is manager, not sire) to change it. Then music went back On and awesome. Faster beats i mean ... Not a heartbreaking songs. Not sure if they serve bar snacks since we came quite late around 10:30 and we weren't hungry. The drink range is $24-30 if I'm not mistaken. But I'd say they are worth it. yes - i will definitely come again and totally recommending this hidden gem to those who are after one or a lot of good cocktails in the city.

After reading good reviews about this place, i decided to take my boyfriend here for dinner since it was his birthday. The place was packed due to an ongoing event but we were lucky we came early so we were able to get a table. The staff were very attentive and explains the menu well especially the drinks selection. We had the angus and chicken steak. Being a not so big-eater, the serving is just right for us. Boyfriend liked the beef but he didnt like his chosen drink. Mine was the chicken and the kaya toast cocktail which were both ok. Wasnt able to take good photos coz of the lighting which they can consider improving. The price on the menu is net, GST added and no service charge. Overall, the visit was ok.
4
I've been here a few times now and it doesn't disappoint. The basic concept is they serve their own cocktail inventions, and/or tailorize them to your own particular taste. They also do new twists on classics if you want to play safe. It is expensive here however, so not the kinda place you come to on a budget
5
Wife and I headed to Bitters & Love for date-night. The nondescript front door is hard to miss. Just remember that the boarded up front window is artfully done, and the door has a peephole looking in.Once in the door, we were in another world. We were offered a seat at the low bar counter, and drinks and food choices and specials were explained. We came for the drinks and the drinks were what took our breath away. Choose your base liquor [eg Gin, Whiskey, Rum] and tell your bar tender how you like it. For example, your favoured brand of gin, and if you like it sweet, sour or 'surprise me'. The wife and I had 3 drinks each, with an extra one which we took away. We felt like a local spin of the 'teh-tarik' you get at the 'mamak' [Indian muslim "pulled" tea]. This was an off-menu item, but can be done if they have the supplies; And they did!Our other drinks were Whiskey, Gin, and even a dessert based item. it was wonderful to come into a bar and be surprised by the beautiful drinks seemingly created in the spot. We loved the energy of the place and the wait staff and bar team were just amazing.Food-wise was pretty good. We would go with the western dishes the next time we come back, particularly the spaghetti prawns.A great find and we will certainly be back
5
I love a good craft cocktail, so when I was staying at a hotel on Telok Ayer Street the first thing I did after getting a wifi signal was to search for cocktail bars nearby. Bitters & Love was only a minute's walk away and having checked out some online reviews I knew it'd be the type of place I'd enjoy!As other people have commented it's a little bit hard to find but once you step through the door into the dimly lit interior you're guaranteed to smile - the staff are really friendly, the music is great, and the wall of spirits is full of possibilities! Special thanks to Sarah for making us at home - she gave us some great tips on places to explore during our holiday, and told us which dishes on the Bitters & Love menu were the best. Yes, the pizza was really good, and the trio of burgers that my wife had were really nice too, I'm told!Anyway, the food's good but it's not the real reason to visit Bitters & Love, of course - that'd be the COCKTAILS. There's a menu with some interesting choices among the classics, but it's more fun to go off menu and ask the bar staff to get creative. Tell them a few flavours or styles that you like (smoky, fresh, complex, whatever) and they'll make something individual for you. They're very creative and knowledgeable and they seem to enjoy a challenge. We had some truly amazing drinks here, among the best cocktails we've ever had, and we had fun sitting at the bar and chatting to the staff - they're not at all pretentious, like some cocktail bar staff can be.Bitters & Love was so good that we made it our "local" during our holiday in Singapore, and visited four times in all. If you're in the area, don't miss it
5
Visited this cool venue while catching up with friends and was not disappointed. The staff are friendly and helpful and I loved my vodka with lemongrass, lime and ginger. Just let them know your favourite tipple and they will suggest what to add to the mix!!There is a really chilled vibe to the place and I would definitely recommend a visit. I will be back for more next time I'm in Singapore
5
This is pretty tough to find, but luckily we had a guide book to tell us where to go! It was a door in the street - with nothing to tell you what you'll find the other side, but when you get in there you'll see beautiful cocktail creations, friendly staff and a great, broody/hipster vibe with decent music and some serious tasty drinks
4
Bitters & Love has a great environment for a fun night out with friends. Patrons select the type of liquor and a flavor (fruity, refreshing, etc) and the mixologists create a custom cocktail. Drinks are good, but food is average.
4
Small, dimly lit, hard to find but so worth it. Mixologists add a twist of their own to your favourite cocktail. There was a limited range of eats but we enjoyed our beef sliders and truffle mash Cheeseballs. Cheery service
5
Cool space, great selection of spirits. Although it may be tricky to find, Bitters and Love is well worth a visit. The hidden space leads to an awesome space with good music and more importantly great cocktails!
5
we were here during f1 weekend. their house cocktails were amazing from kaya toast cocktail to death by chocolate. if you are feeling more adventurous go for the customise cocktails. good food too. try the beef cubes, meat ball pasta and char siu pizza.
5
Yes, it's a clever marketing ploy to keep the entrance obscure, but once inside & seated at the bar, you'll agree the bartenders & their bespoke cocktails deliver. The focused attention to detail & practiced movement of all 3 experts behind the bar evoked sushi chefs. I probably could've ordered a better pairing than the refreshing Monkey 47 gin/lime/grenadine/framboise & the umami-bomb wagyu sliders, but both were satisfying. As other reviewers have said, you can go with a classic cocktail or simply choose your spirit & specify whether you want something fruity, spicy, smoky, etc. - sort of a cocktail omekase. Service was friendly despite the crowd - arrive early, or expect a scrum
5
A little hard to find but their neighbors were kind enough to point us to right place. We wanted to cover a few bars that night but we ended up staying for more cocktails. Well crafted and delicious cocktails. Atmosphere and music, lighting were perfect and crowd was pretty trendy on a Thursday night
5
From the minute you step inside the cute little door with the peep hole, you instantly feel welcomed! Sera is so lovely and spent time with us explaining the in's and outs of Singapore, recommending places to eat and things to see. Hubby and i ordered a cocktail each to begin with which was delicious and then our second cocktail, we left it upto the mixologists' to surprise us. We were not dissapointed. The 2nd cocktail was better than the first. A truly special place, where u can sit up at the bar watching your cocktails be made from fresh fruit only (no flavourings) When we are next in Singapore we will definately be back. Thank you to all the staff at Bitters & Love for great pre dinner drinks. Lisa & Sam

... The mixology is so good here they could probably turn that title into a cocktail!This is a great bar which specialises in cocktails and also has a great range of straight drinks, beers etc.You need to know the address or be some kind of miraculously sharp-eyed punter to be able to find the bar, a very subtle sign over the door well above eyeline is the only thing that gives it away - otherwise this would only be just another boarded up worn down shopfront. When you gather up the courage to walk through the door you find yourself in a buzzing, funky bar - high end and underground dive all at once, with sprinklings of an American speakeasy during the time of prohibition!The cocktail menu is extensive, with some great ready designed cocktails - and if you are up for it you can also ask the bartender to mix you a custom made cocktail. Absolutely delicious! The bartenders can also make your own personal cocktail requests. You'll be amazed at their superb technique, watch them long enough and you'll see them use the 'blue flame technique' - one way to remove the hairs off their arms!They also serve beers, sodas etc for those who don't want a cocktail. I can understand why this one ends up being a favourite of so many, we'll be going back!In terms of food there are some nibbles, and a menu but the quality of menu and ingredients is not on a par with the drinks. We had the oysters (great), the nachos (ok - salsa was delicious, guacamole and cheese dip tasted artificial), the grilled wagyu beef cubes (fatty) and the truffle fries (nice, but chunky). Based on the snacks we decided to eat elsewhere - it wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't special, particularly when there are so many good food places close by at Duxton Hill - which was a shame in many ways as we would have loved to stay and try some more cocktails! Drinks were the best we've had in Singapore
5
Following dinner nearby during a Singapore visit, we popped into B&L for a late night cocktail, after reading a blogger's rave review of the bespoke cocktails and cozy vibe. Blogger didn't lie! While the door was a bit hard to find (only a small sign above it, nothing showy) we were quickly greeted upon entering and given the only 2 seats left at the bar. Service was unfussy and gracious and bartender Dee was chatty and entertaining as he prepared some of the most unique drinks we'd ever seen. I chose a spirit (gin) and asked for a cocktail that was refreshing and fruity. My husband ordered a craft cocktail from the seasonal menu. Both were delicious and beautiful (mine with fresh raspberries and mint and a chocolate treat balanced on top; his garnished with a smoking stick of cinnamon creating amazing aroma.) The food items others ordered looked delicious, and if only for the spectacle of the prep and presentation, I'd order the kaya toast cocktail next time. Loved the place. Wish we'd had time to visit again

I found this restaurant on Tripadvisor and I decide to go with my husband for dinner during our Honeymoon on SingaporeThis is not a restaurant but more a cocktail bar... The food and the cocktails are fabulous...Best Cocktails ƒ± never drink before!!!!The staff is very friendly.You can't enjoy this place before 6:00pm :-) Magical ambiance with really respect of the quality of everything.All cocktails and fruits are fresh, fresh, fresh...Try the oysters!!! Oh my God! :-)We was there with my husband for our honeymoon.We met the owner Ernesto who came in our table for take us photo. Just after ƒ± say him that we re on Honeymoon he arrives 3 minutes after with 2 glass of champagne :-) Very nice !!! We was so happy with our delicious champagne...We reserve 3 weeks before because this is not a big restaurant bar but a really friendly and peaceful place. Thank you to everybody on Tripadvisor for this recommendation
4
Didn't try the food but spent many hours trying various cocktails.
Best I've had in Singapore, bartender was incredible.
Agree with other reviews that it is hard to find.
5
This place doesnt have dessert but who needs that when you have dessert cocktails! Amazing food and sexy spot for couples. Dress casual or upscale you choose
4
Hidden away behind the restaurant, and you can eat at the bar. Food was really good too, but the highlight is the special cocktails. They have many different types of gin that you normally don't see.
4
When we read about this improvisation style bar we decided to start our evening there. Luckywise we received a tables corner to sit. Friendly staff and worth to try even i still prefer the original Mojito.

great service, we sat at the bar counter and were served by bartender dee. we had a couple of cocktails from classic to bespoke and each drink was spot on to our taste. also better to go on a weekday when they are less busy.
5
Took us walking up and down the street but we finally found the location with unassuming door. It is a sophisticated but relaxed environment combined with excellent service, tasty cocktails, food and good music that is not pretentious like other bars. Highly recommend peeking behind the door of this hidden gem

Used to be the best place in sg. Went last night to the new premises. Still had the smell of glue from the fit out. Service was well below par and more like a double bogey. Have to say that it will be the last time I walk through the door. Expect TripAdvisor rating to drop like a rock

We were recommended this place by a friend who said 'it's hard to find' - and it certainly was! The cab driver didn't have a clue and in the end dropped us off a 5 minute walk away. The door itself is very unassuming and would be easy to walk right past but fortunately we were on the look out! It strikes me that this place isn't somewhere you stumble upon and grab a drink - it's a destination that you heard of by word of mouth and you make the effort to go. And I'm so glad we made the effort! We both had two cocktails (it was our last night and we needed to get up early the next day else we would have stayed all night) and they were both outstanding although weren't necessarily flavours we would have chosen ourselves. They really made me think about how overpowering a lot of other cocktails are - these were delicate and fragrant and quite simply delicious...We also ordered some bar snacks - first the nachos which themselves were pretty standard but the three dips that came with them were incredible and they were soon gone! Then a bit later I went for it and ordered the Wagyu beef cubes - quite pricey for a bar snack but worth every penny. The flavour and texture was absolutely stunning. I wish I had a place like this locally - I'd be broke but extremely happy! A must visit if you are in Singapore - cannot recommend it more :) I will certainly be telling all of my friends about it

We been to many bars in London, Melbourne and Singapore. By far, Bitters & Love has to be one of our favorite bars. Music is good, service is good, drinks are exceptionally good. Try their new big plate dinner, oven grilled sea bass wrapped in banana leaf with homemade chili. delish

I am writing very few reviews, and only after a while. Just to be sure that when I do it, the place worths it. I visited this place more than 2 years ago, and often told myself that i have to write a review...What to say but that it is a Must Do...Amazing cocktail bar, with barman selecting and creating for you special cocktails according to your wishes (just tell him a few things, he will do the rest)Cosy atmosphere : tables, decoration, lights, music... Everything makes you feel relaxed (or romantic ;) )Great people, both customers and from the bar. A special one to the owner, if you manage to meet her...It is colocated with a restaurant (Shoebox Canteen), which explains why it is often listed as a restaurant. Restaurant is ok, but the amazing part is definitely when you enter the second part of this building to enjoy this jewel..

4
Really liked the place, great cocktails, nice bar snacks. Only issue is I looked on Tripadvisor for a restaurant and it was 3rd best in Singapore. Its certainly not a restaurant, its a cocktail bar.
4
This place is definitely a bit more relaxed than the fancy places in the city. Drinks are pricey but worth it. Nice selection of liquor. The staff makes the place and warm and attentive. Cute name too.
5
Such a cool & wonderful place. Incredible cocktails, great and friendly staff. We were very impressed with the incredible array of cocktails, tailored-made to you! Highly recommend it.
4
Their Cocktail and mocktail are awesome. Service is fantastic and the more important is the atmosphere that allow you to relax while enjoying your cool drink after a busy day.
4
Interesting place to destress and unwind, especially on Friday evenings. Maybe the entrance is under renovation, but we do thought so from its wooden construction walls and padlock door at the front. Nevertheless, make your way in and be treated for a nice surprise. One of the best cocktails places, and with pizzas/ appetisers to top it off. Slightly pricey
5
Amazing cocktail bar with the most ingenious cocktail barmen especially the one who served us called Dee. If you go for the 'surprise me' option based on some of your preferences that surprise will be guaranteed. Great place to start your evening if you can find your way in through the door. It certainly made a great start to ours.

Visited bitters and love twice during my stay in singapore. It has an unassuming entrance marked only by a small sign on a white door. Don't worry if it looks closed, just push on the door and the bar will reveal itself. At about 6pm on Thursday we had the place to ourselves and the undivided attention of the bartender. They make custom cocktails based on the spirit and overall flavour that tickles your fancy. The element of surprise really adds to the experience. The second visit, which was on a saturday night, was somewhat more chaotic with staff obviously under pressure. The drink I ordered was less enjoyable and the overall experience felt less personalised. The playlist could only be described as bizzare with everything ranging from "wonder wall" to miley cyrus. Such a shame as they have achieved such an alternative and edgy feel from the exterior and concept. Music ruined it a little for us. I would say to achieve the best experience at this place go in a small group or couple and get a seat at the bar so you can enjoy watching your drinks being made
5
We popped in for a few drinks and snacks after looking for good places in Singapore and this place was brilliant. Starting with the nonchalant hidden not so hidden entrance to add intrigue and mystery and inside is such a cool calm laid back vibe great for a great drink with friends or a get together. We tried a few cocktails and all were so well made, explained and presented. The guys were super friendly and went through different styles to see what we like and all hit the spot with the standout being a Mt Gay Chilli request with South East Asian tastes and presentation. We also had some snacks trying the beef cubes and truffle chips and they were also really tasty and a nice compliment to the drinks. All in all definatley a cool place to hang out
4
Artfully prepared drinks, a very small nook of a bar, but a treasure none the less. I got the Kaya toast drink and it comes with a piece of kaya toast on top - it was very tasty. I'd say it was all a bit expensive for a small bar but that is normal for Singapore. My friends and I had fun at the low bar evesdropping on people's conversations for the evening
4
Bitters & Love is a great place for cocktails and drinks in the downtown area. Although prices are a bit high, the cool bartenders and the vibe make this bar worth a visit.
4
How i wonder they are in number 1 spot here in Tripadvisor, service is good, food was amazing, over all experience is fantastic..love to be back here,
5
Went to this fab bar april 2014, and can say the owner ernest went out of his way to make the cocktails and, drink sampling one of the best i have ever had.
5
Love the whole concept of Bitters & Love. Though I got a bit disappointed when showing it to a friend who said everything is a complete rip off of Palmer & Co in Sydney... Still nice cocktails though, and super friendly/service minded staff.
3
Was there with few friends for drinks since we heard that its a fantastic cocktail bar. Interesting cocktails that they serve. Service was prompt. But it was a bit too expensive when you compare the price with what you get.
5
The cocktails here are 2nd to none! You tell them what spirit you like and they create a masterpiece for you.The service is sensational as soon as she knew it was our first visit the hostess sat with us and explain how it all works, the food options and suggested some drinks for us to start on
5
What a welcome we got from Fiona and Ernest to this excellent venue-- and it wasn't even open! But once they heard it was our last night they were determined not to disappoint and 2 unique delicious cocktails were prepared for us whilst they enthused and explained some history of the company and their industry. Bitters and Love - very sweet and a lot of Love-- not to be missed
4
I was there in Feb 2015 with some of my cousins for a few post-dinner drinks. It was a weekday & the place was bustling with the after-work crowd. The visually attractive drinks although yummy, were a little pricey. We each had about 4 drinks. I like a good drink but you can't drink much at that cost. Not sure if I would go anytime soon. But will recommend if you are within the vicinity
5
Convenient to CBD and the river area, Bitters and Love has talented mixologists who can surprise and maybe amaze with the innovative cocktails. If you can describe a flavour, they can evoke it or nail it. The food items are on a compact menu, but are very good. A great place for a relaxing evenin
5
This place is top notch! Highly recommended, and I will go back every single time I'm in Singapore. The drinks / mixologists are on par with some of the best mixologists in the world. It reminded me very much of The Aviary in Chicago, and some of their cocktails may have surpassed it!I had the sea bass wrapped in banana leaf for dinner, and it was mind blowing. I want to go back and eat 10 more! I can't say one bad thing. Servers were spot on and offered great recommendations. Go here, trust me. Secure a reservation for a great spot. If you don't like this place, I'll give you your money back.
5
We had some of the best cocktails we have ever had here! It is a cute bar hidden away off the street. The cocktails are so delicious and they can pretty much make whatever you want. The staff are also friendly!
5
It's a small cocktail bar located in between the shophouses facing Hong Lim Park. Nice to chill out and have a cocktail, or two. MUST TRY, their beef cubes, it's to die for.
4
It is a good hangout bar! The bar food is sinful but delicious. Cocktail is average at best but many bars in Singapore lack people with the know-how so not surprising.
Will come back if I am close by!
3
Nice drinks. Very unique taste for cocktails. Cost slightly on the high side. Good for a drink but for the thirsty type. Go somewhere else
5
The restaurant \ bar has great amtosferu. the food is amazing and nice served. Very friendly staff and quality of service.
4
Butters & Love made me fall deeply in love with creative cocktails...their Kaya toast cocktail is my all time favorite. They are moving to Telok Ayer soon after 6 May, c'mon over to visit this lovely mystical bar with plants hanging from the ceiling. Talented bartenders and lovely staff, nice music and ambience
5
Personal and website recommendations motivated us to seek out Bitters & Love. Love it, we did, visiting the original location before they move to their new premises in May. With a gorgeous small bar vibe, Fiona talked to us about our flavor preferences and we watched the bartender create two very delicious unique cocktails that were a big hit! Will return
5
Warm ambience, creative drinks presentation, perfect drinks, friendly service and tasty snacks. This place is located in a hidden area at the province on Clark Quay. Which means, if you're looking for Bitters and love, you'll probably have to find a restaurant called Shoebox Canteen just opposite the Hong Lim Park. It is placed just inside the restaurant. (I had some trouble looking for this place but with the help of their staff over the line, it was easy!)I've gotta say that the staff were all attentive. D, was really helpful in allowing us to collaborate some useful informations about the place. Their basic nature of service is pretty much tip-top. Which means every one of them seems to be well trained for the effortless services. They knows their menu really well, which allows us to trust them with our chosen drinks/food.I am pretty amazed with the creativity of the drinks presentation. Will definitely be back for more exciting drinks!Good job, keep it up!

Went here for cocktails. Staff was very friendly and laid back when it came to explaining how the customized cocktail menu works. Loved the fact that they have a creative approach in making cocktails. Cocktails were nice but not out of this world great. At least not for sgd20-25. Now I know Singapore is just expensive when it comes to alcoholic drinks, but when you only have one type of red wine and one type of white wine on your menu, sgd15 is just a bit too much. The service was great, but I did feel rushed. All in all it was okay
4
Their drinks menu is very creative, allowing fully customized order and sheer surprise when your drink is served. Beware though, bartenders don't joke around with the words "strong cocktail". I went ahead and ordered: "anything with grapefruit" and it was damn delicious (think it was run + cointreau + grapefruit + grape juice). My friend had "Surprise me with gin" and was very happy as well. The bar was not crowded when we arrived at 10PM, however the music was too loud and not really complimenting the bar atmosphere
5
I love these little places that are "in the know", this one has great drinks and great music, get there early or book to get a seat!!
5
My husband and i went here on Year New Eve and we had the best time and ended up staying until they closed. The staff were super friendly, the cocktails were fantastic. We will be back next time we are Singapore.
5
This place offers one of the best selections of spirits I have encountered in Singapore so far. You don't simply choose a cocktail of a menu but pick your spirit and let them know what taste direction you prefer to go with it (or let them surprise you). Based on this the skilled bar keepers will create a drink that does not only look like a sculpture fresh out of a modern art gallery but also tastes very refined and well composed. Get a seat at the bar if you want to watch the action. The service is great, prices are Singapore-like (around S$25 per drink) and the crowd is mixed. It's a bit difficult to find as there is no sign outside but you won't regret looking for it. Will come back
5
i love the taste, creativity, passion, and the quality of the drinks! you cant find it anywhere here in singapore. fun and friendly bartenders! amazing! i was just disappointed with their truffle potatoes it was serve cold, salty at the same time i didnt taste any truffle but after we informed they added truffle oil but still not up to my expectation
5
Been there with my fianc√É¬© on Valentine's Day . This place is absolutely stunning with lively bartenders making fantastic cocktails ! The ingredients which they are using in the cocktails are very distinctive . Surprise me cocktails were very unique and the presentation was fabulous ! We both enjoyed the whole experience ! Will definitely recommend to anyone who wants to have awesome cocktail experience !
5
My husband and I had a fantastic night here on our second last night in Singapore! You could easily walk by the bar but it's situated behind the canteen box. We both had two custom made cocktails. My husband had a fruity cocktail served up in a bag used for takeout coffee. His second was an old fashioned with a delicious dark rum. I had a surprise with mine, I asked for spicy and got a real kick. It was a gin based cocktail served in a teapot with ginger and chilli. It was a grower! The second was served in a tea cup and was a fruity refreshing gin cocktail. Delish!We stayed until closing because the tunes were awesome! Lots of backstreet boys and power ballads!!!Thanks to all the staff for a brilliant night!
5
I usually trust TripAdvisor if the crowd of reviewers is international and travelled. This recommendation was absolutely perfect.Bespoken cocktails is my new favoured word. My "tailor" created 2 funtastic experiences with Gin / Wodka just from my description. It was an amazing surprise where he took me with not only perfect taste but cool design.Interior charming, chaotic, comfortable. Get a seat at the bar. Good show and fun to see.Music was too loud for flirt. Almost lost my voice. If you have little to talk thats no problem.I will be back. Next trip to Singapore. Guaranteed 
5
This place is a must for drinks and cocktails.My partner invented his own and I had a house special.We also had their house wine which was good. The staff are friendly and entertaining, we were given some special plum liqueur.Yum! But be quick as they are moving soon 
4
We headed to the bar first & ordered a couple of cocktails and nachos for starters. We went for the Kai toast which was interestingly fabulous and a laphroig10-Old fashioned. The nice lady in the front found us seating in the restaurant as there was a late booking for a table. We had the chicken special & a burger- both were great except for the black burger bun which was weird & seemed rather stale on the bottom. We moved to the bar and had another cocktail or 2- all enjoyable & we will be back.
5
My partner and I were recommended that when in Singapore we need to have a cocktail at 'Bitters and Love' and they were absolutely correct! This bar has a fabulous atmosphere and endless creations of cocktails that the bartenders can come up, the presentation of each cocktail is outstanding and very creative, If you don't know what you feel like you advise the bartender your favorite spirit and want it sweet, fruity etc and they creative this amazing cocktail just for you!This place is certainly a must whenever you're in Singapore, thanks to Bev and her fabulous staff I'll definitely be back
5
Without a doubt, the best cocktails I have ever tasted!!! Choose your base spirit and the creative geniuses will custom make a cocktail - just choose, spicy, sour, fruity etc... Presentation - out of this world. Cool vibe. Awesome urban interior. Love it!
5
One of the best cocktail bars that I've visited. These guys really know what they're doing and are happy to create something unique for you based on what you like. Great setting too.
4
I heard about this place through Tripadvisor. It's not that hard to find if you keep an eye out. It's about a 5 min walk from Clark Quay MRT. We came for pre-dinner cocktails - we were eating at the Shoebox which is the front of this bar. We were the only ones in the bar and there were 2 bartenders and 1 student behind the bar. I asked for a "try me" gin cocktail and got an okay fruity cocktail. It tasted like any cocktail one could get from a restaurant or hotel. We then ordered from their house cocktail list (the banana cocktail was not available that night). The kaya toast cocktail was delicious (if you enjoy kaya) with the added bonus of kaya toast on top. My partner got the gunpowder cocktail which was quite the production event and beautifully presented, although a lot of volume gets burned off! I saw lovely rose decorated, fruit decorated cocktails going to other tables so tried once more with a "try me" peach liquor cocktail and again was disappointed by a generic cocktail. The good news is that although you can't eat in the bar, you can have cocktails ordered into the restaurant. We will definitely return to try more house cocktails - maybe others in the TA world have suggestions of what to ask for? We certainly didn't get any of the weird and inventive cocktails mentioned: toasted marshmallow, carved fruit etc. Drinks are expensive compared to Canada/US but fairly typical for Singaporean cocktails
5
thought of give it a try after seeing all the good reviews & rank no.2 here.went there for a pre-dinner drink. indeed it is hard to find as it is hidden behind Shoebox Canteen with nothing but a mailbox in front saying "Bitter and Love"menu was explained by the lovely waitress and we ordered Nikka Black Whiskey & Tequila Cadeza with "surprise me" just to feel a little adventurous.mine came in a small metal pot with caramelized pineapple cubes and curry leaves, turned out there are lime, Chinese 5 spices & some other ingredients in my cocktail. weird combination especially with the curry leaves but they matched perfectly!my girlfriend's is a mix of passion fruit, mints, lime and some other fruit juices garnished with half of passionfruit, mint & lime leaves...sour with a kick is all i can say!whole place is small but cozy..highly recommended as the bartenders are skillful & staff are friendly!the price might be a little high but with all the above mentioned positive points, worth it
5
Had my birthday drinks here with about 30 friends. I did not expect so many people to turn up and did not anticipate the need for a table quite that large. However, they were extremely accommodating and did everything they could to ensure that all my guests had a seat and were comfortable. The drinks are also amazing, with a wide variety of different cocktails. My all-time favourite is the kaya cocktail
5
We got the waitress to suggest a cocktail for us after I told her I wanted something sour and not too alcoholic. The bartender came up with a really delicious cocktail that not only tasted but also looked great. Music is fab but I hear the genre varies each day. Great atmosphere too with a view of the bartender showing off his skills at the counter
5
Staff were extremely knowledgable on the liqours and provided great suggestives based on your preferences. There were customisable cocktails but we tried the wide wide selection of gin instead. Drinks were prepared with such care and they were fantastic. Do not miss the beef cubes they were the most delicious ive had. Loved the concept and decor and music selection - 90s hits that all 30-somethings know. A little pricier than standard chain bars but service and quality justified it. Will visit again
5
Every city has its insider tips. Places where lumbersexuals mix drinks behind the bar, while being adored by little hipster girls. Although, the location of Bitters & Love is no secret, you easily can be rattled while searching for the entrance. The bar is located right behind the Shoe Box Canteen. A small (by the way also highly recommended) restaurant. Since the windows are slightly darkened and the sign rather suggests a cheap shoe store, you quite often see people with big question marks on their foreheads, nervously walking up and down the road.So do not worry. Put on your perky smile and walk in to Shoe Box Canteen, waving and heading right towards the bar. At Bitters & Love, delicious cocktail variations will be waiting for you. Quite often ‚Äústartenders‚Äù (hyped bartenders) will be visiting from abroad
4
The bar is pretty small and it doesnt have the view either. If you are looking for a place with stunning night views? Go somewhere else.If you look for some nice cocktail place, small but cozy, and plus that has good quality of cocktail, you got the right place. :)You can choose the base liquor and flavor you like. I feel like being lazy to choose what to order, I called "surprise me" four times. LolThey looked beautiful and tasted amazing. They also provide pretty tasty bar menu.
5
We love our cocktails so naturally we are in search of the best cocktail bar. There are many good bars in Singapore but after visiting bitters & love, these could possible be the best thus far! We came on a Tuesday and the bar was 90% full so service was quick, attentive and we got our drinks relatively fast. I love gin so we tried from martinis to negronis. Interesting selection of whisky too. We will be back for sure
4
came across this place by chance. Great thing here is you can mix your own cocktail. Service staffs are friendly, ambiance is cozy so worth the price you pay here.
4
Fancy place with stylish people. But the greatest attraction is to create your own cocktails.
But also standard drinks and food is very nice
3
It is ok but I do not feel it should be at that ranking. Place is a little too dim and cocktail the bartender choose to prepare does not impressed me. The place is a little too crampy for us to be comfortable.
5
The bar is same place as the Shoeshine Canteen, on the other side of Parkrooyal Hotel. A bit noisy. They service a limited choice of decent food (the burger was very good)
5
Was a little difficult to find this place on a Saturday evening, you would walk right past it and wouldn't know. But when you do find it, the reward is totally worthwhile! Good quality ingredients, the Ancient Orchard packs a punch and tastes wonderful.
5
This place is listed as a restaurant but we have only always had cocktails here which is also the reason to go here. I pretty much consider this the best cocktail bar in town. The way it works is you pick a liquor/brand from a list and then tell the staff how you would like to have your cocktail: not too sweet, or fruity, or perhaps smoky-flavored. And then the staff will serve you with a concoction made to perfection. Never fails. It's a concept which with the popularity of speak-easy's everywhere in Asia has become increasingly more popular. This is perhaps also a bit of a pitfall in the long run: the novelty might wear out at some point and you will find yourself longing for a Long Island Ice Tea which is something this bar doesn't do. Until then we will be coming back a couple of times more
4
Easy to walk past. It is in the back room of the Shoebox Canteen. The bartenders put a lot of thought and work into the drinks. They also are presented well. Lots of flare as a cocktail bar tends to have. The quality and variety of ingredients is impressive. Drinks run about S$25 each, so a bit pricey, but all drinks in Singapore are.My first drink was the Driftwood. A whiskey based drink with a bottle of hickory smoke to waft just prior to each sip. This was a drink worth the cost just to experience. My second was a Moscow Mule, which I was disappointed with. I have had much better at many different places. I was expecting a unique twist on the drink or at least a perfect one, but the bite of the ginger was completely missing. My third was a gin based drink with cucumber and what I think was lemongrass. It was quite refreshing and was made with care and attention to detail in presentation. This is a fun place to go for a nice cocktail and it a nice change from the nearby bars at Clarke's Quay, but the drinks seem to be hit or miss. I was also a little disappointed that there was not more of a drink menu available. Their menu listed about 7 drinks. I can't ever remember the names of cocktails that I like, so a menu and description of house specialty drinks would be nice. For all of their equipment and ingredients they must have more than 7 drinks
5
We had read reviews about this location so decided to check it out. We did walk straight past due to no signage, you really have to know about the place which is part of its charm. For no signage its a really busy place so I guess no signage works. This place is great for small groups of four or 5 or couples. The way they set the menu is great, a price for a shot a price for a cocktail or price for a bottle. Our cocktails about $21-$25.00 which is great for Singapore.The barmen take their time to prepare your cocktail with little touches of sculptured fruits and herbs making your drinks interesting to look at and taste.Top little place inside the Shoebox canteen - well worth the search

I'd had visiting Bitters & Love on my 'To Do' list from the day we decided on Singapore as part of our holiday and I am so pleased we made it there! I have to say our visits to this awesome bar have given us so many awesome memories of our Singapore stay and made us fall in love with Singapore and the friendly hospitality even more. So for our experience ‚Ä¶Our first visit (yep it was so amazing we had to go back!) we went on a friday evening and arrived around 7:30pm. We sat at a table near the end of the bar as all the seats at the bar were taken. Our first two cocktails arrived and we were both so impressed. I went the Maya Toast and it was seriously delicious! We have nothing like it in Australia so was quite the experience. My husband had a hot cocktail paired with raisins which was also very impressive. Halfway through the first cocktail we were asked if we wanted to move to seats as some at the bar had come available. We both love sitting right at the bar wherever we go so made the move - and it was the absolute best decision! We spent the following 4 hours watching the Bitters & Love teams incredible talent as they whipped up some seriously amazing cocktails. We were lucky enough to have Naz making our drinks and he is the cocktail master!! We enjoyed 7 cocktails each (yep we just couldn't leave!) and every single one was amazingly delicious and a true experience. The flavours were all so well balanced and thanks to the fresh ingredients used there was no nasty headache the next morning. We were visiting on the night of our 5th wedding anniversary so we even got a special complimentary cocktail with a celebratory candle - such a lovely personal touch. We finally pulled ourselves away and promised to return when we returned to Singapore from a quick few days of RnR in Thailand.5 nights later, the night before flying home to Australia we headed back. We arrived early this time because we just couldn't wait to be downing some delicious cocktail goodness ‚Ä¶ We secured the same two seats at the bar (thanks to being some of the first customers) and decided to this time order some food as well. We got the truffle hand cut fries and the chicken nibbles. MmMmMm I must say that was some seriously good chicken!! The fries were pretty delicious too.Then to the cocktails ‚Ä¶. well again we enjoyed amazing cocktail after amazing cocktail - we really couldn't fault them.During our two visits we had had a chance to get to know all the staff and have a chat with them all. They are all such friendly, happy and helpful people and I have to say that the welcoming atmosphere coupled with the amazing cocktail mixing skills really is what has put this place at number 1.We were enjoying our final cocktail of the night and next thing we get handed a bag with gifts inside and a lovely note from the team - I mean could this place get any better?! This place has the perfect balance of friendly staff who genuinely love what they do and do it with passion which makes for a great atmosphere to relax and enjoy the amazing cocktails that the talented mixologists whip up.We just can not wait to go back! Thank you to Fiona, Naz, Beverly & the team for keeping it real and showing that friendly hospitality and loving what you do is still possible

But do not be in a rush! The experience is in watching as they carefully prepare your drinks. I just asked the bartender to prepare me a drink w/vodka. He worked diligently for at least 15 minutes and handed me a ball jar wrapped in a paper bag with a cracked egg shell hanging off the side (that had a fire lit inside it) and a marshmallow on a skewer. He informed me it was made w/passion fruit, vodka and infused rosemary. The marshmallow was to be roasted over the "egg" mini fire pit. Was hysterical and delicious. The bar is small and dimly lit. Very cozy! Hard to find though......you will be looking for a sign that says SHOEBOX CANTEEN. The bar is in the back of this restaurant.
4
A place for couples rather than groups. Location is a bit difficult to find, but still is worth the visit.The almost hidden location leads to an awesome space with good drinks & music. The bartenders are knowledgeable. Definitely a place to recommend to others.
4
This spot serves some of the city's most inventive cocktails. The interiors are stylishly hip and there was a nice crowd for a Wednesday. For tapas, I particularly liked the truffle potatoes.
4
Had the pleasure, of being at one of Bitters & Love pop-up events; by far, some of the best presented and tasting cocktails around. Loved their packaging, quirky branding and innovation in cocktail recipes.
5
I went there for a couple of cocktails before dinner.I was impressed by their collection liquors. had their famous kaya toast cocktail; was a bit sweet but very unique.Whiskey sour was a bit sweet as well but was still good.i think it's an ideal place for a couple rather than a group of friends
5
The cocktail menu has flavour types and not traditional cocktails. So if you like sweet, smokey and whisky - they create a bespoke cocktail to suit your palate.This place is understandable at the top of the list of drinks places to go in Singapore. Food is reasonable price and whilst it is a small menu - your there really for the drinks
5
Although it may be difficult to find, Bitters & Love is well worth a visit. The almost hidden location leads to an awesome space with good drinks & music. The bartenders are knowledgeable and able to whip out a drink according to our preference. The cocktails were well balanced and had creative garnishing. Service was excellent of course and shout out to Fiona for making our experience so different. It was crowded during our visit on a Thursday night however we were lucky to have a comfortable place to sit
4
I had the Kata Toast cocktail and it is up there with the best cocktails I have ever had...Thought the prices were on the high side... Bar food was good but nothing special...2 cocktails, 2 mock tails, bar food for 3 ....cost us around √Ç¬£70Would go back for that cocktai
5
If you're looking for a place to have a beer or a Gin&tonic then this is not what you're looking for. But if you're willing to try something completely different then this is your place. The bartenders can make a drink of everything and it seems to always taste great even though you pick the weirdest combination of ingredients. The price level is also very good, considering they're making everything from scratch. You'll have all sorts of flaming, roasting, smoking going on and they make sure it always becomes a perfect mix of tastes. A great place to being friends for a night out (they play great music too except for the occasional backstreet boys tune).
4
This bar is a must go to place in Singapore. Everything from the ambiance to the imagination and passion that go into the making of the drinks.. been here a couple of times. Service can be a tad slow and they dont really have a lot of starters in case you get hungry. We once ordered a plate of truffle fries and they forgot the order!! they make an amazing seared passion fruit martini ..

We went to B&L last nite after reading the glowing reviews on Trip Advisor. We can only say that bar none, this was the best bar we have ever been to. Small, eclectic ambience, but by far the best staff & drink concoctions we have ever experienced! No drink 'names', you just tell them what you like & they literally created a drink for you. The artistry of not only the drinks, but the creative presentation was truly amazing. Can't wait to go back again. Definitely sit at the bar for the true experience.The bar food was satisfactory (get the beef cubes), but you really go there for the drinks!Cannot say enough good things about this 'diamond in the rough'! Enjoy

Had my first virgin Singapore Sling and I loved it! The atmosphere and location are what makes it a must.
5
Have been there twice.
Staff has a great knowledge and drinks are unique
Definitely worth the visit. Little bit hidden in/behind the shoebox canteen.

The choise of spirits and drinks is really amazing... you can find many brands from all over the world. The owner chooses very carefully any spirit so you can find for example gins from England, Germany, France, US and vodka made from potatoes or milk!!You can choose your cocktail from the menu, ask for a special one or just indulge asking for a "surprise me".. and something unforgettable will change your evening forever... Pay attention.. it's addictive..We went there all the nights of our stay in Singapore..Ernst, the owner, makes the place even more special with all his suggestion and advice....He let us taste also his creations.... Japanese plums "ume" with spirits.. Great!!!I had also some snacks... the Wagyu meat was very good and also the dessert was very creamy
5
Came here with my wife after reading the excellent reviews on TA and we have not been disappointed!Prices for cocktails are north of $20, not quite cheap, but which bar in Singapore offers (good) cheap cocktails?You can either ask the bartender to make a cocktail based on your tastes (i.e. you tell him which spirit you like, if you prefer it strong or fruity, etc. and he does a tailor-made drink for you), or choose from one of the few signature cocktails they offer. I went for the second option and choose the Kaya cocktail... It is served in a transparent mug with 2 slices of toasted bread with kaya jam. Simply amazing!!! A must try if you love fruity drinks.Service is great as well. Staff is very knowledgable and kind.At the end of the month I will be back in Singapore and I will go there again for sure
5
The atmosphere was great. Lounge feel with great playlists. I was solo and the owner (I didn't know at the time) came and talked to me for the entire visit. Great concept - drinks are made from fresh ingredients, based on what your taste buds desire. To access it, you have to walk through the restaurant Shoebox Canteen.
5
A few days ago went out with some friends, by 11.30 pm we all had a sweet tooth and decided to visit this restaurant which is opposite I12 mall. They really have some good stuff I loved the brownie and ice-cream with a long black. Will sure come back for a sit down some time
5
Drinking cocktails in Singapore can be a very painful experience given the local price levels. But the money is very well spent at Bitters & Love. The bar doesn't have a menu but the bartender creates an indivual cocktail for you based on your wishes. Of course you can also order your favourites if you are not up for the surprise. The atmosphere is cosy and relaxed and the service is great
5
so we have been exploring the cocktail bar scenes in singapore. our concierge at park royal pickering told us about a little restaurant across hong lim park at north canal. great food there you can read about the reviews at shoebox canteen. we peered through the door and saw a bar hidden behind frosted doors. it was a quirky yet rustic atmosphere with friendly staff who always preempted our needs for a refill without being intrusive. look out for their kaya toast cocktail, using a local jam made from pandan and coconut
5
This is our second visit and each time it surpassed our expectation! We were greeted by smiling service staff who seated us at the bar counter (that is where all the action is anyway). The bartender recommended their latest - apple pie cocktail was delicious with their homemade fillings and a nice balance of bourbon. Food wise, their signature wagyu beef cubes and triple cooked handcut chips were really good too
5
Found this bar on trip advisor and decided to try it out with friends on our second night in Singapore, given the great reviews. It surpassed my expectations completely. The cocktails were amazing! We had two each. For our first cocktail we told our host what we liked, e.g. I wanted white rum with a sweet and fruity flavour - it was delicious. For our second cocktail we chose to have a surprise, and we were not disappointed.Food was extremely tasty however the menu was somewhat limited. Quality over quantity though as we all thoroughly enjoyed what we ordered! Portion sizes were perfect.We had a great Australian host who was so welcoming and helpful to our group. She gave us lots of helpful hints and tips for our holiday in Singapore. Would definitely recommend this bar for great cocktails and food in a cool atmosphere
5
A wonderful experience all round. Delicious cocktails (ask for one with Nutella. Best cocktail I've ever had), fantastic food and wonderful staff. We were able to sit at the bar which was comfortable and very interesting to watch the bartenders do their thing.
Loved it!
5
This was the second time I went there. Both were amazing experiences!
The decoration, the music, the friendly service and most of all the surprising containers they use to serve the different, imaginative and tasty drinks. Definitely worthwhile the visit!
5
Quite frankly the best cocktail bar in Singapore. Ambience is fantastic, and the cocktails are second to none. A must.

I specifically chose a Monday night to visit this niche establishment as I figured it would be packed on a Friday night. Well, I was right.We literally walked past the 'Shoebox Canteen' while trying to find a "Bitters & Love" shopfront without realizing that this is it! Puzzling that we were told that the dinner section is not open and only the drinks section was. Isn't it dinner time around 730pm? Good thing that we already had our dinner at BK eating house, otherwise we would be disappointed.Since it was a Monday night, there were plenty of cosy couch seats. The caucasian waitress was patient and introduced to us a few of their signatures. Truth be told, I only visited this place as I was dying to try their Kaya Toast Cocktail after having heard so many great things about it. Still, I listened patiently as she had a very good attitude about her.Verdict:- Kaya Toast Cocktail: Presentation scored a 10 for me. The drink came in a lid-less medium-sized transparent mug with a bespoke label of the drink and to top it off (literally) - a triangle-sized kaya toast with a dainty dollop of kaya. The drink itself is refreshing with a surprisingly sweet aftertaste of kaya. Never knew kaya could go so well in a drink! Would love to have one of these on a hot day!- Love chips: Basically, it's truffled fried baked potatoes neatly cut into bite-sized pieces - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside - and doused with sea salt.The vibe of the place makes one feel very relax though the music was a tad too loud for me. When I say loud, I mean really loud-like-I-can't-hear-you loud though I love the acoustic pop song CD they were playing that day.Would definitely come back again...but not on a Friday night
5
My hubby and I just recently moved to Singapore from Sydney and decided to pop by on a lazy Monday night after hearing so many friends in Australia rave about this place. It definitely lived up to our expectations. The cocktails were truly inventive and exciting to drink (not to mention crazy delicious!!!). The service was genuine and friendly. We had a great night and can't wait to come back really soon :
5
Great little hidden cocktail bar. Found via trip advisor and we are happy to say although highly rated it is still very private and not overcrowded. Great place, amazing concept and great cocktail creations. Choose your favourite sprit then choose sweet, fruity, bitter, floral or spicy or surprise me and they will make a cocktail with your ideas in mind. Every cocktail tasted fab! Would recommend to all to go try one night.
4
Great bar and concept that the boat quay area really needed. Staff are friendly and all definitely cool kids. Only disappointment is that we wanted to order food from the restaurant menu but were told this was not possible. It made no sense as the bar was almost empty and we would have spent at least a few hundred dollars more on food by we're denied the opportunity because it was intended to be different styles. I'd suggest t relax a rule like that if people want to pay you money!All in all though a great place and well worth a pimped up g&t
5
This place is fantastic and so much fun! It is a hidden little spot with a very cool interior and super friendly and helpful staff. We were lucky enough to meet the owner who was so kind and lovely. The snacks were absolutely delicious and the cocktails were incredible. You can order signature cocktails or try the mixology! Choose your alcohol then tell the server how you like your drink i.e. sweet, sour, fruity, bitter etc. They'll make you a personalised cocktail and serve it to you in a very funky glass, jug or something else breathtaking. This was one of the best bar experiences I've ever had. it's a classy but fun place with great music, a great atmosphere, excellent service and most importantly, BRILLIANT cocktails. I will definitely be going back! For more travel reviews, stories and tips from around the world check out: www.littlegreybox.ne

The bar was busy when we got there around 12am. Atmosphere was cozy and inviting. Beyond the entrance stretches a long open bar where you'll see 4-5 bartenders concocting their mixes away, with their mixing tools and gadgets on laying across the entire bar along with the bottles. Quite a comfortable sight, makes a typical bar less sterile with all the visible works going on. The only shame is the kitchen was no longer opened at that hour, otherwise some nibbles would have been perfect. The drinks menu is extensive and it is possible that you might end up trying few different cocktails in a night. Will return for sure
3
Went with a friend for a couple of drinks and found the place decent enough. Not as entertaining as another hidden bar 1 street away but funky nonetheless.The drinks were good but these prices for cocktails are too much which seems to eb a common theme in these quirky hidden bars. Just paying for the privilege to sit in the back room of a restaurant.Still would recommend at least one visit there
5
Awesome experience and the cocktail bar is amazing!! Not easy to find but worth the search. While having dinner, the cocktails kept coming! Very exciting selection of Bitters, Gin, Whiskey....all with a little twist!!
5
Visited with a few friends and was seated comfortbly. Nobody rushes you to leave even when cocktails were finished.
Had a customized cocktail with bubbly and it was delicious! Must try the kaya toast cocktail it's really cute.
4
Friday night in B & L with the missus and friends...given a table without booking though the place seemed busy, very helpful staff, great selection of drinks , decent finger food (we had the vege options), skillful mixologists pouring some mean cocktails and a great atmosphere ( barring some of the music which was a tad too loud ....20 yr olds would have probably liked it though !)...would recommend the hot drink...Moroccan spices and cinnamon .... Will go back again
3
Cosy venue, good sofa seating with decent bar food. The mixologist can stir up anything you want or any flavors you preferred. We had him prepared 5 of his personal special and 1 was good. The rest though creative and fancifully decorated, nothing much to rave about.  Will definitely visit again but probably sticking to the more common cocktails
5
Pros:+ Ambiance: relaxed atmosphere, nice to sit at the bar+ Custom cocktails: freshly prepared. Had a great strong + cacao cocktail+ Show: some of the cocktails were prepared with fire or smokeCons:- Prices: Singapore prices :) of about 25 per cocktail- Location: hard to find: it's behind a small restaurant with a different name (sorry, don't know the name anymore, but Google maps location is correct and accurate
5
Direction: key in 36 north canal road on google. Shoebox canteen one part. Walk straight in is Bitter & love.Bitter & Love only serve nibbles. No a la carte. Ala carte have to dine in at Shoebox. Then back in here for drinks.We have visited twice this week. Monday had kaya toast cocktail as the best seller here while had burger and steak at shoebox. Fantastic!Thursday come again with local friends who has never been before. Had mangosteen cocktail (seasonal). Not on the menu. Accompanied with threesome sliders (mini burgers), Wagyu beef (a bit fat) and salami pizza (thin crust) just like we like.It is top notch service here. Know what they are selling at the bars. Pick your fruits, they recommend the cocktails. One of the bartender birthday today, we got offered a free whisky shot for toast. ;-) happy face. Will come back again try the gun powder tea. They don't have some of the ingredients today.Keep up the standard and good work. Let all the TA users know top 10 restaurant in Singapore shouldn't be a 5 star hotel restaurant. No personality. Purely foreigner workers and chef

As part of our bar hopping adventure one Friday night, we walked into Bitters & Love after a session at another club directly in the next street behind it.Less discreet than the bar we went before (whose name I shall not mention, though I did review it), Bitters & Love was all charming, candid and I dare say, real.The mixologists manning the bar were most extraordinary. Encapsulating the adventurous spirit, anything goes really.I ordered the Kaya Toast. No, not the ubiquitous local breakfast, but the drink. Yes, you heard right. Well blended with Mount Gay Rum, peach liqueur, kaya jam, English Breakfast tea, honey, fresh lemon juice, syrup, and egg white, replete with a slice of kaya toast (but of course) it sounded nasty. But oddly enough, it's actually not bad and grows on you and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I hear there's a Bak Kut Teh cocktail. Think I'll save that for another day.When you are there, do order some food. I had the wagyu ribeye cubes pan seared with sea salt flakes and some jamon baguette. And they were both delicious! Pretty sure it wasn't the cocktail talking....I think. But seriously, the food is indeed good.Will definitely return for more. Keep up the great work, chaps, and continue to be adventurous and original. Well done

If you dare to experiment your drink and are able to articulate what you want, then you won't be disappointed here. Been to Nektar and Bar Stories but this place is a notch above the rest for the unique and award winning cocktails. Let it be a spicy Moroccan Smoking Gun Powder tea (where each sip has to be followed by a raisin) or the unusual Kaya toast (yes you read it right), these drinks are a pleasure to experience. Bitter, spicy, sweet, fruity or salty, you name it, they experiment it here. Service is good and ask for Fiona as she is best at understanding what flavour you want and convey the same to the bartender. The thing they can improve on are the bar bites spread. Didn't have many options while we visited there. It didn't matter to us much as we were heading for dinner elsewhere
5
We followed the TripAdvisor's review and decided to try out tonight. It was absolutely fantastic for the food, the cocktails, the service and the ambience. The price was reasonable. We had smoked duck pasta and pan seared salmon for dinner. They were great. Cocktails we had were Kaya Toast, Botanist and Nikka Coffey. The cocktails were very well presented and they taste wonderfully great. It is indeed the #1 ranked restaurant by TripAdvisor
5
A little hard to find at first, there is an eating area in the front part and the cocktail bar at the back. It is quite the experience! Firstly, these are upmarket cocktails so not your average G&T. The staff are very attentive during the selection process,a little overly so for one of our party. However they know their drinks and offer some unique drink options. One of us opted for the 'surprise' option to add to a vodka based cocktail and it resulted in a glorious concoction involving a tiki mug, passion fruit and a smoking cinnamon stick... Cocktails are handmade and delivered in sequence so this can lead to a lag between the first and last arriving. It was a slow Monday night when we were there, maybe the process is more refined at busy times. In any event a pleasurable, relaxed addition to our evening ou
5
Absolutely delicious cocktails! Try the Newton! Food very healthy and delicious! Next time in Singapore I will be here again!
5
Hands down my favorite cocktail bar with perennial favorites, seasonal specialties and bespoke cocktails made to order. To top it off, their friendly staff, chill out ambience and yummy bar snacks will keep you coming back again and again!
5
Everything is perfect from service to the food and drink. The service was great especially the owner Andrew. Definitely recommend to friend and guest.
5
By far the best bar we visited in Singapore. Great hosts . The owner Ernest introduced us to a few of his prized home made spirits. Will def return on our next visit to Singapore.
5
This was my second visit. Ernest is a great host.
Introducing us to his great artisan gins and vodka.
I highly recommend his bar.
Also they do some decent bar snacks particularly the garlic and truffle fried potatoes.

Hole in the wall, it really isn't, but this is one place where one won't feel too squeezed like other typical bars.Split into Shoebox Canteen and Bitters with just a slider, customers if sat in the bar area, probably can't have a proper dinner there(with the miniature tables, you probably won't want to anyway), the main dining area is a better bet if you want somewhere to chat.The cocktails here may not be as stunning as nearby 28HKS,or as mysterious as The Library. But the winning combination comes from the subtle surprise and intricate use of different ingredients.Drinks are rarely totally balanced; usually they take on specific characters that invite the patrons to explore taste profiles where one usually won't. Smoky, tropically sweet, saltiness, but no drink is a one-dimensional potion, unless one request for simplicity. There's always a second coming in each drink and it's pretty fun with each shake of the cocktail kaleidescope in Bitters.The vibe here is homely relaxed, but communal in the dining area. There's a mix of mainly locals with smattering of foreigners; have a chat with regulars, they'll let you in on the hidden secrets of this place.Tip: Come hungry. Their wagyu beef cubes are a perfect complement, but have them fast once served. Tofu sticks and the julienne-ed ham sandwiches are worth a try to
5
It was by chance that I visited Bitters & Love one night, but thank goodness I did!It has a list of creative mixes - with Kaya etc, great embellishments with the drinks. But aesthetics aside, the drinks are good! The flavors wake up one's tongue, and you definitely have the option to reduce the sweetness for some. (Just tell the bartender nicely!) Special mention to Steve who's talented in this. Have yet to try his Bah Ku Teh-infused cocktail. Yes, it's BKT! So yeah, highly recommended for those who wants to experiment with cocktails. About $20++ for one. Thrown a party/ big gathering there once, worked out fine
5
I've been to many cocktail bars that have menus with elaborate drink descriptions that promise a lot but deliver very little. Most drinks end up tasting like bad permutations of cough syrup. Finally I've found a bar which has managed to create perfectly balanced drinks that taste amazing and look beautiful. I tried 3 different bespoke cocktails in one night and each of them tasted completely different!! Bitters & Love's environment is intimate and quirky, owners and staff are friendly and welcoming, drinks and snacks delicious. Definitely my favorite bar in singapore!
5
It was packed on Saturday, but that did not make us leave and we managed to get a place at the end to enjoy great cocktails, good music, unique atmosphere and comfortable ambiance, and at the end... we spend the WHOLE NIGHT THERE! It was goooooooo
5
From my ultra bad cocktail bar experience in Sydney (read my review on The Baxter Inn) to this, the best bar I've probably been to, Bitters & Love in Singapore. Caught up with 2 old girlfriends at this bar they recommended last night and it was such a good experience. Service was so good - attentive and friendly... Oh and they drinks -- amazing, and worth every single cent. I even gave them a big tip, to which they came up to say thank you. I realised that it's not just the drinks and atmosphere that made me happy, it's the whole package - price, smile, service and drinks and food (oh, their waygu is so damn good too). I highly recommend this place everyone
5
Recommended by some mates to this indescript cocktail bar. We ordered the old fashioned + wagyu beef cube served on a sizzling pan. What a deadly combination. Overall it was great atmosphere, superb cocktails and fun bartenders!
5
No many signs pointing you to this bar. Look for shoebox canteen signage. Can get packed on Fridays and Saturdays but it has a great atmosphere. Great selection of gin and whiskey to choose from.
5
We have been to many cocktail bars in Singapore. By far bitters & love have been the best experience. Cocktails are spot on and they have knowledgeable bartenders. Love the banana pancake cocktail and the mangosteen queen cocktail made from fresh mangosteens!
5
A friend showed us this place. We had a really special experience. Great cocktails, very kind staff, with dedication and knowledge to find the perfect drink for you.
5
This place tranforms from a awesome lunch hangout with awesome food into a buzzing bar in the evening. Awesome atmosphere. An awesome couple runs this place - Ernest and Bev! Very friendly and knowlegable bar staff in Steve. Highly recommended!
5
So we ate at Shoebox Canteen for dinner and we peered through a ribbed glass door at the end of it. Beyond those doors was a hidden bar serving cocktails! What a different vibe: interesting lights made out of recycled gin bottles, tree branches above the bar, long marble countertop at the bar. Also they have an extensive range of craft spirits not found in other bars Recommended by the bartender: Banana Pancake cocktail, which comes in a glass bottle smoked with hay. Kaya Toast cocktail that uses locally made kaya jam (coconut and pandan flavour). We love the flavours, presentation and balance. Ended up staying for 4 more cocktails
5
We had a recent work event one evening at Bitters and Love although I have also been to the bar for social occasions too. Great atmosphere, cozy but chic and an amazing collection of spirits behind the bar. The best bit is that the staff are so knowledgeable about all of them! The food is delicious - I've had lunch at the Shoebox Canteen also which is a great lunch spot as well as an evening destination. So many bars in Singapore come with an attitude and a clientele to match but you won't find that here - you'll feel like a local in the best possible way! I would totally recommend for lunch, dinner, an after work drink or even to hire for an occasion
5
If Tom Hanks and Brian Brown were doing a remake of their famous movie in Singapore - this is where they would do it. The cocktails are incredible and so inventive. We recently held a small function here for 30 with a diverse range of tastes and requirements and all were more than satisfied. The team worked incredibly hard to ensure that every single person was tended to and received great food and drinks. Thanks to all of Bitters and Love for an amazing event!
5
My business partner and I organised an office function here based on recommendations and it was a huge hit with everyone. Bitters & Love catered drinks and canap√©s for 30 people and it was a constant stream of great food and amazing cocktails. They even created mocktails to suit individual preferences. Both Ernest and Beverly were on hand to help. They made everyone feel so welcome, making sure the food and drinks were to their liking. The support staff at Bitters is amazing as well , constantly checking on everyone. We would definitely recommend Bitters & Love to anyone wanting to hold a function or just have a quiet drink and eat amazing food. A Huge Shout of Thanks to Bitters & Love for making the night so enjoyable for everyone!!!!!!
5
Bitters & Love are probably one of the best cocktailbars in the town. It‚Äôs a bit hidden away from the rest, but its absolute a visit worth! Trust me.The bartenders have a lot of experience and can help you with just the taste you like, or if you want to experiment they have some really great infusions
