We had dinner here and ordered sashimi which was very good. The kurobuta nabe and asaari garlic chili also good. Good service and nice ambiance. Not exactly cheap but worth while. Will come back here again for other food.

This is a relaxing, well run, neighbourhood restaurant. The food is very fresh and the service is polite and helpful. The sashimi is excellent and the new chef is great. Definitely worth giving this one a try!

Nara Japanese Restaurant in Goldhill provide good quality food . Service staff are well trained .
The negative being , it's small and cramped .

This place has a nice ambience, great food and good service, ask the staff in advance when the fresh food arrives in the week. Ms Mei Lee offers good service and always remembers what our favourite dishes are.

We have good feeling after dinner at the restaurant recently. It was a normal Sunday...we're happy with the various dishes served and we definitely will come again the next time. It's pricey as compared to the normal restaurants you find in the shopping malls, but it serves good food....

Just finished our meal in this "hole in the wall" restaurant. My wife and I had the Aki Bento which was as good as any we had on our trips to Japan. Great service, excellent sake menu and mid-range prices. From the Novena MRT take the United Square underpass and when you come up a the other side take the first lane on the right. If your are sick of food court Japanese Nara is well worth a visit

Tiny, mid-price neighborhood restaurant. We were semi-regulars when we lived in the area (2006-2008) and popped in for a visit while transiting through Singapore. It still has excellent sushi, sushi maki, bento meals, tempura shrimp and vegetables with udon or soba noodles. Welcoming yet unobtrusive service. We spent $60 Singapore dollars for dinner for two (green tea included, no other drinks)

Had a business lunch with four people. The space is slightly tight if you need to talk serious business, but for networking it is great. It was well visited which is always a good sign.We had a selection of sushi and it was really good. Some traditional nigiri and some adventurous maki rolls. The rice was perfect and the fish just as I like it.The staff was attentive and kept filling up our tea cups when they were half full.The service was quick and the price ok. Not too expensive, but not cheap either.If you are in the neighbourhood it is really worth visiting

On 11 Jan 16, I and my siblings had a wonderful lunch at Nara Japanese Restaurant@Goldhill Centre (not to be confused with Nara Thai Restaurant originating from Bangkok: aside from the type of cuisine being served, the former refers to the historic city which was also the first capital of ancient Japan - as in ‘Nara Deer Park’ or ‘Nara Todaiji Temple’ - while the latter refers to one of the female Thai founders of the restaurant).Since it started operations some ten years ago, Nara@Goldhill has established a solid base of clientele support and patronage among both Singaporeans, tourists and Japanese expatriates. Although somewhat space-constrained, the cosy environment and décor, deliberately calibrated to be casual yet cultural, serve to promote greater conversation and socialisation among patrons while savouring quality fresh sushi and sashimi as well as a wide selection of Japanese spirits and Japanese food fare. Patrons have a choice of seating: counter, table or private rooms.Nara is thus today well-known for its wide variety of authentic and traditional Japanese cuisine: the different menus well attest to this achievement. There is a considerable range of nicely-priced items too.Staff were ever so attentive and observant (from a discreet distance), besides being very courteous and approachable for advice and recommendation on food choices, whenever this is sought for by patrons.The sushi/sashimi bento sets we ate (as depicted in photographs) were delicious and truly enjoyable

I been to this restaurant for my wife birthday, the food was good, the chef was polite and nice. When we enter all the service staff greeted us with a smile! The food was awesome! Portion was just nice for two of us! They hv promotion once awhile. It's a must try restaurant! Will.be back for more!

Food was OK. Told service staff to let customers know of S$5 charge for raw veg platter served without asking. Service was ok.

I come here regularly for my Japanese fix. Lunch offers very decent meals at good value. Quality and standards have remained consistently high. Service is discreet and unobtrusive. Ambience is quiet and cosy with low light settings. Highly recommend it.

We will never set foot here again. Four of us ate here last night. The food is so-so. The cook lacks imagination so there appears to be miso or tau chionh in everything! The sashimi was mediocre and poorly cut. The oil used to fry tempura was clearly stale. They messed up our orders resulting in a very extended meal. The 2 tables next to us who came later, ordered later, finished eating first! And finally, DO NOT accept the salad that they automatically put on your table when you sit down. They will charge you $5 for what is just a few leaves of cabbage, and several sticks of carrot and cucumber. I know restaurants nickel and dime you - $2 for peanuts and towels but $5??? This has got to be one of the worst Japanese restaurant experiences we've ever had. Even Sakae Sushi is far better and you pay a lot less

Nara is now on Chun Tin Road, near Beauty World.We went there twice on the last weekend. Once as a couple, once in a larger family group. The menu lists numerous Japanese classics as well as some slightly fusion dishes. On both occasions, we liked each and every dish, and were wowed by some.Really outstanding is the service: extremely attentive but discrete, they know your needs before you have to call them. Very friendly all the while.Certainly a place to come back to

Tucked away in the lane beside Goldhill Plaza, with low light ambience and a generous sushi bar, this restaurant presents fresh, great tasting sashimi and other Japanese staples at a realistic price. It was so good, I thought I must be eating in-house at one of the five- star hotels. Then the modest bill arrived. The Agadashi Tofu was a delight. Friendly attentive staff top it off
