I simply love the fried beehoon, fried chicken wings and Kopi-O. You can choose to dine indoor or outdoor.

Personally fall in love with their foods . Especially the Curry Chicken , fried chicken wings and Pineapple rice with chicken floss .
If you are a vegetarian person , you can order their vegetable curry and pratas too .

Its a small establishment. simple chinese food for breakfast and lunch. Very reasonable pricing. The prata is the best tho. very crispy and tasty. Good curry to go along with it. You only get 2 types. Plain and with egg. Really nice. Its in the Canberra Community Centre, beside the POSB ATM. indoor and outdoor seating
