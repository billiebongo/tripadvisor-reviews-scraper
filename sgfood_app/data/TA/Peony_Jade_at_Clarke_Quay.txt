Standard Service nothing shines nothing bad. Food portion small. Ambience ok. A typical Chinese restaurant.

We came here for a family lunch and went with the a la carte buffet. Food was excellent and so was the service. Great variety of dim sum and cooked dishes!

Love the Cantonese dim sum.
Reasonable variety of dishes to choose from the buffet ala-carte menu.
Highly recommended.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

1st visit. Was impressed by nice variety of chinese cruisines offered there.
To add on, ambience is good and venue provide a good place to chat.

Quite nice Chinese food. We were served as part of a tour group and maybe this influenced what they served. It was nothing special but reasonable.

This is one of the popular restaurants in Singapore. There are other branches in town, but the one in CLARK QUAY seems to be most popular, likely because of it's location. The restaurant is quite spacious and have special VIP rooms with a minimum spending by the guests. The service is good. The quality and quantity of food is acceptable and nothing exceptional. The ambience is acceptable is the dinning is done in the VIP rooms; else it may get noisy from the other diners, which are mostly Chinese. The location is near the Singapore River and about 10 minutes walk from the CLARK QUAY MRT. Many taxis around the area. ACCEPTABLE dinning place

We came here for the a la carte lunch buffet as someone in the group requested Chinese. Unfortunately, first impression was very bad.I was the first customer for the day and approached the supervisor who was at the cashier counter, located just by the door. He literally scowled at me for 'intruding' on him even though the restaurant was already open for lunch. I told him my reservation and he unhappily waved me to a table beside the counter and door. I asked for a better placed table and he said condescendingly that I could have a choice of another two tables. There were many tables in this restaurant and there were no customers. The two choices I was given were just next to the initial one and also steps beside two service stations. He commented icily that as we were a party of four we could only take these tables. Imagine my unhappiness when he gave a better placed table (that could take up to more customers) to the next customers who walked in. That table, and another, proved to be of four customers too. In short, he rejected the first customer armed with a reservation requesting a better table but gave it to others who turned up later even though they had the same number of people. What service. I don't mind if he had adhered to the policy of seating customers to their number but he turned back on his own words 5 minutes after my request. I would have walked out if I was not waiting for friends.It was a good thing we were eventually served by a waiter whom, though not offering fine dining service, was definitely willing to answer questions and take orders in a pleasant manner. Thank you, Kelvin, for salvaging the service experience on that day.Food wise, it was passable for a lunch a la carte buffet. Just don't expect fine Chinese food. There were a lot of items but most were dull and simple. The chef's selection, which were supposed to be the premium items and one could only order once, were actually disappointing. We wondered about the authenticity of the shar... never mind, try it yourself. Some items were alright in quality while some not too impressive.Mid way through the meal, as we were still waiting for some items to be served, the wait staff suddenly rained a few dishes on us - none of which was what we ordered. Turned out they were meant for the next table and our order was forgotten.The restaurant deco was very passe. They even have a small stage for presumably weddings and I suspect the restaurant relies heavily on weddings to survive since there were only a few tables of customers on that day.For the cost of $39++ per person, it was okayish. There were hidden charges even though it's supposed to be a buffet. Towels cost $2++ and tea $10++.With an offer from my credit card value tips the scale to their favour.Good a-la-carte Chinese lunch buffet is hard to find and the better ones impose a timed seating. So even though the food was just ok and service/environment was not too great, I may not mind dropping by one more time when it calls for a get-together lunch on a budget.

It was empty on a Thursday night for dinner. The AC was turned on too strong and it was just too cold to eat in this restaurant. We ordered quite a few dishes and the kitchen must have been slow (since no customers, I was surprised by this!) for some reason... suddenly all of our dishes arrived at the same time despite asking for a 'pace' ... thereafter our dishes got cold (and even faster due to the blasting AC) to eat. They tasted good, but we didn't get a chance to eat them when they were hot, at their authentic best. Service was slow and English was not the forte, my friend ordered in Chinese. A bit disappointing for all the hype that this restaurant has overall. Don't get me wrong the taste was high, but the experience left much else to be desired

Located at Clarke Quay, upstairs off the river is a beautiful restaurant. The food was simply GORGEOUS. The restaurant menu has "Chefs Special" all over it. We have all seen that before and been let down. Not here, the chef is a magician. When the waiter delivered a butter knife for my beef fillet, I must admit I thought to myself "That's confidence". The splendid piece of meat just fell apart, I barely needed a knife at all. Our food was amazing. We could see the chef peeping around the corner as we ate it, to make sure it was all we desired and it really was. We thanked him, but words fell short, as it was a very memorable meal. Great staff, great prices and its a fantastic restaurant for a couple or larger groups. Treat yourself, you deserve it.

We purchased a voucher to have dinner at this restaurant and were so looking forward to it. From the moment we walked in the Maitre D treated us like we were second class citizens. He looked at the voucher and then directed us to a table that had already been used, dirty tablecloth, no flowers on the table like all the rest. He removed the drinks menu off the table, saying that drinks were not included only tea and water, no chance to order anything.The food came out all at once, very gelatinous corn soup and at the same time a small plate of broccoli, 4 small prawns with cereal on them, a small chicken dish with onion and a plate of fried rice. At no stage did anyone talk to us or advise what the dishes were. We had to ask for drinks menu so we could order a drink. The dessert was 6 small pieces of fresh fruit that was dry.Overall this was a terrible experience for us as first time diners in Singapore. I can tell you the Hawkers markets food was so much better quality and we weren't treated so badly. We were in and out in 45 minutes!The Maitre D came across as extremely arrogant and that he shouldn't have to deal with us peasants!I reiterate, do not book or go to this restaurant for a meal

Very tasty duck with dumplings and tender venison. We had small portions which was sufficient as we could not finish the rice. Restaurant air on a little cool but good when it's very hot and humid outside.

Part of our tour coming off our cruise...the food was lovely..the staff didn't speak much English but understood our needs

nice ambience. daily soup was delicious. very good set up for Chinese wedding celebration . wide variety of set menus

Had a very nice meal, nicely prepared and presented. Upscale Cantonese with pleasing decor. Quiet second floor location. I would go back.

The red carpet staircases walking up gave a very mysterious feeling and then lead to a classy dining area

good chines food, pricey. Restaurant won many awards - dinner was good quality but I hoped it would be quite a level higher than other places I'd been to. the baked fish in soy was good, shrimps were nice, noodles decent - but really good was the mango / pomelo desert - that was amazing. aircondition was on arctic setting and the people we were with were really really cold. There were also some loud large group tables around which did not much for the atmosphere. Hoped to see some of that vaunted food that won awards and in the end had just a decent meal which was not chea

This restaurant provides nice authentic food without being anything special! The service was actually quite poor which is unusual for Singapore. We waited a long time for drinks and had to ask multiple times to get what we wanted. It would not be high on the return list unfortunately.

First off, Peony Jade was truly good, is what I wanted to say. Had a wedding dinner at PJthe other night. The menu included traditional Chinese dishes like roast duck, prawn salad, hot/sour soup and eternity fried noodles. Expectedly flavorful dishes. But what I truly liked were PJ's signature sautÃ©ed fresh prawn with creamy yolk, which had hints of salted egg flavour. Steamed sea grouper was fresh, tasty. The Australian abalone was also notable, esp with stir fried broccoli flower. Perfect end to the meal was the much anticipated chilled mango sago with pomelo sacs. Overall PJ service is tops, except for some issues with the halal food that was pre ordered. Other than that, pleasantly good meal. The wedding arrangement was done in a way that made the ambience so comfortable and not cramped despite the small layout. Very good first experience at Peony Jade. Can't wait to come back.

Attended a wedding lunch here. The food is good, although it may not appeal to some (e.g. noodles can be a bit too salty). I like some of the dishes such as the steamed sea bass, the fried salted egg prawns and mango pudding.There's free flow of beer in the restaurant, if you order a wedding menu that includes this item.The only thing is the layout of the restaurant. It is not a full rectangular shape, so if you are holding a wedding in this restaurant, you won't get to see all the guests from the stage in one go.Still, it's the event and food that counts. So this restaurant is good for it

Went to Peony Jade on spec. Very authentic restaurant and food. We had sweet & sour jumbo prawns - and they were huge and juicy!! - plain rice, garlic & ginger PAK Chou - which was extremely tasty and garlicky. We had ordered a honey roasted char Sui but were told that this wasn't available. Waitress pointed at another dish on the menu as an alternative & we agreed. When it came, the meat was like pieces of streaky bacon in a sauce, however it was very tasty!!We had an extremely tasty meal which was very authentic. Not the cheapest but then little in Clarke Quay is cheap.If you are in Clarke Quay and want an authentic meal, give Peony Jade a try

Came for a family meal, not cheap but good quality food> Really enjoyed the roasted duck and slow fire suckling pig combinations though the grouper was a bit disappointing and underwhelming. Only would come here for really special occasions.

Stopped here for lunch as part of a tour and it was very nice. Pork dumplings were very nice, as was mushroom soup. Meal also included sweet and sour pork (nice) rice, broccoli and dessert. All food was very tasty, restaurant was beautiful.
3
The atmosphere was nice, but the food itself was very average and service very slow. Not particularly impressed and they were not able to deal well with a big group and get food out quickly.

Peony Jade has always been one of my first choice when it comes to Chinese Cuisine.Especially for people new to Singapore. If you crave for Chinese food and in restaurant setting. Then Peony Jade@Clarke Quay is one you have to try. The setting is quiet and comfort level is excellent for business lunch or for discussion. I had been to both Lunch and dinner. The restaurant is on second level. Don't be afraid of the staircase or lift. Just head up and enjoy your dining experience on Chinese Cuisine. Always order Fried Prawns with Wasabi Mayo(must try), if it's in the menu

I love to walk into a restaurant without planning and try to surprise myself. Clarke is very busy with locals and tourists but don't be put off. It's was not overly busy but it was quite late. Service was very good, food choice and quality were very good too. Considering where is is, it was not overly expensive. A smart casual restaurant, but don't feel out of place in shorts. A nice dining experience

First trip to Singapore and first night staying on Clarke Quay. This restaurant is on the pricy side but that keeps the riff riff out and we got a table without waiting.Went for a set menu and was impressed with the quality and variety of dishes, all beautifully presented.Service was a bit hit and miss, dishes served simultaneously to all 4 of us, with an explanation of what we were getting, but dishes removed from each diner as they individually finished a course, leaving the last to finish a bit isolated.All in all, a good meal in nice surroundings
4
Clarke quay is a very nice outside dining experience. Many restaurants to choose from. Nice atmosphere with an overhead canopy that changes color all the time. Only downside is each restaurant plays it's own music plus there is overall music played in the common area. These 2 compete with each other and can be a bit annoying

Third time here and things have changed quite a bit from previous visits however the venue itself is still lovely with a peaceful ambiance. The menu has changed and also the wine selection is much more limited. As on previous visits we felt a little out of our depth being the only Caucasians. To enjoy and appreciate the great cuisine I think at least 6 diners are needed for a bigger variety of dishes that can be shared. However with just 3 of us we still enjoyed our meal of the Chef's specials of wood smoked duck with flower buns, miso baked cod, and salted egg yolk prawns with curry leaves. The prawns were even better than I remembered from previous visits and remain my favourite dish.The soft shelled crab dish was a little strange to our taste being coated in a very dry (but tasty) pork floss. The crab itself was the best tried, but we felt some sort of sauce would have enhanced the dish. Perhaps a dipping sauce based on lime, ginger and chili would complement the dish.The fried rice dish was superb and so unlike any fried rice at your local takeaway in Australia. Service from the staff was as always, helpful, pleasant, efficient and friendly

Our second visit excellent to this Clarke Quay restaurant was as good as previously some years ago, the three of us again being the only non-resident diners apparent. The room is pleasant and welcoming with plenty space between tables. The staff were attentive and helpful, and the food, as before, of excellent quality - duck, prawns and fish. All lovely. We would always return here, confident of a good evening, and would recommend the restaurant again with confidence

This was a return trip for us to Singapore after 17 years away. It was nice to see the way the restaurants along the river have developed but we were after authentic local food like we could get all that time ago and were struggling to find one amongst the Italian, French and Spanish themed restaurants. Peony Jade is just what we were after and it was great to enter their air conditioned restaurant and shelter from the humidity. The food was gorgeous; the house special smoked duck in buns, fish & ginger; crispy noodle with seafood; pork ribs and seasonal vegetables were sublime. The house white wine was very nice too.

This area is Fantastic! But this hotel and bar is not up to the mark. They are selling with very price but services are not so good!

Had 3 dishes. Not real Cantonese or Szechuan as promoted. Sweet cashew snack. Black pepper beef was soggy, not seared outside. Mixed vegetables over-cooked. Perch baked in miso sauce was also sweet. In short, did not show any real cooking skills.
5
We stumbled across Peony Jade whilst looking for an evening meal after a long work day and boy did we get a meal! The Service was quick and the food was absolutely fabulous. We ordered way too much and still managed to finish it all, it was too good to leave. I can't really recommend one dish as everything was just so nice...although I still have day dreams about the Broccoli side dish we had. A simple dish with astonishing flavours. I wish I had a local Chinese this good

Came here for a business dinner. It's located strategically in the food and night life hub of Clarke Quay.Its setting including the bathroom are extremely impressive, modern and clean. Quite different to it's heritage-looking exterior.The food came quickly and in perfect temperature and presentation. My dear colleagues ordered the famous Peking duck and chili crab, among other dishes. They were both extremely delicious.Will definitely return again. Did not give 5 star as nothing special stood out
5
The standard and quality of the food here is very high and good. Almost every dish is very delicious. Thumbs up for the chefs there. My fav dish is the salted Egg Prawn. The taste is very strong and the prawn they used is very fresh. Other fantastic dishes would be their Shark's Fins soup, Steamed Soon Hock Fish. Coffee Spare Ribs is also well done. Their service is also very attentive and good. Place is very clean and easy to find.A good place for couples and family.

Went for the a la carte dinner buffet with my family and all of us were quite impressed with the overall food quality. Good quality Cantonese and sze chuan dishes. Dishes that stood out for me will be the abalone, free range roast chicken, sze chuan cold chicken, cappucino spare ribs. Too many dishes on the menu and we couldn't possibly try all. But with what I had, I believe the quality of the other dishes should be good too. Service was also quite prompt in serving of the dishes and tea. Price is a bit steep at about $50. Will be good if go in a big group so that you can try more dishes. All said, satisfying dinne

Excellent location in the heart of Clark Quay. Service is excellent dedicated servers per table, ensuring you have endless amounts of Chinese tea and clean crockery. Food is good value for money. Can definitely recommend Chilli Crab with fried Mantou and Roast crispy chicken with Szechuan Hot Sauce. After dinner there are plenty of bars along the quay for cocktail
4
This is a small Szechuan/Cantonese cuisine restaurant on 2nd floor near Singapore river at Clarke Quay. You can order ala carte or buffet. There are Tim sum dishes too.Food and service are good. Plates are changed often and waitresses are attentive to pour tea and water.Good lunch crowd on a Saturday. We had to make reservation
4
Had a PDR experience here with business associates. Good service. Good location. Simple yet Good ambience.Food good. Stewardess was overenthusiastic but handled it well. Supposed to be one of the good authentic Chinese food joints. Wide selection. Not overpriced. Could manage only vegetarian dishes too for vegetarians. Recommended for friends, family and corporate get togethers

Good selection of standard Chinese food. Shark-fin soup available for those who don't mind the thought of sharks dying in agony in order to satiate their desire for exotic cuisine. Tables are a little large so it can be tricky to gain access to the food in the centre, but no complaints about the quality
