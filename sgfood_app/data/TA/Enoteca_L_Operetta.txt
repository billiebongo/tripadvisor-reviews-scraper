The Italian restaurant Enoteca L'Operetta, located at Boat Quay, served nice pizza. We got a nice table right at the edge of the dock. The meal ended with a really yummy Tirramizzu.
2
The only thing that is good is that their pasta is "al dente". the flavor is not savory. waiters are a not friendly (they don't smile and they are very stiff). they seem to be uncomfortable when we asked questions about their menu.
4
Had dinner here twice and ordered pizza take-out once; this place never disappoints. T bone steak was very nicely prepared to my preference and pizza is always done to perfection. Could not say the same about duck pasta dish (could be improved) but ambience is good, service staff are attentive and welcoming
4
We got "Gnocchi al quattoro formaggi" witch was excellet, the sauce was delicious and the gnocchi were very well cooked. We also got "Spaghetti con nero di seppia", this dish it was just ok, the sauce didn't taste like squid ink and it was very salty. For dessert we got tiramisu and a chocolate lava cake, both were incredible
5
We had an early dinner here on our last night in Singapore. We chose a table outside next to the river which was lovely although I also went inside the restaurant and the décor in there was great and would really suit a romantic dinner. We had the burrata and Parma ham salad which was delicious - we chose the full portion and thankfully we were sharing as the serving was huge! My husband chose a pizza for his main, it had a thin, crispy base and was one of the nicest pizzas he has had outside of Italy. I ordered the wagyu Bolognese; the sauce was rich and full of flavour and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The staff were friendly and attentive and the bill was really reasonable especially by Singapore standards
4
L'Operetta is located on walking street with many others restaurants, all of which are trying to encourage you to eat in theirs. I had a Margettia Pizza which was quite nice, especially the richness of the tomato sauce, and glass of red wine. Including tax and 10% service, which is added I paid 42 or $30. The service was good and the view of the city skyline was awesome
5
We have not been to this restaurant for some time and after reading some negative reviews about the food, we were not too sure but we thought we should give it a try.The food was indeed very nice and taste authentic. It is exactly how food taste in Italy. The pasta with sea urchin was great. The deco inside the restaurant is modern and chic. There are also tables outside overlooking the river. Service is also very good
5
A very real feeling Italian restaurant along the quay by the Singapore River. They know how to cook Italiano with pomodoro, alio e olio e basilico.Wife had linguine al granchio crab and tomato pasta which was quite savory. I had a pizza napolitana. Thin crust with generous tomato sauce, anchovies, oregano and black olives. Luscious. At last a superior pizza without cheese, Just like we got in Sorrento, Napoli and Salerno.Bravo. Came with nice bread, olive oil and Balsamic
3
I never had Hokkaido uni pasta before, so had to come over and try. The green salad with burrata was nice, the burrata tasted quite fresh. The uni pasta was an interesting combination, and not bad at all, but the uni could be of better quality. My husband had the crab linguine which was not all that good
1
This was once a nice restaurant, with good food and spot-on service. All this has gone. I suspect the place changed owner (and chef) and the food now is terrible and for sure no longer authentic.Service has followed the same path, with unfriendly and inattentive waiter who certainly didn't add anything positive to the already quite negative food experience we had.For sure we won't retur
5
We from Italy. I want just say the gnocchi was superbe! The staff really gently and friendly . Ah the last thing... You must to try the tiramisu! Soooo good! Arigatō
4
The food here is beautifully presented and delicious. The wait staff were very attentive. Great experience of dining on the waterfront. Just watch out for the price of the alcohol...ouch!!
2
Several months ago we had the best crispy-based pizza here so headed back a couple of weeks ago looking forward to more of the same. However, our order took forever to arrive and when it did, oh so disappointing, flabby undercooked base and very uninteresting top. We pointed this out to our waiter who referred it to the chef who offered to replace the pizza. This all took quite a while. However by that time we were over it all and left, not to return! But must mention that the bill was waived. A pity because L'operetta is in such a good location by the river
4
Went there with my colleague and clients for lunch. I chose the set lunch which is about SGD32. Starter is veg salad , main steak and desert is Tiramisu. I have to say that it was actually quite good food and especially the steak which was perfectly seasoned and cooked. However the service is a little bit shaky and waiters were not attentive enough
1
I am very sad... This place used to be one of my favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore. I have been there many times 2 or 3 years ago. The restaurant user to have very good ingredients, good cooking, good location. What a bad surprise when I tried it again, one of my worst experience in Singapore. Clearly, there has been a change of management and chief. We shared a starter (the mixed plate) which used to be really nice in that restaurant. That was a clear rip off: a plate with a microscopic piece of ham and mozzarella, that looks very empty, very sad and in addition the not even good. Moving to the main dish was not better. Ravioli that were supposed to be homemade were really bad. The ones from the supermarket definitely taste better. The sauce that came with it was completely off. A mix of bad Oliv oil with some bad tomato sauce. My wife tried another pasta - bongole - that was average. Wine was not very good either (we had 3 glasses) And all that for 170sgd.... I believe the new management must have decided to go for the short game and outragously maximize the margin by using the well established name of the restaurant to for high price a ridiculously low quality food.

After a couple of disappointing dinner experiences this trip to Singapore we struck lucky at Boat Quay last night. Location ✅✅✅✅✅Service ✅✅✅✅✅Food. ✅✅✅✅✅Thoroughly enjoyed our final night's dining in this fantastic city and would recommend this restaurant if thinking of eating out at Boat Qua
5
This restaurant was a very nice surprise. All the meals I have had in Singapore have been slightly disappointing. Generally the city offers slow to poor service and food that could be better and all at prices that are very high. This restaurant was the exception. I had not tried it before as Italian food in Singapore did not seem an attractive choice. However, the food was superb and the service was first class. Location by the river is good
4
Had business lunch choosing the Set Lunch for S$38.00++.A "big" budget for lunch but the Iberico Pork set ( 3 course ) was well worth it.Service was good, though restaurant was 90% full, attentive service, non intrusive and very polite. Noise level was acceptable for the crowd level.Will visit their others restaurant in Singapore.Tips: Lunch set is reasonable (S$28 set and $38 set) but if you want to splash, Dinner $90-125. Well suited for business and also to bring your special someone, located alongside the river
4
An easy walk from CBD at the North Bridge End of Boat Quay. Good quality Italian food at a restaurant run by Japanese people. I had the set lunch with salad, pizza and dessert and it was all good quality and good portion sizes. My wife had lobster soup started followed by the sea bass which she really enjoyed. The food was well presented and service was good. We sat outside at the little tables near the restaurant. We were a bit lucky as it was cooler than normal just after a rainstorm. Inside can be a little bit cramped and chilly with the A/C. Dinners on the water are better as it is cooler in the evenings
4
In between dozens of crab places, touristy area, we didn't expect much but they surprised us. Very friendly service, very good food at decent prices. Insalata mista is to die for with fresh mozzarella and prociuto. Pizzas are the best we ever tried in Singapore. I need to check if they deliver
5
Great location and the food was absolutely delicious. The staff was very friendly. The restaurant is a bit more expensive, but worth it.
5
Seita-san does a fabulous job in the kitchen combining simple Italian cooking with the freshest ingredients. Try anything from pizza to uni pasta. Can't go wrong.
4
looking for a place to have a bite to eat on Boat Quay after work we find this little restaurant and it looks nice with its terrace on the river facing Marina bay. we had a lovely dinner, pizzas, pasta and a nice bottle of wine. the service was nice and attentive, very polite and helpful. It was a nice relaxing moment which makes us feel like if we were on holidays. we'll be back ;)
5
Ate here on the last night of our trip to Singapore and had an excellent meal. Good quality food in excellent location at the quieter end of boat quay. My wife had linguine whilst I had pizza and both were of a high standard. Service was first rate and whilst not the cheapest meal we had during our stay, it was well worth it and compared favourably with Italian food we have eaten both in Italy and London. The wine list is extensive with some excellent Italian wines though like all wine in Singapore, not cheap. Overall a superb meal and great way to end our trip. (By chance it also had an excellent view of the laser show from Marina Sands
4
Ate an early dinner here, and it really is a nice spot. Away at the end closest to Clarke Quay, opposite the Parliament House on the river, we really enjoyed our experience.Food was tasty - not out of this world, but still good. Portions were a decent size and my wife and I were both full after 1 pasta and a salad starter that we shared.Service was very professional, not pushy at all.And the outside seating area is much nicer than others along Boat Quay - that's for sure.Overall a great experience, and I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more

Dear All, today 11 September , i had the pleasure to test the real Napolitan Pizza in Singapore , trough the Pizzeria L ' Operetta . Kindly note i m Napolitan , and today i order a take way pizza as my office is located in Boat Quay . Immediately i had the sensation to be in my lovely city " Naples " . Believe or not i felt the obligation to go back personally to congratulate with the Pizzaiolo , unfortunately i had already finished the lunch services . I asked to the Chef where he learned to make pizzas , obviously in Naples. Kindly i would like to ask you , before to make any comments about the Italian Food , specially Pizza go to Naples enjoy our real food and then you can be in position to make comments. The real Napolitan Pizza is not CRISPY AT ALL . My personal thank you to the PIZZERIA L OPERETTA . GRAZI
5
Enoteca L'Operetta has become one of our favorite Italian restaurants in Singapore now. We feel always welcoming whenever we go. The chef is so dedicated for his creations and simply amazing! We've tried many dish and all excellent!!! Our favorites are sea urchin pastas, Linguine with scampi, beef tagliata and Milanese. Don't miss their directly imported Italian wines! The smart sommelier is very helpful what to select. Go for his recommendations! Overall, I believe this is the best Italian in town
4
On my set lunch search I found Enoteca at Boat Quay. I'm not a fan of over priced restaurants in Boat Quay, just tourist traps with large Fish tanks and large price menus. Small beer glasses. For $28.00++ I had a fabulous meal. I saw the menu had 8 choices of entrees, not just 2-3.I choose the Mushroom soup, very creamy and sweet, and then Crabmeat Penne in a Rose Cream sauce, lots of crabmeat, very good portion size. Fresh hot breads, I just made a fondue with the sauce!I saw 3 types of dessert, tiramisu, but I was so full I couldn't find the room! I saw some pizzas go buy, they looked good also. Nice dÃ©cor, with table runners, I even saw a waiter ironing the tablecloths as he replaced them! Nice smooth touch...As always you pay a lot more for dinners, but a set lunch is always a good way to sample the fare of a place before you "dish" out big dollars.Good service too, will go back again. Cia

After all the recommendations and great reviews the place has, we finally made it to give it a try. Unfortunately I cannot share what other customers experienced at this place.Despite a reservation they made us wait for 15 min and didn't even offer a drink or something. When we finally got our table the starter arrived before the drinks and the whole service seemed quite uncoordinated.The food itself: burrata & calamari as a starter were average but the all the pizzas were all bland and not crispy at all. The location and atmosphere is very nice especially the outside seating area at the river
5
As you stroll down the many eateries and drinking holes down Boat Quay, it is easy to get bamboozled on which one to go for, but as you continue to walk down, you will be amazed as to what awaits you.Enoteca L'Operetta is a great little place - looks very upmarket and refreshing, but it is modestly priced compared with similar classes of restaurant. The service is attentive, the food quality superb and the portion sizes are perfect, and overall a great ambiance to relax and chill at the quieter end of Boat Quay.It is also nice for a romantic or intimate dinner, although it does cater for all tastes and groups. I would definitely recommend paying a visit if you fancy something quieter, more relaxing and something different along Boat Quay
4
Hidden a short walk from the more noisier bars on boat key this is a lovely Italian restaurant. Although on the expensive side the food is excellent along with a nice choice of good wines. Highly recommended if you are looking for Italian in Singapore.
4
Excellent food , good location but extremely overpriced . The spread for lunch and dinner is awesome with some nice wines to go with it .
5
We had not booked a table and although they looked busy we were led to the perfect table for two on the waters edge. The food is very traditional Italian but very well prepared and and delicious. I ordered Caprese salad and was advised by the waiter to choose a slightly more expensive Burratta Mozzarella which was gorgeous. The pasta was very good and we had a very good Valpolicelli wine to accompany it. It was a such a good evening. One of the better restaurants on the Quay
4
When I think of great Italian food, there is a combination of food passion, great ingredients and a creative mind by the chef. Having four different dishes;- Signature scallops .... Alright- Sea Urchin Pasta .... Divine- pork ragout pasta .... Beautiful and rich - and to end it, signature smoked pork dish .... Wow! (Small portion is enough to share between two people if not a big appetite)The combination of passion, creativity with great ingredients is what you will find here at Enotica L'Operetta. I applaud chef Seita and his team. Finally, it can be tough to find great service in Singapore. The team of servers was a couple of notches higher than any great restaurant I have been in Singapore. Highly recommend this restaurant both for service, quality and great food.

The restaurant offers both indoor and alfresco dining- both decorated in pure whites. Dazzling to the eyes, for sure, and brings out the simple elegance of the restaurant. Lovely European decorations indeed, from outdoors to indoors. Never a fan of white color, ebut I must admit that this time, I am dazzled - the place looks so sparkling clean and pretty. The staff are friendly and polite, and I would say, rather efficient as all our requests were attended to without preamable.First, it was the Ravioli Stuffed with Veal. The ravioli here are shaped in tiny rectangles, and I loved it on sight. The sandy taste of the cheese coupled with the very, very soft and yummy veal - the ravioli practically melts in the mouth! - made us realize instantly that we had made the right choice.As if this wasnt enough, the Risotto with Black Pork was another amazing concotion of arborio rice, tasty gravy and tiny pieces of black pork, all cooked to perfection - sticky, chewy, bursting with flavors. This dish is a keeper!For more detailed information and photos, please visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/dinner-at-enoteca-loperetta.htm

We happened across this restaurant following a walk along the riverside. It looked lovely and had a table available next to the river, a really romantic setting.We didn't particularly know what to expect in terms of the menu, but we were completely impressed. Lovely scallop, enjoyable spaghetti, fairly priced wine (for Singapore) all made for a great experience
5
My wife and I had a sunset dinner on the river there after visiting a nearby museum then reading reviews on line. My wife had a pasta dish which was, she said, good but not outstanding. I had one of the chef's recommendations. Braciol De Maiale Alla Griglia or Iberico pork smoked in Japanese cherrywood with dried tomatoes and a butter sauce. The best pork dinner I have ever eaten. Flavorful and juicy. Just excellent. Service was very good and the setting next to the fever was perfect. Highly recommended
4
We visited this restaurant after a long day of walking and sightseeing and merely picked the first and best restaurant we came across. And what a great choice. The service was fast and polite and the food was good. Furthermore, the view by the river is something special. Particualrily as the sun comes down and the night settles
5
I visited the restaurant two days in a row. L'Operetta came highly recommended from an Italian friend living in Singapore and he was right. The first night I enjoyed a great oven fired pizza. It was so good I wen back the next day to try one of their pastas. The ravioli must extremely good. I was fortunate to have the same waiter two days in a row and received fabulous service. If the food and the staff aren't reason enough to visit. The view and ambiance of the river and view of the city and the Marina Bay Sands is great. I wish my wife could have been with me because this is a romantic place to be
4
I was initially skeptical about the restaurant, given it's strategic location in a commercialised tourist belt area. I chose this restaurant mainly based on positive reviews I'd read. The skeptic in me was proved wrong as I found everything from service to food and ambience faultless. We had the fetuccine alla marinara con curry delicato and the panna e prosciutto which even my friend agreed was one of the best we had ever tasted. The pasta was al dente, the prawns fresh, and crabmeat tender. The waiter also bothered that we were sharing and took the trouble of separating the pasta into 2 portions. The pizza base was full of herbs and tasted almost like ciabatta done well. The ham added just an adequate touch of saltiness to the pizza. Overall, a great dinner experience
4
L'operetta has great thin pizzas: try the napolitana or margarita.
All their pastas are made in house, as well as their desserts.
Tiramisu is light and fresh, the chocolate mousse is rich, heavy, and very smooth. Well worth a visit
4
I can only say it is the Best Pizza in Singapore and I usually pay a visit at least once a month. It's incredible when you find out the pizzaiolo is Japanese guy... actually nobody apart from the Manager is Italian, nevertheless it still has the best pizza in Singapore. Being from Naples (Italy) where we are extremely picky with pizzas, I have to admit that in Singapore, Japanese make a better pizza than Italians! I tried to have a pizza in several Italian restaurants in Singapore but none of them believe it or not are on the level.My personal favorite one is 'La Diavola' with Salame piccante.Enjoy
4
Located just by the bridge at Boat Quay with a colonial feel view of the parliament buildings across the river the service was truly outstanding and the food very good, Having been raised to eat everything on my plate I was quite happy with the fact that the portion sizes weren't of the usual obscenely large variety so you could manage to fit in three courses without having to be wheeled home on a sack barrow.The ambience is very pleasant, a choice of a pleasantly decorated interior or tables next to the water which attracted a nice cool breeze that perfectly offset the humidity
5
What an amazing restaurant! My boss brought us to this restaurant for farewell celebration. Good atmosphere and exceptional service as the people there is kind and friendly. The food was good quality, fresh and fantastic.. I like the FETTUCINE MARINARA - fettucine with prawn and BRACIOLA MAIALE - grilled Iberico pork rack, its yummy!! I will definitely recommend to all my friends. :
5
For those looking for a great, reasonably priced restaurant with a good location and good atmosphere, I would highly recommend Enoteca. The service was fantastic (my father accidentally spilled his almost-full beer, emptying its contents on the table, and the waiter replaced it with no extra charge -- this has to be a rarity in Singapore) and the pizza was seriously tasty and filling. The pizzas are about $16-26, but they're big enough to share. I went with my mother and father, and we shared two pizzas and were quickly full. The desserts are also to die for: I'd recommend the Crema Catalina for desert: half frozen caramelized pudding. Given its location right on the riverfront in Boat Quay, I'd say this place is one of the best values in the city
5
The Management of this restaurant deserve applause for their food, very accommodating service and place. I am not an Italian however I've been looking for a great place to eat Italian food and I thought that Singapore wont give me such opportunity to find one. The first encounter in this restaurant was awesome. I ate with some of my good friends and since its one of the recommended place to eat for Italian food, we didn't think twice of giving it a try. from the Pizza to the pasta everything seems tasty and the recipes seems to be unique. I love every bite and will go back for more
5
I often hear a lot of great recommendation about this place from friends and other sites, so finally.. we decided to come on one Friday night. Its really more than we expected!!I can say that this is one of the best dinner I ever had in months! Each dish was orchestrated so well with the variety of local and even intl ingredients .. We order Omakase and just leave it to the Japanese Chef to prepare food for us, Just like young kids we were thrilled with every dish as we dont know what will come out next. Even though the restaurant is full at that time, the service staff is very accomodating and cheerful. We sit at alfresco and enjoy the water front view. Italian Manager also recommends us a very good wine. Over all Its a happy evening. We will surely return to try some more of the dish
5
I am Italian, and admittedly I don't often hang around Italian restaurants in Singapore because it is difficult, in my opinion, to find genuine flavours that stick to the original: most of the times, dishes and recipes are adjusted to make the preferences of the international clientèle fit to their expectations, at the cost of veering off (more or less, depending where you eat) to what it is supposed to be, food-wise. I have been disappointed few times.We went to this restaurant with a group of friends which have been here before a number of times. That was already a good indicator as I know the standard of my friends. We were positively surprise by the authenticity of the dishes, and the great set up that undoubtedly reminds of a restaurant that could be in Italy, with no exception on any aspect. Furthermore, the position right on the Singapore river makes it definitely great, it will put a smile on your face in case you don't have already one.Both myself and my wife had a risotto, and the quality was as it should be. Well cooked, balanced flavours with no overdoing of ingredients. I had a dessert too, tiramisu' which was very much done the old way and that it is difficult to find.My rating should be read in the contest of restaurant of same level.A really nice discovery, which also was matched by a really good service. A place we will definitely visit again many times in future
5
Walking along the atmospheric Boat Quay in Singapore,we passed the varied restaurants trying to decide where to enjoy our first evening in Singapore. We settled on L'Operatta,and enjoyed a traditional Italian meal,the staff being attentive and patient with our attempt to pronounce the menu correctly. Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants we have been lucky enough to find
4
After 6 months of Asian food, I wanted a simple pizza and I was not disappointed by the simplicity and rich flavors of the dishes we tried: bruschetta with juicy and sweet cherry tomatoes, great bagnacauda with vegetable to dip in, good minestrone and a great pizza, one of the best I've had here....although owner and chef are Japanese, but with Italian experiences! Even the espresso was not great, but also not bad....Prices are acceptable to be here and in Boat Quay (1 margherita for $18++). On the other hand, service has a lot to improve, especially in terms of friendliness and engagement with the guest and some décor were questionable..
2
After not being noticed for a while, whe where served poorly and given good burrata and minestrone and awful sweet pene araviata and sweet spaghetti in cuttlefish ink. I returned the spaghetti in asked for a salad.
I was charged for the spaghetti!
4
The restaurant is in a decent location at Boat's Quay. Relaxing, yet in a lively enough area. Service was excellent and one waiter in particular combined politeness and humour in near-unbeatable fashion. Some of the staff, including the manager, were European, which is obviously not the norm in Singapore. Us three veggies shared an ortelano, quatrro formaggia and funghi pizza. All three were gorgeous and arrived in reasonable time. My vanilla ice cream was small, but again my taste buds were rewarded. I would describe this as a more 'authentic' pizza place than most other Italians on the island. The only downside is that we had to ask for bill on more than one occasion, but I cannot grumble on the quality of the food served
5
Lets be honest, the boat quay is busy and touristy, and alot of the food and service there is questionable. But the location is great, on the river, looking across to the theatre. Its a special place to eat outdoors.So this is what trip advisor is for.If you want good Italian food, in a great location, and to sit outdoors, knowing that the people in the other restaurants left and right are not getting such a good deal, then you know your time on trip advisor was well spent
4
We had a birthday dinner here a few days ago and when I was made aware of the location I was hesitant to say the least. Boat Quay being such a tourist trap by reputation you don't expect that much quality and ambiance. Well, this was very different and a delightful dinner. A must try on the starters list is the asparagus in crepes with egg on top, delicious. The burrato, the cold cuts, the octopus, all very good. Same goes for the various Risotto's we had and the ravioli. The baby chicken was a bid of a disappointment, but still good in taste and quality. The wine list is covering all areas in Italy and the Brunelo we picked certainly was worth it. Great alternative again to many other high-end Italian places
3
We went to L'Operetta last night, it was my third time at the restaurant. Lots of people don't know of this restaurant's existence, but it is in a great spot away from the bars in Boat Quay with a pretty spot on the water's edge - I always sit outside.The food at this place is really good and the pizzas are very yummy. However, the whole experience was such a let down yesterday due to the service. It's not that anyone was rude or did anything particularly bad, but it just felt a bit chaotic with no management. We ordered our food, and the starters came really quickly. Then the mains arrived literally after only two bites of the starters! The bottle of wine we had ordered still remained unopened in the ice bucket and we had to send the mains back and call someone over to open our wine. We then noticed that all the other tables had bread baskets, so we asked for some. Eventually, our mains arrived for the second time and when we had nearly finished the bread basket arrived! It was just all over the place with food coming at random times and no one overseeing the table. At the end of the meal, I had to wait 15 minutes for the return of my credit cardAs mentioned it was not like anything was terrible, but it made the whole dining experience a bit disappointing
4
It is located in Boat Quay and offers the possibility to eat either inside or outside just on the river.The (Italian style) food is of very high quality (also for Italian like myself) and the wine list offers a very good selection.The pizza here is excellent! Even in Italy is not easy to find the same quality
4
If you are looking for a real italian pizza, as they make in Napoli (where pizza was born, Naples for americans), this is the place. Not only the pizza is very well made and cooked but also the quality of the ingredients appears to be very good. Before pizza we had a fish carpaccio and it was also very good. We were four and we spent about S$50 per person, including a S$50 wine bottle (quite expensive, as all the wines in Singapore). Our table was right on the river, with a very nice with of Singapore skyline, so the total experience has been very pleasant
5
This was a truly unexpected elegant restaurant. From the moment we called ahead to book a table through to the end of the meal, the service was exemplary. Once we arrived, the welcome was so genuine. Friday night is Pizza night in our family and my partner was not disappointed, in fact, he was impressed, the Bagna Cauda was so fresh, and the marinated chicken with my requested asparagus was just perfect. The menu is well pitched, with good choices, I would like to see more fish on the menu, the wine list is good and the Reidel 'Eve' decanter was quite a showpiece! My partner's dessert, chocolate fondant with icecream looked and tasted superb. A memorable evening, we will be back!
4
High quality Italian food personable service and excellent wine selection list. The chef is very well trained and experienced and brings a Japanese sensibility to Italian food. Recommend their special pizza with honey, walnut and blue cheese combination and which is available as their signature dish. Though most people may blanch at the thought the pizza is really different and tasty
3
I decided on this restaurant due to a friend's recommendation. I was doubtful of how good it could be since Singapore has been quite disappointing when it'd come to both service and food quality.The ambiance is very nice, dimly lit at night, located along the river on Boat Quay in a quiet place. There's some original artwork( by the owner?) The waiters are all friendly and accommodating- our waiter seemed like a newcomer and was very friendly but maybe not very experienced- he tended to ask us how our food was repeatedly and seemed very nervous. We came for dinner but did not plan to go for the course menu, although the waiter did encourage it a few times (there is a course menu of 4 courses for $88++ and about $128 if you want it with wine pairings). He recommended a nice Chardonnay, but as with most restaurants in Singapore, wine is expensive. The wine list starts from $58. We ordered the Banacauda (vegetables with heated anchovy dip), which was very good, the Bismark pizza was not bad, my Spaghetti Ai Ricci di Mare (sea urchin) was alright but not the best I've had- the sea urchin was not super fresh, and the Fettucine alla Marinara Con Curry Delatico was tasty but too salty. We planned to order coffee, but were told they did not serve decaf so just went with dessert, Tiramisu and Crema Catalana. The Catalana was very nice, like a Crème brûlée on a plate. But I found the presentation a bit sloppy and not as sophisticated as you'd expect. Overall, I'd say this is a great place to have an intimate dinner if you are not too picky on the details. I may be comparing it to experiences in Tokyo, where everything is about small details-and therefore was a bit disappointed
