The Rooftop Bar is excellent for a drink and photos. We got some great photos here. Great views.... The drinks were quite good. And the staff were very helpful.

I found this place very cool, even the food served was delicious. A quiet good experience, should go if you have some time.

I visited with a group of 30 for a night of relaxed entertaining, after reading the thursday night promotions. unfortunately the thursday night promotions had finished?, still on the website though.
Staff were not overly interested so we end up leaving after 2 drinks.

the menu is pretty short but the food presentation is very nice. The food is good quality but not quantity. The prices are very reasonable. Don't try the bar at roof top. Its average. No air conditioning so it's hot. Noisy traffic too and no great view.

On top of the Fullerton River Boathouse is Prelude bar, a rooftop bar with great views across the water and a relaxed, chilled out atmosphere. My wife and I met a friend for pre-dinner drinks and were met in a comfortable environment where the waitress was attentive but not overly so. The drinks were kept topped up but the conversation was barely interrupted which is not always achieved in other similar venues. A good night was had by all and this certainly got things kicked off in a great way

i was in singapore for 5 days and had done a lot of research about restaurants i wanted to visit, this one kept coming up as highly rated by various food bloggers in the region. we hadnt booked but thought we would wing it as it was midweek. i arrived first and went to enter the restaurant to see if we could have booking for later i was headed off at the pass by a very brusque young waitress coming down the stairs from the bar, she assumed i was lost and tried to usher me upstairs to the bar , i explained i wanted to book a table... she opened the door and proceeded to have a conversation in chinese with two of the waiting staff in the restaurant. the answer was that they were fully booked. so i asked about the following evening .. everyone looks cross eyed at me .. the waitress then said she'd find out and come find me in the bar upstairs to let me know. needles to say she never appeared. i went for a drink upstairs .. i had to force them to give me a table on the non smoking harbour view side ( they obviously keep these tables for the city slickers buying champagne).. my friend arrived a half hour later ... as a test i asked her to go down and see if she could get a table ..( she was dressed in a suit with a mulberry handbag) .. hey presto we get a table and they are not full at all ... this might all have been OK if the food was any good ... it was all distinctly average apart from the first course which was a jardiniere salad plate.. which was actually very good and beautifully presented. theres just something a bit "off " about this place ... it does not live up to the hype or the web site pictures. and the service is pretty poor throughout. i certainly would not go back or recommend to others. its a shame as its a beautiful building and a superb location. I would say the bar upstairs though, has amazing panoramic views, and they were doing happy hour on some of the drinks. so would recommend a trip up there if you were in the area for a drink

The Prelude rooftop bar is on top of the Boathouse. It offers an excellent view to Marina Bay Sands, Singapore river, the Flyer and the CBD. However, the service is very lousy and so are the drinks. Service staff appears to be very unmotivated and not attentive. The drinks, in particular the cocktails are simply disappointing. What a waste, it could be a great location.

Food is great. From appetizer to main dish to dessert. Ambience is great. It felt like being in Europe, perhaps in a nice restaurant in Paris.The service level of the staff was surprisingly good. Attentive. While you knew that they were giving you their undivided attention, serving you, but you did not feel intimidated by them at all.When serving dessert, they even suggested to us that, we could move on to the rooftop, to experience a different ambience, and enjoy Singapore scenery. Definitely a restaurant that we will return again

The menu offers a Sunset Special happy hour - pints of beer at half pint prices. The waiter who took our order also told us we could get 1 for 1 on bottled beers before 8pm. We ordered one round of beers. Neither promotion was reflected in the bill. When we enquired, we were told that the promotion did not apply on a Friday. There is no mention of this restriction on the menu and the promotion on the bottles was offered to us as we were placing our order. The staff were very reluctant to give us the promotion. We overheard other groups complaining about the same thing as we left.I cannot tolerate places which appear routinely to rip off their clientel. This appears to be one of them. Despite the good views from the roof, I will not recommend this bar and will not return
