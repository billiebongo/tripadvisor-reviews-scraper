A stroll in the botanical garden lighten and refresh us for a fine dining experience. The post dining walk gazing the star completes the menu.

This place really lives up to its reputation. Great food, ambiance and service. The ingredients are familiar but prepared differently. It gives way to familiar flavors but giving access to deeper and more complex flavors you wouldn't normally get from those ingredients.
5
This is a really magic place within the botanical garden. Very nice restaurant and the food was outstanding. How phantastic can vegetable foodbe!
5
Server was very attentive. Food was delicious, great wines though price is on the high side. Perfect for those who love nature.
4
Food was great. However, the tables were seated quite near each other, and there was lack of privacy. Ingredients were great, but I expected more from the food.

Had the most wonderful birthday meal here with my husband. Restaurant was cosy and relaxed with a buzzing atmosphere befit for a Friday night.Chose the vegetarian tasting menu which was just delicious - the ode to an onion(!) course being particularly amazing! Our friendly waiter was careful to explain every dish and service was attentive whilst never feeling intrusive.Both the wine and food were delicious, the service was faultless, the surroundings beautiful - we cant wait to come back

I chose to give my girlfriend a night at a Michelin restaurant for her birthday.. in this case, in Singapore! I had carefully chosen Corner House as it is placed in the beautiful Singapore botanic gardens and especially to be seated in the "Whispering Corner" as this is more private than the rest of the scenic restaurant. I had chosen for us beforehand the Degustation Menu and we were never dispappointed that I did just that. The menu was a tour de force of flavours with a huge range. The wine pairing was excellent however on the pricey side of things. As the glasses poured were quite small, I asked for a bit more two times. Only one of these times, the waiters charged me extra. We had a fantastic experience with amazing flavor, a truly attentive and service minded staff and.. to end the night going out in the dark gardens was just perfect
5
WOW, WOW, WOW!!!!Please go to the Corner House to experience a sublime culinary experience. Let's start with the setting; the old colonial house is small but charming. We were there at night so we could not enjoy views of the gardens. The service was good but they could turn it up a notch. We decided to opt for the vegetarian menu (and believe me, both my husband and I are serious carnivores! But we had Pekin Duck at lunch with our dim sum and were sort of maxed out on meat, plus we were intrigued by an all vegetarian menu). We also went with their wine pairing option. We were so happy we did.The dishes started to come out. The food presentation was ART!! The flavors, the taste of the food were just amazing. Our taste buds and our sense just relished each and every bite. We both felt that our dinner at The Corner House was one of our best meals ever. We would definitely come back on our next trip to Singapore

Generally excellent food but.....1. For the first time ever, I sent back a dish in a Michelin starred restaurant - Iberico pork that hadn't been properly trimmed, leaving tough fascia attached to the meat. Was replaced but not without having to insist the toughness wasn't due to the cooking style (by the way, do any chefs try to make Iberico pork tough?!)2. Service efficient but cold3. Wine prices exorbitant, but perhaps that's standard for Singapore. SGD 38 for a glass of German riesling.4. The policy of upgrading customers to a balcony table overlooking the Botanical Gardens if they spend >SGD 300 per head seems a litle tacky.Amuse bouche, scallop and oyster starter and crispy cod were creative and delicious. Fantastic shortbread in "Kaya toast" dessert.Overall an enjoyable evening but I won't be rushing back
5
It was my second visit this time. Cozy environment accompanied with friendly service. The buggy only brings you from the visitor's centre to the restaurant which is faster if you walk. So if you are stranded at another exit, you have to walk all the way to the restaurant.Food was not as great as my first visit.
5
The kava toast inspired dessert was freaking amazing. I don’t eat red meat but when my husband orders Wagu I always give it a try regardless. As always it was like butter smooth and delicious. My fish was great.
4
The presentation of the food just shows how much of effort the Chef and his team has put in. Most important part is each single dish was palatable.
5
Food was very well prepared & an experience to be savoured.Service was very good also.The surroundings are the Singapore Botanical Gardens-very nice!
4
Great food and unique experience for family lunch. Kids love the botanic gardens surroundings. Good location and setting.
5
We visited for Saturday brunch and I loved the atmosphere with the colonial building set in the centre of the botanical gardens, looking out onto the rainforest trees we saw a hornbill right outside the window! The decor is lovely and they were playing jazz, very relaxing but the staff were very attentive. The food we had was great, amazing breads and pastries with flavoured butters, then a very generous sharing course with many different dishes like soft shell crab, ceviche, beetroot and goats cheese etc, then a beautifully presented poached egg with smoked salmon. The tiramisu was also lovely, and my boyfriend said the prawn was the best he's had! Then we walked it all off in the gardens, a lovely way to spend a Saturday
4
We booked the restaurant 1 week in advance for my sister’s birthday. Seated at the corner with very nice view of tropical trees. Waiters were very attentive and polite, explained each course of the meal in detail. Food was good except that there was no complimentary tea or coffee with the desert hence we had to order them separatelyOverall this place is perfect for couples for date, and celebrations
5
Amazing food, amazing venue, amazing wines. Just celebrated my birthday at Corner House. It was perfect. Dishes were well thought about and each mouthful was just delightful on the palate. They have a very knowledgeable sommelier Freddy who is more than happy to take you through an extremely comprehensive list of top top wines. Thanks Chef Jason and all at Corner House
5
This is famous fine dinning restaurant in Singapore located at botanical garden. The view should be very lovely in day time and their lunch.menu is quite good value therefore they always fully booked in lunch time especially weekend, but we wanna try more dishes so came here for dinner.Food was amazing ,the taste was well balanced and creative. Especially the first few amuse bouches like the entree truffle ball ,a leaf taste like oyster and the cucumber jelly ball busted in mouth were surprising. Following courses also amazing. We have tried few fine dinning restaurant in Singapore this is my favourite one
5
I visited Corner House for a birthday dinner recently. The location was nice and quiet, hidden in Botanic Gardens. The restaurant ambiance was cozy which i really liked. The service by corner house staff was impeccable and we really enjoyed every dish in the 5 and 6 course menu which we ordered. The amuse bouches were really interesting and i enjoyed each and everyone of them. My favourite would have to be the hokkaido scallop with oysters without a doubt. Loved the combination of fresh seafood with the sauce that accompanied the dish. Our menu included the A4 Toriyama beef as well which i ordered in medium rare. It was cooked to perfection (the melt in your mouth kind). We did not order any wine because it was a tad bit pricey. Overall a wonderful experience at the corner house. From the service to the food. The chef's passion for food was presented in each and every dish. Everything was excellent and it was a really enjoyable night for us. Definitely somewhere i will return for a second visit. (Highly recommended for special occasions)(Opt for whispering corner if you want a more private and quiet dining experience
4
Came here for dinner and got the full tasting course with wine pairing. The wine was paired beautifully and they really choose quality wines. They served 3 sets of amuse bouches which were perhaps the stars of the whole night. The chef really showed off his passion for the garden with great skill and flavor that would make anyone who snubs off veggies eat their words (or veggies). The only reason it doesn’t get 5 stars is because it felt like proteins didn’t get quite the same love as the veggies. We were served A5 wagyu- an insanely good cut of beef and it carried no flavor. It was incredible texture but no salt or any herbs/spices to taste the meat. Really happy with the meal, the ambiance, the staff, the location (the botanical gardens). But if you have a Michelin Star and charge Michelin Star prices - I gotta get picky.
5
The corner house wait staff was awesome. The chef was accommodated to my dairy allergies and the food was more than perfect. Will definitely return for a second visit.

Had the gastronomic course. Fish with crispy scales was good. Organic lamb was not available, so replaced with iberico which was acceptable but lamb might have been better
1
Nice enough food and decent service but honestly the world class prices you pay?! Not even close. Don't even consider this place.
4
I love quaint cozy restaurants like this. A number of tables were celebrating birthdays or family meals. Ordered the 4 course business luncheon with wagyu beef. Loved the presentation of the dishes which were with flowers or leaves that fits the beautiful place it is located. The foie gras was delicious and very well balanced with grapefruit. Ordered the wagyu in medium rare and it was perfect. The wine list was super expensive as mentioned by other reviewers. Usually i will have 2-3 glasses of wine or drinks but at this restaurant, the prices were too shockingly expensive. Suggest for the restaurant to carry more house wine of moderate pricing. Highly recommend for special occasions

This is the perfect garden setting for a leisurely afternoon lunch - the restaurant is in a beautifully conserved black and white colonial bungalow, with the dining area on its upper floor; giving you splendid overviews of the Botanic Gardens - of native birds looking back at you while perched on nearby tree branches and of native monitor lizards lazing under the palm trees.We had the restaurant's business lunch; opting for its 3 course offering of starter, mains and dessert. We will definitely return for a 4 course option of both starters and both desserts! The foie gras almost melts in your mouth and the scallops' flavours intensifies with each bite. As for desserts, my childhood memories of mentally tussling over whether to spread kaya or peanut butter on toast is put to rest by the chef's beautiful pairing of both flavours in one. A perfect feat which he repeats with inspirations of meringue, strawberries and lychees in the other.We discovered in his mains that he does vegetables to perfection too - the cauliflower slices and burnt broccoli were absolutely divine. We will return for dinner as he offers a vegetarian degustation menu too! The wait staff are excellent. When my husband complimented the restaurant for offering the white wine we were drinking in its menu, he'd replied, "You chose it, sir. You must know it well." When told that my hubby didn't, he'd graciously said 'thank you'
5
Great food and plating, nice ambience and a lot attention to detail. We didn't tell them whose birthday it was, but the staff figured from our conversation that it was a friend's bday and arrange for his desert to have "Happy Bday" text on the plate. Very good initiative. We enjoyed ourselves a lot.
5
Had a 3 course brunch meal. The service was good, food was exceptional. Highlight was the dessert, memory from Chef Jason's childhood. It really was a trip down memory lane, the pandan softserve, caramel biscuits, everything, felt like the childhood ice-cream truck on a plate.Well done. Thank you
5
I am proud of Chef Jason and his team for such a wonderful dining experience. The food was so good especially "My Childhood Memory" dessert. I will give 11 out of 10 stars if I can. Do support our local chef who hails from humble beginnings. A very well deserved 1 Michelin star restaurant with a cozy setting
5
My wife and I dined here a couple of nights ago and as an overall dining experience it was almost flawless.I had the Degustation menu and my wife (who’s vegetarian) had the Botanica menu. We’ve been to a number of Michelin Star restaurants and this has been the best for making my wives vegetarian menu and experience the centre of attention! Massive thanks for doing this as often it’s the poorer cousin menu for her.Service was excellent and the food was just stunning and a brilliant experience not just about eating the food, it was actually fun to eat some of the course.The chefs signature dish (all about the onion!) was one of my wife’s course and waow, it was nothing short of incredible!The one and only downside was that one of the two petit fours were burnt on the bottom, which frustratingly was the last thing we ate. A small blemish on an otherwise excellent dining experience

The Corner House benefits from a really magnificent setting, tucked in the Singapore Botanic garden. It’s a quaint colonial black and white with history, and has been renovated - so is both modern and in keeping with the setting. Top marks for preserving the history and delivering a wonderful ambiance. Service: I realise that it is part of the economics of modern F&B to conform your reservation - but being called as a reminder is generally annoying. Corner House sent me a Text message - it was unobtrusive and didn’t interrupt my day or meetings - well done. At the restaurant, they remembered the event we were celebrating and always addressed us by name, without it being creepy. Again, well doneMenu: some night say, the chef is trying too hard. I’d say that I don’t want the chef to do anything but try hard - inventive and nice flavours. Some worked better than others, but heck - were out for a night of celebration. Let’s try different things. Pricing: As expected, this is a top dollar venue, but the staff and chef has earned this. No complaints. The negative: my wife had terrible bout of food poisoning. This can happen anywhere - although I was unaffected, I had changed my raw dish for a cooked one. So I’d say... I like like the restaurant a great deal, but food poisoning is not only terrible - but it says something negative about quality control. So, I’m torn between rating corner house 2 or 5. Maybe it’s best to say, avoid the raw dishes - but still go. If the management respond positively, take this as a good sign and assume 5. If there’s no or s negative response. Take it as a zero, and treat with caution.
5
Environment Good, Food Delicious and serve in a Delicate way. Good Wine list. Excellent Service carry out by all the staff there.
5
I was awed by the presentation of the dishes as well as the unique, fresh and flavorful taste. The dining experience totally exceeded our expectations!
5
My 2nd there. The food is excellent. Exquisite taste. This time, I brought 2 overseas guests there. I had the best sangria. however, they did not offer me the gift of madelines even through the bill from the 4 of us was close to $800!
5
Read and heard much about this restaurant, finally tried it! Delighted that the food was better than expected ( as sometimes some Michele starred meal may not turn out to be as good ). Like the exquisite taste and the fine presentation of the food.
4
Food is excellent- very inventive, high quality and tasty. Location absolutely beautiful. Prohibitively expensive

We were having a Dinner to celebrate my sonâ€™s 34th Birthday in Private Room. As it was on Friday, the minimum was SGD2,100.00. As far as the food is concerned, the quality n taste is good, but I find that the price of wine is expensive.
5
Really enjoyed our lunch. Nice ambience, delicious n high quality food with creative presentation, excellent service mainly Easee & Freddy. Chef Jason is a real talent n very humble. Champagne & wine range too over rated. If you lower your price range, you might even more order by the bottle. OverAll experience - impressed!

We had several meal let-downs during our recent stay in Singapore, but it turns out that we left the best place for our last meal.Corner House is excellent. Nothing less.For years, I have told my friends, or anyone who chooses to listen to me, that my best meals ever were generally in the south of France, in particular La Bastide St Antoine (before I was a TA contributor) as well as Le Moulin de Mougins and also in Singapore at St Pierre, not to mention a few good places in Melbourne and also in Hong Kong.Corner House is up there, right at the pointy end of my food experiences. Full credit to Chef and staff - great food, great service. Dishes resembled works of art, tastes juxtaposed. And the set lunch menu is totally affordable when you see what you get for your money. I hardly drank as the wine list is so expensive - the only downside.Corner House really is a must-do experience. I am sure that we will return
5
So far the most memorable dining experience I had in SG. Situated in beautiful Botanic Garden, our expectation was 120 percent filled up! The food was exceptionally tasty and made u just want more. The waters were all professional and nice, service they provided let us feel so welcomed. Recommend to all of u
5
Everything the Webpage tells is right: Enchanting on many fronts, CORNER HOUSE celebrates a unique and colourful human being, it evokes the romance of a special historical location, it thrills with superb gastronomy and marks a return to grace and hospitality that will be cherished and remembered
5
Great food, great value for money. Service was spot on. Will definitely come back and recommend. Deserving of its Michelin star.
5
Good is really great! Place cosy for romantic night out!! Different menu offering a great dining experience ! Great wine selections too!! Kudo to the chef and service team!!

Michelin stars can be a good thing and a bad thing: good because it raises awareness and bad because it raises expectations. So when the food is average, and the ambience isn't particularly spectacular, high expectations are disappointed. We had the 3 course business lunch. Let's start with the service. The waiters were very friendly and pleasant, if only we could get their attention. The food was well decorated, but tasted so ordinary. The restaurant is in a beautiful house, but not well maintained: Dirty and stained carpets. One more thing, this isn't a place for celebrating special occasions. I read in one of the previous reviews that they only give a plate with 'Happy birthday' written on it. In our case it was worse: they didn't even acknowledge my wife's birthday although they were aware of it. If you want to go somewhere for a tasty and filling meal, this isn't the place. If you want to go somewhere to celebrate a special occasion, this isn't the place. If you want to dine in a gorgeous place surrounded by lush greenery, well, this is the place. However there are a few other restaurants in the vicinity that you can do that- and which have better food and as a bonus, better prices.

I heard about Chef Jason Tan and his restaurant Corner House from a Channel News Asia feature on distinguished local chefs and thought it imperative to visit on this trip back to Singapore. I was not disappointed.Between my parents and me, we tasted everything on the Business Luncheon set - it was hard to pick our favourite dish! Every dish was perfectly executed and beautifully presented; the waiters polite and friendly; and all of this set in the naturally luxuriant surroundings of Singapore Botanic Gardens. Cannot recommend this more
5
My husband and I celebrated our 13th dating anniversary/6th wedding anniversary at Corner House. Food was delicious and crafted with love, setting was cosy and romantic, and service was impeccable. Loved the chocolate Madeleines from them too, absolutely yummy! Keep up the good work, will let the pictures do the talking
5
Visited here while at the GP and went for lunch with wine pairing. Very short, sweet and simple - fantastic. Good value and amazing wine pairing. Service was impeccable. Thanks guys for an outstanding experience. Just bear in mind it's around a sgd20 ride out of town.
5
Corner House is a wonderful black and white tucked away in the Botanic Gardens. We celebrated our anniversary here. The food prepared was sumptuous to the eyes and the mouth. Simple vegetables and fruit, when prepared with skill and finesse, were the stars of the night, especially the onion.
5
This is a place out of this world. We went there to celebrate a very special day. The setting and ambience are so exceptional, certainly one of the most lovely restaurants in the city. The food â€“ you have to try it! Yes, it is expensive but you know this before
5
A hidden gem on the grounds of the UNESCO protected gardens. Named after the botanist who stayed there with his family as he worked on plants and fungi with his pet monkey. Delightful food with well-controlled flavours, thoughtfully prepared by someone with a sensational palate, and every plate so beautifully presented.Try the lunch menu for a smaller dent to the wallet, and enjoy the verdant surroundings in the sunshine
2
I went there to celebrate my wife's birthday and the food was average and the service was terrible. I was very disappointed that they did not even offer a piece of cake for my wife to blow the candle from and instead just wrote happy birthday on a plate and stuck a candle on it. I am very disappointed and much prefer the old Les Amis restaurant, Au Jardin. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone because at that price there are many better restaurants in Singapore (ie Andre, Odette, Jaan, Tippling Club, Les Amis, etc). On that day there was also a family with two boys who were speaking very loud so it was not a great atmosphere since the tables are quite close to each other
4
Just a lovely, intimate and unique setting. A beautiful house set in an immaculate tropical garden. The food was refined and creative and the staff were friendly and attentive. A little on the pricey end so save this for a special occasion.
5
Have a very nice day there with my mum!
Impressed by the nice view, the wonderful food (healthy and tasty) and excellent service.
4
Nice ambience with great food, especially the beef!
Desserts were uniquely prepared & yummy!
Serive staff were also very attentive.
5
Nestled in the Botanical garden (so not so easy to find ) the place is just divine from the set up. Large big windows allow you to eat and enjoy the lush beauty of the botanical garden . For lunch you have two choices: either a business lunch (3 or 4 course) and a special tasting set (128.- pp). We choose the business lunch and the food was delicious . The foie gras was absolutely wonderful (only at lunch available) as well as the wagyu beef. I had his kaya toast for desert. Highly recommendable.Service was good but have to say could have been a notch better as they were a bit sloppy w serving the bread. ( don't like when I get first to a restaurant but then the next table which came later is served first!) . But it didn't change my judgment about the setting and the divine food.
5
This is a super location for a restaurant....Difficult to find, but once there it's a delight.Well appointed.Good Service.Excellent food.Not cheap.But highly recommended.If you like good food, well served, in a great location, this is the place to go to.250 sg for a per person meal. Tax and Water included.Bhagwan

A classy dinner on Sunday night for three people. Corner House provides a unique dining experience in the quiet, peaceful and popular botanic gardens. After alighting from the taxi and a short 75m walk the restaurant is upstairs in the Corner House, named after British man, once resident in the gardens. Tables are well placed and allow for a private dining experience. The staff were knowledgable, well dressed and very efficient. The set menu provided visual delights that were beautifully presented on interesting plates, bowls etc. The courses were well spaced through the evening and the table setting simple but elegant with top quality tableware. The wine list was very good as was the coffee. This is a top quality restaurant
5
A stunningly historic setting in the Botanic Gardens. The immaculate setting is matched by heart warming and immaculate dishes that surprise the senses and bring a smile to your face. The Amuse-Bouche did exactly that - and started the evening off on a happy note - relax into the evening and you'll be treated to a superb experience. Lovely staff too.
5
My friends took me to Corner House for my birthday recently and it was such a lovely treat. Everything was perfect from start to finish. Food was excellent, the restaurant deserves it's one Michelin star. The setting in Botanic Gardens makes the restaurant extra special. It's worth a visit. With well priced Business lunches daily, you will be surprised that you won't break the bank dining there.

Atmosphere was wonderful. The large glass window give it a sense of space. Food was mostly fantastic. Had the 5 course meal. From the amuse bouche was interesting. Loved the chia seed jelly and The fish cracker for the textures. The scallops were a winner too. Liked the oysters but felt so sayang to cook them. pork jowl really raised the monk fish but i felt the beef was nothing spectacular, albeit well cooked and presented. Dessert was interesting and I personally like the flavours in them. Service was the main issue. While the servers were generally friendly, it felt more and more rushed as we got to the last two courses. What really was a turn off was the head waiter/manager who we overheard telling the wait staff somewhat to pass us the bill (not in those exact words) and eventually coming up himself to hand it to us while we were still eating. What made me annoyed was that another table was also still there and only finishing up drinks yet they were left alone until they called for the bill. This would be unacceptable in other Michelin restaurants in my opinion. Nonetheless, fantastic job by chef Jason Tan and the kitchen staff

First impressions of Corner House are great. An old black-and-white house in a hidden corner of the Botanic Gardens off Bukit Timah Rd, with a jazzy black-and-white smart interior on the upstairs veranda, and appropriately old-time jazz music tinkling in the background. Surrounded by leafy palm trees, it feels lush, secluded and indulgently homely tropical.We went for Sunday brunch. I was slightly intimidated by the five course menu of croissants, assorted appetisers such as kingfish and foie gras, eggs, cod or beef, and chocolate mango dessert, but the portions aren't big and the amount is comfortable. The food is generally excellent - my friend particularly liked the egg, bacon and pumpkin. Why a missing point? Imported cod is used in Singapore as a lazy way of making a fish dish sound luxurious, and mine was a bit watery and tasteless. The service was at times perfunctory, huffy and lacking finesse. In short, Corner House is good but not great. What I'll most remember is the leafy garden setting
5
I'd say this is one of the better one-starred restaurants in Singapore. Great venue, and they offer reasonably priced lunch sets.
5
It was great food, good service and good location!! We went for our anniversary celebration and felt pampered... just the way we wanted to be felt.
4
corner house is good in service but not excellent compare to some other high class restaurants won't visit again
5
One of my favouritr places. Gastro botanica is an apt description. Fine cuisine without being overly stuffy, service is excellent. Sensitive without being overbearing.
2
The food is completely over rated. There were a few morsels of it on the plate and after paying a hefty price, walked out still very hungry. The main course had literally 3 sticks of asparagus and 3 glazed baby tomatoes. And the staff had a sneering, condescending look when I asked if they could increase the portions
5
Dining at Corner House can be defined as a Singaporean experience. The reasons: this restaurant is located in the heart of Singapore's World heritage site, and the chef is a local one who incorporates local influences into European cuisine. Now it is obvious how the title of this post came about.Location wise, this restaurant takes the top spot in Singapore. On our way from the car park to the restaurant nested in lush greenery, we are constantly surrounded by beautiful tropical flora of different kinds. I consider the journey through Botanic Gardens part of the dining experience, and this is a good start. The entire restaurant is seeped in Old World charm, from the exterior, the staircase to the casement windows. And when stepping into veranda, we are treated to the amazing panoramic view of the dense greenery surrounding the restaurant. In Singapore, the concrete jungle, the sight of such verdure is so refreshing and awe-inspiring. In fact, no fanciest building can compete with the beauty of nature when it comes to the feast for eyes.Basking in such wonderful ambience, we find it so easy to truly indulge in the goodness of the freshly baked, warm croissants at the start of the brunch. The numerous thin layers of dough is so crispy, and every bite yields the homely aroma of homemade bread. We would prefer to have French butter to go with these croissants, but the homemade jam, which is not too sweet, does very well to complement the bread. The molten chocolate in the chocolate croissant makes the bread taste so heavenly with its rich flavours of cocoa butter and toasted nuts. While the croissants are absolutely delightful to tuck into, the French loaf is the weak link since it is too rock hard, making it a challenge to finish the bread.Though we have no time on dwell on that loaf when the mouth-watering assiette of appetizers are served. I love how pine nuts, a scattering of Parmesan cheese, a splash of chef's concocted light sauce and crisp, fresh vegetables are combined to create a salad that tastes like no other salads and features multitude of flavours. The little balls of fish coated in batter is reminiscent of the fish n chips Singaporeans are familiar with. But of course, the ones here are far more flavourful and have better texture due to use of choice fish and soufflé-like batter. The huge slab of foie gras is incredibly creamy, yet not oily, and the grapefruit served with them adds that bit of subtle zest and a lace of bitterness to balance the creaminess. The generous serving of duck rillette is packed with intense flavours, and the texture is very smooth. This is so good that it can be eaten on its own or used as spread.62 degrees farm egg is toned down in taste with butter squash, and sprinkles of truffle, bacon and wild rice—all of which are earthy in taste. It is like the comfort food that one will like though not exactly outstanding. Egg Benedict is the more flamboyant version of the egg dishes. The tangy Vin Jaune hollandaise sauce, smoked salmon and spoonfuls of tobiko—flying fish roe introduced strong and exciting flavours to the beautifully set egg that holds a runny yolk. One ingredient I must call out is the rice cracker. The wholesome aroma of the rice is so pronounced in the cracker. Plus the crispy texture, this is one excellent artisanal cracker that I cannot get enough of.The main course continues the great momentum the croissants, appetizers and eggs have generated. The chef knows how to prepare the fishes to eliminate the fishy smell while bringing out inherent flavours of the sea sealed in the pliable, creamy flesh of Atlantic cod. The lightly seared surface of the fish retains the soft texture of the fish and adds a hint of the aroma of grilled seafood. And paired with the salty squid ink, this is fish very well-done.The Obsiblue prawn that goes with the cod deserves a paragraph dedicated to it. This is most probably the best prawn I ever have. Partially cooked, the flesh of the prawn has the perfect firmness—firm enough for a good bite while soft enough for the flavours to be released soon after tucking into it. It is absolutely saturated with the sweet flavours of the ocean, nuts, butter and brine. No other prawn can come close, for now.This restaurant exceeds my expectations by getting the desserts absolutely right also. Speculoos not only looks pretty, it tastes delightful also. The milk roll is blissfully creamy, completed with nuanced fragrance of vanilla. And it goes very well with the snack bar-like chocolate. The dollops of milk chocolate cream and caramel all taste good on their own and do great when savoured together. And the mandarin orange sorbet refreshes the palate in between bites of the rich chocolate. My interpretation of Kaya Toast is specially prepared for my guy since he has intolerance towards peanuts, and I am glad to be able to get a taste of this very Singaporean dessert, dished out in European style. The gula melaka foam, the well-set cylindrical cream of coconut and pandan simply burst with strong nonya flavours. As a fan of nonya cakes—I love the milky, nutty taste of coconut, the sweet smell of pandan and the unique smoky caramel flavour of gula melaka—this dessert definitely get the thumbs up from me. The best part is every component of the dessert is added in moderation instead of overwhelming the senses with truckloads of them, so we can appreciate every bit of it. The pineapple sorbet is like the mandarin orange sorbet, refreshing and mildly tangy—one of the few sorbets that impress us.Service is wonderful because the friendly, professional staffs really make the effort to accommodate to our mild dietary restrictions. If I need to nit-pick, it will be the lack of warmth in the demeanour of the manager.While I have raved about the setting of the restaurant, I do find that my dining experience is somewhat marred by a group of loud ladies at the table beside us. Due to the layout of the place, we feel like their voices are being blasted into our ears. I can catch every single detail of their conversation, and frankly speaking, I do not wish to know at all. On the hindsight, we should have requested to change tables. So for a quiet and enjoyable experience, which you wish to indulge with that special someone, opt for the private room. Do take note that the charges are higher. Alternatively, hope for the best.Despite this gripe, I still love this place. The food aims to please instead of dazzling one's taste buds. I do find that the chef tends to play it safe when it comes to experimenting with different tastes. What I appreciate about this place is that the standard across the different courses is consistent. I love to go back again to enjoy the food and scenery

We had lunch and my husband's lunch was very good. Dessert especially was fantastic for him. We had a table without a view, although most tables have lovely views. The other tables seemed to get better service, for example petite fours with their coffee, while nothing for our table.I have food intolerances and understand this limits my options. The waiter was good about explaining the dishes to help me choose and brought gluten free bread with olive oil instead of bread and butter (although I was given a lecture about how my food intolerances made it difficult for the chef, even though I try to be as polite and flexible as I can with my medical problems).Unfortunately I was served food with dairy in it and suffered gastrointestinal upset and pain. Not what you want before an international flight. Also my dessert came out with meringue despite the waiter understanding my egg intolerance.It is also up a steep set of stairs, there's no lift (in case this information is useful for people).For me, one star. My husband's food, four stars. I can't recommend it if you have allergies or medical food requirements

Celebrated our 25th Wedding Anniversary here, super food, great taste and wonder ambiance. We were seated at the Whispering Corner, great spot for fine dining and soft light to enhance the whole dining experience.Very friendly service staffs, all well trained. Must and will come back for the Sunday Brunch or weekday lunches :
5
We arrived early for dinner (6:30pm) and enjoyed the absolutely fantastic setting while it was still light. Service was excellent and the food had many subtle changes of flavours in each mouthful. We ate the botanica menu and I went with the wine suggestions. While the restaurant is expensive it is one of the best meals I have ever had. Thank you for a wonderful evening and the friendly service of our waiter.

Let me start by saying that the ambience (location, building and decoration) is very charming and a feast for the eye. It all enhances the experience. We are real foodies and love the high quality culinary experiences; so we are quite critical, but I have to be honest.. Dishes were almost all amazing, taste wonderful and some true taste explosion in the mouth. We had two time the botanica menu and two times the menu degustation. The onion dish was amazing and truly original with the little explanatory booklet. The only part that was less good was the onion crisp in our case. It was not crispy anymore. The tomato dish was FANTASTIC; because it is 'just' tomatoes your expectations are not that high but the chef has made sure that every bite is a true sensation. So big thumbs up for the chef because most dishes were outstanding (like beef, chicken, stracciatella, desserts, etc). BUT the service was a big dissapointment for us. It started already by really rushing us and pushing us to order asap (we had a reservation at 8:30 and clearly they wanted to go home on time...). The courses came in huge pace, with barely enough time to breathe between them. Also when one of the guest on a table (almost) finished her/ his plate, they would clear it, so the rest of the tabel felt even more rushed; let alone the last one that still had to finish... Constantly there were four waiting staff tiptoeing around and standing next to our table constantly looking if you were finished but also giggling and chit chatting quite loudly. This was quite rude and intrusive to be honest. One of us had to go to the toilet right after finishing her dish and when she came back there was already the mouth cleanser on the table for 5 minutes and the effect was gone (foam..?) and everybody was waiting for her with 'spoiled' dishes. If a guest goes to the toilet one should not serve out the dishes but wait till the guest has returned. Same as clearing the dishes; wait until all guests have finished before clearing the table. Two other things to share: we ordered a bottle of wine and after more than 12 minutes they came back that is was no longer available, another guest had just ordered it (...? do they have only one?). In the end they asked our 'onion' booklet back and asked for our name, the chef would sign it or something, but we never got it back, so kind of a disappointment. I really hope they will take the service up to the right level again, it must have been at a good level otherwise you do not get a Michelin star. But for the food and the ambience, I would most definitely come back

Very accomplished, mostly French cooking. Worthy of 1 star. Quite expensive though (dinner here cost more than at Andre but not quite in that league yet) and service, whilst professional, lacked enthusiasm.
4
Set in a lush greenery botanic garden. A Michelin ⭐️Restaurant. Nice ambience, great food and service. Great for a romantic evening with love one.
3
We found our experience at Corner House disappointing compared to other Michelin Starred restaurants. The service staff did not engage with us as diners, and the air conditioning was so cold, we were pleased to leave.
5
This Restaurant has an appealing address of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, & it occupies a former colonial house, so this makes a dramatic impression with the natural surroundings against its white-color architecture. Staff are of high quality & service is impeccable all round. There are 4 sets of menu to choose from, & they r flexible with their dishes within. The Restaurant has two floors but do make an effort to have an advance booking in order to secure a table on the upper floor which has a stunning unobstructed view to the Garden ( see pix provided)
4
Yummy food and great experience at Corner House when we decided to take our visitors from UK for lunch. The day could have been perfect if weather was kinder (it was pouring so we had to abandon our initial plan to burn off the calories at the garden)
3
We sent back our two monkfish dishes which had strong fishy smell. After perfunctionary questions by the wait staff who took the dishes back, the degustation menu continued without a pause. It was as though nothing had happened. From the start to end of dinner, the feeling we received was that everyone was just doing a job. We couldnt feel we were in a Michelin restaurant where there is a strive for excellence in cuisine and experience for the guests
4
Celebrated our Anniversary Dinner @ Corner House for a 8.30 pm seating. Corner House is really two minutes walk from the Nassim Gate entrance. The walk, the still, the quietness and the darkness of the Gardens at night prepares your senses for the dinner experience.My wife had the Menu Botanica and I had the Menu Degustation, both were 5 courses with an optional wine pairing. I threw the Chef a request at the last minute when I requested for the main entrÃ©e to be replaced with the pasta dish from the Botanica menu (I don't eat red meat). My request was accepted after further checks on my dietary restrictions.Wine selection was very impressive. We opted for a bottle of 2002 Chateau L'Hermitage from the End Bin List which was at the tail end of its potential development. Good value for a wine with rich taste and long finish. Food service, presentation, attention to details were spot on. I will let you form your own opinion of the food but the standout was the Oignon doux des Cevennes from the Botanica menu. Thankfully my wife was willing to share this wondering interpretation and expression for the joy of onion with me. :)Dessert was decadent paired with black coffee. Chef's interpretation of his favorite childhood food memory was a solid standout
3
Celebrated my birthday dinner with wife on 12 July 2017. We had a mix of the vegetarian (the chef's signature onion dish was included here that's why we chose it) and the next set which had the Japanese wagyu included. The dishes are very well prepared. But not many are mind blowing memorable. I can safely say the onion dish is fantastic, as was the fois gras bon bon (one bon bon as amuse bouche). The rest were well prepared, well presented and pleasant. Not mind blowing. IMHO, this 1 star is not better than many other 1 stars that we've been (Terra before it lost the star was far more interesting and value for money). But to be honest, it's not the worst. It's better than Jules Verne at the Eiffel Tower. But I can't provide many more examples. Oh, it's better than the 2 star Shishen Honten - but the price of Honten is way lower than Corner House. The wine list (I think it's from Wine Culture) is great but very over priced. We chose a carafe of white and red (Pouilly Fume and Chave northern Rhone). Supposed to be 500 ml each - 1 L total. It was not. That I'm able to write this after dinner (wife didn't drink much) is testament that it was not... at most 750ml, if at all. Chef is very talented. No doubt! But the amount of food and spectacularity of the food versus the cost is a bit disappointing - it's not value for money. From a service perspective, the staff are too anxious to clear the dishes. It's 2 people eating each course. Let both finish before clearing. But no, if one person finished first, then that person would be cleared while the other was still eating... Also, the crumbs on the table should have been cleared at the end of each course before the next course came (or is that only reserved for 2 or 3 star restaurants)?I would recommend at least one try. But it's not a repeat for me (unless someone else is buying, especially some of the spectacular wines on the list)

Visited on a weekend for dinner. Dinner is served as degustation sets and with optional wine pairing. We decided not to go for the wine pairing but we had the sommelier help us with wine selections by the glass and half-bottle.The food is great and is often infused with a local slant such as the chef's interpretation of an oyster omelette. Service is attentive but not intrusive and the food serving is well-paced. We also found the ambience to be inviting and unpretentious.Overall the food is impressive especially the Toriyama A4 wagyu and the desserts. We were not impressed with the Monkfish and the excessive use of foams instead of a traditional sauce. That being said, it didn't mar our experience.I would say that the tables are a little close together and coupled with the wooden flooring, it can get a little noisy
5
I called on a Thursday evening to reserve a table for four for Saturday lunch. I was happy that there was availability in the main dining area. It would be nice to be seated in the air-conditioned veranda but I guess that such reservation must be made earlier.We arrived at 12 pm and were led to our table by polite staff. There were not many diners at that time. We went for the three course set lunch which has a choice of two appetizers, three mains and three dessert. The appetizers are raw fish or foie gras. The mains are iberico pork, toothfish or beef. After a while, we were served two pieces of warm bread with very crispy crust which tasted very good with the french butter. The raw fish appetizer was good too. The toothfish main was the best among the three. I was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful presentation of the desserts. Each dessert enables one to enjoy a variety of taste and texture. The diners starting to stream in after 12.45 pm.We were thankful that we came earlier so that we did not need to wait too long for our food. We enjoyed our dining experience here

I went to this restaurant for a Sunday brunch. I liked the ambience very much, as well as the service. The food was good but not great. Overall it was a nice but not outstanding experience.
5
Everything was perfect from start to finish. I am in love with flavour combinations that Jason Tan has created and the presentation was perfection.
3
Food was good but not particularly a wow 3 star. Dinner omakase had three options. Had the two five courses and half a carafe house white. Bill came to 600 total for two ppl.
5
I've dine at many fine dining places around the world and I must say this are one of the best. A truly emotional meal!
Well done. Keep it up!
5
The building is beautiful, service is good, huge wine list, food is not bad, and very special green view.
4
Food nice. Environment nice. Service not bad. Huge wine list but a bit over price. Just serve everything too too rush. Even don't have time to finish a bottle of champagne.
4
Went to Corner House for a birthday celebration. Asked for a corner seat, no pun intended. Was a perfect evening with excellent attention from the staff, and great food. Loved the interpretations on the local cuisine. Very innovative. Thank you Corner House for a memorable evening.
5
Went there with a friend for the business luncheon on a Friday. Full house. Chose the 3-course set menu, and it was a treat. Best foie gras I've tasted in Singapore, pork iberico as main was a bit of a disappointment but the fish my friend has was very good and the kaya toast dessert was amazing. No doubt we'll go there again. Fantastic setting too of course, ask to be seated in the veranda where you have the best view. Lives up to its reputation, except for one waiter who was dressed in a costume and had sone black support thing on his hand, he behaved rather strange as we both thought, but otherwise you've got to try this place
5
Service staff were attentive. Food was delicious. High price was what we paid and the high value was what we got. Had a birthday celebration and we were thankful the staff wrote Happy Birthday on the dessert plate (small gesture, but warmed our hearts). The atmosphere was romantic, which definitely suited the occasion.
3
The restaurant is in a beautiful setting and service is friendly, but the price tag is not warranted. We paid $180 for a four course degustation menu with no alcohol and no tea/coffee. The food was nice, but absolutely not worth the price. Of the four courses, we only really enjoyed one (being the second main), the dessert was also nice, but the techniques are tried and tested and there was no wow factor. I'm surprised this is a Michelin restaurant. I've been to many of the Michelin(and non-Michelin) restaurants in SG and this would have to be my least favourite. Sorry to be harsh, but I just didn't think it was worth the price.
5
Great atmosphere, excellent food, good service, one of the best place in Singapore. Special mention for the deserts.
5
What a wonderful experience! Not just foods, but drinks, settings, services and ambient. Definitely one of the best fine dinings in Singapore.
5
The Corner House has lovely set lunch. The food never disappoints nor the service. Just a note the coffee and tea is ala carte and is expensive. The English breakfast tea will set you back by $9++.
5
For the creativity, ambience, service, wine list! This place deserve at minimum a 2 stars! Period! Bravo Chef Tan !
5
It's been two days since my dinner and I'm still thinking about the food...SO IMPRESSIVE! such a pleasant dining experience too.
5
Located in a heritage house in the lovely Botanical Gardens which is also Singapore's first UNESCO site, this is the perfect dining venue to impress foreign guests or a special date. Their seasonal set menus and wine pairings are highly recommended.
5
We had a wonderful time to the corner house: the menu is creative, the food is excellent and unique .
The place is Charming and authentic and the service was good.
I want to come back.
4
We had the set lunch. It was wonderfully presented and really tasty, especially the pork belly and the Patagonian toothfish. My only complaint was that the wagyu main course was a little tough considering it was wagyu and done medium rare. Otherwise, the rest of the meal was exquisite in a lovely setting.
5
We were drawn to Corner House because of the Chef's creative use of the onion, and we were not disappointed. Unfortunately, the onion is not on the lunch menu, but no matter, everything else was delicious. I opted for the three course tasting menu and my husband chose the five course option. To say the food was creative is an understatement! Every course included things that one would think wouldn't belong, but each worked perfectly. Flavors were distinct (like the yellow tomato sorbet with the foie gras), and little additions like caviar or tiny pearls of juice made each course a celebration. Service was excellent and the setting in a house in the Botanical Gardens was perfect. The whole experience was memorable
4
I have always liked Corner House food. The service staff there are also competent and accommodating. This time my husband booked the whispering corner on the balcony that has a minimum spend of $600 for 2 pax. Not difficult to meet that minimum spending with a bottle of wine and 2 degustation menus. I am glad we sat at the balcony because the inside main dining room is way too bright for me. I told them to install dimmers when I first visited them when they first opened. Clearly they don't care about my feedback. I stopped going there as there was hardly any ambiance if you sat at the main dining room-- you don't get a view and you are stuck in a rather bright room with no dim lighting. I don't remember hearing music perhaps it was too soft. I would go again only if I can secure seats on the verandah
3
Service was subpar. We tried the full degustation menu. Only the onion soup and dessert were worth consuming. I was expecting more from the Michelin badge. Tragic
4
Decent food, delicately cocked, in a good atmosphere. Wine is expensive, though it is Singapore standard ...
5
love the taste of 62 degree farm egg - the rich black truffle flavour still lingers in my head. highly recommended!
4
Over all experience was very good. Service was very good and so was the food. Loved chef"s interpretation of Carrot cake 😛😛
5
Wonderful experience in a wonderful atmosphere! The food was excellent, the staff extremely friendly and the service perfect! Definitely recommend!
5
The venue itself makes for a unique dining experience; it feels like dining in a quaint and rustic treehouse. The chefs exceeded my expectations of the Sunday brunch menu explanations. Every dish was excellently executed and presented creatively, you are definitely paying for quality and refinement. Be sure to request for a table in the main dining room by the window for optimum pleasure! Take note that the whispering corner has a minimum spend of $120++ per person for Sunday brunch. I only wished that the restaurant would have told me this the same time I made a Chope reservation (instead of the night before my reservation) as I was disappointed that the window tables in the main dining room were full. None the less, we were still offered a great corner table with nice views of the gardens and admiring the squirrels and bees in the trees :)The service crew were also attentive, polite and professional. Definitely a great place for Celebrating a special occasion for a Sunday brunch!

It was our 3rd anniversary and our first fine dinning was way overdue, so I planned to surprise my wife with a meal from this restaurant.I booked the whispering corner. And only on the day of meal, I was told that there is a minimum of $300/pax to have our meal there. We then came to an agreement to have a "customised" meal (300/pax) as their most expensive set was just 268, a tad short of the minimum spend.When we were there, environment was nice and comfy, very chilled and relaxed ambience. The major turn off was that the staff came to us and repeated the menu as "customised 300++ menu". Not cool at all. Since when did the price need to be announced when a confirmation was already made during the booking? It made me feel as if I am not able to pay for a meal like that.Other than this, everything else was extraordinary. Presentation, food, taste, we enjoyed ourselves the entire time trying the various variations of onion by the chef jason tan. Main course was extremely good, the best we had. Definitely would visit again for the experience, hopefully, a refresh is around corner.
5
This place is really romantic at night combined with the view of trees, gardens and light posts, plus this is a heritage site. You can even hear crickets and birds. Menu wise, we reserved a Veranda table (good view, more private) for a 5 course DÃ©gustation Menu and the recommended wine pair. Cant help but notice that dishes were beautifully crafted, compliments to Chef Jason. It was an absolutely fantastic experience. Highly recommended for special occasions. The crew were very helpful to cater my request since it was a special dinner. Thanks Corner House Team!!
5
Lunch in Corner House is a bliss. The place retained the original building in the Botanics Garden with a modern touch.We enjoyed the open space and beautiful surrounding from the garden and general ambience inside, with natural sunlight beaming through the large windows. The decorations were minimalistic and clean.Food was delicious and beautifully presented. Service was friendly and accommodating especially our party has a child.Our preference is to come for lunch to feel the natural light, which adds life to the place, and to walk around the garden leisurely before and after our meal.
5
Today we were treated to a special lunch by our children back in Australia. Not sure how they found this gem but happy they did. Our 3 course lunch was a taste sensation. Foie Gras - Patagonian Tooth Fish then a house speciality The Chefs Interpretation of Kaya Toast ... WOW. If you want something a little special don't hesitate to dive here!
5
We booked a table for two and choose business menu with 3 courses. Overall the lunch was good but I think it is no compare if you get with a real menu (5 or more courses). The location and services are great.
5
Beautiful stop off for a special lunch for the first day of our honeymoon. I had well researched michellin starred restaurants for us to dine in during our trip to the Far East and this did not disappoint, a beautiful lunch menu.
4
Food was good but restaurant atmosphere is not the most ideal for celebrations. Setting is more suited for business dinners and the like.
5
We went to Corner House for lunch for my wife's birthday and it did not disappoint. We had the 3 course lunch but did not take the wine pairing. All three dishes were flavourful and service was impeccable throughout the meal.
5
Its been a while since I truly enjoyed such amazing food at reasonable prices that make me want to write a justified review!Just look at the photos, they will tell a thousand words! From amuse bouche to dessert, I could not pick on anything that I couldn't eat or didn't like! The chef is truly creative and very detailed.Usually I don't like anything sour or even a tinge of it, but the chef even when creating their palate cleanser made it more refreshing than sour even though it contained lemon juice but it had poached pear and other ingredients. I'm usually not a fan of sea urchins but chef made it so tasty I am now a convert! It's really not just the ingredients but the skills of the Chef! The staff service is also impeccable, every dish was explained to me and she was very knowledgeable about the food. Very impressive! This is a casual fine dining contemporary restaurant inside botanical gardens but you feel out of the world with the attention to details from food to service. Its was my first time but definitely not the last! A must visit at least once! I can't stop raving about the food all afternoon! :)
1
It takes like almost 20-25min waiting time for each course to serve. I can hear a few tables complaining for waited too long. Food is not very fantastic except the onion course. I don't think is worth for the price I paid. I have tried Joel R. and i think with the price I paid at Corner House, I would rather pay a bit more to go Joel R. They have more variety for baguette and dessert which is free flow
4
Great food, classic French with sometimes a little twist. Beautiful venue and a great wine pairing with chich French wines. As not everyone will eat foie gras, this should be put explicitly on the menu that it's being served and an alternative offered. For ones who drink less: it should be possible to drink only two or three half glasses. Service was a little clumsy and inexperienced; you'd usually expect more savoir-vivre in a place like this
5
We tried getting into the Corner house for a meal after visiting the orchid garden. They were fully booked and we were not appropriately dressed.Made a booking for another dayWell worth it. We chose the 5 course meal. Everything was so well prepared, presented and serve
5
Had the regular tasting menu here and was overly impressed. The setting is gorgeous in the Botanical Gardens, and the service is top notch. Everything that I ordered or drank was near perfect. I was visiting town from New York and have to say that the food here is better than most of the 1 stars that I have been to in NY. My favorite part was the dessert that came together perfectly inclusive of a wide array of flavors. Whole meal was very inventive and well executed
3
Food: We had dinner there and was asked whether we wanted the 5 or 9 courses. While we wanted to choose the 9 course- my partner asked if they have a selection which is diary-free (as he was lactose intolerant). Much to our dismay, the waiter then told us to get the 5 course instead. When dinner arrived, the 5 course looked scarcely prepared and not well done; tho we could see that there was some effort. Even the dessert was a miserable 2 piece sorbet. Place: Being in botanical gardens is romantic. The idea is romantic. But there are bugs and mosquitoes biting you so be prepared to be scratching. The staff will offer repellent - but the smell is strong and affects human dates too. A restaurant of this standard but no option for people who are lactose intolerant. And on top of that, they served nespresso as coffee options. I would recommend this only for the experience but there are many good restaurants in singapore for the price but better food and ambience
5
came here for a birthday lunch, service was excellent (staff were friendly and prompt), food and wine was great, view of the park was relaxing. would come back again
5
Not only beautiful, but delicious, Creative and simply amazing. The best service in a unique location within the Botanical Gardens.
And for Singapore, very good value !
5
My wife and I splurged on the Menu Degustation with wine pairing and we were delighted right from the Amuse Bouche all the way to the dessert!
My favourite dishes were the Maine Lobster and the Toriyama Beef. Totally delicious!
Definitely coming back!
5
nice place and location in botanic garden
very nice food and good set lunch
totally worth the price!
5
Met up with a dear friend who recommended Corner House, which is situated within the Botanic Gardens. The view is lovely in the day so I would suggest lunch here for those enjoy the lush greenery.We both had the 3-course business lunch & I selected the foie gras, wagyu beef & kaya toast dessert. The mix of ingredients was refreshing & I enjoyed the food very much. The servings may be a bit small for big eaters but sufficient for me. For the price point ($66 per pax including the supplement for the beef), it was worth the money.We also received attentive service from the wait staff who briefly explained each dish when serving. Overall, Corner House is a lovely place for a relaxing lunch.
4
Our first experience at the "Corner" was very pleasant...we loved the setting ...beautiful view of the garden..The service was fast and professional...not too pretentious...the food was delicious, nice presentation, and not really expensive...I particularly liked the dessert We'll probably return one more time before we return to the States
4
We visited Corner House on a Thursday. The venue which is located in the Botanical Garden in a black and white House has been around for a while although Corner House is a relatively newer venue. The menus were interesting - there were choices of a larger as well as four or five course menus including one vegetarian option. The menu is cheaper than many top restaurants in Singapore.The food was good but we felt really let down by the dessert. Whilst salted egg and pineapple are common dessert ingredients in Singapore, it was disappointing. The kaya toast option sounded better. Otherwise the mains were very good especially the lobster, beef and fish dishes. A suggestion for the restaurant:- to explain the dishes especially the amuse bouche. Service was OK but not exceptional. The venue would be lovely for lunch given the venue.
5
They provide a number of set courses with optional wine pairings, which are recommended. There was some crossover in the sets, but both we had were superb. They were happy to make changes for a gluten allergy. Too expensive for frequent vists but absolutely worth it for special occasions.
5
2nd visit in 2 years with a refresh in menu, presentation was lovely, flavours came together nicely and the ambience calming. One area for improvement would be pacing of the dishes where some courses came too fast while others seem to take a while. Service staff was competent and knowledgeable. Thoroughly enjoyed our meal, will definitely be back for more!
5
The food was one of the best tastings I've ever had. I loved the balance of focus between proteins and vegetables. There was a pleasant and interesting twist on basic things that just made each dish over the top delicious. The services couldn't have been more perfect and of course the location within the botanical gardens made the ambiance magical. If I had to list a complaint, I would say the wine pairing was underwhelming.
5
A great insight to French cusine in a Singaporean's point of view! A great way to have experienced a Michelin star restaurant!
5
We enjoyed our lunch at the Corner House. Every dish was perfect and had a great flavor and creativity. The nuts/cranberry bread - to die for! Must visit when at the Botanical Gardens.
4
Setting is very pleasant, menu interesting and food excellent. Just a pity that wine by the glass at $40+. And wine served was ok, not outstanding.
4
Nice and interesting food, romantic ambience and good service! 👍🏼
Would definitely visit the place with friends and family.
5
Five star service and the discovery menu is a must. Fantastic wine list although on the pricey side.
Shall return
4
Each plate is stunning with multiple elements that works excellently well together. The balance of flavours and textures is amazing. Though dishes were all solid, it was not mind blowing, as there are some spots in Singapore like Terra which has perfect food.
2
We were expecting something very special after reading about corner house. However the food was not what you would expect from a Michelin star restaurant. Trying too hard, doubt about the freshness of the ingredients and extremely over priced wine list even for Singapore. I've had better dining experiences at places for a tenth of the price. Won't be going back.
4
Excellent place with very delicious dishes. I highly recommend for the wine pairing, which you can enjoy variety of wines with each course. Price is a bit of challenge though and location is inside Botanic Garden where it makes you walk 10 min from the Parking Lot. Last but not least, the waiters and waitress are very friendly and have a good senses!
4
The staple at the Singapore Botanic Gardens is famed by a lot of people in Singapore. With the Botanic Gardens gaining it’s UNESCO Heritage status, it’s nice that Corner House, a restaurant housed in a beautiful colonial house also gained it’s Michelin Star status.Carefully crafted meals with a touch of art served in rooms with natural light, lush gardens within view
5
We arrived before 7pm and left at 10pm. Had a table by the large windows overlooking the gardens. Service was neat, and not intrusive. Dinner was splendid. The Maine lobster and Wagyu dishes were my favorites. Pineapple, the dessert dish, was excellent. Would recommend a walk by the Swan Lake before dinner.
5
We went there for client business lunch on a weekday. Surprisingly the restaurant at Botanical Garden is quite pack on weekday. the Business lunch set is value for money. Food are delicious
5
One of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had. Food was amazing and the athmosphere was unique.
3
The dishes are unique and artfully arranged. It was quite the experience. We visited for dinner and since it was dark the beauty of the garden setting was lost--so it was more like eating on the glassed in deck of an old house with 3 other tables. I'm not sure what the other seating rooms are like, but I recommend going daytime to enjoy the greenery. The prices are quite high (wine even higher), and I found the length of the dinner to be too long. From the area I saw, you would need to be able to walk up stairs to dine here
1
Service very mechanical and no communication. Not even a description of each dish. No sommelier, no maître d'hôtel. That evening it was mostly empty and when I asked for a table slightly larger I was told that this was for a minimum spending of 300++ per pax. In front of a customer it is not polite to use the word "pax". Also the minimum spending table concept is strange given that the cheapest menu starts at 158++ 
5
We ordered 2 Lunch Discovery sets, from the amuse bouche to petite fours, each course was amazing presenation of gastro-botanico cuisine. I like the bread with butter so much that I asked for more, and my boyfriend loves foie gras lu shui a lot. The salted egg yolk macaron was fantastic, although too small
3
We chose the 4 course luncheon menu the norwegian salmon was awesome but the rest was not. It was ok dont get me wrong but not as good as the first entree. Waygu was perfectly cooked but had no taste, patagonian toothfish was nice but not outstanding. Deserts were ok.Service was very good during the meal.Expected so much more
4
Two of us had lunch on a wet humid day. The restaurant is situated in a fabulous setting in the Botanic Garden. We settled for the business lunch as we were intending to have a significant dinner in our final night in Singapore. Both of our starters were superb. Simply done but the flavours were immense. For our mains we had the Wagu Beef and the Imberico Pork. Both dishes were also excellent and beautifully presented. Our final course was the Kaya Toast dessert and again delightful. Throughout the meal each dish was explained and the service was impeccable. The only but was that my wife ordered breakfast tea to accompany the desert. It came in a cup( no pot) and was so weak she thought they had forgotten the tea leaves. A pity because this is a lovely restaurant in a great place and we will make a return despite the tea.
5
Can't fault. Loved everything I was served. Kingfish sashimi was a great start. Pork jowl with potato foam was so full of flavour and my soursop sorbet was the perfect way to complete my meal. Every element on each plate had a reason to be there. The flavour profile was ten out of ten.Service was great. Attentive and not in your face. Location. Have always loved this little hideaway. It's so green and continues to feel so peaceful. Great getaway from busy Singapore. This is a place to take your time to enjoy mastery and artistry of each course. If you are not in a hurry, order a hot drink after your meal to soak in the ambience.Tip: closed on MondaysTip: Corner House offers a buggy service.
5
Deserving of its Michelin star; right by the Ginger Garden in the Botanic GardenOur party had the four and five course menus and each course was original, beautifully presented and very tasty. Staff are wonderful, eager to ensure guests enjoy themselves and eager to explain the unique dishesWe had a fantastic evenin

A very memorable meal. The food was fantastic and the service was impeccable. One of my favorites in Singapore!! Nestled in the Botanic Garedens of Singapore, the Corner House offers a very unique dining experience. Not only was the ambiance fantastic, the food was amazing.They say "a picture is worth a thousand words"... here is my 10,000-word review!!!

Good experience...fantastic location in a botanical gardens. The Discovery Menù is a wonderful choise....

I rarely give a full mark but this restaurant really deserved it.
Great location in the middle of the botanic gardens. Great staff very attentive but also discrete. Amazing food. We had a very diverse menu which we really enjoyed.

We had high hopes for this place, but the food is extremely unremarkable, especially for its price. what added salt to the wound was the blatent disrespect for the ingredients. most of the produce was frozen. this place should have its star removed.
5
Food was delicious, original and creative. My colleague, client and I were impressed by the overall experience. Staff were knowledgeable and attentive. We all will definitely make more visits in the future

Nice atmosphere, good service. Good for your special day.
We can walk around after the dinner. That's nice experience.

The restaurant is located in the botanical gardens and is a wonderful place to visit after walking around the gardens. The food is a set menu and it is beyond excellent. The wagyu beef was brilliant and tender while the lobster was the best I've ever had. The service is superb, and the staff were incredibly friendly and hospitable. It is recommended to book in advance and we were lucky to get a reservation although we went on a Monday. Admittedly the food is pricey but it is certainly worth paying for.

made a first seating reservation at 630pm. there was another couple who came before us waiting and it was already 635pm, the sign at the door said closed. no one came to attend to us and the sign still said closed at 7pm, we can see that they were still having a briefing at the counter. we then opened the door and went in, that was when they invited us in to the restaurant! for a high end fine dining restaurant, this was unacceptable. i give them the benefit of the doubt that they didn't know we were diners waiting outside but they should change the door sign to open at 630pm when they open for business.the restaurant is quiet, good for couples. get a seat near the glass window, i find the seats in the main dining area a little cramped when i passed it to go to the ladies. the food is good with the exception of cod fish. it was fishy but the crispy skin was well done. recommended for the settings and food but service could be improved

I wanted to try Corner House on a recent visit to Singapore, so went for Sunday brunch/lunch. The brunch/lunch set menu is tasty, interesting, and beautifully presented. For $SGD 88, I thought it was good value, and a good way to experience what Corner House has to offer. A beautiful setting within the botanic gardens. Service professional and friendly. The wine list is impressive and extensive, but also very expensive: $SGD 47 for a glass of house champagne, and similar prices for the house wines. Expect to pay around of $300 SGD for a bottle. You can view wine lists and menus on their website
5
Our party chose the degustation menu, the food was an explosion of taste that was unsurpassed, with matching wines that made it a perfect combination of food and wine. The service was unobtrusive yet efficient, while the atmosphere was perfect for our party.( see sat on the balcony) The only complaint was the taxi drivers had NO idea where the Nassim Gate at the Botanical Gardens was located, in fact it look 50 minutes for what should have been a 10 minute fare. The restaurant needs to have clearer directions to the their location. Once at the restaurant we gave a 10 out of 10 for the food service and atmosphere
5
This restaurant is simply beautiful. It is set in the botanical gardens and if you are smart you will plan to spend an extra hour or two before dinner just walking around because it is so pretty here. Unfortunately the restaurant doesn't open until 6 because the views out the windows are so nice, it is a shame that the sun has to go down. The food is beautifully presented and many of the menu choices are quite extraordinary. We chose the 5 course menu and were not disappointed. My favorite dish was the peanut butter, Kaya pandan dessert, but the crispy scales cod fish and the wagyu beef and Mangalista pork cheeks were very good too. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is a foodie and loves good presentation and finely crafted artisan dishes. I took a taxi to the address as listed but had to walk into the gardens in order to actually get to the restaurant. Once I figured out where it was it was not difficult at all to get to
5
The 5course dinner was pretty nice and well designed. Chef really put his passion in his food. Great place and we will definitely go back.
5
We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and attention to details in service. Strongly recommend to be pampered!
4
Service staff were friendly, attentive and prompt. Were seated close to the window so had a great view of the botanic garden. Had the wagyu beef but found it so so. Prefer the fish that my wife ordered. Both of us enjoyed our desserts tremendously.
4
I went there to celebrate birthday for my husband and it's a pleasant one. The food is well served and the staffs were very friendly to us. A place where both of us would go back again.
3
Food was good; prices were justifiable if rating based on food alone. What was most disappointing and ruined the experience was how my group was made to pass through the rear stair well, which was also being used by the servers. We were directed to use the service entrance to get to our table on the second floor, only to find out at the end of the meal that there was another stairwell at the front, accessible from the side of the entrance, where customers did not have to stand aside to allow servers and their trays to pass by, another entrance where customers did not have to see stacks of kitchen equipment. Lastly, the restroom at the ground floor was filthy. There was another restroom, but this was out of order during our visit. Still, there is no reason to have a filthy restroom, especially if customers are paying 400-500 SGD per head

I went with my wife during our recent holidays in Singapore. The restaurant is located on a very beautiful park what makes the experience nicer if you want to take a walk before or after dinner. Before Christmas it was also very lightly and decorated. We took the discovery menu experience. We enjoyed very much the amuse Bouche, but to be honest I was not enthusiastic about the signature dish: I like onions but not a fan to that extent that there's onion taste everywhere. The botanica was decent and I didn't like the pork: just some slices of bacon over a risotto. Too sticky for me. The langoustine was the best dish and I didn't like the first dessert as well. All in all I cannot say it's bad, but no more than 1 star for m

My Husband and i chose to celebrate our anniversary at the Corner House as we were in Singapore and we really enjoy trying fixed menus with wine parings. The concierge at the hotel arranged the reservation for us. the cab dropped us off at the furthest entrance to the Botanical Gardens from the restaurant (not being familiar with the area we did not know better) so we had to walk across the gardens at night, in the rain. We were late by 10 minutes. The restaurant staff apologized stating the cabs often do that to tourists, and they would arrange our cab for the trip back to the hotel.We were seated on the second floor. The restaurant is an older former residence made into a restaurant with in the gardens. Unique and interesting. We went for the four course dinner with wine pairings. The amuse bouche was ok, nothing to get excited about.First course was the Maine Lobster - and a larger portion than i was expecting. It was well prepared, lobster can get chewy if not done well, but this was good. The Zucchini paired well and the sauce was good.Second course - Pork Jowl with Truffle - very good, generous with the truffle.Third course - Chicken with lobster - it was again a larger portion than i was expecting, and although very good, starting to get full. The sauce was excellent.Four course - dessert - a peanut butter type spread that apparently is very popular in Singapore. It was Ok. There is a whole write up about why he chose this and what he likes about it, but after so much food, something lighter would have been nice.The wine pairing were ok, although they are not overly generous with the wine. The service was mixed. We had two waiters who alternated and several staff for clearing etc. The one was excellent, explaining the food, the wine, preparation etc. The other was rather curt and a bit rude. We have done many fixed menus at top end restaurants, and i will say, i am no expert, but the food itself is good and deserving of the michelin star. The presentation was excellent, the restaurant is very clean. The clientel on our night was mainly young Singapore couples who seemed very impressed with their meals, taking picture of it and speaking very little. However, for the price tag, not so satisfied. For two people, with the added service charge and taxes it was just under $600 Singapore. I have dined at many higher end restaurants and found the experience more satisfying. If you are looking to spend a lot of money for a meal, this is the place, and you will have a good meal of interesting food. Some parts of the meal i found very good, others, not so much. Overall it is good, however would i go back? No, i did not feel that the experience was worth the money. It would fall under the "been there, done that.

Corner House deserves its Michelin star. The food is delicious and well-presented. It's in an old bungalow located in the Botanic Gardens so the ambience is very nice.Service is good although it could be a bit warmer. It will also be better if they have more wine options.Definitely a place to try at least once but we will definitely go back
5
We went there for dinner after reading many great reviews about this place. The restaurant is in a bungalow in the middle of the botanical gardens and so while having dinner we felt like we were in a forest/garden which felt very special. All of us had the degustation menu. Highlights of the meal were the 'my favourite vegetable' course which was onion done 3 ways, 'botanica' platter which was consists of over 40 vegetables- very pleasing to the eyes, the forest floor dessert (very pretty again!). Staff were very friendly and informative. Would recommend this place
5
The ambience is very soothing,like dining in the wild but without all the bugs/flies.Food is very exquisite and well designed by Chef Jason.every course is a surprise and there are many details in the presentation.Service is professional with them explaining the food before you commence.Will definitely return with other friend
4
Took my husband here for his Birthday whilst in Singapore. Lunch was good value and very good. Wine is incredibly expensive in Singapore and no more so here! Do book in advance I could only book lunch some time ahead
5
The setting is perfect for a romantic lunch during weekdays! Food was also really nice, fusion with great local flavors.
5
Had a awesome dinner last night! Food, service and excellent wine selections. Very good combination of favours! Excellent creation by Chef.
5
Not my first visit. I like the setting of the restaurant in an old colonial bungalow in Botanic Gardens. My fav dish is the cod with crispy scales
5
Went for dinner and enjoyed the botanical menu - vegetarian for sure but so full of flavour in every dish - The Onions Cevennes is an absolute must-try even if you opt for the non-veg menu options - a nod to the Arpeche in Paris for sure, but in their very own way - brilliant. Also the zuccini dish was outstanding. The food here is clearly 2-3 star michelin quality.The decor however needs a serious brush up - chairs with upholstery that look inspired by a british airways first-class lounge (and that is not a compliment) and a weird golden 2001-style artpiece on the wall accentuated by horrible ceiling lighting mainly halogen spots that blind your eye should you inadvertently happen to glance upwards.I will definitely come again and it will be for the food - which is close to genious
1
Horrible service!!! The waiters rather be on the cell phone or chatting with other waiters than to serve their customers. The food was terrible!!! We went because of the reviews we saw online. We were very disappointed with both the service and food. Will not recommend anyone to go to this restaurant!

Love how the website described this place:"Corner House is shaped by many inspirations. The strands of history, science, memory, art, passion and gastronomy come together to create a luminous experience in a singular setting." Indeed, that's exactly how you would feel about the place and the food. One of my best fine dining experiences in a lovely and uncomplicated setting. It is awarded No. 17 for ASIAâ€™S 50 Best Restaurants in 2016.We chose the 3-course Business lunch, while the portions are small it was a quite fulfilling meal. Each dish was elegantly plated with a mixture of unexpected yet well-integrated flavors.If you are taking the MRT, making sure you leave 15-20 minutes for the walk, we were surprised that not too many local people knew about this place to give us the precise directions. Basically, once you entered the Botanic Garden, follow the sign to visitors' center and the Corner House is right before the center on the right-hand side
5
This is the place for you if you want a relaxing afternoon amongst the lush surroundings of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, in a British Colonial black and white house, with exquisite food (beautiful plating), wine and good service. First time we were at The Corner House, we sat at The Verandah. It is great for couples and small group (up to 4) of friends. Very light and airy. Makes one feel like you're dining in the tree tops. Second time, we sat in The Main Room with 10 other friends. Totally different vibe but nonetheless very cozy and personal. Both times the food was spot-on. Everyone was impressed by the quality. I'm now trying to find an excuse to visit again ... hmmmm ..
3
The pros : beautiful setting inside the botanic gardens. Some excellent dishes (chicken dish, Black Forest as a dessert). The cons: location requires some walking before reaching the restaurant, which could be problematic in case of heavy rain. There was lots of pressure from the restaurant to confirm the booking, but when we reached we found that less than 50% of the tables were occupied?? An essential part of a gastronomic meal is the presentation of the dishes and the explanation of how they are prepared, but for our meal this was too often rushed and done with little clarity.
5
We came with no expectation and left 110% satisfied with the food and our experience. The service was first rate, the food exceptional and the wine perfectly matched. It's on the expensive side of course because fine dining like this is rare! Thanks to Chef Jason, Ben and the team for a memorable night!
5
We went there for a client business lunch. Food was good, service was great. Clients love the food. Excellent
2
Eye-wateringly expensive, small portions and stingy pours on the tasting menu with wine pairing. I would not recommend it.
5
It was our first time at corner house. The service was excellent and the food was fantastic. The foie gras was interesting light. Cod fish was cooked really well, with the skin done beautifully
5
We love fine dining, and this was one of the best fine dining experiences we have ever had. The food was a visual masterpiece and taste explosion. Easily the best fine dining in Singapore :-)
3
The food was good overall. The ambience would have been fantastic if the restaurant wasn't as busy and noisy as it was on the night.
5
This is a charming restaurant located in the botanical garden that is also an outstanding culinary experience. Overall the tasting menu was superb with many flavorful dishes and interesting combinations. The veranda was lovely and the setting superb in some ways making the restaurant. This is one of the better restaurants in Singapore and worth a visit
4
Positives: beautiful view from the balcony seat, amazing lychee martini to start, and the set menu brunch very reasonably priced. But in contrast the wine was crazy expensive, just silly prices. And the bread starter with sweet croissants and pain au chocolat was plain weird. Might go back during the week again and simply abstain from wine, which I hate to do but I can't bring myself to pay obscene prices.
4
Excellent dinner, very refined food, very attentive service. We missed to be in the verandah to enjoy the nature, even if we send a special request. We had our dinner in the dining room instead, nothing special for the decoration. Go if you are sure to get the right spot

This isn't meant to sound like bragging but I have friends who are real goodies so I have been to a good many Michelin-starred restaurants in Europe, the US and parts of Asia, but a trip to Jason Tan's upscale botanical-themed restaurant was one of the best meals I have ever had.Situated in Singapore's Botanical Gardens, Corner House is based in a beautiful colonial-era bungalow. If it is too hot or humid to walk the five minutes from the edge of the gardens, the staff will dispatch a golf buggy to pick you up from the taxi drop-off point.We chose the nine-course degustation tasting menu and the staff dealt with my animatedly weird food allergies (chocolate, cheese and orange) without a blink.Each course, plus four - yes four - amuses bouche - was sublime. It just in taste, but in texture and plating. Tan turns food into an art form, beautifully presented botanicals, tubers, fungi and roots with fish, shellfish and meats from around the world. The botanicals course in itself consisted of 40 degrees fervent vegetarian elements all by itself. Wage beef, langoustines from Mozambique were complemented with items as diverse as rosa, white truffle and black radish.Of course it's not cheap, because t it is a beautiful, intimate restaurant with world-class, knowledgeable and attentive staff
4
I always like the location ...nice greenery. Good for lunch or romantic dinner. If I am lazy to walk that 5-7 mins from car park to restaurant , I will call for the buggy.I am not sure how the chef cook the chicken breast... it is so good! But I am disappointed with their signature maya toast dessert ...but the rest of the food are great. If u going for a romantic dinner, ask for the table in the small balcony or the deck area ...I personally like that 
3
The environment is good, nice view, choose to seat at the premium seat (min $300++ per pax), the food presentation is very nice, but tasting very normal, no surprise at all.
5
I chose menu of 3 dishes for lunch.
Portion was good. Dishes were innovative and very delicious.
Restaurant is in a historical botanical garden. 3 minutes from main gate on foot. Very nice atmosphere.
Service was attentive. Perfect!
5
ate the lunch set which is really nice, A4 beef and the pandan dessert. The ambience was nice situated in the botanic garden and service was good
5
Had a long and enjoyable lunch with a friend in this very relaxing place. We ordered different sets for lunch and both were equally good. Their Pimm's is, for me, the best in Singapore. Each dish was noticeably made from fresh ingredients and creatively prepared. My personal favorites are the Onion Soup and the Chef's version of the Kaya Toast. The service was also excellent. I'm definitely coming back the next time I'm back for another visit

Having been wanting to try out this place since it opened I finally made a reservation to celebrate my grandmother's 82nd birthday at Corner House! The entire family went for the Business Luncheon menu.Service all around was excellent, attentive and the staff were highly informative about the dishes. Bread served with butter was available throughout the meal and the freshly baked rolls and slices were so lovely in texture and flavor.The layout the place is very cozy, open with a very clean palette, seats that would be considered 'outdoors' which are on the many balconies of the colonial building are actually enclosed within the indoors with glass over the outside so you are always in the comfort of the air conditioning.The highlights of the meal would have to be the foie gras, wagyu and my interpretation of kaya for me. The components for the foie gras were extremely complementary although the flavors were not new the presentation was a feast for the eyes. The wagyu was perfectly done to medium rare and the soy caramel was delicious, especially for those who like savory and sweet together. For me tasting the various familiar flavors of kaya toasts in the dessert course was definitely a pleaser. Some other things to mention was that a few of us felt that the citrus/sour notes clashed a lot with the subtle chocolate flavor in the Earl Grey yin zhen dessert. Also the use of all very large round plates which left much of the plates in all three courses looking very empty was something we noted. We felt that there could have been use of maybe plates of a different shape to complement the food although it's understandable that the chef has his reasons for the presentation on all round large plates. Overall a great experience, the lunch set is a great way to experience Chef Jason Tan's Gastro Botanica genre of cuisine
4
Ambiance was lovely. Simple blank and white theme. Tables were too close to each other but thankfully guests were not noisy. Surprised that there was no dress code as someone with jeans and sport shoes was dining. Food was enjoyable. Though lobsters were not entirely fresh, the pork was exquisite and beef perfectly done. Dessert was creative and a huge surprise on the upside.
3
Corner House is located inside the botanical gardens. It's a beautiful space in a very tranquil setting. The service is accommodating and the food is presented beautifully but with that said, there's nothing truly craveable there that I walked away still thinking about and would want to have again. It's a great place if you want to impress a date or business partner. There was the highlight of the salted egg yolk bun flavored macaron during dessert that my husband appreciated because he loves salted egg yolks buns so much but other than that, with so much amazing food in this city, there are better ways to spend your money.
2
We were a big group and dinner reservation was booked through our travel agent. It was a nice setting in a private area which is good to start with. However, the overall dinning experience is disappointing. Very unprofessional service. Does not deserve to be a Michelin star restaurant. First of all, we were told by the travel agent that our main course will be beef but we were ended up serving pork. The waiting time between dishes is long, can up to 15 minutes or more. No further description were given to each course when they were served. The waiter and the supervisor Jeremy were standing aside playing with their phones rather than serving us with more wine or checking on us to see if we need anything else. A big drama arises when we ask for the bill cause we were then told there is a minimum of SDG$8,000 and we still had almost $2,500 to cover. We were pissed off. It was already 11 pm, everybody were tired. The supervisor should have let us know in the very beginning when we select the wine, we could have picked more expensive ones. Indeed, the first 3 bottles that we had selected were out of stock. Even during the middle of our meal we could order more but he simply not care. We do not mind to pay the minimum but this is not a professional way on how they handle our situation. We will never come back nor recommend anyone to come.
2
Food was decent however the pacing of the dishes was extremely bad. Did a 5 course dinner and in dishes in between took too long. Also ordered wine pairing (not tasting) with the dishes but was sorely disappointed again as (a) they poured the wine 15mins before the dish comes out (which sometimes i finish the wine before the dish or the chilled white have turned warm and (b) they serve so little wine almost like a tasting portion of 2 mouthfuls. Making it worst, the playlist they had was from spotify and how do i know? Thats because they did not pay for a premium account and after every 3 - 4 tracks, it will be playing an advertisement selling spotify premium for $9.99. Imagine savouring your steak to an advertisement, brilliant! The last icing was never once did a server approach me to ask how was the meal or anything, because i wanted to give them these feedback to improve but to no avail. Left the place sorely disappointed expecting better for a SGD600 meal and will not visit again until things improve

A conserved bungalow located within the Singapore Botanics Garden is now a fine dining French restaurant. The choice are yours to select as to how many courses you want. Portions are delicately and prettily presented and small but adequate for most diners. Ambience is good and staff are attentive. There is also a selection of wines and hard liquor. A good place to celebrate special occasions with friends or family. Parking can be daunting though as there are crowds visiting the garden in the evenings
3
Average food with reasonable price...the dishes are quite ok the atmosphere is quite nice since it's a stand alone building
5
Chef Jason Hau has created a magnificent menu!! A most stunning location, definitely a treat.
The Kaya toast inspired dessert was mouth watering.
5
with an assortment of appetizers and croissants/bread, the 3 course Sunday brunch is excellent value for S$78++. Every dish was good, and the ambience was great.
5
Celebrated my wife's birthday recently at Corner House. It was not disappointing at all. We had the five course menu with wine pairing. The food was not only delicious but also very aesthetically plated. All in, it was great food, nice wine and excellent service.
3
Went to this place, seated at the verandah. The view was lovely, as you dine and wine as if seated within a huge garden. The food came after 20 mins, but they gave us the food from the wrong table! both were wrong dishes. We ate one mouth and realised it was wrong. They were quick to take it back, and apologised (with some wine). Food was so - so for the price it charged ($58 for a set lunch, $58 +6 for a set lunch that came with beef)
4
classic ambience, located inside botanic gardens. we had the business luncheon set which is very reasonable in pricing. food was presented in an artistic way. I particularly liked the mangalitsa pork though the hub didn't find the wagyu beef impressive. request for balcony/window seats for a more romantic feel.
5
Visited it the first time last week on a weekday. Unable to get a reservations from Chope but I called the restaurant and was offered one. Parked at the covered carpark at Nassim Road entrance (Car park A or B). Just a 2 minute walk to the restaurant which is located within a black/white bungalow style house. Beautiful greenery all around with terraces that are glassed up for air-conditioned comfort. Unfortunately we were unable to get a table in the terrace as they were all reserved (but noticed some diners did not show up and tables were left empty). We ordered the Discovery Set Lunch it was a gastronomic pleasure. Chef was able to accommodate some changes for me as I do not eat certain food. Waiter was friendly and we certainly felt very relaxed and enjoyed the meal (although a terrace view would have been even better). The restaurant is closed between lunch and dinner (unfortunately not offering high teas which would be a thumbs up!)
4
Went last Friday for business lunch , was greeted by a lush green in the heart of botanic garden. Walked to double storey old houses built 100 over years ago where the restaurant resided. The ambience was good as the green was just surrounded you. Food was fantastic and worth a try if you haven't been! Service was good with knowledgeable staff. Thumbs up..
5
The food was well balanced and really nice. The service was excellent and could not be better. The ambiance was great, although it could be a little bit warmer in the restaurant in my opinion. The only negative point is, that the wines are really expensive
5
We have dined at Corner House on many occasions, starting from well before they were given their Michelin Star. We, and indeed, our guests, have always been delightfully surprised by each experience of Chef Jason Tan's magical skills , and not even once been disappointed. Jason is a genius at merging exciting tastes and textures. From the amuse bouche through to the desserts, every dish is given full and equal attention - from amazing visual detail and to surprising your palate with sublime tastes. We have taken his meals without alcohol and still found each dish a moment to treasure. Most floor staff are excellent and knowledgeable. At lunch or brunch you can experience the beautiful Botanical Gardens' environment - ask for a table in the Verandah or the Whispering Corner. A second Michelin star must soon give Corner House its deserved recognition. The culinary experience exceeds expectations, always
4
Loved the colonial house setting in the Botanical Gardens, with a great view of the greenery. We had the Sunday brunch set which was good and artfully presented. Definitely deserved the one Michelin star!
5
A great One Star restaurant in an old colonial house in the middle of the Botanic Gardens. We had the three course set lunch and the Wagyu beef was the best. In fact the beef portion was much bigger then most restaurants. I didn't go for the coffee since they use the "N capsules" rather then fresh brewed / grounded coffee. Apparently they also have a surprise dinner dinner menu.
5
I expected a lot from this restaurant in a way. First of all, it is fully booked for dinner in a few weekends away. So much so that i have to settle for lunch on a weekday in order to secure a table for 4. Second, the restaurant is nestled in the beautiful botanical gardens ground and hence, they need to deliver in order to match up this great location. Thirdly, it just got awarded one michelin star. So, the verdict is... Corner House delivers. Food wise, the dishes are creatively put together with amazing favours and the plating looks so good. The portions are just good for us and we had the 4-course lunch menu. The ingredients are also good quality to match this price level of the menu. All in all, i would say it is well worth the money. Service wise, hmm... It can be better. I was not too thrilled when the hostess at the door did not smile or even greeted me properly. The service staff is fine but nothing to shout about. This is the one area that the restaurant should pay some attention. Ambience wise, it is a fantastic location. Noise level is also low. I believe the soft furnishing of the chairs and the padded tables help. I will return.

My last visit as 16 years ago when it was known as le Jardin. This trip was equally memorable. Food was first rate. squid risotto and the organic milk dessert was perfection. Only blemish was the description of the various dishes. Servers, while attentive and precise, had difficulty describing clearly what we were eating. I had to ask them to repeat themselves on several occasions.
4
My girlfriend and I went to corner house for an early birthday celebration. We were greeted by two very unwelcoming hostess (one who was on the phone did not even look up to make eye contact let alone acknowledge our presence. The other who showed us to our didn't even smile or give us a proper greeting). The food started off a little underwhelming. The bread was fine. We were served 3 amuse bouche at the start of the meal. 2 out of the 3 seemed kind of lazy (oyster leaf and fish cracker) but the cucumber with mustard seeds was a redeeming factor. After that the meal just went from glaringly mediocre to fantastic. Dish after dish we were wowed. From the first course to the last everything was not only visually stunning but tasted great. It would take too long to go into detail for each dish so I'll just point out the few stand out. The Brittany cuttlefish with riso and the 2 desserts (Kaya with peanut butter and organic milk from Limousin). It was down right near impossible to find fault with these 3 dishes even if I wanted to. I would highly recommend anyone going to corner house to try these. Unfortunately when we were served our petit fours, service took another step backwards. The assistant manager whose name is Jeremy if I am not mistaken was incredibly rude and unprofessional. He basically just presented the dish while half heartdly explaining it. Fine I can accept that. Maybe you've had a long day at work and you are tired. But he than shot us this look of impatience and irritation after explaining. Was it because it was late and he wanted to go home? Considering that the total bill came up to nearly 500 dollars I was expecting more finesse from front of house. All in all the food was fantastic. Service on the other hand needs more work. It may seem that service as a whole was terrible but on the contrary it wasn't. The only problems with service were stated on top. There were 2 service staff who made our meal very pleasant. Roldan and Freddy (I hope I'm spelling their names right) did an excellent job. From menu suggestions to small talk they made us feel welcomed

I had very high expectations from this dinner, that is why maybe I was a bit disappointed. TO IMPROVE:- The reception ladies were absolutely unfriendly, they welcome you like robots looking you from down to up, no smile at all. - Bring a cover because you will feel cold!- Service staff should be prepared to answer questions about the plates, know the origin of the products they are serving... I am very sorry to say I did not get most of the dishes explanation although I made them repeat several times. They speak really fast with no efforts to be understood. They were friendly though, but according to myself lack of practice and professional attention. We had a ask for more bread approx 15min after finising the basket, we were waiting to see if anyone will notice which they did not.- They won't ask you if you need another bottle of water. For us, they just poured the whole left bottle in my glass, leaving my husband's glass empty, and came back with a new bottle opened at the dessert time when we had finish our courses! Of course they charged 2 bottles, which is not the problem here, but you can see the lack of attention to details.- Table clothes please!!! Our table was on the balcony, really nice view. But the edge of the leather table was broken and appeared really not nice.- They requested my name to make me a personal card signed by the chef, which I did not get (I must say I did not request for it neither before leaving).POSITIVE - The place is absolutely romantic, and nice. You feel like a guest from colonial times.- Request for a table in balcony, you will feel in the gardens!- The food is nice, creative for some dishes, not creative at all for others (to my personal standards!). We enjoyed most of the food, specially the onion interpretation by the chef! I believe there is a minimum of standard that some restaurants should have to be kept in the gastronomic side. A better training of the staff will make the experience for the guest much better, and a quick smile when you arrive will be appreciated. Although there is room for improvement, I must say it was a relatively good experience, which is not cheap. Maybe I am too demanding, but to my personal standards, I believe a 1 star restaurant should offer a perfect experience to guests and excellent choice of ingredients

Had an enjoyable dinner and the service was attentive throughout. The strawberry dessert was one of the best we've ever had. We were puzzled however why a restaurant like this would allow toddlers in to dine in the main dining area. This created a strange ambience despite the parents best efforts to engage with the children. I strongly encourage a review of this policy, or at least to police their own over six year old policy they said they had in place. Others clearly were not happy with the situation - many hoping to enjoy a night out away from their own kids!

We had a degustation dinner at this famous restaurant, nestled in the compounds of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. What a wonderful experience it is for all of us. The food is excellent in taste and presentation and with the ambience and fantastic service, we truly had a very memorable experience. I would love to come again for a repeat

Went there for dinner recently after noting it received one Michelin Star. Have been there years ago. The setting is still very nice but feel the food although beautifully presented was nothing memorable. The bread was nice later regret not asking for more as the dinner portions were so small. Even for small eaters like us, did not feel full after the meal. We had the 4 course and the 5 course meal. The best part was the cod which was very nicely cooked with crispy skin. But the portion was really small. Nothing else was worth going back for. The beef, rice with squid were all very blend. Really not sure what the hype is all about
5
Went for a birthday dinner. Basically 4 menus avlaiable, one vegetarian and one for gluttons. So practically only two to choose from. Sort of place where you have plenty of time to chat with friends and didnt need lots of time with the menu. We choose the same set but two variations on desert. presentation was immaculate and the portions were reasonably generous for this type of restaurant. service attentive and unobstrusive throughout. Ended up taking pictures of teh dishes which I normally never do. I appreciate that the wine menu was tactfully discussed, no attempt to gudie us to the expensive end, a good recommendation. We were in the noisy area, not the romantic corner. Two rather large Americans with their partners drown some of our conversation but cant blame the restaurant for that
5
Very good meal in a very nice restaurant. Food was good as usual, although it was on the pricey side (as expected).
5
Very cozy restaurant in a gorgeous colonial mansion. we had the Botanic menu and the signature onions 5 ways. The service was exceptional !
4
We really enjoyed the set menus. I had the Botanic vegetarian menu which looked inviting, with the signature 4 way onion.
5
From the nice setting in botanic gardens to the décor of the bungalow to the food, everything was great. There are several sets to choose from, and we had the 4 course business luncheon. Presentation was great and the food was fresh and tasty.
4
Inside the relaxation and green surrounding of Singapore Botanic Garden, the fine foods served in the right potion with good presentation. Very attentive and excellent services.

Corner House is a Michelin star restaurant housed in an old black and white colonial bungalow known as the EJH Corner House in the Singapore Botanical Gardens. The nearest gate is the gate off Evans Road near the visitors center. If you get lost, call the restaurant and they'd send a buggy to pick you up from the gate. We had lunch. For set lunch - there is a choice of a business lunch 3 or 4 courses (S$58++ or SS$68++) and a more elaborate Lunch Discovery Menu - 5 courses at S$128++.The foie gras was not seared and was served with Spanish ham. It was very creamy and spread well on warm bread. The Hungarian Mangalitsa Pork was melt-in-your-mouth fabulous. I really liked Chef's 'interpretation' of kaya toast - it would not have been anything you'd associate with kaya toast. Totally brilliant! I'd like to go back for dinner some time! Highly recommended for a quiet relaxing lunch
5
Enjoyed dinner with 3 others on Aug 4, 2016 at Corner House .. we enjoyed the innovative meal, the attentive service and the ambience. We were most surprised by the dessert which gave the meal a very nice finish. Would like to go back there for lunch so as to enjoy the beautiful Singapore Botanic Gardens.
4
A Friday lunch course which was creative, pretty and most importantly delectable! We had a leisurely lunch with great selection of aperitif and wines, beautifully selected by the sommelier. If you have the chance for special occasion to pick the most private corner table for 2, will need to book in advance. I prefer having lunch here vs dinner purely for the Botanic garden view
5
Pleasantly set in the midst of Singapore Botanic Gardens. Ordered its degustation menu with one of us having special dietary request. The kitchen fully delivered our orders to our satisfaction. Freshest ingredients were used and the taste was sublime that our conversations on the meal continued till the rest of the evening! The 2 main courses of cod fish with crispy scales and the A4 Japanese beef were done to amazing perfection. Wine pairing was appropriate for each dish although the pouring staff could have done more to introduce the wine better instead of just rattling off the information from the label. Nevertheless truly deserving of its one Michelin star that it clinched recently. Taste to believe
5
Prior to the restaurant receiving it's accorded Michelin star, I had the opportunity of dining here! I must say that I really liked where the restaurant is located at, although it may not be the easily accessible. I liked the fact that it makes you feel at peace, away from all the hustle and bustle. The food here is amazing! It is a diner truly worthy of it accolades and definitely a place I will return for. A MUST-TRY restaurant if you haven't already been there. You wouldn't regret it.
4
Since the restaurant is located in Botanics Garden, it gives the perfect environment. Very beautiful and very greeny. The food is well worth the price.
5
It was a birthday celebration with my husband. The food is amazing and the environment is cozy. I like every single dish, especially the Australian beef. BTW, the salted egg macaroon is also a must try.
5
The food, the ambiance, the service... Was truly end to end an "experience"... Delighted and rank it amongst my TOP 10 meals.
1
Went there recently for my birthday dinner. Although the house is beautiful sad to say I can't say the same for the food. The only good part of the whole set dinner was the sorbet. The food is bland and under seasoned. Chef is more interested in using fancy cooking techniques than the quality of the food
5
This was my first time going to an Asian Top 50's Restaurants. Being curious and because of its location (located inside the Botanic Garden), I made a booking well in advance before leaving Hong Kong. Due to misunderstanding of taking off taxi at 1 Cluny Road, we walked all the way from the Main Gate to the restaurant, which was over 1km away. Stupid me that the restaurant located immediate next to the Nassim Gate exit, and if we went to the correct gate, we could save the over 1km walk. We did not have negative feeling as indeed all the way was a scenic walk. Luckily that day the weather was fine and no rain. The restaurant was inside of cottage and we was assigned a table next to the windows on 1/F. The view was not very good as the cottage was completely surrounded by tall trees. We chose the business set lunch (either 3 courses or 4 courses). The foods were served in an impressive presentation and were delicious. Nothing to complain with and would highly recommend to friends who come over to SG
5
What a lovely place! We sat on the small glassed-in porch, which is like sitting outside (except more comfortable). Service is fine but too rushed, especially given the care given to the food preparation and presentation.Cocktails were meh. The Botanical Menu (vegetarian - chosen because it sounded great, not because we are vegetarians) was ah-mazing. Varied, beautifully presented, delicious. The tomato and onion courses were particularly spectacular (yes: spectacular!). We will definitely dine here again.
4
The restaurant is in the Botanical Garden. 2 storey black and white house.Advisable to make reservation in advance. It is always full house for weekends. In-fact I did my booking 3 weeks in advanced. I had 5 course degustation set dinner. The price is very reasonable, but not the wine. Wine is quite ex. The portion is just right for us - Asian. For big eater, I'm not sure whether it is sufficient.Food + presentation: 4.2/5Service: 4/5Ambience: 4.5/
4
Make sure you have ample time for navigating if you didn't enter the gardens from Nassim Gate Entrance. Loved the setting, as if you were in a glass box in the middle of a lush forest. Food and service were great, if sometimes seeming to lack passion and sincerity, but it does leave you with space for private conversation. Visited on Saturday lunch and found the set menu to be of good value. Wines are pricey and they didn't offer cocktails (then, at least) so you may be a little stuck for beverage choices
5
From the outset the service, food and ambience could not be faulted. We had a magical family dinner and our only regret was not taking the 9 course menu. Compared to some Michelin starred restaurants in Asia this restaurant exceeds the standards set by those restaurants. Each course was better than the last and we can highly recommend a visit to this restaurant when in Singapore
5
Birthdays always give you reasons to splurge on fine dining. This time it was Corner House. The idea that the restaurant was once a bungalow located in our beautiful Botanic Gardens already appealed to me. Definitely a place for a romantic night out or celebratory purpose for small group because of the old charming vibe. I only wish the tables were further apart as we could hear conversations from surrounding tables. Now for the food. I must say it was quite a gastronomic experience for me and my family. Comer House won't be in the Asia's 50 best restaurants for no reasons. The Chef Jason Tan uses herbs and botanical elements in the cuisine to the best creativity. I thought the carabinero prawns with the various seasonal tomatoes were interesting to the palate as the tomatoes were infused with herb juices like basil. My favourite was the Maine Lobster with risotto and buckwheat - the grains were crisp and chewy and of course fresh lobster. The A4 beef, though juicy and tender, was on the fatty side - so for the health conscious, you will be better off opting for the cod. By the time we reached the Chocolat "Earl Grey", we were quite full but for Earl Grey lovers, the Chocolat was heavenly. We didn't go for wine pairing but we ordered our own champagne and wine. Both were great selections and you can be spoiled for choices for wine. I must add a note on the breads - tasty raisin walnut breads, French baguette and the unforgettable "ham chim bang" aka croissant; so special you want more. Service staff was attentive and polite and tried to explain the dishes, but because of neighbouring conversations, I had some difficulty hearing but all forgivable. They presented me a lovely chocolate cake for my birthday - I was overjoyed. Overall it was an awesome culinary experience and I think the restaurant deserves to be awarded in the Michelin Guide Singapore 2016. The Chef is a thorough bred Singaporean and it is truly amazing for him to have come this far. For his originality, clever combination of ingredients, and fine craft - I will support a Singaporean for the Michelin stars
4
Should improve on menu creativity, as we had three different flavours of sorbet in our 5 course. Overall was fantastic experience. Thank u
4
Great location and atmosphere. Wine pairing choices were ok to very good. Food was solid, but not outstanding. For example, their A4 beef was tough and gristle in too many places.
5
I'm very pleased with all the dishes. The cooking was perfect and the way the sauces and sides blend with the mains was really marvellous. One of the best set meals I have ever had!
5
In a city like Singapore, it's hard to find a tranquil setting for a quiet dinner. The charm of the Corner House is that it's set in the middle of the Botanic Gardens in a beautiful black and white house. The ambience is wonderful, the service is impeccable and the food is even better...the wine-pairing which my wife chose adds to the experience.Some suggestions for improvement: First, dim the lights and add candles to the table. It's meant to be a romantic setting so make the most of it. Secondly, kill the music...the beauty of the setting is to enjoy the sounds of the gardens.Thirdly, it's a shame that the verandah is enclosed but I guess open-air would dissuade many who are used to universal a/c.Would I go back? Absolutely - as soon as I've saved up enough
4
I've been here many times before it become Corner House and the location and building are of course still charming. The dining room itself could do with an upgrade (especially the bathrooms), a lick of paint, and please bring back table cloths, if only in the name of hygiene. The reception ladies downstairs were unsmiling and, I found, unwelcoming. Other staff were polite, but there was no personal touch. Oh, and I hope you don't drink too much water - $15++ a bottle is quite the ask. This part of the experience was somewhat disappointing to be honest. The food, however, was good, especially considering the $68 set lunch menu price. In particular the 'modern twist' on the kaya toast was spectacular. And they have Bordier butter - hooray
5
Good Food! Very good quality ingredients. Atmosphere is quiet except for little chatters from other group diners can be heard from another section ion the room. However, the staff is discern enough to put us in a quieter cosy corner. It was my last minute reservations that I would think the staff did not put me in the balcony view as it was already being reserved. I told the receptionist that it was my wife's birthday and she told me that ordering a cake would take at least 3 days to prepare. Hence they were able to write a Happy birthday note on the dessert dish instead. I thought that was a nice gesture.
4
The setting is great, a lovely cottage in UNESCO listed Botanical Gardens. One can easily forget one is in the middle of urban Singapore.The food was well presented. However the flavours could be more complex.I had to ask for water refill as the many waiters did not observe my empty glass.If Michelin came here, possibly one star or a Bib
4
Came here one evening for a private corporate dinner, around 30 people. Great venue to host drinks and dinner for an event. We had a 3 course meal, and I really enjoyed the pork main course and the dessert. Service a little bit rough, but the venue and food were great
5
I had been here for lunch before and it was forgettable . For dinner however it was Excellent. Buggy ride to take us to and fro from visitor Centre so no need to walk in the heels. Ambience is beautiful in this old colonial house. It seemed to be all locals so quiet. Every plate was a beautiful piece of art. The starter with the tomato some many styles was very refreshing. My favourite dish of the night from the degustation menu was the lobster risotto with grains from barley and buckwheat. All in all perfect night out.
5
This beautiful restaurant is a cool oasis in very steamy Singapore. Situated in the Botanical Gardens, it has a large glassed in verandah with comfortable, air conditioned seating, as well as another dining room inside. The three course set menu for lunch was superb, with great choices for each course. Our prawn entree was inspired as was our main of Patagonian tooth fish, served with Harissa foam and pumpkin purÃ©e. To top it off we chose the Japanese cucumber sorbet, a refreshing and delicious way to finish the meal. Chef Tan is innovative and creative, a must visit in Singapore
5
We went for our wedding anniversary. We loved it and we'll definitely repeat.
The chef surprised us in each dish with unexpected flavours.
5
Excellent service beautiful view. The food is served in style. The staffs attended to us politely snd explained tbe courses to us professionally.
5
This restaurant is superb and innovative. Incidentally I did meet Jason Tan to congratulate him. The food and location both are sublime.
4
We were a group of 10 for regular lunch plus special announcements of engagement and first grandchild. So our mood was upbeat. The charm of the place is the greenery of this lovely park and this gem of an old residence. I'd say it is decorated simply.The food and service were great. I had a shrimp starter, fish as main and cucumber sorbet. The fish was superb. The sorbet was too light and minimal for my tastes. The starter was beautifully presented and tasty
5
I made a reservation at 6.30pm. We arrived at 6.29pm and waited for about 5-10mins before we were ushered into the restaurant. We had a greatly positioned dining table for 2 right at the corner, with me facing the 'nature' behind my boyfriend. The menu comprised of 3 different sets. No ala carte option is available. Looking through all the menu, we picked the 4 course set and 2 glasses of rose wine.As we were chatting halfway, I spotted a squirrel climbing up and down the tree right behind my boyfriend! It was so adorable! That's the excitement of dining in the 'woods'.BF ordered Carabinero prawn with variation of best season tomato, vintage sheery and Kirstal de Chine caviar. As I am allergic to prawn, I only tasted the tomato and caviar. I love the presentation of the dish using Chef Jason Tan's personalized plate. Oh and the caviar was DELICIOUS!I ordered 3 artichoke salade with Violet, Jerusalem, crosnes, cured duck, Riesling, grapes, hazelnut, black truffle. Yes BLACK TRUFFLE!! My appetizer was simply fantastic! BF even mentioned that he would pick this instead of Carabinero prawn which costs $22++ more! Both of us selected Oignon doux des Cévennes, 62 degree egg, buckwheat, noisette crouton, as our starter. The first mouth tasted heavenly! Almost every other table took this dish as the starter too. As this was a little creamy, I got slightly 'sick' of it when I was about to finish. Nevertheless, it was nearly perfect.Again, we decided to go for the same dish for our main - Japanese A4 Toriyama beef with horseradish, macadamia, black radish, shallot and soy caramel; medium rare for me and medium for him. Love the marbling of the beef! The main dish was up to our expectation. Thumbs up (Y)!BF ordered My Kaya Toast (Pandan, coconute, gula melaka, muscovado sablé and pineapple) as his dessert and thankfully, the staff remembered my remark when I made the reservation - writing 'Happy Birthday' with a candle on his dessert dish. 10 points for Corner House.I laughed at him for ordering a Kaya Toast for his dessert and I was so wrong. My Kaya Toast was unbelievably amazing. I could never imagine that being a 'kaya toast'.I ordered Chocolat "Earl Grey yin zhen" with 40% Jivara, 70% Guanaja, yuzu, pistachio, kumquat. My dessert was yummy as well, still, My Kaya Toast wins it hands down.The portion for the 4 course dinner was just right! We were happily full but not full to the extent that we feel that our stomach may explode anytime soon which we experienced at some other restaurants.This was the most expensive meal I ever paid. Nonetheless, it was a memorable and delightful dining experience. Not only their food was exquisitely delectable, their service was exceptional. They paid attention to all little detail such as placing a cute tiny stool next to my chair for me to put my bag, pushing in my chair for me when I was first seated and even after I came back from the washroom. My boyfriend complained that they paid more attention to the female than the male as they only look at me when they were explaining the dishes. Everything was 'Ladies First' in the restaurant. Wahaha =D No doubt, we would love to return in the future. Maybe we would give their lunch menu a try soon
5
Had the full 8 course degustation menu with some friends which was very enjoyable. The chef's interpretation of his favorite vegetable - onion - was out of the world. Best ~60 degree egg with truffle and onion that I ever had among all the fine dining restaurants I have been to (Odette, Jaan etc)Most of the dishes were well executed but there were also some misses like the lamb..tasted average but plating was somewhat distracting. Nonetheless, this was a great meal, and as a fellow Singaporean, I'm very proud that the chef was a local down to earth Singaporean who worked his way up the culinary food chain.
2
A very disappointing dinner at Corner House. We were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary and whilst the food was okay, and in some ways inventive, the service was terrible for this category of fine -dining restaurant, even by Singapore standards.It started badly as we waited 10 minutes for a menu to appear; wine glasses were seldom topped-up without asking; cutlery was provided after dishes were served and coffee was served without milk. It turned out that there was no maitre'd on duty (Saturday) and when I offered some feedback at the end of the meal the waiter just told me he would pass this on.At $250 per head this restaurant must do bette
5
We went to Corner House recently for dinner. I had requested for a quiet table and was grateful to have a table at a corner away from the main section where there were some lively customers on this evening.The food was really delightful. The botanical elements of the cuisine came through fresh, wholesome and flavourful. The seafood and meat were also delicious. The "botanica" dish was innovative and delectable, bringing out the authentic tastes. Chef Tan's interpretation of the Cévennes onion was exhilarating and such a treat with the experience enhanced by the accompanying creative and informative mini booklet. The dessert was nice and endearing. Even some of the petit fours were infused with botanical flavours. It is not often that botanicals are given such prominence in a menu and I welcomed that. The recommended wines were good and service was great.It was indeed a lovely dinner at the corner
3
Great environment and setting, great service, great display design of the plates and food but:- wine is far too expensive, would call it a scam, 2-3 times more than in any other Asian or European countries which is not acceptable. Who wanna pay SGD35-40 for one glass of standard wine!- food taste was quite bland and common, just nothing special enough for being called fine dinning;- overall too expensive, no value for money though it is a beautiful old restaurant in a nice setting at botanic garden.In other words, you just pay for a nice environment but not worth what we paid: SGD700 for 2 pax with wine pairing
5
Fantastic lunch - the quality of the food matched the atmosphere. Beautiful garden greenery all round the restaurant and really good quality, delicious, skillfully well prepared, well put together fine-dining that did not come across as pretentious or trying too hard . the soft shell crab starter and pork jowl main were excellent. service just needs to be warmer , and then the restaurant can truly become one of the best around. a really excellent, wonderful lunch
5
Staff were friendly and attentive to our request of a nice view seating, and even decorated the dessert plate with birthday well wishes for my boyfriend. Food was amazing as well!
5
we had a beautiful and very special dinner at the corner house. We had the Gastronomic 4 course menu with wine pairing and every single thing on every plate was surprising, delicious and just so special. The staff were very attentive but a little too quick at explaining all the detail on the plates - but maybe because there is so much detail on every plate. It did not go unnoticed. Every element on the plate had so much care and detail and the flavours were so abundant and complementary. One of my best dining experiences in SG
5
The restaurant is inside the Botanical Garden and the setting is very nice and relaxing.We had the business lunch menu and the tasting menu. The food is well prepared and the presentation is very pretty.After we parked the car, we called the restaurant and they arranged a golf cart to pick us up. Otherwise, it would be a long walk under the sun.I think the full tasting menu is too much food for lunch so the business luncheon menu would be sufficient
5
Came here for a birthday dinner - we were seated at the balcony area which was airconditioned, yet surrounded by greenery. The atmosphere was classy and romantic - really nice. Food was amazing as well, I like how my fiancee and I could have different menus (I had the 5-course and she had the 4-course menu) which let us try more dishes without feeling too full. Loved the beef and cod main courses - mains are usually underwhelming at many restaurants, but Corner House's was amazing. The lobster in the lobster risotto was also succulent and delicious. Overall a fantastic meal
4
We tried the Gastronomic set that comes with Carabinero prawn, Austrian white asparagus, free range chicken and Maine lobster, or New Zealand cod, and to finish off with chocolat Earl Grey yin zhen. The server was mindful to separate the cavier for my wife the second time around knowing that she's allergic to anything raw. Kudos to the server and her attentiveness. The place is pleasant, but kind of pricey.
4
Overall ambience is good especially the tranquility of the location. And even despite it was raining, there was a personal ride with the golf car back to the carpark area.The dish that's worth mentioning was the cucumber sorbet and the artichoke salad. The rest seems quite mediocre.There was several hiccups though:delay in clearing up the bread crumps on table; serving the wrong dish to the wrong person; had to ask the waiter for more bread.Otherwise the food is pretty decent and value.If those areas could be improved on, it may become one of the top tier restaurants in the regio
2
Food was terribly over priced and food would arrive cold. No wow factor, and for the fact that we spent. $430 all up for 2x 4 course meal including one glass of champagne, our expectations were most certainly not me
4
It was a dinner for my partner's birthday celebration. There were 3 degustation menus to choose from. Unfortunately, my partner has a small appetite hence I couldn't go for the bigger menu. We chose the 4-course. I wanted to try their beef dish and that was not in the 4-course menu. Fortunately, they allowed me to order that with a supplement $. Overall, the food was good, not superb, My beef dish was a little disappointing as it was a bit tough and it was some effort to saw the meat with the knife. My partner enjoyed his lobster & chicken dish. It was fresh! One big disappointment was the portion size of each dish. For a 4-course menu, I expected the portion to be bigger but it didn't seem to be the case. Advice for new diners - order the 5-course at least
4
The Corner house is a beautiful restaurant inside the botanic gardens. The food presentation is amazing: we ordered a tasting menu and every dish was a piece of art. I found everything really delicious. The service staff is very attentive and competent, but could be more friendly. I had the opportunity to meet chef Jason, who has been very nice to us.
1
This is positioning itself as a premium restaurant. There are a few ways it lives up to that: the location is great, the wine list is extensive, the food is original and looks nice - and the price is in line with some of the world's most expensive restaurants.However, there is a big gap vs other similarly-prices restaurants: the service was very poor (not attentive, not thoughtful), the ability to customise dishes for a vegetarian was poor, and the taste of the food was only ok.Overall disappointing
4
Corner House has an impressive garden setting that is always a pleasure to visit. The food is good too. Only the lukewarm service mars my visits. They are efficient but come across cold.
5
I had the most memorable business lunch ever at the Corner House! High quality ingredients cooked to perfection and exceptional creativity in a colonial building in green surroundings. Add skilled staff and a bunch of friends....life is good.
5
Great business lunch !Fantastic surroundings,great food ,good service.You forget you are in the middle of a work day.The verandah is a wonderful spot..the 3 course menu was the highlight.
5
I asked for a great view seat given this occasion was to celebrate my daddy who I only get to see once a year. I didn't even ask but was presented with a lovely "Happy Bday" dessert which was very thoughtful and kind. Thank you team
5
Very comfortable with no silly "dress code". As long as you are clean and not wearing flip flops you are warmly welcomed. A very smart move as the restaurant is set in a lovely park that is just perfect for a stroll before dinner. Set menu's only with no room for modification unless you have food allergies. But with many menu's to choose from and lots of choices on the set menu's, it was no problem to find something for everyone. One of the best meals I've had in a long time. Fantastic vegetables, great flavors and REAL FOOD! Very expensive wine menu. Hard to find something under 200S$. Service was impeccable. After five courses, we will stuffed unlike other high end restaurants where we you want a pizza after dinner. Jason is a very imaginative chef and also responsible in souring of healthy product. YEAH! No farmed salmon on this menu! He deserves much better than 17 place in Pellegrino awards
4
Came here for valentines dinner and was not disappointed. The food here is very good and the atmosphere here is romantic and is good for special occasions. There is a decent selection of wines and should you want to bring a special wine from home they do offer 1 for 1. The only downside is that there is no smoking in the botanical gardens so should you need a puff during your meal then you would have some problems. A tip is to call the restaurant when you arrive at the main gate of the gardens (or car park) and they will pick you up in the golf buggy. Would I come back again -? Yes.
5
We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday and everything ( food, service, ambience) was wonderful. A small feedback point - s member of our party relied on the map on your website and found herself driving up and down Tyersall Avenue. Perhaps you could include directions if they are not already posted. Thank you.
4
Service was very prompt, even our reservation was confirmed without us having to call the restaurant. We took the 3 course set menu - Tempura Soft Shell Crab, Wagyu Beef strips and my dessert was the Poached Pear. Food was yummy except the cutlery could be improved as the knife for the beef which was medium cut could not slice it with one stroke down. Tea/Coffee does not come with the set and these have to be ordered separately. All in all, very nice place for a leisurely lunch with lush greenery surroundings. Will definitely make another visit
5
My husband I went here for our wedding anniversary for Sunday Brunch and it was just lovely. We had a wonderful table on the verandah looking out to the beautiful botanical gardens. The staff were excellent and very efficient and knew the menu. The chef did a wonderful job. The food was faultless. It was simply was delicious. They added a personal touch by adding happy anniversary on our dessert plate. Highly recommend for a special occasion or if you want to treat yourself to some delicious food
5
Gastro-botanica cuisine. Both times we were there, each dish arrived beautifully plated. Go early while it is still light out so that you can enjoy the greenery. Take a short walk in the Botanic Gardens before dinner so that you can appreciate how well this restaurant ties in with the surroundings. Wine list is extensive, and a smaller curated list of mocktails and cocktails. My mojita was one of the better ones I have had, and the house red was lightly floral and easy on the palate. Our starter of flounder, uni and black truffle was outstanding. And the cevanne onion soup was just so good. Dessert didn't disappoint too - both times, it arrived pretty as a picture. Worth the trip, and especially good for special occasions.
4
The food is nice, service is good, wine pairings are good, the location and ambience is nice to, but somehow it doesnt sparkle as much as it should at this kind of places
5
Outstanding cuisine in an environment with a fascinating history. Beautifully presented dishes with flavours to match served by a quietly efficient and friendly staff.
4
Very warm service only the location is not that easy to find. The food is really good... I will like to visit again soon..
5
Had a wonderful Valentine's Day Lunch, with a special tasting menu mainly of seafood. Beautifully presented and diverse flavors with wonderful micro-herbs, Staff was excellent and the chef was flexible to adjust the tasting menu for non-seafood eaters, so very accommodating. Restaurant is in an old colonial home with wonderful windows and air-conditioning. Recommend if you can set in balcony area, which is also temperature controlled.
5
This is a really cool restaurant located in the Botanical gardens but with ample parking close by. The service was most professional but not over done. As it was lunch time we ordered from the restricted menu which is varied and has something to suit most palates. The foie gras although not a large portion was delicious and my Australian wagyu beef was cooked to perfection. The Japanese cucumber desert was different yet very tasty.All in all a very memorable lunch and we will definitely return for dinner in the near future.Booking in advance is a must and we had to wait for approximately one month to get a lunch booking due to the restaurant's popularity
4
My good mate invited me for my breakfast treat. He asked me to meet him corner house. What ? Which one? Lots of corner houses around I told him. In the end, he told me it's a restaurant @ botanical gardens.Oh boy! Omg ! I was most impressed with the surroundings, the ambience, the service, n most importantly, good food n good wines.I decided to go for a 4 courses @ $58. Beautiful ! Three courses at $48 & there's a degustation menu at $98 too.I would return to this place again soon. Apparently, our PM invited the president of China n his wife during their recent visit to lunch here at the main dinning hall.Two words to sum it up .... Cool bananas or simply awesome. Give it a GO. You will be most impressed.

Went there for a special occasion and was pleasantly surprised that Corner House surpassed its predecessor Au Jardin by the Les Amis group.Chef Jason Tan's fusion focussed on quality yet does not neglect the presentation. The simple but elegant presentation style using botanics is tasteful and endearing. I am delighted to discover that there is a leaf that actually replicates the taste of oysters!What marred the evening though was the lackluster service. When you go for fine dining and a special evening, you do not expect to be rushed through the courses. The super efficient staff here could not wait to remove my plates the moment I finish my last morsel and put my fork down. Even though we tried to slow down each course, they didn't get the hint. We finished our 5 courses and tea well under 90minutes - a record. Secondly the staff did not bother to clear the crumbs from the bread before starting service proper and that's rather unsightly. And finally, I find the senior wait staff tend to hang too close to the diners for comfort. They should learnt to observe from further afield. Thankfully, the well thought out and well executed menu overcome the service deficiencies. We will be back but hopefully they can improve on the service standards to make every diner's experience a wonderful one.

The corner house hotel, sitting within the Singapore botanic Gardens, is one of the most elegant restaurants and best meal I ever have had. The surrounding is beautiful, in the old governors house surrounded by the trees and flowers of the botanic Garden. We sat on the second floor with a large window looking out at the trees. It could not have been more peaceful or beautiful. And then there's the food. The menu is a set menu with three options. We opted for the first menu which was a choice of a starter, and appetizer, main course, and a dessert. But then they were extras all the way along. First there was the bread which was some of the most delicious bread. I often judge a restaurant by its bread and the corner house definitely passed. We were then treated to two small bites of beautifully presented things that I cannot even describe. We were five people and we all got different things. I opted for the three types of artichoke salad, with black truffle, cured duck, and hazelnuts. My husband had Japanese buri oh which was texture of cucumber, with diacon and sea urchin. My husband followed that with cuttlefish while I had an egg with 3 different variations on onion. It was absolutely magnificent in my mouth. This was followed by the main course. For me that was beef that was more tender than butter and literally melted in my mouth. Before dessert we were treated to an intermezzo of a pear and ice purée that was delicious enough to be dessert. But no, there was still dessert to follow. And if that wasn't enough, we were presented with a gift box of cookies on our way out. I have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world and this was indeed one of the best. My complements to the chef.

Set in a "black and white" colonial home of a British botanist, in the famous Botanic gardens of Singapore. - Food is a fusion of international cuisine, and the chef's Singaporean taste accents. -I can say this iss the best food in Singapore. Food presntation is first class. Bright sunny and luxurious ambience - excellent for an undisturbed lunch or intimate dinner. - Service is friendly and sophisticated

On a hot and humid day in Singapore, I unexpectedly sat down to one of the best meals of my life. I was in town for a few days off the back of a crazy three days cruising the high seas with Royal Carribean. I’d deliberately not made plans – I wanted to enjoy my first time in the city at my own pace. Which is just as well, because when a last minute invite popped up to have lunch at the Corner House, I had no place else to be.Set amongst the lush green palm trees of Singapore’s Botanic Gardens, the Corner House is a restaurant that pays homage to its surrounds with a menu that celebrates the plant kingdom. Described by chef and co-owner Jason Tan as ‘gastro-botanica’, the contemporary cuisine gives equivalent weight on the plate to protein and botanical elements.The two-story black and white bungalow where the restaurant resides was built in 1910 and was once the home of leading botanist E J H Corner who was the Assistant Director of the Botanic Gardens from 1929 to 1945. E J H Corner is basically one of the most interesting men you’ll ever hear about. Story has it he developed the use of ‘botanical monkeys’ to fetch botanical specimens from tall forest trees.We jumped straight into everything this gastro-botanica menu had to offer with the eight-course ‘Discovery Experience’ degustation menu. At S$248 per head, it’s a pretty reasonable investment for one of the best meals of your life.The team at the Corner House describe the features gastro-botanica as “exquisitely prepared food that distils and sharpens the essential flavour and character of ingredients. The meats, poultry and seafood used are fastidiously sourced and chosen; and botanicals, in particular, are given prominence. By giving greater weight to the preparation of these botanicals, gastro-botanica cuisine achieves a delicate balance between the main ‘protein’ element and the garnishing on the plate. Flavours are animated with subtle and precise layering to build up ‘momentum’.”The pièce de résistance of this delicious degustation is ‘The Onion Revealed’ – an interpretation of Chef Jason Tan’s favourite vegetable. Best described as a four-iteration mini degustation within the degustation, ‘The Onion Revealed’ requires 2kgs of Cevennes onion (a very expensive French variety that is superbly sweet without pungency) per guest.1. Baked Onion CupA whole onion, baked and hollowed, is filled with onion puree and confit, a 62°C sous-vide egg, sea salt, chives and black truffles.2. Onion TartOnion confit on crispy filo pastry, topped with parmesan cheese. The confit is made from thin hand-sliced onions slow-cooked in butter for six hours.3. Onion ChipA thin slice of onion is dehydrated for 24-hours, then lightly salted to bring its delicate flavours to the fore.4. Onion TeaThe teacup holds an emulsion of onion confit and cream. Earl Grey-infused onion tea is poured on it, creating a duality of sensations. The onion tea is the most expensive of components as 3kgs of onions and two days work produce a mere 200ml.Now I’ve seen some good plating in my time, but at the Corner House, it’s exceptional. Chef Jason Tan has his ceramics custom-made to suit each dish, making the dishes almost too beautiful to eat.When it came to the dessert component of the degustation, we were blown away. The first sweet dish we were presented with looked like a boiled egg in an egg cup, but with a delicious edible chocolate shell. Little touches throughout the degustation like gender specific egg cups for each guest was super cute. I tried to get a photo of my friends and mine with the dessert intact, but clearly I wasn’t fast enough.From the moment you walk through the door of this historical location, you’ll feel the life work of E J H Corner permeating throughout every aspect of the restaurants concept. After teaching himself to draw and illustrate, his now-classic botanical illustrations have been recreated and line the walls and various touch points throughout the restaurant like these detailed coasters.TIL Tip:Sunday brunch at the Corner House in an institution, and with such a beautiful tropical setting, it’s great to experience the restaurant during the day. With four delicious courses for S$68 it’s exceptional value, so make sure you book in advance

Pre Christmas dinner, very lovely music, romantic ambience, good n promptly service. Food is awesome, especially the seabass and Wagyu beef, 178++ per person for 5 course set menu

great place with delicious food.. only lacking is to find some customers with slippers and totally floppy. i do understand is biz, gv them a pair of shoes or stand by ur dress code pls.

Enjoyed Sunday brunch. Location is very nice within gardens. Menu selections are limited. It is a nice old Black & White Colonial house which as been preserved.
5
The food, ambience and service are unarguably top-notch! Definitely will come back again soon! Highly recommended :)

- Set in the refurbished residence of a British botanist.- Food is a mix of international haute-cuisine, and the chef's uniquely Singaporean takes.- Full marks for ambience - excellent for an undisturbed lunch or intimate dinner.- Service is distinctly average.- Best to drive here, it's quite a walk from the public transport
4
Had a business lunch here. We chose the three course set lunch priced at $48++. The four course set lunch is at $58++.Ambience and view is great when you get the seats near the balcony. The salmon trout appetizer is really good. I have the wagyu main which you need to top up $9 and exotic dessert. Food is great. A pity they do not provide free coffee or tea to end the meal nicely.

I came here for lunch with my family for my birthday and wanted to treat my family to a nice fine-dining lunch without the heavy price tag that is usually associated for dinner. Upon arriving at the botanical gardens, the restaurant called if we wanted a buggy to pick us up at the front entrance of the visitor centre, we were pleasantly surprised and we agreed. Soon enough, a buggy whisked us away to the restaurant, only to realise it was very very near (100m?) and we could have easily walked the distance. The ambience was nice in the old black and white colonial bungalow and we had to climb a flight of stairs to the dining area. (I think this is not so convenient for anyone elderly.) In the dining area, it actually felt quite cramped and the they tried to make the best of their space there. I guess the better seats were the ones near the windows where you get a better view of the lovely gardens. I ordered the 5 course degustation menu and a bottle of wine. The sommelier was nice enough to recommend a bottle of red which we enjoyed with our food. He was quite pleasant in his explanations and always had a smile. As the dishes started arriving, we were blown away with the presentation and the flavours, though admittedly, the portions were all very small. I think the best dish was the scallop carpaccio. The biggest let down was how the waitresses all had gloomy faces and every time we asked for something, like a slice of lime, or more ice in our water, they had a black face. Even though we mentioned that we were celebrating my birthday dinner, there was not the slightest congratulatory wish from the staff. I don't think that was to respect our privacy, but it was like the waitresses didn't care at all.I left the restaurant disappointed as I was really looking forward to a memorable meal at corner house. Unfortunately, I remember it for the wrong reasons and the service by the waitresses was really a let down
3
Loved the location in the black and white bungalow for my hubbys birthday lunch. However we were stuck in a corner and had to constantly gesture for service staff attention.. they were held up with other regular customers. Food was great, but not as good as Jaan or other high end for the price.

We've had both Lunch and Dnner at this little house ( former residence of the Asst. Botanical Gardens Director & Botanist, EJH Corner)located near the Visitors Taxi & Bus drop off gate...Both times, the Chef gave us exciting, inspirational food that tasted like any Michelin Chef might deliver ( although, Michelin doesn't yet rate Singaporean restaurants.). Pricey, but worth it, as the food uses local ingredients and highlights the Botanical Gardens with colors and tastes from some of the plants and flowers. Wine is expensive, but the list is excellent. Diners can choose between 4-7 course set menues and the Staff is flexible about substitutions for a given course.Service is totally appropriate and we were made to feel special amd welcome here..Although we didn't rank amongst some recent diners....as this is where PM Lee hosted Presidents of China ( Xi) & Taiwan (Ma) for a luncheon marking the first such meeting of these two Heads of States in over 60 years!If you can't make " peace" in this Garden of Eden, then perhaps they should include more wine next meeting!Wonderful food...wonderful environment....highly recommended for a romantic meal

It’s a ‘five’ for the ambience and furnishing of Corner House, which is named after E J H Corner, the assistant Director at the Singapore Botanic Gardens (1926-1946) and Professor of Tropical Botany at University of Cambridge (1965-1973). Certainly, this restaurant has ‘housed’ part of the botanist’s life story in Singapore, which cannot be repeated. Dining in the veranda rather than in the main dining area adds to the dining experience and is recommended.Food is fine for the restaurant of this class. It offers a variety of dishes with exotic ingredients. My favorite is the salmon appetizer served with sesame oil, avocado cream, and topped with legumes. However, I do prefer my medium-sized shrimps (main course) to be deveined (although I am also aware of the fact that most cooks do not bother deveining medium-sized or smaller shrimps). I will give an average point for service as I do not find it particularly outstanding or friendly
5
Very good service and hospitality. The staff are well trained and we felt extremely well taken care of. Each signature dish by the Chef was explained and we relished the food served. They have a variety of wines too on their menu.
5
A jewel box in the Botanic Gardens. Exceptional fusion cuisine with local tastes and flavors reinterpreted in spectacular fashion. And an exceptional wine list for all occasions.m
3
Food was good in general. The cod was excellent. However, the waitress is not very friendly and tend to mumble to herself and i have no idea what she is saying when she is introducing the dishes. However i feel that it does not feel like a $174 meal as I've had better food of the same western style at <$100. The portions could have been bigger
5
We found the Corner House restaurant by accident at lunch time while visiting the botanical gardens with friends. A beautiful colonial house in a tropical setting.Amazing food with a choice of 3,4 or 5 courses at a good price for lunch. Each dish was visually stunning, full of subtle flavours and explained by the staff. Well worth a visit
4
Nested amongst the gardens of the Botantic Gardens, the food served up by Corner House reflects that environment. We had dinner there and many of the courses incorporated elements of flowers and was always colourful. Almost all the courses were good to excellent although I was surprised the chicken main course was the least impressive, both visually and taste-wise.Service was excellent as was the ambience. The wines were rather expensive though

For more reviews and photos, visit my site hungrybaker.coWandering around the Botanic Gardens in the dark is no fun, but it can have a delicious ending if you’re going for dinner at Corner House. The two-storey colonial bungalow is beautifully furnished in shades of grey and has a washroom with open windows and a view from the second storey.On to the food! We tried the four-course dinner menu ($98). There is a six-course option ($148) as well.To start, we were given amuse bouches and bread. For the appetisers, we had the Hokkaido scallop and French royale oyster. The French royale oyster was a fascinating dish, from the mist created by the dry ice to the flavours, but I prefer a fresh, plump and juicy oyster highlighted with just a splash of lemon instead of muffled with toppings.For starters, we had the New Zealand cod “Crispy Scales” and Oignon doux des Cévennes. The New Zealand cod “Crispy Scales” highlighted an interesting technique, but tastewise, was average. My companion could not stop exclaiming about the Oignon doux des Cévennes, 62 degree egg, buckwheat, noisette croúton, which I have to agree was really good.For the main, I ordered the Free range chicken, foie gras, romanesco, sauce. I would not order foie gras if I had a choice, but I didn’t eat the other option offered. I must say the fattened liver was perfectly cooked, although I would have preferred more textures to contrast with the sous vide chicken. We were given a palate cleanser before desserts. We had My interpretation of kaya toast and Durian BB Pudding.My interpretation of kaya toast was good, but I don’t having to combine so many separate components. I really enjoyed the Durian BB Pudding, kopi ice cream, caramel, evaporated milk anglaise. It looked like a cute overgrown mushroom, the flavours went well together and I kept wanting more.To end the meal, we had salted egg yolk macarons, which were unusual and quite good. Despite the “Happy Birthday” piping, we were charged for them, which is strange as most restaurants usually offer something complimentary for diners celebrating a birthday.I think one could leave Corner House either impressed or finding it just average, depending on the dishes ordered. With the amuse bouches, palate cleanser and cookies to bring home in a tin, I think $98 for the meal is not exorbitant. I do look forward to trying it again when the menu is updated, though some dishes would be missed if replaced
4
Another great lunch, even though that butter is still placed on the table without any cover, which I find unhygienic. Even more unhygienic were the Maitre D's super long finger nails, somebody please get him a manicure voucher. They were clean, but not something I expect in that level of restaurant
5
The Corner House is set in the Botanical gardens in Singapore in a special old house, converted into a wonderful restaurant.The food complements the setting , and a wonderful ambience and excellent service complete the package.Inventive modern food with a superb wine list - we ordered Chateau Grillet from the Rhone - a special Viognier wine which was the perfect accompaniment to both the fish and pork.I was also tempted by the vintage armagnacs on offer .Well worth a visit 
4
Perhaps our expectations were set too high by the exquisite amuse bouche and delightful appetizers. The Yuzu Jelly on Leaves was the cutest and most refreshing amuse bouche I've ever see. The free range chicken for the main was fresh but looked so pale that we really felt quite sad for it. But the meal was saved by the dessert - really creamy kaya ice cream and crunchy biscuits. 
5
Celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary with a sumptuous dinner at Corner House.Having tasted 60 Michelin stars all over Europe, Corner House is definitely Michelin-star worthy! Impressed with Chef Jason Tan's attention to details and his fine execution of the intricate dishes which tasted as good as they look! Interesting injection of local flavours into fine dining! Thanks to Jason and his dedicated team for a wonderful dinner... Highly recommended
4
We loved the food and ambience. Good service too. The dishes were well presented. We had a lovely family bonding time.
5
Finding such excellent taste is not common in Sg and I found it here in Corner house where the chef's palate is exploding with a mixture of subtle flavours! Can't wait to be back again..
5
Beautiful colonial house in a lush environment. Wait staff was attentive and sent a buggy to pick us up from the botanic gardens entrance. The food was good. We love the place and so did our guest.
4
One of the finest brunch I ever had in town (also one of the pricier ones at $68++). Highly recommended for that special occation. Located at the gorgeous 100 year old EJH Corner House in the Singapore Botanic Gardens.
3
Atmosphere was great. However we found hair in my main course. Greatly disappointed and did not even want to have a replacement.
5
Allow a bit of extra time to get here as it is a little hidden and you will have to ask directions once inside the botanical gardens. However its worth the effort. The food was excellent with plenty of flavour, service attentive, wine decently priced and location, in an old "black and white" house, pretty unique. I'd definitely return
4
We held our solemnization followed by wedding reception at Corner House which had a great setting and cosy ambient. Both main chef Jason Tan and pastry chef Jason were amazing with their cooking culinary which delighted all our guests! Thank you to the Inah and Izzy in helping with the coordination and to the excellent service crew who were attentive. Cheers

One of the best dinners I've had in Singapore (food wise), food was beautifully presented and very tasty. My favourites were the scallops and the gula melaka dessert. Their wine list was quite extensive but overpriced in my opinion. I felt that the wine pairing was not that great- we've told the sommelier we did not like Chardonnay but he still served us one in the course. Service could do more work, some were excellent (2 of the 5 who served us) but most of them could improve. One instance they've offered my husband bread but not me?! When asked if we could be served some bread since the table who got in after us were already served and ours still hasn't reached the table the man just smirked! It was a great meal and cheers to the chef! It was lovely food but service needs to be improved as that kept our experience from being 5 star
3
We have dinned at this place both during lunch and dinner, and decided to have another go with our own bottle. I was sad that they charged $80++ for corkage (close to S$100) for the bottle we brough. A ridiculous policy that reflect the mentality of the co-owner who happen to be a wine merchant. It was a Wednesday night, and only 10 out of the 80-seat resturant were occupied (Resturant usually became less popular for some good reasons!). Service was below average for fine dining, and food was as expected. However, we would definitely give it a miss due to their unfriendly corkage policy that deters customers who like their own selection of wine
1
The prices are overrated and the host staff at the restaurant was not very accommodating. I went on a Tuesday when most of the park is closed. They had a hard time taking me saying the restaurant was busy. I went up to get seated only to find the place 25% occupied. They wanted to sit me inside. I left. It's probably the worst hostess experience I have ever witnessed.
5
Beautiful settings, fantastic food at a very good price for lunch. However: the wines by the glass are outrageously priced, I didn't think it's very hygienic to leave the butter to thaw on the table, and the toilets are boiling hot.
5
Very nice restaurant in the amazing Botanical gardens (a Unesco heritage site). Small scale, old colonial setting, great atmosphere and superb service
4
Was given a secluded quiet corner, chef Jason Tan's cooking excellent, and wife happy. What's more incredible was the owner was the sommelier for the night.
5
This was the culinary highlight of a recent trip to Singapore. Sitting amid the wonderful Botanical Gardens the venue evokes times past. Everything about it is tasteful, even the views of tropical vegetation. Truly special.The menu is short but varied. Service was just perfect and the food itself was fabulous. I never thought that the best piece of north Atlantic cod I would ever eat would be in a small restaurant in Singapore, but that is a fact
5
Even though a small menu, there is enough to cover all tastes. The food is simply divine and chef Jason Tan's attention to detail pays homage to the amazing quality of the ingredients. Standouts for me were the Onion three ways and the Japanese beef. The service is top class and reminds me of how service used to be before some restaurants started to consider the customer as a nuisance. Not so here - yes it is on the pricier end but this is a memorable evening that is well worth it

I love everything that i tasted during my visit with 6 other friends for a birthday celebration. However, i was expecting a little more after reading the reviews, so here are some disappointments which i hope corner house can work on. The set menus had limited choices and one of us wanted the 6 course meal. However, instead of 2 appetizers, we asked if we could have 2 desserts instead. Our request was turned down with no good reason why and we felt that it was not very wise as the dessert would have probably meant more profit (considering the food costs) for the restaurant and also more choices for the guests. Waiter also did not suggest ordering it ala carte, so we assume that we wouldn't be able to do so. The inflexibility from the beginning was a turn off as we were all there wanting to try food that we really want, but the set meals are just too restrictive. Considering a 50% full restaurant on a Friday night with more than sufficient wait staff, our service was considerably slow. It felt like only 1 person was working that day. I'd understand if the restaurant was packed but NO it was NOT. There was just a lot of waiting and asking for service, and i just wished the wait staff had more initiative. Lastly, some of my pet peeves that really turned me off includes:Waiter having a sip of wine at the service floor in front of us. (I am not saying you can't have a drink, but if you do, please don't do it in front of the customers.)Captain checking his own mobile phone at the service floor. Similarly, its not wrong, but just nor professional. No initiative to top up our water after we paid for the bill. It seems like service just STOPS after the bill was settled. For the amount of price we paid, which was close to $200/pax after the set meal and a few bottles of wine; i really felt the service was a let down. Kudos to the chef as everything we tasted was heavenly. Even as we left, the chef was at the door bidding us farewell and i think he was much more friendly than most of the wait staff serving us. Once in a lifetime experience and i will not be returning again although i miss the food

My best friend and I enjoyed a very interesting long lunch at Corner House this afternoon and both agreed that Corner House. We are both foodies and both great fans of the old Au Jardin (which used to be on the site of Corner House).Corner House's lunch menus consist of a 3/4 executive lunch or a longer 5 course discovery lunch. We opted for the latter option and asked for an additional course to be added to the menu. The maître d' deftly handled our request ensuring that we were comfortable that the dish and one of our existing dishes contained similar ingredients.An amuse bouche of home made fish cracker with tobiko caviar was a lovely way to start the meal. The fish cracker has a lot of punch to it and the tobiko caviar therefore became more of a textual element, which was both surprising and enjoyable.The first main course of soft shell tempura crab with mango chutney was a lovely light dish. The crab tempura was certainly the star of the dish but the subtlety of the mango chutney and accompanying micro salad added texture and acidity that really allowed for the dish to be a great start to our meal.A second course of coco blanc velouté with a single "soldier" of toasted gruyere cheese and (what we suspected was...) truffles, was beautifully smooth and velvety. The velouté was flecked with black truffles that were cleverly used to add a texture to the velouté. However, the clear star of the dish for me was the beautiful "soldier" which brought back childhood memories of dipping soldiers into soft boiled eggs. Overall a very clever dish.For me the highlight of the meal was the third course of Hokkaido scallop with riso pasta (as the name suggests a pasta that looks almost exactly like grains of rice) with burnt leeks, seaweed and a surf and turf emulsion together with shiso flower heads. This was a wonderful dish in which all the flavours and textures worked together beautifully. The scallop was perfectly cooked and was the star of the dish but it was such a delight to combine it with the different components of the dish to produce different flavour combinations. Particular mention must go to the shiso flower heads whose slightly peppery yet floral bursts of flavour really allowed the fishiness of the scallop to shine through the dish.An additional fourth course of pork jowl with riso pasta, slow cooked egg and parmesan was rich luscious course in which each individual ingredient was its own little star. The dish was almost a play on a risotto but without the almost sauce like nature of the risotto overpowering the dish. The pork (gently powdered with smoked paprika) melted in the mouth and the pasta had a lovely cheesy richness to it.A fifth course of Wagyu beef cheek with carrot and red wine jus was a slight disappointment. Starting with the positive, the beef was cooked to perfection and literally melted in the mouth, which was evidence of great expertise by our chef. However, the dish was a little two dimensional. The beef overpowered the carrots on the plate and the corn purée was sadly lacking in flavour. Something else was required - perhaps a crunchy texture, salty taste or carb based ingredient to really raise the dish.The dessert of melon yoghurt gruyere cheese and olive oil and macademia was perhaps one of the most interesting desserts I have ever enjoyed in a lifetime of eating. It was almost like combining a cheese course and a dessert together and discovering that it actually works...well! Salty and creamy cheese meringue combined with beautiful melon balls and a sorbet with melon (and something else...just don't ask me!) together with crumbs of olive oil cake. A delicious explorations of different textures (hard, soft, smooth, hard) head (cold, warm) and tastes (salty, creamy, sweet, sour). In almost every way unique and in less skilled hands could have been a complete disaster.A particular mention must be made for the excellent wine list. Whilst it is heavily biased in favour of French wines, the wine list does contain some super value wines and some very interesting offerings from boutiquey top-end producers. We ordered a beautiful Buisson Charles Meursault 2009 to accompany our first three courses that had beautiful grassy notes on opening that developed into a lovely clean, vibrant, stone-fruit rich wine with nice power. Our very knowledgeable sommelier deftly guided me into choosing a slightly lighter half bottle of Ducru Beaucaillou 2007 that went beautifully with the pork and was a good match for the beef cheek. Whilst the Ducru was not absolutely outstanding, the choice was very wise and was certainly better than the initial choice I had made (a much stronger, earthier and older St. Julien) and I appreciated our sommelier's patience and deft handling of the situation to ensure that we picked wisely.Overall, this is a very exciting new restaurant and I am looking forward to a return visit to explore the food and wine in more depth! My only criticisms would be (1) the wagyu beef cheek being a slightly two dimensional dish and (2) the wine list being very French leaning - a little more choice of wines from other regions would have been much appreciated. However, both of these are minor quibbles in an otherwise absolutely wonderful meal
4
4-course and 6-course tasting menu for selection.Excellent food with nice service.The house itself was the residence of Garden's in-charge historically.just the location is a bit difficult to find within the garden.car not able to reach their entrance, so you gonna get off at parking and restaurant will send golf cart to come pick you, but we were not told about this beforehand.spent almost 30 mins wandering around between different entrance gates of the park (and the park is huge), quite a headache even we're in car. I hope restaurant can improve by offering directions to guests who reserves tables
5
We had a great experience at Corner House. Staff were attentive, friendly and service was great. They had Happy Birthday doodle on the dessert although we have brought our own cake - very nice gesture. Food was excellent too though they dont have much varieties to choose from.
5
Second dinner visit Lived up to expectations againHad the 4 course meal, which will be more than sufficient for most people If you are particularly hungry there is a six course dinner choice as well My courses were - Oysters Lobster Beef (Japanese) Peaches in Rose Champagne There are additional charges for certain choices Service was friendly, smooth and keen, but alas like most other places in town, many staff were rather uninformed and had problems answering questions on the menu Other than that this is an outstanding restaurant, food that is delicious and beautifully presented, and not pompous
5
Very Nice location in the botanic garden, staff is friendly and keeps friendly even though our team is demanding! Lunch was great all prepared with good flavour and quality. The taste was french colonial.
5
Great experience at corner house.
excellent service.
food is wonderful.
value for money
ever wander if they open another one. a bit cheap. more people will come.

I booked corner house for my mother's birthday dinner through Chope. In the requests box I mentioned a birthday dessert for her that had to be gluten free and egg free as she is allergic. The whole meal was fantastic and they happily catered to her allergies. They proactively gave her gluten free and egg free bread and made sure all the dishes she ordered were safe for her to eat. The staff were extremely knowledgable about all the dishes served and made very good recommendations. In addition, one of the staff even recognized us from many years ago at Iggy's and came over to say hello. The food was fantastic... From the plating to the flavor. We truly enjoyed the entire meal from start to finish. When dessert came, they brought out the dessert for her that was gluten free and egg free. We were extremely happy with the meal and would definitely return
4
The food was really awesome and the staff were attentive ! However I was a bit stunned by the price of water (which we were never informed!!) it cost $15 bucks for water !! I'd love to give full 5 points instead of 4 if only they had informed us about the water :P

Visited the restaurant over the SG50 holiday weekend, went before when it was Les Jardin. Beautiful setting, would be ideal for lunch so visitors could experience more of the gardens. We were presented with two menus, the standard menu and the SG50 special menu. None of us selected the SG50 menu because it was uncomprehensible, it told the Chef's story of growing up in SG and the food that influenced him, but nobody could understand what they would get on their plates. It was too difficult to discern the 'flow' of the menu which is a shame because it could have been a delight. The main menu selections were nicely presented, the Hokkaido Scalop and Carabinero Prawns well plated and tasted very good. For the main the table selected the SG50 special, being the Maple Leaf Farm Duck although we were surprised to hear that the Chef had changed the primary protein from duck and the result was not inspired. The cheese plate was again well plated but uninspired, few of the cheeses had dinstinct flavours and the plate was generally a disappointment.Overall this is a 'go once' restaurant and i would suggest for lunch so you can see the stunning views. For the same pricing my recommendation would be Jaan as I think Chef Tan is trying to create similar dishes but doesn't hit the flavour profile one would expect for the price. Service was patchy, within 5 minutes of seating we were asked at least four times if we were ready to order, but by the middle of the meal it was a challenge to find service, champagne and red wine top-ups required us to flag down service staff. With a bill of ~$1,000 we expected much more professional service delivery.

Great place for a special dinner. The food is outstanding, with creativity of Jason, the chef, impressive. The service is impeccable - attentive but not too overbearing. The environment of the Botanical Gardens provides for an intimate setting, and the layout of the restaurant provides both indoor and outdoor seating options. One tip - the Corner House is affiliated with Wine Culture. We purchased a special bottle of wine there, had it delivered to the restaurant, and the bottle was corked prior to our arrival and able to open up at the perfect time for dinner. Truly a memorable dining experience in Singapore

• Top notch in service and attentiveness.• Service staff were very helpful and approachable with queries and dining promo and such.• Ambience and atmosphere is perfect for couples, or tight-knit group of friends.• Will definitely check out the evening dinner services in the near future.One con so far, I think the staff forgotten the Oignon written note card at the end of our brunch session.Anyhoos, good job to Chef Jason and crew. It was a great sessh at Corner House, and will be back to maybe try the SG50 special

We had brunch here. We loved the charming black and white building and we sat at a corner table so we had an expansive view of the lush greenery outside. I It really was a pleasant experience and a nice escape from the jungle concrete. The combination of the flavorful dishes, courteous servers and perfect ambience - made it a lovely outing. Would definitely come back here for dinner.

The restaurant is located at the botanic garden try and reserve around sunset in order to see the restaurant by day and night. Most of the Taxi drivers will not be able to find it...so make sure they drop you off at the Nassim gate and walk up. (watch your high heels....) our cab driver dropped us of at the supplier side ..making us enter the restaurant through the kitchen...Staff and service is very good and attend which is rare to find in Singapore. Food was nice, a bit expensive but so is the rest of Singapore

For several years I have spent most of my free time having fine dining experiences at San Pellegrino 50 or Michelin starred restaurants. It takes a lot to impress me and this restaurant has consistently impressed my son and I. I feel it is only a brief matter of time until Jason Tan's name is compared to Andre Chiang or Justin Quek and now is the time to experience it. The 62 degree egg with Cevennes onion dish is probably the best dish I have ever had, taking 2kg of onion to make the most sophisticated dish you could imagine. From the sincere cheerful greeting at the front door to the special tin of take home goodies at the end there is nothing more to ask of a fine dining experience
5
Beautiful ambiance and excellent service in Singapore's only UNESCO World Heritage Site. Makes for very special memories.

Kudos to the great menu and creativity of the chefs at Corner House, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here on a quiet weekday evening. Food was lovely, service was alright though it would have been better if the staff were more warm.
5
Less is more and Perfect best describes our experience. Service, food, ambiance and a wet afternoon with a great view of nature, Botanical Gardens!
5
Everything was perfect - food, ambiance, service. Fantastic for any celebration meal or when you want to impress! We had the Discover Menu Experience. We have eaten at Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck, The Roux Brothers' Waterside Inn and Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir Aux Quat'Saisons amongst others and this is the only place that has come close recently. The chef Jason Tan is experimental and brings the best out of fresh seasonal ingredients. Everything is tasty but also engages your other senses. You can tell that Heston is an influence! The service is never going to be fast as this is gastronomy at its best. Relax sit back and let the flavors envelope you! His specialty Onion dish is incredible!!!!! Got to meet the chef at the end and tour the kitchens
5
Tried once last month with a buddy. Was impressed with the quality and taste of the cuisine as well as the dining ambience and service. Came for a second visit to celebrate a birthday dinner with wife. High expectations were met. I find the price reasonable for the high quality dining experience. IMHO the food is on par with Jaan and Les Amis. This is a keeper.

4 of us celebrated a friend's birthday at Corner House. It was our 1st visit to this restaurant despite reading about it for a long time.We 'struggled' with the menu a little but the friendly service was very helpful. He cheerfully lead us through the menu (went through almost every item on the menu).Every dish served was like an art piece presented on the table. Artistically and beautifully presented that you don't bear to eat them (destroying them).Actually this restaurant suits couple dating the best, quiet and tastefully decorated
5
Been here several times! Glad they could kindly accommodate my allergies and modify their recipes.I was in there this evening, and a young named Brandon served my family. He actually suggested things out of my comfort zone, and his suggestions - I was most grateful for
5
My fiancee organised a surprise dinner here for my birthday, and what a treat! Every single part of the experience was just beautifully done. The food, the wine, the service, the beautiful Botanical Garden views (and the cheeky birthday candle in my dessert) made for a truly memorable experience that we would recommend for anyone looking for something truly special. This experience is yet to be surpassed anywhere else, in any other country that we've been to as yet.Go to Corner House, you will not be disappointed

Love the food, quality and presentation. Mum is a small eater, so we ordered 3 course set lunch. But in each segment (appetizer, main and dessert), 2 out of 3 you've to supplement at least 6-12 dollars. We'd Scallop appertizer (add 6), 1 main beef (add 12), 1 main cod (add 8), dessert had ice cream (add 5). End up we paid SGD 240+ for 2 set lunch which was meant to be SGD 42 per set. Yes we had 3 glasses of wine + 1 English tea (add 9). I feel the prices are misleading. Is better to just go for their SGD 88++ set lunch if you like beef. Wine by the glass selection is of good quality. Mum has a Moscat which is great. I'd 1 glass Chardonnay which I think is too expensive (SGD 38 per glass & they really pour to 100ml), another Pouilly Fume which is SGD 23. One thing that taste weird is the dessert ginseng sorbet (which you don't have to add money), though I'm happy to have ginseng chicken soup anytime just not their ginseng sorbet. I will still bring guest over but probably will not order their chardonnay & ginseng sorbet
3
Went there on a date night with the hubby, must say we enjoyed the starters and dessert, but the mains which were beef and chicken were somewhat disappointing. The beef dish had a supplement of $42 and was completely bland.Also asked for wine pairing and was shocked to find the wine pairing being more expensive than the meal itself. Not usually the case and if so, should have been warned before ordering, that was truly shocking. Service was slow but pleasant enough. Definitely not coming back
4
Exquisite French gastronomy. The chef is highly skilled and meticulous in his cooking and presentation. Perfect spot for a romantic, special occasion. However, the service can be improved.
5
Fine dining, colonial style house. Very creative menu & Chef. Service was great. Fantastic for a high-end evening, whether formal or informal. And its right in the middle of the old botanical gardens.
5
Corner house never disappoints. Food was elegant and innovative, staff knowledgeable and attentive but never intrusive. Perfect meal.
5
The historic location in the Botanic garden is hard to beat. We went for lunch that had the set menu which included Soft Shell Crab Tempura and Hokkaido Scallop, which was absolutely delicious. Limited menu selection which is a good idea when you can prepare everything as perfect as we got. The set menu is excellent value, but beware, like other restaurants in Singapore, if you order a good glass of wine and a coffee your lunch costs double up, so stick to the ice-water! Delighted to see how well Chef Jason Tan is doing! Will be back
4
Had the 4 course set meal for brunch. Good fresh food and great service, however, nothing extraordinary.Duck confit pasta well prepared. Appetiser of eggs sunny side up was pretty ordinary.Struggling to find a reason to make the extra effort to come back to this isolated location
5
I thought I had given up on dining scene in Singapore, because I find the fine dining scene here too pricey and not up to mark, having been spoilt by the great kitchens in London and Paris.So it was without much expectations that I went to Corner House and by gosh, I was blown away by the elegance of the cooking. I also love the understated classiness that the chef brought to each course. The chicken breast was the most tender I had ever had, cooked to sheer perfection with juices intact.But unfortunately the chef could not keep up with the crowds that showed up at the $100 gourmet deals promotion by citibank and the standard of cooking dropped. But I would still recommend Corner House highly
4
My wife and I chose this restaurant based upon a recommendation from friends, and it did not disappoint. The food, service and ambience all were top-notch. We enjoyed the 4-course menu (which was enough food) and a bottle of house wine. Everything was well-prepared and the staff was courteous and timely with their help and presence. The only potential drawback is price. But, it's Singapore; par for the course
5
If you want a romantic, fine dining experience this is an excellent choice. The restaurant is in a beautiful location surrounded by the botanic gardens. It is an intimate and peaceful setting which takes you away from the cares of the world. The service wants for nothing. The food is exceptional. It is nouveau cuisine/fine dining . The serves are small, complex and delicately constructed with great attention to detail. Every dish has its own story - the flavours are delightful. The dining options start at $98/ person but you will yourself spending more to try some dishes. So the Corner House is not for everyday but forget the budget for a night and you will have a wonderful experience here. 
5
My friend and I were very impressed not just by the fantastic and exquisite cooking and presentation of this highly rated restaurant but by the fantastic service of the staff. Upon hearing that I was gluten - intolerant, they served me gluten free bread and later offered me gluten free petit fours alongside my tea and coffee after my lunch meal. In addition, the ambiance of the restaurant is very picturesque as it is located in a standalone building in the Botanic Gardens.A buggy will take you up if it rains as it did when. I went, so you will be get wet. One tip for first time customers:enter via Evans Road and not the side of the Botanic Gardens facing Taman Seransi, as that is the wrong end and is too far to walk. This restaurant is ideal for romantic evenings with courting couples or to bring overseas guests
5
Nice ambience, polite staff, delicious meal. How much more could one ask for? Set in the colonial building, in the heart of botanic garden. Every staff is so polite, prompt, and explained the dishes at every serving. Every dish was so intricate, yet so full in texture and taste. What a wonderful night that will stay a long time in our memory.
5
We were very impressed with the service and food, 4 course was enough for us. Don't bother to pay the $42 supplement for the beef main, it's ok but not worth the cost. 62 degree egg was my fav dish.
5
Went there to celebrate my wife's birthday and was so pleased that I brought my foodie relatives back. I had the Discovery menu on both occasions. All the dishes were creatively presented and the flavours were delightful. There wasn't a boring dish. Perhaps, my favourite was the 'onion dish' (sorry, can't remember the name but have a look at the photo) which was a sweet onion cooked in a variety of ways. My wife an I loved the ambience. The service was exceptional. At the end of the meal, chef Jason gave us a tour of the kitchen and sent us on our way with some Madeleines packed in a beautiful tin box. This has become my new favourite restaurant in Singapore
5
I've been blessed to visit about 50 very, very high end fine dining restaurants a year. Little surprises me. My meal tonight at Corner House certainly did in terms of presentation, taste and service in particular the "62 degree farm egg" one of the most exceptional things I've ever had. It is the equal (and indeed superior to one) of several of the San Pellegrino top 50 restaurants. I look forward to my next visit
5
We were invited back after a disaster of a Valentine's night and were so glad that we took up the offer. Wonderful, creative and well balanced meal excellently accompanied by Benedict the sommelier's wine selection and friendly service. We've been lucky enough to dine at very good restaurants in Asia and Europe, and we think Jason Tan should be up there with Atherton and Robuchon given half a chance, plus he's a very nice chap. His food and presentation certainly measured up. Plus if you can secure one of the balcony tables it's well worth it. We'll be back, and I'll never view the humble tomato in the same way again
5
Been there twice in a month. Food is absolutely gorgeous and creative. We had the degustation menu the first time. Second time we had the set dinner menu. It's not crowded. Service is excellent. Staff know the food well and are attentive. Not many tables taken yet. Chef Jason is very talented and in my opinion may have overtaken his sifu. The food is substantial too. I can't imagine how full I am after 4 courses. Definitely must try the sweet onion soup. Chef says it'll be a regular on the menu. I like the cod with crispy skin. Friend tried the sous vide chicken and found it so tender. Nestled in the heart of Botanic Gardens, it's such a treat to walk past the beautiful flowers. If it's raining, ask them to send a buggy to pick you from the Tanglin entrance. Otherwise the best place to park is at the Nassim road entrance. Tell the taxi driver it's the old Botanic Gardens entrance. After the meal, pick a treat home like a petit four such as financiers in a pretty fGift box. So thoughtful because we're usually so full and no space for the petit four
4
The location of Corner House is the star, more than the food. Please note there is a difference to your experience whether you go for lunch or for dinner. At Lunch - a very inexpensive 3 course meal at SGD42 ++. Dinner is much much more $$$. Food at lunch is disappointing though the chef has put in a lot of effort. Let us be realistic. There is no way the restaurant can serve the same quality ingredients at SGD42 compared to dinner which costs 4 times more. However, the view at lunch is so much more enchanting than dinner as you get to see the Garden. The walk to the restaurant is also so lovely when the sun is out and you can see all the beautiful plants.A friend invited us as she had the most amazing dinner there a couple of weeks back. As mentioned earlier, that experience was not replicated at lunch time due to the "budget". However, the food was not bad. Same amount of effort was put into cooking the food and presenting the meal. Service was very attentive and the restaurant, was nearly full.What didn't make the mark was the taste. Everything looked beautiful and amazing but the taste was not there. The soft-shell crab tempura had the hardest batter and the blue swimmers crab was tasteless. The sea bass was alright while the chicken thigh with risotto was excellent. The Wagyu beef (with supplement $) was tough and tasteless. After chewing one slice both dinners gave up. The desserts were amazing. Truly works of art. If only Corner House offered tea and served dessert.I may go back as the setting is magical and no where else in Singapore you can dine in such an interesting house. Give it a try and form your own opinion. And if you want really impressive food, go for dinner

We celebrated my birthday at Corner House. All in all, I have to say it was a truly lovely experience for any special occasion. The good things and these were a lot, to be fair: From the reservation process (When I first tried to book a table, was told it was full and put on waitlist but very promptly informed that there was a cancellation and I got a table after all.), drinks at the little bar they had (lovely bartender and also waiter who showed us to the table thereafter.), to the food (exceptional food; it was extremely fresh and delicious. We really enjoyed Jason Tan's culinary expertise.) as well as the excellent sommelier (who was spot on with his wine recommendations.), it was a truly enjoyable experience. The ambience is perfect for couples and romantic and classy without being overly stiff. The only shortcoming was as mentioned the lack of staff or I think, they just really needed one more staff to be exact. None of the staff were skiving for sure. They were all frantically moving around! But there was one incident of water not being re-filled, wine not being re-filled as well as 2 dishes (we ordered the tasting courses.) not being explained. But we understand there is a huge problem really for all restaurants not being able to get good people these days. I hope it would be something Corner House can change. They tried hard and we appreciated their sweet gestures. It was a birthday and they put a candle on my cheese platter. First time ever I'd seen a candle on a cheese platter and that was commendable! And as we were leaving, one of their wait staff ran after me with a little gift from the chef! Apparently it was a little birthday gift of sweet treats in a lovely Corner House tin. That was pretty much amazing. We would certainly be back because we understand this is a restaurant that tries hard amidst certain limitations and if it continues as it does, we've no doubt it will be a great fine-dining competitor to all the other existing establishments and would be great
1
Ordinary food with poor service staff makes for a poor dining experience. Inconsistent and slow service (eg 40 min wait for dessert)
3
Whilst the atmosphere & food were wonderful we were left with a poor impression and would expect a lot better given the $450 we spent. Let down by the lack of staff. Whilst the sommelier was excellent and food came quickly, as soon as dessert had been cleared we were ignored. The table next to us had the same problem and after 20+ mins waiting we both gave up and ordered the bill. We would have expected someone to come round, check on the experience and discuss coffee/tea/something stronger but instead we were left in the dark. I did mention this and was told that no one wants to work in F&B in Singapore but I would have thought a high end restaurant like Corner House could differentiate and hire staff even if other establishments suffer. A missed opportunity here
5
I knew Chef Jason Tan since 2006 when he was at St Julien and then at Julien Bompard. Now that he is on his own he can express his talent in full and the result is simply outstanding. The best french restaurant in Singapore by far especially for the quality of the cuisine. Refined, creative, surprising, beautiful, tasty.In france this restaurant will be near to as 2 star Michelin award. Service is young and may be improved but nothing negative
5
This is probably one of the best, if not he best restaurant in Singapore, and not surprisingly chosen recently by CNN within the world's top dining places. Chef Jason Tan is creating magic on each dish, well balanced flavors, surprising combinations without being too sophisticated so no risk of leaving with an hungry feeling. Highly priced but definitely worth it. Impressive wine list with a top selection as well as more affordable wines. Great professional staff and a top romantic location is included.
5
If you want fine dining excellent meal this restaurant is worth making the effort to go! Pricey, but worth the quality for Lunch. Only set menus but they can and did give me vegetarian option as I have dietary restrictions. Excellent service. True you have to go into Botanic garden but thats what makes up for the ambience. If you want to walk after the meal you can do it.Dinner is again set menu with more courses but very expensive but still worth it for special occasions! Couldn't try it but based on the Lunch quality I am sure it would be super

We had lunch here as a family of 6, arrived at 12:10pm, but we only managed to eat our main course at 2pm, after having to ask after our food with 4 different service staff. Eventually we spoke to the manager about our meal and he was not too apologetic about it. Our experience was completely ruined as we had to wait so long for our food to arrive while other tables that arrived after us had theirs. The food wasn't amazing either, in particular, the wagyu beef was rather subpar. I would put zero stars if I could.
1
Entered the restaurant at 1210, was the first group of customers to arrive. Finished appetizers at about 1235 to1240. After waiting half an hour for our mains we checked with three different waiters on the progress of our mains and were met with placating remarks with no action.Several tables who arrived after us had already finished their dessert and when we pointed out that fact - the manager told us that it was not the case and we were wrong. Mains were finally served at 1355. Was an exceptionally horrible dining experience - waiting an hour for your mains while putting up with unresponsive and uncooperative service does not help with the mood.On a final note, we stated that we will be sure to reflect this unpleasant experience in a review. We were met with a condescending response from the manager (manager!): "Sure, please do so.
5
Friends recommend here for us.The only disadvantage that I can find is that it's located inside botanic garden and not easy to find. Good atmosphere, friendly waiters. Their appetizers and desserts are more delicious than main dishes. We would still go there if we visit Singapore again. 
5
The biggest gripe everyone has in Singapore is the service. Here you get 5 star service at a 4 star price! Beautiful ambiance, great service and really delicious food. The 3 course set lunch is very generous and won't break the bank either. Ask for a window table. I am looking forward to returning

The EJH Corner House is a historic part of Singapore's Botanic Gardens. It was the former residence of the Assistant Director of the Gardens & now happily a lovely restaurant in a beautiful colonial black & white style bungalow. I had the opportunity to lunch in this idyllic setting recently & came away impressed. Opting for the 5 course degustation, I was able to taste a spectrum of the chef's signature dishes. If you love beets, the starter of this glorious root vegetable paired with smoked eel & a black garlic sauce will blow you away. I had an additional starter of cabinero prawn paired with seasonal tomatoes which was a symphony of flavours. The fish course was New Zealand cod with "crispy scales", accompanied with creamy mash, chorizo & braised Savoy cabbage. I also ate a tempura of soft shell crab with a wasabi sauce, salad greens & tobiko roe. Final savoury course was sous vide free range chicken with foie gras & shavings of black truffle. The restaurant served a pre dessert of fruit jelly, tapioca pearls & a basil sorbet to cleanse the palate before dessert proper was served - black sesame ice cream covered with meringue shards & sesame tuiles. Jason Tan is a talented chef & has a knack for plating beautiful plates of food. Service was attentive but not obtrusive. The only sour note was when the bill was presented. I was charged for a meal I didn't eat & only realized this after I'd left. But the matter was rectified with a phone call. I'd definitely return for more of chef Jason's superlative food
4
I love the ambience here in the Botanic Gardens. Very very beautiful plating and very fresh ingredients. I had awesome cod when I was there and also a very delightful twist on the kaya dessert. Plus salted egg macaroons. Very creative and very beautifully platted. Managed to speak with the chef for a while - he's extremely nice. =

Chef Jason Tan , ex Justin Queck sous chef , is giving us the best of Singapore in CORNER HOUSE .A fantastic diner in a marvelous environment , a tasting menu at the lvel of the best table of Singapore .Products are just perfect and dishes perfecltly executed ! For me a place to go when you love food and clearly at the level of the best

Went for a special birthday dinner and this was amazing. It lived up to expectations and the service was actually very good; gracious, knowledgable and unobtrusive. The staff arranged a golf buggy pickup from the parking lot (turns out we didn't need it, it's closer than the maps show) and also an unobtrusive birthday message with dessert. No loud singing here - phew!It's not cheap, and the servings are small. However in truth the 4 course menu is enough food. We did not leave hungry. Everything is very flavorful, to be savored, and the pure artistry of the dishes means it's a novel experience. This is a special occasion place. The wine list is too long and too expensive. However, there are still several choices below and around $100/bottle which is standard for Singapore - let's face it, cloudy bay is $80 in this town :(. So persevere and don't be intimidated by the long list, just scan quickly for the wines with fewer digits, do a double check with the sommelier, and enjoy!
5
The restaurant is located on a hill in the Singapore Botanic Garden, you can enjoy your meal with the sight seen of forest. The food was very special and the stuff was unique and creative. I love there! Will surely visit again!
5
Everything is a work of art right down to the cutlery. The buggy ride to-fro the restaurant adds to the experience!
5
I've been fortunate enough to eat in many top restaurants. food and service wise the Corner House is right up there near the top in the world (but not exceptional enough to be the very best - not really a criticism!). the setting is exceptional. So overall it is a simply fantastic place to eat; which, given the prices, should be expected. Key point is that if you want a very good expensive meal in a great setting, this will not disappoint. Get a window seat if possible. If you want to propose to somebody, I can't think of many better places
4
Imaginative menu by Chef Jason Tan, which was a unique blend of French inspiration of Asian dishes. That, coupled with attentive service, made this an evening to remember. The restaurant opened only 3 months ago, hence it did not seem well patronised as yet. A monsoon storm burst as we ended the meal, but we were chauffeured to our car in a golf buggy well-protected from the elements
4
Had the desgutation menu for dinner.The amuse boche and fish were so so.The onion tea, pasta with lobster and steak were excellent.Service was not that good. Had to beg for the wine list, and the aperatif only came after the first course.Lunch was less to shout about. The food was fin
4
The vegetable dishes were all wonderfully done with interesting twist to the taste and great presentation, making vegan food more palatable. A few veg dishes to recommend are the Oignon dour des cevennes (baked onion) and a tomato starter of tomatoes in different styles like mousse, dried pickled, sweetened and raw. The onion was slow baked till it caramelised yet still firm enough to hold a soft boiled egg. The sweetness and the umami of onions just goes so well with the egg and the accompanying onion crisps just adds a different dimension to the whole dish.Meat was also al dente, retaining the sweetness, juiciness and tender texture. Carabinero prawn, New Zealand cod 'crispy scales' and free range chicken are some of their really good dishes. The cod fish was tender with the scales pulled back and fried to have a really crispy skin.Good ambience and service as well. Would definitely be back when they have a new menu
3
Beautiful setting but the restaurant loses its purpose by not understanding the psychology of the clients. One pays good money to enjoy a dining experience, not just a meal. So slow service and allowing noisy women to chat loudly next to couples' tables don't help. One can only hope that the owner will be enlightened.

Refurbished to reflect its former self of a "black & white" bungalow home in colonial Singapore in the Botanic Gardens. The new operators have revived the memories of EJH Corner and there are lovingly restored photos and cosy corners dedicated to him.We were seated upstairs - out on the balcony in a corner enclosed with glass and air-conditioned which was much appreciated at high noon! Service was excellent and attentive.We opted for the business set lunch - 3 courses for S$38++.The tomato variation starter was full of oohs & aahs as each mouthful presented a different flavour. For those who picked the marinated Norwegian salmon trout - it was a generous serving topped with tobiko.We all selected the riso pasta with seafood which was quite different and the pasta was almost rice shaped & absorbed the flavours of the seafood most subtlely. Our vegetarian friend was offered the same riso pasta without the seafood but substituted with vegetables and she was surprised with asparagus spears!Both desserts - the soursop sorbet & the kaya toast interpretation with a delightful finish for a light business set meal.Based upon our first basic experience, I believe the Discovery Menu Experience also offered at lunch would be quite a gastronomic delight. Next time..........

The food looks MUCH better than it tastes. Except for (what seems to be the head) waitress, service is a bit clueless for a restaurant of this caliber. If commercially-shrewd Les Amis group find it hard to make a profit with Les Jardins (whose food was, overall, better than Corner House) at this splendid location, it's hard to see how this new restaurant could. Lunch (both menus) is excellent value. The wine list is short on non-French names
4
This is stunning location, pretty, leafy green as you walk inside. The place smells lovely, the staff are friendly, I felt like I was in a country home from Australia. Then the menu came, and there was no ala carte, only two set. I guess I'm a control freak, but I don't like being told what I have to eat. The food was stunning, I have to say, pretty, and lovely looking on the plate, but just too small. The chicken and sweetcorn main was delicious, but I wanted to order a second portion because I was still hungry. And to have to take to bread, is not ideal for us ladies! The service was excellent, bravo. I would go back, but I'll have a snack before hand
