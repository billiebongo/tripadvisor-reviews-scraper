Thinking of a lunch place with a bunch of girlfriends? That was how I chanced upon Toots Brasserie with a cozy ambience and a 3-course French cuisine menu that won't break your bank account. Desserts are not included but do try the chocolate profiteroles. Yum!

We order 2 salad.. 4 start, a back cod 3star ( because over cook the fish and got some bone ) , duck confit 4 star, and last with a clear soup.. 2 star.. too much spicy for me....

It's not really in city centre and usually people might think it's just so so especially in doubt of its authenticity as a French restaurant in an Arab hotel.I ordered its favourite pan-seared frog legs, foie gras terrine and deep fried crispy pork belly. Particularly the crispy pork belly is great. Very crispy skin and juicy meat, though the bottom of the meat is a little bit dry. However when matched with its mashed potato it gives a nice balance of complicated taste.The frog legs are good but if it could exclude the backbone of the frog it would be better because it's difficult to eat with fork and knife. Foie gras terrine is above standard and matched very nicely with red wine (I ordered Haut Brion) and the slightly sweet brioche.The ambience is appropriate particularly for small group dinner. Service is very attentive and nice.Place to come again

Ok so its a French restaurant and what's more with a pretty highly touted chef, I was like wow must be good coupled with all the fantastic reviews.The restaurant was nothing fancy and tables were small and squeezy. Nothing romantic and lighting was dim. They could have added on a tablecloth or tea light candles to enhance the atmosphere. I know this isn't a high end restaurant but still some thoughts could have gone into it. Staff were attentive though and pretty quick, but just lacking in some form of follow up due to shyness or fear of opening a can of worms (will describe more)Ordered the escargot and frog leg. Snails were small in size, one of the smallest I ever had and one of them had bits of sand or watever grainy in them; and the frog leg while not too bad, still weren't exactly wow. Ordered the pork belly as was recommended to be one of the signatures. It was served cold and didn't whet my appetite. Also had the beef cheek, served in claypot, another signature. Maybe just not my style... tasted like bak kut teh to me..I was asked how was dinner by the server, and my reply was bit hesitant and went

We revisited Toots Brasserie for dinner as we enjoyed the food 2 months ago.Once again I opted for the pan-seared fois gras which was just as good. For our mains, I had the beef tenderloin while my husband chose the pork belly which we both liked very much. While we were deciding on the wine, we had a chat with the friendly female staff. We were surprised to learn from her that chef Jason had recently left the restaurant and the sous chef has taken over. For a moment we were worried that the food would not be up to par. Fortunately our fears were unfounded as the new head chef proved to be just as competent.After a satisfying meal, we had a quick chat with the chef. We hope to return in the not too distant future.Including a bottle of lovely red wine, we paid S$235 for 2 starters, mains, dessert, espresso, taxes and tips

Handling reservation, demeanor of floor staff, table setting; all are fine.But, unacceptable to serve a hot main dish when still working on a cold starter. Also unacceptable to bring a bill before asking if I try dessert or/and coffee after a main dish.Foie gras terrine was good, but a bit salty for me. Beef cheek was tender but not juicy. Assorted vegetables were not well prepared, and the sauce was obscure for me.With respect to wine, poured volume is quite variable among servers, and I expected full bodied flavour of Temranillo

Restaurant is in a small colonial like hotel, pretty and cozy. Best is they serve reasonable priced set lunches even on a weekend! Ordered a side, Truffle fries, nice. Starters was salmon and pumpkin soup. Love the pumpkin soup, hot but a bit to sweeter side. Mains had duck confit and fish. Duck was crispy but bit salty. Fish was my preferred choice but portion is small. End off w normal coffee or tea else top up $3 for better options. Too bad, they don't hv decaff coffee options.We ordered 4 types of dessert but wld recommend the creme bruele and molten choc lava only. They even help write bday greetings, nice!Worth a go for the price, ambience and friendly staff

This is a rebranding of an old favourite restaurant of mine located in the Sultan Hotel on Jalan Sultan Road. The ambiance is as good as it ever was, but the menu is a little less sophisticated. The wine list is reasonable, and service pretty good. I particularly miss the chateaubriand steak for two. As a result I have downgraded it in my personal list as convenient and pretty good from a definitely make time to go to while in Singapore

Went to Toots Brasserie for my birthday dinner. Made my reservation prior, was warmly greeted by the staffs at the entrance and was seated immediately. Ordered the Beef Cheek Bourguinon and the hearty farm vegetable soup as my appetizer. My friend ordered the pan roasted beef tenderloin. We were both very satisfied with the quality of food. The ambiance was great as well. The staffs were very attentive to our needs. Service was top notch. We ordered the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream for our dessert which was a great finale to our dinner. Overall, a highly recommended place for anyone looking for authentic french cuisine. Pricing is reasonable. A great setting for special occasion like anniversary or birthdays

Dinner at Toots Brasserie was a birthday dinner and extended family catchup. Since our host, the family matriarch, took care of the bill (thank you so much!), I wasn't sure if Toots put together a special 3 course deal for our party of 19.The choices for entree were pan seared scallops, home-made sausage or vegetable soup. Again, a choice of 3 mains: pan seared sea bass, beef cheeks and duck leg confit. Two desserts to choose from: lemon tart or royal chocolate. I chose the scallops, sea bass and royal chocolate.General thoughts on the entree (from me and the family) - the portion size of the sausage and vegetable soup were fine, but they could have been more generous with the scallops. No complaints about the taste from everyone, although I felt my scallops could have been served warmer.General thoughts on the mains - Again, everyone loved their mains, but most commented on the different portion sizes between the options. The duck confit was filling, and those who chose the sea bass said that they would have liked a larger portion. The skin on my bass was crisp, but over seared to my liking.Dessert - everyone enjoyed theirs. Toots do their desserts very well.The ambience was good, lighting perfect, furnishing clean and comfortable, and I was just sorry for the other patrons that the family was a little excited seeing each other. The staff were attentive and gave reasonable service, although I must suggest that a restaurant of this calibre ought to issue uniforms. Another suggestion: the door between the dining room and kitchen should have been closed at all times. All in all a great experience, everyone enjoyed themselves, and I would have given 5 stars had portion sizes been consistent and slightly larger. Thank you Toots

There are many French restaurants in Singapore offering all kinds of fusion French. But if you want traditional French with no fusion then this is the place!

Chef Jason has mastered the art to prepare authentic French hearthy meals and the seamless service truly make you feel at home (I mean France of course)... You should definitely check this out!

We were in the mood for some French food. A quick search on the internet and the name Toots Brasserie caught my eye. This is a restaurant located in a boutique hotel converted from a row of shophouse near Kampong Glam. We decided to book a table for dinner on a week night.When we arrived, we were the only patrons in the restaurant so we had a choice of where to sit. I enjoyed the pan-seared foie gras which was tender with no visible sinews although I would have liked a bigger portion. For our main course, I chose crispy duck leg confit while my husband opted for oven-roasted rack of lamb. To round off the meal we had profiteroles au chocolat and expresso. The wait staff appeared to be inexperienced. For example when we ordered the house red, it was served cold as they had not taken out the wine from the fridge early enough to allow it to warm up. Mind you this is not unusual in Singapore.Our bill in total came up to under $150 including the usual 10% service charge and 7% GST. This is very affordable for the quality of food served.I like the food at Toots Brasserie, which was well presented and delicious including the complimentary home-made bread. However I felt there was no atmosphere that night as only three tables were occupied. Perhaps the location is not so great unlike those restaurants in Club Street area which enjoy more patronage. I would, however, still make a return visit perhaps on a Friday or Saturday night instead of other nights in the week

I went to Toots Brasserie for lunch and was seated immediately.There were a number of interesting choices in the set lunch menu and after asking my server for recommendations, I ordered the Duck Rillette and the Crispy Pork Belly.The Duck Rillette was tasty although I found the bread slightly hard. The Pork Belly was very good. The meat was delicious and the skin was crunchy.Service was good. My server was attentive, unobtrusive and gave me a quick description of the various dishes.This is a great place for French food at reasonable prices. My set-lunch cost $16.50 including taxes, which was inexpensive considering the quality. According to my server, the brasserie changes the set lunch menu every two months.I'll be back in March

A true hidden gem!! Amazing French fare in affordable prices! A total must-go! Had a birthday catch-up with friends here and had an absolutely delightful experience which impressed me. The restaurant had very attentive and polite staff who kept making sure our water is always filled and changed plates where necessary. Starters were ok but the stars of the evening were the mains. We had duck confit and beef tenderloin with foie gras (add-on). OMG! If you haven't had any duck confit that has ever impressed you, you better come here! Skin was crisp, meat was tender. The duck was paired with slightly toasted potato gratin and accompanied by some broccoli with red wine sauce. I wished they had a tad more sauce and that dish would have pushed the rating to 5 stars. Beef tenderloin according to my friends were delish too. For desserts, we had the citron tart and profiteroles. In all honesty, the profiteroles are pretty forgettable. The citron tart on the other hand was very yummy, and again one of the better ones I've tasted. Not too sour lemon citron curd paired with berries and meringue all cupped in a crisp biscuit pan base. But that's not all there were little bits of candied citron slice surprises that elevated the dessert experience. Definitely a nice ending to a great meal! Just want to share that parking can be quite difficult to find. There are parking by the road, which is free after 5pm. Otherwise u can park at the textile centre across the road. I'll definitely be back for more goodies

Chanced upon this French diner when I saw it on an on-going promotion with Deal.com.sg and decided to give it a try. My family and I were there to celebrate my Mum's Birthday and the entire experience was superb. Service was attentive and patient, quality food and cosy ambience. Will definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and this is the start to me being a regular here. Chef (Partner) Jason came by after we finished our dinner to have a little chat with us and to thank us for dining at his restaurant. Thumbs up to the great first impression and impeccable service we received during our dinner

My husband and I stumbled onto this restaurant last night while searching for a place to eat at Kampong Glam. A lovely French brasserie at The Sultan, the boutique hotel. The staff, from Kelvin the manager to Francis who served us, to Jason the chef, were friendly, warm and sincere!We ordered the Le Cassoulet, skipping the starters as we wanted to have space for dessert. I love duck confit and order it whenever it's on the menu in any restaurant I go to. The duck confit here is very good - tender and sweet inside with a crispy and tasty skin. The portions were just right for us, and the sides (mesclun salad and grilled vegetables) complemented the meal. The prosecco we ordered was a little warm at first, but after we'd brought that to the attention of the staff who added ice to the bucket, it was just right! We decided to order cakes from the counter for dessert - a great decision as the cakes were light and delicious!We intend to return to try the other dishes!The only wrinkle on that visit was the woman at the next table who talked loudly on her mobile. She only moved away because her companion told her to go outside to finish her call

For a boutique hotel setting with a nice dinning room, we really think this is a good value for money restaurant with quality food. We went on a Sunday with a reservation and it looked very quiet to start with but filled up quickly after 1 pm. In fact, services were a bit slow and less than perfect at later part of dinning hence there is no perfect score. But the quality of food and cooking is still much better than some hotel restaurants I have visited in Europe. Wine was a bit pricey but the house wine quality was good. The bread served was very good and we had to request the waiter to fill the basket again before the main courses arrive. The lamb cutlets I have was done to perfection and the Confit Canard (duck) were very good too. We chose desert from the display counter instead of the menu and they were excellent, taste as good as they look. So we will certainly return again

I would like to share my experience with Toots Brasserie. My fiancee and me spotted the restaurant 2 weeks ago when we casually have our Sunday walk around hotel sultan. Despite we already have lunch, my fiancee decided to walk in after seeing the menu outside the hotel. The manager, Jason, is very friendly, approaching us, and explain the menu,and offer us to make reservation anytime. Good first impression. He explain that people normally hesitate to go in, since it's a french restaurant, inside a hotel some more, but we're surprised that it's very affordable.We decide to come back a week after, (my fiancee made reservation,) and both of us ordered Duck leg confit. While waiting , we were served bread and butter, and Jason introduced himself to us, and explain the menu. He even serve a small sample of duck rillet, which is very nice of him , for us while waiting the food.The food is awesome, i totally enjoy the experience. What i like the most is the ambience and the mood. The music keeps playing Bossanova tunes and the dimmed lighting create a suitable mood. After the main course we decide to order Profiteroles au Chocolat : Homemade baked choux pastry with vanilla ice cream, roasted almond flakes and chocolate sauce.I would like to give the food , value for money, and service two thumbs up, definitely, worth it to recommend

We chose this place on the back of the chef's reputation as we loved the food at his previous restaurant, and were pleased to find that he was here at this newly opened restaurant not far from our hotel (Pan Pacific Beach Road). When we called to reserve, we asked for a baby chair too. When we arrived, the waiter seated us and immediately told us that the chef could prepare something for our 2yo, if we would like it. That was so welcome, as we were a bit worried about whether our 2yo would eat much of the food we ordered. And so we asked for pasta with tomato sauce. We tried it ourselves and it was actually freshly made and very delicious! Our own food was superb – foie gras melted in the mouth, duck was very tender, fish was delicate and fresh. Perhaps as there weren't many patrons yet, the waiter, chefs and proprietors came out to talk to us and were very friendly and helpful. The waiter again offered for the chef to prepare small desserts for our little one, but we declined as he would not eat much. Imagine our surprise when they brought out 3 little desserts; one for each of us and the little one’s was simple but specially prepared one. We were so touched with their thoughtfulness. Together with the high quality of food here, this is definitely one restaurant we recommend! When we got the bill, we were pleasantly surprised that they did not even charge us for the little one’s pasta, which we were prepared to pay for
