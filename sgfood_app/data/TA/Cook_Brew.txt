Went to Cook and Brew @Westin (Asia Square tower ) with my partner yesterday. It was my first visit to this relatively new Hotel. The positive experience started with the polite Valet service and extended to the restaurant.Being a vegetarian, I can be a difficult customer to please because of my food requirements and the little adjustments that the chef might have to make to accommodate my dietary requirements.At cook and Brew the servers were prompt and guided us on the food items that they could make vegetarian for us . The food was decent though the tomato soup seemed made from canned puree. Had caramel butter tart for dessert which was divine .Overall a good experience

I went down to Cook & Brew recently for a friend's birthday.First of all, the deco and the view of level 33 Westin is just stunning. Plus there were live music (even on a Wednesday).We ordered a grilled bread, pad thai fries and rib-eye steak to share plus a desert. The grilled bread is certainly a must try and is simply a taste of heaven in the mouth. The pad thai fries is interesting and the rib-eye steak is above average. Overall a very pleasant experience for the taste buds.The only slightly negative thing to say about Cook & Brew is its service. They are very smiley but quite inexperience. It was also not easy to get their attention probably because we were sitting at the far end

Great and interesting food like Pad Thai fries, truffle fried chicken, beef pot roast, roasted broccoli. Nice atmosphere to
5
This is a place you wouldn’t want to miss if you’re up for drinks. Thank you Ariff and Nathan for your warm service.

The whipped buffalo milk & ricotta cheese with truffle honey and grilled bread was outstanding as an entree. As a main, the Miso cod was a good portion and very well cooked however came with an ant's portion of Chinese broccolli.We had the shaved Brussels Sprouts, roasted broccoli and perogies to share. There just seemed to me to be alot of cheese on these shared dishes, albeit different types of cheese
5
Really cool vibe, high floor of the The Westin Singapore. Snack menu and main menu. Would be perfect for a cool function.

Colleagues organised my birthday lunch here and I must say, it was fantastic. Not only did the food taste good, but the staff was super friendly, especially Mary Grace. They surprised me with a cake and Mary Grace made the effort to walk the long way to surprise me from the back
4
Nice place to hang out for drinks. The bar is situated at a central location within the Westin Hotel, but in the CBD area, so it tends to be filled with professionals/expats. View used to be unblocked and much nicer, but still drinks are affordable and ambience is nic
5
Really thank you for giving a wonderful hospitality to my wife for her birthday celebration! Thank you for the complimentary champagne & flower arrangements!The food, drinks & ambience are great! Most importantly, the entire crew was attentive of our needs from time to time! Thank you Cook & Brew! Hope to see all of you again!

I am writing to let the management know how much I appreciate the outstanding customer service that your staff provided last week. My Friend was arranged a farewell party at cook and brew and is was my first time visit . The staff was very attentive and helpful. The employee I interacted with especially Wendy,were very knowledgable about food and beverage drink. First at all she introduces the promotion drink and pairing with the bar snack. We ordered most of the bar snacks from the menu was really delicious. Especially the turkey meat ball and the truffle chicken. That night the bar was extremely busy and crowded yet she was very patience to guide her colleague which I believe she is newly joined

I really like cook and brew for its classy ambience yet rather affordable prices. Drinks are nice to

We had a work lunch in the run up to Christmas and this is conveniently close. The food was excellent and the view certainly memorable, but it was often a challenge to get the attention and engagement of the team. We had a large table and probably ordered over 1/3 of the menu, I think the burrata gets the call out as the best dish, as well as the Lobster and Avocado toast. The description from the website below is obviously trying to be all things to everyone which may explain why they don't come off that well as a bar - unless you have the patience of a saint - and definitely miss the mark for fine dining. The gastro-bar is more than just a venue for the working crowd, setting the stage for all who seek a balanced lifestyle. One of the most distinctive hotel bars in Singapore, Cook & Brew serves modern interpretations of classical bar favourites and local comfort food, with a meticulously-curated list of fine wines and an extensive selection of beers
3
We joined in a party of 8 on a Thursday night. We booked at the last minute but they had plenty of space for a 7:30pm sitting. It was fairly empty. We turned up and ordered drinks. Before drinks came they took the food order and starters arrived before any drinks. Shockingly slow drink service which continued throughout the dinner.The food was really nice tasty gastro pub fare and if it wasn't for the drink service I would probably rate at four or five stars. I won't bother going out fo my way to go again
5
Had drinks with a friend after work by the bar. Was served by both Ariff and Nathan, they were excellent. We had a great time that night. Not to forget, the view was wonderful as well.Will definitely come back for more drinks agai
5
Came here for a long time catchup meal, they have a $10 nett happy hour promo that last the night, 3 mains to share was pretty filling, view and ambiance was very good as well
4
My family went for NYE dinner as the online mentioned it is one of the best places to watch fireworks but much to my children disappointment it was not entirely seen. And we dont have proper table to enjoy our dinner. But I would like to draw attention to Mary who was very helpful in assisting my daughter who is a vegetarian/vegan. The whole dinner experience was good but for NYE it was just ok
5
Overlooking the entire Marina Bay Area, this restaurant offers a quieter place for meals within the hustle and bustle of the CBD. Dishes offer reasonable portions/servings and are tasty tooVery prompt service - some very beautiful waitresses too!A bit pricey but still reasonable considering the location and settingNot too crowded or noisy, hard to find within the CBD
4
Restaurant with alot of buzz, value for money on Friday. Live band and cocktails and house pours at special price
4
Step into Cook and Brew on a Friday evening, and you would catch the TGIF vibe almost instantaneously. With a live vocalist and guitarist performing in the background, together with groups of working executives chattering loudly, it is hard not to feel the subtle partying vibe in the air here.We made a table reservation about five days in advance, and we got a table by the window for our dinner. You should make a reservation in advance too, as the restaurant is very crowded when we visited.We had the Pad Thai Fries for starters, followed by Maple Miso Cod and Hawker Burger for mains. The restaurant team was quick to serve the starter but took very long to serve the main dishes. We decided that it might be due to the crowd. The food tastes quite good, and we were happy with it. However, as mentioned in one of the earlier reviews by a fellow TripAdvisor contributor, the Pad Thai Fries does come soggy, so just keep that in mind. Overall, I felt that the experience was good, and the place deserves a visit if you happen to be around the area
4
Cook & Brew is a perfect place for you to chill and hang out with live band. The ambiance and service was good as well
5
Had a wonderful dinner experience at the restaurant.From the beginning to end was well attended by floor staff as well the manager on duty. Food was Great!!My cousin love the ambience, food & service!!Definitely will return to this restaurant.
4
An average nice resturant for a quick business lunch. The ambience and and food is what you would expect under a Westin-managed brand but I think it could be better. The food and service is average. At such a high level (33 floor), unfortunately it has a blocked view. You get a full view of an large office block in front. Sadly, it’s not a destination dining place or for a special occasion. It’s at best a casual diner.
4
I've actually eaten there twice in the last week for client meetings. I like the decor, good menu and staff are very helpful; but service is slooooooooooooow! It took more than 5mins to flag a waiter (which is a long time when your trying to kick start a business lunch)... the food then took more than 40mins to arrive, which is too long for an executive CBD lunch. The food was excellent and no other complaints. Had the steak and it was exceptional

It has to be either too good or extremely bad for me to want to leave a comment about a restaurant. Here’s how it started. I’ve made my reservation about 1 month ago, when I reached the restaurant they told me they can’t find my reservation. I confirmed I’ve made the reservation and told them was under my name. The staff has to ask me 3 times if I did booked under another name for 8pax. I said repeatedly of course it is cause I booked it and even showed them my phone with the reservation indicated. So they were like lost and cause only me and 1 friend arrived first they walk us to a table for 2. Both my and I were puzzled, so we told them didn’t we say 8 pax (but I did tell them we happen to have 6 confirm pax for the night). Anyway, after some commotion they eventually set up the tables for us. Next we have a cake with us, we asked to have it fridge for us and bring out later. The staff told us they don’t have chiller (hmm this is really strange, first time I heard of especially for a restaurant in a hotel). Anyway, we didn’t have a choice but say it’s fine we just have to except that we will be having a somewhat melted cream cake. The next thing the staff did is to pull a chair and wanted to place the cake there. We were kinda shock. Really? We told them no we would like it to be place away and bring in the cake after we finish the mains. When it’s time to bring out the cake, another staff came and ask are we aware that there’s a cake handling charge of $15++, we said no and I asked why since we brought in the cake throughout the dining period nobody mention. I asked so it’s your fault or my fault. So she asked if we still like to consume our cake, like we have other choice we just have to said yes because it seems like they will not be waived it at all. Question here is what kind of handling did they do when they didn’t even have a fridge to keep it. So if we have just left the cake on the chair and help ourselves to the cake that did not even go through them at all, I will still be made to pay the $15++ handling fee without us knowing theirs this clause? Food wise, disappointing besides the shoe string fries nothing impressed us at all. Food even bar/snack food choice was limited. For a Friday, the restaurant was pretty empty. For the price and all, honestly you can find other better choice in the area. The staff were not very attentive and they all looked grumpy but apparently when they serve overseas guests they seems more helpful and friendly. For a restaurant in a hotel, I think there is expectations and anyone that patronize deserve better service. I believe this is the first and my last visit to them. So those still like to try, I hope you get a better experience. Do not have expectation for food though

The food tasted ok; the Guiness was on tap. I am not sure how they set their menu but it was a very eclectic collection of food. Do not order the Pad Thai Fries. They were terrible, soggy
5
Held a corporate drinks event there for 40-50 pax last week. Service was amazing and value for money. Best of all was the cosy venue on the 33rd floor of the Westin which had sweeping views of the city skyline and ocean. Would highly recommend Mary, Thomas and their team for corporate events or just a casual drink!

Team lunch at Cook & Brew. Here again, dining at level 33 with a lovely sea view. I’m a vegetarian, what can I order? There aren’t much vegetarian options available, so I ordered the Handmade Ricotta Cavatelli (S$28++) again and Shoe String Fries (S$6++). The presentation of this dish - Ricotta Cavatelli was so much better than what I had in April. Taste wise – delectable! Love the Shoe String Fries a lot, I can’t stop eating it. My wonderful bosses ordered some vegetarian friendly starter dishes for all to share – Roasted Broccoli (S$14++) and Burrata (S$21++). Interesting presentation. Such a fun and delicious team lunch. It would be much more fantastic if Cook & Brew could has more vegetable forward cuisine dishes on their menu which mean more vegetarian choices
4
Cook & Brew is an excellent place for business lunch. Love the food and ambiance there and will head back there again
4
Cook & Brew continues to be one of my favourite places to discuss matters with business associates or just to chill.Whilst the lunches are fine, the dinner menu didn’t appeal to me - mainly because I am not a fan of fusion cuisine.The thing that wins me over time and again is the excellent service
3
The service was extremely long, they also brought the wrong cocktail and we had to ask three times to get butter. We were expecting more a restaurant in a place like the Westin!!!
5
Nice location and you've got a view overlooking the marina bay area. Service wise it's prompt and great. We had the pork chop, lobster sandwich, half chicken ( they called it half bird ), the cod fish, and a couple of starters which includes the kimchi beef and fries.All of it were extremely tasty and of great portion. We totally enjoyed the food there. The desserts are also very good and of high quality. We will definitely come back again
4
Stunning night view with great dining ambiene. The restaurant is huge which come with a lounge at the front entrance. The good was delicious too
3
Nice location overlooking Marina Bay/the CBD. However, service and food (had the set lunch) could use some improvement. The starter (prawn and avocado toast) and main (yellowfin tuna salad) were good but the dessert (ice cream) was disappointing. Staff were generally friendly but service was rather slow throughout the various courses
4
Good steak and an interesting take on a toffee pudding for dessert. Nice atmosphere, with informal dining, a bar, wine area and more formal tables
5
Cook & Brew is located on the 33rd floor of The Westin. If you choose to sit outdoors, be prepared to be awestruck by the breathtaking view. Likewise, the interior is spacious and the ambience is great.It was my first time trying Ricotta and it will definitely not be my last. I relished every bite of the bread dipped in smooth and creamy ricotta.Also, the servers were attentive and patient, I had a pleasant time there. Thank you all
5
Having dinner with my gf, love the view facing Singapore flyers. The staff were attentive,friendly and really helpful towards our request. They have huge selection of beer and wines, so donâ€™t worry the beverages list will keep u occupied
4
Located at Westin Hotel, the restaurant is spacious with decent view (33rd floor).Their set lunch which is 40++ was indeed value for money as the amount of food they serve was really big!I propose the restaurant to lower the price and lessen the food quantity as the portion was too big for even a male adult to finish.You can get 10% discount if you are SPG Member
4
Beautiful ambience fantastic waitstaff and delicious food. Had the roasted broccoli and whipped ricotta both were exquisite and delicious. The beef shortribs were fall off the bone tender and tasty. Special mention to Mandy Lim our excellent and patient waitress. Loved the experience
3
The best thing about this restaurant is the view - overlooking the port of Singapore. On a clear day it is stunning. The food however does not match the view - it tries hard but somehow seems a bit out of place with the character of the venue. The venue also seems to suffer from an identity issue - is it a bar or is it a restaurant? It is somewhere in between.
5
Fantastic place with amazing services, great ambience. A special mention to Mandy Lim - professional, with a great attitude and extremely friendly, this place is blessed to have her! Highly recommended bar in Singapor
5
The food is fantastic especially the Rib Eye Steak. All the staff are very friendly and helpful. Great view of the Marina Ba
5
The place was beautiful and has a great view. Tables were nicely spaced out, providing lots of privacy. Great for couples and even corporate events. Enjoyed myself thoroughly thanks to the great service from Chandralekha and Mandy. I didn't get to try the dessert, sadly. But I will be back again for sure

My husband and I first visited Cook and Brew two years ago, and have gone back on three more occasions since then, for the most part because of the amazing food! Chef Aaron Foster, a fellow Canadian, has developed a fantastic menu that highlights the best of both Canada and Asia, and which he frequently changes and updates, so there is always something new and delicious to try each time we visit. Standout favourites that seem to stay on the menu include the meatballs that are made fresh in-house, the whipped ricotta with truffle honey and grilled bread, the potato and cheddar perogies (a rare dish to find in Singapore and a delicious comforting dish) and the pulled pork poutine, a Canadian classic with a twist! The food is creative and flavourful, presented beautifully and impeccably prepared, we've never had a dish we didn't thoroughly enjoy. We were back again just last night and along with a couple of our usual favourites from the list above, I tried the 'pot roast', which consisted of beef short ribs that were so tender I didn't even bother to use my knife, and a delicious, light as air polenta flavoured with goat cheese and mascarpone. It was a perfect dish in my opinion, the flavours worked together beautifully, and it couldn't have been any better prepared, seasoned or flavoured. The highlight for me of any meal is always dessert, and the desserts here are equally as impressive as the main courses. These too change frequently, and there are usually five or six tempting options to choose from. The caramel butter tart I had last night was a reminder of home, a truly Canadian dish that I've never seen outside of the country, but elevated beyond a simple tart with the addition of a delicious tonka bean chantilly cream and a refreshing blood orange sherbet. We were also lucky enough to get to try a new dessert that's going to be part of the new menu debuting in the next month or so, an amazing peanut butter ice cream concoction with chocolate biscuit layers, peanuts, roasted marshmallows and a sinfully delicious toffee sauce that altogether reminded me taste-wise of a Snickers candy bar, but a way more fancy and interesting version, and one of the best desserts I've had in recent memory!Aside from the food, the atmosphere is great, with nice views out of the massive windows that line two sides of the restaurant; from our table we could see Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer all lit up at night. The service is always professional, as well as kind and attentive, our water glasses were never empty and we were checked on often to ensure we were enjoying the food and our experience by a number of the very friendly staff. Overall, this is a great place to dine solo, as a couple, or with a group of friends (all three of which I've done). In a city with an overwhelming number of restaurants we try to pick new ones often and only rarely find any that we return to more than once or twice, but Cook and Brew is one of our favourite and we'll be visiting again
4
Nice view, and bucket/wings combo was quite worth it at 40 bucks. But the poutine was starngely sweet and a bit weird.
4
We had a great team and colleagues moment at Cook and Brew. Nicely hosted with great attention to any ask from the guests. Easy and flexible. Strongly recommended
5
We recently held a casual networking event at Cook and Brew. The service was impeccable. The ambiance was really nice, it was quiet for a Tuesday evening. The bar offers up a great view. Mary Grace (Supervisor at Cook & Brew) was of great help and she was there throughout the night to offer her assistance. We had some bar finger food, my favorite was the hosin-lime chicken wings. This was our 2nd time holding our networking event there, and I will definitely consider having our next event there
5
I was here for a business lunch and was very happy with the location, relative quietness, set up, service and price.The restaurant is housed within Westin hotel right in the middle of the business district (Downtown MRT station is 5 mins walk away). It's on 33rd floor and hence has a good view of the surrounding areas - making the setting relaxed and there's enough privacy to have good conversations.'The severs were attentive and unobtrusive.Food was well prepared but I found the pork belly that came with the stir fried vermicelli dry.Overall this place still gets an Excellent rating from me
4
Friendly service,various choices of beer selection from over the world. Relaxing ambience, perfect for couples to dine in. Food,must try for appetiser Whipped buffalo milk ricotta. Main course, go for Slow roasted Canadian pork chop. Definitely blow ur taste bud away from the 1st bite. Dessert, Molten sticky toffee pudding. Special thanks to the service provide by Tri and Nabil, unforgettable meal experience. Definitely will come back to dine again.
4
Great food - the surf and turf dish to share was amazing. Lobster very well cooked and the steak was one of the better ones i have had in SG. Service was polite and friendly if not sometimes a little slow. All in all - a great night out
4
Staff were all attentive and polite making sure my friend and I were comfortable with our table. View was breathtaking. Recommended to chill out after a tough day at wor
5
we got mr.nabil serve us for the night,the most friendly and sincere staff i have ever seen. friendly and professional !thank you for providing me and my friend a great night.would love to come visit again.~
5
The choice of drinks is pretty great, overall a really nice experience out on the balcony. Would like to thanks Mandy (Lim) for a pleasant evening, she was really prompt with our orders and was very helpful and delightful
5
Was here on a Friday and the service was excellent. Classy ambience and great music really helped the atmosphere. Shout out to Nathan for his impeccable service
3
Tables are comfortably spaced for a good ambience for a business lunch or get together with friends
1
Had dinner there on 10th July. Ordered a S$135++ bottle of Beringer Napa Valley cab sauvignon. They served the one on the left (pic taken during dinner) which was selling at S$19.90 in local supermarket. Feedback to restaurant asking could it be they served wrong bottle as we know Beringer Napa Valley cab sauvignon should be the other bottle (2nd pic taken from web) which is better range.Yet they insist the $19.90 bottle is worth $135++ ... please be warned
3
The last time I visited the Westin this bar was buzzing... this visit at 6pm on a Friday there were only 4 others in here. I guess all the nearby bars with their happy hours have taken the trade. The bar does have an outdoor balcony where I think you can smoke if that is what you are after. We got good speedy service though, but I would expect that given how quiet it was. It was good for a hotel bar but I don't think I'd bother if I wasn't staying there, there isn't much atmosphere...
4
food is good, location is good, staff is polite, restaurant is clean, price is reasonable, view is goo
5
Came here for dinner and was seated by the full length windows where you can see the CBD landscape from up above. Really gorgeous! Service was impeccable, special highlights to Rupert and Han who were very attentive, professional and friendly! Top notch service :)Food was good but the dessert (toffee pudding with bailey icecream) was one of the best desserts I've had in my life. Thanks Cook&Brew
4
Located at level 33, cook and brew offers a stunning view of the CBD area. The bar food were innovative in terms of the Asian-fusion mix. Drinks were great as well.
3
This place is good for corporate drinks and functions. The view over the sea and port is amazing. Lunch was pricey and service was slow, but this is also one of the few places in this area where you can get a table right away; food (burger) was ok
4
We especially enjoyed the poutine fries. The black truffle chicken was soso . The dessert was great. Staff were helpful in giving recommendations
5
I booked my birthday here and everything was perfect! Let's start with the most important bit...the food. Coming from Chicago, I feel like food means a lot to a midwestern girl! The first appetizer reminded me of home, one of my favorite places in the neighborhood of Little Italy, but even better! I highly recommend the whipped buffalo milk ricotta with truffle honey and grilled bread! It is really not to be missed. We also had the dean martin shrimp cocktail after I painfully decided not to try the corn soup. So many tough choices. For our main course, we shared the surf and turf. The ribeye was cooked to perfection and there was hot english mustard on hand. The lobster was beautiful, large, and of course served with melted butter. Oh and those mashed potatoes.....yummm! After the food, comes all the special bits. We had the perfect table with an outstanding view of the flyer. There were a couple balloons and a card at our table. The staff was outstanding! Finally, they surprised me with a beautiful happy birthday dessert. When I thought I couldn't eat anymore...I was wrong! Maybe I should have tried the soup after all. Well there is always next time. I know I will be going back for sure! Thank you again to the cook and brew staff for making my birthday so memorable
5
Mandy served our table and she was so attentive. We sat outside, but she ensured we were not ignored. Her recommendations were excellent and we enjoyed her service very much. She also chatted with us to ensure the food and wine was to our liking. 10/10 service!
4
Reserved a table for 4 via the Chope App but the restaurant says they did not receive any reservation. Almost had to settle for an uncomfortable table but a table was free up at the last minute. Otherwise great food and sea view. I love the ricotta grilled bread and chicken phar
4
Loved the live band playing on Friday evenings, view of skyline was decent though slightly obscured by new skyscrapers, food was tasty and interesting on our first visit, service was great overall though I can tell it was a busy evening which was why some of our drinks orders were missed and it wasn't that easy to catch the server's attention. Not a big blemish, but would otherwise have been a 5-point experience.
4
We had business lunch and opted for the set menus. The food quality was of a good standard with the endive salad (tad too much cheese making it salty- personal taste) while the burger was well presented. I would have preferred the server asked me for cooking temperature though I know most establishments would do it medium for food safety purposes. Service by Caddie was courteous and prompt though I see some signs of struggles. She made sure we were comfortable and tried to make some recommendations. Overall a good place for business lunch
4
The Cook & Brew has standard menu selections and the quality of the food is good - especially if you like Western selections. Alcohol is very expensive in Singapore and this is on the "reasonable" side of expensive - if that makes sense? Better for a causal lunch than for dinner as there are many great restaurants along Boat Quay and Robertson's key with better night time atmosphere
4
Excellent atmosphere for business lunch. Service wasn't up to scratch as I had to constantly try and get service for water and orders. Food are drinks are tasty and standard prices in accordance to hotel restaurant standards
5
The corner table that's overlooking the Singapore Ferry was a stunning sight. Fantastic service by Nabil and his team! Food was ridiculously tasty
3
Honestly the food were too normal, the price is honestly overpriced.. we like spending around 150+ for two people in a sharing food.. however, I can tell that the view is incredebly nice and the environment is great.. just the food is not worth it. And not nice
4
This gastropub offers some surprisingly good food. My personal favorites are their burgers and whipped buffalo milk ricotta. Hits the spot every time!
4
Their executive lunch is at $35++ for 2 courses. I think their starter/soup so so only but their main course is quite good. :) most important is the view.
5
This is a great place to hangout with friends on weekends. Nice quiet ambience. Starwood members get a 15% discount on food and drinks which is awesom
4
went on a weekend ,great atmosphere and quiet slow roasted Canadian pork chop is amazing and can feed a whole family
4
Came here for dinner and checkout the view. The food was very good and also excellent service. The view was still pretty special.Would return again for sure
4
Excellent place for drinks. Good atmosphere and great selection but the house Viognier was a little weird tasting. Good service caps it off
4
Considerate and amiable staff, the manager was gracious and helpful. I loved the presentation of the food; the chicken parm ($28) portion was more than expected.Place was modestly elegant, tables arranged well and gave enough space.Would come back to try for lunch cos of the view :
4
With business partner.Found that the atmosphere, service, location etc are very good. The quality of food and drinks are also healthy, good and more than the average but not unique enough
4
I love that it is high up on Level 34. Unfortunately we did not get a window table, The place was dimly lit and had a nice ambience. However, slightly disrupted by big groups celebrating an early xmas. The place was cosy and unpretentious. No need to dress up to the high to get service. Food was pretty good. I really enjoyed the bread dip with ricotta and honey. Best starter ever. The turkey pasta was quite good and on the tangy side. Pulled pork with fries and gravy was enjoyable at first but got too salty at the end. Personally, I did not enjoy the masala clam too much. It was too sour and something in the spices seem to be missing. Cod fish was on point and very tasty. I enjoyed a glass of Chardonnay but did not enjoy my second cocktail. Too much basil in it. Not much alcohol. For dessert, we ordered carrot cake, pecan tart and sticky date pudding. The sticky date pudding was nice to look at but not really up to par with my expectation, taste-wise. I really enjoyed the pecan tart with rum and raisin ice cream, though. Not overly sweet. And went well together. Overall and enjoyable meal. Would like to visit for drinks and a good meal again next year
5
This restaurant is in the 33rd floor and will treat you to a good view of the bay in Singapore. The menu is mixed Asian and Western. I had the grilled fish and it was very good. But what I liked the most was the space. Some restaurants try to have too many tables, this one does not. We went at a large group and after we ate, we had space to stand up and mingle.
4
Dinner over here is a beautiful way to spend your evening dates! Food was top notch so as the service.
Will be back and recommend :)
5
Great beer from a variety of lands. Great food efficiently served. It is a large place but also has nice smaller sections for those wanting more intimacy.
5
I was very impressed by the menu and service we had for a group of 50+ business dinner. Steak was fabulous (10/10) but the vegetarian gnocchi was a (6/10) by comparison.
4
This bar has a generous sized drinks area both inside and outside with nice views of well..the container port! It has lots of whiskey options as well as beers on tap.The restaurant attached serves home style food. We had the 600grams (1.5 lbs) pork knuckle. Huge and tasty
3
In the land of glass and steel at Asia Square, this grill is a welcome respite to the cold decor of dark steel and thick pile industrial carpets. For starters, there is the warm tones of the wooden floors stained blonde. Wooden tables with definite casual cutleries set the tone of informality and enough distance to have a stiff business conversation. There is plenty of brew for the after work crowd but foreboding for the "must-stay-awake" business meal. The entrees were typical bar grill stuff - burgers for instance was overdone when i ordered it medium. The fries were stringy and neither crisp nor moist. You get the idea that the food is an after-thought to the drinks. Well, at least the business speak got done efficiently.
3
Had a dinner with several of my mates. The sea view from there is brilliant but I have to say the food and the service were really just average if not bad. I ordered a burger which was cold when they served me.Very average restauran
4
A steak & chops sort-of-place with cowhide barstools obviously targeting the male-dominated financial district of Singapore. There was one fish main and one vegetarian so the menu is meat-heavy but there are salad and soup starters. We found the chef's three-course set menu more interesting and creative than the a-la-carte menu and were pleased with our selections, especially the black cod which came with some steamed mussels on the side. The desserts were rich and gooey, chocolate and caramel-based. The view was gorgeous but the music was a tad too loud--a problem common in modern glass-and-chrome dominated restaurants. Would we return? Yes, but we'd be selective whom we invited to join us
5
I was pleasantly surprised at the food at the restaurant. Started out with a great crab and shrimp appetizer and followed it with a phenomenal steak that could compete with the best in Chicago. Has nice views of harbot and ann out dooor patio.Staff was very nice
5
Been to this place a couple of times but I must say that last night it was an amazing experience. The food and service were both top notch! For starters - the sticky beef ribs had a unique blend of spices and left you craving for more. The whipped buffalo milk ricotta and truffle honey was a smooth combo with the grilled tasty sourdough bread that accompanied it. For mains I had the Black Cod. It was pleasantly light and was a great dish to wash down with our bottle of Veuve Clicquot. In addition to the Bailey's cake which was super sinful, it was a sweet ending to the meal with the fabulous manager, Mr Thomas coming by to check on us and as always taking the extra effort to ensure we are having a great time. All in all it was an amazing night with the good food and star manager, Mr Thomas!

I have only been to Cook n Brew for after work drinks. Was a convenient location for us as we were based in Asia Square. Good view and everything but the service is really really poor. Appalling for a 5 star hotel. You can end up waiting out in the balcony for up to 15 minutes before a waiter arrives. Given the length of time it takes for him to get a drink from the bar 20 meters away you might as well order your second drink as soon as he places your first one down. After getting fed up with the service levels I have stopped going to Cook n Bre

The restaurant is located at the Westin, which has great views because of its location. But it has average (well cooked but unimaginative) food. Most of the dishes are cheesy or fried. Good with or after drinks, but probably not first choice for a meal.
5
If you are in Singapore or you are staying at the Westin, you should not miss a chance to visit this restaurant. The food is delicious!
4
Part of the Westin hotel however has a nice atmosphere and great views as its on the 33rd floor. Menu contains your typical bistro food including a nice selection of burgers. Beer menu includes a great range of beers from around the world.

This restaurant based in the Westin hotel has amazing views of the city from its 33rd floor up. The furniture and decor are beautiful! The burgers amazing!!!! I had the broccoli bacon and cheese! The service could be slightly improved but I did see training going on for new staff which is a good sign. Also there is a 15% discount for SPG members and that's free to join so it's a good deal!
5
Went for dinner and restaurant cum bar was packed with office crowd. Service was prompt and friendly- eager to assist. Food selection was decent but specialty I believe was burgers. Ordered Montreal Burger and Steak & Mushroom Pie. Both equally good and tasty. Ambience was a little loud if you intend to fine-dine. Music was played audibly at all times. SPG members entitled to 15% discount which was an added plus.Recommended
5
I decided to stay on and have dinner after an event as the views from the top of this skyscraper were undeniably charming and addictive after a couple of smooth drinks from their excellent beverage menu. The Whipped Buffalo Milk Ricotta with Truffle Honey and Grilled Bread was heavenly. This place definitely needs a special mention for their service delivery. In particular the Assistant Manager, Mr Thomas Chandra's service was impeccable and his delightful personality made our dining experience a wonderful one. His outstanding recommendations for dishes were really good and he was most accommodating in handling our queries seamlessly. He is absolutely an asset to Cook & Brew

Heard so much about the place of the great food and view! Second time there and they didn't disappoint me. Supposed to enjoy restaurant week menu but wasn't impressed by the food items, so decided to go ala carte. Staff Tri was really thoughtful and friendly! We didn't know what to order and he recommended a couple of the starters and it's good! Will be back next time! Request for table overlooking marina bay or just sit outdoor to enjoy the wind!

Went on a informal dinner appointment with some of my long term clients in the company and it was amazing because of the wide variety of QUALITY food to choose from. The view and the proactive + friendly staff team were another major advantage points which really enhanced our entire dining experience. One of my favourite restaurant/bar that offers not only fine food but amazing imported beers,spirits and beverage selection. kudos to the amazing bartender Sunny for the really special and delicious signature cocktails. Definitely a must try!

We had an incredible dining experience at Cook & Brew. Firstly the style and decor of the restaurant is modern but with a classic vibe to it - loved it. The food was a fantastic mix of local and international fusion food. In particular we enjoyed the 'Hawker Burger' - a beautiful blend of traditional local food brought into a new age. They also have a fantastic beer and cocktail selection - it might take you a while to peruse the entire drinks menu but it is well worth it. You'll find some great treats there

I was staying this month at Westin Singapore & thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel APART from eating at the Cook & Brew ! From the moment we stepped in to the last step out NOTHING was memorable about this restaurant.I advised I was a hotel guest & as a Platinum member I asked if any SPG discount - the look I was given should have warned me of what to expect ! NO SPG discount I was told & we were taken to a table without any view to which I requested a change - given better tables but not with the window view which I was told there were reserved - whilst we were there TWO remained unused. After food was delivered not once were we asked how was the food including at paying - in fact after delivering the food no one came back to the table until the bill was requested - it was less than 50% busy.Food very average with my sweet potato fries cold. Music blared out & very inappropriate - just loud elevator music & not in keeping with the image of the restaurant. I found the whole experience bad 
4
While the food is by no means memorable, the quality is very good and the atmosphere very upbeat and relaxing at the same time. Would not hesitate to go back.
5
So many choices and fabulous taste. Highly recommend. Service was friendly and quick. Great for business or pleasure.
5
If you find yourself staying at the Westin for work then definitely have a drink at the Cook & Brew,,,,,great spot, relaxed environment with loads of people having a good time.
3
We had a nice table with a great view. The service was good and the food was ok. The menu did not inspire me too much so i had difficulties to choose.
5
Definitely worth dining here great spot with awesome views and excellent food and wine. Great place in Singapore for just a drink or diner in the Westin Hotel friendly staff. Comfortable place to relax and enjoy

Visited this restaurant recently. We had the warm bread with Ricotta and honey, the pulled pork, chicken parma, and a chocolate cake with baileys ice cream. All were delicious. Service was also very attentive. Atmosphere was good and ideal for a romantic evening. Helpings were generous. Good choice.
4
There was a wide selection of alcoholic drinks.However, the portions of food were about average to small , considering the prices that were charged.The dessert menu could have been wider though.In all, it is a good place to unwind with friends and colleagues.A good concrete view of upcoming buildings with bodies of water around. :
3
I went for a work lunch. Despite not been too full, the service appeared slow. The food however wasn't bad. I won't be back - too slow for my liking for work lunches as they seemed to have too few wait staff. Also the coffee was horrible - expected much better for the Westi
5
A late birthday celebration and have to say I won't forget it.Was early but this wasn't a problem and was shown straight to our table with views out over the container docks .Every time our wine glass got down they were on hand to fill it up and in my mind this attention to detail make a great night a special night .The food was very tasty indeed and can recommend
5
Traveled to Singapore recently with my family, a friend of ours suggested to have diner at Cook and Brew, worth every penny, food was delicious and staff were very friendly and helpful, an experience I would recommend to anyone. The manager Anne and the entire staff are a fun bunch, who seem to be enjoying their work a lot! Very pleasing to see...will definitely go back
4
Great after work atmosphere and good food, especially the Chilli Wings and Singapore Noodles. Tiger and Kirin on tap...
5
Its a fantastic place. Wonderful view...huge collection of beers to choose. Foods are great... Its an amazing place to gather after work... Would love to be back again...

The food was so so.. Service was so so.. was a bit hard to attract some attention if you go on your own..
5
We stood in Singapore for a week. A friend of ours recommended the "Cook & Brew" for a nice dinner. We arrived at the bar a bit early and were welcomed by an extremely friendly host. The ambience was amazing, the view stunning. Overall great food, great staff! We will be back for sure
5
Great staff at Cook and Brew my wife and I ate a wonderful dinner.This was our first visit to Cook and Brew. Our waiter Michael Tam and the wonderful Restaurant manager Anne Drescher were fantastic, throughout the meal she was very attentive and friendly which made our dining experience memorable. My wife ate the black cod and I had the steak with stilton which were both delicious, compliments to the kitchen staff and chef.Great atmosphere in the bar with views out to sea and the CBD.People are all too quick to complain but I believe in rewarding good service, This was a great dining experience and I will look forward to visiting the restaurant again very soon

Came across this place after reading an article recommending the Poutine. We're from Canada and we're always looking out for this Canadian delicacy. We had high hopes considering this restaurant was located inside the Westin Hotel. Unfortunately, the dishes and the restaurant didn't live up to expectations. The Poutine wasn't really Poutine. It tried too hard to be fancy and lost sight of its rustic charm. It was over-seasoned and served too cold. The only redeeming quality was it's *relatively* cheap price point at SGD 16.We also ordered the perogies. They came served in an inappropriately large dish, which implied a very large portion. However, upon placement on the table, I was disappointed to only find maybe 8 perogies occupying about 5% of the dish. The perogies were flat in shape calling into question its true Polish heritage. As well, the sauce plain sucked and it wasn't very hot. This dish cost about SGD 28, which roughly works out to be $3.5 / unit - way too expensive!!The space itself was pleasant. It had a sort of English Pub / Lounge vibe with a great view of the harbour. The only downside was the music, which was dated and too loud. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place for the food. If they fix the music issue, it might be an OK place to have a casual drink. Note: When server asks "would you like water?" and gives you the option of "still or sparkling," "still" equals a $9 bottle of Fiji Water. Ask for Tap Water if you want free water

Took a sit, in a minute the manager took a menu for me by just observing i was looking for something. Waiter and waitress was attentive, helpful and friendly. A reasonable price for a comfortable and porch environment. This would definitely be my hangout and recommended list. Good job cook and brew
4
I found the found to be extremely tasty and available at a decent price inside the Westin Hotel. The wine list is a little pricey, but they have a huge beer solution that made the location a great choice to wind down the day. If you are a group having a dinner, reservations are recommended as it appears it fills up fast
5
This spacious bar with food is on the top floor of the new Westin hotel. The views are of the city and river. You can sit inside or out.We sat inside on the very comfortable chairs and Chesterfield.We had (quite) pricey late night drinks and desert and it was delightful until they switched all the lights on at midnight
4
Cook and Brew is located on 33rd floor of Westin Hotel in Singapore. They have a good view of the Ocean and the staffs are very friendly and professional. Salad, Soup are healthy with the right size where for main you can enjoy Burger, Cheese Steak, Pasta, Sausage and other traditional American flavours. it is good for dinner and you can enjoy a casual drink after work as well
4
The restaurant is spacious and has a nice atmosphere. Big bar, its actually gigantic for SG's standard. Really nice views and tables are far apart from privacy and they have nice couches
Our favorite was the pork ribs and gnocchi.
5
They did not cramp too many tables in the restaurant so make sure you book if you want to dine here. They do keep a few tables for in-house guests though. Food was good and service was alright.
5
From the manager on down the service here is superb. The food is also excellent, and we love sitting outside in the evenings with a drink and a cigar enjoying the view from the 33rd floor!
3
good ambience and view from Westin Singapore hotel; the buffets are much better choice if you are staying in hotel. Food here is just ok. You can do better.
3
This is a nice place to chill out with friends and loved ones but the roof top view is being covered instead of using glass panels so honestly it is quite a waste as you cannot see the view. Drinks menu are extensive and value for money given it's in a hotel! Try the truffle fries, they are good. Service can be slow sometimes as they don't have much staffs outside on standby. We usually frequent there on Saturdays, it is quiet and have a nice ambience. Recommended for those who just want to chill out and have a quiet time togethe

Have been to Cork and Brew a number of times (usually for evening social events). In the past two weeks i had luch meeting there. The lunch is very limited - only two sandwiches and a number of entres - and nearly everything on the menu looks heavy. On one occasion i had the burger (as did my guest). It was a very good burger - not outstanding, but good. On my second lunch visit i ordered the arugula (rocket) salad and plowman's lunch. Both were a huge disappointment. There were so many wilted and blackend leaves in my salad that i stopped eating it. The plowmans lunch was bizarre - old tasting parma ham, small chucks of cheese with too much rind and a collection of pickled items that seemed mismatched to the plate (pickled onions, sweet pickled cucumbers, and something else i could not recognize). i would have loved a simple pile of cornichons. The worst part is that everything tasted old - as if it had all be in the fridge for too long. My two guests both had the pirogue - a special that day and both enjoyed their meal. Service was fine as well.Its a shame, Cork and Brew is a great bar with unparrelled views of the Marina area. Will absolutely go back for drinks - but never for lunch. Really expected more from the Westin

Particularly liked the turkey balls served on a hot plate and the amazing selection of alcohol available! One of the highlights of dinner was their signature bone marrow - salty, jelly-like and sweet all at the same time - which to me was an acquired taste. It was more of a place I'd go back to enjoy 'live' soccer screening with value for money beers and a floor to ceiling view of the PSA harbour.

Cook & Brew is hidden away high up in the Westin in the Asia Square Tower, with glorious views out over the ships at anchor. If you like spotting offshore support vessels, this makes the perfect place for a working lunch. The restaurant is spacious and airy and wasn't crowded. The food was first class, with novel twists and innovative culinary ideas - some of which work, some of which fall flat. The prawn salad consisted of exactly four boiled and shelled prawns in a line on a flat plat beside a piece of charred lemon (not what I was expecting and not really a salad), but the white bean soup was exquisite served with sourdough toast. My colleague had the fish and chips which she said were delicious, with chunky chips in a galvanised bucket and mayo on the side.For dessert, I had the bacon and date bar in chocolate, the most unusual and innovative dessert I have eaten in a long time, with the saltiness of the bacon slices contrasting with the sweetness and stickiness of the date paste inside the chocolate. It was different and that dish alone was worth the visit. My friend had the sticky data pudding which was a very generous portion. I'd go back

Every time I entered Cork and brew I knew the food would be delicious. However I was hesitant to send it to because the service is quite slow and lazy. Four times in one week I had to find someone to seat me, find someone to take my order and finally find someone to bring me my check. It seemed as if the staff often disappeared and never return back after you place an order. One night I entered in after a long day at work at about 10:20 PM and they told me there were no longer serving because the kitchen closed at 10:30 PM I quickly pointed out there were 10 minutes left and I could order quickly and after a 30 second stare she chose to flex and allow me to be seated and place an order. I found this to be rude and unacceptable

The view, the selection of beers, the venue, ambience, service, everything's OK, nothing to rave about. However, the bar food....gosh, how bad can it gets. This is easily the worst bar food I ever had. Like seriously! It is really terrible. Examples - the potato skin, $8 for 4 pieces? The Double Crispy Wing - it's from CP. Is this tapas or what? The last I checked, this is definitely not a Spanish joint. Go for the drinks and so on but if you want a good laugh, try ordering the ridiculous bar food then
3
The design is very good, big and open style. They have a hot chicken wing challenge but we didn't try. We just saw the pictures on their wall. And the beer menu is big.
We didn't like the pop corn served.
2
A cocktail of all possible fat world food : fish and chips, German wurst , spicy fried chicken, spicy wings ....un imaginative and very fat food with not much taste .

Last min decision to have dinner on a Saturday evening (22-Nov-2104), so we just walk in to ask for a table for two. It was fully booked, but the staff was really nice to let us have a table near the window as the next booking by the other customer is 8pm. We arrived at 6pm (without booking). We saw recommendation from "Hungry go where" and ordered their "Good to share - Singapore Chicken Festival" which consists of Fried Chicken, Grilled Satay and Chili Chicken. We love the Chili Chicken best. We ordered another "What A Spaghetti" was also another recommendation from Hungry go where, I would say not bad. Can try if you like spaghetti. Service is excellent! Keep it up

Cook and Brew lounge, which has a lovely laid back, publike atmosphere. Service was excellent and the meal freshly prepared. Raw wooden floors flow throughout, underscoring the casually rustic yet sophisticated atmosphere.The menu features soft shell crab sliders with konbu pickles and honey BBQ ribs. “The Burger” topped with melted cheddar, pancetta bacon, onion rings, and a sunny side up egg; and the Sushi Bowl with BBQ salmon, egg roll, and avocado.You can also enjoy craft beers or ciders from a selection of over 100 labels from around the world.

I visited Cook & Brew over lunch hour with a colleague as we work in Asia Square. It's a big restaurant, located within the Westin section of Tower 2.The ambiance was nice and contemporary, it won't win any awards for style, but it was far from garish.Service was OK, nothing to write home about.Food was good, but I noticed the portions were not particularly large. I had a sea bass special, which was well seasoned and quite tasty, but lacking a bit in the sides department. I would order it again, but would recommend a salad or another side if you're hungry.I can't vouch for the beer selection, as we weren't drinking.Would I return? Maybe for a business lunch, but given the amount of options Sinagpore (or even just the Asia Square area) has to offer, I'd probably try something different next time
4
Located as part of Asia Square Tower 2. Abit tricky to find Westin Hotel unless u take a taxi.Nice ambience overseeing ferris wheel, MBS and the sea. Although the ambience is romantic and all, not advisable for first date due to the 'rowdy' crowd. It's more suitable for gatherings - small and large groups. Portion is generous! Definitely more than enough even for the big eaters. Draught beers are affordable! A recommended place for chillout. One feedback to highlight is the slow service! Need to buck up on that. Be more attentive.

The restaurant/bar features a rather casual, chillax sort of design and ambience. You get to dine there in a rather fuss free sort of feeling with either partial view of marina bay sands or the harbour/sea view. But having said that it's also a matter of asking for the right table. They do have alfresco seating and it can be nice even under tropical weather of Singapore to seat out there. For sports lovers, I remember catching English premier league game on the flat screen tv while enjoying a red rice beer from japan. There's quite a selection of beer priced around sgd15 or so and they do have a decent selection of wine if you are not a beer fan.For whiskey lovers, don't worry they to have a few labels and if memory serves me well... One of the jap whiskey can be found on the drinks menu.Food wise, I think they serve fairly good dishes. I did enjoy the creamy (cream was in the side) tomato and a pasta dish with mussels. Overall, service was attentive and pleasant and it helps that I wanted something easy and casual witha nice repertoire of alcohol
4
Food is ok. Service can be improved. Awesome view. They have a great selection of beers from all over the world which is great. Reasonably priced and portions are good. Weekdays can be packed as it is next to the business district. Weekends has a slower pace. Try seating at the terrace which has great view of the Marina Bay
3
Quite a nice restaurant but very casual . Service is lacking Food came out very quickly and was a bit of a let down Wings over bread crumbed , Seabass very small .No potatoes served with SchnitzExpensive for what it is , pub food View not great at night , outside terrace needs musi
3
The view is obviously a talking point - couldn't say the same of the service which is very basic at best - staff seem rather uncertain of what to do next... menu is decent if a little odd - this is a very convenient lunch spot but not a place to linger too much - the bar, a level below is far more inviting. Tried going back for dinner - called on a Saturday at 11AM only to be told by the Westin call receptionist that Cook & Brew was closed until 6pm and they couldn't take my reservation formally until someone was there - they'd call back after 6pm to confirm whether I had an actual booking... completely impractical and obviously meant we ate elsewhere. It would be very easy to implement a central booking system and yet they haven't considered this - speaks volume to how clued up management is..
