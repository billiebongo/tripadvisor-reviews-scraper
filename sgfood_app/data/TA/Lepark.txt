Is at the roof top. Food was normal. Three of us share a platter, truffles fries and a salted egg yolk buns. Is quite oily ..
Is a good place to chill over booze.

Loved the atmosphere. And food.
Real interesting food choices with the fusion and ingenuity with preparation and presentation.

Can be a little bit difficult to find but worth the search. Located on the roof of the People's Park Complex, this little hideaway offers some real delicious food in atypical urban setting.

This is a lovely lively little rooftop bar, worth the effort it takes to find the right lift to get to the right floor to find the right area of the roof etc etc. The craft beer selection is truly impressed he considering the bar is the size of a double garage. The bar staff are super-friendly and very knowledgeable! It's a great place to stop for a couple of hours to catch your breath, relax and reenergise.

Read a lot of good reviews bout Lepark before visiting and was quite excited when I finally made the reservations. It is indeed a popular hipster joint on level 6 on People's Park Complex. The food and service was good but with the crowd and live singing, my friends and I had to raise our voice to hear each other.I particularly like their chicken wings (the one stuffed with otah) and their plum sweet potato fries. They also had a wide range of craft beers to choose from and they are decently priced. I would definitely recommend a visit and if you don't like crowd, be there around 6-6.30pm as the place starts filling up after 7.30pm

waited 40 min even though cashier said wait time was 20 min. food arrived either cold or lukewarm, totally unlike food that was prepared ala minute. cold burger and cold cream-based pasta are horrible things. returned it for a replacement but crew was visibly unwilling to.music was too loud for comfortable conversation so we did not stay long. still, our length of visit was sufficient to make our clothing reek of grease.highly unlikely to return

Food (baked salmon, slipper lobster pasta, sliders, sweet potato fries) was yum! Love it! The truffle fries was alright cause I didn't taste any truffles in it except for the truffle mayo. We got lost trying to find the place. Live band on Friday evening was soothing! Awesome duo. Ambience was nice to catch up with friends

This place is on the roof of the parking garage next to the People's Park mall complex. We accessed it by entering the mall and climbing the stairs all the way to the roof. Once up there you'll see it across the way. I think the regular way to access it is to go up the stairs of the parking garage, but our way was more of an adventure! The atmosphere here is bustling but cool and relaxed at the same time. Prices are mid-range for Singapore. Save yourself the money and just get a jug of beer. Buying by the bottle is expensive and just doesn't make any sense. We also snacked on some peri-peri chicken nachos. The chips were nothing exciting but the chicken was very good. Best of all, it was off the beaten tourist track and felt like a locals hangout. Seize the adventure and seek this place out!

Love this place. It's a very casual venue with independent musicians performing. Pretty good. Takes a bit to find. Drinks collection is pretty decent. A wide choice to choose from. Came here on a Saturday and it was not too crowded. Conversation friendly and family friendly.

Nice hidden place to chill..located on the "rooftop" of chinatown park complex, it really offers a cool experience. They are offering many options of craft beers and decent food. Nice service and friendly staffs add up to the experience. Will come back again to chill..:)

Location-wise, it's not too easy to get here but it's an interesting trip making your way here, esp in such an old building as People's Park Complex.Inside, the music is just the slightest bit loud for my taste (makes quiet conversation a tad tricky with wonky hearing like mine) but they managed to create a good vibe with the drinks and food options (they even have a kids menu), as well as patient, friendly service (it's pay-first, self-service).I had a salad and 2 rounds of Asahi off the tap.The salad was surprisingly filling and very tasty. Asahi did its job as always.Other than a cool place to hang with friends, it will serve as a good place to impress a date. Read more about it and its various art activities/events - its even more cooler that way

Some people I met while I was travelling said they heard the place was good rooftop bar so we went to check it out.It is hidden in Chinatown so it is not easy to find (not sure I will find it again easily). We asked a couple of people and they were not able to tell us which way to go. Finally someone pointed us in the right direction and we ended up getting into a lift that looks like has seen better days, after a deserted parking. Then you have to go up a set of stairs (1 or 2 floors can't remember) to exit to a deserted parking again with what looks like the back exits of some buildings and stores.Finally found it. The place has a metallic door with a graffiti that says "Lepark" and we went in.Not too much people in the place, long wooden tables, chill atmosphere. I loved it! We could have drinks and snacks in a lovely environment, not too noisy but noisy enough to see that the place was not dead and being able to hold a conversation easily without the need of shout to each other like most of other bars.Would definitely recommend the place to have a relax night out with friend

This was one of my favorite places to hang out in the early evenings while in Singapore. Located in a tall Chinatown building (maybe called 5 stars?), we took the lift up to the top and found this metal sliding door with 'Lepark' spray painted on it.The place is quite big and has an excellent selection of bottled craft beers with pretty reasonable prices (for Singapore). Food was wonderful too - we enjoyed truffle fries the most. The greatest thing about this place is that it's pretty informal and completely unpretentious

I haven't been to People's Park in some time so the mall took me by surprise while I was tying to find my way up to Lepark - hodgepodge of businesses from travel agencies to massage parlours...Like some have mentioned, you have to take the lift to the 5th floor and walk up a flight of dingy looking stairs to get to Lepark. What wasn't mentioned was that the lifts shutdown at midnight and the main door out is locked. It took us some time to find our way out - guess we should ask the Lepark staff the best way to get out the next time. Lepark offers a good selection of beers and ciders, and only 3 bottles of wine - 2 white, 1 red so you know which poison to choose. The guy behind the counter was very friendly and offered good recommendations. Food selection is varied as well. I really enjoy the laid back vibe of the place and it wasn't crowded on a Saturday night. Perfect. We only had the truffle fries which was mediocre so we'll be back to sample more

One of the latest in a series of cool urban venues, in this case, not in the least pretentious, almost accidentally cool, with a series of art installations worthy of the SAM to distract the visitor. An evening stroll around the rooftop is also quite surreal, a little like being in a cop movie based in New York as you survey the skyline for possible escape routes.Accompany this with excellent, but inexpensive food from the open kitchen, an extremely well stocked craft beer bar, and charming staff, and you have all you need to entertain you on some random evening, or over lunch... that is if you can find the place. Discretely located at the top of the Peoples Park Complex car park, once you get to the top level, just look for the glowing pink lights - not so easy before sundown

The journey to Lepark start off with findin e way to e open air car park via a very narrow staircase and some photography whn the view of the majestic flat welcomes us! Me n my friends feel very happy and at e door of lepark as thr're graffiti with meaningful words on it! We were greeted by the drinks bottle on e moment we slide the door. Not only is this a restaurant, it is also a place fro artist to showcase their work and for the photos lover to snap snap snap ! I luv e lobster pasta a lot ! But spam fries are not fries, they are luncheon meat ! The interior very simple and natural lights aids in selfies too ^^

Visited on a Sunday afternoon during Singapore art month as there was an exhibition on. Most of the art was light based so we couldn't see much during the day and checked out the bar instead. The food is interesting and eclectic and the craft beer buckets are decent value (e.g. 5 Deschutes bottles for $50).Refreshingly underground (so to speak - it's in the middle of a 6th floor rooftop car park) dive bar in one of Singapore's most iconic buildings. Unique

Very nice place, hidden at People's Park Complex rooftop. I came here following the suggestion, and very precise directions, of a friend: you have to enter the mall, take the lift to 5th floor and then climb up a floor by stairs to get here. Food is good and fun. Good beer/ciders selection. The best of this place is the ambient and the mood of it. Very good place to hang out with friends

Not exactly the most friendly eatery I have been to, the restaurant left me with the impression of the title to my review. At 40 of age, I felt really out of place.Located right the top of People's Park Complex, you DO NOT drive up the carpark block behind the complex mall. yes. Do not doubt your first judgement of going up the building's carpark. Just drive all the way up and you will see the neon signage of it.If you are any taller than 1.7m, do watch your head as you walk down the stairs to get your car. Don't get your neck choked by the dirty net set up to catch any debris and dirt falling from the apartments above.The restaurant is being divided into 3 sections, the way I see it. The Main area, The DJ area, The forever raining Alfresco (with the aircon leaks dripping onto the awning overhead). The latter was extremely romantic in the night.There is no server for your food and drinks. You will have to place your order of food and drinks at separate counters and watch out for your number being called and flashed.It's a Fast Food restaurant! That's it! now I finally thought of the right term to use on this one.In all, it was unique and good. Food was decent. We had some nachos with chicken and a box of Spam fries which was stuffed half with paper wrappings. Will I go back again?Strangely, I think i would....It's a good chill out place to hang out with friends. The fact that there is no server, no one is going to come bother you and interrupt your conversations
