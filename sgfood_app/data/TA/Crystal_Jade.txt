Lovely dandan noodles, excellent steamed buns.
Would happily eat Crystal Jade Dan Dan noodles everyday if I could. Really nutty and spicy and just delicious. Pork buns are always outstanding too!
4
so crystal jade also has a bakery arm attached to the restaurant, called "Crystal Jade My Bread", not very original but the breads are quite decent.
4
Well regarded restaurant with excellent Cantonese and Teochew food. Roast meats, teochew braised duck, pomfret fish porridge and yam desserts are exceptional.
4
Crystal Jade never fails in its consistency of cooking quality food ! My dad loves the QQ noodles in the wanton noodle soup. Fresh crunchy shrimp in a clear chicken broth and QQ crunchy noodles that are soft and springy with a bite - comfort food for life ! The fish congee was also excellent - generous chunks of fresh garoupa in the typical super smooth porridge that the Cantonese are famous for. We also had the stewed beef brisket and charsiu noodle (both dry) and everyone went home happy

A sign of a good restaurant is how long it’s been around and this crystal jade kitchen has been around for well over a decade. You’re guaranteed good quality dim sum and local Chinese favourite cuisine in a casual and not too fancy atmosphere. The service is efficient without being great as the staff are generally busy ferrying around food and turning over tables. The dim sum quality is pretty good the prawn dishes we had tasted very fresh and crunchy and the noodles were tasty and not too oily. The vegetables were also not over done with seasoning so you can enjoy their texture rather than just the sauce. Overall this a place I’ve come often when in the mood for some good dim sum and I’ll definitely be back again.
3
We ordered Scallop Congee, shark fin soup, char siew bun, prawn dumpling, deep fried prawn in the tofu skin and two desserts. The congee was not good, shark fin..so so. We waited for about 35mins before we are being served. Prices are a bit overpriced and the quality of food has gone down. Maybe we will try out another branch
4
We're having a brunch at this Crystal Jade in Holland Village after our brisk walk morning exercises. This Crystal Jade is open from morning to serve breakfast dishes, such as hong kong styles congee and dim sum. We really like their shrimp fried rice, wantan shrimp soup noodle and a few other dim sum dishes. Ambience is pretty basic / average, with outdoor seatings. Prices are quite high though, I think little bit overpriced.
2
We (3 adults & 1 child) used to frequent this place in the past, but on our last visit, found that the quality of the food has gone down, presumably due to it being packed out at dinner time. Victim of its own success perhaps?Food:The dim sum quality is fine, but the fried rice is now of below average quality (fewer pricey ingredients such as prawns, just full of eggs, over-salted). The fried noodles with mushrooms were also of below average quality, with few mushrooms and nothing else other than soy sauce.Service: Too few waiting staff for the number of tables. One dish got lost in the order, and was served very late after our reminder.Would we go back again? Not in a hurry. Not at busy times
2
Crystal Jade has had a reputation for good dim sum dishes.The food is still quite good though below the standards it used to set.The BBQ pork roll and SiewMai we had were both quite tasteless,for instance.The service is terrible-the waitresses ignored us for as long as possible then were unhelpful when we made some simple questions about the dishes.The table was dirty and still not properly cleaned after they came to clean it.Annoying in particular were the extra charges.For instance we asked for two glasses of iced water (hardly San Pellegrino!) and we were charged for them.The rather tired pickles already on the table when we sat down were charged for,as were the paper towels
5
Giving this restaurant an excellent rating as my mum who visited me here in Singapore last December 2016 loved the Dim sum and she kept on craving for it ever since she tasted it here. An improvement though can be that all the staff (waiters and waitresses) would know how to communicate in English
3
Standards keep dropping .... as they loss many of their Chef....
Service also varies between peak and non peak hours.
3
The food is average. But unfortunately the service is lacking. They might need to train the non-chinese speaking staff to take orders better as they didnt get my order correct the first time.
5
Excellent Chinese cuisine with very friendly staff and very prompt service. The dishes were fantastic and great value for money. Highly recommend this restaurant.
5
This is my go-to place for comfort food. Quality consistently good over the past decade. Opens till after 12mn if I'm not wrong. My usual fav are the char Siew pastries, sweet and sour pork and clay pot eggplant.
4
Great place for Cantonese casual dining with wide range of typical Cantonese dishes and dimsum dishes.
Prices are reasonable.
4
We have been going to Crystal Jade regularly and we never grow tired of the food they serve. It's delicious!
3
Customer service is just terrible, there is maybe only one who really likes her job.. other don't smile, take orders in hurry, doesn't speak clearly etc.But it seemed they were extremely friendly for locals, who could speak Chinese..Also food quality compared to price is not good. My beef was floating in the fat and oil, and I just couldn't eat it.However fish and vegetarian food tastes very good! So I'll recommend to choose fish or vegetarian food, if you want to go there :
5
I've been here many times since I was a kid. And it has never changed. The Cantonese food here is decent for its price. But beware it's very noisy as people talk on top of one another. It's actually a very normal thing here. Also there are lots of kids that cry from time to time. So if you don't mind it all. Give this place a go
5
The food here was incredible - and well priced. There was not one dish that was not absolutely delicious. I couldnâ€™t stop eating - which is rarely something that happens to me. But it was just SO GOOD. The atmosphere and service leave something to be desired. But with food that good, who cares?!? We walked in on a Thursday evening and got a table without a wait
4
Starting off as a single site, the Lorong Mambong branch now encompasses three separate but related establishments - two restaurants (Kitchen and La Mian Xiao Long Bao), and a bakery (My Bread). This review pertains to our recent visit to Kitchen for a extended family Sunday lunch. We've always enjoyed coming here and although there are some limited fan-cooled seats downstairs, we usually make it a point to get tables in the air-conditioned section upstairs. Reservations are taken except on Sundays, so come early...preferably before 11.30 am. Had a dim sum selection and while the standard's probably gone down somewhat over the years, it was still decent nonetheless. Service was basic but friendly, and I was accidentally splashed on my back with some ice water by the waitress but no harm done
3
Food was as good as expected. Crowded. Looks a bit understaffed. Though we were served, my request for a cup of cold water was not given even after I paid the bill.
4
Although this is a famous chain restaurant, the quality of foods is very reliable. Various dim-sum items and good environment inside the restaurant. Especially the duck foods are tasty and recommended.
4
reasonable variety but some dishes price are on a high side. overall enjoy the dishes. just hope that they could have more variety cater to all the branches.
4
It's a charm restaurant with good food. The food is Chinese Style but not oily and strong flavor like the normal Chinese food I tried in other restaurants. It tastes delicate.
5
Yes, of course this is one of many Chinese restaurants, and yes I know it is part of a chain of restaurants. And, for what it is, it think it is really good value and I love the food. The BBQ duck and pork options are yummy, the asparagus with mushrooms and truffle oil delicious, the salty fish rice delectable and I could go on. Don't forget to take your appetite!
5
Food was good, especially Chilli Crab xiao long bao. If you do not exactly fancy spicy food, you could still give it a try.Salted egg xiao long bao was below my expectation, there were not much soup in each of the buns and the meat was kind of dry, compared to the usual xiao long baos.Ordered the La Mian with scallion and dong po rou as well and it made the trip there on a rainy day so much more bearable. It tasted heavenly! I could still remember that awesomeness 2 weeks now since I last had it.Great service, great food
4
The simple egg fried rice ranks supreme comparing with the once-renown Ding Tai Fung's @ Paragon Orchard ! Also, the vegetarian dumplings are as good as ever along with many other marvellous stir fried dishes and above all, diners are well attended to by sufficient crew... Never hesitate to have the next family lunch or dinner at this quality restaurant..
3
I've been to Crystal Jade in Holland Village 5 times in the past 3 years. It is usually crowded during lunch time, when the air-conditioned room upstairs is open. They close it after 2 or 3pm, when it is less crowded and you'll have to dine downstairs (no air-conditioning, fans only). Food quality of dim sum (dumplings, congee etc) is good and authentic, close to what you'd get in dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong. We liked their seafood fried cheongfun/horfun. Service was average during lunch hours (when they are busiest), slightly better later in the afternoon. I did find myself feeling abnormally thirsty after my most recent trip in July 2015, possibly due to increased MSG levels in the food
4
It's our regular haunt every month and we've seen this place grow from start till today.Crystal Jade in Holland Village has gone through several changes over the years from changing their fresh dimsum to frozen and the latest 3rd menu change (which seems the most confusing).The food is the same good quality, albeit the menu needs some more thought. We were both turned off enough to lose a bit of appetite just making sense of it.We ordered their Braised Brinjal and Minced Pork, Deep Fried Salted Egg Prawns and Shrimp Wanton Soup.....the Salted Egg Prawns, the prawns separated too easily from the batter...... and rice wasn't too fresh tastingService slowed down due to new service staff. They need help
3
Crystal jade standards have certainly dropped over the years and Imperial Treasure is the chain to go for good chinese food. Anyway, we couldn't stand the line for kiddy Nakhon in holland village and popped by Crystal jade for the dinner alternativeit's chinese new year season so we ordered the yusheng and well as standard dishes - roast meat combo, stir fried vegetables, tofu in claypot and sweet and sour fish. They were all ok/average, and hence the problem for crystal jade. it's not enough to be just ok these daysOverall, a rustic, ok place for a meal. don't expect anything specia
3
The foods are blunt.the dumplings look so aweful. But to be fair, service was quite ok so im giving it an average rating
4
Try to eat at Crystal Jade Restaurant. The food are delicious and savory. The price is affordable too. Friendly and accommodating waitresses.
4
Everytime we visit Singapore, we make this place a must stop for lunch. We always go during the work week so have no issues with reservations or service.The dim sum is very good! Also the fish congee and duck are nice as well.
2
We went to this restaurant late, maybe the staff was tired because we waited 20 mins to be seated despite the seats visibly available. Then it took a long time for some one to take our order, problem is they leave a menu and a sheet which you write the corresponding no. No one can explain the dishes.What we order was not available and what we finally got was pretty awful. It did not suit our taste. All in all it was a lousy dining experience in a fancy restaurant on our second night in Singapore. I would recommend you go there if you have someone who understands chinese food and who can help you order
3
Visited the restaurant at Dhoby Ghaut 1 wk ago..Very disappointed with their dumpling..its not tasty and the glutinous rice is so soggy..it does not have the shape of a dumpling when opened..the rice is drooping and the ingredients esp the meat is not tasty.. Really not worth the money..Selling at $5.80
3
We just ate at Crystal Jade Holland Viilage (we have come here many times). This time we found the service to he horrible. We ordered egg tarts. They indicated that they no longer sell these. Instead we had to go to the Crstal Jade takeaway ourselves and bring to the table. When our food came, one dish was not what we intended. The waitress was quickly pointed out that we had disordered and forced us to take this dish rather what we wanted. Very disappointing
1
Poor service and staff keep asking to clear table even my daughter is eating and there are still food in the dishes. It is even more frustrating that a staff told us off that others are waiting !!We are only there for about an hour and the waiting time for food is longer than we enjoy it. The total bill for this dinner is sgd170 for 3 of us and we expect some minimum respect as a customer of Crystal Jad
3
There's nothing really special about the Clementi Mall Crystal Jade - crispy roast pork OK, diced pork & snake bean tasty but small serve, watercress soup was tasty but ordinary by Chinese standards, prawn with egg & broccoli a bit bland, the best dish was a silken tofu that you'd think was egg. A la carte price was fair but the set menu prices were exorbitant - much better value ordering a la carte. Service was prompt but disinterested
1
I am conflicted about writing this but I feel too compelled that I must share our experience over the weekend. We have come here before and have found the food and ambiance to be quite nice but this past weekend was a different story.We arrived at 9:30am with our toddler and asked for one of the open tables. The hostess said they were out of many things and said we should look at the menu before we sit down. True enough they were but we said we wanted to sit anyway. We asked for one of the outside tables and were told they could not accommodate a third chair or high chair for the baby. We said ok and waited for an inside table and the hostess did nothing. We then asked if we could sit at one of the outside tables with just two seats and I would have the baby sit in my lap. The hostess then said not enough space (if you have seen the tables you know they are certainly large enough). it was very clear they didn't want us there and so we started to walk away and my wife then spoke in Chinese about how disappointed she was and the hostess looked shocked that my wife knows the language. We left and won't be back, but on the upside had an amazing breakfast at the Holland V hawker center. Truly a shame
4
The Good =)~Excellent chefs whip up great HK dishes.The Bad =(~Some dishes are meant for sharing & not for 1 pax, good to check with the waiter first.My Tip for future visits:~Try to avoid during dinner times which has a long wait
4
The restaurant serves mainly typical Chinese dishes but with a little extra touch in the preparation of food and reasonably good service quality, it is a pleasant place to have decent business lunch.
5
Fast efficient service and piping hot dishes make this a great place for a delicious Cantonese fare "fix" - Great for either lunch or dinner.
4
This has good Chinese dishes from dimsum to noodles, etc. But it is always crowded whenever we visit so prepare to queue and wait. Staff are helpful.
4
This group of restraurant ..have a wide range of cusine ..from very down to earth to the exotic ..better check on thier website before you head out ...extremely popular for familt celebrations
4
My son loves soup dumplings and Crystal Jade do them well. There is an excellent range of items to choose from and the pricing is good.
3
Popular with locals, reasonably priced, straightforward Chinese food...
Would go there again if I was passing
4
The restaurant is situated in the upmarket Holland Village area and serves fresh authentic Chinese food.. The lotus root preparation is delicious and presentation is excellent. Its a dish we never fail to order.The Hor Fun is also tempting and the crispy pork is a great accompaniment. The sea coconut dessert is a sweet finale. There's a chain of Crystal Jade restaurants in Singapore and we make it a point to visit at least one of them when we are in the country
4
We had dinner with 4 friends. We ordered crispy pork, bbq pork, steam fish, fried kailan, duckegg battered prawns, fried rice, jelly fish. The food was awesome, pure authentic Chinese food. The service was good and the waitress was so superb that she even cover our bags with napkins so that they will not be stained in case accidentally, someone spilled the gravy on to our bags. The overall service as great. We love to dine in Crystal Jade whenever we arrive in Singapore
2
This is probably the oldest and most established Crystal Jade, but now it's one of the most disappointing "fine-dining" outlets. It's ok that we have to queue for this seemingly popular restaurant, but to be ushered in like refugees, asked to order food quickly, and being served in a hurried manner AND worst of all, no smile, made one lose appetite. I'm not even talking about the weekend crowd! Worst of the lot are the managers dressed in black suits. The most friendly people are the older lady waiters. Food standards have also dropped, and mind you, I've eaten here since its opening
5
One of my favorite midnight haunts, Crystal Jade Holland V is the goto place for a bowl of steaming hot noodles & porridge. The beef brisket/tendon rice noodles( ngau lam hor) is outstanding. A bit more exotic is the carp fish skin; they used to serve it cold with sliced root ginger, scallions and peanuts, it's simply delicious
3
Had lunch there with friends. Food was just okay. Many variety sold out by noon on 27th Dec when I was there. Hong Kong style food. Located in few places in Singapore.
4
Lots of Crystal Jade's around Singapore and can't say I have tried them all but all I have tried have been consistently good. Best to go in a group to try several dishes.
5
Like every year when I spend my vacation in Singapore I have to go to this restaurant. Typical local food, fast service and good quality. Just love this restaurant! Don't miss it!
4
make sure you try the pau, carrot cake, chicken feet, porridge, xiao long bao and glutinous rice. prices are reasonable. plain water is chargeable though. end the meal with a custard bun with fillings that flows out the moment you bite the bun. yum!
5
You will find different Crystal Jade restaurant in different mall in Singapore. You will taste Chinese cuisine. They have great choice for different taste.
5
Probably my favourite place in Singapore for Dim Sum.
5
whenever I feel homesick, this is one place I will fill my stomach with food that reminds me of home
5
To make this clear, the dim sum my family and I ate was at Crystal Jade Golden Palace Restaurant at Paragon (shopping centre) in Orchard Road. Today is the third time we've been here and it's never disappointed.The service is always good - they serve the food fast, clear the empty plates etc fast and your teapot gets refilled regularly. Speaking Mandarin helps since the servers' Mandarin proficiency is way higher than that of their English!Now...the FOOD:The Paos - the BBQ Pork Bun and the Custard Bao have very soft flour that melts in your mouth. The pork is tender and not too salty, but the best part is they got the balance of flour and meat just right. Though the custard pao is just as good, I still prefer the ones from The Cathay at Cathay (which is also along Orchard Road) because the filling has more of an egg taste.Ha Kau - the prawns are fresh and juicy; the flour is not too thick, is smooth and soft.Pan-fried carrot cake - I don't usually like carrot cake, but the way it's cooked doesn't make it too oily. It's just a little burnt, and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients.Panda sweet potato paos - well because of Kai Kai and Jia Jia they have this. The buns look cute but my mum felt the sweet potato wasn't sweet enough. (What an irony.) I thought there was too much flour. It was ok overall.Chee chiong fan - the flour is really smooth and it can glide on your tongue! We've tried the prawn, pork and beef versions and they all taste good. (Plus I really like drinking the soy sauce.) The flour here is awesome!Mashed taro with pumpkin or more fondly known as Or Nee! - I've saved the best for last. This was the best or nee I've ever eaten because the yam paste was amazingly smooth and creamy (but not too thick) and the pumpkin pieces just collapse in your mouth when you chomp down on them. Yam affectionados, this is for you
4
Great brunch place, a bit like Tapas but very Asian dishes.Nice ambiance, good service, could have been better if they were less stressed. Lots of dishes to choose from the menu and would actually advise if you've never had Dim Sum to go with someone local who knows what to order and maybe with a group. Eating alone is not much fun because the amount of the different dishes would be limited and expensive. Dim Sum is a meal you want to share with your family and friends, the more the merrier. Asians would normally order at least 10 different dishes and everybody share !!!Vegetarian food is available on the menu. Try the desserts too !! Enjoy !
5
So there's a number of these in Singapore and I went to the one in Suntec.Service is very good, the setting is a contemporary Chinese feel, the food is to a very high standard and the staff are efficient. It's a good place for a business lunch as they don't hang around getting you your food, but equally don't hassle you out the door as soon as you're finished. Will definitely be there again (in two weeks in fact!
4
During lunch they serve good quality dim sum. The standard is guaranteed at Crystal Jade. Service is also generally good. Would recommend their Korean Ginseng Chicken branches for a taste of Korean food
5
We love Crystal Jade - find it very difficult to walk past one without popping in for some xiao long bao.
Never disappoints and we've been to most of their outlets e.g. Holland Village, Velo, Orchard, Suntec, Central etc
4
If you are looking for fancy and good Chinese place , Crystal Jade is your place. A very good variety of chinese dishes and extremelly tasty.
4
Crystal Jade @ Holland opens till late. It serves good congee for those who suddenly have craving for it. CJ has a wide variety of delicious congee @ reasonable prices.
3
Love it there. Maybe because they do it the Cantonese way, maybe not the best around, but it could be the better ones you could get at that price. Worth a try.
4
A good place for a quick fix for my porridge craving. Dim Sums are available during lunch only. Depending on the outlet you go, most of the service staff are friendly.
4
For great Chinese food in Singapore must dine at Crystal Jade. This brand has many categories and please be sure of what you would like to eat and then choose an outlet accordingly. For me its always been a trial and error. There are certain outlets which have excellent Dim sums and yet some dont have iot on their menu.food is consistently good and the safest restaurant to go to for chinese cuisine. I would not pick on any one dish because everything on their menu is goo
5
We used to frequent Crystal Jade when we lived in Hong Kong and I was delighted that they are as popular a chain in Singapore as well. They have many different formats for their restaurants, ranging from the regular dining experience to formats which are slightly more expensive and better done up. The food remains consistently good whenever we go, and therefore this remains our first choice when we want to eat good cantonese food.
1
Dine at Crystal Jade, Takashimaya, Order a Chicken with wonton soup, a bowl of rice and a plate of two combination of char siew & roast pork but char siew of sold out so change to duck but wanted the lower portion, told her in mandarin, my goodness, the Manager told me she don't understand what is lower portion(in Mandarin). Then told her is alright, I shall canel the order for two combination, just the soup and a bowl of rice.Soup came, but not rice, so ask the Manager, she said ok will bring. Waited for 10 mins my little girl almost finished the soup and rice not here, went to check with the Manager again she said sorry she forgotten.The company should send their staff for training for service and name of the parts of the DUCK.If I have a choice, this outlet is OUT of my dining list
3
For fast and decent Chinese food in the ever-crowded Holland Village, it's hard to beat the massively popular chain, Crystal Jade. From fried rice to dim sum, it's consistently good and the service is wickedly fast. That means, however, you'd not be able to enjoy dinner in a leisurely manner, hold hands and stare into your spouse's eyes lovingly. It's strictly dine and dash here. It's my default place for Chinese food when in this area if the crowd gets a bit too much - which is often. You do have to wait on busy nights, but the lines do move pretty fast
4
Crystal Jade Palace offers very good quality food though the price may be a bit steep.
Great ambience too.
4
Good food, good service, good selection of food and clean restaurant. I went here on a business lunch. It was a little noisy but still was conducive to conversation and business. I'd go back again.
2
We found the staff to be prompt but pushy. They tried to upsell us on every item. for what we got it was expensive.
3
My Chinese wife likes this place a lot. Personally I think it's good enough but I wouldn't distinguish it from many other Chinese restaurants. However I defer to her greater knowledge of the Chinese food scene in Singapore.
5
We go to this restaurant to eat Chinese food and we like very much and very good value. We think this is good place for visitors in Singapore and our children also enjoy.
4
One of the picks for supper in the west.
4
Typical cantonese cuisine and the standard fare from Crystal Jade.
4
Prawn dumpling, common yet rather difficult to get good quality ones. This restaurant is one of few that we proud to recommend for dim sum breakfast. My kids love the steam prawn dumpling and my mum like the carrot cake. Our favourite is the outlet at Holland Village, you can dine in at 9am and still manage to get your supper at 1am in the morning
4
My Chinese wife loves this place. I think that it reminds her of the old days. It is crowded, noisy, the tables are way too small for the number of dishes one orders, the waitresses are constantly putting dishes on the table or pulling them off; tea is spilt. It other words, it has the right atmosphere for dim sum. There are many restaurants nearby in Holland Village, but on many occassions this is the only one full of customers. I would avoid downstairs as it is too hot
1
A very strange experience indeed. We walked in to a 10% filled restaurant and there were lots of waitresses standing around. Menu was quickly placed on our table, after a few minutes, no one asked if we were ready. Another few minutes, we got impatient and started raising our hands for attention. Finally one of them came, we wanted to place our orders but she said we need to wait for this particular waitress to do it. We waited for quite a while, finally took our orders. Serving started about 5 minutes or more later, out of the four order, three arrived promptly. No sign of the final one until the other three finished their meal and the waitress came to apologise that they missed my last order. Waiting again. Ask for the bill, they charged me for the snack which they did not serve. Finally settled everything but overall a very negative experience. This is the branch in Causeway point, so if you want a good and decent meal, try the other restaurants......
2
So so. Can try if got not fussy.
3
Crowded, not bad in taste
2
Food is alright only. Not worth the price.
2
Very average Chinese food.
4
place is a bit cramp .. as usual crystl jade standard is rather consistent
4
My Fav as well as a good pal. Must try the "Lame" xiao long bao, the egg with scallops, & handful of others more!
2
Typical efficient chain. Their la mian varies in quality because the staff let it sit on the counter and lose the 'al dente-ness'. Good for the price.
4
I would recommend the Da Shiao Mian (not sure if the the pinyin is correct), the La Mian with Stewed Beef (the beef tendon very succulent and juicy) and of course the Xiao Long Bao
5
my favorite outlet!
5
my daughters all time favourite
3
Decent food
3
Good ....
4
great dimsum and noodle dishes with a nice vive in holland v.
4
mei cai kou rou in a hot stone bowl with a bowl of rice,good enough...!! :D
4
yummy yummy dim sum
3
My dim-sum staple.
4
Good for late night savoury cravings
3
Good for late night supper. Used to go there with Jasmine.....
3
Go for the Xiao Long Bao restaurant, which is next door to their dim sum place. The Peking Duck is really tasty.
3
was quite diasppointed when I realised that they changed their menu not long ago. (They cancel 1 of the desserts that was once in my 'must order' list). The menu features a few different types of ramen. However when we try to order them, The waitress notify us that they only serve the normal ramen. The standard is as normal. The desserts variaties is reduced, I managed to try the rice wine dumplings though and it turns out to be quite unexpected. As in the rice wine smell was quite strong and different from what I had outside. But overall it is quite ok
5
I love all the Crystal Jades!
4
Good service and dim sum @ unearthly hours. Good supper place.
4
I TRY B4 NOT BAD
2
ok for late night munchies
3
QUality of Crystal Jade was there but service could bt better.
2
Food is not fantastic. Not worth the high price for course-meal dinners. The kidney and liver congee is not bad though.
5
The XiaoLongBao is Darn Freakin' Good!
5
cannot go wrong with Crystall Jade chain of restaurants!
2
use to be nicer though.
4
Casual dining with great atmosphere of Holland Village
