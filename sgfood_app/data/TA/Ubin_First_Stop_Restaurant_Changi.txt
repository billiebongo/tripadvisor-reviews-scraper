We are two couples who decided to have seafood one nite at East Coast. We have heard of the Ubin name and thought we'd give it a shot. Turned out the experience was good, not bad at all. It was a Friday, and a chilly one at that due to the rain. We ordered 5 dishes (for 4 pax), all were reasonably good. Crabs, sotong and even a pork dish was on our menu. Taste-wise, generally ok. Better than average. Price - reasonable. Ambience - not bad too, with cool breeze coming in from the sea (just 40m away from our seat). There was also a couple whipping out songs on a minus-one system. She sang mostly Chinese oldies like those from Teresa Teng while the guy did his (also ) oldies (English)from Neil Diamond & Elton John. Passable vocals if you asked me. Service - I think they are attentive and quite good. Good ladies mending our table as they appear to be trying hard, I was quite impressed. Even the (China) Chinese waitress in her 'utmost' Eng was trying to converse with us in Eng and when she fumbled, she quickly ask around. Well done!Overall - must try

Believe in giving 2nd chance but really regret going back there to go through the SUPER BAD SERVICE again. My last month review said that would give 4 stars for food but would like to retract that as tonight we not only have to stand the SUPER BAD SERVICE, their food also a great disappointment. From the picture of the what looks like a small plate of fried cucumber, it’s actually a $12 fried squid. The plate is already very small & still it’s so difficult to find the tiny weeny squid among the cucumber.

My sister happened to buy the Fave coupon so we decided to celebrate our brother’s birthday here instead of our usual Jumbo seafood haunt. The service is mediocre. Staff are blunt and told us the pot of tea which is usually refillable at Chinese & seafood restaurants, is for 1 serving only. So no refills. And what was appalling is they told us they don’t serve water! They asked us to purchase mineral water $2.80. But the other tables had water served and we had to asked the manager why is there a different treatment? His answer was really unconvincing. “ by right we don’t serve water ....” wow, we didn’t buy that late explanation and he served us water for the kids. In any case we did order drinks and the lime juice was like super diluted. Plus I overhead the table behind asking for water which the servers immediately gave without saying it’s chargeable or they don’t serve water! The food was actually not too bad but the service and experience really spoiled the impression of the place. For sure it’s the first and last we will ever patronize this place. I’m sticking to Jumbo which as superb service and food. Won’t ever recommend my friends to try this place.

Went there on a not so busy Thursday night so the not too big restaurant was only half filled with at least 3 to 4 service staffs on the floor but can’t even get any attention to ask for chilli. After we finished our meal & asked for our dessert to be served, they don’t even bother to clear the empty dishes. Even when the dessert was served, they still refused to clear the table & placed the dessert at the far end of the table where there’s still some space. So they either expect us to move ourselves & our chairs to the other end of the table or clear the dishes in front of us & walk to the other end to get the dessert ourselves.Since we already bought the Fave coupon & planned to celebrate our mother’s birthday in December at the restaurant, and since it’s already end November, we are there anyway, we decided to make a reservation. But the staff use a very impatient & rude tone to says December still so far away, call back when it’s nearer. We tried to tell her that since we are already here, why not take the reservation, then she elevate her impatient, rude tone & repeat what she just said.All the above are just SOME of the bad services. Feel so wasted for a restaurant to have quite nice food but spoil the whole experience with bad services. Not to mention that there are more good, if not better food & service restaurants just beside them such as Jumbo & Long Beach.From my other reviews can see that I’m not a person to give negative reviews but this restaurant service really deserved a call out

Located in the East Coast Seafood Centre with views to the sea, this is a great place for seafood. We went with a large group of about 20 friends and had about eight dishes of which the pepper lobster and chili crabs were my favorite. Everything is fresh and prepared to order so there can be waits between dishes, otherwise the service is very good. Highly recommended

Families of five to walk and seat in without any reservation was fast, attended by a mid age ladies. Wanted to order some oysters but was told left with 2 pcs. Live sea foods range in the tank quite limited. Seating area was rather spacious, quality of the food was decent except the portion a bit small, price was reasonable

What a superb meal we had with six friends last night. The restaurant is in the East Coast Seafood Centre. Lovely beach location looking out to sea and with an onshore breeze-wonderful. The owner was a charming host. We had a tower of Singha beer, followed by another pitcher and a couple small bottle of wine. Great ambience with the live music! The Chili Crab was to die for as were the buns, the butter prawns and the ginger beef. We had about 8 dishes to share. The bill for six was a reasonable $361.

Intial service to get you a sit without booking was fast. However when come to food and ordering was slow. Only two dishes came after 30minutes. The price of the food were abit over rated as the ingredients and portion were little. You expect some some prawns in your seafood fried rice and yam cashew nut chicken but wasn't. It doesn't pitch a lot to be a little generous on the plate. Definitely not going back again.

One of the many restaurants situated in the east coast. And I am so glad i chose this amongst so many other fancy ones. The owners( mother and son) are there personally taking care of the guests maybe thats why we got a great meal at good value. I am sure others get too. The quantity of the food is also decent. So be careful while ordering. My favourite was the sweet and sour fish. Keep it going.

I happen to visit the Ubin First Stop Restaurant for a good Singaporean seafood dinner with some business collegaues. The food was really excellent and service perfect. This along with the smooth breeze from the sea only 25 yards away happen to the an amazing experience. We love this place and will return soon. The chili crab is the best I have ever had in Singapore

Amazing good local seafood and the restaurant have a really nice sea view. Good price!! I can strongly recommend to visit this restaurant!

My friends Andrew and Jane introduce me to this restaurant. They have visited it on many occasions in the past and wanted me to experience the atmosphere, the great delicious food and friendly hospitality of the staff.

This restaurant serves one of the best chillies crab with the hot bun .
Service staff very attentive . Crab cost $60 per kg but quality , taste excellent . Ambience is good , just a stroll from the sea side .

Food is comparable with other seafood outlets, but what really stands out from other outlets was the service. Would go back again simply because they put in the effort to provide good service which is rare in Singapore

Enjoyed our dinner. Though not as famous or crowded with tourists as the other seafood restaurants in the same area, the seafood is fresh and the taste is good. I would recommend their Mani-Cai vegetables ($18, not sure if this is a small or medium size portion) which is unique. It is finely chopped up and mixed with eggs). It also seem to be available here only as I tasted it for the first time despite being a local. I also like their deep fried baby squids ($18, portion is a bit small) and bamboo clams ($14 per clam). For the bamboo clams be sure to scoop at least one spoonful of the sauce from the plate and pour it over your clam before eating. For our dear tourists, just a gentle reminder to always ask the price of seafood in ANY seafood restaurant, be it crab, whole fish, lobsters, prawns or bamboo clams before placing your order. Seafood is expensive in Singapore and a whole steam fish may cost you S$100 or more if you are not careful in your ordering. Enjoy !

Visited this place n had written a couple of good review however this dinner was a tad too expensive . Especially the sea cucumber braised duck . It cost $80 for a duck with a few pieces of Low quality sea cucumber . Avoid this dish at all cost. Other then this , overall still ok
4
We had fried baby squid and beef with spring onion - very, very nice! But at $14 each a bit on the high side, considering the small portion. Additionally, the bill at the end showed that we were charged for the wrapped towels and the vegetable snack, which were placed on our table without us ordering them

We visited the East Coast Tuesday afternoon for a stroll along the sea front and Chili Crab at the Seafood Centre. It was still part of the Chinese New Year holiday and so there were lots of folks out enjoying the breeze. I love the fact that they have built one track for cyclists and a separate path for walkers! Well done Sjngapore!! We stopped in at Ubin First Stop - one of many options along the way for lunch. Given that crab was $68 a kilo I almost changed my mind, but we decided to stick with the plan and am I glad we did! It was wonderful. A little spicy for my husband but we were told afterwards that they can adjust the spice level! We had ordered a couple of other dishes as well, but when we go back, we'll just order the crab and extra buns if we need anything else. It's messy and takes forever to eat, but hey! When in Singapore!! At least they provide plastic bibs and finger bowls :

It's a delight to dine within reach of the beach and seabreeze wafting thru. Service was attentive but not obtrusive. We have patronised this restaurant since it's days in rustic Pulau Ubin and it's subsequent move to Changi point. It's now at East Coast near the lagoon hawker center.Quality of the food has been maintained - solid local flavours with introduction of some new dishes. We preferred to stay with the tried and true. Cockage can be waived when requested - which we normally do. Yam Seng

I've been going to this restaurant since they were located in Changi Village. They are now in East Coast (I have tried to change the TA map location to show the current location). Seafood here is fantastic. The crabs are always fresh, not overcooked. The chilli crabs here is extremely delicious! The lady owner is extremely accommodating & very friendly. The service staff here are polite and very quick on their feet. Never had a bad meal/experience here

Poor service, limited English, didn't have Tiger beer, charged for items provided without request (pickled veggies, wet towel). Best item was Signature Ngoh Hiang. Sambal satong was fresh. Overall poor food and service. Won't be back.

Excellent service! Very good quality of food! We recommend this place to everyone.
We had very tasty crab and desert made of avocado.

Really awesome place to have a delicious seafood meal away from the city.
Nice setting. Gives a really retro feeling.
Great place to take a nice stroll after dinner.
Prices are not too pricy.

Spicy frog and special fried rice were excellent. Don't be put off by the rustic chicken wire walls! Always have a fantastic time at this restaurant. Service was a little brusque this time. Could do with some customer service training.
5
The food was very good and fresh. I found it expensive, but we also ask for expensive dishes. We got crab, bamboo clam, fried calamari and scallops.

I am a single traveller welcomed into Ubin culture. Loud music. Excellent food and excited people. Wonderful experience for a lone businessman on a Friday night 6000 miles from home. Thanks.

The same Ubin First stop that stood in Changi village /Pulau Ubin for 26 years did keep up with their reputation as "FIrst Stop"Sandwiched between other seafood restuarants now in East Coast Park Seafood Centre, this is the one you should go, if you want value for money taste and food.Gone are the rustic charms found in Changi Village. Gone also the kampong house on stilts. Welcome the beautiful sea views and sandy beach, not to mention the Pokemon stop right in front of the restuarant.You still see the regular staff, and the family who runs it. My personal favourite dishes includes1) steam crab (the big ones are really fresh and the meat is firm and juicy) We ordered 2 medium crabs this time as the group was big so that there are enough crab pincers to go around. ($62 per kilo)the bonus is in the "chawan mushi like" egg that is laden on the big plate. 2) steam baby squids in chilli and bean saucea specialty not commonly found. great as an appertiser , but the gravy is also good on rice3) Fried Mani vegetablean acquired taste and unique vegetable not commonly found. I personally enjoyed it so much and cleaned off the plate.4) sambal chilli tua taoagain, fresh ingredients and thick spicy sweet sauce. the spiciness is rather mediocre.5) steam Gong gongcooked just right. you can easily extract the flesh from the shell and the taste is sweet. The best part is, you need not worry about eating the dirt/sand of the gong gong found in other places. There are none. Always clean and tasty.I realised that the price somewhat increased from when they were in Changi village(especially for crabs, where it used to be 58/kg)but the service has improved. plates are changed timely and the high ceiling of the restuarant coupled with the alfresco section gives the place an airy and relaxing ambience

My family and I come here often and every meal we have here is truly fantastic! The quality of the food, service and the atmosphere at the restaurant in East Coast (they have recently moved from Changi) makes for a great dinner experience. I would recommend the crabs (Pepper and Chilli), sambal sotong, fried pork, roast chicken etc. Can't wait to come back again!

I took my wife here after a recommendation from a local hotel that I was seeks to use to accomodate visiting company members.The meal was average at best, we could not eat the coffee ribs which were tasteless, overcooked and covered in some commercial Sicily sauce, even the maitre de tried one and agreed.The other entree, calamari tasted of nothing else then burnt oil.Chili crab was average.Service was good but the meals are iverpriced and very poor quality
4
My husband was very glad that it was opened on e 1st day of Chinese New Year. We have walked past it on several occasions but didn't think of stepping in. The food was fantastic and the service was quite prompt. Definitely going back for more

Sambal Chilli Crab.👍👍👍👍👍👍 must try. Salted fish fried rice 👏👏👏👏. Will visit again nice food good location and good view.
4
Crabs with salted eggs are usually great. Pumkin crabs is equally great. Fried meat rolls, chicken wings with prawn source are excellent.
5
Sheltered here during some very heavy rain. Had the deep fried frog legs, chicken fried rice, chicken with cashews. All excellent. Staff even lent us a brolly to walk home which we returned the next day.excechickenccashewskashe

We had a great time in Pulau Ubin then realised that the restaurants on this small island close at 6ish because there are no street lights. We took the ferry back to Singapore and chanced upon this restaurant next to the Changi Ferry Terminal. Open air and spacious with a view of the boat jetty, this was a wonderful find. The oyster omelette, salted fish fried rice, sambal kangkong, salted egg prawns and ngoh hiang (fried meat balls) were superb! The coffee pork ribs were tender but you have to accept the coffee flavour on the meat to enjoy this. The sambal chilli was exceptional so don't forget to ask for it. Chilled beer and a fresh coconut complemented the meal perfectly. Service was attentive and very helpful.
5
We had the steamed seabass (around 800g $40), king pork ribs, leafy veg, hot plate tofu and a Szechuan tofu soup. Food was fresh and good. Total bill around $90 for 4 of us incl 1 coconut drink and 3 bowls of rice. Around Changi Village, if you're looking for freshly cooked food in a non-hawker setting (tired of nasi lemak after 2 days), I think this place is good. Come earlier if you want to avoid the crowds

Had dinner with my family at the ubin first stop restaurant. Ordered steamed seabass, fried baby squid, fried dough fritters, scallops with broccoli and hong noodles.The seabass was overcooked and the meat tasted firmer than it should be. The fried baby squid and dough fritters were ok. The hong kong noodles lacked flavour and needed more tosses in the wok to achieve more essence of wok in it. The overall experience was average and apart from the fact that this place provides the option of air condition dining for seafood, you may want to consider dining at the food centre just beside

Before the long haul back to UK I always try and spend a night to detox at Changi Village. A friend suggested I try Ubin and I am delighted he did. A distinct cut above the Hawker Centre fare which itself is good this was excellent food at a sensible price in a lovely setting near the ferry port. Joseph and his team are keen to please. We had Lemon Chicken, Deep Fried Baby Squid, Dry Noodles with Seafood and Vegetables with Chillies washed down with a jug of Line Juice. All for S$ 45 (Â£28).

We have made a reservation at the restaurant for 7:30pm. We ordered the food but still got to wait for 1hr 30min for it. I am puzzled why we still have to wait such a long time even when we made reservation!Though food is good but it really spoilt my appetite

I shall say when you are in Changi area you must stop by this restaurant and try the delicious local seafood dishes. The nice scenery surrounds the restaurant so that you can relax both of your mind and body while enjoying the yummy foods (2 mins walk to Changi Beach). My recommendation for foods - signature chili crabs and fried bun, assam fish head, sambal fried sweet patatoe leaves and prawn pasted deep fried chicken wings. Seafoods are super fresh and the waiting time is fast enough. Me and my wife used to enjoy our evening together having great meals out there at least once a month.

What can I say about this place, slightly upmarket restaurant across from changi village hawker cebtre, that has the freshest seafood that we have tried, very local in style, with food that matches and beats most 5 star restaurants, we r coming back again. Service that is exceptiona
