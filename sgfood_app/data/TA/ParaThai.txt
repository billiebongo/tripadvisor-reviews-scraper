The pineapple fried rice is highly recommended.
The rice is well-cooked and fluffy.
Portion of their food is largely than those serve in most Thai restaurant.
Fresh mango served with rice is another dessert dish worth recommending.

Food was quite good although not the best thai food i have eaten. Service was a bit short-handed but can see the service staffs were trying their best.

Food is very nice and is representative of Thai cuisine. There's also a kids menu for non spicy options.

Miang Kham is a very nice addition to the menu..
Portions are also quite big..

We enjoyed the food but the restaurant was just too understaffed to be able to give good customer service which is a pity.

My partner and I waited for more than 1 hour before finally the dishes arrived. One of the dishes was not the one we had ordered earlier. Called and waited for a manager or a waitress to come but to no avail so we just went ahead to eat. Hunger was killing us already

My wife does not enjoy Thai food in Thailand, however, the Thai food from Para Thai suits her very well. We ordered few dishes for a family of 3 (Pineapple rice, samples platter, pork [neck], Tom Yam clear soup)Food quality is very good, we enjoyed very much, service of the staff is great too.However, we are quite surprised with an empty restaurant on a Sat lunch time, not sure is it a norm. We thought that the quality of the food here should attract more business

Nice feast we ever had although we noticed that the seriously blurred manager simply charged us for the water without saying anything. At first, we merely asked her whether the restaurant usually provided the "complimentary" cold water or not. And she simply walked towards the cashier counter then came back to put the order/invoice slip on our table without saying anything. Soon, her waitress served us a glass of hot water. We realised that the water was not free unlike the usual last time. Also, we did not ask for the hot water. So we called the manager to come back again. She realised what she had been doing and she took away the order/invoice slip
