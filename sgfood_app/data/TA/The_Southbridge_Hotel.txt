Nice happy hour. Beer for me. Very good Coffe for my wife and Moevenpick ice cream for everyone.
The ice cream was the reason of the visite.

If you buy anything and this place make sure you write down what you order - and preferably get it signed too - they are not willing to admit it when they do a mistake - and they do.

Just the thing we needed. Savoury breakfasts are not for us so was pleased to find a place offering pancakes for brekkers, quizically smack in the middle of Chinatown, a mosque and a Hindu temple!
4
Dropped in for a few drinks & snacks. Enjoyed the nice happy hour with Singapore Slings for $10. Also, if you buy 3 beers you get to spin a wheel to win a prize. We won a serving of onion rings & wedges.Ended up staying all afternoon & had a great time escaping the heat. This is a great little hotel

I stayed in the Southbridge hotel, and had breakfast once which was reasonably priced and okay. I had dinner once which was overpriced and the fillet mignon (28 dollars) wasn't too good, and served without any fries or potatoes. Furthermore, this place is quite loud, and aimed at groups who want to drink. A lot
1
My fiance and I am a very frequent customers from this restaurant. The manager always acknowledges us everytime we come and and we have not been very difficult and fussy customers. But today everything just changed. I was having my dinner today, 10 November 2017, and waiting for my next order, sweet potato fries. But that did not even arrive. The Indian lady staff totally forgot my order. That was ok as she was processing it again. Then, there was this customer that wanted to sit where we were eating and this male Indian staff could come up to us and us if we can move to another table??? Seriously is this how you groom your staffs? While eating asking us to move to another table? What kind of customer service is that? My fiance being in the F&B sector just asked me to keep quiet and leave. But I find this totally unacceptable. We had to leave without even finishing our food and my drink?? I asked the Indian lady for a feedback form and I wanted to see the manager, but she refused and acted very blur. THIS IS THE WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. What kind of rubbish is this?

We wanted to check this place out for the Archipelago beers. Unfortunately whilst the beers were good, the staff were from another planet! Despite being practically empty, we were constantly waiting and repeatedly having to ask for our drinks. No one seems to take any leadership here
3
Slow service, we ordered a simple dinner, pasta and pizza. The pasta turned up 10 mins before my partner√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s pizza. The waitress asked if we wanted a drink before last orders -It never turned up! They took my debit card for payment, I then sat there without a drink for 15 mins. I eventually went up to the bar to ask what the issue was.Pasta tasted okay though and at least they were open. Singapore/Chinatown seems to shutdown early so we were looking at going hungry at one point after visiting the night safari
4
A really nice bar and restauant despite the dodgy karaoke in the room next to where you eat! It has a gteat menu with pasta dishes, fish, meats and plenty for vegetarians. It is vety reasonably priced too and has a very good selection of beers. The service was excelkent, really prompt and friendly. There was a really nice vibe about the place and a nice blend of tourists and locals.A good option if you're in or around the Chinatown area
5
Pros: Love the ambiance, location is perfect (it is just in the 1st floor of the hotel) and yeah food is great (or maybe i was just hungry? hahaha- no it was good.Cons: wish it was 6-7 SG though hahahaTip: There are tons of other restos around (but since we prefer western brekkie this hotel resto is a good bet
5
One of my favourite place for dining and chiling out. They have a good live band and great food. Cosy ambience to chill out after a long day at work! !!!
4
Nice and clean hotel, resto have good food and there is band at night sing good song, so you can enjoy the food watching people walking very nice place
4
Great bar with craft beers and full range of other beers and spirits.
Excellent, food at a moderate price recommend the Rib Eye Steak fantastic.
5
Went he one afternoon whilst exploring the city, its very close to China Town. We actually took advantage of this venue due to rain ‚òîÔ∏è
Good bar, good beverage deals
4
This is a nice place to spend an evening with a few drinks, a snack and enjoyable music,
Recommended if you are staying in the Chinatown area.
4
great place to sit and chill and have a drink whilst you people watch and rest your feet good range of cocktails reasonably pricedkept meaning to try the food and the ice cream bar buit never got round to it so need to visit again soo
4
A very good place to chill - good location @ chinatown area. you could sit outside and watch people pass and listen to the band which is not too bad. drinks are not as pricey as other places. place serves food but we didn't eat there
4
The Southbridge hotel is a must visit in Singapore. They have good bar food and good steaks for reasonable prices. Nice selection of dragt beers from archipelago and a good whiskey selection and a separate whiskey bar. The main area often features live music at evenings

I have reviewed this place before but wanted to do so again for reasons that will become apparent. I was last in Singapore a few months ago and this place became my breakfast place as it was close to my hotel and pretty decent. It needed to be close as I had a herniated disc and was in much pain. I have since had spinal surgery in the UK. I walked back in today and the manager made a fuss of me saying I looked so much better and how happy she was that I was back and able to enjoy Singapore. I didn't expect anyone to remember me. I did remember the great service and great coffee and bloody decent pancakes. It's great to be back and even greater to give TSBH another five stars. I am now off to Phuket and when I return in a few I am booked into the hotel above the cafe. I chose this hotel because of the superb cafe service received at my last visit (think management should know this). Thank you. My only complaint is your pancakes and ice cream don't help my waistline!!!

We went here went visiting China town. It was surprisingly good value. The snacks were delicious and there was a good choice of drinks. Note: The barman does not start till after 12.00 noon so no cocktails before then. If you are in China town stop in.
5
Walking to Chinatown from the MRT station stopped in for a drink, was greeted warmly by the server, enjoyed a brew and a chilled white wine. Server was cheerful, knowledgeable, welcomed us to Singapore. Local craft beer selection. Clean toilets.

Perfectly acceptable bar in Chinatown
Complete cross section of clientele
It was Happy Hour here too üçª
4
Cool beer and good spot to hang for an hour or two. Happy hour with good selection of beers and snacks..
4
Good food, good beer, good service just a little pricey but worth it for a treat. My son and I had a short visit, filled our bellies with pasta, burger and beer but couldn't finish it all. Pleasant experience.
5
Nice concept of a restaurant with jazz music.
The food was delicious and service attentive.
Surely worth another trip for a cool evening.

The Southbridge Hotel is located at the northern end of Chinatown.After visiting the local sites within the area we decided to stop here for lunch.The hotel provides a large choice of menu items which makes it difficult to only choose a dish each.Instead, we decided to pick a range of food from the under ten menu, (meaning under $10).We shared, Spring rolls, Bacon wrapped Scallops, King Prawn Fritters & Grilled Shitake mushrooms.All very appetizing, well presented and good value for around $25SG.With finished off with a couple of the craft beers available on tap, while sitting along the front alfresco area.The service, food and drinks made for a relaxing and satisfying stop
4
The hotel is great. Rooms are nice.People from the hotel are very kind and helpful.Hotel is just next door of China Town (and it's subway station) and like 12min walk to Marina Bay.Also have a good bar/restaurant.Good place to stay when in Singapore

For the first stop of our honeymoon we stayed in this hotel to explore Singapore - and we would stay here again.Good parts about the hotel:- the room was very clean and the bed super comfy - it is indeed small, but that is no problem at all- the bar downstairs has really good, reasonably priced food and good drinks as well as live music- it is very close to the heart of Chinatown and the Metrostation so you can get around really easily- the manager of the hotel is very helpful and goes out of his way to make your stay niceNot so great:- at 9 am all the hot water was used up so we had to have a cold shower- staff is doing room cleaning in the middle of the night (2 am) and the locks have a high beeping noise as well as super loud locks. We didnt sleep though either night and they didnt stop going in and out of rooms right next to us even when asked- no specials for honeymoon-visitsAll in all it is good value for the price and we enjoyed our stay
4
Sorry Ivan meant to write this a few months ago. Although we were not staying in the hotel we had stopped off for a lunchtime drink and decided to return for dinner. The food and music was good but the assistant manager Ivan Low was great and nothing was too much. The hotel is very lucky to have a member of staff who works so hard and didn't have a problem serving, waiting etc - so thank you Ivan

I booked a deluxe queen for 4 nights.I stayed in a room on the second floor. The room was clean and small,there was no refrigerator.The location is good.It's near MrT China town which walking from hotel within 5 min.China town food street is located nearby.I'd like this hotel.See you in next trip:
3
We were staying in the hotel and had breakfast here on the 1st morning. The food was fair, but pretty standard. We enjoyed a few drinks in the evenings it had a pleasant atmosphere. Staff were friendly and there was live music.
2
A wait of fifteen minutes is not unusual at each end of your visit. No condiments or bread were ever offered. Service seemed to be a chore.
4
Went there a couple of times just for drinking. They have crafted beer, which are very good. Tried the lager and ale, I can recommend both. They also have a good selection of whiskey.
4
Very chilled out atmosphere, great food and great beer! Tried a couple of the craft beers while I was there. The live music made the night very enjoyable, will definitely return next time I'm in Singapore!
5
What more could you ask for in Boat Quay!! This little rooftop bar is very cool, views over the water and to MBS and the city skyline. You can even watch the laser show. It's on level 5 but all the surrounding bars only go up to level 2 or 3 so uninterrupted views. I really liked the drinks list - leans towards cocktails and spirits more than beer and wine but all available. Happy hour is till 8pm weekdays - makes he drink $20 instead of $24 but every bit counts. Great for friends, couples and showing off to visitors, not kid friendly.

Found this place by accident while walking in the area close to my hotel. It's right in the middle of Chinatown. It was quite the find for me. Very good quality food and beer, nice surroundings and it looks as if they always have 50% discount off the main courses as I have been back multiple times and the same discount always applies.I do like all sorts of Asian food but sometimes it's nice to have some standard fare Western food too and this place is just the ticket for that. Steaks, burgers, fish etc.Background music is nice, staff are friendly, food quality and price is great and the beer is good. What's not to love

China town multi layered place with an ice-cream bar outside - a hotel and a bar. The bar sets itself out to be a whisky bar but it seems more like a bar with a very good selection of whisky. The seating was cool and comfortable, people were eating and there is clearly live music at times. The whisky selection was good but it lacks the refinement and focus of a 'whisky bar', we had our order confused for a more expensive dram (shot) and a 'diet coke' needed explaining. The manner was short and abrupt and there was no whisky knowledge or chat on hand - nor were there any info sheets/displays. If you want a bar in the area that has a good range of whisky then this is the place - if you want more of a specialist approach with a better focussed setting then there are better places
4
The food was decent but the highlight of the evening was the band. Fantastic band playing until midnight. A good stopover if you are making your way through the Chinatown and the enjoy good music. The only complain I might have is the price of mocktails, which is a bit high
4
This is an excellent pit stop when you are wondering around Chinatown.They have decent beers on tap and an excellent selection of whiskies! The water of life:-))...Not forgetting a decent food menu.My only grip, the staff who attended to me did not know the whisky list well. I had to 'educate' her
5
Great bar on the corner of South Bridge & Mosque in China Town. Spotted this place during the day and returned that evening. Great atmosphere and a good selection of beer/food (not just the standard singapore Tiger beer). Really enjoyed this place and would definitely return
4
We were lured in for lunch by the promise of half price before 7 pm (food only). We ordered a burger ($9.40) and omelette ($ 5.40*)Both meals were well presented and tasted great. *plus 10% service charge and 7% gat on both.
3
Came here for a few delicious beers and a few nibbles. Food was fine. Beer was nice and cold and tasty craft beer.
Music was sooo cheesy!
4
Before 7pm all the menu is 50% off. There is a large range of food : pasta, baked rice, meat, chinese, salad. With two drinks and two main the bill came up to $35. The food is actually really good (as much rib eye than burger, or salmon baked rice). There is live music from 7pm
3
We stopped here for lunch on our first day in Singapore, having wandered through Chinatown. The service was a little slow but the food was okay. Nothing special. Nice selection of beers though and there are lots of whiskies available. The location is good, near Chinatown, and the open-front design to the bar/dining area is good. Minus one star for the intrusively large, loud TV showing sports in the bar
4
My first stop on my visit to Singapore was for a beer at this place. I was very well taken care of so I came back at least once a day during my stay, for a beer, a cocktail, or bite to eat, and once for dinner. it's an open front-end bar so you can sit outside or a bit further in with A/C, or inside in the restaurant. I found the cocktails great as a start of the evening. The restaurant has an international kitchen and the one dinner I had was very enjoyable.A friendly place with a friendly staff
4
After and hot and long walk, stopped off at the South bridge Hotel for a beer. A lovely open fronted bar, it has a small but lovely selection of craft beers, plus many spirits and wines. I haven't eaten but the food going out looks lovely and plenty of people are ordering. Generally recommended for a weary traveller.

This only pertains to the restaurant/bar (the hotel sounds nice). Do NOT order a cocktail here, even though they have them on their menu. No matter what you order you are likely to get some combination of lime and soda water, possibly with no alcohol in it, and pay out the nose for it. Normally I'd shrug a bad drink off but for what looks like a nice establishment it was easily the worst cocktail I've ever had in my life, the product of an apparent complete lack of bartender training. The whiskey and cigar collection looked stellar, so I guess ordering something straight-up would be safe enough. However the service was bad enough for me to not be back regardless, as our waitress continually forgot to bring our check and then kept my card for over 15 minutes. It didn't seem to be that busy. I was on vacation and in a relaxed, no-rush frame of mind, but it still crossed the line

This colonial style hotel is swanky&has friendly staff.The Southbridge Hotel is on the edge of chinatown,being just a 2 minute walk away.Western foods&S.E.Asian inspired meals are available anytime of the day&are safe&tasty,tho a little on the expensive side considering it is just a hotel&not silver service.The drinks a re swiftly served to your table or wine barrel.Wine barrels serve as tables along the narrow footpath&offer a quirky location to watch the streetscape.If your the type to settle in for a few hours i would suggest the local beer (Archi Peligo) & bring your earbuds for your own music as the hotel playlist is not up with the times or akin to the vibe the place could have.Despite these little glitches,we will return :-

Okay, I'll be honest and say that I only came here for a beer (especially since I had just eaten and that there is only so much food that I can stick into my belly), and the thing about the beer is that it is a pretty decent brand of craft beer called Archi Pelago. I had never heard of this beer before, but I must say that it wasn't bad at all. In fact I struggled to find any other place that offered it. Okay, there are much better craft beer bars around the place, but this one certainly wasn't all that bad

I have been eating here several times a week for the past 6 months. Imagine my shock when I showed up on 03 Aug and ordered a late dinner. Suspiciously, the place was empty. Everything was normal until the bill arrived. Although there was no notice on my table and no mention of any change in the menu, prices were up 50% across the board. If I had known I would have avoided the scam. But it was too late. There was a notice on some tables. Anyway, one meal that left a bad taste in my mouth. Never again. Avoid like the plague
