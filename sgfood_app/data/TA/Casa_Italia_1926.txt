We got the piccolo cup (single scoop for $5.90S) and a melon gelato frappe ($9.90S). Although it was expensive -- it was hit the spot after being tired, hot, and hungry after walking through the Night Safari. Delicious!

After dinner at Bongo Burger at the entrance of the Night Safari, we decided to have some Casa Italia dessert.
Mmmmmm... it was yummilicious! Nice Italian gelato. With more than 20 choice flavours available, you will have a hard time choosing your flavours.

One thing hard to miss on my trip to Singapore is their Coffee gelato! Worth to get it. Very easy to find, in the food section basement 2 of takashimaya. Notice also people like to get durian gelato...never tried that though

Although the ice creams and sorbets provided at Casa Italia are a quality Italian gelato, the prices are way over the top.At ten dollars each for a larger cup, it is the most expensive and overvalued we have ever come across in over forty countries
