Had the lunch set and every item was well made and exquisite - the side dishes were similar to the ones I had a few years back so it'll be good if they can rotate the menu. Otherwise, everything else was good!

A great place to eat with family! A very good deal for the buffet so a must try for all food lovers!!

Apparently, there is a more glitzy Rang Mahal restaurant in Marina Bay, Singapore: this one is small and offers "new" Indian cuisine. I and my friends ordered a variety of dishes, which I sampled. The food was average, nothing outstanding and the prices were disproportionate to the quality
3
I've dined here many times up until I was transferred to India in 2013. Now back in Singapore I thought I would have a wonderful Indian meal. The meal was good but not as good as I remember. The Dishes do not support the pricing. I arrived at 6 pm. The staff seemed unprepared for a guest at that hour. Frequently I needed to frantically wave to get the staff's attention. I miss the old Rang Mahal and hope it gets out of this phase.

The Naan was pretty ordinary. The plating was okay but understanding of needed cutlery wasn't. Service was a bit slo

We were staying at hotel and restaurant wouldnâ€™t serve us at 10.30pm on a Friday night! bad costumer service.. Disapointe

Our Singaporean friend introduced us to Table at Naumi Hotel, especially after a disappointed visit to Rang Mahal on Monday. Initially we did not carry much high hopes.The ambiance is relatively and to our surprise the service staff are much more courteous and dedicated than the one in Pan Pacific Hotel. We like the kulzza and the butter chicken.But at least we are not given the "you must write my feedback card" nonsense we experienced at Rang Mahal Monday evening.Thank you for giving us the pleasant experience
4
Contrary to the reviews of this restaurant, my dinner tonight at the Table was quite pleasant. Perhaps I was fortunate that it was a slow nite for the restaurant. The food was good and the service staff was friendly and attentive. The total bill wasn't too bad but considering the few dishes we had and only one yogurt drink, it can be considered on the pricy side. On the whole, it was a pleasant experience
4
I must say that the service here is impeccable. There was no such thing as a "no". When we requested something, the server went beyond and offered a suggestion. When it comes to the food, I have no compaints but it is not exactly very good. It is so so. The ambience is interesting/quaint as the restaurant is an open concept one in the lobby
5
Table by Rang Mahal was great on all counts. We were a party of 10 people ordering almost the entire Indian menu. The restaurant is a modern, tastefully designed space, that gives off a casual, but classy vibe. Vinod and his service team were attentive from the get go, and to serve a table of ten energetic people in high spirits, is no mean feat. I was impressed that they never lost their cool as they went about swiftly serving our food and clearing our plates between courses. We didn't need to wait long for our starters, which were all amazing, especially the papdi chaats n samosas. The mains were then served perfectly timed, allowing our starters to digest before we tucked into delicious butter chicken, dal tadkewali, palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, and kashmiri rogan josh, using our fingers to mop them up with an assortment of warm and fluffy naans. It was all finger-licking good!We brought a cake as a suprise to celebrate a birthday and Vinod actually helped to bring in the cake and lighting the candles, making great effort to hide the cake from sight, before handing the cake to me for the birthday suprise. Needless to say, we all agreed that Table was definitely worth another visit, or more
4
The ambience was great and they gave a complimentary brownie with ice cream upon request since it was my dad's birthday! Loved that. Food was good too

Located in Naumi Hotel.
Comfortable interior.
Friendly service.
Good choice of meals.
Short wait times.
Big and well presented portions. Tasty.
Not to aggressive on your wallet.
5
Great food experience, delicious tastes served with panache - perfect end to the day! And the Garden Salad makes a delicious light meal.
5
Beautiful tasting Indian food, great presentation complimented by knowledgeable staff .My wife and I ate there twice and both times the food was superb good portions great presentation and taste and not expensive a must try if you're in Singapore

Table by Rang Mahal is located at the ground floor lobby of Naumi Hotel in Singapore which is located in Central Business District (CBD) area. Nearest MRT station City Hall is about 10 minutes walking distance.We were here for dinner on a Sunday evening & though we made reservation the place was not crowded. The original Rang Mahal fine dining branch is at Pan Pacific hotel since 1971 & Table by Rang Mahal started its operation in 2013. It is a fine dining restaurant & serves Indian style food. There was a board outside which stated that during happy hours drinks are buy-one get-one-free.We settled for few Chat starters, Paneer Tikka, Frankie followed by Biryani & Chicken tikka Masala & plain naan. The service is good & food is prepared with consideration of international visitors in mind meaning not very spicy. The presentation of food deserves appreciation. There are one or two outdoor tables as well if you want to enjoy the balmy Singapore weather.Places like Marina Bay, Clarke Quay, Singapore Art Museum, National Museum of Singapore, Chijmes for late night partying are at walking distance from this location. Two nearest shopping malls are Raffles City above City hall MRT station & the other is Suntec City Mall

Table is one of the best Indian restaurants I have visited in Singapore. Food & presentation is good. Most importantly, service provided by Zul & his team is one of the best we have come across. We recommend Table & we will definitely be back again
5
One of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore. This is a fine dining restaurant referred by a friend and I was amazed by the great quality offered. The food is very tasty, authentic and gives you right in the India flavour. The menu is limited, but more than makes up with quality stuff and great service. If you need the full menu, then you can head out to the main restaurant. Enjoy the best food when in town
4
We enjoyed the restaurant for breakfast and one meal later in the day. We really liked it and it's a great option if you're not feeling like venturing to the may local places all around the Naumi Hotel area.
4
Located at Naumi Hotel, this cafe is anything but ordinary. We dipped thin naans in delicious dhal, chomped on scrumptious fish masala served with fluffy saffron basmati rice, and these were served with 3 types of chutneys. Presentation of the food was impressive and prices were very reasonable. A must try
5
5/5 for this restaurant. The staff is very polite, helpful, and nice. The service was perfect and it doesn't happen so often in singapore. All the dishes at once on the table. The food is very good fine and tasty. The price is correct. The design of the restaurant is very nice. Unique but maybe A bit cold - I would prefer table clothes than glass table, and maybe bring a touch of warmer color on the back end wall that has all the mirrors. I will defiantly go back again when I am around. Thank you and keep it that way.
5
i love the place.noumi hotel is handy to everything. bus station/shopping complex are all walking distances plus the bars.
5
Great View ....amazing must try experience .....should you love Indian cuisine....table by the pool. an uninterrupted view though high rise will come in way...but all in all great...
4
My Husband and I had a few smaller plates to share whilst having a drink at the bar.The food was flavoursome and the service was prompt.It was around 5pm so a little early to dine so the entree's suited us.I would return to Table for an evening meal again
3
When I order a biryani, I am always expecting soft fluffy grains of basmati, and intense aromas of spices such as saffron, cardamom, cumin, mace, anise etc. The more intense the spices, the better. I want an aroma that hits you with a strong impact, yet lingers gracefully in your mouth - even better if the aromas morph.Unfortunately the chicken biryani was far from the good biryanis I have had. The basmati was soft and fragrant, but the spices were weak and left no impression on me. I expected better from Table by Rang Mahal, where I recently had a fantastic set lunch which demonstrated their expertise of spices in their various dips and curries.Perhaps it was an off-day since I was one of only 2 diners there on that evening. I would return to try other items on their menu, but I would hesitate to order biryani again
4
I don't do reviews often but having read some bad dining experiences posts, I think I should stand up for this one. Despite my misgivings, I went ahead to make a booking and I am glad I did. The food was great with the service staff making good recommendations on what and how much to order. Didn't feel thirsty after the meal, a hallmark of MSG-free cooking.I was told that the same executive chef from Vansh helms Table now. Vansh was a fusion Indian restaurant by the same Rang Mahal group located at Stadium Walk which is now closed. That was 11 years ago and I still remember the food - check out the great reviews from locals in Hungrygowhere if you don't believe me. The service was warm- seems like a completely different restaurant from what I read in some reviews. Extra brownie points awarded for discreet waiters checking on you, refilling the water and having a chair to place my bag. Some reviewers said its expensive and yes it is but one needs to do an apple-to-apple comparison and also not forgetting that it is run by the Rang Mahal Group, a fine dining Indian restaurant.  Overall a great dining experience. My wish is they would include more fusion items and offering free pepper pappadam with that refreshing Indian mint chutney that they used to do at Vansh
3
Table has a really nice and calming ambiance. We were there for the vegetarian three course set dinner and it didn't disappoint. For starters, there was Tandoori Mushroom & Grilled Paneer; mains were Gobi Mattar, Dal Tadka, Naan, & Rice; dessert was a Walnut Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream. The flavours were authentic, the portions just right, and the service was warm. Dessert was the only non authentic part of the meal really, it would've been great to finish off the meal with an Indian sweet or dessert
4
Came here for lunch with my mother and husband. As it was Deepavali, we ordered the set lunch that they had especially for the occasion. We found the lunch to be both generous and well-priced. We had a choice of two appetizers each, a main course with accompanying condiments & rice/naan, and dessert & coffee/tea. The portion sizes were good, and the food was delicious - nothing was overly spicy and everything tasted authentic. The service was also attentive and friendly. It was a lovely dining experience, and one I'd recommend to anyone looking for amazing Indian food with an ambience to match.
4
Had a family dinner in the Table. Excellent, tasty, a bit spicy food with friendly service. If you want to eat good Indian food, this is the place
5
Took my chairman out for Indian dinner at the Table. The restaurant is on the ground floor of a boutique hotel, excellent classy decor and great service. They have a limited set of dishes - around 10 mains and 10 starters - however portions are very generous and the food is excellent. We had yellow dal, raita, chicken tikka masala, prawn curry, 2 butter naans, 2 rasmalai, mint tea and coffee and the bill was 128 sgd. Dal was excellent tasting and so was the rest of the food. service is excellent too - enough number of waiters around to serve you. The place looks classy too - so you can take someone out without burning a huge hole in your pocket. My second time here and would definitely recommend
3
Table by Rang mahal is a nice place but not exceptional... The menu reminds you of vansh at stadium (for those who frequented that place) and the taste is similar as well.  In this visit , we ordered 3 dishes and 3 were good, third below average- the sampler platter at 21 sgd is not worth for the quantity (1 piece of paneer and 1 small samosa with three small mushrooms)Chilli cheese kulcha is still good and worth a try .Service is attentive though they never showed us a drink menu ( probably we looked like teetotallers) Will visit again and hope for a better experience
4
I ate a business lunch here one day - excellent food and good value and a quiet setting off the hustle and bustle
4
quite and spread out...good authentic indian menu...kinda empty on weekdays and crammed on weekends...
good for meeting friends and colleagues..if on that side of the town....

A gerat in-house restuarant for this very nice hotel. Good food and a good atmosphere for happy hour.

I made reservations for 7 adults and 2 children at this place for a family dinner to celebrate my Brother 's bday . We had a wonderful experience from start to end . During reservations , staff asked me my preference for high or normal chairs . I arrived 30 mins earlier than my reservations with my 2 kids in tow . Staff, Mr Vasu and Mr Zul , took extra care to Ensure we had a great experience . First, I was provided a seperate chair and sofa to place my handbag . Then my active children were kept happy ( thru kind gestures of Yakult , and Chef even catered to my 2 year old's request to have plain cucumber slices !). Staff also made good recommendations on Good food , and dishes were cleared very promptly by mr Zul .he was attentive to our needs and even offered to pack for us extra left over food . Food was above average , and so were the drinks and desserts! Ambience was very peaceful , nice and kept my whole family at ease . To TOP it all , staff made a nice gesture to sing a happy birthday song for my Brother , and arranged to a small slice of cake cutting out of goodwill!! Excellent time we had there , good food and great service . Highly recommended . Price is above average but worth the food and service !:)

Thank you for the exceptional service we received at 'Table by Rang Mahal' restaurant while staying at Naumi Hotel for the week (our second stay).The breakfast buffet had an amazing selection of delicious delicacies. The staff went above and beyond call to make sure our meals were the best they could be...requests always catered for.Evening drinks were just as special.All staff including Wilson, Zulki Fli, Assistant manager Tony, Hotel administrator Daphne, treated my family with utmost professionalism. I'd be more than happy to recommend this restaurant to those wanting a unique personable dining and drinking experience.Sandr

We make sure that we have a meal at Rang Mahal, every time we come to Singapore, which is annually, and as usual it did not disappointment. This time we brought our daughter and her family, which included our 18 month old grandson. The staff were excellent with him and the food was up to par as usual; delicious. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, it delivers: great food, venue, service and welcoming ambience. We will keep on coming back - see you next year Table Rang Mahal
3
The food was almost at the level of the Rang Mahal but the service was negligeable, one girl that was not even paying attention to the scarce three tables. Sad to see such a great brand and reputation in meager hands
1
I was excited to try this place. Rang Mahal has an excellent reputation and I was expecting fabulous service and food. A two star hotel coffee shop, is what would describe the setting best. The service was appalling, the server made no effort to make us feel welcome and did his best to avoid giving us an suggestions for things to order. We started with papdi chaat - served on a side plate this was both unappetizing in its appearance and flavour. It was so sour, I had to give up after two spoonfuls. Our mainsl, chicken malai tikka, tandoori mushroom, chicken biryani, garlic naan - each dish was over cooked, under spiced and the chicken was tough and dry. The Biryani was more like a chicken pulao. It was swimming in oil, yuck. Some dishes on the menu were unavailable. Lamb Biryani was one of them. Stay away from this disgusting place. Never going back there - over priced and not nice
5
I think this is one of the place where I did not mind spending my money for a decent meal with a great ambience, customer service at top notch and friendly staff.I have to admit that I got a little shock when I saw this restaurant at the lobby. By placing the restaurant at the lobby, it didn't stand out as an establishment. The owners could consider placing the restaurant area on a slightly raised platform that clearly navigates customers from going to the lobby area.We were wonderfully treated by the staff. The staff spoke to us in our mother tongue which made us feel better. Food had excellent presentation, the chef has to be commended. I was expecting alot from the cheese kulzha. In the end, I was disappointed as it was a small little bite piece which made me craving for more. The mains were presented very well, with the desserts and the masala tea! We spent a whole 2 and a half hours enjoying our meal and having a good family conversation Thank you guys. You made our Saturday! We didn't feel weird even though we had the restaurant to ourselves for one hour or so. Personal thanks for following up on my reservation online

1. Ambience was good.2. Service was a bit disappointing though.3. Overall Food was average except Chilli Cheese Kulcha which was good (looks like pizza). 4. Desert section has limited varieties.
5
Ate here three times(!) during my recent stay in Singapore. Excellent food, interesting menu with a broad range of dishes. Very friendly staff.
3
We had lunch and dinner at the Table. The executive set lunch was good, but not very special. Dinner was less good. The selection of products was not special
4
There are some very pure-tasting dishes in this interesting Indian and Fusion menu, including some of the best rice I've ever tasted. Add friendly, attentive staff and sensible prices, and you have the perfect recipe for breakfast, lunch or dinner
5
We were recommended this restaurant by our concierge and we were not disappointed .We were surprised we were the only people in the restaurant but it was a Monday night..My wife ordered the vegetable Biryani as the Chicken Biryani was not available. I ordered the Mutton Bhuna with rice. We were old it would take fifteen to twenty minutes to prepare which was fine by us and it arrived within that period.The menu is not extensive like many restaurants in the Uk but that was not a problem for us . On arrival the food was well presented looked very appetising and we were not disappointed. My mutton was very tender and although no expert in Indian food sided to my perfection. My wife's food was also as she was expecting.The food was great service excellent and reasonably priced. The one downside was the lack of atmosphere due to no other customers but it was a Monday.I would most certainly retur

I am staying in Naumi hotel and ordered room service from the restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised by the good quality of the food especially since the prices are considerably lower than the Rang Mahal in Pan pacific hotel. The bryani was fluffy and fragrant, chockful of chicken and spices. Okra was cooked to toothsome perfection, with just the right amount of spices to bring out the flavours. However condiments like raita, chutney etc are extra and you have to pay quite a lot more for them.
5
The restaurant located in level1 in hotel PAN Pacific. Variety of Indian delicacies including panipuri are being served here.
4
I've been eyeing this place since i read about it around Christmas last year. And coincidentally, i won a voucher for a meal here at the office Christmas party.. so here i am!I had some mixed feelings/expectations from all the previous reviews i've read, but my philosophy is not to judge until you've experienced it for yourself. And i have to say they have some of the friendliest service staff i've encountered in recent times!The voucher included a set of Murg Angar and Tandoori Prawn - chicken was juicy and tender but the prawn was abit tough (perhaps due to its size) and a set of Tandoori Mushroom and Tandoori Paneer Tikka - both of which were below average. But the papads and naan made up for it. And the dessert of homemade raspberry and coconut popsicle was just nice to round off the meal.The restaurant occupies the lobby of the hotel and is quite open, but it is quiet enough to have a conversation. Good place for a casual business lunch or family get together. I would return again

Rang Mahal is well known for its Indian Cuisine and their sub brand Table serves really good food as well. There was a good variety of curries to choose from and they were all prepared fresh. The spicy ones are generally the tastier ones for me. The naans are really good as well, so order them and have them as a replacement for the rice which is expensive and nothing extraordinary. The place isn't crowded for a weekday dinner and it is a nice place to have a quiet dinner with friends. Some of the items on the menu might be a little too expensive for its portion as well. Service was prompt and friendly which made the dining experience a whole lot better as well

I had made a reservation for two people for breakfast buffet however when i reached there was no reserved seat for me.First i was asked to sit on a long table, then i was asked to sit on a sofa. Later when i protested that this is not comfortable, i was asked to sit on a 5 seater reserved seat, later asked to move by the staff.Here are the points of dissatisfaction:1. Staff had the audacity to plainly say that there was miscommunication and they dont have my reservation.2. The person of reception had no idea what i am asking for. I had to go to him to several times.3. They are doing a big bad service to name of Rang Mahal at Pan Pacific where i have had great experiences
3
Located in the lobby of Naumi hotel, the ambience is good and apt for a decent evening if you want to try Indian while in the city centre. The cocktails are good, tried basil fish for starters which was a little dry. Service is at a comfortable pace with the waiter suggesting the chef's specialities. Overall a good place to try if you want a laid back time....
3
Food was good however the cocktails were awful and the service was painfully slow. Drinks arrived as our mains came with the cocktails not being as expected.
4
Service was great !!!!
Limited yet exciting menu !!!!
Small and cozy place !!!!
Away from usual crowded area !!!
great place for family or small get-togethers!!!
5
The original sister restaurant is ridiculously priced. This place - oddly in the lobby of a boutique hotel- is great. The lunch sets are super value and we came back three times the same week.
5
Superb and beautifully presented food - well supported by local people and not just hotel guests like us.
4
I was staying at the hotel and opted for the lunch buffet. They serve Indian food and its definitely worth a try. Nice staff.
5
nice hotel restaurant with a good choice and great quality
very attentive and friendly staff, good drinks as well
2
--> Portion for appetizers were not good to share; staff should've advised better on how much to order. Quantity doesn't matter anyways because appetizers (chaat and kebabs) tasted poor.--> Curries were decent and good to share; although too salty. --> Breads (paratha and naan) were amazing
4
The place quite nice though we had trouble finding it due to nearby constructions. We ordered set meal and looking at the food we thought the quantity is very less, however it wasn't. The chicken and lamb were nicely cooked and taste was balanced. The only thing out of place, I felt, was fragrant rice (I'm probably nitpicking)
3
We were there for lunch today with family. They had set lunch to celebrate Diwali (the Indian new year). Sadly, it was very unimaginative menu for a festival - nothing special both in terms of spreads and quality. Spinach and Corn for curry and dal and rice for a Indian festival - festival lunch need to be special and different. this was the daily meal for Indian families on a normal day. At around $40 not a cheap option for a basic Indian food
1
I made a booking 6 weeks in advance of my event and confirmed the reservations 2 weeks late (4 weeks before my event). Event day arrived and I called again to confirm and they didn't have my booking. The restaurant manager was a complete a&^% and totally incompetent..... first he denied all knowledge (asking me to remember the person I spoke to), then he blamed me for the mistake, then he accused me of trying to make up a booking just to get into the restaurant that night. At no stage did he try offer any solutions until I started yelling at him. He then started to scold me about how I shouldn't raise my voice at which stage, I had to remind him I was the CUSTOMER and he needed to learn some customer service skills. Ordinarily, I love the Rang Mahal group but they need to seriously consider firing this guy for ineptitude or at the very least, take him out of his role and put him through INTENSIVE customer service training. I will stick to the main Rang Mahal restaurant where I know the service is brillian
3
Went there for lunch. Nice setting and had the executive lunch at $18 which is of incredible value. However i thought food was average, felt the chicken tikka wasnt cooked fresh as if it was reheated. Will i go again? Probably.
4
Very good food. Quiet atmosphere and pleasant staff. Good variety of dishes and those that we chose were tasty
4
Almost discovered the place by accident because it's tucked away - but a nice place to for lunch or dinner from work (good location), and good food (although quite heavy!)
5
This restaurant is located in the lobby of the Naumi hotel and it is really delicious Indian food - so convenient if you are staying in the hotel - but worth making the trip if you are not!
1
I visited Table By Rang mahal on 31:07:2015 and trust me it's just the wastage of money.Food-Pathetic Quality-Pathetic Ambiance-Pathetic Service-Pathetic (they serve onion salad with sweet dish) In short,it's one of the worst place I have visited.Nothing personal...but I found that the website they have designed is far away from the reality.They are just cheating people by showing their website
4
I like the majestic decor of the restaurant. it looks fit for anyone looking for high class indian dining. its spicy and delicious food are so gd. it has a lot of north indian dishes. I went once with a friend of mine who used to work there. he was a waiter. he recommended me the best dishes. till now i regard it as a branded and gd indian restaurant.
5
Have been a great fan of Vansh, the pre-cursor to Table, when they were at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, and especially enjoyed their Sunday "Beer and Kebabs" offers. Great value, good food, wonderful way to end the week!So, when Table started the "Beer and Kebabs" offers on a daily basis, I rejoiced, and made it a point to go there often enough to enjoy the wonderfully tasty fare, although it was not quite as extensive as the offerings at Vansh previously. Unfortunately, wisdom does not always go hand-in-hand with business decisions, and Table decided to discontinue the "Beer and Kebabs" offerings completely, leaving fans like me wondering what went wrong! Surely, they must have known that Table has a following of loyal Vansh followers who absolutely love the "Beer and Kebabs" offerings, no?I'm quite deeply disappointed, as, for a Vansh and Table fare lover like me, the cost of enjoying their great food just became that much more expensive.Bad decision. Sad!Bring back the "Beer and Kebabs" offerings, Table

The restaurant is co located on the ground floor of the Naumi Hotel, next to the famous Raffles. Set in an ultra modern boutique hotel with clean lines and not a hint of the normal Indian paraphenalia. With a tentive wait staff who are only to willing to explain the food and your choice. While the serving sizes are modest, they are by no means small. We ordered a selection of three with bread, all had different favour combinations. A relaxed atmosphere not to rushed we were given plenty of time to make our mind up. if you are staying at the hotel its 10% discount. A great find in local Indian food Singaporean style, give it a try and after head to the roof top bar for a great view(need to be a guest). And a cold beer

Had week end lunch with family last Saturday. All four of us liked it for different reasons except for one aspect which was common i.e. Food. The food was superb, ambience great and staff extremely courteous. While my wife and I liked the ambience, kids loved the taste.However the rice pudding or kheer, as it is called back home, seemed a bit stale and that was the only dish left on the table. I guess I will let it pass and try it one more time for sure to convince myself that it was a freak incident
3
Dined here yesterday with my family. We ordered sun dried and garlic kulzza along with vegetarian starter platter for starters, vegetable briyani for mains, bhindhi (okra) masala and paneer (cottage cheese) makhni for sides, dessert trio platter for dessert along with masala chai and Moroccon Mint tea.The kulzza, a fusion of kulcha and pizza, had tomato paste and garlic as topping. A total let down. The garlic tasted raw. It wasn't cooked at all. Tasted very unpleasant. The vegetarian starter latter had a piece of samosa, tandoori paneer and tandoori shitake mushroom. The samosa was faultless but the tandoori paneer marination tasted raw again. Turmeric was overpowering. The tandoori mushroom was just fine. The briyani was tad spicy but aromatic. Paneer makhni was creamy and the bhindhi masala was bit oily. The trio dessert platter had gulab jamun, rasa malai and sugar free popsicle cubes. The rasa malai was tasty. The gulab jamun was warm but rubbery. Definitely not the right texture. The popsicle had coconut milk as Base and there were cherries but the chocolate sauce didn't go well with it. A citrus based sauce would be more apt. The masala chai was awful. All I could taste was cinnamon! Worst masala chai I had in recent times. Indian food is all about spices but overusing the spice will ruin the dish. That's what happened when I dined here yesterday. Definitely not a star restaurant quality dishes. I totally feel the price I paid for this average tasting food is unjustified. Either they improve the quality drastically or reduce the price. Anyways, I'm not returning
5
Good Indian Food with Lots of variety and not too much graam masala. Taste towards foreigners and service is very good
5
Yummy paneer tikka and tandoori mushrooms! Good selection of menu and reasonably priced. Also a great ambience.Papdi chat not spicy enough..
1
Menu had items that were wrongly titled and the food tasted artificial and made from processed stuff only.
3
Loved the Aloo Chaat - delicious! The spinach and cottage cheese dish was average and the Lamb rogan Josh was tender but not above average in flavour.
5
If you appreciate an authentic curry this is the place to eat. Service was great and attentive. Menu is basically vegetarian.
5
The food is outstanding. Rang Mahal did a great job with this hidden jewel. The service is outstanding and the environment is luxuriously chill.
5
We had the optional lunchtime set menu while staying at Naumi. The food was exceptional, the service was faultless.

This restaurant is located at the lobby of Naumi Hotel off Seah Street. It's the sister restaurant of Rang Mahal, which serves good North Indian Cuisine, which is located at Pan Pacific Hotel. I always liked the food at Rang Mahal and looked forward to dining here. It’s always good to come with a group of people, so you can order more food items, share and enjoy more variety! Here are the highlights of my meal:- Kulzza: Fresh fluffy bread. We had two flavors -1) Garlic and Sun-dried tomatoes Kulzza: This reminded me of pizza, with the tomato paste topping. The kulzza is cut into slim slices, so its easy to hold and eat.2) Chilli Cheese Kulzza: Kulzza topped with old yellow cheddar cheese with a chilli paste. I preferred this more than the garlic and sun-dried version. It's nice eaten on its own. It's like cheese on a prata, much like pizza. There's a s bowl of piquant chilli paste which you can add to your pizza. It gives a punch but its good! - Guava Chaat: Chaat is a savoury snack. This is a fruity chaat, which has thick chunks of guava mixed with spices and topped with pomegranate bits. It has a mildly spicy taste and the pomegranate gave a crunchy sweet taste to each mouthful. - Prawn Chaat: The prawns were sautéed with onions and placed in an edible papadam bowl. It came with a side of garden salad with balsamic dressing. I liked the prawns, which were fresh and meat is firm. Taste was also good. - Classic Mumbai Frankie: This was a roll stuffed with mashed potatoes and onions and sprinkled with chaat masala. I loved this more than the Chicken Frankie (below). It reminds me a lot of masala thosai, except its less spicy and the outer wrap is thicker prata. - Chicken Frankie: Diced chicken cooked with onion and garlic and served on a rolled parata. - Lamb Dum Briyani: Lamb cubes cooked with basmatic rice flavored with saffron and mint. The rice is more moist than the biryani I have had before. The lamb was cut into 2.5cm cubes and cooked in the rice. The meat is well marinated and flavourful. Its served in ceramic pot and the portion is good to share amongst 4 pax.- Dessert: We had a trio of dessert - Gulab Jamun, Rasmalai and Table's Ice Popsicle. My personal favorite here was the Gulab Jamon, which is shaped like a mini cocktail sausage instead of the traditional sphere shape. Served warm in syrup and topped with almond flakes. The Rasmalai was also good. Its a milk dessert and I liked it. The Table Ice Popsicle is like an ice cream with berries. Cool refreshing dessert. Overall a good trio of desserts.I ended the meal with a Masala Chai, which was made to order, as it took 10 minutes for it to come. It's aromatic and the tea was a good ending to a good meal.What we ate are from the ala carte menu. For lunch, the restaurant also have a good set lunch at $18, where you have a choice of meat/ vegetarian main course with 3 types of naan, saffron rice, dhal and veggies. I will come by to try their set lunch soon. Try it

Dishes are great and very different to the common Indian restaurants. It's upper class (price) but worth it. It's very vegetarian friendly and dishes with meat are marked.I liked the Bombay Pani Puri, crunchy semolina puffs with chilled spice water and sweet tamarind chutney. It's a very interesting dish with excellent presentations.Main dishes are good too.I achieve five stars, services can improve a bit. It was ok, but could fit a bit more the general ambient. Its Singaporean 'efficient'

I just loved this place. The ambience, the food, the service. Everything was terrific. The much loved tandoor mushrooms that came with the set lunch were yum! Would definitely go there again.

I ate here whilst staying at the Naumi Hotel and was pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious and I liked that there were so many vegetarian options on the menu. I was also unsure about it as the restaurant was virtually empty the night I was there but I think it's purely because of its location. The food was served quickly and the portions were so generous that I had to take away my leftovers (just as delicious the next day!). I highly recommend Table if you like good quality Indian food in a quiet, spacious setting, whether you're staying at the hotel or not

Having just arrived after a long haul flight and staying at the Naumi we decided to have dinner in the hotel. The Restaurant is open plan to the reception area which seems a bit strange. Having said that the staff are all very attentive and our waiter advised that all dishes could be shared. The chicken biryanni was excellent and the naan bread was the best that we have had in a long time.We also had the buffet breakfasts which had a good selection

We ate at Table on several occasions and thought the menu variety was great and the food simply delicious. It's a bit on the pricier side but the food was well executed and felt very healthy. My only grip was the 'homemade' raspberry and coconut popsicle which was very amateurish and icy and at $14 totally over-priced. The wine was also very pricey with ridiculous mark-ups on quite average NZ wines. Overall though very yummy food

Reasonably priced (for Singapore) very minimalist hip attractive indian restaurant near the Intercontinental Hotel. Initially put off by the fact that the place was totally empty, but we decided to give it a shot since the reviews on Yelp looked pretty good. We had a variety of curries (chicken and shrimp) dal and vegetables that all tasted wonderful. The flavors of each dish were quite complex, and did not overlap with each other, giving our palates a wonderful culinary experience. The nan (plain and garlic) were perfect, with that flaky character not often achieved. The service was very attentive. All three of us gave this restaurant very high marks (would have given it five stars but for the high prices); you will enjoy this establishment in the Naumi Hotel

Since i was travelling alone, i decided to order room service for dinner. I had a Cheese Chilli Kulza (as mentioned on their menu) and Punjabi Samosa, both the dishes were served hot and were very tasty. The buffet breakfast served next day also was great. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all interested in good Indian Cuisine

For more reviews, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatIndian Fine Dining is a rarity in Singapore and one of the famous one is no other than Rang Mahal at the swanky Pan Pacific Hotel. Well, there's no need to break the bank though as Rang Mahal has opened a younger and more contemporary sister restaurant at Naumi Hotel. Table by Rang Mahal is a relaxed bistro-style dining concept from the award winning group.V and i started with a clear asparagus soup (a little salty for our liking) and the Chilli Cheese Kulzza. The fresh fluffy bread packed with mild yellow cheddar, piquant chili and fresh coriander was extremely addictive and tasted way better than it looked.We then sampled the Executive Set Lunch which is available in both non-vegetarian and vegetarian options. The dishes were elegantly presented on a wooden tray and i liked that the portions weren't huge and there is a variety of items. Each set is served with a choice of naan and comes with some sides. From left to right): Dal Tadkewali- yellow lentils tempered with onion, tomato and cumin; Brown and red rice pilaf with cumin and Gobi Matter- cauliflower tossed with peas, ginger and coriander. The rice was the most boring of the lot.Here is the Tandoori Mushroom and Tandoori Paneer Tikka (foreground). I loved the fresh button mushroom in herbed spice yogurt (very creamy) but the paneer (Indian cottage cheese) was rather plain imo. I would have preferred it cooked with creamy spinach (call me boring but wev).The non veg version: Murg Angar and Tandoori prawn. Tender cubes of chicken in a yogurt and red chili marinade. The tiger prawn is a little on the dry side but kinda expected as it had undergone the tandoori treatment.I must say that Table does really good breads. The naans were also irresistible and i keep mopping the lentils up with them. I wished there were other gravy though. A wholesome five grain flour is used to prepare the naan (quinoa, soya, ragi, sorghum and gram).We ended the meal with some Tableâ€™s Pop, a sugar-free popsicle made with fresh raspberry and coconut infused with chia seeds. I never quite enjoyed the iciness of popsicles as it kinda compromises on the robustness of the flavors.The Masala tea rounded up the meal nicely. Rich, thick and flavorful but there could always be more spice.As Table by Rang Mahal is the resident restaurant of Naumi Hotel, it does everything from breakfast to supper and drinks and includes international fare as well. The buffet breakfast is priced at $22/pax, while the executive set lunch is priced at only $15/pax. Do check them out if you're looking for a different Indian cuisine dining experience from the usual greasy hawker spots

I was taken aback when I got to the tiny front of a design hotel and they told me that the lobby was the restaurant... But the attentive service and the delicate renditions of Indian classics made up for the initial awkwardness. I was alone and an early diner, but the service did everything to make me feel comfortable, including providing a half portion of a kebab so I could try more dishes. Don't miss the delightful Eggplant curry in a tomato sauce with just a hint of ginger...yummy. The ambiance is not very cosy (with hotel guests dragging luggage and conducting their hectic business next to the tables), but it is also not stiff or overly formal which was just fine for a gourmet treat

Comparably more affordable than Rang Mahal at Pan Pacific Hotel, Table by Rang Mahal serves similar high standard authentic Indian specialties with an attentive group of staff. Try the Chili Cheese Kulzza ($6), which is a simple fluffy pita-ish crust with good portions of cheddar cheese, sprinkled with coriander and chili. Chicken tandor and prawns were average though, nothing too fancy.Also really loved the Table Pop (dessert) and Masala Tea. My only quip was 4-5 different staff kept asking us how was the food, which is nice at the beginning but a bit excessive after the 3rd time.
