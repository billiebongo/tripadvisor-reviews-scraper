Yusheng was lousy. The carrots and radish were so thick, the salmon was so little, the sauce was not flavorful. The roast chicken and roast pork were good, the oyster omelette UFO was nothing impressive. The Hokkien noodles was average.

Service was good. Attentive to detail and polite service staff. Food was average. The food was a bit pricey for zichar food.

Perfect for family dinners. Inspite of some of the gimmicky dishes, they still tasted well and are affordably priced.
5
Good food served at the restaurant. Do go early if not will have to wait slightly long due to the dinner crowd.

If you fancy traditional Hokkien food which taste like those cooked by your mum or grandma, this is the place to go. Price is reasonable as well. We were seated outdoor and grabbing the attention of the service staff was a chore.

Hokkien restaurant that serves average hokkien cuisine but reasonable price and good service for a family meal.

Nice, traditional Hokkien dining in simple, casual setting. Enjoyed the DIY popiah, oyster omelette & braised pork buns. Roasted duck reasonably priced. Flaming Chicken presented an interesting serving spectacle although taste-wise, was somewhat forgettable.

Traditional food in a casual family setting. Flaming chicken is exciting and actually tasted nice and tender.

Came across this place while we were checking out Bedok Central dinner spots. Saw Straits Timesâ€™s Wong Ah Yoke review on their restaurant window & decided to give them a try.Their signature dish stewed pork was sinfully delicious: the melt-in-your-mouth pork belly ensconced by the soft, fluffy & warm pau....yum!However, their other signature dish Fried Hokkien noodles was unfamiliar to me. If this was inspired by the KL Style Hokkien noodles, this is a different animal altogether! The dish color was caramel not black. Pork lard was generously added so the dish was quite aromatic. The stock base was weak, not as full-bodied as the Malaysian version. Give this a miss or lower your expectations. We will be back to check out their DIY popiah though...

We were lured by the flaming chicken which was torched at your table before being cut. The fried oyster was not the typical style, instead a crispy version which is uncommon. This did not dampen our palate as we seemed to like it. Hokkien noodle was mediocre at best however the menu was large enough to accommodate a feast. Pretty new and they deserve some time to build a name
