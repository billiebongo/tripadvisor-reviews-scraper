Visited the Seoul Restaurant and had the Ginseng chicken soup. It was very tasty but the waiting time was almost 40mins. By the time my soup arrived, my friends have almost finished all their food. Pretty decent and authentic korean food in Singapore.

The owner managed to squeeze our party in last minute which we appreciated, its typical of a Korean BBQ, good service but more importantly a well priced wine list in a city that usually rips off the wine drinker, well done to the management!

if you like Korean food, this is a must.
If not sure how to order the excellent restaurant staff will help you, but get ready for a experince

Some of the reviews have not been so good mainly becos they were here for other korean dishes. The main point to visit this restaurant is to have their BBQ meat! Meat quality is superior as compared to other restaurants in Tanjong Pagar (u will probably spend more there) and this is a buffet! This is probably one of the most worthy korean BBQ restaurant in town (especially in a hotel)

Went for the dinner alacarte buffet and enjoyed the various cuts of pork, beef and chicken as well as seafood. Tried the stir fried rice cakes, fried pancakes and kimchi stew which were delicious. There was a selection of appetisers too. For the big eaters, $59.90++ is well worth the price. Some would even top up $20 to get premier cuts of meats and additional options. The Korean lady boss was rather hospitable in our opinion and a return visit seems likely

Had premium buffer dinner (S$89.90++) here after check out from Regent Hotel. It is tugged in 1 small corner at level 3 of Regent Hotel. Was welcomed by a Korean lady (presumably the boss?) with a smile. Staff is made up of both Korean and local origin. Variety - Pretty wide variety of meat for BBQ, including wagyu and dishes like ginseng chicken soup, chap chae, bibim guksu. However, the portion of these are of normal 1 person serving. Not favorable to your stomach especially you would like to try as many dishes as possible, unless you are with a big group. Side dishes - considerably limited (less than 10) as compared to in the Korean context (Jushinjung beats many in this aspect). It is self service to these side dishes, presented in our local (Singapore) buffet catering manner. Taste - wagyu beef is needless to say. Is well marinated and of above average to good grade. However, the ginseng chicken is a bit tad disappointing. It lacks of the "wow" factor, is mediocre despite it was stated as one of their signature. Service is generally fine. Staff are not rude but noted a small difference. Noticed that staff served side dishes to the table of a Korean family, whereas the rest had to help themselves to it. Probably they are VIP and hence the disparity?The good thing is, the exhaust system of the BBQ is good, you definitely will not leave the place irks of BBQ stench. I opine that it is generally an acceptable place to have Korean BBQ, however if you are after for authentic Korean dining experience, this place probably will fall short of your expectation. Last but not least, do make a reservation if you plan to dine on weekends. We were lucky to have a table without reservation because we were there just when they opened business for dinner (5.30pm).

Don't go there. Service was really bad. The thing is they was slangging off customers. I knew korean.They threw us off after served food before 10min. Food was too expensive than quality. Over priced. 가지 마세요. 가격도 너무 비싼데 좀 늦게 갔더니 제가 본중 가장 불친절한 한국인들입니다. 갑자기 주문 받고 10분뒤에 나가라고 해요.지금 고기 시키게 하고 니가라고 하는거냐고 했더니 "안나가도 돼는데 그럼 저희가 못쉬죠" 이러네요. 그전에 주문받을땐 2시반이 라스트오더라고 하더니 그말하니까 누가 그랬냐고 저한테 따져요. 그러더니 사장님이 2시반에 닫는다고 하더니 소리지르면서 나가라하고 문을 쾅쾅 닫아버리네요. 뒤에서 손님 흉도 보데요. 우리 예약하고 갔는데 그럼 예약은 왜받나요. 품질도 노베나에 있는 고기부폐가 낮습니다. 힌국인닌게 참싫어지는 하루였습니다. 料理は高すぎ。いくら海外でもない。不親切で注文させてから10分後追い払おうとした。社長はもう来なくていいからと。。。予約してその時間行ったのに私達が無理やり駆け込んだみたい。何よりまずい。二度といくまい

We arrived in Singapore and had a late night dinner at about 9:30. The food was average and the service was slow as it appeared the staff wanted to clean and go home.The second time was excellent for the lunch buffet just before we checked out of the hotel. The salad bar was exceptional with delicious kimchi and salads. Also the beef and pork we ordered was of high quality and well worth the price of the buffet given that it was a restaurant inside the hotel.I recommend this Korean restaurant especially for the lunch buffet. If you like Korean food it is very convenient if you stay at the Regent in Singapore

Came back to Seoul Restaurant today. Managed to get a booking on Friday night which is rare. Ordered the cold noodles (didn't really like it), ginseng chicken (good as usual), and BBQ marinated meat (we preferred it to be not marinated as it tasted too sweet). Staff were attentive despite it being very crowded. We got in 7pm, and were told next sitting was 8pm and we had to finish before that, but that was fine for us. Perhaps for 2 people we would recommend the Kim Chi tofu seafood soup, one ala carte meat BBQ, and rice, for an estimated $60. We obviously over ordered.

Went for lunch and the highlight of our entire meal was the Kimchi Jjigae which was so far the best we've had in SG and mirror those that we found in Korea. Steamed egg was well seasoned too as it wasn't too bland or too salty. Grilled meat was good but not spectacular. However, thought they give a good deal with all you can eat BBQ around 38SGD per adult during lunch time.One thing to note, vege for wrapping your grill meat is chargeable if you're not going for their buffet course which is the first to me and a minus point IMO

There first time for dinner, found food of good quality, service was good and staffs,attentive. We had buffet dinner the pork belly and marinated pork was very good.

Had a lunch buffet here- enjoyed the beef short ribs and thinly sliced beef brisket. Chicken and seafood options were minimal. Loved the squid although the mackerel was a little fishy. Didn't like the pork jowl steak- too "porky" in taste. Korean pancake made with Kim Chi and squid was more flavourful than the pancake with zucchini. Placed order for the acorn jelly three times but it didn't make it to our table somehow. Spicy bean curd stew with clams and egg yolk was a palatable and warm end to the hearty meaty meal. The cold spicy buckwheat noodle was tangy with some sweetness- really appetising. Wait staff could have been more attentive - the refill of tea was very slow. Th spread of cold dishes was decent. The best part is I didn't leave the restaurant smelling like a walking BBQ

I am a vegetarian and even then found the food great, Chapse, bean curd, etc were so wonderful. My guests from Korea said it is nearly authentic Korean food but the price is on a much higher side. The waiter were a bit unfriendly, we asked for a bit more sautéed onion but they said the kitchen is busy and it never came. And overall they did not make the experience the best but the food is certainly good

Having not visited Korea before, Korean food is not part of my usual or even occasional diet. We were invited to dinner at the Seoul Restaurant at the Regent Hotel and this proved to be both an educational and gastronomical experience.A narrow door leads to the Restaurant, that has very simple decor, a small main dining area in front of the bar, and several separate rooms able to accommodate 4, 6,12, and 24 dining guests. Tables and chairs are almost spartan, a few framed wall pictures, no curtains and a marbled floor. Yet, it’s in some ways still cosy. Lighting is bright. A TV monitor is in each room. WiFi from the Regent Hotel is available only if you’re a Hotel guest. Toilets are on your right down the corridor, as you exit from the restaurant. It’s wheel chair friendly.The service is prompt, attentive and polite. Waitresses know their dishes. Empty drink flasks are replaced regularly, and the atmosphere is neat and clean. The smoke from the grilling meat is sucked away through the double walled grill so that your hair and clothes don’t smell of smoke when you leave. They use stainless steel chopsticks, spoons, and bowls for rice.There’s a wide range of BBQ items to select - from beef, pork, chicken, sea food and sausages; and a good of selection of A La Carte dishes, the quality of which is impressive. I found the Sliced Pork Belly; the Boneless Beef Short Rib (wagyu grade quality) delicious and well marinated. The varieties of Kimchi prepared were refreshing with the crunchy, acidic flavors. The fruit selection for desert though was disappointing. The taste of the grilled meats is kept unadulterated by frequent changes of the stainless steel grill. The use of high quality wood for charcoal ensures that you get the best BBQ flavor. The raw food is well marinated and is tasty. The Restaurant promotes healthy and enjoyable food that attempts to maintain the authentic yet modern Korean cuisine, and at the same time reflecting the Korean culture and local taste. The experience was an eye-opener for me, and it’s certainly a place to return to for a tasty meaty meal. Good value for the buck, but note that there’s a $50/- fine if you leave uneaten food that’s over 100g.Address: 1 Cuscaden Road, The Regent Hotel, #03-02, Singapore 249715.Lunch: Mon-Fri : 11:30am to 2:30pm (Last order by 2pm). Sat, Sun and P.H : 11:30 to 3:00 pm ( Last order by 2:30 pm). Dinner: Mon-Sun : 5:30 pm to 11:00 pm (Last order by 10:00 pm) P.H : 5:30pm to 10:30pm (Last order by 10pm)

I must say that there is some disjoint between the overall look of this restaurant and the very fancy Regent Hotel where Seoul Restaurant is located. This restaurant is very simple in ambience, and in many ways very authentic looking. There is very little fanfare and decor is not the one of its priorities. The restaurant is divided into many many small rooms, which seat anything from 4 - 6 people. So if you have a large group, I think you may need to book early. We had the buffet dinner - and here is the verdict. Quality of the beef is very very good. We tried every beef and every pork dish they had on their buffet menu, and while everything was good, the beef in particular is outstanding. The boneless beef short ribs is the most superior of them all.We had some of the noodle dishes as well - authentic in taste but its probably not the reason you pay for the buffet. Still, they were of good quality and the range of food items on the buffet is pretty wide. This place uses charcoal for its grills and not gas grills which does add on a nice smoky flavour to their meats. One outstanding thing about this place is that the ventilation is fabulous and you do not leave the place with that very heavy smell of bbq. In fact, there is hardly any smell on us, which is very rare for a korean bbq restaurant. While the place is not very well decorated, the overall comfort level is still pretty high. Service was ok for us - the level of English was not at its best but definitely sufficient to get by. Most of the staff were smiley, and came very quickly once the bell was pressed.All in all, for the quality of meats presented, this is a place we would return to for Korean BBQ. Great food, authentic, and gets to the heart of what a good BBQ is about - high quality beef

Food rate 1/5Service rate 1/5The owner's attitudes are very rude and violent when the customer ask some changes. The food was not qualified to the expensive price and the name of the menu. I went so many restaurant in Singapore, the U.S. and other countries, but I can say this restaurant owner's service and food quality are terrible related to the price. I would not recommend any my friend

This is high-end Korean grilled restaurant that specialized in premium grade beef. We tried the a la carte buffet lunch. the menu was quite comprehensive with all the usual items like grilled meat, pancake, fish, noodles, soup, side dishes etc.. Premium grade meat are not included for the buffet but can be ordered by topping-up. Quality of the standard meat items were mixed. The beef ribs were good but the pork belly were dried and tough. All the cooked dishes and the side dishes were good. The restaurant used premium grade charcoal which did enhance the grilled meat flavor. It also installed built-in smoke removal grills that do away with those unsightly hanging vents. Ambient was simple but comfortable. Service needs improvement as staff appeared unmotivated and cold. Detail menu and price information are available at their website

Among the Korean restaurants in the area, this restaurant stands out for serving generally fresher portions and having staff who attends to your needs. The hotpot is suitable for even those who don't fancy too spicy stuff. Good for 2 to share. They have a promotion going now for 33 ala carte buffet, with option to add premium stuff for added cost. For those who are unhappy at poor service, it happens at every crowded Korean place.

The food here was sadly very average, and given the prices we were paying, I expected something better. The marinated beef and pork were way too sweet, and tasted more like char siew than anything. The kimchi was also too sour and lacked any proper flavour. In addition, we were not served any lettuce or garlic, which is customary for any Korean barbecue joint. What was even more disappointing, was the disastrous service. We were not served any water when we were seated, and it took a while to flag down a waiter to take down our order. The waiter's attitude was aloof and unfriendly, and it felt like we were bothering him by giving him our order. If this had been a neighbourhood restaurant, perhaps this would be less surprising, as many Korean restaurants are family owned and the servers lack proper training. However, being situated in a 5 star hotel, one would expect Seoul Restaurant to provide a minimum level of service. In addition, it is clear that the waiter treated customers differently. He was much more polite and attentive to Korean customers. Suffice to say, I'll never be back again. There are much better Korean bbq restaurants out there which are better value for money, and with friendlier service.
