The food never disappoint me. Visit for almost every week and all the noodles have that chinese wok taste which is so delicious. Plenty of cakes as well.

Very nice and cosy place! Tables are always full with families yet it is very easy to get a place to eat or drink tea!

Had lunch with friends today and the food just satisfactory. The fried rice not only oily but tasteless. The soup dry. The others just ok. Edible but for what we paid, we could have gotten better food.

Han's began in the late 1970s as a bakery and confectioners but quickly progressed to offer Hainanese dishes. I've a few happy memories of my parents bringing me there for a special meal of pork chops. Han's is still around today, and much of the menu items in Han's is also found in Hanis. However, the latter appears to be a slightly more upmarket version of its parent restaurant. And the old favourites, though perhaps not always as tasty as in other establishments, are often part of the daily set menu and are still what I usually go for. It also helps that the costs are often reasonable, at least by local standards. While the decor isn't grand at the Eastpoint outlet, it maximises space by using long tables and padded stools that allows for easy access and accommodation of larger groups

Thank you Hanis for good service and good food. My husband has multiple food allergies, and the staff always go an extra mile for him. We have brought friends along and they also liked it. The fried rice is delicious, and so are all the omelettes!

I"ve been here a few times in the last 3 months. The food is reasonably good. Somehow i feel they could be much better if they wanted to. The fast food dining concept tends to obscure their service and food standards. That aside i love the range of desserts & cakes they have there. Nice place to chill and have a coffee or hot beverage while getting some emails out on your mac or laptop.
