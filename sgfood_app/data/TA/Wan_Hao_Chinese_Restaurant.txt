Limited variety of dishes, food good overall though a little pricey, expected better service which was very average. Nice environment
5
Back here again to have lunch with my lovely friend... (cause we really like here and their staff Yumi, so we just gather back to here and look for her service
5
I cannot stress too much how exquisite the food here is! Every dish that came out was the most perfect thing I've ever tasted. My sister-in-law, a local, chose the menu and I don't know if it was just that she knew what order or if everything there is delicious, but I think that this restaurant probably has the best food I've ever had
5
The quality of food was impeccable, their staff were very friendly too! Although i wish that i had been informed that the menu was changed to the CNY menu
4
One of the classics amongst the Chinese restaurants in Singapore. Dim Sum were on point, with a different take on traditional Chinese food.
4
Delicious Food , good ambience and very courteous staff. Have visited this restaurant several times and always very satisfied. I have booked a table to have Chinese New Year reunion dinner with my family on 15 Feb 2018. Looking forward for a good time on that day
4
The food we had was good, but overall experience could have been better if service was better and quicker
5
A well-deserved fine dining Chinese restaurant under Marriott brand serves delicious food with beautiful presentation, services are warm and friendly, yet not pretentious. Special thanks to restaurant manager Ms Jenny Loh who has vast experience in hospitality experience and is able make dining experience at Wan Hao indeed pleasant. Look forward to going back soon
5
Had a lunch date with my dear friend and the food was excellent , the server (May) was attentive and help to refill tea, clear empty dishes and constantly check on us if the food was fine. She even helped us with picking the food choice . Overall the experience was great!
5
雖然錯過了中午的點心很可惜，但其他食物也非常美味，Eva與May的服務非常好，改天有機會會再回來的！Every dish is quite nice, and the service Eva and May provided is very good. Will come back to enjoy this amazing dinner
4
Food quality is good, worth the price but service so so. I was expecting it to be better with attentiveness and more smiles. Seemed the staff are pretty reluctant to work that day and its a Friday
5
The food was really tasty especially the iberico spain pork :p however without any vouchers it can get really costly
5
Me and my family having early celebration for Christmas at Wan Hao.My family love the food and specially the service that Miss Marilyn Khoo provide.She is a great staff that know how to take a good care of my mother.We sure will visit Wan Hao again.Thanks Miss Marilyn Kho
1
The current chef did not keep to standards.Previous chef cooking as fantastic and good!The current chef cooking was no match to the previous chef
3
We had dim sum which was acceptable in taste. But the roast duck was too pricey and a little too salty. Like that they served according to number of persons rather than the standard three or four in one order.Service was good.
5
Service is good. The spring chicken is nice :) they are also famous for thei dim sum which is worth a try
4
This is a good and casual dining place with family and friends. Great service too! Will visit the place again! :
4
One of the best Chinese restaurant around with good service and good food. Will go back again for sure.
4
During our recent visit, we ordered the shrimp-roll ($2.50/pc), Morel Dumpling ($2.30/pc), xiao-long-bao ($2.25/pc), abalone taro ($$5.50/pc), barbecue pork-puff ($2.25/pc), rice-roll (cheecheongfun) ($5), crispy-noodle ($24), coconut-pudding ($12), charsiew-bao ($2.25/pc), BBQ duck-chicken platter ($28). Chinese tea/person (refillable) was $5; total bill: $150.Despite the price for the items we ordered, the dimsum was exquisite and wonderfully tasteful; we all agreed that there much creativity and innovation in the items. Much value-added indeed! Service was impeccable also
5
The quality of the food definitely worth the price. Highly recommend the stir fried beef cube, which is very tender and tasty. The desert is great as well!
5
Staff friendly.. especially ms Jenny Loh and miss Yumi Low Higher recommended to my family and friends ..

I visited Wan Hao for the third time to celebrate my birthday with my family. We pre-ordered the Peking Duck for the second time for this special occasion and it was exactly what we expected ; Pure perfection. The food was impeccable and the staff were ever-friendly; always ready to serve with zeal. My uncle has visited the best restaurants in Beijing in search of the best Peking Duck. However, he mentioned that Wan Hao's Peking Duck was undoubtedly the best! We were more adventurous and tried other unique dishes from Wan Hao's menu and was very pleased even though the dishes seemed a little ambitious. Aside from all the positives, the only negative was that the portion of fish from the Grouper fish with XO sauce (a dish) was too little. Ultimately, I would definitely recommend anyone who wishes to have the best Chinese Restaurant experience to give Wan Hao a shot for I promise you will not be disappointed
5
The experience here is superb. From food to the crew; yummy food and nice ambience. Especially love the prawn with black truffles mayonnaise; the aroma from the truffle is heavenly and the prawn is fresh. The combination of beef and pear is unique.
4
We had a good dinner at this high-end restaurant. We chose the set menu with Boston Lobster with Singapore chilli sauce and angel's hair, sea coconut and conpoy in chicken soup, deep-fried soft-shelled crab with dragonfruit sauce and mango pudding dessert. The food was good and the portion just nice for me, a small eater but I think it may not be enough for a guy. I find the pot of chrysanthemum tea at $25 for the 5 of us too overly-priced
4
Had my favourite Steam chicken with Yunnam ham. Delicious and generously sized portion. Look forward to my next visit
4
The deep fried chicken retained it tenderness despite deep fried. A must try in this Restaurant. The scallop is fresh and large in green vegetables
5
Took 2 key clients to this restaurant. The service was world class, as was the upscale and thoughtful decor. The food was tasty and the Peking duck very enjoyable. Everyone left the dinner table happy and satisfied. Could not have gone any better. Highly recommend the place. (Would probably make a nice upscale date night as well).
4
Service was excellent despite the restaurant being full! I would return again! One of the best Peking duck ever.
5
A nice ad quiet place to dine with family. food are nice but a bit expensive. Value for money pay with the voucher
5
I visited Wan Hao for a family dinner. First impressions were very good. Staff were attentive and gave advice on what food to choose. They even offered scarves if it got too cold. The table we were given was in a smaller section. I think it was in one of their private rooms that they opened up for general patrons, so it was very quiet and exclusive.The dishes came promptly and all were delicious. The ones that stood out particularly were the roast duck and seaweed beancurd. I ate a lot of these two. The sweet and sour iberico pork also got a lot of good feedback from my family. I would come back here again for special family events
4
Food great! Make us want to experience more Wonderful location! Service wonderful! Visit again soon.
5
Had lunch on Monday and I was wowed by both the service and the quality of food.The bird's nest soup was tasty, and so were the dim sum basket items. Try the truffle dumplings
5
Food taste yummy & very polite staff here... remember her name is called Yumi Like her sweet smile  Like the dessert so much
4
Excellent food & environment for couples, friends or family. Service staff strength could do better because not many around with restaurant full at the time I was there for dinner
5
Excellent choice for dinner with friends in the center of Singapore. They have the freshest of seafood and variety of other meats if seafood is not your forte. The BBQ duck is juicy and tasty, almost passable for versions of such made famous in Hong Kong. The portions are generous. The service is excellent as well as the waiter and waitress attended to everyone of our needs. Tea promptly poured when they see that your cup is near empty. The place is roomy, not easily tellable from the outside, but they do have many smaller dining rooms for groups big and small. The dinner was so good that I went back the second night. Price wise, it is on the expensive side for Cantonese style food, but given that it's in the hotel, it is expected. Too bad I didn't have a chance to try the lunch Dim Sum, I heard that it is just as good, if not better
4
A Chinese fine-dining restaurant within Marriot Tang Plaza Hotel, Orchard. Therefore, a little bit pricey is expected. But, worth for a visit because they have good customer service, good ambience and satisfaction-guaranteed foods. Must try their flower tea which serving in a teapot.
5
The food was great,totally recommend their dim sum and peking duck! Not to mention the quality service as well! :
1
We booked for dinner, when we arrived no one greeted us for several minutes. Even though we booked for 4 people we were put on a table for 5 which was very big. We were only given one menu and had to ask for another. We were not offered a drink. Then when selecting food including dumplings we were told they don't serve dumplings at dinner. Feeling ignored we then just stood up and left and no one even came near us. Don't bother, an expensive restaurant like that should look after guests
4
Had a wonderful dinner again. Tucked away at a nice quiet corner of Marriott Hotel. Itâ€™s value for money with Amex Platinum privileges
3
We had visited this restaurant previously but this time around we were very disappointed. they charged top shelf but delivered a lot less
5
We went for lunch last Sunday with my daughter and husband, and we had a great meal. We order several Dim Sum as well as the duck. Overall very nice taste and reasonably priced for the quality
5
We are having lunch with my wife. All the food here was delicious . Especially dim sum was unique and value for money. Wan Ting is provide very good service and good knowledge recommend food for us. For sure will come back here to visit agai
3
The food is good, using fresh ingredients, but no special innovation and no particular refinement in the execution of traditional dishes. Pricey compared to many restaurants of the same calibre. No wonder we haven't been back here for years
4
If you are craving for Peking duck, you must visit here. It's a must try item in Wan Hao. And I also recommend Sichuan spicy soup. It recalled me my daddy's cooking when I was a little child. Thumbs up
5
I have a good day at Wan Hao restaurant. We have a birthday dinner at there. I like the service and food there. I specially wanna thank to Winnei,wWillian,Wan Ting,Yumi,Chun Xin and the chef. We have a great dinner there. Will be there agai
5
We have a wonderful lunch with my friends last week . We enjoy the Peking duck very much and the Tim shum as well .... thank you for the wonderful service from the service crew 
4
The beef was served with a sliced Chinese pear stewed in a blend of wines. Taking a slice of pear with each beef sliver that was stir-fried to just the right tenderness and done-ness created enhanced fusion of tastes. The broth with fish maw was nourishing although it'd have been better as a clear consomme instead of thickened with carrot
4
I had lunch at Wan Hao. The dim sums were excellent and the service was very good. The prices were OK for the qualit
3
the restaurant is quite well regarded but i found nothing exceptional. the food was ok, but service was slow and indifferent. it was especially disappointing as it was mostly the senior members of the staff who behaved like this. they never looked out for customer needs, and we had to wave several times for every request that we made ( e.g. asking for forks for our children ) For the price, there are better options out ther
3
It is just one of those weekend dinner, we chosen to go Wan Hao as we have not been there for quite a while, but the visit demolished the better impression I have had previously.We ordered few simple home style dishes, soup of the day, mixed roast, sliced garoupa and Kai Lan with garlic. Services from the servers were generally quite good and friendly, this is matching to a 5 stars hotel, but the let down is the kitchen.After we finished all the dishes except Kai Lan, we reminded the server twice, though they apologized repeatedly, but the dish didn't served until 15 minutes later, a big disruption for a meal, worst the Kai LAN was probably done in a rush, practically every stalk is coated with big volume of garlic, I have to poured some Chinese tea to wash it, before we can eat it..gave up to order any dessert.Some training or upgrading in the kitchen may be necessary to instill the discipline and skill.Was an disappointing evening at Wan Hai
4
Went there with family on last Sunday. The environment and food was very nice, however, the service did not meet our expectation. It took more than 10 minutes for the server to provide us menu, more than 30 minutes for the first dish to arrive. The restaurant was only half full on the day and the server didn't know about their soup of the day......Hope they can improve on their speed and give proper training
4
The small interior makes for a more intimate setting, great for dinner for two. Food is good and reasonably priced too
4
Tried the dim sum lunch and it was great! Variety and standard of the food is good. High quality dim sum
5
Dinner with wife for celebrated anniversary at Wan Hao Chinese restaurant,very delicious food specially the orange pork ribs and Peking duck,and the server, Wan Ting(heard she come from Taiwan),she was very friendly and full of passion of her job,even the restaurant is very busy she still provided us a excellent service,well done and keep it up..
5
Nice dim sum meal with great service by Judy.Quite ambience. WillDefinitely visit soon! 2 thumbs up
5
Went with my friends to celebrate her birthday, and a staff, Judy have excellent customer service, greeted us with warm smile, a funny lady

Wan Hao serves excellent food! You should try their fried rice and roasted chicken! Service is excellent here, their staff are attentive and responsive
5
I was with my friends during lunch time at Wan Hao restaurant, Chef Rovinng prepared the menu for me, Enjoyed the meal at the restaurant, food was above average would give it a 10 out of 10 because of the service providers by May, she made sure everything was going smoothly

and wow and wow, this was one of the most memorable lunches we ever had, many thanks! i am planning of coming back to Singapore only because of yo
5
The service level at this restaurant had always been consistent.Ms Winnie Yip, though pregnant, continues to provide excellent service. She is pleasant, helpful and has initiative, product knowledge too.However, the price of some fishes (i.e. sweet sour pork, cod fish) are slightly on tge high side compared to that of other fine dining resaurants.The dessert item like peach resin @ $18 per small bowl is definitely over-priced.Would like to reiterate again that the 10% service charge should be levied on the discounted amount. This matter neefs to look into immediately and ne in line with other restaurants.A S

This is the first time that I have my dinner with my wife at here to celebrate our anniversary. Both of us also like the environment and food, is so delicious. The staff was very cheerful and good service
4
Food was excellent...Price is high but be strategic - some credit cards have 50% off 2 pax dining..
5
Food was delicious & service impeccable! Cozy atmosphere too. We will return.Special Thanks to May for the attentive & warm service :
3
Food is pretty good, service is ok only. Service staff not much initiative and not attentive too. So overall experience ok onl
4
Food is nice a bit pricy and ambience and setting is very nice. The staffs are attentive though a bit short of staffs.
4
Had a great Dim sum experience previously and decided to give another go. Was not disappointed. Was really value for money if you utilise the Amex Platinum 50% voucher.
5
It's been quite a long time since I last reviewed this restaurant and I feel its time I updated it. Since the last review, all senior personnel at the restaurant have changed they now have a new chef helming the restaurant in Brian, a new manager in Jenny and all supervisors have changed with May being the only staff member still working there. I have continued to patronize this restaurant because I am a member of the Marriott club. I wanted to update the review because the standard of the food and the service has improved a lot since then. First the serving staff: Jenny the manager, May, Winnie and Marilyn the supervisors are all great people who treat their customers with care and consideration. Now the food: the sweet and sour pork which I raved about has got even better and is cooked with more consistent results than before. If you are a fan of sweet and sour pork as I am, you must try it. Over and above this dish I love their poached beef with Kailan. The Seafood or Fish Hor Fun ( flat rice noodles)with egg gravy is also very very good. They use a thinner version of Hor Fun almost like Ipoh Kway teow which is quite unique. The Orange pork ribs is also very good though a little on the fat side. There are also comfort dishes like the "beef fried with Kailan which Brian and his team do extremely well. If beef is not your thing then you can have the same dish fried with prawns which is also great. I forgot to mention that they also have a new Dimsum chef and her prawn dumplings(har Gao) is really good. I also like her spicy wan ton and Lotus leaf glutinous rice.Lots of choices all well done. Hope this review is helpful to you guys who read it
5
Staff were courteous and cheerful, taking the initiative to refill our cups once they are empty. Food were served promptly and delicious
5
Excellent and efficient service. Staffs were very friendly and helpful. Food was extremely delicious.
5
EXCELLENT SERVICE AND POLITE STAFF. 很好吃 Food were served promptly with observant and courteous staff, who attended to our needs with initiative and joy
5
They have excellent service! Food is exceptional as well! I would definitely recommend eating here and will be back again soon
2
Food was ok.. Service was disappointing. Everything seem to be in slow motion. A bowl of rice took 10 minutes. Bill took 15 minutes
5
I was there having with my relatives for my grandpa's birthday and was served by Marilyn. She was very helpful to our table and was very assisting. A good team player !
5
The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the bejing duck and the promotion wine was display on the table 
3
The service was unsatisfactory. Got our orders wrong for the soup and the wine. Rather hard to get the staff attention. Food was mediocre. Only saving grace was the soup and desserts. Considering the price I am paying, I would rather bring my business elsewhere. Simply not worth the price
5
It was a great experience in the restaurant. We were served by Marilyn and Wan Ting.It's a great thing that their service was excellent. We will go again to the restaurant
4
The decor of the restaurant is pleasant which contributed to the total experience otherwise marred by the extremely talkative staff. Food was good and ingredients used were fresh and of high quality. The cuisine is basically Cantonese but executed with a modern approach. I particularly enjoyed the steam marble goby in soya sauce and the stewed beef brisket.A small setback was the 'talkativeness" of the waiting staff but I may add that this is just a matter of personal preference. I am okay with the host coming by now and then to ensure that everything is alright but for a waiting staff to join in our conversation and make jokes is carrying things a little too far for me

Normally, I have 100% confidence whenever I spend money in hotel and which is why I have no worry at all to check all the items in the receipt. Unfortunately I only realised that the restaurant had actually overcharged me for an additional abalone when I check the receipt the next day morning. I called up Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel in the early morning around 815am on 8 Jul 2017 and informed the call centre agent to leave a message to Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant to check on my receipt for my ordering under my reservation on 7 Jul 2017 whether I really ordered the additional abalone or the restaurant has overcharged me. I understand they will be opening at 1130am on Saturday and I leave a message to call centre agent to get the restaurant to call me as soon as possible to find out this issue so that I can have an answer for such billing.However, to my surprise, they didn't call me. I have requested the call centre agent to give me the email of F & B director for me to raise my concern through email at 3:40pm. After sending the email to F&B director - Daniel Burstein around 5pm, a female staff from the restaurant called me to explain this was their mistake for overcharging me at 7pm. I'm surprised that I can only receive call from the restaurant after I have sent the email it to their F&B Director - Daniel Burstein and before that the no one from Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant even bother to call me to explain to me. I told the the female staff I know the bill was wrongly charged but why. She cannot answer me, so I informed her to get the manager to call me. Few more minutes later, this female staff called me again to explain that was a mistake and the restaurant can do a refund. I told her that I understand it was an overcharge for 1 abalone. But I need her to get the restaurant manager or management to explain to me how can this thing happen in Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza - Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant. There is no such thing that they can simply tell you they wrongly overcharge me and then tell me that they can do a refund to close this case. The problem here is, if I didn't even check again my receipt I won't know there is an additional abalone charged to my bills. So, if this is a standard of service for Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel to handle this kind of sensitive issue? I did check with a friend who also a regular guest in this restaurant, he told me that it is a must to check the receipts whenever dining in Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant as there is always an issue of accuracy or overcharged. If such issues keep happening in the restaurant, there is no one from management looks into how to improve the standard of services, this is really making me shocked. Even I have raised the concern on my receipts in the morning, there is no immediate actions taken by the restaurant manager to call me and explain as well as apologise to me as if this is a small issue and refund can settle this issue easily. I asked the restaurant manager Ms. Jenny Loh, what is the main reason for having such mistake in the restaurant especially this is related to money. She told me the staff who has overcharged me and has done the mistakes again. Yes, human makes mistake, but who is the in charge of this restaurant, who is the in charge of this hotel to allow this kind of mistakes keep happening in this restaurant. Ms. Jenny Loh offered to refund but she has to get my credit card info through phone to refund this overcharge. I ask her if this kind of issue happens on her, is she going to provide credit card info to the restaurant through phone ? She kept silent. She offered again to refund me but I need to go down restaurant to get the refund. I told her that the mistake was from the restaurant, why should I waste my time to go down the restaurant to get such refund. Then she finally offered to come to my place to do the refund. So, this is the trick, they don't know what is bespoke service supposed to be provided to the guest. They try their luck, if you can provide credit card info through phone, this is the best solution. If this is not feasible, they will ask u go down, if you don't bother to go down the restaurant to get refund then they will come to your place to do the refund to close this case. Is there anyone from this restaurant or this hotel know what does the customer service mean to the hotel?Till now, no one from the management calls me for a great explanation and great solution. I'm very disappointed that Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza has such management team to take care this Wan Hao Chinese restaurant.

Let's be clear, we only went there with the purpose of eating a pecking duck as it was mentioned as one of the 5 best Peking duck in Singapore by Taylor magazine, and they are generally reliable. And, how well the delivered! Delicious little bird, they prepared the crepes for us and then served the meat with a fried rice which was also delicious. We did not eat anything else, so cannot comment on the rest of the menu.The service was very good, our server was friendly and actually funny. The location inside the Marriott is so-so, no windows, very traditional Chinese setting. But I would be back for the duck anytime
4
My hubby and I didn't have good experience in the past. They have since stepped up on service quality hence I have been quite a regular. Dessert must try the almond milk with glutinous rice balls. For dim sum is of good quality although I think the prawns in the har gow are usually over cooked and could do with addition of chopped bamboo shoots bits or celery bits for texture. The abalone yam balls are a delight to have but I would suggest removing the pork slices and leek which and use chopped turnip vegetables to balance the heavy taste similar to conrad golden peony
5
Excellent food and service especially May from wan hao restaurant. Very friendly and great in product knowledge.
4
I have come to expect consistently good Dim Sum from Wan Hao. The prawn dumpling and roast pork were among my favourites. With the Amex Platinum $50 voucher it was simply value for mone
4
Fine Chinese dining. Food is cooked impeccably and delicious. Service is slow and often need to ask a few times for it.
5
Few days ago when to singapore shopping. Friend's recommend this chinese restaurant. Wah, it was great and the service was super great. Ask for Jenny, but she is on leave, another help me in the order, her name Marilyn, she was great. We will be back to the restaurant when visit singapore again
5
Such a nice birthday dinner at the fine dining chinese restaurant of This Marriot hotel in Orchard Road. The taste and presentation of the foods were amazing. The staffs were very knowledgable and helpful. They have vegetarian a la carte menu and even vegetarian set menus. Awesome! It is very easy for me and my partner to choose for our special dinner. I did not take much of the picture of the foods as we ate it directly, no time for picture as it smelled sooo good. Thank you for the enjoyable dinner and we definitely will come back next time
5
Tasty food served in rather generous portion in a refined and classy ambience . Service staff were friendly and cheerful especially Ms Wanling with her very wholesome smile and pleasing mannerism .A great place to have intimate dining as well as celebrating special occasions 
5
Excellent Service - The servers know how to keep their distance while ensuring our needs are met. They are really friendly too.Comfortable atmosphere - Seats are generally not that close to one another. Minimal noises from guests.Generous serving of food - Main dish serves 3-4 imo.

ACCOR buys Fairmont… →Winsome WThe intrepid and audacious Travelling Gourmet TM goes to the crossroads of Orchard Road to the marvellous…MARRIOTT…where the discerning connoisseur of Chinese ‘haute cuisine’ can discover and savour really ‘superbe’ Cantonese specialities that will blow your mind! After an expensive makeover which saw the intimate and cosy booth seats at the four corners of the restaurant enlarged and refurbished to look like giant ‘jewel boxes”, the new Wan Hao exudes style and timeless elegance reminiscent of  ‘art deco’ chic. Ninja black colours contrast with gold nuances…a far cry from the old style auspicious red décor of old school Chinese restaurants. It is a mix of ZEN and Austin Powers’ International Man of Mystery swinging sixties interior design!Chef Bryan Wong is creative and open to new concepts in food and cuisine, partly due to his former post at UNILEVER creating new recipes. Youthful and friendly, he explained, “We present the Cantonese dishes in a new way and enhance the natural flavours without using artificial ingredients! ,,My personal motto is “Das Leben es ist unbestimmt, isst erst den Nachtisch!” and so I shall tell you fist about Chef’s Dessert which has no added sugar and uses all natural flavours of the Coconut to combine with an ‘avant garde’ Pulut Hitam Nyonya Dessert. paired with sexy Coconut Ice Cream. A true Winner which I loved! Yes, nowadays, diners do not want too overly sweet desserts because they are very health conscious. This classic Asian/Nyonya Dessert presented in an avant garde way is most pleasing and attractive to the eyes and Heavenly on the palate! YUMMIE!Delicious Dim Sum!These little morsels not only give you automatic “portion control”, they also touch the heart…which is what Dim Sum means in the Cantonese language. I adore the one with the cute little Abalone on top!Piece de resistance!Of course the all time signatures are the Peking Duck carved at tableside and the crispy Roast Chicken with big crunchy Julienne of deep fried Fish Sticks. The LEAN ueber-crispy wafer-thin Peking Duck skin is wrapped in pancakes with savoury-sweet Hoi Sin Sauce, Cucumber Batons and aromatic Spring Onions for a taste sensation to blow your mind! OMG Yummie! It is to parachute behind enemy lines in Syria to terminate ISIS terrorists for! I never say “to die for” BECAUSE when you are dead you cannot eat or taste anything n’est pas! Dr. Michael Lim is a celebrated Travel, Food & Wine Writer/Editor/International Wine Judge. Luscious Lobster is irresistible.J’adore Wan Hao! The staff like Manager Jenny and May are so helpful and very nice! Guten Appetit! ENJOY! A Peking Duck in the hand is worth 10 wild ducks in the wild! I know because I have hunted wild ducks before as well as wild boar…but that is another story :-

Prompt and responsive service. Cosy place to have dim sum and conversation with families. The deep fried mango roll, glutinous rice are such a delight to enjoy. Overall very good food quality and presentation.
3
The food is good but portions are rather small hence price is abit on the high side especially if you do not have any card discount or special offer vouchers. Service can be sometimes slow otherwise it is courteous
5
Visited on 3 June 2017, lunch. Outstanding and excellent service staff with delicious food. Top notch ambience and central location
5
My wife (Rita) and I have been patronising Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant for dim sum lunch and Chinese tea. Recently, we started eating vegetarian food like Double Boiled Monkey Head Muchroom Chinese Herbs, Assorted Muchroom Seasonal Greens and Braised Vegatarian Chicken Bean curd, Xiang Chun Sauce. We recommend Chef Brian Wong's Braised Bird Nest, Crab Meat with Superior Stock Beansprouts or Steamed Egg White, Bird Nest Superior Stock and Crab Meat.When you think of authentic Cantonese food and dumpings festival (till 4th June) go to Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant at 3rd floor, JW Marriott Hotel. Make sure you call 65 6735 5800 to make a reservation.
5
I always enjoy dinner in this restaurant! Very good seveise and lovely team. The food here also very nice we like it very much
4
Restaurant is located in a corner on 3rd floor of Marriott Tangs Hotel. A very warm and cosy ambience, great for a meal on a special occasion!
5
My 2nd time to this restaurant, and both the food and the service is outstanding. Dim Sum is limited to lunchtime. Well worth a visi
5
I don't normally write reviews out of my own volition, but for Wan Hao i simply have to make an exception! The item i'm focusing on might sound like plain fare to those who visit the likes of Marriott but really, Wan Hao's seafood fried rice completely and overwhelmingly trashes its competitors in all departments. Some say that you can tell the skill of a chef by tasting his/her omelette. I believe the same case can be made of the humble fried rice in the chinese context.It sounds odd, but the rice itself was so springy yet soft, ridiculously fluffy yet firm. It's so good, even a paleo crack addict would have a go at it. It tastes so healthy, is so moist yet is without a trace of oil. The fragrance and flavour is subtle, unlike other interpretations which focus on delivering a formulaic overdose of taste. It makes for a perfect fit with the scallops, prawns, crab and traces of fish - all of which taste like they were hoisted straight out of the ocean. This is why this dish is so much better than its contemporaries. It's the taste of something pure at its very heart, a dedication to perfection in the fundamentals, and a rejection of taking the easy way out (something i'm guilty of)And i got to sit at a cosy wall-inset sofa table. Anyone would be happy. There are so many other dishes i've yet to try, but I'll definitely be back. Good job Wan Hao, i can't even help but spout so much nonsense hahah
4
Limited selection of Dim Sum but is of high quality Main course varieties is of market standard.The roast chicken is highly recommended as the meat is tender and juicy. One that is normally not found in other restaurants.Service standards is acceptable despite of 3 to 4 staffs at workAmbient is acceptable for market standard
3
The Restaurant is cosy. Location is very good. Food price is reasonable if you are a Farecard member. Food is of good quality

I've been to Wan Hao a couple of times in 2015 to early 2016, and I remember thinking that Wan Hao serves pretty decent food but was slightly overrated for its price-point.Hearing about the hype of the new and improved Wan Hao with Chef Brian at helm, I decided to host my friends there for a group dinner.Lo and behold, My friends and I were completely blown away by the quality of the food and service. I was so pleasantly surprised by the vast improvement in food quality that my surprise became the highlight of my dinner (imagine that!).I ordered 7 dishes and they were a hit within the group. Oh, such pride and joy I felt for being THE ONE to host them at such a spectacular restaurant. And I have Wan Hao to thank for that glory.Of course, the hospitality shown by the lovely waitresses supplemented our experience greatly - with special mentions to May and Gigi (I think that was her name).I must say that I can't wait to be back at Wan Hao again.Food recommendations:- Pork ribs with mandarin orange- Deep fried pumpkin prawns- Seaweed beancurd with spinach and mushroom- Wan Hao signature crispy chicken- Coconut desser
5
Special Thanks to May for her prompt response and attentive service. The food was fabulous.May 's recommendation of the deep fried Prawn with truffle sauce and broccoli, Peking duck, roasted pork belly and the green apple with pork soup were very good. We liked the ambience and the service met with our expectations
3
Not too bad. No MSG. Need more variety. .. list a bit little. They need to create new dishes to continue attracting customer
5
Being a faithful customer of Wan Hao, I can always rely on the hospitable service crews Marilyn and May to recommend their popular and promotional dishes
5
You'll have your pick of Chinese restaurants in Singapore, and this is one of the best. A lovely dining experience and excellent food. The sweet and sour pork is one of my favourites
5
Great food n ambient .. Prive reasonable service is great. Must visit for the nice Sim sum. Steam as per order
5
Peking duck is delicious! I like to come here to lunch with my friends..Your staff, May is very friendly and i would like to see her whenever i come here
5
This ranks as one of my favorite restaurants in SG. Simply because of the quality of food,excellent service. staffs with good knowledge about food and attentive to our needs.The hostess Summer is friendly and efficient. Many thanks to Wan Hao for providing such a wonderful dinning experience
4
good chinese food - dim sum...nice quiet restaurant for dining in...food quality was above average but i have tasted better..
5
I would recommend this restaurant as both their food and service both very good. Our waitress, Marilyn is friendly and very helpful. My family and I were very pleased with our visit to Wan Hao, and we will be back again soon
5
Had dined a few times in March and April 2017 at Wan Hao. Dining experience had always been very satisfying. Ms Jenny Loh and her assistants Ms Winnie Yip together with Marilyn and the whole team always give their best attention and served with a smile.The taste of the food had since improved, and the freshness and quality maintained.The only setback is the computation of the service charge. The amount charged should be based on the discounted sum. A.S
5
Dined a number of times in Wan Hao last month. As usual, the service provided by Ms.Jenny Loh and her lieutenant, Winnie Yip as well as other staff like Marilyn, and all the other team members were always excellent. They made our dining experience a bliss by giving their best personal attention and being accommodative.The consistency of the dishes cooked has improved. Keep up the good work, chefs.As mentioned before, the service charge computed should be based on discounted amount as practiced by other restaurants. Please do give this matter your immediate attention
3
Food was great. But I had asked for a quiet table and was given one in the middle of the room. Hey ho
5
Their peking duck is one of the best i've eaten! skin is extremely crispy and meat cooked with fried rice is great! I never get sick of the food here! Love coming back here because the service is extremely good too! Not a large restaurant so you can enjoy your dinner without a noisy background!
4
All of the food was good but the peking duck was the standout.The deep fried tofu and truffle flavoured seafood were also excellent.extensive wine list and some of the bottles quite reasonably priced.May our waitress was so friendly and helpful. the whole team were lovely. A very enjoyable experience.We want to return for dim sum at lunch
5
Food is excellent... love the ambience and stylish fusion design. Cosy and semi-private jewel box concept . Superb award winning Peking duck. Attentive service staff especially May, who has display warmth and TOP notch hospitality service. Definitely be back for Dim Sum ! 100percent recommended to return! :
5
Excited to be here to try out the "Love Dinning Celebrity Edition"-Menu attached FYI. The food on the set menu is fantastic, particularly the bird nest dumpling and the baked cod fish. I was served by the waitress, named May. She is so attentive, friendly and polite. Thanks to Wan Hao Restaurant for providing us such a wonderful dinning experience with excellent customer service and fantastic food. Well done and look forward to be next time to perhaps try the peking duck. It looks so good
5
Good recommendation by service staff at Wao Hao - the quality and freshness deserve a accompanied by good service completed a great dinning experience
5
Wait staff were very attentive Food was excellent Ambience was perfect I will definitely patronize the restaurant again.
4
I always prefer not to order the usual traditional dim sum if possible. And in this restaurant, I managed to order almost every dim sum unique to the restaurant. They were very creatively crafted and simply delicious. All my guests were delighted not only with the food but the level of service which was very attentive and the ambience was comfortable and the well laid out seating allowed a certain level of privacy. In all a very good experience
5
The food was great and we had hot and sour soup which was amazing and the main courses were excellent. May is very good.. very approachable and friendly.. her service and warm smile completed our dinner on a high.
5
Peking duck is awesome!Excellent service!!Ambience is good..Staff with good knowledge about food.Dessert is awesom
5
One of our Favourite Chinese restaurant in singapore ! Love the ambience, service as well as the quality of food. Will be back again soon!
5
Just want to thank all the chef provide us the super delicious food and if i not wrong i think is Wan Theng and May Tan give us the service their very friendly and service very good Excellent.... is just a normal dinner it really enjoyed... oops peking duck must try super super nice
5
I went with a family today as it was conveniently close to my house. The foods is delicious. It was nice that we must come for more.The services from waitress was the main reason why I write this review for the restaurant. She was very helpful, knows the menu, attentive to our needs and with a beautiful smile all the time that kept us feel welcomed. Her name is Marilyn Khoo.They have definitely won us as regular customers
5
Good service by may and want ting ! She is such a lovely and nice person. Glad to be surf by them ! Food are so delicious , environment are so peaceful and nice . Definitely will come at next visit :)
5
Comfort food meets culinary sophistication. Our dishes appeared carefully prepared while retaining that familiar ç…®ç‚’ taste. Beef was tender while each individual grain of rice held its gloss. Our waitress, May, was friendly and attentive. We will be back.
5
My family and I always visited Wan Hao for our special moments of gathering. And I must say the standard of food have always maintain at its best and never less. The service and the staff were one of the main factors that we are "loyal" to them. Haha... the Peking Duck was really good and crispy as always. What I like about it, it is never too strong in the game taste. We had the second part of the duck as it is. And it is still as good! We did order a few other dishes, but it was fabulous as usual. A matter that I must address are their desserts! My gosh! It is really pretty on presentation and so are the taste. My aunt from America who is very particular about her desserts, actually had so much to say about it. She was in love with it. My other elders enjoyed it too as it was not too sweet for their liking. We had the coconut pudding and purple glutinous rice, deep fried durian and my all time favorites, red bean pancake. It really worth the bite no matter how full you are. However, kudos to the service team, they really make an effort to ensure we enjoyed our night. Thank you Winnie, Gigi and May so much for taking care of my family.
5
I think they have just revamped their menu. Price has gone a little steeper at almost $4 for 2 pcs of dimsum dish. Nonetheless, quality was still worth it and I am very pleased. Main dishes such as their prawns and vegetables were still as innovative and yummy. My favourite prawn dish would be the truffle one and the one with egg white and foie gras. A good place to indulge for an afternoon tea :)
5
I regularly frequent here for family meals and this restaurant never disappoints. It serves awesome Chinese cuisine and offers top notch service. Would highly recommend anyone wishing to have a quiet and comfortable dining experience
5
Ordered the dim sum here was nice especially black truffle prawn dumpling, mango prawn crispy rice roll and also taro dumpling with abalone. Services staff was always smilling and polite. A very good experience. Add thid to the best dining restaurant and it adds up to perfection
5
We had dinner here last Tuesday.The restaurant was exceptional,not only because every meal we enjoyed had a variety of options and was flavorful but also because the prices were so reasonable!The beef with black garlic was unique,much try the Beijing duck skin was crispy..... .We definitely are back!Highly recommended
5
I had a wonderful dinner with my husband. The food was delicious and served by friendly staff: May and Wan Ting. Definitely will come back again.
5
Many thanks to Wan Hao for the wonderful dinner experience and we had an amazing time. The food at Wan Hao is absolutely spectacular and the waiters/waitresses were just professional, especially Asst Manager Winne Yip who is very personable and very efficient. Looking forward to dine in Wan Hao again in future. What a great restaurant
5
Top class service from staff Wennie and May. Service with smile. Excellent food. Perfect pear beef. Peking duck is the best in town. Unique fusion food. Really enjoy the food and service. Never regret dining here. Always highly recommended to friends and colleagues. Cannot wait for next visit. Looks forward to next visit in two weeks' time. Good opening hours with good location. Covenient and easily accessible..................................

Beijing duck is number 1 at Singapore.beef.n pear unique.service excellent without peers.really enjoin the food n services especially winnie n may.always with a smile and prompt services.Have come to wanhao for the the 5 years.for the excelkent food and services.kche

Haven't been here before and wish I had. Food was excellent such as truffle mayonnaise prawns or crab and egg white. We are a large group and they gave us a private room as the restaurant was relatively quiet. The place is so convenient - right at the heart of Orchard Road. Prices were not cheap though
4
What I like about this restaurant is the service rendered to the diners. The restaurant manager, Ms Jenny Loh leads by example, thus all the other staff like Winnie, Marilyn, May, William, Marvis, Kristine and all the subordinates provide the highest standard of service that make dinning a blissful one.Secondly, the ingredients used for the food are of rather good quality. As for the cooking, it varies at times, thus the taste is inconsistent. The executive chef needs to look into this matter seriously to keep up the image of a fine dining restaurant.A.S
3
Held a family gathering at Wan Hao on a weekend... 2nd time trying their dim sum and have to say that the quality was decent and much better than 6 months ago... I won't say their dum sum is in the same league as Hua Ting but definitely comparable to Imperial and Crystal Jade... but the price is fairly steep consider per piece of item is $2 to $4 depending on what you order. Will go there again as I have AMEX Palate Card offer.
4
Always looking forward to having either lunch or dinner at Wan Hao. Service-wise, it has been consistently pleasant as rendered by the Manager, Jenny Loh and her assistants comprising Winnie, May, Marilyn,Mavis, Christine as well as the junior members of the team.However, while in terms of food freshness, quality and ingredients used, there is no complaint, the method of cooking and final taste at times appear to be different. Hope that this can be looked into. The management should also look into :- 1. the pricing of the dessert items. 2. the 10% service charge i.e. if there is a discount, must base on discounted amount. Eng Eleano

我去新加坡找朋友當我們煩惱要吃什麼時，我朋友向我推薦了這間餐廳！我們點了半隻北京鴨，肉質鮮嫩好吃重點是服務員非常的有禮貌像是May Kristin Marilyn Winnie Mavis 他們都是非常專業的服務
5
Good for diners looking to having a sumptuous meal with nice ambience! Restaurant plays relaxing Chinese classical music as their background music. Love the booth seats that the restaurant offers, which provides diners with a private space. The booth seats can sit up to 4 pax. Do call their hotline to reserve the booth seats as there are only 4 booth seats in the restaurant. Highly recommend

We knew we were into a good thing last night when every dish we ordered from the a la carte menu turned out tasty and well presented. Some Chinese restaurants fall off the mark over Chinese New Year but not this one.Some of our favourites from last night:1. chicken bak kwa yu sheng - no fish in this one but the thin slices of Bak Kwa (bbq chicken jerky) and deep fried fish skin were a nice touch to this dish. We wish this was on the regular menu.2. Kurobuto pork char siew - thinly sliced, tender and with a lovely flavour 3. home made tofu with spinach - a classic Cantonese dish that's well executed and delicious. They don't smother the tofu in gloopy sauce here so you can appreciate the crispy skin of the freshly deep fried egg tofu. The braised spinach was tasty and complimented the tofu nicely.4. Glutinous rice cooked with Chinese sausage in a lotus leaf - lots of thinly sliced Chinese sausage lend a sweet touch and lovely fragrance to this dish. 5. thinly sliced Nian kao with yam paste - this was deep fried like the traditional Szechuan red bean pancake. You can about 10 slices per order so this should definitely be shared. The single serving dessert dish of warm almond cream with tang yuan was of high quality - very smooth and not artificial tasting. This one is on the regular menu.Service was a little harried but sufficiently attentive. We wish the dining room was bigger as the tables were a little close together (people kept bumping into there back of my chair) - quite a large part of the floor area is devoted to private rooms (which are spacious).
4
This is one of the nice place for a dim sum lunch. Good quality and affordable prices. Ambience did also good
4
Yusheng was well-balanced amidst the sauce-drenching ritual while kingly Buddha Jumping Over the Wall is lauded for its unreserved originality. Just that the Roast duck needed a stronger torching but crispy chicken and marmite scallop are close cousins of 1st runner-ups. Had fun time, thks
5
One of the best dim sum we've had! Service was immaculate too. Great ambience, tables nicely spaced out so it feels pretty private.
5
Went for the weekday lunch. One of the best dim sum. Har gow - serving for the prawns were generous and freshChar siew polo bun - one of the best around Xiao long bao - quite normalPrawns and scallops rice rolls - portion is enough for one personDown-side of all is the price. 116sgd fr 4pax.
4
Food and service quality is excellent. Authentic Cantonese cuisine. The price on the high side. But there are some value for money items on the menu
4
Recently the restaurant had gone upgrading and reopening with a new menu. The 4 of us were showed to a booth table which was quite cosy with cushions around. Little Jj quite enjoyed himself with free wifi to watch his cartoons. We started off with chrysanthemum tea ($5++/ pax).Steamed Shrimp Dumpling, Black Truffle, Cordyceps Flower 黑菌虫草花鲜虾饺 ($6++/2pieces)It smelt and tasted quite nice of the black truffle.Steamed Pork Siew Mai 干蒸烧卖 ($4++/ 2 pieces)Meaty and juicySteamed Chicken Claw, Black Bean Sauce 豉汁蒸凤爪 ($4++/ 2 pieces)It took awhile to be served as the order was left out the first time. The serving was bigger than expected. Quite tender and flavourful.Steamed Glutinous Rice, Dried Shrimp, Chicken Mushroom 虾米荷香糯米鸡 ($5++)Slightly oily, there was salted egg yolk in it too.Steamed Salted Egg Custard Bun 黄金流沙包 ($4++/ 2pieces)Served pipping hot, it flowed out smooth rich lava filling.Scallop Rice Noodle Roll 带子精选肠粉 ($5++)Felt that the roll stick to each other easily.Deep-Fried Taro Dumpling, Mini Abalone, Scallop 精制鲍鱼炸芋角 ($10.50++/ 2 pieces)I was surprised by the chunk of scallop inside the dumpling. It was like a scallop covered in rather thin crust.Pan-Fried Radish Cake, Preserved Meat 香煎腊味萝卜榚 ($4++/ 2 pieces)It was too soft for my like. Did not really taste the radish in it.Baked Egg Tart 港式酥皮蛋挞 ($4++/ 2 pieces)Super small in size. Gone in a mouthful, but it simply melted in the mouth.Soup of the Day 时日例汤 ($14++)It was full bodied with very tender pork rib.Double-Boiled Peach Resin, Red Date 红莲桃脂（热） ($16++/ hot)Clear sweet soup with jelly like block in it.Deep-Fried Crispy Durian 酥炸黄金果 ($16++/ 4pieces)It was very rich and creamy durian pasted encased in thin crispy crust. A tab oily.Almond Cream, Purple Glutinous Rice Puree 杏仁茶芝麻汤圆 ($12++)The paste was smooth and creamy without any powdery texture.Over food was not bad. I was surprised that the place was packed even it was a weekday lunch time
5
This restaurant is definitely one of my favourites in Singapore. It offers a wide range of Chinese dishes at very reasonable prices. The ambience and service are quite nice. It is definitely the place to go for Peking duck in Singapore.
4
We enjoyed the Chinese food a lot but was quite disappointed with the Peking duck. However, unlike other place we went, not so many others ordered Peking duck. Clearly, this is not just a place for it!
4
看了網上介紹，萬豪軒北京烤鴨出名，特別去嚐一下，結果挺失望的，但是其他菜色確時很滿意，烤豬件、上湯系列的青菜都很到位！推薦，但是別點北京烤鴨！
The Peking Duck is not worth money but the rest of dishes are pretty awesome! Highly recommend restaurant but not for Peking duck!
5
It was an intimate family event. However, I was impressed by the attention and service provided by the staff during the 2hr dinner we had. It was a pleasant evening. The food was delicious. Definitely deserve 2 thumbs up!
4
One of my favourite Chinese restaurant in town. It is a typical but good up-market Chinese hotel restaurant Good service, tasty consistent food, nice ambience and reasonable pricing. What we really love about the exquisite Cantonese delights in Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant is the usage of fresh, premium ingredients. The food is Cantonese and therefore fairly bland but tasty and well presented. It is not cheap and wine prices are quite over the top. The food is good, especially the deep- fried prawns with black truffle and broccoli, wok- fried Iberico pork with home-style spiced sauce, and wok-fried local lobster with dep-fried garlic in spicy Hong Kong style were exquisite. Lastly, thumbs up to the service Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night. I would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon
4
1st time at this restaurant at invitation of friends for lunch. Chose Executive Set lunch. Abt S$70 per set seems reasonable for 5 courses. Portions adequate for a good lunch w/o the overeating feeling. Attentive but non-intrusive service so conversations uninterrupted. Not a large restaurant so reservations recommended. Restaurant on 3rd floor of Marriott Hotel so convenient access by public transport- mrt & bus
3
I prefer the old dÃ©cor. Food is similar. However I have the feeling that some items have now come with a small price increase. Still OK if you like a calm hotel Chinese food experience. Quality of prawns seem to be the large and beautiful but not so tasty variety
3
The food was great, but can't say the same for the service. Firstly they crowded all their guests in one corner. The rest of the restaurant was empty. I guess it was easier for the service staff to handle. The result was that it was noisy for us and we were practically sitting back to back with each other. Service was poor despite this. No one was around when we needed more tea and when we were able to get someone's attention, he had to squeeze through the guest chairs to reach us. What was worse was that he took our tea pot away and forgot to return it to us
3
Not one of those I would look to going back but was there for dinner upon an invitation. Food, staff and decor of the place is good and befitting a known hotel in a prime location of Singapore.1 or 2 dishes stands out. Most of the service staff are great, but all these are let down by a female waitress with short hair cut who was not just impatient, but rude with no apparent reasons.She has no hesitation letting us know that she simply could not be bothered. This is a F&B industry, in a hotel in the Orchard area. All the good work by many, taken away by one ugly attitude
1
Went there at 710pm. Clearly stated we needed the food fast. Reminded then three times, having to get up from my table as nobody came to serve us. Ordered 4 dishes. 1 came at 745. By 755 I was done. All I got was a sorry about that. Three wait staff for the whole place, guess there was only one cook in the kitchen.. Never again. Patheti
5
Went for lunch and had an excellent meal. All items were well prepared. Especially liked the shrimp dim sum with truffle. Even the vegetables we ordered were cooked perfectly.
4
Food is delicious and tasty. I will patronise and recommend to friends, families, colleagues and relatives.
4
Very good restaurant, good food and great service unlike the marriot hotel, the new comers are liars.
Hairy crabs in season !!!!
5
Had dinner here with my friends and the food was awesome!! Staff here is friendly and helpful to us. Desserts is refreshing, totally love fried durian. 👍👍👍
3
This is a typical up-market Chinese restaurant in a major hotel in Singapore with good food but quite expensive. The service was good but there are many places around very similar.
5
The peking duck is delicious. Service was excellent and dishes were served pretty fast. I had a wonderful dinner experience.
5
I was served by Ms Winnie Yip and her service is amazing. As its my first time dining at a 5 star restaurant, she aid me in my orders and provide me with reasonable recommendation suited to my liking. Her hospitality is certainly commendable.
2
Took a client for lunch on October 31 and spent over S$500/- having 2 Hairy Crab Menu B sets plus an additional hairy crab each. (TBL 42/1 CHK 6443). Crabs were "over steamed" and one of them wasn't even fresh! This is the worst hairy crab meal I've had in 20 years! Avoid at all costs, and definitely my last visit
1
First time at wan hao few years ago not pleasant as staff gave the booth seat to a walk in but compensated with good service standards. Decided to give another try after Reno. No one at reception and wait was more than five minutes. Day before two staff called to confirmed reservation reflecting poor coordination. Service staff obviously not well trained and great at ignoring disappearing act. Bill took more than fifteen minutes to come only after I tried reminding waving and raising my voice a few times including being ignored by the restaurant manager busy chit chatting with staff and deliberately ignoring. The asst mgr tried to appease but no apologies rendered. They should learn from ritz Carlton and many other mid range Chinese restaurants which I find service standards more acceptable than this. No hot towels. Egg tarts was re heated twice overcooked with very hard orange skin. Rest of dim sum good but gotta live with sucky service standards worse than coffee shop drink server

Couldn't resist ordering olive fried rice again. And their monthly special, fried pumpkin cake, it gets tastier with each bite. Tried a new dessert today, malaikou! Soft and spongy cake with red bean. It's so well balanced! Not too sweet but flavorful!
5
Thanks to Trip Adviser we tried this Restaurant, the food, wine list, service and ambience was excellent. It was that good we went back again 2 nights later.
4
Good dim sum , the food is serve hot and tasty . Good choices for dim sum lover. The staff is attending us in good service.
4
Very cosy nice place for chinese food especially dim sum. Variety and quality is good. Quite pricey though unless they have card discounts. Service can be improved. Would consider returning if service is better.
4
Recently reopened Wan Hao exuded a nice classy environment. Had excellent dim sum, though can be rather expensive.
3
Try famous Peking duck, slightly crisp and matched perfectly with traditional Chinese crêpes.Food quality are excellent with good service by the staff.
4
I like the peace and refinement at Wan Hao for dim sum. It is a good alternative to the din of other Chinese restaurants that serve dim sum.Do note that dim sum is orders by the piece here, and charged by each morsel. It is certainly elegant, but expensive too. But the quality of the dim sum warrants the higher price. This is an ideal place for an elegant dim sum lunch .
5
Definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in Singapore. Located in Marriot hotel on level 3, it serves mainly Cantonese cuisine. We generally like the seafood dishes which are fresh and delectable. The carbo staples like fried rice and noodles are extremely delicious on their own too. Service is attentive and swift. It is however fairly expensive.
5
It was super birthday celebration and we enjoyed here at the   Chinese restaurant Wan Hao, Marriots Goa as de food was amazingly tasty. As it was my son's birthday we decided to dine at Marriots and we are happy tat we selected Wan Hao.  Loved de way de waiters served us. All de food items tat we ordered were just perfect and tasty. Mr Saransh Mehen de Manager was very polite and obliging. He made our dinning very enjoyable and we wish him good luck.Sent from Samsung Mobil
3
The food at Wan Hao was nothing to shout about. The only complaint was that the sautéed beef cubes didn't taste fresh. Dim sums were good. However, I felt that the restaurant do not have sufficient wait staff as service was slow, I could feel the frustrations of other diners as well as those on my own table
5
Top notch service , everyone here carries a smile on their face.
Food is excellent , everyone should try their Peking duck with mee Suan .

Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant in Marriott served very nice Cantonese Food. Foot quality are excellent with good service by the staff
5
The olive fried rice is superb! So fragrant and smooth. Tofu with seaweed is pleasant surprise. Had roast chicken too. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a nice dinner in a comfortable environment
5
Delicious cooking. Nice setting of the dishes like Michelin standard of Chinese dishes. Attentive staff. Nice and appropriate Chinese decoration of the restaurant. Soothing music.
5
It's always a satisfying meal in Wan Hao Restaurant. Smiling and friendly waitress and waiters. Conducive environment. Excellent location.
4
I've been to Wan Hao several times. It's in a nice hotel and the location is very central and accessible. Food is generally ok. Nice dim sum that's very sensibly priced. Peking duck, Fried Mee Sua, sweet n sour pork all quite acceptable. I didn't quite like the beef with pear. Not much flavor. Not sure why people raved abt it. I also often order the spinach with 3 eggs. Service: I've had both very good service as well as questionable service here. Seating. This is very important. For a better feeling I would choose to sit in the main dining room. It is elegantly decorated. The side rooms feel a little bare in comparison. Also if possible, ask for a better table. We were once relegated to a table right next to the kitchen entrance. No ambience at all
4
Decided to try something different and to have a traditional Cantonese dinner at Wan Hao while staying at Marriott Singapore. We were well greeted with smiling staff. We were unsure of what to choose not being familiar with the Cantonese menu items. We were served a beautiful champagne while deciding and helped in making a choice of peking duck in all its glory initially the skin wrapped in mini pancakes. The half duck was carefully carved and then prepared for our main course supplemented by an excellent pinot noir. The meal tasty and service was extremely pleasing and all in all a great restaurant experience. The cost with half duck and drinks was just over $100 sgd person and really good value for a quality meal in Singapore. This is not your usual Chinese restaurant and more of a unique style of food and service and a must to try
5
Food are very fresh & tasty! Especially the braised mushroom Ee Fu noodle are cooked just right. The dim sum are served hot and not too salty. Their bbq pork is very unqiue and tasted tender. Service also very swift and advise on the portion to be order so that we didnt end up over order.
5
The food is good. Especially, the signature dish with wasabi tenderloin and also the cod fish is super good.The texture of the beef is really good.The texture if the cod fish is very soft.The asparagus is very crunchy.Their new sesame dessert is also very nice. The staff Ms Mavis and Ms Riva are very gentle with smiling face. Their service are excellent.Will come back again
4
The dim sum is pleasantly good and tasty.
Not to miss the seaweed toufu. It's yummy!
Do try the lemongrass jelly sorbet, it's a must!
4
Food quality is good. The dim sum is superb. Dessert is great. The Peking Duck is a little on the sweet side. Service is pleasant. Music needs improvement though. Elevator music is not conducive for eating.
Will be back for sure.
5
Repeat diner. This dessert is one of the best red bean pan cake I ever had. Must try it if you are here.
Staff here are really friendly and good. The staff try to limit our order not to order too much.
3
Good Dim Sum menu and it give you a feeling of privacy. I like this place because it is not overly crowded and quality of food is above usual dim Sum place. Nice Ambience and the service staff is very attentive.
5
I went to Wan Hao restaurant on 15th April 2016 with an oversea friend. This is our first visit to this restaurant. I must say we were all impressed with the food, highly recommended especially Peking duck and beef tenderloin with plum pear.I would like to give a big thank to Mavis who has given us a warm and friendly welcome with fantastic customer service. She served us attentively throughout the night and recommended good dishes for us.The food was excellent, the service and ambience superb. We will certainly be returning in the near future
4
We loved the wok fried beef tenderloin, even the husband who is not a fan of beef commended it. The poached pear is interesting and tasted more like sour plum. The beef tenderloin is highly recommended.The staff recommended their signature seaweed beancurd and that was a delight.The Peking duck was good, and the leftover meat will be served with rice/noodles.The dim sum was not memorable, we had better ones
5
Peking duck is the best duck I have try before. And Cheng An is very good staff, he is such a handsome man... Humus and gentle. He did a great job. The restaurant environment is quite and beautiful. I like it so much Thanks for the wonderful lunch
5
Had dinner with my friend on 22/4. I ordered roast pork, prawn with truffle, cod fish, Chinese spinach with eggs and mee sua. The mee sua is quite big portion for 2. Will definitely come back to try other yummy dishes and the dim sum too. Highly recommend if you like the dishes that are not too salty and oily.

Great services and good food. Located in Marriot hotel. Love their beef cube and also seaweed tofu with scallop sauce. The staffs are friendly and very engaging. If you have a group visiting, do remember to order the Peking duck, which is one of the best in Spore in my opinion, and the duck meat do choose to cook with noodl

Very few restaurants serve good dim sum & this is one of them. However service can definitely be improved:- we waited a long while at the reception; the waiter who came to help couldn't find my reservation & we waited again- my tea cup was removed while the waiter cleared the plates & he didn't bother to replace- surprised that no complimentary car park as bill was below $150; ate in other hotels and usually complimentary car park was provided above $50 dining.

Really good peking duck. Signature fried rice was good too! Definitely worth visiting. The restaurant service was great.

Came here to celebrate brothers birthday dinner. Great dinner, good food, great service. Signature fried rice was a highlight. William and Riva were great and ensured that our tea glasses were constantly filled. Very enjoyable.

This is a typical but good up-market Chinese hotel restaurant. The food is Cantonese and therefore fairly bland but tasty and well presented. It is not cheap and wine prices are quite over the top.

Good selection of quality food. The Chinese New Year YuSheng is very delicious that I purchased from them for takeaway to serve my guests at home

I am not usually a fan of Dim Sum being vegetarian so a Dim Sum restaurant isn't usually my restaurant of choice. However my friend insisted that this restaurant was different. Being from California, I had no idea that I was about to discover a most exquisite restaurant which offers not only the best dim sum, according to locals, but also offers vegetarian selections!What was most impressive was the location. Wan Hao is located on the 3rd floor of the Marriott Tang Hotel on Orchard Road. If you're just visiting Singapore, Orchard Road is usually where 4-5 star hotels are located as well as high-end luxury brand stores. As I walked into the restaurant, I was escorted in a beautiful booth with what seemed like gold silk shantung drapes with throw pillows encased in gold fabric. I had to wait for my friend so wanted to have a pot of tea. I asked the server what their clients usually order and he said Chrysanthemum tea so I gave that a try. It had a distinct and delicate woodsy taste, rather than floral. It took a bit of getting used to but every sip was quite elegant. My friend arrived and he pre-ordered some vegetarian dishes which was meticulously served one after another with their special sauces. It was heavenly! Even the very simple sauteed Chinese broccoli was divine! I cannot name each dim sum dish that was served but you can call in advance and ask them for their vegetarian offerings. Dining at Wan Hao is a celebration of the senses. You will truly enjoy the experience and you will be proud to invite guests to this restaurant and they will be truly impressed. For a party of 4, request for their booths. It will give you a feeling of privacy and dining in style

7 of us truly dined this evening We shared a set menu served with the diligence, care and concern of pure Asian culture--only topped by the splendor of each successive serving. We started with dumplings and moved to the featured dish--Peking duck The mouth watering entree was followed by shrimp fried rice and wraps. The duck sauce was unbelievable This was a night to remember not only for the dining ambiance and service but for the BEST ever food6 or more stars !!

Visited on 15thMar16' with my colleagues for lunch. Its' opening hour is 12pm but the info given by The Entertainer app is 11am,that caused us to reached there 11:45am n needed to wait. There were others waiting outside too.Actually, wanted to try their signature Peking Duck but I am not entitled to choose as I am using The Entertainer app. We ordered the Deep Fried Crispy Chicken-whole $40. Its skin is crispy n in a big portion for us, should ordered half. Soon Hock fish,800g x $12=$96, the lady suggested us to steam it. Is fresh n taste sweet as it is fresh n we finished it.Fried rice,it contain of diced scallops n shrimp n very tasty too. Eventhough,it is in a small portion but we still can't finished. My colleagues r small eaters. Braised Homemade Beancurd with shredded mushroom on top n spinach,everyone like the beancurd n we finished it.Overall, we just spend $189.50 for 5 persons,its really save a lot using The Entertainer app. We have a very good service experience as they will filled up our cup of chrysanthemum tea consistently. And when I am placing orders,the lady,did recommend we should try which dish n even suggested us on whether having a small or medium portion. There is a gentleman,Roger,should be the manager even came to us to chit chat with us on whether we r satisfied with the food or not. He even asked where we work n where we came from. Like his hospitality way of making guests feel that we r most welcome n his friendliness.

I'm simply going to start with the food. I was on my own and ordered the Australian beef tenderloin with plain rice. The beef was exquisite - perfectly cooked and so soft it almost melted in the mouth. The overall dish was very tasty, but really the flavour and expert cooking of the beef was the hero. Unbelievably, it's one of the cheaper dishes on the menu, so I can only imagine what higher priced items cost. Very generous portion as well. It may seem a little dull to eat in a hotel restaurant with so much choice in Singapore, but this is worth it

We took a friend here whilst staying in Singapore, she lives in the city but had never visited here before.Had a lovely meal, peking duck followed by clam scallop, chicken claypot, duck noodles(using the peking duck remains), beef tenderloin, sweet and sour pork and steamed rice. More than enough for 3 people even with my husband their who eats loads!! Only disappointing dish was the clams, scallops were delicious but the clams were a bit chewy and alot bigger than I'm used to in the UK. We had two glasses of red wine (24 dollars per glass) and a bottle of rose at 98 dollars. Food was good value and would recommend going here. Total bill including all taxes and service 350 dollars
5
had lunch here as part of our seminar package lunch, so wasn't expecting much, but the food turned out to be fabulous, big servings and nice restaurant atmospheredid i mention the food was fantastic? :) the menu included a stir-fried grouper (filleted) which ended up tasting like cod (so fresh and delicious!) the roasted duck was really good too, in fact every dish was wonderful, food was so good we forgot to take pics! :( bumme
5
Peking duck is really good, beef tenderloin peer preserved is also good. Staff are friendly and professional esp Mr.Cheng An, he good took care of us during the meal.
5
Ambiance is gorgeous, staff service are excellent. Food are extremely amazing! Luv the desserts, especially the pomelo sago!
5
Though the restaurant is always packed with guests, the service staff are always attentive and polite, especially the manager Jenny and Mavis. Good recommendation of food. Keep up the good job.
5
Kurobata pork, popular Wan Hao fried rice. Every dish was wonderful and good.
Even though it was busy, the staff were attentive to our requests. Good job!

Have a good environment,Nice dessert and yummy food ,all without msg ,steamed hair crab meat dumpling and wok-fried rice,service with smiling face

Using the entertainer app we had a pretty good deal with two mains free. Unfortunately we were unable to try their dimsum , which they are famous for. We ordered the Australian beef, speciality fried rice , deep fried chicken and seaweed bean curd for a family of 3 . I felt that they did the meats perfectly , whilst the fried rice and bean curd were just a tad above average . Service desperately needs to be improved; not once did they top up our tea and it took ages for the bill To arriv

Our dinner dinning experience with Wan Hao on 13th Dec 2015As a regular patron to your esteemed hotel's dinning outlets, I have organised a dinner party of six, with our two German guests whom happened to be the Grand Hyatt Hotel guests next door to your hotel. I have strongly recommended Wan Hao as the venue of our dinner party from my past good experience when dinning with Wan Hao.I must said that the quality of the foods was excellent, except for a few hiccups which I think I should bring to your kind attention.(1) There was only one table of guests in the dinning room assigned to us when we arrived. We were the second table and later on came in another third table of guests. So there were in total only three tables of guests.(2) The foods were served in a very fast pace as a result and then it halted for half an hour before the last disc of fried chicken was served. At first we had suspected one item was missing and asked for the waiter to check, but the answer from him was that all orders had been served. We asked again to check the order book and then he realised that one item was missing. That was the reason it took more than half an hour to serve the last item.(3) There was no change of plates despite we had ordered 7 discs of foods. We were almost forced to use the same plate for the seven discs, if it was not because of the big delay for the last item. The waiter only changed our plates after we have consumed the six discs, before waiting for half an hour for the final disc. I found this kind of service level unacceptable in your esteemed 5-starred hotel dinning. This was definitely not the Wan Hao that I used to know.(4) The quality of the chrysanthemum tea was far from satisfactory. Please take a good look of your tea leaves quality. It tasted like plain hot water.(5) When we asked for the complementary parking after the dinner, we were told that only one free parking per $150 spent. We were short of $3.40 to have entitled to the second car (please refer to the attached bill). Why this rigid regimental rule? Does it mean that if I have come alone and dined for less than $150, I would not be given a free parking treatment by your esteemed hotel

We went for dinner, without any reservation we can just walked in and get our preferred table. The service was good. Worth mentioned was the cod dish as the cod was very tender and moist. Other dish such as barbecued pork was okay. Roast duck was also okay
1
We went there for there hairy crab. This was during hairy crab season and while the restaurant was having hairy crab special with a dedicated menu for hairy crab. We arrived around 7pm, quite early for dinner, but already they were out of crab. Unbelievable, we almost felt a bit cheated. We also asked for a nice table as it was our anniversary (on the phone), which they confirmed. But when we came in, they told us that they cannot give us a nice table (even though there were still some nice booths available) because we should have asked for it on the phone...the food was ok, but nothing too revealing, you can get better Chinese food in SNG. One of the items we ordered, they did not bring, and after all the disappointment, which we shared with them, to charge 10SGD for one glass of coke, are you kidding me? We were very disappointed to say the least
4
Wan Hao provides a cozy and relaxed atmosphere to enjoy your Cantonese delicacies. We had their popular Dim Sum selection e.g. Shanghai Hairy Crab and Shrimps dumplings, Siew Mai, etc. and the stir fried seafood hor fun, etc. Everything was good; including the ever attentive service that ensured your cup is always filled with tea.
5
The servers in Wan Hao was very friendly and kindly! Especially, May and Marilyn , who made us enjoying our dinner! And the food was good also！
5
Ordered famous Peking Duck, beef cubes, prawns, Kurobata pork, popular Wan Hao fried rice. Every dish was wonderful and tasted good. Service was earnest but at times slow as restaurant was full given Sat night. Highly recommended, and ensure you make reservation for weekend dining!
5
Top class chinese food.Not the run of the mill food.Wait staff make you feel very special.we got a booth which made it very personal Highly recommended
5
Service staff was very polite and directed me to the food menu which i am unable to select the course. i enjoyed the roasted chicken and the comfortable environment over there, i will come back again to enjoys the food there. Keep it up!
5
The staff here have very great knowledge of the menu and have very good service. Professional and very friendly. Food is also excellent!
4
Came here for lunch after a recommendation and I have to say the food was good as was the service. We all had something different and just shared the dishes. Very good. I'll definitely be back
5
If you haven't already known, this restaurant is located within the 5 star Marriot Hotel in Orchard Rd. Ambience and decor of the restaurant is very nice. The Dim Sum here is of high quality and yummy and at very reasonable price for a restaurant of this category. And the best part is - you can order each dim sum item in individual portions! Very suitable if you are dining alone or with just one other person. Service is pleasant but restaurant seems understaffed
4
This place has excellent dim sum! I also had a birthday dinner at this restaurant and both courses were great. This is the place office workers bring friends to when they say 'let me show you a great place to eat', I guess, as most of the patrons I saw during my visits were in office wear or coats; the restaurant is happy to serve families as well
4
Had a good experience during a business dinner some months back and returned here for a dim sum lunch with family. Ordered the usual - chicken feet, roast meat platter. Those 2 were good, but not excellent. The pork rib was less good. The signature crispy chicken was excellent and comes with fried Chinese "dao ki", a kind of soya derivative. The fried vermicelli (mee sua ) was also very goodService was patchy. Excellent and average , depending on the server and what we neede
4
Went to Wan Hao to try out their set dinner. Quality is pretty high ; the chicken soup and beef are really delicious! Staff are very friendly, genuine and always drop by to check on us if everything is okay. However, the waiting time is pretty long, Despite that fact that I have called in to reserve a few days in advance, I still gotta wait for almost 15mins to just to get seated. There were obvious lack of manpower, and lack of service at the start. This is probably one area they need to look into as first impression counts!However, as time goes by, with more dishes being served, the service improved gradually and the staffs apologised to us for the inconvenience caused. I will love to go back again soon

Went here with my family to celebrate my fathers birthday. The food was nice and the service was excellent. We were served by Lin Kuan Yu who was a friendly,approachable and prompt in his service and made our evening so pleasant

Food acceptable but the fried rice is bit salty.
Environment and service is good.
Will introduced friend family colleagues to here and try the food and dim sum.

For our first visit to this restaurant, it was a pleasant experience. Good food and excellent service (a Singaporean by the name of Ben). Ben certainly know his trade and recommended well. Will definitely go back again for another family dinner.

Have been going to Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant for over 20 years. In the last 9 months all the staff have been changed and the service and food quality have gone down tremendously which is a pity since it was the best Chinese Restaurant in Singapor
3
We were staying at the Marriott so for speed we decided to eat at Wan Hao upstairs.This was a mistake. It was busy but this should be no excuse.Drinks took 15 mins to arrive then the food arrived much much later and at different times.Two of us had finished our mains before the third main arrived.Shame really as the food was quite good!Won't bother agai
5
We had a very nice relaxing and full of flavor for all lunch. The service was very attentive and yet subtle, giving you privacy and a wonderful care at the same time. Interesting and creative selection of dim sum, just right cooked noodles and small duck dishes made our lunch a wonderful time for the whole family. We will be back :

Me and my wife were there for a dinner on 3.4.2015. I have made a reservation for 2 and requested for a cozy corner. We were given a very comfortable and cozy cushion seats good for 4 pax. We had a superd dinner and chat thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance and food of the restaurant. The food though a little pricey was of very good quality. The staffs were very attentive to our needs. Among them all, i wish to especially thank May - who is very friendly, chatty and took good care of our needs and dining experience. Despite busy running about serving different diners, she was patient enough to take time off to explain and recommend to us the restaurant's current promotion and chef's recommended menu. I will not hesitate to go back to Wan Hao Restaurant and recommend this restaurant to my friends. Lawrenc

I had dinner here with my family. What a delightful experience ! The food was delicious , the friendly service made our evening so enjoyable! Thanks Mavis and Cleo. I will defiantly suggest this place to all my friends.

Frequent Wan Hao for their dim sum. It is better than some of the restaurants in Hong Kong. In fact, Wan Hao serve excellent variety of dim sum and using good ingredients. Unlike the rest, Wan Hao made good quality dim sum - the skin of the siu mai, har kau and other dumpling dishes are delicate and thin. You get to taste the freshness of the food and all are prepared when you order, not those overly steamed or cooked type. The only drawback is that they only serve dim sum for lunch. So dinner will be an entirely different set of menu, which I feel that the standard of food is slightly different. Say, I would rate the dim sum 9.8/10 and dinner 6/10. I tried their dinner once and the food were kind of mediocre. The crispy chicken was hard and dry, the beef horfun was a little too oily... The Peking duck was great though and it is available for lunch too. Average $$$ Spent:Lunch Dim Sum is about S$15-$25 per pax. Marriott Club Member get a 50% discount when dining in 2 pax! Dinner is about S$40-60. Discount for Marriott Club Member available too. Overall Service: 9/1
5
I and girlfriend went to the restaurant in February. I was the restaurant staff are very friendly welcome. Restaurant staff introduced the famous restaurant dishes for us to choose, with reasonable price, we had one great dinne
4
Had a wonderful lunch here with my colleague and the food was really good thanks to Ben who recommended us the signature peking duck and a couple of other dim sum dishes and soup that complimented the duck very well. Portion sizes were quite generous and service provided by Ben and his team members were not only efficient, but warm and inviting. I would definitely recommend this place
4
Had both lunch and dinner at Wan Hao when I stayed at Marriott Singapore.They served good Tim Sum lunch and the price was reasonably. Didn't have much Tim Sum variety but do enjoyed the service.In the evening I tried their ala carte menu and the food are good and value for money. Staff are polite and professional
5
decided to have a quick dinner with a friend. But Cross Road was full and we proceed to Wan Hao for dinner. Must said service was very attentive. great venue for business dinner as table are well space with loads of privacy. we ordered their Piking duck, beijing cabbage, pepper chicken, fried mee sua and iberico char siew. Dishes were spot on and delicious. will definitely come back for their tim sum again.
5
Came back the second time for dinner with my family. We were recommended the special Hong Kong dishes that a Hong Kong chef flew all the way to Singapore. We tried the pork cutlet with spring onion and oh boy it was good! It was known to be available for a limited period of time. Overall service was fantastic!! Even though it was busy, the staff were attentive to our requests. Good job!
5
As usual,I was with my husband having dinner at this Chinese restaurant...Surprisingly the food recommeded by the waiter Frank was very delicious! He knew that my husband loves to eat the Japanese cod fish which was already in the menu, he recommeded that we should give a try on the newly introduced cod fish that is prepared in a dual way: pan-fried and deep-fried! we were really amazed that we can still taste the freshness of the fish after being deep-fried. we hope that this dish can put in the menu for those cod fish lover like us
4
For a local, I've never heard of this place until a friend recommended me. It boasts a quiet ambience although some background music would be good! Tried some of the dim sum they had and I would say that they tasted delicious although not outstanding, especially for the price we are paying. The Dim sum came in 2 pieces, which was rather pricey and not enough to share. Of course they use good quality ingredients and we pay for the ambience. I like the custard bun which was one of the best I've had. The Soup was very yummy and nourishing too. I Like the fried rice which was cooked with generous servings of scallops.The staff were friendly and also helpful. They were prompt in their service and recommended the dishes to us. They also made the effort to ask their customers how the food was and how the service went
4
I had the pleasure of enjoying 4 excellent meals at Wan Hao. 3 together with my wife and one on my own.The food was always excellent, and it's nice to "go out on a limb" and try things I've never tried before. The service is good, most of the time, though could do with some improvement.I'll definitely be back again next time I'm in Singapore
5
Excellent food and service, beautiful decour. A must if you like Chinese food! I recommend the Peking duck and bbq dumplings.
5
The young lady who served us at dinner was fantastic but I forgot her name. Food was great and will definitely come back. Will recommend to friends who will visit Singapore!
5
we had a great dining expirence at wan hao restaurant. we were greeted by Cleo which direct us to our seat. And she made great recommendations. Food was excellent.Service was fantastic! Thank you !
4
Dined at Wan Hao restaurant for the first time with my friends. Tried their dim sum and I thought it was unique. They had this squid-ink kind of dumpling, abalone siew mai and their carrot cake melts in your mouth! Fantastic ambience! Quiet and intimate.
5
We had a delightful multi-course menu. Especially the service was very professional and courteous! Highly recommend this place. Congratulation to the management.
3
The food was excellent, please let me start there for the sake of the chef. It really was good. However, as is often the case with travel accross timezones we started dinner late and were advised at 21:30 that the restaurant was soon to close. Normally this means last orders must be in soon... Here it meant we will bring you the bill while you are still eating at 22:03 and ask you for your card. Completely destroyed the dinner... In a hotel like the Marriott, I am sure if the restaurant cashier had to be closed they could have transferred to the reception - service is about the customer experience, not your internal problems. This restaurant can do better
4
It's been 10 years since I last came here, and we had a business dinner with 30 people tonightPre-ordered a set menu of 5 dishes, and there were hits and misses. The appetiser of jellyfish and cold drunken chicken was good. The chawamushi with crab claw was very good. The plate of plain broccoli is ridiculous and shouldn't even be a dish. The rice in lotus leaf was ok. The dessert red bean soup I couldn't care for. They threw in a glass of house wine per person. All these for $68 per person, debatable whether this is value for moneyThe fruit juice was $15. WowProbably would have rated this average but the service was great. Young staff, but very well trainedWill try to return for dim sum and private dinner to test out the real food quality next time
3
Service at Wan Hao is impeccable. The service team while young, are trained well. So kudos to the management. However, I am less impressed with the quality of food. We ordered 4 dishes - Spanish Pork Char Siew (because the suckling pig we originally ordered was sold out), Three Eggs with Spinach in Broth, Fried Rice and Sweet and Sour Pork. The first disappointment was being told the suckling pig was sold out. Next we were told the Chinese spinach typically used in the Three Eggs Spinach Dish is also out. Can the kitchen replace with another type of spinach. We said ok else we would have went elsewhere for dinner at that point...When I am told Spanish pork, I am thinking Iberico pork which should be fragrant and juicy. The pork char siew was served in long, thin slices, quite different from how other restaurants would slice their char siew. The char siew looks gleaming and tastes sweet. The shortfall is that out of the plate of few slices, only two slices were meat. The rest were either high in fats or all fats. Not melt in the mouth kind of ooey fat but the can't bite through kind of fat. We didn't finish this dish.The three egg spinach was very average. I kinda thought the three types of eggs would blend with the vegetable and soup harmoniously, or at least that is my limited understanding of the dish. The one served was like looking at three strangers placed together in a plate. It didn't help this type of spinach doesn't absorb much of the goodness from the soup stock.The sweet and sour pork was decent. The meat does not taste frozen, which is a relief. It was tender and well fried. The sauce is probably a higher class sweet and sour blend. Its more brown than red and tastes more of hawthorn/plum, I am not sure. Not really my cup of tea. The fried rice was probably the best dish. The rice grains were coated with a thin film of oil which is how good fried rice should be. The two improvements I would say is not to overcook the seafood and use a better grade of rice. This one no matter how good the frying, was unable to release the full fragrance. I guess I had expected much more from a high-end restaurant especially in simple dishes like these. Perhaps I will return some day to try the dim sum which seems to have a strong fusion flavour and possibly a specialty of the chef
3
Tucked in a pleasant environment, Wan Hao is quite a place for good Chinese cuisine. Service was average but some food were not up to standards, we ordered this tofu dish and it was super salty, feedbacked to the staff but as a 5-star hotel, they did not offer a complimentary dish or other makeups. Disappointed with this point. Not coming back
5
Excellent service. Attentive staff . Cleo was marvellous. She made excellent recommendations. The staff were sharp. The steamed fish was marvellously cooked and the crispy chicken was very good. The restaurant has a superb dessert dragonfruit lemongrass jelly red wine granita. would love if the portion were bigger.

Hong kong chef promotion:
Pleasant dinner at Wan Hao, especially enjoyable experience served by service staff Moon and May. Enjoyed the Baked Crab Claw Puffs with diced chicken and cheese & the Sliced Roasted Suckling Pig.
Yum!
5
My first experience with this restaurant on 23/7. Is really a nice dining experience in the restaurant. The service crew are very professional. Especially for Moon Ng and Mavis, they are very professional and providing excellent service, very friendly and helpful.
5
I had a nice dinner with my friends at wan hao. It was my first time here and really enjoyable.Especially our server Cleo, she is very friendly and helpful. I will be back again!
5
I still love Wan Hao's way of preparing this dish. Crispy, juicy and tasty Peking dick skin is wrapped with the "popiah" skin. It is one of the best I ate.
5
The restaurant has great ambience. And the staffs are very professional! Dim sum is great. Love the fried vegetables and char Siew buns.
4
It's been a while I have been back at wan hao but it did not fail me. Brought mom and son for lunch and there's is great food and service. Special mention to Moon though there are many people she is still attentive and friendly.
5
Came for lunch with my family. The lobster nooldles are highly recommended. The assistant manager Moon and her team are very friendly and attentive. Nice quiet atmosphere with great food. Will definitely be back again.
4
Overall experience is great! Served by the friendly and professional crew of Wan Hao, especially May and Moon which completes the whole dining experience. Guest chef from award-winning Dynasty Restaurant was here and we did not hesitate and have to try that. Food was good specially the roast pork, and baked crab claw puff
4
We went here for a quick dinner with friends (they booked as a surprise) whilst on a brief visit to Singapore. This was a deviation away from our normal Chinese restaurant staples. Restaurant is traditional in decor and located in the Marriot on Orchard so nice and central. This is great place to go for a less formal business dinner or just as couples grabbing a bite after shopping on Orchard. Food was good and in line with what you would expect from a hotel restaurant - good but not super fine dining. The best part of our meal - the service. Cleo was attentive and understood the menu extremely well. One of the advantages of never eating anywhere other than your normal restaurants is you do not need to read the menu - Cleo helped me navigate this menu with minimum effort on my part .Food choices were excellent, especially the Duck. Will definitely be bac

I am quite a regular patron of the Wan Hao restaurant and today my wife and I had the best sweet and sour pork in Singapore there. We also had the beef with wasabi sauce and plum flavoured pear and today they did it very very wel

My family and I were there for Fathers Day celebration. It was a wonderful dinner with the menu set by your staff, May. We were very happy and thankful for the wonderful service of your waitstaff; Jack, Moon and Chuna.
5
Had my birthday dinner served by May. Really impressed by her dedicated service. Very cheerful and entertaining. Appreciate her service attitude. Would definitely come again for the food and her. Thank you for a great evening.
cheers...
5
i and my wife had dinner and served by Moon, great service and very enjoyable dinner! Will dine there again.

Went for the a la carte buffet lunch, not so worth for the price of 68++, I find it rather overpriced. Mediocre food quality. Huating at Orchard Hotel can do a better and cheaper job!
5
We celebrated our mum's 90 birthday last Friday, the serving team are very attentive, well mannered from planning to execution, helping us to host a great dinner celebration!
5
Celebrated my birthday here with my family. Received impeccable and thoughtful service from the staff, particularly from our server May. The food was delicious and also good value for money. Conducive and lovely environment.
5
I was here last week for a family dinner. The staff was really helpful and friendly and food was just fantastic. One of the best cantonese cuisine served here
5
This Chinese restaurant serves premium dim sum and creative Chinese dishes. The service staff are extremely friendly and committed to delight. Special mention goes to Moon and May for their dedication and setting good examples for the newbies. The restaurant is located at the heart of Orchard Road with easy access from main modes of public transport. Strongly recommend for families and close friends
5
I was here for my dad's birthday along with my families. Was very impressed with the operators who managed my booking, and even more impressed with the service provided when we are at the restaurant. For 8 adults, 2 toddlers and 1 child, we only paid 400+ for a dinner! The food are delicious! Basically we cleared every single plate. Very attentive waitresses and very well-mannered. My parents are happy with the meal & we will definitely take the restaurant into consideration for our next family gathering
5
Food was delicious, ordered their Beijing duck, roast pork, char siew slices, stir fried prawns, egg white broccoli and beef(can't remember the name).The beef dish was superb! It was extremely soft and tender and it went well with the wasabi sauce. They also had a plum soaked pear that compliments the strong flavour of the beef!The stir fried prawns were also above expectations. The prawn head was crisp and delicious! I don't usually eat prawn heads because of the "fishy" smell, but the prawns in the dish were cooked marvelously.If you're taking slightly longer than expected to order your food, the waiters will ask if you're ready about once every 4-5 mins. Some people may find them a little "pushy" or impatient, but I thought it is good initiative because we can avoid the hassle of grabbing their attention afterwards when we're ready.You can also ask the waiters to recommend what is nice in the menu. Our waiter was extremely helpful and suggested we order the stir fried prawn and the crab meat egg white broccoli. Both the suggested dishes didn't fail to impress.For dessert we had mango pudding and a bowl of almond paste. The almond paste is REALLY thick and it smells delightful, people in the older generation would definitely love it. Mango pudding was sweet and light, just what I needed to end the beautiful meal. I will definitely come back again
5
Was there for Mother's Day celebration. Ordered their chef speciality Fried Prawns with dried shrimps which is really tasty.. Roasted pork is really crispy without much fats.. The staff were friendly and able to customised to our needs.. Will come back again..

Recently I was there for a birthday dinner with friends at Wan Hao. Food and service was great. Had a wonderful meal.
Looking forward to bring my family to try out their Dim Sum.

Food is great and they can cater/customize to your needs. We dine there for the service as well. Highly recommended.

Great tim sum, some variety slightly different from others. Price on the high side but you pay more for quality. The Sichuan sour and spicy need some improvement, too sweet.
My friends favorite is the cold drunken prawns, fresh and sweet.

I was here last month and decided to try the dim sum buffet after my pleasant visit.It is actually a 5 course lunch with unlimited order of dim sum at $68++Menu for the lunch is really good with orders like suckling pig, abalone and lobster.Remember to place a booking as it is usually full house

My group of friends and I gathered here for my birthday on 30th April, which was a day before holiday.When we reached there, we were welcomed by the restaurant manager, who brought us to our table.He proceeded to serve us the appetizer, shrimp wrapped in a thinly sliced cucumber. It was a great start to what was coming soon after.We had the roast pork, the skin was crispy and it was great with the white wine we ordered.Next was the Peking duck, which the waitress sliced on the table right next to ours. All I want to say is good food and excellent presentation!I'll be back for more pampering, soon

Recently, I have just brought my German colleague to dine at Wan Hao, he was very impressed with the friendly service and excellent food.The Peking duck and Fragrant prawns (Chef's Specially) were excellent. Must try !Wan Hao offers delicious meals without the MSG.A pleasant place for enjoying great food

Its was my mother's birthday and we decided to explore Wan Hao for dinner. Good food coupled with excellent services is what i am looking for in F & B outlets and Wan Hao did it! The signature dishes recommended by the manager were excellent!Service staffs were just beside you when you needed something.I would love to go back and try the weekend dim sum buffet which was highly promoted by the waitress
