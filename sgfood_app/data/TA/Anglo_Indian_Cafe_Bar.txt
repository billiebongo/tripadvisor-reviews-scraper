I have visited the Chijmes outlet twice with friends and family. Nice ambience, Super courteous staff even if u go through eatigo.
Delicious mutton biryani and peach cooler apart from other dishes. Adequate portions. Definitely recommended.

This place has the most incredible food but their butterchicken is absolutely astonishing! Its an incredible blend of smokey, sweet yet subtlety spicy flavour. Its easy to find at the Chijmes centre and easy to get to using the MRT system.

I came here with my boyfriend and his family. We had a wonderful time as the service staff were really friendly and helpful. The food was also amazing and I have never tasted such authentic Indian food anywhere else in Singapore. The servings were appropriate and not very heavy. Do try the garlic and cheese naan and butter chicken. The briyani was also a must try as their presentation is unlike anywhere else. The best part? Happy hour is throughout the whole day and night! My group paid significantly less than other expected

I have visited both the Shenton Way as well as the newly opened Chijmes locations of Anglo Indian Cafe Bar. This review is particularly to recommend the Chijmes location.In my recent business trip to Singapore (4th to 10th Jan '18) I stumbled upon the newly appointed Anglo Indian Cafe at Chijmes and was particularly thrilled by its superb location, easy ambience, discreet-yet-attentive staff and food which can appeal to any palate. Vinod Jakhmola you have a winner in your hands. I was in staying at Peninsula Excelsior on Coleman St. and found Chijmes an easy, walk-able distance. I have experienced the Shenton Way outlet of AICaBa, hence was pleasantly surprised to encounter the same @ Chijmes. Out of the 6 nights I stayed at S'pore, I ate 04 superb dinners @ Anglo Indian Cafe Bar @ Chijmes.A definite must-visit for all lovers of Indian food. They have perfectly cracked the menu

Their food is fantastic. I am not a fan of butter chicken, but was astounded how good it was that I had a few helpings. The Naan bread was soft and warm, lamb kebabs juicy and fish curry simply fresh and tender. Truly recommend this place for a good value Indian meal. I must come back and try the biryani soon!

I am a big fan of the original Anglo Indian café in the CBD. So, the experience at the Chijmes outlet came as a shock! It’s like it has completely different ownership and management. The menu is much shorter, the service is taciturn (vs. warm and welcoming at the downtown location). Most importantly, the food is not good. The CBD outlet’s biryani is one of the best in town - with fragrant steam coming out when you cut open the pastry cover; here, it’s just warm. The prawn curry is too salty. Even the papadum is soggy! Unacceptable at $42 per head

Awesome place for good chill out with friends , not too noisy yet the ambience alike bar and restaurant gives you the bar dinning experience . Service was good, very attentive and knowledgeable. Food was good. I highly recommend good place for dinning, drink and awesome chill out place

Great food and exceptional service. Went here with another couple whilst in Singapore, found this treasure and was pleased that we did. Couldn't fault anything. By the end of the meal the plates looked like they had just come out of the dishwasher. Garlic naan was perfect. Will go agai
5
Ive been staying in SG for three years now and never have I had such nice food.Go for the chefs recommended items. The chicken tikka was tender and the hari makkai were absolutely brilliant. Visited the Chimes outlet and there is no indoor sitting area. service is great! and the food is totally value for money!
5
$60 for really excellent food and a large beer. Best onion bahji I have had in a very long time and the recommended Captain's Chicken was really tasty. Friendly and efficient service is a real bonus
4
Stmbled upon Anglo Indian Cafe by chance in Chijmes and was pleasantly surprised by both the quality of the food and the service! If you go during the happy hour then prices are reasonable too. Worth a visit. Ask for Shahid
4
Did not expect to find such good Indian food in this area. Reasonably priced drinks too. Unfortunately there's no air-conditioning!
5
Food here is amazing. If you crave authentic Indian food, this is the place you should try. They're Naan is amazing. You should try their Butter Chicken curry.
5
Consistently excellent chicken tikka masala / butter chicken! Succulent and mouth watering. Attentive service at this hidden local gem.
4
good taste, fast service, reasonable price, good quantity, you can select from large menu. Seating in open area is good,
5
Loved the food at this restaurant! Everything was cooked to perfection.
My favourite was the Tandoor Chicken Briyani which is cooked inside the clay oven, which is so authentic! A must visit!
4
Great indian starters. The mix grill was good. The chaat needs a special mention. Avoid the chicken nachos though. Not one of their strong points.
The happy hour are drinks for CBD location. Service is excellent. Very polite staff.

We have been popping in to the Anglo Indian pretty much since we moved to the city centre, and it is about time I said thanks to themNo frills, no fine dining, but the guys in there are great, they are so accommodating, give my Wife a little extra in her glass of wine now and again, surprise is with a discount now and again, we never ask, but I think they like to just exceed expectations.To be brutally honest I have not gone through their entire menu, for one simple reason, I cannot get past not ordering their railway mutton, just the best, so me saying it is one of my favourite restaurants is somewhat flawed as I have really only had a few dishes, but for my pallet, absolutely love it.Thanks guys and see you next wee
5
This restaurant is located quite centrally in the Chijmes and I popped in here for a late lunch.I had a couple of samosas and lamb railway curry with a roti. The food was very good, especially the railway curry. My pint of beer was half price at SIN$10 due to happy hour.The total bill was just over $SIN50, which was reasonable value for this part of town. The service was good, and the restaurant itself was clean and modern
4
Enjoyed taste of Indian original dal makhani and tandoori roti in Singapore .well behaved,hindi /English speaking staff.
4
Good place to have casual dining along with friends/colleagues in CBD. I like their breads along with delicious chicken tikka masala. Food is bit expensive but justified by location & taste.
5
This Restaurant is situated at Asia Square. And the indian food quality is very good as always delicious. All staffs are very friendly.
5
Visited the place with some friends, the ambience was amazing. And we ordered north indian Samosas and pakodas with Masala Tea. I can just they were delicious and served very well.
Highly recommend to visit the cafe... :)

We went for a late lunch to Anglo Indian over a weekend.As it was the weekend and late, the restaurant was fairly empty. Once I got there, I recollected that they'd been open earlier under the name of British India.We tried quite a few dishes. The Chicken Tikka wrap was fairly good and the sauce gave it a nice flavor. The Papri Chat was surprisingly delicious and we liked this dish the best.The Onion Bhaji could have been better. I think its round shape did not really lend itself to frying well. The Lamb Sheekh Kabab was fairly good as well.I'd go here for a nice relaxed bite over a weekend
5
When you are tired of Lau Pa Sat check out Anglo Indian, its just across the road under the One Shenton towers, we live locally so often visit for dinner or just a drink. The prices are very resonable for the area and the Paulaner beer is a great deal at $10 per pint, the menu has enough options to keep going back and the food is very good, not to mention the staff and management, always smiling and happy to help
4
Visit Anglo Indian Cafe on weekend lunchOrdered butter chicken, steam rice and mango lassi.Lassi is not special bit too sweet.Butter chicken is nice but volume of food is too much for one person.Good location visit after jogging or cycling.If price is below $20 nice but over $30 for this oder is expensive
5
Located directly in the heart of central business district offering sumptuous Indian food for a good value. Was here celebrating my friends birthday after work and the boss was very gracious to extend us 50% off our 15 Pax dinner celebration on TOP of free alcoholic drinks after our initial purchase. The food was very good and staff was very attentive. A definite to come back.
4
We ordered take out biryani for lunch - and was overall a fairly good experience. My colleagues enjoyed the mutton biryani, but I found the veg one average. What was good though that the person we called to place the order was helpful and three in curry, raita and papad and also gave cutlery for sharing the biryani. Overall a good experience
5
I went for the chef's recommendation which was the Anglo Indian chicken dish, and ordered naan to go with it. The naan was chewy and not overly dry. Gravy was of the right viscosity and not too spicy. Chicken pieces were big and tender. Same goes for my lunch partner's bryani. They were also generous with their portions but it does satisfy a very hungry person just right. Cost wise is about 30 bucks per person with an order of drink as well.Shenton Way is always jammed pack with lunch crowds on weekdays, but it's pretty easy to get a seat here without reservation.In summary, I liked it
3
This place in downtown is located near the downtown station but the food is of poor standards.Though the service and ambience is good food can be better.I
5
I went there with few workmates on 30th May 2016 for lunch. The food is excellent. Specially the chicken tikka. Service is great and the food arrived in no time. Highly recommend if you are around the area.
4
Great tasting chicken tikka masala with garlic nan and papadum. Free Indian pickles and dips. Service is quick and efficient and provides a good place to go for a working lunch.
5
Nice casual dining ambience in a business district
Great biryani and breads. Wonderful starters and mains. Must try mocktails
4
I got lost looking for another restaurant and i do not regret stopping by this nice restaurant.
might be a bit crowded before 1PM though
I enjoyed a Chicken Tikka and Nan which i had not eaten for years !
4
Anglo Indian is a favourite place for a casual lunch meeting, the set lunch is always good and more than enough food. Highly recommend the Mango Lhassi, they do a pretty good coffee too
4
Four of us eat at this restaurant for lunch. We ordered four different curries and lots of Nan. They were all very tasty. The lamb was good, but a couple of pieces a little chewy. Otherwise everything was very good.. The service was prompt, polite and teh food came out pretty quickly. The restaurant offers lots of outdoor seating that is generally shaded, but can be a bit uncomfortable on a hot muggy day in Singapore. There are only a few tables inside with AC. Will definitely return
4
We went in a group for a dinner on Friday night. The restaurant serves Paulaner beer on tap which was a refreshing pair up with the spicy indian cuisine. We ordered the garlic naan, butter chicken, chicken tikka, among others. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and how palatable the dishes were.The boss of the establishment was very friendly and humourous
4
I really enjoyed the service at Anglo Indian. They try to be attentive and to provide everything which is needed in time.The food was good and I would say that it would be worth returning for. Samosas and chickpea curry were very tasty with the right amount of spices.Overall I would say prices are in line with the quality of food and service provided
4
The food here is really delicious. We ordered a mutton biryani and butter chicken and the latter was melt in your mouth! My one tip is to read the bill carefully. We initially received a bill which we were happy with and paid but when the change came we realised the amount was wrong and the bill accompanying the change had been modified to include a soup we never ordered. I'm usually inclined to give the benefit of the doubt in these situations but the fact that the bill was identical but for that soup and that upon complaining we received the right amount of change with our original bill makes me suspicious. I advise checking your bill carefully here
4
We ate at the outlet at Raffles. It is one of the best places for good quality Indian food in Singapore. Quantity is quite good but its expensive. Service is very good and staff is friendly. Good range of veg options as well.
4
Restaurant was close to the Westin where we were staying. Had 2 meals at this restaurant which were both really tasty and well priced. Quiet on both nights that we were there which appealed to us. Would definitely go back.
4
It was a friends-biz lunch. The food that we ordered was good, tasty and balanced. We had some nice juices. Service was attentive and overall good.
2
This is an crazy expensive place. Be ready to digest horny stare from waiter...will not go back for sure..
5
While the location is not spectacular, the Indian food is ! ... and then they serve the amazing Paulaner beer on tap. Service is abovs local standard. One of my favorite restaurants to go in Singapore
4
Found this place behind the new Sofitel hotel. The food and beer were good and reasonably priced. Sat outside, and a number of the tables were busy with people drinking.
4
Dropped in at this outlet on tw separate occassions with colleagues on business trips to SGP. Both times ordered the British Connection - absolutely awesome crumb-fried marinated fish fillets with chips... washed down with some excellent light beer. My colleagues tried the vindaloo, naan, and chicken biriyani and said the taste was authentic Indian. Good food and friendly service... though a bit expensive
4
It's one of those places that wouldn't catch your attention unless you work in the CBD of Singapore and frequent the Asia Square area during office lunch hours...I visited this place in Feb'15 on one of the evenings after spending some time at the Marina Bay Sands, and landed here for an Indian dinner.And were we amazed! Great food- especially the Chicken Tikka Masala was easily the best Indian gravy I've had in town even since we moved to Singapore about 5 months back. This place is a bit expensive for daily fare, at about SGD 55-65 for a meal for 2 (excluding drinks), but the food is good and is definitely worth a try
4
Had lunch there.chicken tikka, Paneer tikka, lemonade, Rasmali.Each item was 10/10The amibience of the place is so so. And the crowd there is massive at lunch time.The owner was all over the place seeking feedback. I really liked that.Recommended highly - Especially if you like authentic Indian food
5
We have been there many times during lunch break. It is a nice restaurant serving Indian Food. We like the Chicken TIkka Masala and Prawn curry. The price is reasonable.Special mention their service. The service is excellent. Friendly, fast and attentive. A great place for business meeting too
