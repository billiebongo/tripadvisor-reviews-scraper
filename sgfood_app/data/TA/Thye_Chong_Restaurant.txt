Despite the Chinese sounding name and the Chinese script on the sign, this is very much an Indian restaurant. We had visited before on a previous visit to Singapore many years ago, so decided on a nostalgic visit.The portion sizes are quite small, but they are also very cheap. for two people 4 dishes seemed about the right quantity. The chappatis are very fresh (and very hot) and again, we found 3 each to be about right. The restaurant is very basic and not remotely luxurious, but the food is very good and the service is fast. One of the tastiest meals we had in 3 weeks.Unfortunately we went on two more occasions (around 7:30pm) but it was closed both times. We couldn't understand why, as despite it being just after Chinese New Year, i would not have expected an Indian establishment to be close

We had the Spicey Lamb mince and freshly made Chapata bread, it was delicious authentic food. I also found one of the best tasting and looking beers in Singapore, Kingfisher Blue Also the best tasting juice called Sagiko Soursop en getrÃ¤nk (I have fotos of these two drinks included)Enjoy!

Located on the corner of Serangoon Road (Main Road of Little India) and Norris Road. A long review for a meal that cost $4.60 for two people! We liked the image, through the window, of the man cooking bread in the Tandoori. So we went in. This is basic Indian food. Full olf locals, no tourists except for us. Very good service for what it is, with two quite old men helping out at "front of house'. My wife and I tried the vegetarian potato and peas with chapati for around $1.30 each dish, for a tapas size serving and about $1 for the bread. It was so tasty and we liked it so much, we went around for a second serving. I can't comment on the quality of the meat dishes, but I am sure any of the other vegetarian dishes would be as tasty as we had. There is a kiosk at the end of the restaurant selling beer.My wife talks about this as being the best restaurant we went to on our Singapore and Vietnam trip
