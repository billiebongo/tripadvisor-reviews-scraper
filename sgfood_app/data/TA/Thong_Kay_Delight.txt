This is the best carrot cake and porridge i have ever eaten ! the price is cheap too ! The queue is quite long most of the times usually sold out around 1pm or early depend on the date. It is a must try !

In Singapore, if there is a long queue at a food stall which has a signboard that states only the stall's name and no photos of food items, go ahead and surprise yourself as it usually is worth the wait.Thong Kay Delights has been serving the same type of food for many years but the queue never ends as customers return daily to eat their fare.Peanut congee with every mouth filled with flavours from silverfish and peanuts, Yam or Radish Cake with sweet sauce and chilli sauce, Glutinous Rice with every bite worth of tiny morsel of added condiments, and the plain looking Chee Cheong Fun or Vermicelli Rice Cake packed with sesame seeds tastes simple but delicious with the sweet sauce and chilli sauce. Brings back memories of what good and unpretentious food should be
