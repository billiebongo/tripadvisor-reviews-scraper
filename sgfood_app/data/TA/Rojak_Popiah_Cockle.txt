The popiah skin was thin and the fillings were generous. Only other popiah I've had was at Takashimaya food court and compared to that, this one was better in the sense it was drier and not soggy when served. 2 pieces for sgd2.50, can't complain.

Extremely thick prawn paste for the rojak and generous toppings of peanuts. A must try at the hawker centre.

We lined up for about 15 mins and got to watch them wrap these goodies. Super tasty with hoisin sauce, peanuts, turnip, fried egg, beans sprouts, it is an amazing snack to finish off our lunch! Can't wait to come here again.

I consider them as local deserts. Something to add to the normal dishes. By the way, not much different from Malaysia style.

Been craving popiah for a while and happy to discover this place in Maxwell. However, the popiah was so so (quite tasty but too soggy) but really enjoyed the rojak! Even though I chose the small plate (S$3), the amount was generous.Will definitely be coming back
