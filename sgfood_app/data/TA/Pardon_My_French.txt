The owner is a young gentleman who puts a lot of effort into his cooking. Food is simple but tasty. Cosy environment.
I have dinners at Pardon My French many times and almost every week and standard is consistent.
Try this!

Charming little bistro with cosy decor and lovely little details, makes me feel like I am dining in someone's home.Had the Cordon Bleu pasta, French onion and mushroom pasta, duck confit, shoestring fries, beef stew and buttered rice.Cordon Bleu pasta came a creamy sauce with shreds of ham and grated Parmesan. The aromatic herbs hit your nose first and draws you in, and the creamy rich sauce dances on your tastebuds. Heavenly. We were so close to licking the plate.French onion and mushroom pasta, I've never quite tasted anything like it in SG. Shimeji and shitake (i think) mushrooms with fragrant bits of translucent onion in a broth sauce, so good I could eat it on it's own.The duck confit was the star of the show. Served with a simple, back-to-basics pumpkin puree and plum sauce, the duck meat is tasty and tender and easily pulled from the bone.Great value for money. And if you go there for lunch, there is an ongoing $7.90 lunch pasta special for the Cordon Bleu and French onion pasta
