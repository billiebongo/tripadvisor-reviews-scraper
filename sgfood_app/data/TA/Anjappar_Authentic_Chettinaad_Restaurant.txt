Hi this is mrs.shobana krishmadhi,
Last month im went to my honeymoon trip in singapore. We have mutton biryani @ anjappar restaurant in singapore. Wonderfull taste and very frndly services.
5
On our short 3-day trip to Singapore, we went to Anjappar twice for lunch. The place has great options for both veg and non-veg but this being a chettinad cuisine, it is quite spicy. The service is excellent especially Sathish who suggested us good food items for both veg and non-veg and also suggested places for visiting and shopping. Overall a good place for an Indian Chettinad meal and easily accessible by MRT (get down at Little India MRT and this is ~300 mts. walk)
5
We went to Anjapper with my family and friends for My friend son birthday .first the place was clean and good hygiene were maintained, they have more choice able menu variety (tandoori,south Indian and North Indian) .The food was very good and tasty feel like eat in my home town,also service was prompt.Good dinner thanks guys

I had regular south indian thali with a side of chicken 65. The food was very tasty and hygienic, Nice decor and warn atmosphere was attracted us. Thank you anjappar and well done ! Keep it your wonderful hospitality!
4
we tried at Singapore during our visit , i felt like my home cooking ... and the nice keep it up. also they can give some option to customer to choose spicy level it helps far better because some people like spicy or spicyless
3
Some of the dishes were disappointing - the dum biriyani lacked ‚Äúdum‚Äù and left us searching for the chicken after the first piece. Filter coffee and Chicken 65 were excellent.
4
We went last night to dinner in Anjappar .The food was delicious . We had veg thalis and mutton dish with beautiful Lime soda .Satish the waiter did every thing he could to help us and to refill our excellent meal . What a great Server .Thank you for a beautiful dinner experience ,We will be Back 
5
Dinner at Anjappar and the food was fantastic.Ordered the Anjappar Special Chicken and Podi Dosa. it was great. very tasty and service also very good.
5
our regular restaurant! we regularly go to anjappar for their briyani and egg kothu parotta & set dhosa is good
genuine chettinad food..good service & good variety of menu.
5
Really the food was delicious and very tasty .the service was very good.am always I like anjappar restaurant .. veg and non veg both extradinary taste.. always I will recommend this restaurant to my friends
4
The food was excellent, at a reasonable price with good service.
We had ordered Chicken Biryani and taste was authentic. Food quantity was good. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
3
Stopped off for an authentic Indian meal in Little India. Food was wide ranging and a good selection, and when it came, tasted good. The service was a little poor and not too friendly. Atmosphere got better as the night got later.
4
good food, Bt of expensive side. It's pretty old and has good reputation. Biryani isn't good here, Naan + Curry is best advised.
4
We have been to this restaurant twice and have enjoyed it . Food is delicious . Good selection of dishes .
They also deliver .
I would recommend this place .
5
This place was a great find for inexpensive and delicious Indian food. The flavours were incredible and the staff very friendly and professional. The kids loved the butter chicken in particular, but it was all great. We had a paneer, mutton, vegetable curry and other dishes and all were excellent
4
Anjappar is a brand... For a real authentic food.Had a chance to relish at various places since almost a decade... And must say... Taste is just greattttt... Everytime. And I really mean it... Every time.And their home delivery service add to the convenience of having authentic food at home comfort.Dine in option is equally good, with simple ambience and lovely people to serve you. It's my one of my favourite restaurant, especially being spice lover... Their varieties really tingles your taste buds and satisfy down to core...Only issue which can be improved is delivery time forecast... At times its not punctual.Though food cover it up all...A must try for food lovers
5
I've to say this for the team of Anjappar! You're really impressed us with wonderful hospitality, yummy food ÔøΩ and efficient service ! Definitely a good choice to dine in with your loved ones! They even help one of my friend whose on wheelchair. So I could say, this wheelchair friendly restaurant as well ! Thank you team and well done ÔøΩ! Keep it your wonderful hospitality
4
Went for Dinner on a Friday. Restaurant was decently crowded. Ordered Butter Naan with Gopi Manchurian and Veg Thali. Naan and Gopi was yummy.
3
Went in the afternoon with a few friends, most of the item in the menu wasn't available. The mutton briyani was so-so. For the price paid, I would recommend Sakuntala just down the road.
4
Pleasant environment good selection of vegetarian and meat and seafood dishes good service and large portions
5
Very tasty food but price is a bit high. Atmosphere is really good silent & peaceful. good to spent time.
4
Anjappar is never as crowded as its neighbouring establishments the food is equally good. I had the regular South Indian Thali with a side of chicken 65. The thali comes with two vegetables, three gravies, yougurt and pappadum. The chicken 65 was nothing to write home about but the rest was very good
4
Nice decor and warm atmosphere was what attracted us to this South Indian Chedttinadu restaurant. Food was pretty good all round and spicy just wasn't spicy enough for us locals. The thava fish fry was ordinary. The garlic and Kucha naans were great. The boneless mutton tika nice and full of basil and curry leaves. Mango lassi was overly strong and needed ice to dilute it down. Our Char tea was excellent. The briyani rice was lovely. The mutton bone soup was great and the Milaguthann was pretty good. We had to return the mutton soup as it's was served cold. Bill totals $66.50. Reasonable for valentines dinner!
1
Not sure if this is genuine Chenttinaad food but either way it really wasn't good. The 'mutton' masala was inedible. That was one big fat 'goat' with very little meat around its fat! Also, this was one of those curries that has loads of 'bits' in it. You have to pick your way to the very minimal meaty bits. The chicken was tough. The veggies were drowned in sauce. In fact, all the curries we had were drowned in sauce. I won't go back and I would not recommend. Many better options all around Little India and elsewhere - anywhere!
4
The main problem when most visit these restaurants is an expectation mismatch. Every one is keen that the taste matches the original Indian restaurant. This is an unfair expectation as there are various factors that impact the taste. Local ingredients, matching the taste to suit local palates etc.Anyways, I found it to be the next best if you are wanting Indian food and more so of the Chettinad variety. The other Chinese dishes were not upto the mark but the Chettinad stuff was decent.Tried both fish and chicken items and found them to be average and passable. Tone down your expectations and I guess it will be good
3
There is nothing to find fault with Anjappar food. But definitely the taste you get here and Chennai is very different. At any time, the Anjappar in Chennai outclass the ones here. Generally the food is about good to average. But portions can be smaller than what you pay for and the overall bill shocked me on both the occassions I went there. Still, once in a while when I have a craving got Anjappar food, I will still go there.
3
Many restaurants claim that they serve authentic chettinad cuisine but serve dishes that didn't originate from the chettinad cuisine. I'm glad that Anjappar decided to include a few authentic dishes in their menu to justify their name. The dishes include kozhi rasam ( chicken clear soup), nandu rasam ( crab soup) and uppu Kari. The rest of the dishes in the menu are not authentically chettinad (I am from chettinad). If you're keen on having authentic chettinad food, just try those dishes I have mentioned here
3
This South Indian restaurant is losing its original taste. Now becoming a regular north Indian restaurant.
5
Chettinaad traditional food very nice, spicy food, thava items and tandoori items so good. Good quality and good service, keep it up.
5
Awesome south indian chettinad cuisine.Loved everything and the seating was just right.Fantastic place
3
They started as a refreshing authentic Indian restaurant chain from India. Over time, they have also localised. I have been here many times with family and guest from overseas but the pull is come is less now. Today I had takeaway for the family with the usual fish fry, aloo gobi, palek paneer, roti and rice. They were not about to tone down the spiciness as I had requested
3
We visited the place for dinner, but were left disappointed. The food is nothing near the authentic and do not expect it to be also, but the taste left us very disappointed. The Veg Biryani was not spicy and looked very bland and the curry was a poor cousin of the ones you get in the same hotel in India. The ambiance is not great and the service average. Opt for options if available
2
Poor. Singaporrian version of Chenttinaad food. Ordered apam and Chicken Chenttinaad. The Apam was not Apam - just a flat pancake looking doughy thing and the Chicken Chenttinaad was just chicken curry with black pepper corns and loose/watery gravy. Local Indian colleagues said it is an authentic restaurant. I think my colleagues have been in Singapore too long and have forgotten how the authentic Chenttinaad food is in the Chennai area
4
The outlet at Race Course road have a party hall at first floor. I visit this restaurant regularly so I had organised my daughter's B'day party in Anjappar. The party hall is really good along with service provided. Guests enjoyed the food and ambiance.I would like to thank Anjappar staff and special thanks to Alagappan for making the party a memorable one.The food in this restaurant is authentic chettinad style and spicy as well
3
We went down to Little India to try out the cuisine. I guess I expected to find something "a little more authentic" in the Indian part of Singapore (and probably would have if I'd been much more adventurous) but ended up on Race Course Road walking along the string of curry houses. Anjappar was nice and clean. The staff were lovely and the service exceptionally fast. The food was all the basic staples of Indian cuisine, but it was tasty and plentiful. The Dahl was particularly good as was the Chettinad Goat (actually lamb!)Overall it wasn't necessarily a standout, but a decent enough place for a mainstream curry.
4
I patronize this restaurant approximately once every 2 months, and though I still rank it as one of my preferred Indian restaurants in the Little India area, I do feel that whilst the ambience has improved after the renovation, the food quality has fallen ever so slightly. The portions seem to have shrunk slightly as well, and the staff were a tad grouchy.Overall I would still rate this as a pleasant (though not excellent) dining experience.If the prices continue to inch upward and the portions shrink further, I would probably patronize this place less and less in future
5
Went as a couple of 2 adults. Ordered 1 dum mutton biryani, 1 country chicken dum briyani, fish tikka, 1 Gobi manchurian, 1 grape juice and 1 butter milk. Paid $53 in total.The overall 5 stars are for the country chicken dum briyani. The best along the street of race course road. Rich Flavours yet not heavily glazed with oil as I could feel the light fluff of the briyani rice. And the chicken was so tender and succulent, they made sure the meat was cooked thoroughly. I ordered the country chicken and it came with the chicken bone so some may not appreciate that.Grape juice tastes like it was literally squeezed pressed from grapes, not the canned/bottled kind, which some may not like. it's just a personal preference, I prefer canned grape juice but didn't mind it to be this fresh since I believe it'll be healthier.Clean shared hand wash area with a sink, towel dispenser and soap dispenser and individual male and female toilet cubicles at the side (much decent than other smaller restaurants in the area). Ambience was comfortable, brightly lit with refreshing wall Colours much like those photos shared here.I'll return for the briyani for sure. But definitely not the butter milk as I'm not used to a salty drink but my partner finished it
3
Be prepared to wait a long time espically on the weekends as there will be alot of people as it is next to mustafa centre. the food is decent tasting and nothing great to say about.
1
Anjappar known for its spicy foods.
But most of them are not available. And tried parota & kuruma. No taste at all. Kuruma has a sweetness.
Wasted my time & money in trying here.
4
Spicy Indian food served hot.I love the spice! Clear soups are excellent. Best place for non-vegeterians to soak their mouth in south indian chettinad food.
2
The restaurant was recommended by some Malayali friends of ours, who had visited last year. It seems that the place has gone downhill since then. Half the items in the menu were unavailable and the waiter informed us that they were "dinner" items. This includes Parotta. The food was nothing to write home about. The place is expensive and not worth the amount of money they are charging, given the mediocre fare they are serving
4
We went on the start of Dipawali. The food was good but not exceptional. We had gotten there early when the restaurant was almost empty. It got gradually more crowded. The service was informal and not very friendly or attentive. No big problem, just not welcoming. None of the food we tried seemed exceptional, but certainly acceptable
3
Well the food was spiceeeeeey! As one would expect! but I wouldn't call it flavoursome. It was hot but not the well-blended flavours one would expect from the proclaimed authenticity. Average (perhaps edging towards below average) probably does it. I did like the down to earth easy going ambiance. Hence the 3 stars. Would probably not venture here again if in Singapore simply due to the food not being so great. It has a nice down to earth character - almost rustic and charming. But that is not enough for a return visit I am afraid

On 6 June 2015, @ me and my friend ordered some dishes at the restaurant (Race Course Road). We were served the lollipops (chicken). Halfway through consumption, we realized that part of the chicken meat was uncooked and raw. We informed the captain and he was apologetic and offered to serve us other dishes. As we had already ordered other dishes (potato chicken, Deer Masala) we decided to carry on with the meal. Unfortunately as we had already ate part of the raw meat, the thought of having consumed raw chicken meat was too gross and thus we were unable to complete the meal. When we informed the staff present at the cashier, instead of being apologetic, the staff informed us that we could always inform the table captain and he would simply get it changed or get it cooked properly. I am disappointed by such a reply from a well known restaurant. She was neither apologetic nor understood the severity of serving raw meat. We are very disappointed at the service of the restaurant
1
I have been here few times with friends on treats. I find it as waste of money. Especially the one at jurong point.They do not cater fresh rather half boiled noodles, half cooked kadai veg, blunder masalas for chicken made me to keep looking for a better place than this and has found a lot around. The bience and staff are welcoming enough but the food is not.Waste of time and Money.The Only good thing is, it is located in one of the heart of jurong area and hemce the crowd. Better avoid it
3
Maybe when you come in with a lot of expectation even good turns out to be average. Having stayed away from eating Indian food in Hong Kong, we were really looking forward to this meal In Singapore. Taste could have been better. I mean spicier and more flavour. Service was quick but place can be much cleaner
4
A friend of mine brought me for dinner over the weekend. Him being indian, I left him to do the ordering of the food. He ordered the Chicken Lollypop, Chicken Manchurian, Tandoori Prawn and Mutton Briyani.The Chicken Lollypop is basically the chicken drumstick, but the meat pushed up to the top, looking like a Lollypop, hence the name. The spices were not too strong and the meat was juicy and succulent. I liked how the first bite makes you want to go for more.Chicken Manchurian not personally my favourite. Its chicken coated in flour and topped with sauce that wasn't spicy which would be good for those who can't really take spicy. Tandoori Prawn. Now this dish was perfect to my tastebuds. I loved this dish so much and it goes very well with the mint sauce provided together with it. Sadly, I feel that the prawns is a tad be small. Mutton Briyani was a medium size portion. Not as tasty and the mutton was in small cuts instead of chucks. There's a hard boiled egg hidden beneath the rice.Masala Tea that I ordered wasn't too strong with spices but a bit bitter too.Service is good. The waiters were attentive and was always close by
3
the food was not at all typical south indian spicy and i felt it was not worth paying that much for it.
4
Even when there was heavy rush, the food was excellent, at a reasonable price with good service. Only thing I had to do was smile a bit !
4
The food is definitely good as compared to other chettinad restaurants here, but not as great as authentic Chettinad restaurants. In terms of spice the chef seems to have toned down on it as compared to their Chennai outlets. Neverthless food and service were good . Not very steeply priced as well
4
When you think Indian food, it is always fiery hot and spices explosion. I love the spice but not the fire! Done with tennis at FArrer park so head over for dinner, friend from Uk introduced this place and I wasn't big on it. Ordered clear vegetable soup and the mix seafood noodles, low and behold, it is one of the best meal I ever had! The clear soup has so much taste in it and my mates all dig into it happily! Fried noodles is delicious, loads of vegetable, mutton and seafood! Very memorable. Give it shot ;
3
Established in Chennai in the year 1964, It has 40 years of experience and 25 outlets to date, It offers the typical Chettinad food from Southern India. Definitely the authentic Chettinad Food. One of my colleague and friend took me to this place in Little India. Had a lot of Indian food like Chicken Tikka, Biriyani, Kadhai Roast and its signature Mango Shake. One must try who wants to have a authentic Chettinad Cuisine.
3
I have been going to this place over the years and have always found the food to be good albeit more expensive than the cheaper places in LIttle India. I was surprised to see this time it had been totally renovated inside. It is a lot more modern now. No problem with that, but I did prefer the older style. HOWEVER, let's discuss the NAME of this place... "Authentic Chetinaad"... this food is uniquely from S. India especially Tamil Nadu. The menu now is about 75% North Indian... that is quite disappointing. The food we ordered was good, but really the change in menu is very disappointing. If you are looking for good S. Indian food... look elsewher

HiI have been there on long weekend in Sydney Anjappar after couple of friends recommended it but it was a nightmare and i wouldnt recommend anyone going there.Biggest disaster to the heights was when we ordered Chicken Biryani it had chicken drumsticks and couple of Goat/Lamb pieces in it too and were not even edible.Chicken Pakodi....Too Dry & Hard & Only 6 miniature pieces of chickenAchari Chicken...6 Average pieces but price highButter Naan...dough still chewyGinger chicken...Stinks and not sure what it was?Vegetable korma & Biryani....Veggies undercookedHighlight was when i asked the waiter about Fish dishes she gave the hint not to even try i.e she mean its NOT FRESH.Cheer

On feb 9 2014, around 2 pm called for lunch delivery to home . A lady who picked the phone, without even getting the order told it ll take 2 hrs for home delivery. Last month wen we ordered they delivered aft 3 hrs. When I asked abt it, she carelessly said ' if u want order or else don cal and kept the phone while talking' HOW RUDE?. Did she think herself CEO? I ve dined in Anjappar in chennai as well in sing. But customer service for home delivery is worst I can say. Please put a person who can politely talk to customers.

A long boring weekend in Singapore and nothing to do -- the answer to tedium, of course, is to go exploring. So my buddy and I hit Little India, and enjoyed the day mightily. The highlight might have been our delicious lunch at the Anjappar on Race Course Road. (There are several Anjappars in Singapore -- make sure you get the right one!)This modest restaurant looks like its been there a generation or two, with garish signage out front and a complete lack of parking anywhere. But hey, it's Singapore, so get used to it.Our host seated us promptly, whipped up an icy pitcher of beer and dropped of some home-made breads for snacking. We ordered a chicken dish, a deep-fried cauliflower dish and a bit of lamb, and all of them were delicious. Despite the lunchtime crowd there was no pressure for us to leave, so we ate and talked and drank some more beer and had quite a cordial afternoon. Our waiter came over and spoke to us about the restaurant, life in Little India, and some of the wacky travelers they get through the restaurant. All in all, a delightful day at a reasonable price -- about S$60 for the two of us. Not bad at all
4
I went with a friend (Indian) and we had a pitcher of beer and chicken pakoda as starters. It seemed to take a LONG time to get the beer to us. The chicken pakoda was OK but a bit too oily and too many pieces of just fried dough rather than chicken bits. Good tasting, but could have been better prepared. Our main dishes were mutton masala (average), palak paneer (good), and special anjappar chicken dry (excellent). The food came much too quickly ... we had barely started our appetizers and beer and they brought the mains. The place was crowded as it was a Saturday night. And of course the waiter did the annoying thing of asking my friend in Tamil after he and I ordered in English if he was SURE he didn't want anything else. It seems like ordering in English is somehow "not real". It is not the BEST Indian in Singapore, but it is acceptable if you choose the right dishes
