I ordered the seafood olio and it was not bad. However, full marks for their waffles with ice cream on top. You can choose from their selection of interesting flavours. Service was average.

The decor might not be much and food is decent.
But the waffles are definitely worth trying and going for more. Tasty and crispy, perfect with large selection of ice cream and home-made sauces.
My go to place for waffles.

It's a hidden gem in the east and I love their waffles especially! They are usually closed on Monday and operate till pretty late over weekend,

We tried the smoked duck aglio ($13.90) and seafood aglio ($14.90). We asked for less garlic and less oil (being health conscious). The pasta came in an appropriate serving, with the smoked duck going well with the pasta. The amount of chilli added was suitable, without being overly spicy. The seafood was kind of little, with only two prawns and two pieces of squid to go with the whole bowl of pasta. Nevertheless, the tasty pasta made up for it. The linguine used for the pasta reminds me of eating "mee pok" (flat Chinese noodles that go well with minced meat)

This is a neighbourhood cafe. Cakes are really great and price is decent. Read up about their customised cakes and find that the price is reasonable given the looks and taste of it. Don't miss their ice cream especially the Earl Grey ice cream. Those who love alcohol should try their rum and raisin

My friend and I were browsing through the internet to find the nearest cafe in our location, which is in Bedok. We found several cafes and chose D'zerts Cafe as it was the nearest. The cafe was situated in 30 Jalan Pari Burong. The location was quite convenient. Few food shops and restaurants were in the same row as D'zerts Cafe. Diners have option to choose which place to dine.D'zerts cafe was a simple cafe with variety of homemade desserts choices, from handcrafted homemade cakes to style your own waffles. They offer main course too such as salad, pasta and poultry meat. Cafe's environment was "okay", simple and quite. Those diners who want to have personal space, this cafe is suitable for them. Staffs were a little bit reserved. They were quite slow and not so attentive compared to other cafes' staffs. They didn't even tell us straight away that we need to place our order at the counter. If I didn't asked for the menu, we wouldn't know that we need to place our order at the counter. However, even if the staffs were quite reserved, they were nice and shared a smile to us while ordering, and serving our orders.My friend and I ordered:-Squid ink pasta (the staff recommended this): It was nice. The pasta cook perfectly and the squid ink aroma was amazing.-Style your own waffle w/2 scoops of ice cream (dark chocolate and caramel): The waffle was quite crispy and it blended well with the ice cream.-Assorted homemade macaroons (5 pcs.): Purposely bought these to decorate the waffle. The macaroons were not bad. It tasted good.-Chocolate banana mousse cake (w/minion design): It was good too. However, I have only tasted the banana mousse. My friend and I were finding the chocolate but we only found a quarter of an index finger sized chocolate inside the cake-Cafe latte: Nothing to brag about this latte. It was normal-Mochaccino: My friend ordered this. She said it was not that badThis cafe is suitable for those who want to have a quite place to dine. If you are around Bedok area, you could visit this cafe and try their handcrafted homemade desserts

Over the weekend, we visited D'zerts Cafe, a quaint little desserts cafe located in Simpang Bedok / Changi area. Seats were bright red, so it gave off a cheery feel.We were served their signature Waffles and Ice-cream (SGD$10.90). The waffles were shades of a healthy golden-brown, crispy on the exterior, and fluffy on the inside. The huge scoops of ice-cream were delightful - we shared and tried everything basically. The better ones were peanut butter, earl grey, salted caramel and chocolate mint. The matcha and black sesame ones were a little light - probably because we were comparing them to the traditional Japanese ones with thicker flavours.We also tried the Salted Caramel Cheesecake (SGD$6.00) that consisted of a good balance in its light flavours of savoury-sweet combo. The cottony-soft texture was well balanced by a piece of (biscuit) crisp in between the layers, giving the cake some crunch.The Matcha Latte Cake (SGD$5.00) had a good blend of green tea's taste complemented by the stronger jolt of milky-coffee layers; forming a lovely union of deliciousness that melted lusciously in the mouth.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to refer to:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/07/invited-tasting-by-makanjoy-lunch-at.htm

Ate here several times because of convenient parking and prompt service.However last visit was 18 Jan 2015 and have never been back since.Ordered spaghetti aglio olio at 1739hrs.Food finally arrived 1815hrs.Was only told that the kitchen had to make a fresh batch of pasta AFTER I had paid for the food.Very disappointed with such poor coordination.Posted a review on their FaceBook page - their response was basically - too bad, this is how we do things.1st mistake: running out of pasta.2nd mistake: poor handling of situation - no apology no options offered just shut up, sit down and wait.3rd mistake: lying repeatedly about when the food would come4th mistake: when feedback given - handled the same way when they ran out of pasta - mere acknowledgement of mistake, response - well this is how we do things, no apology offered just shut up and donâ€™t come back

Set in a nearby neighbourhood and within walking distance of where I live and having heard good about whats there on offer, we decided to go there. After having been there a few times, for both casual and formal meetups, all I can say is that just go and order whatever you fancy and you shall not be disappointed. They have a large selection of mouth watering desserts and the famous waffles that go well with the hand-crafted beverages.Nothing fancy in terms of the place which makes it less pretentious vis a vis its competitors in some fancy areas of the island. Maybe that is what gives the place a cosy feel and a family hangout vibe
