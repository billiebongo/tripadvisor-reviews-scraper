The slow boiled collagen pork broth is outstanding. Donâ€™t miss it. I had option #1 on the menu and it was soooo rich and flavorful.

You can never go wrong with their fantastic and rich tonkotsu broth - the best of its kind in Singapore! They have interesting variations too like black broth, bonito, which makes return visits worthwhile

Their special tonkotsu is a must try. Free flow of hard oil eggs. Free flow of ice water (where most restaurant in Singapore charge for a cup of ice water!) ... can be crowded during evening meal hours.

A second visit within a month. There is always a queue at dinner time but average waiting time is within 10 minutes. Atmosphere is rara, service is brisk & courteous. Seating wise is tight & alittle warm so that's a minus.Both occasions, we ordered the standard tonkotsu ramen with flavoured egg. The broth is silky smooth & flavourful, does not have a porky smell or leave a porky aftertaste in the palate. The ramen is cooked to desired firmness & stays this way to the last bite. The flavoured egg is done to perfection with an orange creamy yolk, tender & delicate egg white. Crunchy bits of black fungus adds a healthy dimension to the treat. Food was consistent on both visits.Overall, this is one of the better tonkotsu based ramen in Singapore.

Hakata Ikkousha is a well known ramen chain from Japan, which started in 2004 at Hakata, Fukuoka, Japan. After holding the reigns for Singapore's Ultimate Ramen Champion for 2 years, it opened its first stand alone outlet in Singapore in Tanjong Pagar, which was soon followed by another outlet in Chijmes. The tanjong pagar outlet was located in HDB block.Tonkotsu Standard Ramen (S$12++)Full-bodied and collagen-rich pork bone soup, served with the thin noodles, tender pork cha-shu, fungus and spring onions.One could select the texture of the noodle and the saltiness of the soup.The soup was rich and creamy without being too salty. The noodle was cooked just nice without without too hard or soft. The shredded fungus added a touch of crunchy texture to the dish.Accompanied the dish with pickled ginger and pickled mustard provided, which peaked up the taste of the rich and creamy soup base.There was also other condiments and free flow hard boiled eggs to help one self to.As for me, I like to add freshly grounded sesame seeds to the ramen which gave it a nutty taste on top of the rich creamy soup.One could also topup S$4++ for special topping which includes a flavoured egg and 3 more pieces of chashu. The flavoured egg was soft inside with lava like yolk, and did not taste too salty.There was also other toppings such as vegetables, seaweed, bamboo shoots.Besides ramen, there was also side dishes in the menu.Special Fried Chicken (S$5++)It was served with flavoured salt. The chicken was tender and juicy.Overall food was not bad, with lots of condiments and ice water to help oneself to. Staffs were friendly and cleared the cutlery swiftly

Together with a friend, I ordered the tonkotsu ramen special and a side order of their famed gyoza. We had to wait at least 5 mins but the wait was worth it. Awesome ramen! And equally good gyoza. The ramen has a rich flavorful broth, matched with soft thinly sliced pork, al dente noodles, seaweed and soft boiled eggs.Though small in size, I enjoyed the gyozas especially with the accompanying sauce. Add a dash of chili to spice it up a bit. Overall, truly satisfying ramen meal. Be careful in filling out the order slip. I ended up having 2 eggs because I overlooked the fine print. Will definitely be back here.

This is mine and my other half's favourite Ramen place in Singapore.He's a really picky eater and very particular about how a food tastes and its quality. He has blacklisted several ramen places across the island, but not this one.The soup is really tasty, especially the original and the black one, both of which we love. The free flow of hard boiled eggs is definitely a bonus. We visit this place quite regularly despite his complains of parking difficulties in this area

Was craving for Ichiran ramen unfortunately I'm in the wrong country haha! The was my first time having ramen in SG unfortunately didn't satisfy my craving as it wasn't as flavoursome as ramen's I've had in Japan... left with a food coma but unsatisfied tastebuds. 5/5 for Serving size & service though so I won't be mean and rate on TA lower...

Ambience: 4.5/5Quality of Service: 4/5Cleanliness: 5/5Quality of Food: 5/5Value for Money: 4.5/5The OrderGodfire Level 1 4.5/5The Good: Excellent cozy Japanese atmosphere with warm original Japanese music! Loved the Ramen, spicy, but not too much, soup is flavourful, they offer free flow of eggs, and radishes that are awesomely nice!!! Overall it's excellent, we just have to be mindful that during peak periods it might be squeezy.The Bad: Customer service is average, but otherwise overall a very brilliant experience! Bottomline: Restaurant have won several accolades online, can try this one out, it might turn out to be one of the best Ramens in Singapore!

Not a big establishment but have some pretty good ramen. Tried the Chilli God level 2 spiciness. it was Awesome. Not sure what would level 4 be. Eggs are unlimited to those who have big appetite. Downside is that its not too big in accommodating huge crowds. Other than that, no complains

Really enjoyed all the soups I've had here and the pork has been absolutely delicious. The endless supply of hard boiled eggs for your broth along with pickled ginger (I love pickled ginger) is great! Fried chicken and gyoza were tasty too. Can't recommend enough.

Decided to try it when we're Super hungry! It's a good decision!We ordered the original and bonito ramen. The saltiness is just right for me but it may be a bit saltier for my friends Hard boiled egg and water is free flow. Quite a good deal! Gyoza is also delicious

Tanjong pagar has become somewhat of a Tokyotown/ Koreatown with the proliferation of ramen shops, Korean bbq restaurants, Korean fried chicken eateries and gyoza/ chirashi/ tempura eateries. Despite the number of very good restaurants here, Hakata Ikkousha still holds its own. Ramen broth here is flavorful, the ramen has the right texture and the stewed egg has a wonderful semi runny yolk. They had a promo today which have 50% off for a certain ramen on their menu, to subscribers of a mobile app. Very good value!

One of the best ramen i had outside Japan. Delicious frothy soup with noodle of just the right texture. Their gyoza is also nice as a side dish, not so oily and really flavorful. The only downside is that the price is not exactly cheap, due you have to add-ons ingredients like seaweed, etc. Overall really love their ramen

We visited on a very busy Saturday night. It appears a very popular ramen restaurant.Even though there was a queue outside, we were able to get seated promptly as there were only 2 of us. The service was good and very quick. The food arrived quicklyWe ordered the Gyozas, and the Special Tonkotsu and the Soy Sauce ramen. Both were full of flavor and filling.Would definitely eat there again if in town

If you've previously dined here and were surprised at the range of free giveaways and special offers, you'll find that service has ... move on a bit since then.That said, you will still find a queue snaking out of the shop sometimes, for the ramen is still made well.Ikkousha is located at a residential area, and it has a branch at Chijmes

If you love ramen and is looking for authentic Japanese ramen, you should really try this one. If you're there for the first time, try their signature Tonkotsu Ramen. The soup broth is really rich. They offer freeflow of hard-boiled eggs as well.P/S: There will always be a long queue especially during the peak hours like lunch and dinner. Don't be deterred to try this good bowl of ramen because of the queue. It doesn't take very long. The customers usually leave almost immediately upon finishing their food

In Singapore many of Japanese ramenshops are "Sinagporalized" in good and bad both meaning - however, this one is really reprodicng the taste of hakata ra-men in japan. I have 100000% confedeince of recommending this ramen in case if you are in Sg and want to taste the real Japanese Tonkotsu ramen

Visited this place for lunch this week. Arriving at around 12pm there was no queue and we were able to get seats without difficulty. I opted for the black ramen which was decent. Boiled eggs are available on the table together with the usual ramen sauces and spices. The gyoza was pretty good too

I love Hakata Ramen!! But there were no real Hakata Ramen before this restaurant opened. I really glad to visit there and eat the Hakata Ramen.Hakata Ramen contains thick pork soup and fine noodles, and best topping is red colored shredded ginger pickles. In Hakata, the soup should be served at very hot and noodles mustn't boil long, a bit hard noodle is real Hakata style. This restaurant reproduces these original style. This restaurant is the best choice for a Ramen freak
