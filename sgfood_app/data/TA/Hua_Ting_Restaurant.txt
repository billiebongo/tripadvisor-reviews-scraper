Restaurant serves Chinese cuisine in a fine-dining ambience which specifies:
Attire: Smart Casual but most guests were casually dressed, even in slippers.
Food is average. Service is slow due to insufficient resources
5
The food is quite expensive, but super nice. Even the vegetarian set dinner is awesome. The only thing is the waiter is not paying attention and keep forgot what we asked.
2
This restaurant is relatively up market (dress code, pricing etc.), however the dining experience is anything but. Whilst the food was ok, the service aspect was a real let down. There was nobody at the entry to welcome guests. It took 40 minutes to get the first drink, and then a second drink did not materialise at all. The food order was taken incorrectly (due to English language difficulties), resulting in too much food being delivered. I would suggest caution if considering this restaurant, at least until the service aspect has been dealt with by management - the night I was there is was not good, with staff clearly under a lot of pressure for some reason.

Went to Hua Ting for a special meal with visiting friends. Were put in a private room, which was great since we had 2 babies and 1 young child in tow, but it was quite cramped. Decor was nice. Food was excellent, but service was inconsistent. Seems to be a theme in a few of the reviews -- this restaurant would be outstanding if service quality improved. Not sure I'd return unless service improves given all the dim sum options in Singapore
2
Standard of good is always nice at Hua Ting but when we visited this time there were few areas to improve:1. Screw inside my drinking water2. Short of manpower perhaps as staffs are too busy to notice when we needed help and we waited 20 mins in between our dishes
5
They‚Äôve revamp the restaurant layout with more pte dinning rooms (4 pax to 20 pax), even the main dinning hall has small alcove n a good view of the orchard road.The food is as good as before. The ‚Äúacid test‚Äù for me is the char Siew bao....where the dough is soft/fluffy but don‚Äôt stick to ones gum, and the char Siew is moist n not overly sweet..... Passes the test!Other dishes, stir fry veg, hor fun in claypot comes with wonderful wok-hei Adds to that, very attentive service where the tea were topped up regularly n plates cleared!And a nice touch to the environment,...no table cloth! Save the environmental hazards to launder these

Wanted to try this restaurant after the renovation. Food was very interesting and good. We had the herbal chicken that came wrapped in dough and shaped like a chicken. Presentation and taste were really good! Service was very good too! Only problem was charging $3.50 for water
3
The food was not too bad and the service was good. When we asked for warm water, we were told there would be charges, which was acceptable to us since it is a common practice. What we didn't expect was the glass of warm water cost us $3.50 ! We were given an appetizer which we did not order so we thought it was complimentary but we were actually charged for it. Ambience is good but I guess you pay for it
5
We ate at few very good restaurants in Singapore , but as far as Dim Sum are concerned Hua Ting is by far the best there is. Very original, fresh and even surprising dishes, perfectly executed. We went back twice and we'll definitely go back again.Service is worth 3 Michelin stars restaurant : professional, discreet and very efficient.Very good choice of vines, excellent teas and very original deserts menu

Excellent Cantonese food which is exquisitely prepared using freshest ingredients. Will come here again.
5
Nice restaurant. Always jam and packed. Always waiting line. I like the soup base for hot pot. So tasty. Recommended.
5
A local Singaporean friend wanted to treat my friends and I to a high end Cantonese meal and she chose Hua Ting at the Orchard Hotel. The dining room is formal, yet comfortable, the staff professional yet courteous and the food top notch if expensive.
5
We recently visited with friends when visiting Singapore from Australia. Our friends (who are from Singapore) booked this restaurant and pre ordered a Peking duck. Food was sensational and reasonably priced. Overall a lovely dining experience.
4
The meal was nice, although expensive. Well presented with great service by friendly staff. Recommend for Dinner
5
This restaurant has undergone a major renovation, which includes a new menu.The food was really very, very good as was the service. And the prices were more than reasonable.A must try is the Peking duck. Exceptionally good. As was the Wagyu beef. Superb.This place is a true hidden gem in Singapore and I'm surprised that I haven't seen it advertised.This is a definite "must return to" kind of place
5
We visited this restaurant on 9 Dec and were impressed both by the food and it's services here.Right at the entrance, we saw our familiar face Lynn who gave us a warmth welcome and directed us to our table. Together with Aries, they introduced their newly renovated setup and rooms to us, which we can feel their pride and joy as they do so.At our table, we were well taken care of by Andy, Marilyn and David. As our boy was sick and feeling cold, the ladies helped to source for a cardigan to keep him warmth. They seemed more like butlers attending to us, paying attention to finer details on the quality of food, as well as the condition of our boy.Food was both fantastic and awesome! I love their wide variety of dim sum, as well as traditional dishes like Peking Ducks, Roast Ducks, and seafood dishes with shark fin soups, sea urchins, etc.To put it simply , it was so good that we were already planning for our next trip here even before we were done with our lunch!Personally, there are always places that we must try at least once but there are only a few that we have the desire to return again. Hua Ting is certainly one them
5
The Hua Ting has just completed a major renovation, staff, decor and food. We were invited as "test subjects" to sample and critique the restaurant. The food was nothing short of spectacular! I made a passing remark on one dish and it was immediately noted by the G.M., Ms Sim. The staff and service were first class, nothing missed their attention. What truly amazed me was the prices on the menu. Appetizers from (all $ Singapore) $10, Mains from $20 - $35 and deserts from $6. I defy anyone to dine in a first class restaurant in Singapore for this amount. Wines (as usual in Singapore) were on the expensive side.Great job Orchard Hotel.(Disclaimer: The Orchard Hotel provided dinner

Food quality goodAmbience goodMenu not clear, staff cannot explain what they are offering.Not a single English speaking person in the restaurant We did not know what to order but finally did and food was good but if we knew the menu better we could have ordered some varieties
1
Brought my mum for lunch with reservations.Was told over the phone that we can't dress Bermuda or too casual .We were given a seat near the entrance despite asking to as change . The lady who waits on us told us that the restaurant is running full house.Well, we have to take what is available because we did not emphasis our preference initially.Food were served not long after ordering . Instead of serving the "right temperature" we got a slightly above warm food. As we were discussing on the food , a couple walked in with the guy in Bermudas and flips . I have him the benefit of ignorance because he's a foreigner but I was skeptical in the double standard raised by the hotel.Nevertheless , the bill from the restaurant was not that expensive, prices were normal as compared to the same range of category.But , not my style or just not my day, no matter how others have rated this restaurant highly .

The roasted duck was so damn delicious..
The skin was crispy and the meat so juicy, tender with great aroma. Must try! Definitely will come back to this üëå
4
A large group for business dinner and we had 8 courses - each course was presented well and tasted good without anything standing out.
Service and decor was Ok but a number of times we had long delays and confusion in what was coming next
3
I have been to this restaurant a few times and comments from my group differs.
I feel that the food here is decent. Above average, but still a notch below other restaurants in Orchard road areas.
5
If you are looking for a good Chinese Cantonese restaurant at Orchard road or simply staying at Orchard Hotel, look no further as you will not go wrong with this choice! Peking duck was excellent and you can request for the duck meat to be sliced and cooked further with noodles as a dish too. Other seafood, meat and soup items were equally excellent! Service is also very attentive, albeit slow, however this is fine dining, so you should plan sufficient time for a great meal and should not be rushed! :-) Even in large group, they can divide the shared dishes into individual plates. Dessert choices are equally good!
5
My family visits this restaurant regularly. There's a variety of Chinese dishes available, from dimsum on lunch menu to peking duck and other signature dishes for dinner. The food is exquisite and you can ask the friendly service staff to recommend if you can't decide. We have a good dining experience thanks to Moon, a very pleasant lady who always make us feel welcomed. Overall a Chinese restaurant I would recommend to others
3
We chose this restaurant to celebrate Mother's Day based on recommendations and its reputation that we heard so much about.However, the taste disappointed us and was not like what others raved about.Other than the wrapped Peking duck skin, the rest of the dishes were below par. The duck meat that was used to cook into little meat cubes to be wrapped with lettuce and eaten was too sweet and hard - it was overcooked.The salted egg fish skin was average although the skin was still crispy. Would be better without the salted egg sauce.The Xiao Long bao was a let down. Instead of a broth inside it, it contained a sauce that was too salty. One of its signature dishes, the Hua Ting Signature Baked Chicken Tarlets with mango was not that fantastic and too sweet.As for the dessert, which was osmanthus jelly, two were served but they were very small - not worth the money.Also, we were seated close to the table where the staff used to prepare the servings for diners and we could see that the staff were struggling to complete serving all the orders promptly. There were some near heated exchanges among them on where to serve what dishes.On the other hand, the service provided by the male supervisor was good and always gave a smile.Overall, we would not return because it seems that the quality has dropped and not worth the price
5
Dine in yesterday dinner with family. Love the crab claw with black pepper, venison cubes, and dessert almond cream. Big thank you to Moon, a knowledgeable and nice lady who recommend such good food for my family...my old nanny like those food especially! Will definitely come back again
5
True story in the headline. Service is above excellent. I was with a group of 7 and we ordered a lot off the menu and it was all great. I highly recommend the crab with black pepper sauce - they'll give you blue gloves to not mess your hands! We were the only western table in the place and enjoyed all of our meal. Excellent

@TheKuoKnowsHua Ting is reckoned to be one of Singapore's top Cantonese restaurants. It is certainly up there with some of the best.Its signature Roast Duck is arguably one of the most outstanding in the Garden City. It is succulent on the inside and crispy on the outside. Quite exquisite.If the duck is succulent, then the Kurobuta Pork is - in the words of Willy Wonka - scrumdiddlyumptious. It tickles the taste buds, melts in the mouth and has you returning for more.I set the chef a task of making something that was not available on the menu - Fried Noodles with Pickled Vegetables, Green Capsicum and Shredded Beef. He rose to the challenge and served up and excellent plate of food.There is an excellent choice of desserts on offer. I highly recommend giving the Red Bean Soup a try. It rounds off the meal excellently.Hua Ting is a winner, for me. Lunch times can be a bit hectic. So too can dinner time. Do consider booking ahead

Granted it was a Chinese New Year lunch and it was packed. However, the service was not up to par. Wrong dishes were brought to my table and they wanted to take it back after we already dug in until I offered to pay extra. Food standards are not what they used to be. Really unfortunate.
4
The shark's bone soup with fish paste noodles and Peking duck here are out of this world... simply divine! üëçüèºüòç other dishes like prawns coated with wasabi or salted egg yolk and spinach tofu are nice, as well as their dim sum.
5
Had an 8 course Chinese lunch with friends. The food is great. The service is good. We were given a private room, and 2 waitresses diligently served us.
4
There is a decent variety of tasty dim sum for lunch and the other offerings on the menu are also good. Among the dishes I order frequently are the steamed prawns (very fresh and cooked just right) and the Peking duck.
5
After many years from previous visit, had dinner at Hua Ting last night. Food is as good as ever but a pleasant surprise of now serving fine dining style. Perennial favourite starter of mixed Roast Duck / Crispy Pork followed by steamed Garoupa , Spinach & pan seared Lamb Chop went very well with Penfold's Shiraz. Service was good , timely & well presented. All dishes were delicious as well as fulfilling. Well done 
5
Classic and high quality but not quite 'traditional' Cantonese cuisine.Simply fine chinese cooking in a fine comfortable chinese restaurant.This is not 'new world' cooking but carefully prepared and presented excellent dining.We tried lots of dishes and all were really good (the fish, crab and desert exceptionally so!)It's possible to dine here at a great range of price options (inexpensive appetisers and dim sum to hugely expensive abalone and crab) - its your choice - but not overpriced in my view.Every member of staff (all female on this occasion - I don't know if that's usual) were smiling, friendly, attentive and helpful.The restaurant is furnished and decorated in a very comfortable and classic way.The air conditioning was too cool for our liking but I guess adjusted to better suit busy family 'Dim Sum' diners.A great dinner this
3
Noticed that the food standard is not as great anymore! The Peking Duck was very much smaller than expected. They might have used a duckling! The meat that was served separately was not as juicy as it used to be.The tim sum was not great anymore! Maybe it was the Chef's off day on Sunday

I went to this restaurant hoping for a tasty and relaxing meal. I got there and was told they dont open until 6:30pm and to come back. On my way out, I look at my watch and it was 6:28. Really? 2 minutes early and they wont seat me? So I come back and get seated and, unasked for, they bring an amuse bouche to my table, so I eat it. More on that later. Then I order some soup and the "rack of lamb." So the lamb comes and it is one skinny as hell lamb chop that was half inedible fat. Everywhere I have ever been a rack of lamb is at least four to six chops. Otherwise it is a lamb chop and it still wouldn't be as tiny as what I got. I complain about the false advertising, but they don't give a damn.Next comes the bill. Not only do they charge me extra for rice and tea, but they had the nerve to charge me for the amuse bouche. Unheard of to bring something to your table before you order, not advise you that there is a charge for it, and then put an extra four dollars on your bill for it. They did finally remove it from my bill, but not until I had to argue with two different staff. Ridiculous. Avoid this ripoff joint at all costs

This is a popular local Chinese restaurant which serves good Cantonese cuisine.Its set menu can be particularly fusion.We had a private room for two tables of ten. Every dish was excellent. Entree was crispy roast pork, jelllyfish and scallop. Lobster in spinach cream soup was excellent. Abalone with shiitake mushroom and greens was healthy. Sea perch with yanagi matsutake and green was moist inside and crispy outside. Duck with light stringy noodle was great. Red bean soup was fragrant with lily bulb and preserved tangerine peel, and Chinese petit fours
5
i only tried hua ting's dim sum to be fair their dim sum are fantastic and at reasonable pricingsiew mai and har gau prawn are juicy and freshroast pork is crispy and tasty and juicythough the variety of the dim sum is not alot but you not get bored over it even if u repeat the ordermajortiy of the staff are polite and helpful ( do encounter one staff that is not too friendly) but overall the staff does not affect my appetite and enjoyment over hua tinghave even brought my oversea friends for a taste of it and is was almost perfect for their taste i strongly recommend if you have not tried ans are looking for nice dim sum in singaporeremember to call and make a reservation in order not to be disappointe

I've been trying to find a dim sum place that is comparable to the sort of experience I had in New York: About 8 friends, stuffed, trying to force the last pork bun on one another because no one wants to leave food behind. Hua Ting is not that sort of place. The plate selection was atypical, aiming to be a bit more elegant I think. This is not necessarily bad. But they failed to hit the mark. The more complicated flavors failed to fully come through. In the end, it was neither a good greasy spoon dim sum place nor a good elegant dining experience. The service was atrocious. We had to ask repeatedly for the same thing (like water, tea, ginger, the menu). The restaurant was half empty so there was no excuse. The waiters' uniforms were so old and worn they were threadbare at the waist level. The prices were decent though. We three ate well for about 75$ (with a 20% discount for OCBC, this became even less). But I'm not sure I'd come back for that reason.
5
Well known Cantonese restaurant for years and years - just can't go wrong ! Dim sum; good soup and Chinese food. Spacious atmosphere.
5
Ate here with two Chinese friends who ordered us all one of the set meals. Very elegant dining ,wonderful service. Food was beautifully presented and tasty, even if I didn't always know what I was eating !
3
This is more a Singapore restaurant than an authentic Cantonese restaurant. Dishes were uneven - mushroom and vegetable dishes were ok whereas venison, shark fin soup and other meat dishes were mediocre. I expected much better for the price.
3
Very very good taarlet ! Crispy. Tasteful. And soft. I wish they have bbq pork filling. Although the chicken n mango is quite interesting too... Definition will go back for the taarlet.

This ranks as one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Singapore -- simply because of the quality of food, ambience and good service.Set in Orchard Hotel, Hua Ting requires advanced booking for a place for lunch and dinner. Don't expect to walk-in and find an available table, except when it's after the lunch or dinner peak, and you don't mind eating late.Equally good for lunch and dinner, my favourites here are the Golden Melon Seafood soup which is served within the melon itself, hollowed out to form a receptacle for the delicious seafood soup, filled chock-a-block with goodies like diced prawns, scallops and so on. The best thing is that you can scrape the inside of the melon and eat it even as you drink the soup :)The other thing I really like is the Peking Duck, served with flour skin wraps (unlike some places which use crepe skins). They do a great 2nd serving of the dish by cooking the duck meat in shreds in beehoon (rice vermicelli), mixing it with some preserved vegetables and sauce. Alternatively, you could always ask them to slice the duck meat for you. Their Roasted Pork is also stunning -- the thin, crispy skin is crackling good and the meat under is so tender and juicy... served with a yellow mustard dip, it makes a tantalising appetizer. If you're there for lunch, do try their dim sum as well. A real challenge for dim sum places is the "har gao" which is the prawn dumpling -- some places tend to do the skin a tad too thick and it gets gooey or too hard depending on the amount of steam or exposure to the room... So far, I'm pretty happy with their har gao, the skin is of the right texture and thickness. (But as a general rule, when eating har gao, it's always good to not leave it exposed for too long, same goes with xiao long baos).They serve the staples in any Chinese restaurant, as well as have some pretty interesting creations which showcase the chefs' invention in making modern Chinese cuisine. So don't be surprised if you're handed a fork and knife for some dishes.The restaurant is upper-mid range and caters to all groups of people be they there for leisure, celebration or work meals. They do have private function rooms within the restaurant itself but these will need to be specially booked, and a minimum spend must be met. Whilst generally 'quiet' as people don't talk too loudly, be prepared for some occasional screaming kids as this place does cater to families as well (but this is not so much the fault of the restaurant than the parents who do not attempt to manage their children).Decked in warm hues of cream, wood and red, the decor doesn't scream Chinese restaurant but is tasteful and nuanced enough to convey modern Chinois. Well-staffed, the service is prompt, friendly and efficient. Do check with the Captains if you need a recommendation and they'd also be able to advise if you've ordered enough food for your party. I like their Tie Guanyin tea and Pu-er tea. If you like something more delicate, then go for the Jasmine tea or Tie Guanyin. Pu-er is an acquired taste
3
I find the place pretty boring and blend even though the food is competent. Some people swear by this place but I don't see the fascination. Nevertheless if I were in this area or staying at this hotel, I would come for dim sum lunch but I won't make a special trip to visit here for food
3
Went for dim sum; decided to order soft-shell crab wrapped in rice wrap; it was quite disappointing as the crab was not fresh and tasted a little fishy. The only menu that I thought was great is the custard bun. Everything is expensive. Definitely not coming back
5
I chose Hua Ting for a business lunch and it did not disappoint. My guest explained the test of a good Chinese restaurant is the way they steam vegetables and steam fish. Hua Ting nails both.The food is excellent, the service attentive and it is possible to have a conversation. While the restaurant is large, it is well designed so as not to be too noisy
4
Quality of the food was good. The herbs were very strong in flavour but not too overpowering. The selection of chinese dishes were plenty and all of the dishes that I have ordered were faultless. Service may be a tad bit slow but with a high number of diners, it is forgivable. Overall, not a bad place to have dinner. Would definitely come back again when I can
2
My family of 6 came here for dinner. We ordered 6 dishes and the food came very slowly, one dish at a time and the last dish, a 1 kg steamed Soon Hock took forever even though we asked the waitress and she said it would be ready in 5 mins but it never came bacause the kitchen made a mistake and served the fish to another table. In the end we had to cancel that particular order. The roasted chicken tasted very bland, I had to dip it in soy sauce. The rest of the dishes were eatable, thankfully. We decided to skip desserts after the unpleasant incident earlier.
1
food average, can cook better at home
ordered a steamed fish, after 1 hour and repeated requests to check on order, they finally told us they had mixed up the order and have not cooked the fish.
4
We come here for dim sum lunch. Love their signature pies, seafood fruit spring roll. Their seafood noodle also taste not bad even though quite oily.
Service not bad.
1
The staff aren't able to cope with a phone in pre-order for one dish to be picked up at a pre-fixed time. They find it tough to deal politely and efficiently with anyone walking through the door. Not worth the bother.
4
I was invited for a busness dinner and despite the restaurant was quite full, the service was impeccable, with no black outs, in a confortable room where all talbes were taken moreover it was no noisy so easy to speak and to discuss. The food was really nice and good, regretfully I dont know the names of the vairous dishes prsented (8) so sorry!Just pop in and try. You will not be disappointed
4
Haven't been here in years because the service was haphazard at best. They had forgotten to serve dishes before which can be quite embarrassing if you are entertaining. So despite the Ala Carte discount card that gives very good discount, I decided not to patronise this restaurant again.Here only because it is a reunion lunch Organised by an ex-colleague.Service was okay as we were in a room and a Long time senior waitress took our order.Appetiser - fried fish. Looked like fried carrot cake.Yu Sheng - good.Abalone soup - good.Suckling pig was huge. The skin was good and the meat fried with salt & pepper was excellent; best that I've had.Huge steamed batang fish - some of us liked it but not me.Mixed vegetables with my Favourite lily bulb- nice.Mee sua (noodles) with 2 kind of large prawns in soup - very nice soup.Overall a very satisfying lunch. Burp

Is been a long time since I din in hua ting.Check up some review and check their cny set lunch price finally decide to lunch there with my friend because this year is my turn to treat them.Set menu for 6 course $388++ with the ++ and angpow for the staff lunch cost about $500 which is quite expensive for 4pax.Now in Singapore dinning out is costly.Overall foods is good portion generous except the dessert red bean was a failure. Lots of starch is add and no red bean taste all four of us did not finish and we gave the waitress the feed back.Service is good staff friendly. It was on the 6 days of cny and the restaurant was not crowded.Menu lo hei salmon yu sheng, bamboo pitt shark fin, braised beef, wok fried glutinous rice, braised abalone with fa cai dried oyster and dessert red bean soup

Had the opportunity to have the Chinese New Year Reunion Lunch at Hua Ting this year with my family. Consistent excellent service all the way from Hua Ting from the time I made my lunch reservation with the restaurant. The email correspondences were prompt and courteous. Request for private room, changes to menu and additional instructions were readily arranged without any issue. Lunch on the actual day was splendid with excellent setting in the private room and attentive service provided by Hua Ting's staff (Ming Chue). Dishes were nice and the older folks like the "Cantonese taste" of the food served. Great experience overall and have made a reservation for next year's reunion dinner
5
Tastefully decorated interior with splendidly laid tables. We started off with an auspicious toss of hamachi raw fish yusheng toss,in view of the recent fresh water raw fish scare. The hamachi complements the yusheng salad even better than the ikan parang/wolf herring. The dim sum selections are also tasty and delicately crafted. The crispy fish skin in salted egg yolk is a delight to eat,going well with a crisp sauvignon blanc. The longevity buns arrive under a longevity bonzai tree made of marzipan....what a sight to be hold. Service was above adequate despite a full house. Price range is definitely medium high to high
5
This is a great Restaurant.I saw some of the reviews and one person saying how poor things are because they were dressed for a beach makes me angry. This is not a beach bar it's a good quality Singaporean Chinese restaurant.Brilliant service.Brilliant food that is deliscous.Singapore prices but you are in Singapore.Ms Donna Goh is first class and a credit to this restaurant and the service.Thank you once again.
5
This restaurant has been around for a long time, and still serves very good food, and the key dishes like suckling pig and steamed fish are still excellent ! I would stick to the tried and tested dishes, as the quality is pretty consistent for those
5
Loved it. Service was excellent, food was excellent. Peking Duck to the double boiled soup, chicken feet. They had proper glasses for bubbly and the usual red/white wine. Unfortunately, can't comment if there was corkage as I did not see the bill.
3
Hua Ting used to be one of the top notch Chinese restaurant in Singapore. However, the food quality goes up and down. Disappointed in recent dining experience.
4
Been here many times and usually very enjoyable. The trick is to find out what is fresh and what are their signature dishes. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable so we always have a balance meal of meat, seafood and veggie and wine too!
5
One of my favourite restaurant. Like all the signature dishes such as the shark cartilage soup with fish maw; crispy roast duck; XO noodles; lemon grass pork ribs and others. What I like is the service. Always attentive and offering wonderful suggestions. It has great dim sum as well. To avoid disappointment always book ahead

I was invited to dine at this restaurant by my friend who stated this place has one of the best suckling pig. Went there in casual dress code as my friend stated I should be fine dressed in shorts, T-shirt and jandals (open toe type). She did not get a reminder when she booked a reservation that there was a dress code.So four of us rocked up to the reservation table. The front desk person eyed us up and down as if she had superman X-ray vision and said sorry you cannot dress in 'open' footwear to the restaurant. meanwhile my friend stated she was not reminded or told on the phone of such dress code. I then reminded the front desk lady that some other lady just walked in with sandals which was also an 'open' footwear. SO I asked her.. why is there a footwear code for MEN BUT NOT WOMEN. She could not answer me with a convincing answer or gave me an answer that is not sexist or at the minimum a hygienic purpose. (which I would understand if you think men have more smelly feet or dirty feet). None was given. She offered us to go downstairs to buy a pair of socks. (This is SERIOUSLY ridiculous!!). By this time we had lost our appetite and excitement to try any dish at all. Then the manager who was rude walked over with a mean gangster look and passed me a pair of new socks and asked me to put it on and walk in. Again we asked why there is footwear policy only applied to MEN... no answer. I was appalled but as my friend who invited me to dinner suggested we go along, i put on the pair of socks while wearing my jandals. Then we proceeded to our table and then i took the socks OFF. And then no waiters said anything! So i just wore the socks for the 15 steps into this not-so-elegant restaurant.This was a joke as it wasnt even a five star hotel, nor a high grade fine dining quality other than its price. Most of the dishes were in small portions which one can get in Hawker stall for one fifth the price. The only thing good about the restaurant was the dessert we chose (a young coconut with ice cream and glutinuous rice). Other than that we would have gave this pricey restaurant with attitude one star.By the end of dinner, the rude manager didnt even bother return to our table and explained to us WHY there was a discriminatory dress code for guys and NOT ladies. I would not go back to this restaurant again just to be ridiculed and on the receiving end of some unjustified, self righting attitude.Food: suckling pig was okay... 7 out of 10... not the best i had in Singapore or AsiaOther dishes were in small portions - we had a vege dish with the amount of vegetable as the size of one person's hand.Dessert - we ordered coconut glutinous rice with ice cream which was the only best part of the dining experience.Corkage fee: $30... can be more expensive than your bottle of wine.. depending on your choice of wineService- friendly waiting staff but slow service and needed reminder to get dishes upAtmosphere - average... no strong Chinese atmosphere.. the tea cups looked more like Vietnamese or Tha

It's for fine Dim Sum! Good food with great taste and details all in the dim sum. Even as a member at 50%, food standard is always maintained. Unique combination of style in each dim sum. Undoubtedly one of the best and no wonder winning award every year! Thumbs up
4
We had a dim sum lunch with friends. The service was prompt and attentive. We tried the popular mango tart which was very crispy on the outside and flavorful inside. I liked the new seafood black garlic dumplings as it was surprising and not too garlicky. The shrimps used were generally fresh and tasty. You must try the bean curd skin shrimp roll. I am a fan of bean curd skin and this one doesn't disappoint. Overall very delicate on the taste buds and not overpoweringly salty like some other Chinese restaurants. It was good value for money as well with four of us coming up to 100bucks only.
4
Visited twice, first as a solo diner and second as a small group. Both times received good food and service.On the second visit, opted for one of the set menu options, food was plentiful and tasty. Price felt steep, one of the more expensive meals I had on my visit, which surprised me.
4
This is a little hard to find even if you have the location map. But it's worth looking for it. Chinese food quality is really good and authentic. Service is good to above average. Setting is simple but warm feel. Value: slightly pricey. Good place to bring guests to discuss matters as its quiet

We wanted to try this restaurant as we were in search for a good Chinese restaurant and given that it has received several awards we thought this would be a great evening. However, the service was among the worst we have ever experienced; slow and with no guidance with respect to the menu. We ordered several dishes, but I ended up receiving several of mine as where my spouse sat waiting for his until mine got cold. We had to chase the staff several time to get the food and in a way that we could eat together, and also to get the rice at the same time as the rest. The bill came out at over 200 sing dollars for two persons, just the food and one glass of wine so extremely expensive. The food was also very average. We would definitely not recommend this restaurant.

Try the Peking duck, and the double boiled soups. The service was pleasant and it gives a very family atmosphere.

I was a guest at a private dinner here. We had an excellent Chinese banquet with lots of great flavours
5
Five main courses, several with three items. First time to have chilled marinated octopus!! Fish Maw, Soon Hock, Hokkaido Scallop were also all firsts for me. Service excellent with dedicated waitress who kept the green tea glass full.
5
The thing about Chinese restaurants is that the food can be quite good, but the service is, at best, mediocre.
But I find Hua Ting has not just great food, but very attentive staff and the service is very prompt.
4
I had high expectations stepping in and i was a little disappointed when i left. For the price my partner and i paid, we could have had better service out there. The food was reasonably good but the service did not match up. Wait staff were not professional and gave us a table with flickering lights above, making the dining experience painful. The restaurant was crowded and we didn't have any other options for tables. Manager on shift tried her best to serve us and we appreciate the effort. I am glad i tried, but i don't think i will be returning

This used to be a one of the better Chinese restaurants in town but with the immense competition and an influx of new players in the dining scene, it has failed to keep up with the times, just like the dated hotel it is located in. For similar prices, there are tastier and better options elsewhere
5
Been to hua ting with family and friends many times for dinner celebrations and just to enjoy the ambience.The food is really tasty and individual servings appreciated as everyone gets an equal share. Particularly enjoy the bird's nest as the dessert.....warm and not too sweet. The staff are attentive to your needs and very polite.Always enjoy the dinner when i am there.A word of caution - covered toes shoe wear for the gentlemen. Or you have to purchase a pair of socks to enter. A gentle suggestion - good broad sandals should be allowed , especially for the elderly as some may not be comfortable in shoes. Flip flops and denim skirts may not be appropriate, i agree.All in, i strongly recommend hua ting for any one who wants a good meal

Having dined here twice in the last 2 months, Hua Ting has deteriorated greatly. I don't mind paying high prices if I feel that I'm getting the value, but this is certainly not the case for Hua Ting. Very slow service, small (stingy) portions. Food is tasty, but nothing particularly memorable. Expensive and not worth it. The Imperial Treasure and Crystal Jade chains do a far better job at lower prices
5
Went for dinner on V Day. Food was special and excellent for that particular day. Service by the staff was good too. I like the way they portion the food before serving it to the customers. Located at Orchard Hotel Level 2, it is conveniently located in the heart of Orchard Road. Must give it a try if you are staying at Orchard Hotel.

Hua Ting has been one of our regular Chinese restaurants for the past few years. We have always loved the double boiled soup, Beijing duck, homemade beancurd, steam fish with various sauce n superior shark's fins. Unfortunately lately the taste has been unsatisfactory. Double boiled soup serving temperature hasn't been satisfactory n the intensity of the soup is now nothing but diluted water. Same for the superior shark's fins. Now is becoming like inferior sharks' fins. Any hotel wedding dinner's sharks' fins can beat this now. With horrible soup, the rest of the dinner isn't worth mentioning. Spoiled my weekend night and decided to go somewhere else for good desserts :

Really great dim sum lunch , huge choice , prawn dumlings superb , very traditional , not so cheap but worth it .
5
This is an old traditional Chinese Restaurant, which had a facelift some time ago.
The Food is still very good, meticulously prepared and presented beautifully.
Small portions, but every bite full of taste and flavours.
A must visit.
4
Really enjoyed the food here.....innovative, flavoursome and enjoyable. Would recommend to others. Service was also good so all in all a positive experience.
4
Went there for CNY lunch. It was a 8-9 course lunch including soup mains and dessert.Service was good and prompt although restaurant was 80% full.Most of the dishes are above average, just good not out of world. Crispy duck, pork dish and saut√É¬©ed prawns were tasty. Environment and ambience was homely.Overall just a "normal" experience considering popularity of this restaurant

That's how long I'm waiting on the second dish to arrive. I'm still waiting in fact and while I am doing that I'm giving you all a review of this restaurant based on the only dish that was served to us. After the first dish that arrived half an hour ago... And has long since gone cold... Our table is still empty, our bowl of rice as cold as their service. How is this acceptable?? How did the rest of the reviews get 4-5 stars?? Is there like some secret codeword to get your dishes out on time? Are they operating with one chef only? What's going on?? Food wise I will have to say it is not bad but it's not fantastic either. Again this is based on the first dish. We had some deer meat of sort with onions. Simple. Oh look the second dish has arrived and it's time to start the clock again....
1
We would not recommend this restaurant.We pre booked & paid a deposit in December.Our table was not ready - after numerous complaints & more than 30 mins later we were seated. Although we pre ordered the 1st course arrived 40 mins after we were seated. The next courses were also delayed
1
Unfortunately we didn't get to look at the menu before we were shown to our table for 10 people. We struggled with the different language and service was poor I felt we were overlooked as the only Europeans present. Food was unrecognizable to what we normally eat in Chinese & Thai restaurants, Staff were not very helpful when asking about the dishes & the manageress was summoned eventually, but she appeared to have little patience with us. We waited a long time for another drink, which the waiter did apologise for. The water we requested was tepid tap water & very unpleasant. All in all a expensive and a bad choice of restaurants by u
5
Reservation definitely need be made as they have a faithful following.Food here is Cantonese and you will be spoilt for choice for selection. Penchai is also served here a pot costing over S$350 with abalone, chicken, big prawns, sea cucumber, mushroom, roasted pork and accompaniment of assorted vegetables brewed for many hours to give you a satisfying great meal. This dish's origin surfaced when the Empress Dowager was fleeing to one of its province and the peasants were very poor. Ultimately they contributed a dish each and combined all the morsels in the pot to serve her.Though on the expensive side, the chefs offer their culinary skill in their cuisine you will certainly have a palatable meal.

We had lunch with overseas guests. Was expecting good food and attentive service since much praise has been written about this place. Our previous visit was several years back and left us an average impression. We decided to give it another chance.We ordered dim sum along with the signature crispy roast duck, roast pork, soup, and a few dishes. We also specifically ordered a few of their signature dimsum for this meal. Unfortunately, the dining experience could have been better. Firstly, the flow of the food was in the wrong order. In a Cantonese restaurant, the typical flow starts with soup. But, no, we were served the baked chicken n mango tart. It was dry and nothing great. Next, we were served more dimsum. Still no sign of soup. Getting service was not easy. The staff were just avoiding eye contact. Call the next staff, perhaps. Even after requesting for the soup to be served, it was still no sign of it until later. In a good Chinese restaurant, one sign of attentive service is when the wait staff automatically fills the teacups and do it so naturally. It didn't happen here.Overall, food was not up to 'best Asian restaurant' standard and the poor service hits the nail in further
5
Hua Ting is - judging from what we saw - a high end generally expensive Chinese restaurant. But we went there to have a dim sum lunch one day - and weren't disappointed. We are far from expert when it comes to Chinese food - including dim sum (although we're not total novices either). And we live in a part of the world where Chinese food is generally inedible.Anyway - our server helped us to pick out an assortment of various dishes from the extensive menu. All were very tasty. We especially liked the egg custard buns with creamy runny egg yolks in the center. And the big surprise was the bill. About 35 SD for the two of us (apart from the Hawker Centers and food courts - Singapore is in general a pretty expensive place to eat). Highly recommended - at least for dim sum
4
Hua Ting's menu has something for everyone. Whether you're just there for simple dim sum or splurging for a special occasion, the food never disappoints.
5
There are many excellent Chinese Restaurants in Singapore. Each has its specialities and some are well known for their special offerings eg dim sum, crayfish, steamed pomfret, etc. After a while, such offerings can get "boring" for me. Now, there is a very unique Chinese Restaurant which has been around for many years and is a testimony to its popularity and specialities. The menu is never ever the same and there are always new items on the menu, a tribute to the chef for daring to experiment and to be creative. He has never failed!! Each time I visit the restaurant, my expectations are piqued by what is new on the menu. If in doubt, always ask for the chef's recommendations or to ask for new creations!! You will not be disappointed. To me, this is the best Chinese Restaurant ever, and it's always my choice if I have guests in town and I want them to have a good meal they will remember. The service is superb and the environment is classy and perfect for lunch or dinner! Do make reservations if you want to be assured of a table. Bon Appetit

Hua Ting Restaurant has been around since 1992, and is an established restaurant featuring high quality Cantonese cuisine combining with modern recipes. They also serve dim sum over the weekends. We had a dinner here last evening as a party of nearly 50 persons, and in spite of the restaurant being filled to capacity, the service was excellent. Drinks were promptly refilled, waitress attentive and polite. The ambiance was very much an old world charm with antique furniture.Our dishes included the roasted whole golden suckling pig which was presented with a deliciously crispy skin with no visible fat, topped with a flat steamed bun and garnished with spring onion shoots.Next was the doubled boiled chicken soup with Yunnan shimeji mushrooms and fish maw. The clear soup was very tasty, with the slightly bitter crunchy mushrooms, sweetened by the lean chunks of chicken meat. We then had the bamboo pith stuffed with golden mushrooms and braised with local spinach and conpoy. Again, a crunchy texture from the mushrooms, although the spinach was a tad over done.The pating fish cooked with spring onions, shallots, red chili and peppercorn in a casserole was a let down. The fish meat was mushy with lots of small bones making it difficult to eat, and some may find the seasoning too peppery. The salt baked chicken with danggui was next. The portions of chicken looked like it‚Äôs been hacked with a blunt chopper, although the meat was very tender falling off the bone. Flavored with anise and herbs, it was nice to experience something different. The braised noodles with fresh crab meat, egg white a salmon roe was tasty, but there was a slightly strong aroma of the salmon roe.In all, a very satisfying dinner, and we would likely return as the menu has a lot more to offer in terms of variety.The restaurant is situated on the second floor of the Orchard Hotel on Orchard Road. Ample parking space underground.Address: 442 Orchard Road, Orchard Hotel, Singapore 238879.Tel:(+65) 6739 6666.Operating hours: Daily: 11.30am - 2.30pm, 6.30pm - 10.30pmThe premises is wheel chair friendly.

This place I will be proud to bring my family, close friends & overseas guests in Singapore! The chinese food and service were top class! Very yummy, even the tea there will make you very relaxed....try their signature dish cater per person....valued and delicious! Thank you Hua Ting! I will come back again and again
4
It's a sad fact that many restaurants these days are unable to cope with a full house due to shortage of staff. However, the staff here certainly tries their best.Have not tried their dim sum but the dishes here were finely done and lived up to the many accolades won
5
This is THE restaurant for consistently good Chinese food. You can eat reasonably well on a tight budget as well as the skies the limit! I have never been disappointed with the food served and visit it every other month. Considering there are many other good Chinese restaurants, this is one of the best
5
In my opinion, after doing extensive research and tasting most of the dim sum restaurants in Singapore, Hua Ting has had the best standards in dim sum. Everything I had was really delicious, and I can‚Äôt say there was any dish I would not order. This makes deciding my order that much harder.Try Hua Ting‚Äôs XO chilli sauce as well, which is the winner in a blind taste-test held sometime ago. Sold in bottles for takeaway too.It gets really crowded here during meal times and they are typically fully seated, so do make reservations.I give Hua Ting Restaurant 3 thumbs up. Highly recommended Chinese restaurant
4
It is hard to imagine a Chinese restaurant that is not ostentatiously decorated could be fine dining but it is. Instead of the usual ala carte items we order, this time round we decided to try the set menu. We ordered the Opal signature menu set for two persons. Each dish is individually portioned and served. No complains about the quality of food. Everything tasted excellent especially the shark's fin soup (yes I know I will be offending the senses of many). My only grouse is the seating in the restaurant. We were seated at an obscure corner next to an alternative exit to the washrooms. Not a match to the fine dining concept and price.Hua Ting is not a cheap Chinese restaurant to go to on a regular basis but its worth a try if you feel like splurging on good Chinese food
5
Have been to Hua Ting many times, Service is very attentive and unobtrusive. Being just before Chinese New Year we tossed a "Yu Sheng" for good luck and fortune. This has been the best I have ever tasted not heavy but very pleasing and a sense of freshness
3
The restaurant is located in the Ochard Hotel in Singapore. We came early on a Wednesday evening and the restaurant was not full. The wine choice is decent but expensive and the decent wines are only sold by the bottle. The wine by the glas was average but ok. Food was decent but nothing special. Overall not bad but there are better local chinese food restaurants than Hua Ting
5
Just had dinner at Hua Ting...food was excellent, especially the suckling pig.
It was yummylicious...
Every dish was done to perfection.
The soon hock fish was excellent.
Liked the french beans with fried golden mushrooms.
3
Price Is too much for over branded Chinese food. Won't recommend anyone to visit as it is not tasty at all
5
I heard this was the best place for Peking Duck in Singapore. It is very good indeed. The traditional pancakes are delicious and the remainder of the beast was stir fried and served in lettuce cups. The service was friendly and efficient.
3
Was there yesterday for business lunch. Surprisingly, it was half full even at the peak lunch time. Hua Ting used to be one of the best Chinese restaurants in Singapore serving very good Dim Sum and Cantonese cuisine. The food we had was quite ordinary especially the dim sum. Not so sure why the food quality standard has dropped but for service wise, it is still excellent. I hope to revisit this restaurant again and see some improvements just like the good old days
1
Arrived 10 minutes before the restaurant opened. Was told by a service staff to wait. That was fine. When the restaurant finally did open it's doors, the male host told us that it was fully booked and that there was no way that they could accommodate us. He wasn't even apologetic. It doesn't say anywhere on the website that the restaurant only accepts guests with reservations. It is also unacceptable for a hotel that claims to be an upscale hotel to book it's restaurants up so fully that there is no table for walk-ins. We've heard good things about the food, but this service is a real put-off. You're better off taking your money across the street to Yan Ting at The St. Regis. We proceeded downstairs to Noodles as an alternative, only to be told that the place was "not ready" and would open at 1130 even though it clearly stated 11 as the opening time on the menu! We're never coming back to this hotel.
4
Was there for lunch (Tim Sum) sometimes in July. It was our first visit. Staff were very friendly and attentive right at entrance to those who took our orders. Our plates were constantly changed even though the restaurant was full. Will definitely return again to try other food in menu. Keep up the good work to the service crew

this is a good restaurant and its reputation precedes it. we were invited for a dinner by a friend in a private room. and wasnt aware of the furore surrounding dress code. luckily we were properly dressed. but it is a favoured location for business entertainment. the ambience is good and you can feel its a posh restuarant when you step in. i found the service to be extremely good and the staff most obliging. the food is very commendable in that we had ordered dishes or courses as the Chinese would call it. it was a 10 course for the 8 of us. we found all the courses thoroughly authentic. as this place is expensive , it is not a place to go for sweet and sour pork or just roast duck :)but my good friend , the host is a regular customer, thus perhaps there was special attention paid to us. i think the meal was fairly expensive at the end of the day but as guests we thoroughly enjoyed the meal.i think this is a good place for offcial entarinment, or for that quiet important family diiner ( for a special celebration). if you are wanting casual dining perhaps this place might not be it, not unless you have a deep pocket :

I was hosting a lunch in the private room at Hua Ting yesterday. Both my clients are in casual smart attire but due to hot weather, one of them wore a pair of shoes with some thin gap in between but it's a covered shoe. It is not even sandal but The staff insisted that he wear socks and they took out a new pair of socks from the drawer which charged it to the final bill. To me he looks presentable as he dressed in short sleeve shirt and long pants which is smart casual. I told the staff that since we are dining in private room and it is very embarrassing to do this to guests, furthermore he is wearing a proper kind of shoes and not any type of open sandals etc, this requirement can be waived. To my big disappointment, he was still very rigid and said no. In the end I explained to my client and get him to wear it in the room. The whole episode was just too weird and embarrassing.Meals was ok like any Chinese food standard and the service was good. But the front male staff spoiled the lunch mood for us for insisting "socks on" policy without any consideration and being rigid. I will never go back to Hua ting again. In the evening we went to Jade Palace at Forum mall, the food was very good and all the staff were very professional and friendly. The restaurant was still crowded at 10.30pm! Thanks to Hua Ting, I have found a much better chinese restaurant just right across from the road. Strongly recommended for those who love Chinese cuisine. The wines of the same type and brands are much cheaper there also
5
I went to this restaurant three times within two months.The Dim Sum is excellent,such as baked tart with chicken and mangoes, baked pie stuffed with mushrooms, fried carrot cakes with scallop etc.The fried Horfun (wat-dan), roased duck and pork are also very well done. Price is reasonable and service is good
5
Celebrated my dad's 60th there. The staff were extremely accommodating with my requests for the function. They provided a comprehensive list of Set Menus for the 6 table function ranging between the upper 800 region all the way to over 1500. They were also reasonably flexible with my request to change certain dishes. Special thanks to Huay Ping, Yanny and Irene for helping put together an extremely memorable event for me. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are hosting a small function of up to 6 tables. Not the first time I'd been here and I dare say that the quality of what you get relates directly with the price. Last I was there we went for the most expensive of everything and glad to say we were not dissapointed. This time round we decided to manage costs abit but suffice to say, we were still more than content - the amongst other things fried fish was absolutely fantastic.The function room did have 2 huge pillars in it but the staff were nice enough to consult on seating and table arrangements to ensure that everyone got a good line of sight to the VIP table. Compliments on helping through the planning phase all the way till the end of the function esp on that busy mother's day
4
My hubby always entertain his clients at this restaurant. We visit this place as a family at least once a month. Price is not cheap but it is worth every cent as you enjoy your food oh so much !
4
Delicious and well thought out food with some differences. It's high end, so you have old time favourites dressed up in good looking plates of food.
5
This restaurant is beautifully decorated with deep red colors and has excellent dim sum and other Chinese delicacies.
5
Have a variety off authentic Chinese food chosen for me. The price was much less than I expected at the end!
4
Went for dim sum lunch twice. it was the custard bun that attracted me back to the restaurant. Dim sum choices are quite limited but the quality of the food is excellent. the ambience is also nice and classy. congee is expensive and small serving. perch fish congee was delicious, just too pricey at $10. my friend ordered century egg porridge and it costs $8, taste was alright...nothing special for the expensive price. average price of dim sum is about $4.50 which is okay. the best was the custard bun. warm and oozing salted yolk custard from your first bite. prawn chee cheong fun and bbq pork pastry were great too. just a point I would like to bring out is that their tea cups are huge and chunky they don't look nice for such a classy place serving quality Cantonese food. it would be better if they used the traditional small tea cups since this is a Cantonese restaurant.oh yes there's 15% off if u pay with credit card
4
Hua Ting is my favourite place in SG to have dim sum. Their dim sum is delicious! Although quite limited variety (maybe about 20-25 kinds), the quality of the food is good. You also dont have to wait long for the food to be served. The ambience is good as well - imagine high class chinese restaurant. Service is ok, but it can get pretty bad when it is pack. I normally have to wait quite a bit for my bill. My advice is to make reservation as it can get pack during the weekends. Call atleast 4 days before
5
Hua Ting is one of the places I love to go for my lunch. They are one of the best Chinese restaurants with an affordable price tag. The quality of their However carpark fee is expensive. I usually pay $8 for a close to 1.5hr parking. Will love to be back more often, provided the carpark fee is cheaper
5
On first glance of the menu I was thinking that i'm going to struggle to order something - but on recommendations we ended up having a delicious meal. Not for the fussiest of eaters and if you're only keen on "anglo Chinese" probably not the place for you. Staff there were superb.
4
The Dim Sum is really good compared to some of the five stars hotels. They have a wide variety of dim sum for selection and the foods served are fresh and tasty. One thing you have to take note is that if you wish to visit this restaurant, please made your booking 2 weeks in advance. The proven that how popular this restaurant is
4
Certainly one of the better meals we have had in Singapore. We chose to celebrate my mum's 70th with a typical Chinese banquet. Eight courses later, we were completely stuffed! Food was of a very high quality, beautifully presented and served efficiently and brightly. The staff were very accommodating, even allowing changes to the set menu and providing us with birthday buns to open the celebration.Highly recommene
5
execellent food and service; very traditional Cantonese cuisine.
5
One of the best cantonese cuisines around often winning awards.
Try the suckling pig, peking duck...just about anything and everything is good!
4
Smallish Cantonese restaurant, in the Orchard Hotel, traditional decor, full midweek, reasonable service, great menu and lovely food. Wines on the pricey side, food prices reasonable for quality provided. Suit business or private dining, Best to book. Would recommend.
5
The service from start to finish was exceptional. The menu extensive. The quality of the food spoke for itself. The way the chefs did not stick to the boring famliar asian food. The way the chefs allowed the ingredients to take centre stage. We loved watching the staff who alllooked amazingly happy & worked as 1 of the best teams I have ever witnessed. The restaurant is a credit to the Millennium Hotel Group
1
After reading the reviews about this restaurant I was excited to dine here.The menu is HUGH....there is far too much choice and too many menus to pick from (I think we received 4 different ones)I let my partner pick the dishes and we were both left unimpressed by the dishes. They lacked flavour and substance
4
One of the best Peking Duck in Singapore. Amazing roast pork ribs. Hua Ting offers great dim sum too! And the mango chicken pastry is a must eat during lunch. During weekends, please make reservation for their lunch dim sum 2 weeks in advance. As a local n been here a couple of times, no doubt my best suggestion for quality Cantonese food.
1
Good chef and food but one of worst service chinese restaurant in Singapore. Pity the management of this restaurant is not doing anything about it.
5
We tried to get in Hua Ting on spec before and it was full....so that made us want to try it again.....and WOW we were not disappointed.The waiter knew exactly how much, what type of food went with what and when it came....it was absolutely lovely!Currently I am working and my family are going again on Monday.....so jealous!!!!!

Having had excellent meals @ Hua Ting Restaurant over the years, we decided to hold a birthday celebration there early September and made reservation a week in advance requesting for a good table. On arrival we were somewhat disappointed getting a small table in a poor location, in other parts of the restaurant 4 diners were sharing a same-sizied table in a much better location. When ordering we asked whether the restaurant could make one of the set menus for 8 persons instead of for 10, and were told that this was not possible, but that the portions were not big, so the 10-person menu would be fine for 8 persons. Mistake No. 1. We ordered tea and had brought our own red wine, and were told that the corkage was S$ 30++ which is high for a Chinese Restaurant in Singapore, but no big problem. When they started to serve the meal 15-20 minutes later, no tea or red wine had arrived, the wine and wine glasses only arrived after 1 reminder, but we had to remind the staff 3 times to get our tea, and each time a different staff asked us what type of tea we wanted. The PRC staff did their best, but was obviously not well trained, and should never have been released to be front line staff in a supposedly reputable restaurant. Twice the staff managed to drop prawn shells on our guests. The food was very ordinary, and apart from the steamed prawns and the roast duck, the other 8 dishes were extraordinarily ordinary, the same big tough mushrooms were found both in the soup and the following vegetable dish, the fresh fruit included damaged grapes and unripe papaya and melon. It should be added that our tea was not replenished once during the whole meal, until it was brought to the attention of the staff. Needless to say that the food for the 10 person menu was far to much for 8 persons, and we had to cancel/reduce 2-3 of the courses. Having vented our frustrations for the 3rd time to one of the many supervisors, they gracefully waived the corkage charge, and we were left with a 8-person food bill of over S$ 900 and a very bad lingering taste. We are thankful that Singapore is such a gourmet's paradise with so much choice that we do not have to go back
2
Sure the food is good. (I got a Peking Duck). And the place is OK. The service however is quite poor (even in Singapore standards!) and very slow. Welcoming was done by someone hardly speaking English. While then I ordered (to an English speaking waitress), I was asked whether I wanted the meat with the pancakes or after, but wasn't told there would be an extra if taken separately (+SGD 10 - I would have accepted anyway but don't like the "fait accomplis"). I was offered a number of possible style for the meat out of which I selected XO sauce that I love. And I was offered some rice. What actually came, very late, was totally different with no rice. Since I wanted to see the World Cup match, I had no time to get what I actually ordered. So I ate what I got and then mentioned the fact when paying: instead of the excuses I should have received, the waitress disappeared and sent a colleague with my change. Very rude!Bottom line: I am sure I can find other good Chinese restaurants in Singapore, with a good service
5
Definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants around. I like it that the ingredients used are always fresh. The chef is also careful in not over-dousing the food with oil and seasoning thus preserving the natural taste of the ingredients.
3
A little too pricey
4
Good food
5
Two words - very good.
My guy who is a huge fan of chinese cuisine love this restaurant.
4
Nice food

Great food & service!
3
Yes, good.

Went there a couple of time for normal chinese dinner (informal, not wedding) and quite disappointed esp since it's quite exp.
5
Hua Ting is a great Restaurant, outstanding Cantonese Cuisine. There are other Restaurants at this level but from my frequent Travels to Singapore, learned that this one is truly outstanding. The one thing you will notice, that you do not find many foreigners there unless they have been invited, meaning that locals treasure this restaurant and prefer to keep it that way
5
Hua Ting is one of my favourite, if not my absolute favourite chinese restaurant in Singapore. The cuisine here is mainly cantonese, but it dips its fingers into other territories as well, and sometimes it may even venture into fusion territory. However, whether you order some weird sounding dish you've never heard of, or if you order staples like Peking Duck, Sucking Pig or Roast Duck, you can be sure to expect quality. The food is always of the highest standard and looks as though it has been prepared with lots of love and care
5
Dim sum, soup and roast meat here never disappoints me.
4
love the foods :D
5
my favourite peking duck
4
This is definately 1 of the best chinese restaurant in town, especially their Dim Sum, nothing but freshness and authentic Chinese cuisine taste assured.

5
My favourite dim sum restaurant. Everything is top-notch. Reservations required even during weekdays.
4
Great food, good service. Smart casual attire required
3
i don't like the lunch/dinner sets, ordering from the ala carte menu has proven to be a wiser choice. love the shark cartilege soup, crispy skin duck, cod fish.. food is portioned individually and served fine dining western style.
3
nice ambience,gd service..but overall on food,not really value for money..their crispy roasted duck is good though..
5
One of the finest Chinese restaurants around in Singapore. We come here for the lobster noodles which are probably the closest in taste and feel to the Mandarin Kitchen lobster noodles in London which we, as impoverished students, would shamelessly sponge off whichever unsuspecting parent was in town and prepared to spring for the meal. I've never had a bummer dish here
4
very traditional cantonese cuisine..quite ex..
4
Great chinese food....
3
Food is ok.
5
definitely a winner - wonderful cantonese food. the shark cartilage soup is fantastic!
