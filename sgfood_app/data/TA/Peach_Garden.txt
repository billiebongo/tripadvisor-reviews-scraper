Peach garden has good double boiled soups. Had my Chinese New Year reunion dinner there. Food is well presented. Service is a little slow though. But overall i love the food and the friendly service.

Tried the restaurant as they were offering 52% off the Peking duck! The duck was quite good, the pancakes came prepared so the skin was not so crispy, but still nice. We also had the wasabi prawns and a pork dish recommended by the waitress both of which was also nice. Service was quick. Overall a good meal and worth a try.

Had dinner there after coming back from Penang. Place was pretty busy with a short queue (about 10 mins) outside for available table. We ordered the Peking duck (on offer), sliced fish fried, vege, roast pork and chicken and noodles. The soup was sold out, unfortunately. Service is swift and efficient. Waiters are busy but still attentive. The food all tasted very good, the usual trusted Peach Garden standard. Bill is at $135/-, slightly on the high side. Still a recommended restaurant to visit for a good quality chinese food
