Hooters is on Clarke Quay and serves a good assortment of food. Service is great and so are the girls. Right on the Singapore River. Eat abd watch the Bum Boats go by. Great place

Great Food , good ambiance and the not that bad Drinks. We were hungry so was not really bothered about the drinks however the drinks can be better. The food is very tasty and the quality is Good. Quantity isn't bad either. I recommend this place

Hmmm how to say... I have been to this branch and I don't think we will come back. We came during lunch time and it took them 40min to serve pasta and 50 min for the 'sandwich' (actually burger) from their lunch set menu. The food was pretty basic and place was not full so we don't understand how the service could be thus slow... We finished the food in 10min as we were getting late for work. I believe this place will need to come for drinks only and if you have a lot of time ahead.

Opposite Clarke Quay Central with lovely river view. We sat and watched the boats go up and down the river whilst we enjoyed a lovely lunch. Meals beautifully presented. Service excellent. Best of all was that the price was really good by Singapore standards so it was great value for money. If we ever had the privilege of visiting Singapore again this is the restaurant I would choose to have all my meals at. I had a wonderful chicken salad!!!
