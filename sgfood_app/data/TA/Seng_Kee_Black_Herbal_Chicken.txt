My friends strongly recommend this place to me and brought me there for dinner during my business trip to Singapore. Lots of visitors and almost all table sit with customers.

Have been to this Outlet for more than 30 years and the standard never dropped. Be it during their peak weekend dinner or their newly added weekday lunch.It's used to operates only for dinner but since about a year ago, they started as early as 11am.Their Herbal Vermicelli Soup is my favourite. The taste never changed at all... loves it.The herbal not but too herbal taste! Haha! You taste it and you will be asking for more.They have it in only pork slices, or a mixture of with pork liver, kidney, stomach.At only $4 a bowl, cheap and good
