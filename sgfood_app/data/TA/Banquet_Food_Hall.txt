Learnt the trick of recognizing the good stalls. The Govt Health Dept rate each store and if you see a A or B displayed on the wall then rated top for cleanliness. No letter displayed give it a miss. Food we had was very nice.

This is a busy, authentic food hall, every kind of chinese food you could possible want. Very cheap, trouble finding a seat but well worth it.

Banquet Food Hall at VivoCity/ Harbourfrount station now become Kopitiam...it splits become two entrance the right one is for all halal food. you can find Padang food, Noodle, etc from 5 SGD (exclude drink), i think only one drink store there (if i am not mistake). once there a long time ago, i came to the left side and the food merchants said "No Halal" instead of my hijab. they are very appreciate to the Muslim.

lunch time could really pack the whole place up so be alert in finding a table as office employees from all over the area around Marina Bay eat here. Next to hawkers, this place has the cheapest food choices friendly to the backpackers' pockets. (visited March 2011

For Muslim Traveler (especially from Indonesia), if you want to look for Halal Food Hall in Singapore, Banquet is. The food stall in this place all have Halal Certification.The food taste is variety, because many food stall in there. But what muslim like about, they use and wash the kitchen / dinning utensil separately from non-halal food. This is also one of Muslim concern about.The price is relatively standard compared to other food hall. So this is one of safe food hall for Muslim
