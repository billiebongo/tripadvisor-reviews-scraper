Same dal like in Little India, Same pepper chicken.. All awesome..
Reminds me of Indian food.
Good to have a party time.
Its Muslim restaurant. So for beer, can go around and then come to eat in here..

Had a birthday celebration dinner there. Overall food was good.
Both vegetarian and non veg starters were good.
In the main course, The naans were fluffy and fresh, like the authentic Pakistani cuisine.

A must visit for us whenever we visit Singapore because I love Pakistani food and also because it is on Arab Street which is very happening. Food is halal and the place is very neat!

Every time I go to Singapore and look for Pakistani foods I always visit my favorite Usman Place, cheap, friendly staff and helpful owner. Biryani and Kebab Lembu are my regular dishes and black coffee.

I ordered food from this place hoping for a good lunch. The food was absolutely tasteless. The butter chicken was full of artificial colouring and there was no flavour. The chicken tikka was very raw and also had way too much colouring and the keema, even though I had specified for it to be spicy, it was completely bland and had way too much oil. I was really hoping for a better experience. Very unlikely to eat from here again

Visited the place in December 2016, the branch has moved to 336 Bedok Road. Food is as excellent as ever, good ambience and suitable for families. For those who dont want to go to Usmans at Sernagoon Road the Restaurant at Bedok is a good alternative

I love bringing large groups of friends here to eat. They serve buffet for lunch. For dinner, you should order nihari, palak paneer, fried paneer, assorted naan basket and malai tikka!I come back often not only because of the good food but the staff are really friendly and remember what you like

This branch just opened recently and we dined inside the aircon restaurant, but they have ample outside tables and space. We went on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was very quite, but the food was really good. This is my first visit to a Pakistan restaurant in Singapore. The fish tikka was not what I expected but was a delightful dish, very tasty. The palak paneer got the thumbs up from my wife. The restaurant itself is very clean with colourful wall tiles

This is a frequent haunt and the food has been exceptionally good . We enjoy the garlic naan, kebabs and biryani . To add to this, the hospitality is amazing and reminds me of India :) on the last few occasions , the chef even whipped up fresh khichdi for our little one . Hands down one of the best Pakistani restaurants in Singapore and that's coming from an Indian :)

I've been frequenting this restaurant since a friend introduced it to me in 2013. Ever since, this has been my to-go place for my naan and paneer cravings. I LOVE the Chicken Malai Tikka and the wonderful mint sauce that comes with it. You might beg to differ, but to me it's like a taste of heaven!!As far as I know, the food served is highly authentic and the quality has been rather consistent. The same waiters have been there for years and are always eager to serve. However, while the food is superb, I think the drinks are of an average standard only. A buddy and I hosted a large group of people here before, about close to 20 pax, and the restaurant was able to comfortably accommodate us all. The kitchen and staff demonstrated great ability to cope with our crowd. I've been to other Indian/ Pakistani places but I still think Usmans' is best!!(if you know any better places that i should try, please drop me a private message :D
