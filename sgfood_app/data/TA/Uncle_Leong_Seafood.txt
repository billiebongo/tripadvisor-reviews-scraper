On 27 Jan,2018, my family and I went Uncle Leong for dinner to celebrate my birthday. The waiters and waitresses are very friendly and keen to serve. Food is nice and not too pricey. Value for money.
5
Enjoyed the food, the service, the ambience. Lovely place for a simple night out to eat, chat and just relax.
5
Ordered both Chilli and butter crab. Chilli crab had the right consistency and flavour, without being too spicy. Butter crab was rich and creamy, without being too overpowering.
5
Good service as always. Apart from its crab dishes, other dishes are great too.
This place is popular so resevation is required to avoid the wait during peak hours.
5
Been a long time since i ate such good Mee Goreng.
This place famous for their seafood, but have to say that their mee goreng is very well done.
GOOD!
4
It feel good to be attended to before you signal intention. It was quite a busy evening but the service personnel is good.
3
Salted egg crab is quite fresh, chilli crab was not flavourful enough. Service is not bad. Food was decent :)
4
Been to many Uncle Leong branches and this is our first time to this Punggol branch. Overall, good atmosphere and very condusive indoor and outdoor seatings. But the signature chilli crab was slightly disappointing with watery and too-sweet gravy.
4
I had my dinner with my family on 5th Dec. The food were delicious and e waitress was patient to share with us the selection of food n the portion to order. Overall a nice experience eating there
5
Excellent Service. The waiting time was long but it was worth it. Very impressed with the level of service and attentiveness of the staff. Staff was worried that the children may be hungry with the long wait and offered fried buns for us. They even offered to let us have free dessert as a form of service recovery! Really appreciate their effort for making a difference with such good customer experience! Excellent team and surely will recommend to my friends and return for more good food!
5
Food and services were excellent! Friendly and approachable staff! Thumbs up! Chilli crabs are their signature dish! Love their crab bee hoon as well!
3
The crab bee hoon standard has dropped, not sure if the chef is different or what. Will not order it again.
4
Fresh and good crab and other dishes is also good! Worth the visit and will definitely return again. Most probably the best crab restaurant in Singapore
5
Must ti try the shimmering , chilli crabs. Super nice.
Perfect to go with the buns. Three eggs veggies is a must to eat. N the fish over there is very fresh. Ask for steam de.
4
Try the crab bee hoon soup. crab is very fresh. value for money. nice ambience facing the greenery. the coffee ribs is tasty but the coffee aroma can be stronger
3
Chilli crab with Mantou was excellent. Guiness pork ribs were good too. However I advised anyone visiting the place wear mosquito patch there. I got 4 huge nasty bites on both my legs.
5
We have ordered shimmering sand crab taste good.. butter sauce with light pepper and curry leaves :)
5
When my friends from overseas requested for me to bring them to a seafood place I frequent, I knew I had to choose Uncle Leong. And we were not disappointed. My friends loved the food. And service was really prompt and friendly.
3
The food is great. My overseas friends loved the shimmering sand crab. It is a family orientated restaurant and the waiting staff service were great and polite too. I have to comment on how the restaurant manages reservations and walk in customers. Since I had overseas guests visiting, I thought I should make reservations to prevent them from waiting too long. When we got to the restaurant, there were two lines - one for walk ins and one for reservations. Instead of any priority given to the guests with reservations, the restaurant alternate between walk in and reservation. If that is the case, then what is the point of anyone making any reservations at all? We had to wait about 30 minutes before we were seated.Other than that, I think this place has great food. Great crabs
4
Food is nice and delicious. Service is also very good, both the waiter and waitress were very polite. Provide good advise and recommendation in term of the quantity of food for the right no. of people. Atmosphere is great inside and spacial to move around. The crab was fresh and price was reasonable, all the dishes was delicious and it was an enjoyable dinner throughout the night. There is one thing missing as there was no complementary parking provided. There are other dishes have not try and will go back again to try different type of Crab in the menu.
5
Service was prompt and efficient, food came shortly after we ordered. Food was delicious. My family and I can‚Äôt wait to go back again :)
5
Not crowded even on Friday night. Great customer service and great environment. Food wise is not bad.
5
It was my first time experience to eat here, becoz of the huge crab. I also like the taste of cereal prawns, creamy butter crabs a good thumbs up. üëç
5
Although the location is abit far from the city centre it‚Äôs by the punggol waterway and has nice views.
Food is very fresh and value for money. Really liked the golden sand crab! Very solid meat.
3
It is a nice restaurant away from crowded place. Plenty of car parking space so no need to rush. Crab and seafood are nicely cooked and delicious.
3
Food was served very promptly. Good service from the waiters and waitresses. They served us free desserts because it was a birthday celebration for my sister. Nice gesture.
5
Make a booking at the restaurant as wanted our overseas friends to have a feast with our local food especially our chilli crab and bee join crab. Never disappoint you with the friendly service and prompt responses. Have to say never been disappointed with them in terms of food quality and service. Only down side is the location which is a bit off
1
The weekly family dinner brought us to this restaurant. The service crew were very good . We had many dishes. Three types of crab. Chilli . Pepper. And shimmering sand. The shimmering sand crabs was the best. Anyway the curry prawns was so blend. The tau fu was nothing to shout about. But the price that was paid did not justify the quality. I would say recommended if you have a steep pocket and a craving for shimmering sand crabs. It's just a name they put on. Nothing fantastic
3
I would say the staffs are very friendly and helpful. Love the chilli crab, it was our expectation. The chai po steam fish was disappointed. Fish served cold and was not fresh. The place is very noisy, we could hardly hear each other, so it is not a good place for business chat
5
My colleagues and I had a great time dining at Uncle Leong and will definitely come back again!A few things we ordered were: creamy butter crab, black pepper crab and cereal prawns, all of which were very nice :) and oh, the staff service was great too :
3
The foods are good however the price are a little overprice.
We can get more in other restaurant with the price we pay
4
The crew service well. The environment still consider quite nice. The food still can be improve and also the price can be slightly more reasonable.
5
Would recommand my friends to come for food. Service is great and friendly. Food is excellent. Location is far.
5
First time trying the crab thick bee hoon in broth and was pleasantly surprised by it! Subtle ginger fragrance, umami seafood froth, all soaked up by the thick bee hoon and crab. Absolutely delicious!
5
Their service is very good! They know I am deaf and try their best to serve us without problems. Their details about food is good. Their food is so fresh and good!
5
Uncle leong punggol is excellent choice for crab lover. Must try its ÈáëÊ≤ôËüπ!! It's nearby to chill out place like container restaurants which serve value beer and drinks after dinner
5
Home to the best tasting crabs in Singapore, by far! We had the black pepper and the white pepper versions, and they were incredibly flavourful. It's a little pricier than most, but for the taste, well worth the journey to Punggol.
4
Food was ok. But I have to say the service was superb. As there was only 2 of us, the staff was nice enough to tell us when we have ordered enough instead of just letting us over ordered.Every one there was polite and attentive. Would go back again
5
We visited Uncle Leong Seafood at Tebing Lane on 26 August 2017 for dinner. The service staff were very attentive. We had two toddlers, and a few times they played with chopsticks and dropped them on the floor. Every time a service staff would spot it and promptly replace with a clean set of chopsticks. Never seen such proactive service before
4
The overall process was fast and the service staff were polite and observant to our needs. We ordered 2 crabs and the signature prawns. Eat the prawns while its warm otherwise it's quite gross. Love the chilli crab but felt the cream based one had not much taste
4
Love the clay pot crab with bee hoon. Very refreshing taste. Good service too, will definitely come again.
5
excellent food all round. slightly expensive but one of the best chilli crabs around. Crabs are very fresh
4
Got an offer with Chope. Food came fuss-free. Bill of $350 for 6 pax, inclusive of 2 crabs. Pretty nice. Will visit again when there is such a deal.
5
Excellent environment and food. Especially their signature hor fun. Highly recommended for family gathering.
4
Great food and service! Nice atmosphere! Prices a little steep but worth the quality of the food. Will visit again.
4
Went on a weekday night - not too crowded. Staff was very attentive and helpful. Food was great but sauce could have been hotter (temperature wise)
5
We came for the Chilli crab which is our all time Favourite. Waiter was very kind to inform and even showed us the 1.6Kg crab previously selected did not have much flesh despite the heavy weight. The second crab which he chosen for us was very fresh and meat was firm and satisfactory. Very happy with their professionalism and politeness. Will sure visit again.
5
Very good service, food are nice, staffs are very initiative when they see i have children one staff carry my child into the highchair, another staff taking order recommend change the ribs to soft bone pork so easier to chee for the kids & green dragon veg can add salted fish n bean sprout without additional cost, my mum dropped her chopstick when the staff is quite distance away and they are very attentive and run over to change for her, all staffs are very friendly
4
i was surprise by the location they have with a delicate touch of design . The food was unexpectedly finger licking good . was recommended by a friend when i was shopping at waterway point , punggol . will go there again when the chance arises .
3
My 3 rd time here for dinner . I tried the set menu with the steam fish . As usual the crab , pork ribs were good however the steamed garoupa is disappointing . Think the fish being frozen for a long time n the meat is not so tasteful n texture is rough compared to a fresh fish . Service staff is good as usual
5
Very focused on service. Food is awesome. Come early for good seats. There is a 5% service charge to take note of. It's not 10%.
4
Service is good and staff are friendly and able to give good advise on how much and what food to order.
4
Big space and nice food. Nearby has the prawn fishing pool, kids can spend the time. And adults can enjoy the food.
4
The food was good in terms of portion and taste. The service was very good as staffs were polite and responsive. And finally, the ambience was excellent, as it's situated along the Punggol Promenade.
5
Food was excellent and the service was an ace. Ambience can be better thou. Special recommendations for the butter crab!
4
The chilli crab was so good that servings of mini buns were ordered repetively to enjoy the gravy. Despite ordering a male crab, the flesh was tender and juicy.
5
Could not find any restaurant with seats except for Uncle Leong Seafood. So selected it and am happy with the choice. The service was friendly and efficient. The food was delicious and reasonablely priced except for the vrab which is quite costly.
4
The bee Hoon crab soup is just wonderful and super delicious. The crab was fresh and succulent. 2 of us took a 0.9kg crab and one clay pot tofu which were more than enough for both of us. The service is courteous and the tables are well spread out and not too packed together. Being at Punggol and supposedly a neighborhood seafood restaurant, we were expecting a better price for the crabs but it cost $75 per kg. The clay pot is also good with lots of ingredients
4
Great and attentive service . Average price for crab however do not find the meat of crab as good elsewhere . Crab noodle soup a little salty . The pepper crab meat is " hollow " Other dishes like vegetables etc not too bad .Ambience is ok .
5
I have tried pepper crab from many restaurants in Singapore, but so far Uncle Leong is one of the best I have tried so far! When the carb was served, you can smell of pepper, ofcourse I sneezed but surely it was yummy! Other dishes, i.e. Oatmeal shrimp was also good. The noodle was a bit salty but overall was a good dining experience
4
Food was better than jumbo. Kai Lan was bitter on that day we had it.overall it was above average.will recommend friends over again.
4
nice place to dine in with family. The service is very good and attentive. Crab fresh n fish skin delicious
5
Seafood are fresh and taste good!
All dishes are not oily.
The service is good and efficient.
Definitely, we will visit the restaurant again.
5
I did not expect this place to be so crowded during the weekend. Despite that staff are still very attentive and helpful. Food are delicious as well.
4
Great dinning environment seated outside and great services provided. Fresh tasteless seafood. Fully enjoy our dinner experience! Will go back again.
5
Friendly and good service. Foods are nice but a little expensive. Will be better if the tea is being served in pot rather than on per cup basis.
5
Truly excellent crab (had sand crab and black pepper - best ever), friendly service going above and beyond, view of river, rural feeling, and people fishing for prawns beside us, this place was a pleasure to discover
4
Arranged birthday party for my brother and managed to view Uncle Leong feedback. Overall all was good & value for money. Service was prompt & we were comfortable from time we step in till end of party. Staff was very proficient & manage very well although the place was near to full capacity. Portion of good was perfect for pax required per menu & no food wastage was noticeable. Highly recommend for big group but transport is a problem if you don't drive.
4
Looking for the famous Singapore Chili Crab? Check out Uncle Leong's Seafood Restaurant. We visited the location at Tao Payoh. Great selection of fresh seafood. We enjoyed the Cereal Prawns...tasty and fresh, with a hint of curry leaf. We had 2 styles of crab...Pepper Crab, and the Chili Crab. I enjoyed the chili crab the best, especially the socially chosen female crab with roe. You can order a side of fried buns to dip I the sauce. The Coffee Ribs were interesting too. Look forward to coming back the next time I'm in Singapore
5
I've been to the same outlet twice, & both visits were of very pleasant experience! The staffs would welcome you with open arms, & also they would do do suitable recommendations according to the number of patrons per table/ your taste and preference. There was once we requested a change of table and also to cancel a dish after we placed the order, and they were more than willing to help. & they would also check w customers if the food was okay at the end of the meal. Recommend the golden sand crab, Guinness pork ribs, and crab beehoon soup
4
Celebration of my sis Birthday at Uncle Leong. The food esp the chilly crab was yummy. The waiter ensure that our order is accurate by making an effort to repeat our dishes bef collecting payment at the end of the day. Great service!
4
Ordered their speciality dish crab Mee Hoon. Crab meat was fresh and sweet. The soup delicious and too
2
Quality service of staffs, however food quality was not up to standard. When comes to Uncle Leong Seafood, it should deliver as well as it has did before, however this is my first visit which disappointed me.
5
Not my first time dining at uncle Leong's! Their crabs are huge and fresh and value for money! The taste is also superb. The service is great (: will definitely be back
3
A reservation was made however when arrived at venue, still have to wait for an hour and after that food took 30mins to arrive and that was the first dish. If possible try to avoid dining over here during peak hours. Food was delicious though.
3
Food tend to be slightly salty. The crabs are huge in size of min 1kg. Chilli crab sauce is abit diluted. The spinach with mushroom is nice. Good for family gathering. Staff are very polite and attentive.
4
This place is worth the journey.You must book and it helps to go with at least four people so that you can really enjoy their amazing crab dishes.Wonderful Guinness ribs and spicy prawns with excellent Kang Kong preceded the sensational black pepper crab.The unique shimmering sand crab was also delicious.We had Taiwan beer which was fine but the only wine options are listed as red or white without further explanation.That aside, the staff are charming and helpful serving easily the best crab dishes in Singapore.Here's to Uncle Leong whoever he might be or have been!!
5
Was at Punggol Tebing Lane branch on a Monday with my parents. The service staff was very attentive to us, saw that my parents kept looking at the ceiling and one of the staff asked if we are too cold, and told his colleague to quickly turned off one of the air con. I was very happy with their service, even my dad commented on their good services. Will definitely come back again
4
Nowadays it is not easy to enjoy the best crab mee hoon soup in Mellben Seafood Ang Mor Kio. You have to queue long time (no reservation in weekend) and can't add orders. This Uncle Leong place is a good alternative (I heard it is actually franchise of Mellben). They accept reservation for tables before 6:30pm in weekend. The crab mee hoon soup tastes very close to the original Mellben. Plus it is along Punggol waterway, the settings are nicer than Mellben. So for the service
5
We dined at Uncle Leong Seafood (Tebing Lane) on 8 Feb. We wanted to order a salted egg crab but ordered a chili crab by accident. When the chili crab came and the mistake was highlighted, the staff graciously replaced it with a correct portion of salted egg crab without charge. Thank you for the great service and fresh seafood
5
This is my first time make reservation thru Chope. They're fast reply and will make reservation again thru Chope.
5
Reasonable price with good foods serving .nice ambience . Easy locate
A must to try their crabs. Worth going
5
Wonderful experience with the service crew! They initiated and asked us how was the taste etc. kind enough to help us change plates time to time. Keep it up! ;)
3
The food was gud.... Price also accepted... Decently price meal for decently average food... Serving size are gud... Look forward to coming here again...
4
Food is yummy! Staff are friendly and the ambience is good! Will surely come back to this restau soon!
3
Food is delicious and service is good. Only thing is the food is pricier as compared to other seafoid restaurants
5
It was really a pleasant place to dine in! With a team of very energetic and fast waiter and chef, you can be sure of very minimum wait for your dishes to be served.
4
The customer service part can be better, there are room for improvement like app reservations. I stated big table request and they intended to put me outdoor seating. In the end, we decided to sit inside with a smaller table. They can actually call us to check whether i wanted indoor or outdoo
1
Uncle leong seafood not worth the cost and food don't taste good at all. best part, after eating uncle leong seafood i had been diarrhoea and fever for 4 days. suspect was the Crab that cost me sick. for the price is totally not worth it. crab not fresh, even my grandma and grandpa say it smells and taste bad. there are more better seafood restaurant out there. i fully don't recommend uncle leong seafood
5
Staff is very friendly and gave good recommendation. The creamy crab is worth the trip there. Our intention was only to eat chili crab and as the size of crab was small, staff recommended one small chili and one small creamy crab. Very good recommendation of having a male and female crab! Though the location is secluded, it is next to the park connector and we took a nice stroll after dinner.
5
The waiting time for the food is quite fast. They are very attentive to our needs.
Will definitely come back for more.
5
Friendly, thoughtful and honest staff and service. They value your business by giving all customers excellent service experience, that is hard to find in Singapore nowadays.
4
Price is moderate, and it is always bustling with family so expect it to be very crowded. All in all the food quality is fairly decent, the black pepper crabs are a must to have!
3
Service is good.
Salted egg crab is no.
Creamy butter crab is alright but too sweet. Beehoon crab is nice!! Overall crab is very fresh!! The place was a bit too noisy. Sitting outside is too humid to enjoy fully.
3
The table space for 5 pax is quite small. Ordered few crabs, food keep coming up but our table is too small to occupy so much food
Food is nice
5
The food was excellent as usual, and the service provided by the staff was warm and professional. Will be back again!
4
Good food and even better service. Go early (6plus) so that it's not crowded and food is served fast.
5
Friendly staff. Delicious food. Prices affordable. Must eat Is the crab beehoon soup. One bowl is not enough. Sweet and fresh crab meat.
5
Reservation was easy and there are even reminder calls/email on the reservation timing too.
Food was good, staffs were friendly and service was good.
4
Everything was really good, the service, the food, except the crap's sauce (chilli crap) which was a tad starchy to our liking. Otherwise, the staff were really attentive and quick to reach you. Its the best service I have ever had in a seafood restaurant so far.
4
Came here for seafood recommended by friends and I did not regret it.
Their salted egg yolk crabs was heavenly!
Location wise is a bit remote in Punggol but once you got there you realize many families spending time at that area.
4
Essentially patronised by locals this seafood restaurant is not easy to locate.
But it is worth the effort as both food and staff were great! Pricing is reasonable and I would recommend the salted egg crab! Simply divine!
5
My family and I agreed that the service was beyond expectation, food was finger licking good and reasonably priced! We will be back soon!
5
Good food especially the crabs. Yam paste is alittle dry n tough but overall is good. The vouchers is worth to purchase.
1
Food was a bit tasteless and not as good as expected and also not as good as similar places offer, but the Price is simliar to the other places,..... Location along the water front is nice
3
I requested for Sri lankan crab but the service staff said that Sri Lankan and Indonesian crabs were mixed so they cannot guarantee. Food was ok but not worth the cost. Service in general is good.
4
The new crab dish was fantastic- Italian creamy sauce. Chilli crab was a little spicy. The rest of the dishes was nice too. Overall bill was quite expensive as compared to normal Tze char stall.
5
As usual we go for our crabs as the area is v nice by the park and relaxing... Long q but the service is really still up to standard. Friendly and they ensure at paying they ask customer on feedback on the food today. If there is bad feedback I hope they will really note it down and improve. But if there are good reviews I hope they will tell the chef and keep up the great skills! Try their butter crab with fried buns to dip. Signature hor fun and even their dessert longan with sea coconut to end the meal.
4
I was visiting a friend's house and tried to have early dinner here. Surprisingly the foods here were very good. Service very prompt and good. Very good crabs and Yang Chow fried rice too. Next time I'll try their omelette, fried noodle and tofu dishes, so many people ordered it that night
2
Got the Yangzhou fried rice, Thai chicken fillet and mini hotpot tofu.Fried rice was rather oily but tasty, but it didn't have any fragrance. For $10 it's ok.Chicken fillet was really small but that was the best dish in terms of flavour and presentation.Tofu was a no go and salty.Service was excellentWent for the crab but 1kg for $70 which was more expensive than Long beach. For a suburb restaurant, it was over priced.Food had a lot of msg, was very thirsty after and lasted the rest of the night.Water is charged at 50 cent
5
First time at Punggol outlet, previously went to the Jurong east outlet. The quality of the seafood is always fresh, price was reasonable as well.
5
Had the chilli crab and yangzhou fried rice.
Crab was very fresh and chilli crab sauce was delicious!
5
Excellent services and freshest seafood restaurant. Very surprised that they called to remind me of the timing and asking me if I need a baby chair as my baby is going too. Very highly recommended to everyone for the food and friendly service .
4
Delicious crab cooked with a bee hoon soup, yummy salted egg prawn and giant chives. Service is pretty good too.
4
Very flexible with their set meals, I was allowed to change my dishes to another dish of the same value or simply top up. Celebrated my dad's birthday there and all of us enjoyed ourselves alot.
4
Nice environment & ambience next to the waterway. Food was excellent especially the crab dishes. Service staff was very friendly and approachable. Made good recommendations:)
4
The food was of good quality, and the staff who took our order have us suitable recommendation to sit or group size. Also, The staff were always ready to handle our multiple requests, and they were prompt too!
5
The food was delicious, service friendly and ambience conducive. We will definitely dine there again in the near future - Fathers' Day, etc.
5
Their service is as always impeccable and they always serve with a smile. If you like crab, you cannot go wrong coming to this restaurant. You will be amazed by the wide variety of crab dishes. The crab is fresh and the flesh is succulent.
1
Visited this outlet on 15 Jul 2016 for dinner. Ordered Chilli Crab, Salted Egg Prawns, Sambal Kang Kong and Seafood Fried Rice. The crab and the prawns were not fresh. The chilli crab sauce tasted awful too. My hubby and i had diarrhea for 3 times. Definitely not recommend and will never visit again
5
Always loved the food and service at Uncle Leong. Service is always fast and attentive. Crabs are always good, and do try the Signature Hor Fun.
5
confirmation call prior the dinner and has been advised about their crab quality due to their supplier. great to get information before making decision on the dishes, overall a great place for family and friends. will be visiting again.
5
Got the table and the Serving of foods all very fast. The place is very clean too there. The pricing abit too expensive
4
Good food. Nice crab and friendly service and value for money. the location "punggol" is a bit far for tourist and hard to find.
4
Food is good, value for money. Ambient is relaxing and peaceful by the Punggol Waterfront
Especially like the signature horfun, guiness pork ribs and crab bee hoon
3
Went there for a farewell dinner with colleagues and bosses. Food and drinks arrived promptly, portion was okay. Food was a little salty and the service was not very attentive/patient as they did not wait for us to finish our orders and they walked off. End up we need to keep calling them back which cause frustration on both parties. Crab Bee Hoon is a little overrated
4
Although their signature dish is the shimmery crab, we didn't think it was up to standard. Didn't really have very fragrant taste. However, their crab bee hoon was really very good. The soup was heavenly!Service was outstanding. The staff were very alert and attentive.Price was on the high side even for dessert. We ordered yam paste. They don't serve individual serving, and the smallest size was $15 which was good for 4 pax.
4
Genuine and sincere service from the entire crew. So easy to catch their eyes even when it was bustling peak dinner hours. Several staff asked for our feedback on the food and if the portions were alright as a continuation of our earlier discussion on the portion size to order.May want to reduce the noise level of indoor seating area w some soft furnishings to facilitate conversation
5
Great service and food. They called to confirm reservations and informed us that the supply of crabs were limited and the quality of meat might not be as good as usual. But! It turned out the meat was very good! And for 4 dishes (including the crab beehoon), we only spent 116
2
Have been to this outlet a few times. It was really good thus I brought my bf's family over, however, the last time round, the food quality was really bad, nearly tasteless. Service was not good too, plates were not served when food was here, until we asked for it. No utensil were given to us when crab was served. Initially, thought that their crab may not be as disappointing as their normal dishes, but everything was a huge disappointment. Not worth another visit again
4
We went with a group of big family and enjoyed the dinner. The service is good and we will eat there again
4
Food is gd, will definitely go again. However, service need to buck up.. Wish water was refillable..
5
Food - fantastic. The crab is always fresh and full of flesh
Service - immaculate. Always with a smile and the boss Jeff is always ready for feedback.
5
Was not here for a while. Tried the signature golden sand crab dish. It was unique n great. Made me want to eat more. Others dishes were good too. The place faced the waterway n dinning outside was a better experience for me. The service was very prompt. Would be back again
5
This place is a little bit out of the city center in Punggol area and by my big surprise, it was packed on Wednesday eve.Service was very friendly and efficient, food come out from kitchen in a good timing and what a food!!!! It was lovely lovely lovely!!! My Nr 1 dish was salted egg prawns and than rest was just a great supplement to tickle your taste buds! Ya and cold beer
4
Have been there many times and every time is a pleasant experience. This time we decided to try the creamy butter crabs, and they were meaty, juicy and simply delicious. We were also very impressed by the service, as the staff made the effort to check with us if we would like the crabs to be served with the rest of the dishes or later. Will be back for more!
5
The staff at the restaurant displayed a very customer focused attitude and made us feel at home by engaging in small chats. Food was delicious and affordable with the Chope discount. Staff even sent us off at the door when we left. Will definitely come back again
5
Ordered 2 medium Chilli crabs with 20 fried mantous, Sambal giant chives, spinach with 3eggs, and 3spices diced chicken! Overall taste was fantastic. Service wise is good even though the restaurant is full house. The Yam paste with gingko nuts is a good way to end off the Chinese meal.
5
I booked and call in to confirm booking. They were nice to respond fast, and accommodated to my request though I tried squeezing 15 into a 12-table seat. When we arrived and ordered our dishes, realised we over ordered so one waiter immediately asked kitchen to stop, and re-prepare as per our request. Food was out within 5 minutes, not to mention yummy!
4
We went as a big group in their Jurong branch to celebrate a birthday. The crabs lived up to all the hype, and the other seafood items, such as the prawns, abalone, steamed fish and scallops were all quite good. Good place to go to if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re out to celebrate an occasion with a big group and do not want to spend way too much for good food. We went a bit earlier for dinner on a Saturday night at 6:00 p.m. and we were the first customers. At around 7:00 p.m. the place was already packed
5
Staffs were very friendly and efficient. Staffs gave constructive suggestions in terms of food portion and flavour.
5
This is my second time I come here to have my dinner..
My family and friends all love it and will sure go back again.
5
Good atmosphere and friendly crews. They allowed me to change my table 3 times. As my guests find the first table too cramp, and second too cold. The crews didnt even complain or show signs of anger.
5
Here is quite far from everywhere but worth of trying. Their golden crap really kills you with its thick creamy sauce! Clay pot crap beehoon(they use thick and bouncy noodle!) is another great dish from them.
4
I enjoyed having dinner at Uncle Leong (punggol). The food is yummy and the staff there are friendly and helpful. I like the ambience of the restaurant coz is located near park, is relaxing.
4
Crab is nice. We love both crab noodle soup and butter crab. The soup is hope and delicious. But the cereal prawn abit too much powder and the squid is not crispy enough.
3
We reserve a table for dinner on a Sat night but was surprised to see that it was not crowded at all when we reached. We ordered crabs, prawns and pork ribs, etc and found the reason why. Every dish was just so so...nothing impressive... I think we can easily get such normal standard food from the neighbourhood coffeeshop

we visited the restaurant located in Jurong East. they have converted the ground level of a HDB block to a very pleasant place for a meal. staff are friendly and attentive. we ordered the golden sand crab and white pepper crab, plus fried rice, hor fun, guinness stout pork ribs and drinks.

They have never failed to disappoint me with the food. And unlike many of the seafood restaurants that has become very expensive, Uncle Leong manages to keep the prices affordable and the food consistently delicious. I also find the staff there amazing as everybody is smiling and friend even though it was packed to the brim. It seems to me that Uncle Leong must be a nice place to work in considering how happy the staff are. Happy staff + declicious food + affordable prices = happy customers.

First time at Uncle Leong left a good impression on me. The service was good, servers were attentive and helpful. Though servers may take slightly longer, probably due to the lack of helpers, they made sure we had an enjoyable time over there. My group of friends and I were celebrating Christmas over there. After dinner, we had a cake. Despite the queue outside, servers did not chase us out like some other restaurants would.Will definitely visit again!Thank you everybody who were working on 20 Dec! You guys are the best

Surprisingly, Contrary to some of the negative comments, I actually had a pleasant time here! My only qualm is that the bbq smoke from the prawn fishing next door was a little too strong at times.

Extremely easy to use and hassle free when making payment!
Purchase and Save your bucks if you can!
Why not!

Uncle Leong Seafood has wide selection of Crab dishes and all of them are extremely good. Other dishes are also cooked well.

No price listed on menu. The signature crab is good but expensive at $60 per kg. Food portion for large size is probably medium size of other seafood restaurant. Food on the saltish size. Service staff quite friendly. Water chargeable at 50 cent per cup.

Delicious Crabs with big juicy pincers. Crab was very fresh. Food is a little on the salty side. Shark Fin soup at $100 for a small bowl for 6 person was pricey

I have mixed feelings about this. Food was good, nothing about that, and service staff most accommodating except for 1 thing. We had to send back a bottle of red wine as it was totally off. Understandably perhaps not too many people order wine there, but I had overseas guests who like to drink wine. The bottle of red was off and I informed the staff. MC came back and said that if this wine was off then most likely also the replacement bottle ... I was a bit puzzled. So we said ok, and replaced it with beer.For 3 pax we had 1 soft drink, 1 still water, 1 beer and 1 bottle of house white wine. Foodwise: 1 Medium Chilli crab,1 plate spinach with preserved egg, 1 plate gold coast prawns and 1 special sauce deep fried garoupa. The bill came at $253. For the food i received an itemised bill (in Chinese). The drinks tab was not there. Redoing the prices, I suspect the bottle of red has been charged. If so, not nice.....

Staff was very friendly and came over to assist us immediately when needed.
Staff even suggested serving the dishes at a slower speed as one of the guest have not arrived yet.
Food served was delicious and all of us enjoyed it very much!

They have varieties of Crab cooking and all of them are very good taste as has been coming to try all during the many years.
3
The food was rather average and pricey. The good thing was the staff were rather attentive and the overall service quality was satisfactory.
4
nice food with reasonable price. The staffs are helpful and friendly. We bought the chope vouchers , and we can claimed it without any issues
4
Very fresh, flavorful, and relaxed. The Tom Yum soup was my favorite dish overall. I will dine here again.

THis is the 1st time we visit this outlet.service need to improve. never change the serving plate for the whole dinner.
4
I ordered a salted egg crabs and it was different from the one i usually eat. It's my third visit there and the food never fails. Worth the visit although it can be quite pricey and the staff were very patient by explaining to us that the crab might stick to the shell because of the frying process. Definitely a must try if you have spare budget for a good crab meal. The beehoon soup is always good

I had a guest from out of town and we were recommended to try Uncle Leongs for the Black Pepper Crab. Unfortunately on arrival (although we had booked) we could only order 1 crab (for a party of three) due to all other crabs being 'reserved' prior which was the sole purpose for going to this 'out of the way' location. Also when clearing the table the waiter was not paying attention and managed to pour Black Pepper Crab source all over my guest's shirt and pants. Just careless. Food was good however we really needed to know of the crab 'shortage'.
4
My first visit to the restaurant and despite the restaurant being crowded, staff were very efficient and friendly. Will definitely be back! A small drawback is that the food can be a little too salty, but staff have clarified that they are able to make the necessary change upon request
4
We went there for a late dinner and it was not crowded. Decided to sit inside as there was air con. We ordered the fried rice and the fried bee hoon. Both dishes were nice and the portion was huge even though we ordered the small. Prices are higher than the seafood places you go to at coffee shops as it's a restaurant. One thing to note is that the prices are not stated in the menu for the dishes so you may wish to check with the waiters about the price before ordering.

Better to have the " Price" on all the items inside the menu.
Example : S $8 / M $10 / L $12
At least customer can understand the cost . Thanks.

Our friends in Singapore took us to this local, casual restaurant. We enjoyed the most delicious chili crab and butter crab dishes.

The service staff were friendly and attentive despite a queue and a full house. Food is superb. Prices are expected of such kind of food in such environment.

Huge crabs, cooked to perfection,great service, relaxed atmosphere...even fishing for fun. Go out of your way and have a super time.

Ok, let me start by stating the obvious, when you want quality stuff be prepared to pay.Having said that, Uncle Leong is in my opinion very value for money.I have been to the Tebing Lane outlet on many, many occasions both for dining in and take-away.Must order items are of course their Chili Crab, the Butter Milk Crab is also my all time favourite, the black pepper crabs, their signature hor-fun as well as the fried mantous.Not only are the food nice, the staff are also very attentive and prompt with their service.My only gripe is probably the slightly longer waiting time during peak hours but I am sure it is to ensure that every dish is cooked to perfection.And trust me that the wait is definitely worthy

My first visit to this outlet since they shifted form Ang Mo Kio couple of years back. It's a nice spacious environment, overlooking the Punggol waterway . The crab is big and fantastic as usual. I think it's a very ideal location for business dinner, if your guest is keen in getting their hands dirty to try some delicious crabs. Much more comfortable than at a HDB void deck that's crowded and crampy.

This restaurant serves the absolute best Crab Bee Hoon in Singapore. Such great presentation of the dish too! Ask for female crab if you enjoy luscious orange roe.I also tried the Chilli Crab, Coffee Pork Ribs and Cereal Prawns which did not disappoint.The only complaint I have is that the menu did not state the prices which made deciding what to order a little bit of a hassle.Note: Uncle Leong and Melben are both owned by the same family. Also, check out the adorable pet rainbow crabs in store

We arrived with 3 adults and 2 teenagers at the Punggol branch, and were received swiftly seated and equipped with menus. There are set menus (you pick from a limited list of signature dishes) and a la carte. The latter doesn't contain any prices because the fish and the crab goes by weight; so you pick, have it weighed, and then hear the financial verdict. You can always adjust to your budget with that information, and before everything goes into the pan.There are several tanks with live crabs, in the sizes small, medium, and large. We had 2 medium ones which was plenty for the 5 of us. On top of the 2 creamy butter crabs, we had golden shrimp, bean curd with meat, spinach with egg, rice, 2 rounds of soft drinks, and 1 big bottle of Taiwan beer; it all added up to 232,40 SGD. The quality of the crab was superb and we kept dipping the bread in the sauce way after the crabs themselves were reduced to a pile of empty shells and legs. The shrimp was coated in fine-grained cereal and equally yummy while the bean curd (tofu) was tasty and kept warm on a little stove. The spinach with eggs added further flavor to the combination.Seating is either interior (with A/C) or on the terrace (ceiling fans). Given the proximity of the canal, mosquitos can be an issue, so we choose to sit inside. The spacious and newly build surroundings are, well, "crabby", with picture and crabs decorating the place but without making it tacky or crammed. Service was prompt throughout our entire meal (we ate for the best part of 2 hours) and one can pay with all major cards. Orders below 50 SGD need to be paid cash. Next to the restaurant is a series of shrimp ponds where you (the kids?) can catch a few of their own while further down the street and along the waterway, there are several other places for a digestive or a pre-dinner drink

Had dinner with a couple of my friends, order 2 crabs , a fish, and a couple of other dishes. Service was prompt and good. Staff were friendly too.Crabs were big and juicy! Its was fantastic! Anyway we tried their shimmering sand crab and chilli crab as recommended! Fish was fresh and goes well with fried chye poh and soya sauce.The rest of the dishes were alright. Not the best but still better than alot of average restaurant out there.Will still visit them again when time and $$ allow!!

Had a dinner celebration on 5th April @ Punggol branch. We had to place the order before we were seated. There is no price information on the menu. How odd?! As there were 11 of us, we ordered large for all the dishes. We had 2 types of crabs dishes - chilli crab and white pepper crabs. The crab meats werent firm. Someone commented that my helper can cook better crabs using Tai Sing Chilli Sauce. I had to agree with them. The 2 vegetables dishes came in huge portions but not much flavour. The salted peper prawns were a tad dry. The Guniness pork ribs were really salty and coated with a thick sauce. Their signature deep fried beancurb were tasteless. I was surprised their 3-cup chicken dish came in small chicken dices. We came here despite hearing negative reviews from our family friends. We didnt even post any pictures on our media network because we were embarrassed we came despite all the warnings from our family friends. We did however like the fried mee fen which was quite good. We have since set a date to enjoy 5kgs of crabs to be cooked by our helper using Tai Sing chilli sauce
