Halal chinese food which is cooked in an authentic chinese style. Prices are reasonable. The 9 course chinese new year set meal for 10 was $428. Only thing is that location is not accessible. Neither near train station nor town centre.

The crab was fresh, Kang kong and hor fun had a good wok hei. Standard as drop a little with the ingredient, carbonated prawns, chilli crab sauce and hot plate tofu with less egg and the usual expensive fried man Tou.

The food here is quite nice and it is a halal restaurant however after their renovation the price of their food increase. On weekend it is very crowded be prepared to wait for a seat. The most popular dish is curry fish head. The fish is very fresh and the curry is good. The drinks are more expensive compared to the food court or coffee shop (between 70 centre to one dollar) so just ask for water instead

Brought a group of 10 family members here for dinner. We had made reservation before heading down. When we arrived, the table was already ready for us. I was rather apprehensive to try dining here at first, as I was reading the reviews on their FB page. Some indicated bad service and food was so-so. BUT, I am glad I went there myself to experience it! :) Service was gooooood (from 3 different servers). Our dishes arrived rather fast and it was piping hot. My family and I enjoyed our dinner greatly!We ordered a few dishes.Curry Fish head: 10/10Sweet & Sour Fish: 10/10Beansprouts with salted fish: 9/10Salted Egg Chicken: 9/10Oats Prawns: 10/10 (the oats were so goood!!!)Chye Poh Omelette: 9/10Hongkong Kailan with Beef: 7/10 (this was our least fav dish. but they are not to be blamed cos the Kailan was the Hongkong Kailan. It was bigger. We assumed it to be like baby kailan. But the oyster sauce and beef on it were good!)Spent a total of abt $180 for the above orders including white rice and rounds of drinks. The dishes ordered were all in large sizing. Very value for money! I will be back there again for sure. Sometimes, FB review can be deceiving hehe. I would strongly adv you to try it out yourself. Where service is concerned, I am believer in, if you are a good customer, you will definitely get good service in return. Haha. Or i am just plain lucky! :

Had the salted egg crab, prawns, HK Kai Lan with Oyster Sauce and rice, which was filling for two persons. Delicious but pricey, which is expected of seafood. It might be more economical if more dishes were shared with a larger group.The place is at the void deck of HDB flats though so it might be difficult to find (especially at night) but google maps could overcome that for you.

Cheap price for quality food!! If you go Dempsey or Holland V or Star vista, you are paying double the price for ambience but lousy food...A-poh is located in the heartland, not so beautifully located but food is sooo good!!! My European friends have only praises for the food that I order for them...If you are a foreigner, try this dishes which my friend says its delicious: Either Pandan chicken or claypot chicken, oat sotong, vegaetable kangkong (maybe spicy...just try this few dishes and you will agree with me! We had our dinner at Clementi...there are 2-3 branches in total if im not wrong..
