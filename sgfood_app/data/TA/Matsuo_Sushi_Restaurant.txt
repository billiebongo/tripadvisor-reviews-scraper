Small Japanese restaurant in Novena, not far from United Square. Not very crowded when we went. The set is not cheap but very value for money. Starters are extremely tasty, sashimi is great and the sushi is nice too. Staff is very friendly.

Nice place! Sashimi is fresh, service staffs are very attentive. Had a good time here. Will return again. Set lunch is definitely cheaper then dinner.

A surprise to us. We bumped into this small restaurant when we walked around Novena, the food is very nice. Atmosphere is good.
Enjoy it and will visit again:)

The restaurant served value-for-money lunch sets, and the quality is comparable to the excellent meals I had in Japan!

This is my favourite lunch place and my top choice when I've any special meetings happening. Highly recommended and I go back every 2 months. üëç

The food quality is very good. Portion is generous! Authentic! I will definitely go back! Thank you!

This has been my go-to for authentic Japanese food for years. Do make sure you book a table in advance! They have limited seating and its always full-house ever since my first visit to Matuso. The food here tastes like it just came from the sea! It's a great hidden gem that you should definitely try out for yourself!

Seems like the restaurant only favours Japanese. Wants to charge if we request for separate tempura from the udon... so ridiculous. Restaurant has only 2 tables that's occupied, yet staff insist that my company of friends must sit next to a occupied table. The senior waitress have an especially poor attitude and sulky face. The food may be good but the service sucks big time. I can spend my money elsewhere than put up with the kind of service... as a customer, I don't feel treated as a customer, more like I owe them money. Give this place a miss

Swap the shirt and ties and you know the weekend is here. The atmosphere changes from salaried Japanese businessmen and office crowd to families and expats living around. Thing that doesn't change is still the excellent sushi and chirashi bowls which are excellent value and quality.

had the 488 omakase set. Sashimi was beautiful. Quantity of food was very good. However none of the food came in order and came Chinese style - ie all at once in random order .this is what I mean by finesse
4
The restaurant is a bit small and crowded especially during lunch time so we have to go there earlier to get the seats. Their sashimi are fresh and their grilled eel are the best that I tried so many Japanese Restaurants so far.
5
Always a treat to eat here because they do serve fine food with fresh and yummy sashimi/ sushi. Always ask for omakase and chef Matsuo will always deliver! Yum yum yum...

Set lunch ($18) : Unadon - it comes with salmon sashimi, grilled unagi on rice, miso soup, fruits and teaSaba Shioyaki set ($15) : rice, grilled saba, soup, fruits and teaMatsuzushi Bento ($27) : tempura (vege and prawns), 3-4 kinds of sashimi, California maki, 5 pieces of nigiri sushi, soup, fruits, chawanmushi and teaValue for money

Good value. Would recommend their lunch bentos for a mid price range treat to self. Had the unagi lunch set for around $20 plus plus. Nicely done. Full of flavour. Lunch is always crowded though. So do not expect a nice quiet sit down at lunch. Have not tried their omakase dinners though.

Chanced upon this hidden gem in the old fashioned Goldhill plaza. Hardly an inviting restaurant behind a wooden frontage, it's worth seeking out for the set lunches. Very reasonably priced, starting from S$15-25, my Colleague and I were surprised by the freshness and quality of the bento box. Including piping hot and crisp tempura, about 6 pieces of sushi and 6 gorgeous plump sashimi. Look at the photo and salivate

We have been here twice before, but each time, Chef Matsuo amazes us with not just the traditional, but something more. We were tired and wanted a relaxing sushi, sashimi dinner. Chef Matsuo welcomed us, as always in his hospitable style. We left it to him and he kept giving orders to his staff and also he himself prepared the finest sashimi and sushi
4
The sushi is really fresh and Matsuo is true to the art. Having eaten at more upmarket restaurants around the region, this place has no airs and just focusses on good seafood.We were lucky he had some good Kinki which was grilled to perfection. Bravo chef !

We got the 90‡∏¢‡∏ö corner spot at the sushi bar so the four of us could chat, share and enjoy.Leave it to the Chef and he fixes it to your liking.Assorted (PLENTY) sashimi and sushi, and fried salty fish kept coming as we cleaned up everything. Like always fresh fruit was offered to calm us down
5
At the sushi bar, Hiroyuki Matsuo the owner was very busy, but gave us his best attention with ease and made us feel at home.Service was exceptional and the best overall experience I have had outside Japan. Sashimi of the best fish anyone can serve - Toro Kampachi, Tai Hirame; and Kampachi Kama Shioyaki, preparations were outstanding. Fish flown in from Japan, maintained fresh and mouthwatering good.We were stuffed to our back teeth with excellent traditional Japanese food
