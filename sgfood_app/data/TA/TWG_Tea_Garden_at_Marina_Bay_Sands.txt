This was our second visit to the tea garden - having been there 3 years previously.
Hundreds of blends of teas to choose from whilst sat in opulent surroundings. Orchids all around.
World class macaroons - S$2 each.
Luscious sorbet!
5
Beautiful food and beautiful service. The tea is perfect. This experience is a must for Singapore and it’s culinary experiences
5
We enjoyed a light late lunch, with a lovely iced Christmas tea alongside. The tables are surrounded by beautiful fresh orchid flowers, simply stunning. Even though you are in a bustling shopping complex, its a lovely way to rest the feet and refresh oneself.

TWG tea is one of the best in the world. I love buying it and bringing tea presents to my friends in Germany.
5
Place and ambience is great. Every thing is nice there. Variety of teas to choose from. I believe all tea is nice. Quite pricey but the price is worth for the quality. Would come back to chill and relax there.

My family and I have been going to TWG fairly regularly, we enjoy their food, tea, pastries and the atmosphere. The food is interesting and infused with tea, well done and has nice sides. Service has always been impeccable, and it was always a good experience eating with them.However, today when we went to dine with them again, we were appalled to discover that they had a new policy: every diner must order a beverage. We had already ordered a main course each, but were told that to eat here, we had to order a pot of tea or beverage each. Neither of us wanted something to drink, we just simply wanted to have a nice lunch meal at TWG. We hope they would review their policy because we would like to be able to dine here again without being forced to order a beverage each in addition to a main course
5
I have been a TWG customer for years and love the TWG teas. French Earl Grey is my personal favourite. Great place to enjoy teas from all over the world. Excellent cakes and the restaurant is amazing too. Reservations are a must. Must visit place when in Singapore
1
We were there on new year eve, on the Twg on the B1 floor. For a pricey restuarant you kinda expect a good service but tonight some of your waiters just look oh so disinterest. One time when we were ordering a menu and it not available instead of suggesting something else that available on the menu he just ran away in a crude manner. So when our food were delivered to the table and there was neither plate or cutlery or even napkin were provided and have to ask for it. Might as well just doing our own serf-service. Will never go back to any Twg ever again since other branches like the one in Siam paragon, Bangkok also provide bad service.

Came here as a group of five for some mid morning tea time!If your into teas this place has hundreds of them. Not the cheapest place, lovely decor & ambience. However, the service was a little slow & our selections did not come out together. 20 minutes apart! Which is not acceptable for a high quality establishment
5
We went as a couple on Christmas Eve for dinner, and I must say that we were impressed with the level of service and the quality of food. Lucky for us, we got the corner table, which was furthest away from the entrance, and we were pleased with it.The service provided was impeccable, from welcoming you with gracious greetings, showing you to your seats, and pulling out the chairs for you. We had the Farmhouse Eggs, Croque Salmon, Chocolate Earl Grey Ice Cream, Strawberry Tea and Earl Grey Buddha tea. The waiting time for the food was relatively short considering how busy the restaurant was. The food tastes great, and we were pleased with our dining experience. Highly recommended! Ask for the corner seat if possible, you will enjoy it

Enjoy the view of surrounding marina bay sands mall with a pot of hot tea. Try their dessert and ice cream
4
Had a meeting here. Nice place, even tough they are often full but a good meeting place as it is not too noisy.
3
I would say overrated compared to other places visited. We ordered scones and pain au chocolate for one of the children in our party. We were told that the last pain would be kept for our order. But alas not! Child was left to order something else. No hot chocolates either. Scones served without a smile and no clotted cream just whipped cream. Being English- spoilt the experience! Customer experience would stop my recommendation to others.
2
Be prepared to do self-service at this restaurant. I couldnâ€™t get the staff to refill the pot of tea with hot water that I have to bring the pot to the counter myself. This is the kind of service I received at this outlet. So, be mentally prepared
5
Having a early lunch with friend chitchatting with nice food & nice tea.I ordered a roasted chicken & friend ordered the duck. Both were tasted. Each person must order a tea pot, no tea port sharing is allowed. A very tasty and hot bun (I think it was a green tea bun) were served together with the main course. Waiter would introduce type of tea to go with your meal. I had a lavender breakfast tea, very mild taste, I like it very much. The price is quite standard for the bistro in Singapore, affordable with good services & good food & friendly helpful staffs. I am sure to come back again...
4
Book a Show and Dine Package - The Sound of Music. Reach the restaurant at 11am, Show is 1pm.2 Choice of Mains, Teas and wide a variety of cakes from the cake trolley.We chose Egg Benedict, Hot Tea and cake.It were very delicious and filling. We had a good brunch at chat before the show.Enjoyable later morning meal
4
I been to this restaurant with my family. We had a dinner at this authentic restaurant after searching for places to eat at Marina Bay. This place offers really good quality tea. I ordered White House Tea which is very nice. The food and drinks was served fast. The restaurant workers were very friendly and nice.Although most of the food at this place is quite pricey but it is still a good choice for those who wants to enjoy fine dining
4
I was lucky to be offered a table quickly without having to wait in the queue. The dishes was undeniably good. The restaurant has a lovely ambience with indoor and outdoor seatings. The outdoor seatings are located in the atrium. The service staff was very accommodating and treated me and my guest well.Well done and keep up the good service
1
This place looks very inviting and beautifully packaged for an afternoon tea, but the service standards are extremely appalling, I think the service charge should not be made mandatory if they expect customers to put up with slow waiters. After showing me to my seat, the waiter just piled a whole lot of menus on the table and walked off. Tried to gesture for attention multiple times but was ignored. Same goes for end of meal, after clearing the table, they do not bring the bill even after being asked for that, and withheld my credit card for 15 minutes at the counter - it was just left there and nobody was accountable for it. Very impersonal and inattentive service, and very slow for Singapore standards. I would not recommend this place unless you can deal with the slow service and being ignored
5
I have walked past this restaurant on many occasions and always thought this was just a place to be seen and for taking selfies, given the beautiful and central setting. I never thought that the food & beverages here can be taken seriously.Our family of 2 adults & 1 kid had lunch there yesterday and were very pleasantly surprised. Everything we ate was really very good. The lobster salad, the squid ink pasta, the wagyu meatball linguine, and the hot pot of Garden Party, were all excellent.The dining experience was also visually very unique and enjoyable with the nostalgic grand old English feel, with the TWG logo proudly but nicely stamped on every fine and shiny piece of cutlery, crockery, and linens.The service staff were busy and swift as it was lunch time and there was a queue waiting outside. But the staff remained attentive and friendly. We chatted with Dipak who attended to us, and I was impressed that he was sensitive to my liking for my tea to be in a hot teapot instead of a chilled tall glass, and quickly replaced it without me asking. Dipak was very professional and charming too.Thank you for the great food and the lovely service. We'll be back soon
5
Wow a really big selection of teas from around the world, and delightful snacks and deserts, very classy, fine chinaware, silverware and table-clothes, staff were very helpful and courteous. Perfect place for High Tea
5
Exquisite, delightful and have a touch of class restaurant for your high-end tea and rich desserts. A fairly expensive treat.
4
The design of the TWG tea garden at MBS is very nice. And the service is also quite good. The price is a bit expensive, the afternoon tea set is very tasty.
5
Great value for money, very decently priced, try the Nicolas salad and egg Benedict was one of the best ever tried, I almost ordered second portion because of how delicious it was, also efficient service and nice atmosphere in the mall ground floor.
5
We visited the TWG restaurant at MBS a few weeks ago and just only had the time to write this review.We patronized the restaurant near the MRT station. The interior deco simply shouted opulence and splendor - the magnificence of imperial France. Our server, if I could remember correctly was John. He was very polite and efficient and had great product knowledge. We asked him to recommend tea and he managed to derive one tea out of the hundreds available. We settled for Happy Birthday Tea, which was sweet, aromatic and very pleasant.For the dishes we had lasagna which was really one of the best I had - it did not taste pre made or anything. We also had the mushroom soup with croutons. In addition we had some macarons which were really tasty and value for money.All in all it was an A+ experience, the tea was always up to standard as was the food. Service and ambience was impressive. We had a wonderful lunch that day
5
Came here with colleagues- a classy way to finish off some deadlines and deal with stress. They have a wide range of tea- love the booklet which explains everything. Nice teapot etc Really like the chocolate mint truffle tea- wish the teapot could be bigger. Nice decoration of the place.....friendly staff ( why are they all men?
3
Came into the outlet with some expectation, with the quality damask linen table cloth, and silverware, fine chinaware. Good selection of tea around the world, services is fine, but the food was really let me down, ordered a duck dishes, presentation wise is ok, but the meat is really dry, and the skin was a bit burnt that make it taste bitterness, sauce and the beans was not very tasty. The Mille-feuilles that my wife ordered look nice in presentation, but taste terrible, the pastry itself is soggy, is like keeping there for sometimes already, all leftover from previous day. Chocolate dome is rich, but a bit hard. Only compliments for this place other than the teas, the macaroon is great, my kids favorite. pricing wise is ok for Singapore standard, not too expensive for the kind of set up
5
Treat yourself to one of their many, many teas - we had a blue one and a yellow one - all nicely served and with sweet or savoury food (we had sandwiches, beautifully presented). Not cheap, as you are surrounded by designer shops (Tiffany etc) and in the area where the MBS hotel is. But it is an oasis if you are just exhausted by the heat and humidity outside, as we were, as UK tourists, on our first couple of days
4
First time visiting Singapore and staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, I decided to visit the amazing shopping mall “The Shoppes” just across the street from the hotel. For lunch I decided to try (totally at random) this small, “open garden” (i.e., open in the shopping mall concept restaurant called “1837 TWG Tea”. When I read the menu, I was intrigued by the restaurant’s statement that ALL their dishes were infused, mixed, etc. with many different types of teas. I was not disappointed: the experience turned out to be very interesting and very different than the usual comments such as “…the steak was cooked to perfection…” or “ …the pasta was cooked just right, real “al dente”…”. The food, although very good, is almost secondary (with the exception of dessert – more on that later)– it is the “Teas” that are the focus of attention. First of all, the tea menu must contain, oh, I’d say, some 200 different types of teas, with a particular preference for an incredible number of darjeeling teas…secondly, the small teapot that is brought to your table will range from $10 (Singaporean dollars – about US$8) to $30! I ended up ordering the mushroom soup (absolutely delicious), a Thai prawn salad (also very tasty) and then came probably one of the top 3 desserts that I have had in my life - the Aukura Vacherin – described in the restaurant's menu as “ Vanilla Bourbon Tea ice cream and Sakura!Sakura! [sic] Tea sorbet encased in a meringue topped with fresh berries and raspberry coulis”. I mean, this was not “from good to great”, this was “from good to out of this world” - this dessert should be on everyone’s bucket list. For teas, I had the darjeeling “orange” ($21!) – very light, perfect to accompany the soup and the salad – and then a stronger, darker Assam (ONLY $16) to conclude the meal. Service was attentive but a bit on the slow side, which did not bother me but could be a problem if you are on a tight budget. Definitely recommend it (as long as you like tea!)
5
We stopped for a breather and a cuppa here on our day at the mall at Marina Bay Sands.Vast choice of teas available. Great range of cakes. Plus a good menu to boot. Service was good and the place tea very busy. Certainly a really good cup of tea. But not the cheapest place for a break
5
Great place if you are at MBS to chat and catch up. Has some delicious tea along with some wonderful scones and pastries. Servers were very attentive and definitely recommend.
5
An excellent stop to refresh with pastries and tea, served in very upmarket surroundings. Everything was well presented and very tasty. Recommended.
3
Let's be honest you're paying for the tea menu and preparation time. Lovely spot to stop for a cuppa. Food isn't great- scones were dry. A welcome relaxing stop amidst all the shopping. Have been a couple of times now - I'd suggest just having a tea and macaron.
5
Had to try TWG as I'd heard a lot about it and I was truly not disappointed. The bone china and emblazoned cutlery gave it a touch of class. The teas themselves were excellent and many to choose from , from around the world. We had the macaroons with our teas which came infused in pots. Worth the wait
2
Had a light lunch with kids at this beautiful restaurant. There were many waiters who seem to cluster around. The waiter was keen to recommend for the most expensive tea selections and was quick to point out that the pot of tea does not contain much tea. Thus indicating that each person should have their own pot and not share. As I was ordering for my kids i ignored the sales talk, I got a pot for my 2 kids (who like tea with milk and sugar and a cold drink for myself). Later on requested for some hot water in the pot as the boys were finishing their meal, and was told that they will only add hot water and there will be no taste, I realised that there were not tea bag or tea leaves in the pot after they added the hot water. Or perhaps they brewed the tea and only put the tea into the pot without the bag or leaves. Anyway, every measure seem to be taken to ensure you buy more. Well, since we have stepped into this restaurant, I presume all customers are ready to pay a price since it is at a premium restaurant and at a premium location, but to make the customer feel so uncomfortable. Plus we have to request for butter for the bread and so forth, seems like everything needs to be requested. You do not achieve old world charm with sales quota hungry staff... Lots of room for improvement. BTW the shop is not much better, lots of sales staff in clusters. You have to tell your order of macaroons to one staff who will tell the macaroon staff who are just in front of you. Rather redundant. Poor management
5
I love the tea from here, not only because this brand is established in Singapore but because of the vibe of the restaurant and the classy decoration used.I always come here for lunch or afternoon tea and they never disappoint. Waiters are well dressed and always very polite. They know a lot about their tea and always recommend nice teas to me
4
We treated ourselves to a Parisian tea which included some of the most delicious finger sandwiches and croque Monsieur with scones and tea jam.But best of all was the tea! An endless choice and great advice on what to choose, I don't like tea usually but tried an iced red tea which was delicious. You can buy the teas at shops around the city and in the airport.The price was reasonable and the atmosphere relaxed.The only reason I haven't give five stars is because the wait for food was pretty extreme.. almost 40 mins. For us this wasn't a problem but I could see some people getting fed up.Try this place.... a real treat
5
A to go place for a high tea and to catch up with friends. Good ambience and perfect service rendered by all your staff especially Daniel. We were taken aback by the incredible large selection of teas and daniel help us in our selection. Food was excellent. The macaroons are a must have. Highly recommended and will definitely be back.
4
Went with a couple of friends for high tea on a Friday afternoon,place was not too packed..our server Daniel was very helpful as we were pretty clueless with the selection of our teas.Food was great especially the macarons!Excellent choice for food coupled with good service & ambience:
4
TWG is about tea. So the chefs at TWG uses tea as a theme in their food. We ordered a set that includes beautiful warm scones , a mains ( we chose the salmon ,with green tea and coconut cream sauce and edamame ) and a dessert ( we chose the raspberry creme brûlée ). The other mains was the cod with mushroom and tea consommé. And of course we had the macarons - I was very pleased with the lemon bush tea flavor
4
They serve nice tea and cakes. Environment is relaxing where you can enjoy your tea while watching shoppers around the area.
4
after walking around all the mall area, we can stop at TWG to take a rest and take a cup of tea.
Nice place for tea time
5
The set up, the atmosphere and the decor are very particular and distinguished. Walking in to a place called the Tea Garden, one would not expect to get a lovely juicy mouthwatering steak. This is exactly what we got. A lovely charming place
4
This location carries more stock than the other location in the mall. My wife wanted to buy the Singapore Surprise blend. They had none in stock, so they made some up. A great service.
4
After shopping in Marina Bay Sands, this is one spot you must go as the embience is good and very relaxing and able to see the boat rowing over. Cakes and Tea is good
5
Nice ambience. Incredibly large selection of teas from all over the world. The sandwiches and scones were excellent quality! Service was also good.
4
With our family and needed a coffee and this was the perfect location. Service can be a bit slow but the drinks were very good.
5
A perfect way to have a perfect cup of tea and a light lunch or high tea. This is a first class establishment extremely clean and the food very appetising.
5
The Tea selection offered is fabulous. In fact after we had a cup of tea there we had to go to the TWG Shop to buy the tea we enjoyed at the Tea Garden.Great products and well executed.And yes it is expensive, but you get what you pay for
4
I'm a tea person, so TWG will never go wrong! I just love the kitchenware they use and the different many x10++ types of teas. Looking at the menu and spoilt with choices, the waiter asked me if I would prefer floral or fruit tea. And from there, he said he will select it for me. I totally let him to that. And the tea selection (forgot to ask him what's the name of the tea) was soo good! Freshness and something new Timmy tastebuds We had some of their mains and of course their Hi-Tea set. I think we were too hungry We ordered quite a bit. I wouldn't say that their food is so-so, I think it's one notch higher. But at TWG, the main focus is the tea. So if you're looking to have both ends of the world and you place higher priority on fabulous food, then you might have to think twice. Will I come again? Of course! The ambience and the different many x10++ types of teas will make me come back for more ☺️☺️☺
5
Great snacks, service and tea. Booze also surprisingly well priced for Singapore. You can sit and relax in the air con for a moment then shop shop shop!
4
What a nice way to take a break. After all the walking and the heat, we were beat and too tired to eat much. Tea and pastries hit the spot. Beautifully served.
4
Chose to dine here as the tables and setting looked really pretty. Didn't realise there was quite such an emphasis on tea - there was what seemed liked hundreds of different teas to choose from and would be a tea drinkers idea of heaven. Thankfully soft drinks were also available. We liked the look of the afternoon tea food selection but due to timing settled on main courses. These arrived quickly and at first seemed rather small but turned out to be quite filling and delicious
5
With the iLight happening around the Marina Bay and all sort of junk food. We decided to go for a proper sit down dinner in a cosy and comfortable environment. Dinner was delish and oh-so-pretty plus IG-worthy! The desserts never fail to impress - Singapore Surprise is the best. Had beef lasagna and the portions are right, service is 10/10! Keep up the good work TWG <3
5
This tea shop is so beautiful, and the tea garden is a must try. We ordered two pots of tea (you might want some help choosing cause the list is extensive!!!!) we also got the vanilla crepe cake and the apricot vanilla cake. Everything was delicious and so beautiful presented. I wish this was back home in Melbourne, I would be going there all the time!!!
5
There is no better way than to while away an afternoon at TWG. There are a number of branches in Singapore all with their fair share of young Asians taking photos of their sandwiches for Instagram. Don't let that put you off though, the sandwiches and the scones are seriously good and the choice of teas is so large that it comes with a book to explain them all. A must do whilst in Singapore
5
If tea is your thing, this is the place to be. I am in love with TWG, so I am always happy to spend time and enjoy a pot of tea. Though the service was good; nothing over the top. In the shop, the service went between too busy to get any help and then following me around - much to my annoyance. However, the tea trumps all - and it's amazing
5
They change their food menu pretty regularly, so there's always something new to try.We visit one a month, and have tried their duck, beef, sandwiches and pasta - all of which have been amazing on the palette. Their food is infused with different types of tea which really makes the flavours pop. Price, however, might be a factor of consideration. A main would cost you around $30-40 SGD. Highly recommended nevertheless
5
The tea set comes with 2 pots of tea which you can choose from the extensive tea menu, exquisite sandwiches, pastries, scones and cake. Service staff knows their stuff and sometimes one may feel like an English guy in a Paris restaurant. Anyhooo, nice ambience and great place for a dainty tete a tete.
3
Had a look at the menu and there looked to be quite a choice. It wasnt until we sat down that we realised tea was in Everything - the main meals, the vegetables, the desserts. I do not like tea so it probably wasnt the best place for me. However, the food was actually quite tasty, i had the lasagne and there was supposed to be tomatoes steeped in tea, but thankfully i couldnt taste it. My friend had the burger, which was apparently very good. The main meals are quite small, with the lasagne all i got was a dry roll. I wouldnt go back but as i say, if you like tea, its probably quite a nice place. Every time i looked up, the chap behind the bar was drinking tea, which didnt look very good, maybe he was tasting it, but if that was the case he should have done it out the way of visitors
5
An experience unlike any other. Some of the best teas in the world, an array to choose from like ive never seen. Beautifully hand crafted food, with amazing tea flavoured macarons and desserts.
5
Very nice atmosphere. Cool and comfortable even though it's not enclosed. The tea selection is truly impressive.
3
I went to TWG Tea Garden on 28 October 2016. It's very nice surrounding with gondolas it feels like I'm in little Venice. I ordered Ocean Crepe and mocktail it was delicious with nice and friendly staffs
4
Lots of variety for tea lovers. TWG also has an outlet at the airport if you wanted to buy and forgot to buy a pack for your loved ones. Teas are exceptions quality.
3
Rather pricey for High Tea. I am not a fan but my children loved it. My daughter is a lover of afternoon tea. The assorted finger sandwiches were good . The scones were quite good and if course there were hundreds of teas to pick from.
5
A nice example of an English style tea house with a large variety of specialty teas, accompanied by a small menu of fine foods infused with tea flavored ingredients. A nice place to pass the afternoon enjoying the atmosphere of Marina Bay Sand's shops.I had the Wagyu Beef Steak and Matcha dusted matchstick fries drizzled with truffle oil and my wife had the smoked salmon finger sandwich with a garden salad tossed in an 1837 tea flavored vinaigrette. We followed our entrees with a decadent chocolate truffle cake with earl grey infused chocolate ice cream and delicious vanilla bourbon tea infused chocolate crumbles
4
We had our dinner here before heading home from our holiday and it was a great end. Had a juicy burger and a nice steak with our tea. Also had some really nice macaroons for dessert. They were so nice that we asked them to bring more. Very relaxing and good staff. We had to go to the shop afterwards to buy the tea cause it was really nice. The only negative thing I have to say was that we waiting a little bit too long for our second teapot, but maybe that was due to the tea type we choose.
4
Whatever you may be doing at Marina Bay Sands, this is a great place for short or long breaks to rest your aching feet from all the walking. The location is strategic, at the confluence of major shopping corridors and attractions. The luxurious mall environment and sound of cascading water is delightfully relaxing and refreshing. The selection of teas and bites are as comprehensive as all other TWG locations. There's usually ample seating, with short waits during peak hours. The service staff are knowledgeable, attentive and really friendly. Definitely worth more visits when we're at MBS
3
Best teas in the world ? No. but great marketing and design makes you feel good and you cannot fault that. But prices reflect that premium. great for people who like to to have that parisian feel. Nice once but i cant justify paying three times or more for a cup of tea and some cucumber sandwiches no mater how nice the decor.
3
It's a tea garden, but my friend ordered iced coffee and they don't have it, which is acceptable. But when order tea for to go, they don't even have to go cup. Ummmm. The food is expensive compare to the total bill of SGD200 for lunch for 3 people. I understand it is in Marina Bay Sands, that's why.
4
Wonderful place to visit for a dessert and the portions are certainly large enough; couldn't finish mine. Good service.
5
We were looking for a restaurant to have a nice meal on our last night in Singapore and stumbled upon this one. But we were not disappointed.Firstly, our waiter was superb: friendly, helpful, attentive. The food on the menu was delicious.The main meal choices were western style. Desserts were exquisite, and many were infused with tea in one form or another. The macaroons were to die for!The highlight of this restaurant was the variety of teas. So many choices! I settled for the TWG signature tea - 1837 Black Tea. And I wasn't disappointed.I highly recommend this restaurant
1
Food is good but small portions, and very overpriced with odd set menu for brunch that's neither good for sharing nor good for an individual. Bigger problem is that they've figured a way to scam people out of discounts under the Amex Palate program by only offering a set menu for brunch while still including Sunday as a valid day for discounts. So basically they entice you with Sunday brunch but then don't give a discount because they don't offer a la carte menu on Sunday, and Thus no discount on the already inflated prices
5
Was treated to dessert here after a great dinner at Salt Grill. Service is top-notch as usual and we were allocated a table the moment we arrived.We were promptly served and the desserts came shortly. We stayed for a while and it was a blessing that this branch closes later.Will certainly be back
5
The famous tea experts are located in a central area of the Marina Bay Shoppes (they have a second location in the same complex). Lines can form during busy times of the day, such as tea time. Staff is slow to clear tables and seat new guests - no idea why since you would think moving guests in and out to be critical to their profit. Seating arrangements can be a bit cramped, but many tables have more privacy. Great for people watching as shoppers stroll by. Tea selection is simply dazzling - no way to navigate the list that goes on and on. Just ask the staff for a recommendation based on what you generally like. My wife ended up with a tea from Zimbabwe that she adored. Finger sandwiches with tea were tiny but delicious. The cakes outshine the scones here, but all are good. Enjoyable
5
We had brunch that was to die for!! The tea selection was unbelievable pages long and the cakes were mind blowing. It was a bit pricy for brunch over $100 but an amazing experience to have. It must be said that I had quite possibly the best salad in my life. They do high tea later in the day and as per service staff in Singapore they were faultless, polite and see hospitality as something to take pride in. Which made the experience so much more special
5
Every time I visit TWG Singapore it gives me a feeling of coming home. TWG is amazing, a little bit pricey but well worth every dollar. The range of teas is in the thousands and staff are so knowledgeable they are able to help you pick out the perfect tea that suits all your tastes. The menu whether it be lunch, snacks or dessert is all beautifully presented and tastes as good as it looks
5
I was very amazed that this shop is not from London, USA or anywhere else in Europe. It's actually a local brand! Serves decent western fare at affordable prices. Teas are really good and it's a good place to have high tea and chat with your friends.
4
Usual haunt for entertaining overseas friends or small catch up with old friends to enjoy a pot of nicely brewed good quality tea. Come with many options for dining at this place. Like breakfast options, desserts or main course available too. They also served different set menu at different branches. The plus of this particular location is the opening hours and it's ambience. .Service level more to be improved as the early batch of serving crew when it first started was very good.If u are a dessert lover, do try the desserts available at the showcase trolley. Highly recommended the earl grey jelly and its scone with cream. My favorite selections of tea is always the different earl grey types of teas. Recently had also tried out the tea meant for relaxation (dun quite remember the name) but the crew could recommend and explain what the tea smells like, they will even let u smell it if u are keen. Nice place for couples to spend a romantic time together n enjoy the courses of food n the desserts. If u like the tea u could also easily purchase the tea from its shop which is near the dining area.
4
Had a wagyu steak, was pretty good. Chinese serving staff was very polite though inexperience shows. Overall a nice lunch.
5
Service here is excellent. The location is beautiful - gorgeous orchids all around the circular area. Our tea was delicious and so was brunch. Very enjoyable. Had to go to the shop and buy some of the delicious tea we had during brunch.
4
Beautiful eating experience with the opportunity to drink from an unbeatable selection of teas. The staff are excellent - discrete, helpful and knowledgeable. The food is perfect for the setting. Plus you can buy the teas to take home - which is a bonus.
4
My 1st time at TWG today, and I was happy with their Wagyu Burger (cooked Medium) with its matchstick fries. The pasta was yummy too but sauce was bit heavy. Tea was special but not cheap. I had all 3 flavours of their ice-creams and they were all awesome and unique. Get 50% off with payment by AMEX Car
5
Amazing breakfast with girlfriends! Exquisite and delicious must-do. Enjoyed every bit of it. Ambiance and service are classy. The simplest breakfast food, eggs Singapore style with TWG twist was a symphony of taste (or maybe I was really hungry by the time, lol). Apparently, great tea service as the name suggests and we were unstoppable when I came down to polishing the lovely morning with pastry. Would go again, absolutely
5
TWG is a bit of an Asian institution and I just wish they had more of them in Europe. They serve an enormous selection of teas, so much so that they provide you with a book in which to read all about them before you choose. Therefore decisions can take sometime! If you like your final choice you can pop into their shop nearby (or at the airport) and buy some to take home.They also serve delicious scones with tea jelly and cream and other pastries and cakes, along with savoury appetisers.The staff are kind if a little slow, but tea is supposed to be an unhurried meal - isn't it?We take all our European visitors to TWG at least once during their stay as it provides a chance to sit down mid afternoon after a bout of sightseeing in the Marina Bay Area. Do note there are 2 TWG branches in the Shoppes so if this one is full try the other one which is smaller and tends to be quieter

Came by with my wife for some tea and light fare. The supervisor/manager recognized my wife from takashimaya twg and greeted us warmly. Being not much of a tea drinker myself, he recommended a great tea with nice floral scents and not too strong. The lobster salad and the oriental chicken salads were great too although it did take quite done time to come out from the kitchen. Ended up buying some macaroons for our daughter. Great people here and food was above expectations. Will be back.

I disagree with some of the comments here. We went for lovely dinner at one of the celebrity restaurants at the Shoppes. Afterwards, we decided to go for tea and dessert at TWG together with our Singaporean friends and we were looking forward to it. We walked up the bridge to enter the Tea Garden and there was no one in line. However, the waiter approached us and rudely pointed us to wait behind a line. We were stunned because no one was there we thought the waiter's manners were inappropriate for a place such as this. Anyway we just walked away and went elsewhere

not to be missed during your visit to MBS.. chill and relax during your tea time here.. as the ambience is good.. blends of nature and indoor with air conditioning . feels good to spend time with your family or friends. the patisserie and dessert is good as well.. love it..

I was here with some friends from overseas recently. My friends really enjoyed themselves with the various types of tea we ordered (Immortal, Snow of Fuji etc) but that was nothing surprising, TWG prides itself for having an extensive tea selection of exceptional quality after all and I'm no tea expert to provide a detailed critique.Food wise, aside from the High Tea Set which I've had before, the braised Beef Short Ribs (though slightly overcooked for my own preference) were really rich in flavor and my friends really enjoyed the dish. The other items were all pretty okay, I'm not that particular about food and the quality here more than sufficed my easily pleased appetite. I am usually too lazy to write a review but I do feel the need give a particular staff at the MBS TWG Tea Salon some recognition for his kind gesture and going out of his way to help a customer. A Caucasian staff by the name of Bucy (hope I got that right) received a request from me to get some iced water for a friend who was taking some medications and she only wanted iced water(and only iced water) to go with them. While he did mention that TWG does not serve iced water, he brought us a chilled bottle of Acqua Panna after some time. I had thought he might have forgotten about the request when he left where he was previously positioned at for a short while, but I figured he might have taken some time to chill the bottle or something. Really appreciate the effort and help. Thanks Bucy!

I did not go into the Tea Garden this time. Have had tea with TWG many times before and love it. This time I bought supplies to take home with me. Amin stayed with us suggesting teas and helping us with our choices. We really enjoyed our time at TWG and with Amin. I hope I have enough to last till our next trip. Just can't get enough of TWG teas.

Great place for weekend brunch. Had the brunch set that came with juice, pot of tea, scones/muffins, a main and cake. We tried the egg benedict, smoked salmon and tiger prawn salad. The cakes are to die for - sweet and savory.
4
Very fancy relaxed spot to have tea it is expensive though but the crepes where amazing and the tea was great it was nice to have afternoon tea
5
....like we meantime did a couple of times in different locations (Hongkong, Dubai). Their choices of different teas is unbelievable and they always met our expectations. Try the afternoon menue with different snacks, we liked it.
5
We were looking for a place near the hotel to grab a quick bite and ended up having breakfast at TWG twice.They have a set menu for breakfast which includes Tea , Fresh Juice, 2 croissants .The cost is around 24$ SGD but it is definitely worth every single penny. We initially thought that tea would be an odd combination with Juice but we had it towards the end and they have ~50 odd varieties . .from first flush darjeeling to . . africa . . . . .to brazil . . tea from everywhere :)Would recommend highly
4
I always loved eating at TWG.I loved the set lunch which I recently had at TWG Marina Bay Sands . We tried the Salmon and the chicken set lunch menus. Set menu was good , portion was ok only thing food was served rather slow. Was hoping they can improve on this Will come back again

If you don't want to stuff yourself with one of the huge weekend brunch offerings from the numerous hotels in Singapore then TWG is a good alternative. For pretty cheap you can get a set brunch meal of starter, main, pot of tea and then select a cake. Sometimes it can be a bit noisy since its inside a shopping mall however depending on who you are with you can usually block out the noise pretty quickly. Reliable quality food each time i go and it doesn't break the bank
5
3 of us went here not knowing what to expect as all meals are cooked in tea. My goodness am I glad we found this place. The salmon was absolutely delicious, cooked perfectly. Huge tea menu also. Service was super fast and friendly. Would highly recommend coming here for a lovely relaxing meal or snack. Will be back again when visiting Singapore

I am a die hard TWG tea fan and I was very excited to come to Singapore and have the tea experience in one of their many tea rooms. We chose Marina Sands for its really nice location and layout to treat our business partners to the pleasures of TWG tea,. It was, simply stated, AWFUL. The wait staff is so terrified of using too much tea that our tea arrived barely colored (we ordered things like French Early Grey which are dark teas). When we complained, the staff said they were operating under new orders on how to make the tea (ie with very minimal tea leaves). I will not be going back, nor will I recommend them to anyone. When you try to increase profits by cutting the product to the point that it is no longer desirable, you lose it all. At least I can still make good tea at home. TWG needs to fire the manager who came up with the brilliant idea to make tea taste like warm water
5
One of a chain of excellent locations in Singapore, this TWG is centrally located in the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Arcades and is adjacent to one of TWG's shops with hundreds of different teas.The food here is excellent as is the service and the comfort of the seating. It is quiet and a nice spot to sit, rest, visit with friends and share a meal from something simple to a full dinner.Highly recommended

This is a good place to have a snake an a cup of tea , of clues a wide selection of tea , the food and drink is good , but to be honest the service is not good at all , you have to wait for ages for any thing , even when you want to go to get the bill it takes so long Hope that they correct this as place is a good one
4
Good Food and Services, hubby loves it, some fancy lunch for holidays always good, food selection is decent and high tea always nice
5
Sophisticated olde English chic with modern overlay. Tea selection world class. I prefer it to Mariage Freres. Macaroons to die for, cakes sublime. All with fine porcelain china teacups, funky teapots, great service. Not cheap, but no quibble. Just tops
5
Having been underwhelmed by DB a few meters over earlier we chose TWG as it was empty and had a cheerful ambiance about it. We were thrilled and couldn't be happier with our choice. It was a third of the cost and the food was infinitely superior. We will come back again. The salad with our steaks were also particularly tasty
4
Lovely environment with extensive range of tea. Highly recommend the Singapore Signature Cake to go along with any tea of your selection. Last experience with this branch in Marina Bay Sands, they provided less than half a pot of the tea instead of a full pot such as in Orchard Ion TWG (which I usually visit). We are happy to pay SGD12 - 28 per pot for the premium tea but at least with decent amount of tea.Take note that there isn't any tea leave inside the pot so no refillable
4
Delight yourself while strolling along Marina Bay Sands. Off course the tea here never goes wrong. They have a huge selection of teas to choose from and the high tea snacks were pretty decent. The tea is great! The ice cream and sorbets were amazing. Their ice cream is really delicious with its fine and smooth texture. Not too sweet and the tea flavor really stands out Pssst! All dishes and desserts are infused with tea!
4
Stopped at TWG to have a quick lunch with my family. The menu wasn't extensive from a food point of view but the quality was very good. The tea selection was as expected exquisite. Very friendly service with a smile even though there were queues waiting for a seat. Would go back
5
Had a dinner with my family and a family friend a few hours before the calendar changed to 2016. Despite the long queue, we finally got our table for 5. Had good dinner, tea and some dessert.Service attendance was attentive and pro

The food is ok but not remarkably good. The tea is also good but not excellent. The staffs are also efficient but not top nortch. Then , I have to judge it as good or fair. 3 stars is ok. May be a bit more than 3 stars

it was here that i discovered that there is such a vast variety of tea available. one of the more expensive but worth trying is the white te

I love TWG and always take friends there when they visit from the UK - or anywhere else for that matter.The choice of tea is huge and caters for all tastes - I always take some back to the UK as presents from their shop at Changi airport.This particular outlet is in the Marina Bay Shoppes and is a lovely quiet oasis to stop for a break when sight seeing in the area. You are served by knowledgeable if slightly unsmiling waiters on crisp white table clothes in a leisurely fashion.We often combine the tea with some of their scones which are served with whipped cream and a tea jelly (one of four which are rotated). There are two small scones to a serving so depending on who you are with either split one portion between two or be greedy and have a portion each. The rest of their cake selection is too sweet for me, but I'm told delicious if you are after a sugar hit
4
This place is beautiful and good to hang out with friends, enjoying the afternoon tea, eat some cookies. But do consider the price, TWG Tea is famous and well known expensive. The atmosphere is very nice, and the service is good. I will definitely recommend this place
4
I had a business lunch at this restaurant, and I was impressed. The service is very attentive, the waiters are immaculate and he food is very good. We both opted for the business lunch menu, and it did not disappoint. The location is also very unique and offer a great opportunity for people watching
5
I must say that this was the first time ever that I had difficulty to choose my tea - as the selection was extensive! There's more than just the standard English Breakfast and Earl Grey here. Fortunately the courteous waiter helped me select one he thought I'd like - and true enough I really enjoyed every sip of my Eternal Summer tea. I found its beautiful red colour and rich scent simply invigorating and relaxing at the same time. Our guest loved his chicken salad, calling it "spectacular". We felt very indulged and special being served by their most attentive and ever smiling staff. I could have sat there for hours.

It would've been a nice lasagna (shame about the mint tea flavouring) great tea and scones, not very nice cakes - strange flavours. I know it's a tea company but why do they put tea in EVERYTHING - even the cakes and meat dishes. Some things aren't meant to be infused. It's certainly not cheap so I expect slightly better service - they were pretentious and rather sloppy. It's a lovely setting but that's all you pay for. They could improve and make it an excellent must-visit location in Marin Bay Sand
4
Unfairly I assumed TWG was going to be a gimicky range of teas and ordinary food.I am so glad I tried it for myself. The smoked duck salad (with foie gras and pine nuts) was lovely. Elegant. Light. Perfectly balanced and well seasoned. Nicely accompanied by a soft jasmine tea.A relaxing spot for lunch

This review is for the TWG restaurant situated by the canal.After receiving the menu, we waited a little over 5 minutes before we decided to signal a waiter to take our order. None of the waiters were attentive as the ones walking around the restaurant somehow missed my raised hand on multiple occasions.When I finally got the attention of one of the waiters, he rudely raised his hand at me which was akin to telling someone to "talk to the hand" and proceeded to clear the table behind us - something a reasonable person would assume was LESS important than taking the order of an existing and present customer.At that point I patiently assumed his plan was to finish off what he was doing before taking our order, however, several more minutes had passed after he had finished clearing the table and rather than come back to take our order or signal one of his colleagues, he proceeded to walk around the restaurant and attended to other customers as though I had not just asked him for assistance!What a disgusting level of customer service and it's a shame I didn't get his name as we stormed out of the restaurant soon after.Where is this over-pretentious attitude coming from

I ate here and ordered a glass of wine, some water and a lasagne. My wine and water came quickly but I was waiting for over 40mins for my dinner. They didn't seem that busy so asked when it would be coming only to be told the order was not in the system and that I didn't order any food.Very disappointed there was no apology, and that I was blamed for the waiters error. They rushed the order and the food was delicious. A shame the service let them down.

800 luxury teas from 36 different countries…we know what we wanted and ordered two mint teas, creme brulee and a green tea chocolate pastry/torte sprinkled with pistachio that we planned to share. The creme brulee was good, but the torte was average (I would say it was seating for a couple of days). I wish I would select a different dessert. The tea came just warm, and as other reviewers mentioned, we were disappointed when the tea cannot be refilled with the hot water. It was nice to have a cup of the afternoon tea at TWG surrounded by orchids. Service was good, can’t complain
4
Service, brilliant. Choice, amazing. It is always a pleasure to take time out at this lovely oasis in a busy schedule.
4
You come here for the incredible range of teas but they deliver some lovely food both sweet and savoury to go with the tea as well. not cheap but then this is fine dining tea ad is always a treat! i could spend all day trying different teas here.has to be tried
5
We really enjoyed the ambience in TWG tea shop and the 5* feel. We had -of course- some tea and also a breakfast - which was excellent. So I highly recommend it as a sophisticated visit with a great service and satisfying experience.
1
spotty linen, spotty service, dirty floors. not crowded. so it must be a really off-day for the outlet.
4
Nice to visit, enjoy some good tea and sweets, nice environment at marina bay sand, love the tea pots and the set up
4
Very good but some how pricy
Nice centered location
For a famous tea brand
Great service and friendly staff
Waiting for me the tea was Tasty
Along with Singapore surprise pie
3
Only like their tea and cakes. Above average. As for the rest of the menu.... Hmmm.Service fluctuates between good and average
4
We visited here as a stop off on the Singapore Tour bus. Just hopped off, visited the roof garden, had some tea and then joined the bus again.The tea choice is amazing, over 140 varieties. Really nicely presented and tasted great. We went for the scone deal which was good value. Overall, very British and great fun! Recommended
4
Food was great! Awesome place in a wide bridge above a contemporary canal where sampans glide.Excellent place for a romantic dates. You should try there tea set;) I love the scones.
4
Famed for its very wide range of teas, TWG tea garden is a nice stopover during shopping. There's am adequate array of cakes, petite fours and scones. I particularly enjoyed the ice teas and green tea sorbet.
4
If you are a fan of tea and like to drink pretty rare teas, that is the right place. Did not seen often a restaurant what serves teas where the cup costs hundreds of Dollars. But you have also cheaper options here - a went for a kind of ice tea which was excellent and 12 SD only. Also the breakfast and lunch served here are tasty, but pricy too
1
Service is pretentious and unhelpful. First time and surely the last time here. My baby fell sick and threw up at the restaurant. The service staff did not offer napkins for me to clean up. Even after I cleaned up the mess, they were reluctant to come over to my table to clear up the soiled napkins with my unfinished food. Totally unacceptable. No sympathy or what so ever. No high chair and doesn't feel at all apologetic about the lack of service. Afternoon tea set was extremely small. Service staff were snobs and unfriendly. A totally kid unfriendly environment. I'd rather go to other big hotels serving afternoon tea for the price I paid here.Such a disappointment
4
The collection of teas here is amazing, especially if you are looking for loose leaf. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and patient. The tea is a little expensive but has amazing taste.
5
Tea is amazing! Great atmosphere that make you enjoy the tea and food. Best selection of tea. I also tried their creme brulle which were delicious. Recommend for all who enjoy tasty tea.
5
How can one choose from about 400 different tea varieties? The staff are extremely helpful and are able to suggest appropriate teas to suit a person's taste. The cakes are truely mouth watering.
A great way to relax and enjoy a cuppa.
4
This place has the best selection of tea's ever! To go along with this you can try a selection of mouth watering macaroons. I also tried some of their ice creams, which were delicious too. Sadly, was too full after this to try the food!
3
The food was delicious but it was expensive.
It could be better only having a tea in here. It was also expensive but their tea selections are various.
5
Today I had the best service ever.. Would like to thank the service team there... Excellent service. And I would like to thank the manager as they needed to used the table were on for a bigger group they transfer us to another table but also top it up with a plate of 4 macaroons!! Thank you so much... It really went beyond my expectation... Excellent ... This is my second time coming here and will keep coming back for their teas and macaroons.. Not forgetting the service too... I know how it feels as am in the service industry too!! Thank you again and kudos!!! My favorite is the grand wedding passion fruit macaroon
5
My favourite go-to brunch/lunch/tea dates with my girlfriend! With over 400 selection of teas, we were spoilt for choices. We would order a different tea each time we went there. I have tried their floral tea selection and I love it! The soft and light floral frangrance of the tea are definitely aromatic. The service provided was excellent too! They will bring samples of the tea leaves if you would like to know what kind of tea that's on the menu and allow you to smell the fragrance of the tea leaves too.The macaroons are to die for! It's a must have after every meal. And the sweetness of the macaroons compliments the tea (as I do not add sugar to my tea)! My personal favourite would be the Bain de Roses Tea, Moroccan Mint Tea, Earl Grey Fortune & Chocolate, 1837 Black Tea & Blackcurrant and Matcha. Each macaroon costs $2. The high tea set was delish! For $30+ a set, you get a teapot of your own choice of tea, a selection of starters, mains and dessert too!The ice cream was great too! Though selection of flavours are limited, The Earl Grey Fortune ice cream was delish. The flavour was light and not too sweet. Definitely a must try! The ambience was definitely cosy and a great place to unwind while enjoying a good conversation over a cup of tea
5
Very cozy restaurant with delicious and beautifully designed dishes and... Tea!!!! Tea is amazing! Atmosphere is reach and cozy. Makes you relax and enjoy the tea. But staff shall be a bit more friendly and smily. Recommend for all who enjoy tasty tea and searching for impressive place

A bunch of headed to mbs for some retail therapy. Took a tea break and headed to twg. Amazing menu, very very vast and a huge collection of teas. We ordered some first flush tea and pastries and put our feet up for a while. Loved it
5
It is a small cafe in the middle of the shopping mall. You will feel like have tea in the middle of a garden. The tea set is food. If you are not hungry. You can try SGD32 tea set and order another drink for your couple.
