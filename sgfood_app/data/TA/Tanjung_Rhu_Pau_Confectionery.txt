A friend sugested me of this place, and I really like their Char Siew Pau very much. The big pork pau was ok, but I’ve had better elsewhere. The Char Siew Pau was one of the best I’ve tasted though

The size is smaller than I expected but the taste was delicious! One of the best pai i've ever tasted. We ordered the big pork pau n also the lotus, n both very very yummy!

Run by very rude people. Their food is expensive and not even excellent. I wouldn't recommend people to Come here to buy their food and still need to see their sour face.

Like their mini pau... small, bite sizes and tasty. Highly recommended if you happens to be around here.

Other than the Cha Siew Pau, the fan Choi here is nice too. Especially love how the Chilli goes with it. They have quite a variety of pastries too though these are not as good.

The tua pau (big pau) is delicious!! But you should be warned that the size of the tua pau is actually quite small. Taste-wise though they are excellent. The pau itself has a thin skin and inside the pau, it's packed with lots of meat and hard boiled egg. So so yummy!
