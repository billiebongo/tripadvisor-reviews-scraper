Quiet spot on a Sunday morning if you take my noisy lot out of the equation. All day brekky options. Freshly baked bread.
5
Ordered dishes of beef ribeye and aglio olio spaghetti. Taste not bad! Best recommended to have friends to dine with you.
5
Love the food and ambience. It's casual but not shabby. Highly recommend the mushroom spaghetti, spinach omelette, sandwiches, breads and cheese melt. The produce used is of very high quality and the food is excellent. Lovely for brunch. Highly recommend it!

i had the nassim double decker burger with fries, my friend had the steak with sunny side up eggs and we shared a portion of truffle fries. food was decent, however can be slightly noisy during peak hours.
1
The restaurant was closed! No notification on their website and CHOPE accepted the reservation without question. I don't know who to be angry with. Extremely disappointing since we went all the way to the restaurant for a nice CNY eve lunch. We went away with a really bad taste in our mouths.

I've been in Singapore a week and after a local ( SG resident) friend's recommendation have had brunch here 4 times. It's one of the best I have had anywhere, let alone Singapore. An extensive brunch and lunch menu is offered from morning to late afternoon. Ingredients are fresh, bread is freshly baked with a really good choice of different types, all interchangeable according to your preference e.g. Sourdough ( which is some of the best I've had) or wholemeal etc. Waffles ,pancakes and omelettes are excellent. Portions are massive and the coffee is sublime. Customer choice seems to be really important here , as you can choose sizes and swap options all across the menu. Service is friendly and really efficient. The place is immaculately clean too. Highly recommended

Enjoyed a marvelous few hours with great friends at Nassim Hill. We took advantage of the Wed Ladies special - spend at least $35 each on food and enjoy unlimited prosecco for two hours. The food was delicious - be sure and the cheese board and try some desserts - and service was prompt and friendly...we appreciated them "informing" us exactly how much more we needed to spend! We will be back
5
As someone who is always on the hunt for good brunch places, I have to say this tops my list so far. They have a good variety and their food selection is unique. You have many different types of brunches to choose from unlike many other cafes with the same usual offerings.
5
Took my family for dinner at Nassim Hill. Cosy ambience. Menu is western but the chilli crab pasta caught my eye. Ordered and tried it and loved it! The chilli crab pasta is worth trying. Yummy. Nelson from the restaurant made sure everyone was well taken care off. Lovely place to take the family for a weekend meal

I decided to have brunch with my family after hearing raving recommendations from friends. Firstly, the interior design took me by surprise. It had a vintage yet classic design. It was a sight for sore eyes.The manager of the outlet, Brennan Tan, personally ushered us to our seats and kindly acceded to our recommendation request. He was genuine in the way he spoke and made us feel very welcomed. We ordered 3 servings of ‘Steak with Eggs’. The steak was well marinated and grilled, with the side of nice runny yolks. We also ordered a Greek Goddess and a Ham and Cheese sandwich to be shared among the four of us. Their dessert, ‘Banana and Chocolate Waffles’, baked with French flour and topped with New Zealander ice cream according to Brennan, is a MUST try!Overall, we had a very pleasant experience and will definitely come back again!
5
A cosy environment with amazing food. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. . The waffles is a must try no matter how full you are!! Can't wait to go back again and try the other food...
5
Great food hence the very crowded place. Definitely must reserve if you are party of 4 or bigger. Will come back.
5
A nice and cosy place. Food is nice, love their scrambled eggs and service is excellent too! Good place to hangout.
4
Creative yummy dish- cheddar waffles left an impression on us. Pity that they are a bit short-handed on a busy Saturday!
3
I've always liked Nassim Hill Bakery for its service and food - their Bakery and Dessert items are an added bonus. The Sunday Brunch food experience still held up. However the noise level and the jam packed dining area left much to be desired - it was hard to ignore the couple next to us - they were only half an arms length away and if we wanted to, we could easily participated in their conversation ;)
3
A bunch of youngsters with no hospitality experiences. Did not even serve water when we requested it. For the price we paid, bad food quality.
2
Place was very crowded which is understandable, but tables were placed too close to each other. No privacy and was quite uncomfortable as it felt as though we were evesdropping on the conversations of neighbouring tables! Service staff seemed to be lacking and slow to respond, had to try a few minutes before managed to flag down someone (possibly due to lunch hour). For the pricing, I found it lacking. Food was average and can find better quality for cheaper price elsewhere, especially truffle fries which was not mixed evenly and some portion did not get any truffle oil on it at all
4
It was hard to find the bistro, perhaps more signs at main entrance of Post Office. We had the Salmon Omelette and Steak&Eggs. The cream cheese of the Salmon Omelette was nested in a ball in one corner could be better spread out. Drinks are expensiv
5
The sweet potato fries came with the most amazing viniagrette-ish dip ever, so delicious! I recommend the chilli crab pasta for sure (small size is just fine, itâ€™s a regular bowl; the larger one is HUGE). We got 4 mains and all of them were very flavorful
3
Food's pretty good if you order the right dishes (po boy, Reuben). Manager (I think, as he was the only one in regular clothes) who stood at door only said thanks, come again and goodbye to the one who paid the bill even though we all walked past him. I felt that was quite rude to be honest. It's also quite loud inside and the spaces between tables very tight.
4
Food is nice and value for money. Pet friendly cafe. Waffle ice cream is also nice. Service is prompt and polite.
3
Portions were a bit on the small side. Ordered sea bass and chilli crab pasta. Both were not too bad but I've had better. Service was good though. Wouldn't visit again if no 1 for 1.
4
The chili crab pasta is a must try. Generous amount of crab meat though the dish could be a tad spicy.
4
Cosy place for gatherings. Can get crowded even on weekdays for lunch. Service staff are very attentive and prompt.
5
Really enjoy the food at this casual bakery cafe - highly recommend the cheese bacon waffles! Good for kids too. Reservations are recommended.
5
Pizza was good. Nice and comfortable place. We had a great time here with 1 for 1 beer promotion. This is good place for gathering.
4
It’s my first Time there and I find that the food was great and service was awesome too. It’s just that the place is a little cramp with all the tables quite close to each other and can be quite crowded when there’s a lot of customers
4
I have been Nassim hill bakery since 2015. Main reason of my family’s regular visit was that my wife loves chili crab pasta and I love T bone strake with 1 for 1 draft beer. Now I can add one more reason thanks to new manager, Brennan. As a neighborhood bistro, I would love to have casual conversation with Nassim hill team about food and drink. Finally Brennan starts to provide it with friendly and natural manner with his good wine collection. Thank you Brennan to recommend nice Pinot Noir. I would also love to try red from côtes du Rhône next time. Merry Christmas Brennan and team. Cheers.
4
The food at Nassim Hill Bakery is always delicious, but the service can be a little hit or miss. We asked for water that never arrived. My husband's cocktail was substituted for a different one without explanation because they were out of Manhattans? One of our friend's requested an additional side order portion (willing to pay extra) that was then removed from his plate and arrived separately but with no additional amount. The staff did their best to make things right, but service was a little off that night
3
Whilst the food is decent, the restaurant is very popular with the younger crowd, and is extremely noisy. The restaurant is understaffed and it's frustrating to try to get their attention to make an extra order, get them to serve the next course or get the bill. Won't be returning any time soon
4
Food is nice. There is an on-going Nov promotion for entrees - Buy 3 and Get 1 Free. Good deal and the service is prompt.
4
We loved the food served there! Affordable as well. The only downside is the location might not be too near the MRT
4
Great service with the manager coming over to chat and ask how things are. Liked the Dbs promo offer buy 3 get 1 main free etc. Couple with happy hour...and the jazz music
5
Brunch gathering with friends, but unluckily the waffle is not available on that day.
Anyway, the place are nice, food are excellent. Coffee is delicious.
Recommend: waffles abd chilly crab pasta
5
Family gathering went really well, variety of food to fit all ages’ taste, spacious table, great drinks and portion
4
quiet at night, a great place to chill out with friends after a long day at work. awesome chili crab pasta and banana chocolate waffles!
5
Finally got a chance to have brunch here! Ordered Salmon Omelette and Steak and Eggs! It was so so yummy! The Pear Cheese Crumble is worth the try! It was great!
4
We visited for both breakfast and then evening drinks as there was a 2-for-1 special between certain hours. Breakfast was really nice but on the expensive side. Swapping out whipped cream on the french toast for a single scoop of ice cream cost S$5. Other than that we were really happy with the meals and would recommend it to anyone staying nearby
4
Ordered the country scrambled eggs and nutty bird. Food is good however the service needs to be improved. Water was only given to us after we remind the waitress and waiters 4 times. Make my reservation through chop and when my friend arrived, they serve the "ang moh" customer first.
4
Food is not bad. However my friend ordered the aglio olio the prawn is under cooked hopefully restaurant can improve on this understand the cafe is pretty busy at the brunch hour. The indoor seating is a bit too noisy if you wish to have a good chat.
4
Love the setup. Service staff are cheerful and pleasant. Food is yummilcious! Will be back for more and more!
4
Food quality is good and portion is relatively big. Value for money. Love the half-portion pasta. Beer prices are relatively cheap. Good place to hang out with friends. Tend to get a little noisy though when it's crowded. Acoustics of the place is not conducive for private chats
4
i ordered one set. they served me a basket of complementary bread. the bread baked very crispy. liked so much made me cannot finish my main course...
3
It was fairly noisy - like a kopitiam. We were lucky that we were given a corner which was good. The carbonara was so-so, did not finished it. The Caesar salad was ordinary. Wanted the waffles but were sold out by the time we were there which was 1pm. The buttermilk pancake was good. The homemade ice-lemon tea was merely tea with syrup sugar and no lemon, absolutely nothing special.
2
I'm only back here because I have a voucher to spend. Didn't enjoy my previous experience here because the brunch food was so filled with MSG & the service was bad. It's not that the waitstaff aren't friendly - they are. But they were just so disorganised & it was difficult to get their attention.This time, same level of slightly absent-minded service (asked if I had anything outstanding on the bill to settle, waitress said she'd get back to me.... 10 mins later I had to ask another waitress to check for me once more. Geez.), so it was great that my food fared better than the last time.Frightened by the previous MSG-laden experience, I opted for the lighter Spinach Egg White Omelette ($17++) which did not disappoint me. The Omelette was fluffy & the spinach tasted great & not overly seasoned. Would order this again, but I'll be honest- I loved this only because I had the voucher to spend. My general feel about the food here is that it is on the pricey side.. & it's always so noisy (crowded & not the best acoustics?) that I don't feel very relaxed when I dine here. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats available☀️ Al fresco seats available Accepts reservations - Chope or Quandoo Free water served Good luck getting good servic
5
It’s always a pleasure to stop by Nassim Hill bistro. New manager Brennan and all staff are very kind and so attentive to provide the most caring service in a friendly but professional way. I enjoy very much the cozy atmosphere with their jazz music background. Wednesday and Thursday they offer free flow Prosecco for 2 consecutive ladies nights! It’s definitely the place you need to visit in this neighbourhood!
4
Having very little time to head to lunch, we decided to find a reasonably priced lunch menu near our hotel. This location was suggested by a person who lives and works in Singapore. I opted for the shrimp po boy on sourdough bread which was a large portion and was very well done. You could tell the shrimp were fresh as they were not chewy. The sandwich was so large I had to take half home. When I say reasonably priced at $13 USD, I can live with that for Singapore. Stop in and try their menu ...it was worth our time
5
I come to Singapore often and go out of my way to visit this wee gem.I'm confused as to some of the reviews here. Who waits 40 minutes before grabbing the attention of the Supervisor?And some of the pictures? Do you people disassemble the meal, eat half of it and then 'mock up' a lousy picture? I have never seen a meal come out of the Nassim kitchen looking anything like these photos.There are always "new staff". Give them a chance to fix their mistakes.Brennan (spelling - hope I got your name right mate!) Is 'on the ball'.My partner and I have had 2 brilliant meals there last two days. Great service, excellent presentation. Portion sizes spot on. And...do yourselves a favour and take home any of their in home breads... to die for.And NO... I'm not a partner in nor am I affiliated with this restaurant.Read my other Reviews...if its no good, they are "target practice".See you again soon guys
5
We often go to this cheerful bakery-restaurant.The baguette is voted one of the best in singapore by the French community.I personally love their sandwiches and waffles. The waffles Are crispy and not too sweet. The baker was trainer in France and is always there baking his delicious creations
3
dine with the 1 for 1 deal for sept 2017 with chope promo. the first waitress told us that the 1 for 1 has to be the same item. however, when we ordered under a second waitress, we were informed that it can be different items. it would be good if the staff can be aligned in their messaging. had the chilli crab spaghetti and mushroom risotto. portion for risotto was super small! chilli crab spaghetti could do with more crab chunks as well. i wouldnt pay the full price to dine here agian.
5
Cosy place. The food is great. Excellent price with the entertainer app. (It's a one for one offer) they serve a free basket of bread. I love the steak.
5
The entertainer app makes the food here so affordable. I love the cheddar waffle, amongst other mains. Been here quite a number of times and the standard has stayed the same.
5
Ordered a prawn aglio olio and waffles with sausage. One of the best waffles I've had at a cafe so far. Will be coming back again
4
It was good place to have brunch with fresh baked bread. It’s a bit noisy but only people are crowded.
4
I went there for a brunch with my hubby and it felt overall very cosy. Both of us loved the food & the service. I will definitely go there for a 2nd tine.
1
I live nearby to this place, and I stopped going for a while due to multiple issues. I decided to give it another try and regrettably I was served rotten food.....
3
Read many good reviews about the waffles but disappointed that all waffles and pancakes are not available! Had the crab pasta, Po Boy Sandwich and French Toast. Not impressed
2
Went for breakfast with a group of kids. No waffles available on Saturday morning , kids hugely disappointed. On the phone they had confirmed they could do eggless pancakes and waffles but couldn't do it the day we went . Pancakes were burnt! Service wasn't great and staff not very friendly . Fix it or perish !
3
Menu was misleading, service staffs were not attentive. We had to keep asking them to refill our cups though there werent many people in the restaurant. mushroom risotto has beef slices in it but was not stated in the menu. Only after ordering, it came with beef in it. When we mentioned that we do not take beef, staff just mentioned okay. didnt offer to prepare another set nor offer to remove the beef.
4
Third time here, as usual ordered their artisan bread basket. Disappointed that they started to charge for parking (even for guests dining in)
4
Chili crab pasta was the bomb!! Super nice and generous with the sauce. However, wagyu beef pasta was mediocre, and pasta was too dry.
5
Great food! Great ambience! Parking is limited and very expensive though. Had the one for one pasta with chope. Nice pasta!
4
The ambience was good. Cosy and comfortable. Good for gatherings as well as couple dating. Waiting time of the food is average.
5
This place has gorgeous food. I love the freshly baked bread. I visit here daily when on holiday as it's close to where I stay.
4
Overall, the food was pretty good. We ordered bone marrow to start, chili crab pasta and meat ragú pasta for mains and a stout cake to finish. The chili crab sauce was quite heavy handed with chili and garlic, while the meat ragú could have done with a tad more fresh parsley. Other than that, the food was good.On the service end, there were a few hiccups that impacted our overall impression. I'd made a reservation via chope for 2, with a note to serve the dessert we eventually ordered with a lit candle. When we arrived, the FOH initially couldn't find our name as it had already been ticked off. We also found it strange that, when asked about what starters to recommend, the suggestions from the waitstaff were all fries-related, especially as we had read that this place bakes its own bread fresh every day. Finally, when the stout cake arrived, there was no candle on it.
4
After an absence of four years, we returned to Nassim Hill Bakery during what probably is their busiest hour: 11 am on a Sunday morning. We didn't have reservations, but they seated us at a large communal table. The young wait staff try hard, and they move fast. You have to enter your name and phone number to use the free wi-fi. I had eggs Benedict which was delicious. My wife had cheese waffles with bacon which were hard because of the cheese. I had two glasses of Diet Coke which brought the bill for two people to SGD 60, about the same as what most hotels charge above the room cost for buffet breakfast. But it was a nice break from the hotel even though it was very very popular with the locals
5
We wanted an American Breakfast and this delivered. Creative and delicious eggs, guacamole, bacon and side salad for me and skillet eggs for the Mrs (almost Mexican style). Food was great, but coffee was simply Nespresso. Paid $6 for a Nespresso pod!? Oh well, the food was grea
4
Simple wooden tables with no tablecloth, indoor or outdoor seating, good service and just enough choices for an excellent lunch.The bloody Mary is good with a garnish of the usual celery but also three cherry tomatoes.Do not miss the truffle fries. The caesar salad is very nice and nearly a meal on its own. We took pasta as main and both the spaghetti were good (olio and carbonara).And if you are going home post lunch to buy a baguette or some cakes which are home made
4
This place gets crowded over brunch on weekends so make reservations ahead if you're a big group. We've been here multiple times and never fail to order the reuben sandwich and steak and eggs. The steak and eggs comes with a side of bread slices from their Bakery. Love it!!
5
For whatever reason it is hard to find a reasonably priced and satisfying Sunday brunch in Singapore. Multiple places try to be too Creative and end up with something that is to complicated to say never mind eat. Nassim hill has all the staples on the breakfast menu and they serve it till 4.00pm. I had the Skillet Eggs(Harisa, Spanish chirizo and 2 eggs cooked in the middle of it) and it was amazing. I will be going back next week to try something else :-). An added bonus is that it is Soh friendly and they even brought out a water bowl for our Airedale! Bill was not bad by singapore standards
4
One of the better brunch places, good food (try the steak), friendly staff, nice ambience, would come back again
5
Eggs , great breads, amazing salads, hamburgers , sweet potato fries AND the most wonderful waffles in spore( both sweet and savoury)
And oh let's not forget their delicious, sweet mussels.
And French roast!!
5
The best Granola, excellent Caesar Salads and many more enjoyable and healthy options in a pleasant setting with very good and swift service - to be recommended

Nassim Hill said that they are a Bakery, Bistro and Bar probably because they are a wonderful place to go for all day dining: they have menus for breakfast, lunch and dinner; with a 9am to 9pm one-for-one beer “happy hour” to boot.It is located at the back (Nassim Hill side) of Tanglin Post Office; away from the hustle and bustle of Tanglin /Napier Road junction. Their space is an open concept with a takeaway bakery bar and an interesting long table in the middle of the restaurant. There’s also outside seating - if its too crowded and noisy inside - where you can park your car and walk a few steps to your table!All the three menus are long. For breakfast, you are spoilt for choice with all manners of eggs including Shakshouka, waffles and pancakes. The breakfast spills over to lunch (till 4pm) with additional offerings of salads, sandwiches (signature Stout bread anyone?), pizzas and pastas. Dinner adds fish and meat options, and shared platesThe two of us decided to order two shared plates of Poutine and The Big Dipper. Poutine is the Canadian street food of fries glaced with their special dark gravy of minced beef with mozzarella. The Big Dipper is a casserole of crab, spinach and artichoke: great to dip with or spread over a toast. The Nassim Hill Caesar’s salad is one of the best I’ve had in Singapore. We reckon it is the dressing which has an optimal amount of anchovy.The wines are inexpensive at $10 per glass for the happy hour (more like happy day cos 9-to-9 remember?).Oh, I forgot to mention desserts … because we are usually too full despite their very tempting cakes including a Chocolate Stout Cake.So, next time if you are wondering where to go – for breakfast, lunch, tea, drinks, dinner or just to chill – you must try Nassim Hill BBB
3
The menu here is extensive! A huge variety of options to choose from, you might be at a loss (if you're like me). Nassim Hill was super crowded on a Sunday for lunch; the noise in an enclosed space made it a little difficult to talk if you're looking for a quiet place to catch up with a friend. We ordered the Skillet Eggs ($19++) & Spicy Huevos Benedict ($19++), with a Latte ($6++). Coffee was average, food was tasty & we were pleased as we ate. However, I was incredulously thirsty for the rest of the day so I think there is a lot of MSG in the food? That's a shame. Quite a turn-off & I feel like I might not be back anytime soon. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats available☀ Alfresco seats available Accepts reservations - I used Quandoo WiFi availabl
3
We started with bruschetta, followed with lamb chops, Chilean sea bass and aglio aglio pasta. The highlight must surely be the dessert- Parmesan pear crumble with ice cream was great. Overall, food is pretty good, but the service staff seemed not in the know on the food and wine available there, perhaps more training needed
4
Spent a good morning catching up with old friends and family. Food is so so (ice in the smoothies were a bit too chunky). Service started out decent but as it got crowded, it just dipped. Waitinf staff a little overwhelmed. If driving use the basement car park instead but be warned that parking is not cheap. Overall a nice place to chillaz.
4
Nice cafe with extensive menu. Came over for lunch with a friend. Was good to have choice between their lunch menu and all-day breakfast menu. Coffee was good but flat white was quite small portion. Gave four stars as my food came quickly but the salad which my friend ordered was not being served Ina timely manner and we had to keep asking for it to be delivered to the table could of times.
5
Nassim Hill Baerky is a bit hard to find as it is on the back side of the old Tanglin post office building. They have a good selection of fresh baked breads. I enjoyed my egg skillet. The coffee is good too. Definitely a place to go back again
4
Down with the flu during deepavali holiday.So, i just spent the whole.day inside my bedroom.The next day, a bit recover after the flu meds & etc.My friend just asked me to join him for dinner at Nassim Hill.I've been to Nassim Hill like a few years ago, but what impressed me.is only their bread.I agreed then went to NassimWe ordered the grilled chicken salad, which is surprisingly very huge. A bit like the yu sheng style (chinese new year salad).The chilli crab pasta is al dente and quite huge in portion. It is good with lots of crabmeats. I just felt that there is something lacking a bit about the sauce (since i just ate at No Signboard seafood the other week, and ordered the SG chilli crab). But of course each restaurant has their own recipe and can not compare.The quesadilla chicken is quite ok. Last but not least we ordered the ice cream with cheese crumble and pear.The combination between the cheese crumble and vanilla ice cream is quite yummy. When you mix with the pear, it is quite interesting. The dynamic of different flavour and textures compliment each other.The staffs quite attentive and the ambiance is also good
3
Food is good at this place. Breakfast is a good time to come. Eggs benedict is especially good. But it can get crowded and there's not much parking. The staff also seem to be a little clueless as to who to serve first.
3
Popped in here for a coffee earlier this week. It was served at the right temperature and was pretty strong. Efficient service.
3
Was hosted to a company event here. Drinks selection average with beers on tap but no house specialty beers. Food platter has pizza, soft shell crabs, fries.
3
My review will be similar to what other reviewers have said - the food here is OK, but the service is completely missing.Ordered the below items on a weekend:- Brioche French Toast ($17.00)- Hearty Scrambled Eggs (Choice of salami or prosciutto, $20.00)- Long Black ($5.00)- Tomato Juice ($6.00)French Toast was good; much better than other restaurants ranked highly for their french toast (*think some obscure restaurant at Chip Bee Gardens...*)The hearty scrambled eggs was not too bad as well, though the toasted bread came in a cardboard box while the rest of the eggs and prosciutto arrived on a porcelain plate, which was kinda weird.The Long Black was strong and aromatic, without much taste of sour-ness within.The tomato juice didn't seem to be freshly-squeezed, but was like those poured from a carton/can.Service was like everyone said, non-existent. Try calling for a server and you'd probably take more than 5 minutes to get the attention of one. If you ever did get the attention of any of them, you'd be shushed aside with a crude "wait".Then again, there's no service charge imposed at this eatery, so who am I to complain
4
Food is good and very filling - especially the Reuben and Po' boy sandwiches. Coffee not bad plus they have wine and beer as well, so great for a long lunch. The restaurant is large for a cafe and gets extremely crowded, so the staff are run off their feet and service suffers during peak periods, but if you're hungry you'll be more than satisfied by the food
2
We were seated one the long bar table - mind you, the seats and tables behind were squashed up so close to the bar table that people had to move for us to squish into the space. Coffee was ok but getting any kind of service proves to be quite a hard feat. When the food arrives, bar one person who waited for a sandwich, the quality is a bit disappointing - having looked forward to the laksa pasta, the sauce had more of a strong curry taste. Finally the sandwich arrives after we ask bout 5 staff and only one is bothered to find out for us. With scattered service and waitstaff that didn't appear to know what was going on, we won't be heading back in a hurry
5
Really enjoyed the ambience and the food here, as it was nice and relaxing even though there were quite a few people. Got the cheese bacon waffles and the chilli crab pasta, both tasted wonderful. Used the entertainer so it was very affordable. Will definitely return
5
I can never decide. I want to eat them all. They do all-day wonderful breakfasts. Scrambled eggs, brioche French toast , their waffles (best in spore) , my dad loves their burgers and fries. My de riguer hangout place for some comfort food and great company w friends.
3
This is probably my 3rd or 4th visit to Nassim Hill Bakery. I would say that the food is not that bad. I've tried their skillet eggs, eggs benedict, chilli crab pasta, which are all appealing and appetizing.Aside from the food and cosy setting, I feel that they have very bad crowd management. They have a healthy team of servers, definitely not short manpower, however simple drinks like organic green tea (which is just a bag in a tea pot) can take up to 30 mins to be served. My friends and I waited for a long time just for the drinks to be served, and even when served, they made a mistake for one of my friend's order. We let it pass because they really looked busy, or seemed like they cannot cope, also also partly because we do not want to wait for another half an hour to get the drink.I made a reservation for 4 on a weekend. However, another friend decided to join us and we needed an extra seat. This place does not allow you to grab another chair from another un-used table. We were ok to squeeze 5 pax to a 4 seater, but they "don't have enough chairs". So we couldn't grab another chair from another table. This caused us slight distress as our poor friend had to stand. I feel that they could have done a better job with their customers. At that point, servers looked stressed and unsure of what to do when they see one patron standing by a table, without a chair. They are quite stringent in releasing chairs from the empty "reserved" tables, and also empty chairs with patrons' bags and belongings. 1hr later, we managed to change to a bigger table, to accommodate 5 of us. (hallelujah)If you have alot of time to burn during weekends and do not mind the long wait (longer wait due to their poor crowd management), then you won't have any issues with this place. Otherwise, make a reservation early, and also make sure your headcount is final and confirmed

celebrated my wife's birthday with a late breakfast / brunch at 945am on 9 aug. She's a national day baby. first visit for us to nassim hill bistro. heard of this place from friends who had been there before and their feedback was ok.ordered country breakfast scrambled eggs and sausage x2. steak breakfast with 2 sunny side up. salmon omelette x2. artisans bread basket. tea and cappuccino. food tasted good and its a bit like cedele style breakfast sets. service was good and friendly. we chomped it down quickly as we usually eat breakfast much earlier at 7am. the lunch menu only starts at 11am and we will come again to try out the lunch item. there was a chilli crab pasta that caught our interest...the place is very crowded but its spacious enough to accommodate groups, families with kids and couples with ample in between spaces. a little girl around 5 yrs belted out "majullah singapura" our national anthem which ended with a round of applause from all of us in the cafe.:). credit to our government's national education efforts
5
Service. Food. Drinks. Atmosphere. Staff. Airconditioning! This place is hidden away and frequented by wealthy locals and expatriates alike. Reasonably priced, its always busy. I advise to always try and book.
3
Overhyped. Nothing fancy. Food is average. Service is average and not very attentive. Place is crowded and noisy. Not recommended. Will think twice about coming again.
3
For all the reviews I read, I think it's just average. Ordered 1 of their popular chili crab pasta and I thought it's lacking the punchDespite having chunky crab meat inside I thought the taste is too run-down. Nothing like the real chili crab. Could have been better if they could improve on the tasteThe place is so crowded. As it's also small, it gets really noisy an dizzying with noise and laughter a bouncing across the room
5
Have been visiting this place for 3 years... Very very good brunch cafe type food, much better than rivals around orchard. Have visited rivals before settling on this place. Particularly the salads (detox - avocado, berries), egg dishes (shakshuka - eggs in tomato gravy) are amazing. Eggs benedict is good, though it leaves you wanting more. Apparently the sandwiches are also good, but never have space left (in tummy). Also recommend the assorted bread basket (not the normal one) as the walnut bread is yum. Have tried the sweet & savoury waffles before which are also crunchy & decent. They have a Bakery attached to the restaurant.  Service is quick, located in a quiet end of orchard. Highly recommend.Disclaimer: love the food

We went for brunch on Sunday. The restaurant was quite busy but they found our reservation and seated us quickly. Ordered an eggs benedict, truffle fries and a ham sandwich. All the food was very well cooked. Service was also very efficient. Would have given this 5 stars - however it was quite noisy and tables were squashed together and hence only 4 stars.
2
While the bakery has a welcoming ambience and decor, the disappointments quickly set in once you sit down! Overpriced, poor service with food, despite the generous portions, that is unpredictable in quality. When we went (late breakfast on a Sunday), it was filled with expats - reflecting its great location and ambience
5
A wonderful place to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner - all is of highest quality and perfectly prepared! Manager Kenny is an outstanding host. I simply love this place and try to go there as often as I can
2
Majority of staff were not attentive at all, always talking amongst themselves and were totally inefficient. Messed up our orders and even made us wait 30 minutes for the ever so "famous" reuben sandwich and beer. The place wasn't even packed and our staff didn't even serve us the right orders. Not coming back here again!

Some restaurants are motivated by the experience they offer their customer which includes the food. Unfortunately, NHB is not such a place. The servers try hard but the overall structure is not focused on pleasing the customer rather it is more directed at forcing the customer to accept their structure. Many of the offerings come with eggs - if one orders something and asks to substitute the eggs - No options. I get that things have been priced out to include eggs but where is the management's creativity in being able to offer a suitable substitute? Another issue - Toast. I was lead to believe that toast is bread that is well, "toasted" that is to say "grilled" or exposed to radiant heat in such a way that it develops a little crustiness. At NHB, the concept is toast is to scare the bread with a little heat so that is just warmed. Presumably this is to save on the cost of purchasing a toaster. Cheese waffles are still a winner but that's about all
2
Came here for lunch with the family. Pasta was salty, and steak with eggs were not worth the price. Carrot soup and salad were average. The noise level was high as chatters were trapped in the restaurant with low ceilings and cement flooring, made worse by seats packed so close that the servers appeared to have difficulty manoeuvring themselves. The the aircon was down, dad was perspiring and could see other diners dapping drips of perspiration on their temples. The upside was friendly and helpful servers who were doing their best to bring about a good experience.
4
Food was not too bad. Although the poutine wasn't as authentic as the ones in Canada, the Rosemary Lamb chops we're great. Service staff we're friendly and attentive.
4
Wide choice of food and drinks. I really enjoyed my salad and the sweet potatoe fries. The bread was fresh. Taste the waffles, you'll love it!
4
Been here for both breakfast and dinner and the food served was equally as good.On both occasions the food was fresh and well executed.The one for one beer promotion was well appreciated on both visits !!Breakfast was especially busy which caused the service to suffer, some servers seemed totally overwhelmed whilst others drifted about aimlessly
3
Been coming here for years for breakfast. Chill atmosphere especially on weekdays. Opens early and food is good. Came for dinner recently - they had a lot of promotions going on so a lot of people. So noisy couldn't even hear the person next to me speak. Dinner menu food completely forgettable and really not that nice.
5
I love this place - the food is delicious - the coffee is delicious - the bread is baked fresh and is... Well delicious. Reasonably priced - great service - open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I love coming here. Weekend brunches are full so book online well in advance
1
We went on a Friday evening. Service was tardy, the staff would rather wash dishes than pass us our bill, the beer came AFTER we finished our dinner, aircon was off more than an hour before closing time. Burger, pastas were all terrible. Sweet potato fries were the only saving grace. Never returning again.
4
When my Friend of 30+ years called and said he is free for brunch before his flight back at 1.00pm I was scratching my head for a good place that serves great brunch and also a good environment to catch up.Thank God for Nassim Hill Bakery where we both enjoyed our time there. The Egg Benedict with sausage is just perfect as we both ate heartily and enjoyed our conversation.Will certainly visit more often and maybe I should spend some alone time there too to enjoy some reading or just go online
3
The food was pretty decent, with the Chilli Crab Pasta in particular a standout. The flat white that I had was rather 'flat', and totally uninspired with no latte art or even putting in the effort to use a coffee stencil. The cafe itself was very noisy as well, and definitely not a place to chill and relax at
1
Delicious steak and eggs, fish and chips, chili crab pasta. Beef Sandwich, scallop and salad also delicious but portions were too small. Family of 5 (3 teens, 2 adults). Dessert of brownie parfait was totally delicious, but sooooo small! Lady's night Prosecco on Wednesday andTuesday was a nice touch too:) Overall, family had a good time. Good service from young lady server
1
Bakery you said? Yeah right... Nice setting, terrible food, jsut wlak across the road to tanglin mall for more options
5
Dropped in for breakfast. Son had the steak & eggs and he absolutely loved it. Will need to come back for lunch or dinner since happy hour lasts till 9 pm :)
4
The restaurant was very busy at lunchtime and I would recommend booking a table. The staff were very pleasant, but could be a little more interactive. The manager is always very personable. I was very impressed with the Detox salad with its combination of ingredients and presentation of the salad dressing in a fun bottle. My lunch guests ordered the Asian chicken salad and enjoyed the lunch too. The coffee was also very good. I will return just to enjoy the salad
3
This is usually popular at brunch but dinner time was quite packed as well.We started with a Caesar salad, which was okay though not very exciting. I liked the addition of the chopped walnuts and beets, and the dressing was not overly oily or tart, which was nice.We also had the lamb chops and I throughly enjoyed the dish, especially the mash potato with spinach. Service was very good. When a server spilled a little of our drink, they immediately changed the glass. Also, when my wife brought to their attention that her two jumbo prawns were undercooked, they replaced the entire dish rather than just sear the prawns for a couple more minutes. The pasta was nicely al dente and the sauce was delicious and rather rich without being overpowering.The nutella filled madelines were rather dry, but we enjoyed the banana waffles with vanilla ice cream. We had a glass each of chardonnay and sauvignon, and both were nice though a little young.If you park in B1, the lift brings you to the back door where the beer kegs etc are stored. Just walk through and head to the front
3
We had lunch there with a friend and our 2 toddlers. As everywhere else in Singapore we expected it would be easy with the kids but except from the kids chair, nothing was there for them (no special menu, cutlery..). Our food was ok but nothing special, not worth another visit
4
Came for brunch in a Saturday - having booked (recommended) because the place was packed at noon.Enjoyed the Reuben sandwich on their signature Guinness bread and steak and eggs - both excellent.A jug of Sangria to wash it down and that went down extremely well, ready for a snooze afterwards :-)The flat white coffee though was not so good.So recommended for the food and the pitchers - not for the coffee
3
My friends and I all ordered the Spicy Huevos Benedict; spicy guacamole, poached eggs and chorizo sausage on white ciabatta, for a weekday lunch. I thought the food was quite ordinary, there wasn't anything spectacular about the dish. There wasn't anything wrong with the taste of the dish, as it was a yummy meal but not very satisfying. We liked that the dish was accompanied by a bread basket served with butter and jams. That gave us the opportunity to try out a selection of their breads, as they are primarily a bakery too. I probably wouldn't come back again for lunch/brunch, but I would like to see how their dinner menu compares as well as how the place turns into a bar in the evenings
3
I organized a gathering here for my group of friends (10 of us). The staff is very friendly but service quality is not very good. We had to keep track of our own orders and get the side plates ourselves even though we already told the waitress that we're sharing all the food we ordered. I noticed that though the next table (table of 6) ordered their food together, the time lag between food servings were so far apart that some folks finished eating before their friend's food arrived. So although the food is very nice, I may not come back.
1
We ordered two mains. One took about 20 minutes, the other about one hour. The restaurant was less than half full when we ordered. Turns out they had forgotten my order. The apologies were perfunctory and when I spoke to the manager at the end of the meai, he actually told me he hoped to see me again!I can only speak about the bistro section and not the bakery
4
Whenever I am free, I will be here for breakfast.There is outdoor and indoor sitting. The size of the place is decent.There is a range of food items on the menu for breakfast, lunch and desserts. I will always order their chocolate croissants (three mini pieces which is almost equivalent to a normal size chocolate croissant which you can find at other places) and a caffe latte. The croissants will always be heated up before it was served, it comes along with butter. Love the freshly baked croissants. Crispy! The caffe latte is decent too. Not too strong.It will be less than $10 for the items ordered.My husband will order a breakfast set which I feel is huge for me. If you are two ladies, you might just want to order an item to share first.There are carpark lots available. Alternatively, you can walk in from the main road.Good place to get fresh bakes :
4
My family loves checking out new breakfast places and Nassim Hill was a new place that we visited. For some reason even though we parked at the car park in the building, we ended up walking to the cafe/bakery through the back door which is quite weird.Breakfast overall was good. The French toasts were to die for. Service is good.. I had the impression that they have quite a lot of wait staff and not that much to do.The location of the cafe was also central and convenient. There is a meat market next door that sells interesting produce that you don't get from your regular grocer which makes the visit to the cafe interesting
4
Everything on the menu looks so yummy. Do note that the portion is quite big for small eater. This is a place that I would definitely revisit whenever I'm back in Singapore.
4
Nice place for family meal. Staff service was good. Love their blueberry pancakes and steak & eggs. Will try their lunch one day.
4
A nice atmosphere cafe somewhat hidden in the Tanglin area. Generally good quality food for a relaxed, mid-range restaurant, but nothing truly special. Service is friendly but a bit slow; good deals with the 1-for-1 happy hour on beers and 1-for-1 mains with certain credit card
4
Nice place for brunch. Cheerful and spacious. Food and drinks met with expectations. I like the pasta with the prawns. Juicy and flavorful prawns. The speculoos that accompany the hot beverages was very addictive. I bought a bag of these speculoos home. That's $12.00. I also took away 2 slices of chocolate cakes and was surprised it's $9.00 a slice. Ouch. Most cakes at cafes are about $6.00. Are they charging Nassim Hill expatriate prices
2
Went during off peak in afternoon and peak season at night. Bad:- Service was not consistent and staff are not attentive and always seems to be gathering at the counter to chat. - Crew at our table was cold and not impressed with their attitude service.- Tried Fish and feedback it was not fresh to crew. No action was made by kitchen nor crew.- Parking is a problem.Good:- Food presentation was excellent. - Atmosphere and place were nice.I am not sure why its crowded given the price and service, i wont be back. Spend your money elsewhere
4
Great place for daytime eats with family and friends. You'll find all your breakfast and brunch favourites are on the menu. Forget about fancy drinks, we ordered Bellini's and this put staff on the wrong foot. Outside terrace does not offer much in terms of view, but you can bring your dog along, a great boon in Singapore
4
Located at the tanglin post office, walking distance if taking public transport.pet friendly cafe for outdoor sitting, serve great food and drink. Went on sat night for dinner, it was crowded inside and staffs are busy serving the customers, so be prepare to have some patience if sitting outdoo
4
Went on a Saturday afternoon, well it is expected to be crowded as it is the weekends, food was served pretty quickly and for a second i thought the quality would be compromise. Pan cakes and waffle that was ordered turned out to be quite to our liking. Definitely will be back on a weekday as it is too noisy to hold a conversation when there is so much people in there

Nassim Hill Bakery is located at Tanglin Post Office, a rather iconic building at the edge of Orchard Road. With a comprehensive drinks list and beer and apple cider on taps, Nassim Hill Bakery is more than just a bakery - it is an energetic chilling out haven with good music and array of European magazines amidst its dim, comfortable decor in the spacious bistro.We started with one of their signature items - Guinness Stout Bread(SGD$8.00), malt-flavoured, infused beautifully with the bittersweetness of the dark beer we all know so well; this fluffy bread goes perfectly well with butter or marmalade.Next, we had the Market Fresh Mussels with a hint of Chilli (SGD$25.00), 250grams of French Bouchot mussels are cooked with white wine, Sriracha butter cilantro and garlic and served with crispy baguette on the side. The tiny, sweet mussels were squishy with flavourful gravy, tinged with a little hint of chilli as promised; the gravy was so good, we were still taking turns to consume it long after the mussels were gone.The Kale Caesar (SGD$17.00) in creamy anchovy dressing, sliced hard-boiled eggs, prosciutto chips, parmesan crumbs and sliced garlic croutons - was something new. It was the first time I ate kale - one of the much-loved superfoods in the western parts of the globe, a very healthy and nutrients-rich vegetable, and I can see why it is being loved. A Caesar without the usual refreshing leaves of lettuce, but replaced by crispy sprigs of kale that gave a good bite and gentle "green" favour; nothing too overpowering - a little like eating the top part of brocooli, only leafier. I loved the prosciutto chips too, so this great-tasting salad made it to my list of "must order" when I revisit.Moving on, Chilli Crab Pasta (SGD$16.00 for half-sized / SGD$25.00 for full-sized) - jumbo lump crab meat sautéed with own spicy and tangy chilli crab sauce on spaghetti. The springy strands of pasta was good with bite, as is the robustness of the thick sauce - a local delight, infused with sweet crab meat and spiciness. The gravy was so good, I couldn't resist dipping baguette bread into it to soak up the goodness; however I also feel that the pasta can do with less sauce because it was a little "wet", like being drenched in soup.I really dug this Triple X Chocolate Cake (SGD$9.00) - rich, lavish slice of moist chocolate cake infused beautifully with triple sec, giving it a bittersweet flavour amidst the aroma of chocolate, well executed with a solid base and gentle interior.Then there was Pear Cheddar Crumble (SGD$11.00) stoking one's immediate passion for its baked pear, gelato scoop and crispy cheese biscuits on the side, satiating the palate in terms of texture and taste.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/08/media-invite-dinner-at-nassim-hill.htm

This restaurant is located at the Tanglin Post Office, at the rear of the building. Parking is convenient with limited lots in front of the restaurant and underground carpark lots also available. I came for dinner with a group of friends. We were seated at a large wooden table that’s good for communal sharing of food and conversation.We ordered from across the menu and here are the highlights of our meal:Salads- Kale Caesar: $17. Its my first time trying kale, which is a super vegetable. I liked the prosciutto chip, which is fried prosciutto ham and the creamy anchovy dressing. - Asian BBQ Chicken: $15. Grilled chicken atop assorted salad vegetables, which indluced edaname beans. The soy ginger dressing is served on the side, so you add to your liking. We ordered several Sharing Plates & Mains:- Poutine: $13. Fries with house made entrecote sauce, minced beef and shredded mozzarella cheese. There was sauce at the bottom of the bowl which was full of umami, cos its made with anchovy sauce!- Popcorn Chicken Bites: $12. Cubed chicken bits coated with batter and deep fried. I liked the pieces with chicken skin on cos they were nice and crispy. Its drizzled with Sriracha Aiolo, thin-sliced fresh baby radish and topped with sesame seeds. Nice.- Soft Shelled Crab: $13. Batter is light and coats the crab well, making it crispy. The remoulade chive sauce pairs well with the crab.- Cheddar Cheese Bacon Waffles: $19. This is a must-order! The waffles are made to order and they have bacon bits in them. The chive cream cheese to pair with it was so good. It comes with bacon rashes to make this a complete meal on its own. - Mussels with a hint of chilli: $25. Live French bouchot mussels cooked with white wine, garlic, Sriracha butter cilantro. This was served with house baked baguette. Finished in no time. - Grilled Grain fed Angus T-bone steak and arugula: $65. This is a house special. 500gm of beef grilled with a side of rocket salad. Its medium, so you can taste the beef. I finished off the bits on the bone at the end. - Tonkatsu: $21. Panko crusted pork loin topped with a sous vide egg. Came with a side of red cabbage slaw. Cut the egg and let the yolk flow over the Tonkatsu. - Chilli Crab Pasta: $25. This was spaghetti with jumbo lump crab cooked in a spicy and tangy chilli crab sauce. This was popular amongst my group and its finished in no time.For Dessert, we had:- Carrot Cake: $8. Chockful of nuts and dried fruits. Every mouthful was good. Would love to have more cream cheese in between and outside the cake, so it can have a richer taste.- Pear Cheddar Crumble: $11. Light and crunchy cheddar crumble with pecans and cheddar cheese, with warm pear compote and vanilla ice cream. It’s a unique dessert, which I will order again. Not bad. - Triple X (with Triple Sec): $9. Chocolate sponge cake made with a dark rich chocolate ganache and triple sec. Liked this dessert, cos the bottom of the dessert is soaked with Triple Sec. Nice.Drinks- Yuzu Breeze: $19. Prosecco, Pimm’s No 1, Yuzu and Soda water. There’s quite a fair bit of cut orange pieces in it, making it have a more orangey taste. so I couldn’t taste the yuzu in the drink, which is a pity. - Dirty Sriracha Bloody Mary: $17. Absolut Elyx Vodka, Peach Shnapps, fresh lemon juice, honey and mint. There were 3 cherry tomatoes skewered on a toothpick and its topped with Sriracha chilli sauce. The tomatoes with chilli sauce was really spicy, which made me drink more of the cocktail. - Erdinger Beer: $11. Fresh from the tap. Beer is cloudy and easy to drink. Lovely. Ended the night with a shot of Nikka Single Malt ‘Miyagikyo’ 15 year old whisky. I had this on the rocks, smooth and easy to drink.The portions are generous and its good to have more friends so you can order more food to share.It was a good meal, and now I know a good place to dine and also to pick up nice freshly-baked breads
4
Good place for sandwiches and salads. Quite big portions. Good environment. Bit of noisy but tolerable. Only wish the air-cond is much cooler.
3
Went there with my girlfriends and thank God we made reservations else we will be waiting ages for a seat. Service is not too bad for a very crowded place, our food took us 30mins waiting time. We ordered prawn Aglio olio which taste quite nice and the cheese waffles. However the price on the other hand is not really worth it for the food.
5
All Day Breakfast (before 4pm)Excellent venue for an afternoon All Day Breakfast. Second time here and, as before, it's a relaxing experience.The staff always so relaxed and professional, couldn't be more helpful.Food choice is excellent and the product delicious (Hearty Scrambled Eggs) very very tasty and hearty.The place is very popular, mostly young local crowd and may seem a little noisy - but just chill here for an hour or so. It's worth it!
3
I visited around September last year and was very disappointed - several items not on menu and inattentive and generally poor service.During a visit in June 2015, service was better, and more in line with other similar establishments. This was early evening which may have helped, but the manager seemed to be attentive and making sure his staff were serving properly. Food on menu was available, although I personally didn't enjoy the distinctive sauce on the burger.Overall though, now a reasonable place to have food and drink, with competitive prices and relaxed atmosphere
4
My friend booked table for 5 through online reservation. However when one friend arrived, seemed reservation not registered. Anyway seated immediately and rest of group arrived. Nobody came to our table till we waved. It was Friday night and the place started filling up. We placed our drinks and food orders. Food arrived a while later but no drinks arrived. Had to ask the ever smiling waiter to check drinks orders. Drinks arrived soon afterwards. Food was generally good with chilli crab pasta, good burger, steak was so so. Desserts were also good (waffle and brownie). Cider was good. The place was noisy and we were sitting in front (v near) a big group with some special occasion making (loud) speeches etc. The place is more suited to causal gatherings and friends get-together with a good cider and causal dinner. 5 of us ate $189 (10% off DBS card) which was reasonable for 5 mains, 5 alcoholic drinks, 2 dessert, 1 coffee. Service can be better though
2
I came here for brunch on a Sunday with my mother and aunt. We ordered steak and eggs, skillet eggs, sweet potato fries, and the artisanal bread basket.The good:Great ambianceSweet potato fries were delicious and served with a tasty lime aioli The bad:Service is EXTREMELY slow. Took 20 min for the bread basket to come out. My skillet eggs never came out; after following up twice after almost an hour the server finally said my order was forgotten. The server was extremely apologetic and took 15% off the bill. I did however cancel the skillet eggs as it was so late that my mother and aunt had already finished their meal. While I appreciate the gesture of 15% off I still do not plan on returning.
1
Staff totally not friendly. You have to wait long time for food. Staff doesn't try to help in any situation. They never try to suit your requests.
4
We went there for dinner to celebrate my son's birthday. Ordered the truffle fries to share. It was yummy, but a tad pricey at $12. My son ordered the Steak and Eggs which he enjoyed. Hubby had the DIY Steak Sandwich ($22) which he thoroughly enjoyed as well. I had the chili crab pasta (full portion at $25) which packed a punch, was rich in flavour and had a generous serving of crab meat sauce. I loved it! My girls shared a Carbonara (full portion at $21, i think) which had generous portions of bacon and a rich creamy sauce. They was none leftover! Overall, with two drinks (a draft beer for hubby ($11) and an apple cider for me ($10) - happy hour prices), our meal came to about $94, after taxes. Firstly, because there is no 10% service charge. Secondly, because we used our Entertainer app to get our 1-for-1 deal. So we only paid for the two more expensive mains, out of the four. I'll be back again - but only because we have one more entertainer app voucher to use. Otherwise, I'd find the meal a tad pricey. Oh, if you have the POSB or DBS credit card, you can also enjoy the 1-for-1 promotion. But you'd need to order a drink as well, to enjoy the promo. I like that this place serves free flow of ice water - self-service, of course
3
We ordered one burger, one sandwich, one pasta and one pizza. The burger is on the oil side, the sandwich is dry, the pasta though flavorful is too salty for me and the pizza is really messy to eat and again it's salty. The ambience is good. We did not try to drinks. Not in the mood after the food.
5
A rarity in Singapore where a 10% service charge is automatically (and cheekily) added to the bill. This place claims to be one of just nineteen places in Singapore not to add a service charge. So!So I added 20% in cash due to the variety, price and service. Great breakfast and hidden away behind the post office, next door to the Swiss Butchery. Well worth the visit
4
The waffles are crispy and flavorful! Try them! It's worth the money.
Parking space is limited though. They have about 10 lots for drivers.
3
The food and atmosphere is great. Unfortunately, the service is unresponsive and unearnest, despite a very slow day.
2
We've been regulars but over the past six months things have changed in the kitchen. The food is not as good as before and the service is slow. In the positives, the atmosphere is great and the people friendly.
2
The Detox Salad. Came without the avocado which happened to be the reason why I ordered this dish. They failed to tell us that and served it none the less. Upon request, the manager came out to explain that they ran out of avocados. Why did the kitchen not inform the staff and proceeded to serve the dish? The manager was not apologetic but did offer to add grilled chicken or prawns. S$15.00Enjoyed the chili crab pasta. The portion was just right for the price and they had a generous amount of crab. Satisfied. S$25.00Fish & Chips. Ordinary and poor quality fish. Not worth the price. S$23.00In general service is average. However, I will unlikely go again.
5
I loved this place. The food was great, the service wonderful and the bread - out of this world.Went there for dinner with my best friend. We shared the cheese platter, she got steak and eggs, and I got the half-portion of chili crab spaghetti (but changed to penne, because I'm not a fan of spaghetti) which was just enough for me. We also got the Pear Crumble for dessert.The meal came with a small bread basket that included a cinnamon roll that was absolutely divine. I only wish there was more of it!Service was great, and all the staff friendly. We didn't realize till the end that there was a 1-for-1 promotion for DBS and POSB card holders (for the main course) so that was a nice treat. We spent $77 between the two of us for a really nice dinner, which was slightly less than I expected to pay.I really want to go back to try their brunch menu. I hear the Hot Reuben is divine, as is their Mac and Cheese - so I definitely know what I'm trying next time
4
The breakfast was great - all around - only problem was that if you are paying $100 for a breakfast for your family of five you might expect it would come with attentive, friendly service. Example: when we ask for water, they just point to the cooler where we go and get it ourselves. Come on - you are too expensive for that
2
We were expecting a pleasant brunch/lunch..but experience was disappointing. We ordered house signature cocktails to start. Server's reaction to our query on whether the correct cocktail was served (as the taste didnt seem to correspond to described ingredients) was surprisingly defensive and we were told (yes, told and instructed) to order another drink because "the bartender is already very stressed". Okay...Order for mojito became mojito green tea.. Clarified during order that we are ordening a cocktail not the tea but still came wrong.Greens in salad and mint leaves used as cocktail embellishments were tired looking with blackened edges. Obviously not suitable for serving. This was the second visit. No thanks to more
3
I've reviewed this restaurant twice before. When it first opened, it was terrible - service was very bad; food was below average. Service staff were not well trained at all. I will spare this review though of the terrible experiences of old. Now-a-days, the management seems to have grasped what it takes to run a decent cafÃ©, serving fairly decent food. My all time favourite salad in the city is NHB's "Asian Chicken Salad" - I love texture in my food - and this salad satisfies this need for me...it's a delicious blend of romaine, napa cabbage, edamae, mandarin orange segments, slivered almonds, crunchy red peppers and crunchy wonton strips, to which you MUST add their sesame dressing - yummy! Thank you Chef!Service has improved - but the wait staff are not pro-active i.e. they should scan tables of dining patrons, rather than stand around. I've all too often seen patrons, myself included, waving frantically to flag them down. One lunch hour, I was horrified to see two staff members sleeping with their heads on the table where people dine - seriously? for all to see - NOT a good look for a restaurant business. Management - what are you thinking
4
My 2nd year in a row spending X'mas in Nassim Hill Bakery . Enjoyed that this place is away from the hustle and bustle despite being in the city ( albeit a little harder to get to...)They have very good food ; keeping the price affordable even though it is on a Christmas Day ( + a 10% credit card promotion) . However , service was a bit slow but there WAS a sizeable crowd. Would not generally come back here often due to location but it was nice and spacious. One of the better brunch places.. .hmm...perhaps I might return for Xmas again for the 3rd time ?    
4
We had the Asian chicken salad which was mediocre and the chilli crab pasta which was quite delicious.As it was lunchtime on a weekday it was extremely crowded and I spent 15-20 mins waiting for a car park lot. It is easy to miss this place if you were coming from tanglin road or orchard boulevard. Just look out for the tanglin post office.Service was slow and andhad to refill our water on our own not withstanding that it is hard to walk to the water point will the restaurant packed with prams and chairs next to one another.Hope the management can work on the sitting arrangements
5
Awesome food. Good service. However, as i made reservation through Chope, they didn't have a record.
5
Staff was very friendly and the food was awesome! Reasonable pricing and taste yummy. Definitely will come back again.
4
Been there 3 times for the past 2 months... Loved the 1 for 1 offer...the lamb cutlet was awesome, perfectly cooked! The chilli crab pasta is just like having the real deal, generous portion of real crab meat. Also tried the breakfast...scrambled eggs and it comes with 3 different type of bread, warm and toasted.... Hopefully they will continue with the 1 for 1 offer.... The down side: service was a little slow as it was full house
4
This is a little bit of a gem in Tanglin. Food was good, perhaps a little on the expensive side. However drink was by Sing standards reasonable - nice ambience.The big plus however was that service charge was not included - this meant that the serving staff were actually attentive and friendly. They also (take note virtually every other restaurant in Singapore) brought the right courses to everyone at the same time! Magic.We will be back
3
Saw many review said it's a nice place. So reserve a table to celebrate my buddy's birthday. Atmosphere not too bad with a nice deco.The food i order was the fish & chip, chilli crab pasta, Spaghetti Carbonara, Cheddar cheese bacon waffle and Summer Sangria Pitcher. Overall the food was average, but my buddy said the chilli crab nice.Now i would like to mention the service, not too good. I having difficulty getting attention from the staffs. I almost want to use a bell to catch their attention. I just hope my next visit there will be an improvement.
4
Had dinner here before adjourning to a friend's place next door. Was pleasantly surprised by the 1-for-1 dinner deal with DBS credit card. The Steak & Eggs was recommended and most of us took it. It was good. Another had the chilli crab pasta and he loved it. There was also happy hour drinks before 8, and we all had wine, beers and ciders , which were appreciatedService was done by a team of teenagers or young adults, so service was either odd or not michelin-star. But it wasn't overly frustrating since it was a casual ambience and meals were half-price. Reviewers who are too uptight may get upset with the serviceOverall a good place if you're here for the dinner promotion

Went for breakfast with family this morning. Service was slow as the crowd grew which was still tolerable but the staff certainly needs more training. Twice I signaled to a particular staff and twice I was ignore despite being aware that I was in need of attention. Food in my personal opinion also did not match the premium pricing. When I commented to Kenny the manager when paying my bill which I had to personally go up to them at the payment counter since I was not given much attention he shrugged and was not able to give a reply. Not sure about lunch or dinner but my advice skip this place if you want to go for breakfast and only if you have lots of money to burn

Great chili crab pasta, spaghetti and mushroom and po boy sandwich. Casual eatery that is a little noisy but this adds to the relaxed atmosphere. Good selection of beers and ciders that complement the food well.We ended the meal with a small chocolate cake loaf - Delectable!Also picked up a cheese loaf that was the best I've had - Highly recommended!The waitress was so helpful and friendly

My personal judgement is that Nassim Hill Bakery takes pride in their work, judging from the service that tries their best to attend to our needs, a delicious selection in the menu, and quality products and bread made in-house. I feel comfortable in the space because it's real and isn't too pretentious, its just there to serve good food and drinks for a good night.

Although Nassim Hill Bakery is not the most convenient deli in town, it is a must-go for food gourmands. I absolutely love a few of their dishes like the Steak and Eggs, Salmon Omelette, Hot Reuben Sandwich and Chilli Crab Pasta. Their serving sizes are well-proportioned, and also ideal for sharing. Even their breads, especially the almond brioche is very delicious. The only downside is that the portion of the Eggs Benedict is rather small and is not as fantastic as many others that I have tried before.Nonetheless, this is a great place for amazing food! Though a little pricey, I will still recommend

had a wonderful dinner with my wife at nassim hill bakery last evening on 5.10.2014. last came here for an ok not-too-bad average family afternoon tea on 6.4.2014.they have an ongoing 1 for 1 promotion for DBS cards from 6pm onwards, until end nov2014.we ordered a D-I-Y steak sandwich (menu price S$22) and a crab spaghetti arrabiata (spicy tomatoes) main course portion (menu price S$24). also added a white for S$10 happy hour price (till 8pm).the D-I-Y steak sandwich – S$22 was fabulous, much better quality than we expected from a cafe, very much good restaurant standard & quite worthy of S$22 full price. it was sweet, tender, nicely medium rare. the toasted baguette was great & the english & french mustards dip made the whole experience even better. it was truly a D-I-Y steak sandwich! kudos to the chef! the crab spaghetti arrabiata (spicy tomatoes) was very good too. a good portion, quite spicy which i loved & loads of crab meat. good canned crab meat is very expensive & fresh ones too. so the dish was fairly priced at S$24 even at full price. for me of course a good steak sandwich always prime a good pasta. with the 1 for 1 discounts, the 2 items were just S$24++ excluding the S$10++ white. incredible deal really!service was kind of below par – polite & not unfriendly, but kind of inattentive & untrained. small disadvantage c/w with the food deal. see my flu reviews & photos at http://chefquak.com/2014/10/06/good-super-value-dinner-nassim-hill-bakery-on-5oct2014

Nassim Hill was the first restaurant I visited when moving to Singapore a year ago, and we've been back several times since. It's best known for brunch, and its selection is similar to San Francisco spots I'm used to with artisan, home made beer breads and hormone free eggs. The granola parfait is delicious, filling and a relatively healthy option, though they do have good salads too. The location is a bit hidden, behind the Sing Post office off Tanglin Road, but very accessible if you look for it. The decor is hip and open-feeling. Gets busy at brunch time so book ahead and don't be in a rush

I went to the NH for dinner with my wife, mom, Dad and the 2 month year old baby.The sangria was really good and so was most of the other mains we ordered. The staff who were in hurry to end the shift weren't that friendly but few others were very friendly and cooperative.We would definitely go there again

My husband and I read about this cafe cum bakery on a blog and decided to give it a try for brunch. It has a beautiful setting with what looks like a small but fabulous looking artisan bakery. We were looking for a western styled cafe and Nassim Hill was a beautiful choice. The menu was extensive for-brunch and an egg lovers paradise. I ordered the Egg Skillet which was devine. It had 2 soft eggs in a chorizo huevos style mix which was amazing. My husband had eggs benedict which he enjoyed. The coffee was ok but wouldn't rave about it. The service was good given all tables were full and people were coming and going.

daughter wanted to try nassim hill bakery for afternoon tea. we bought stamps at the tanglin post office next door a month back but did not try out this place.all day breakfast, egg bens, burgers & sandwiches & hip cafes do not hold any particular attraction for me though i do agree that some are pretty ok & a good departure from the usual stuff i take, and i am quite able to enjoy them if good even if not my preferred. the hot reuben was a favourite here. though for me it was more like what else was there to order here? i could just see perhaps a grilled chicken salad or grilled chicken sandwich…pizzas not our favourite, & pasta sorry to think this way but i probably do them better myself. in any case probably wouldn’t order these items in a cafe unless some close friends really vouched for them.turned out that the hot reuben sandwich was really quite good, and quite a good helping for S$18. corn beef (which i always associate with luncheon meat, a favourite to steam on top of the cooked rice in a rice cooker when i was studying abroad 30++years ago) was good & the sauerkraut was not sour & went well with the meat & bread. not something i could finish by myself. we shared among 4pax. good thing here was that when you ordered a main, you could order a soup (usual S$6), coffee/tea (usual S$5/S$6) or soft drink (we were not interested) for S$3. so we added a flat white, a mint tea & a soup (carrot soup, above photo) for S$3 for each item.the ambience was great! parking was limited but we were able to park right outside the cafe on a sunday afternoon. we added an apple crumble (carrot cake was a favourite here but we look at the cake tray & it did not excite us). this was good – crumb was good, apple was not too sweet, the cake layer was a bit large. reminded me of my jam crumb cake, a recipe i picked up recently rather successfully. coffee/flat white was ok, kind of average. the ones we had recently at costa were quite a bit better.service was a bit sloppy – forgot our soup order completely, and after waited long after we finished the hot reuben & coffee, took another inordinately long time to make right & service recovery, and did not make effort to offer a smile or friendly apology though overall the staff were quite polite but NOT attentive! after soup was finally served, took another long time to serve the apple crumble saying they thought we had canceled the cake (why make such assumptions on behalf of customer? if not, why use it as an excuse? better to just say sorry & make good). i guess it was quite ok, average, could be worse in some places.the orders for 4pax was S$38nett so it was pretty ok though we ordered not so many items.maybe once in a while, i might do this with some one who like the ambience & share the pretty ok food

What does one make of this informal place with fabulous- tasting pasta, breads & dessert but a very 'so-so' service performance! This place dishes out mouthwatering olive oil pasta, heavenly breads & esoteric dessert items, only to counterbalance serving one drink less & one dessert less for our group of six! Also their famed pizza fare is available only after 1400 Hrs...so watch out if you desire a bite early afternoon. All said & done, will I come back? For sure....my taste buds rule!

After a string of good meals out in Singapore, where the service was exceptional, I was beginning to think Singapore might have finally solved the problem so prevalent in Asia, where the service staff are either completely uninterested (or incompetent), or overly attentive - removing your plate halfway through your meal, or filling your wine glass up between every mouthful etc.Thankfully Nassim Hill Bakery has managed to buck the trend, and offers the hopeless service that I thought was a distant memory in the Lion city.Having now eaten there several times, I know that the staff are completely overwhelmed if more than one table is full. It was good to hear the phrase "finish already" when ordering off the menu, and being told the coffee was going to be a long wait because there was only one Barista.When your meals are available and do arrive, they are uniformly cold, though one must admit they are well presented and taste quite good - if you can stomach the odd icy poached egg or two.When the Barista manages to churn out your coffee, they are also pretty good.This place has potential, but needs to sort it's staff out

Not sure if the management has changed but the whole team certainly has. This used to be a lovely place run by a very friendly and efficient team with excellent food, but has become just another place with salads and sandwiches. Outdoor seating would have been peaceful and charming if not for the continuous string of smokers parking themselves next to your table to puff away, dog owners bringing their dogs to bark away at anyone walking past and car owners leaving their cars revving next to your tables.

This hipster cafe is tucked away across the street from the Tanglin Mall, on the back of the building with the Swiss butchery. It is a quieter place than the cafes in the Tanglin Mall, albeit parking is a nightmare to find. As such it is a great meeting place when you want to have an actual conversation. Otherwise, there is nothing extraordinary about it
