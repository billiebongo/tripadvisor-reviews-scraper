Bit quiet for Friday night which was excellent for conversations. Fish head soup has always been as good, and loved the belachan chicken wings! Taro desert was also amazing too. They had quite a few things sold out though, hence the 4/5 rating.

Favourite fish slice beehoon and pork ribs! Went with some friends and enjoyed our food very much. Service was also good.
5
Affordable comfort food with nostalgic feel. The taste remains unchanged all these years. The comprehensive menu never fails to satisfy my entire family of 3 generations
4
Food has maintained its standards despite so many years. But the price is also as usual expensive. For a bowl of the noodles (5-6pax), then three small dishes, it costs over 150.

although food was abit salty but have the wok taste. overall good experience and place was not too crowded.

Michelin one star restaurant, I came here with my family during Chinese New Year. Nice ambience with great service. With free parking definitely a great place with family or even hosting guest from overseas. Food is great and I love the ‚Äúpork chop‚Äù with self made sauce, it gives you a different taste buds. The other I love is their ‰∏âÊíàÊ≤≥Á≤â, flat rice noodle, greatly fried and wok hey

A must try place if you like sliced fish ... the food quality is excellent.. the sliced fish is fresh, not like what you get at lots of other places. Another must try is the prawn paste chicken - the batter Is really good, very crispy. The service was pretty ok. Location is within walking distance from Outram mrt station. Will definitely return.
1
Dining in the restaurant will cause you to smell of food as the ventilation is poor. Restaurant is virtually not furnished and certainly not meeting ‚Äòrestaurant‚Äô grade, more like a neighbourhood eating place. Taste of food is nothing spectacular, not value for the money paid. As it is not conveniently located, it‚Äôs not worth finding your way there.

I have chope the reservation and upon arrival I standing at the door way for the staff to attend to me. We have waited for couple of minutes still no one come to attend to us , therefore we have to find our own seat, as we walk in than a service staff approached us. They just simply ignoring guests who are standing at the waiting to be seated area

Although their claim to fame is their sliced fish bee hoon, the San Lou Hor Fun I tried this time was really good with a nice wok hei to the hor fun. My companion liked his Yue Guang He as well. The prawn paste chicken is one of the best variations I‚Äôve tried. The crab tofu they recommended was rather insipid though.
4
Location of the restaurant was not very accessible by public transport, but ample parking lots are available for those who drive.
Food was of good standard and serving size was just right.
Service was a tad slow as the restaurant becomes more crowded.
4
Ordered fish beehoon soup and sambal fried rice, both are great. Sliced fish are fresh and plentiful, price reasonable for restaurant.
4
fish soup is good.with lots of Hua Diao Jiu.
stir fried youmaicai (Ê≤πÈ∫¶Ëèú) in fermented beancurd is a unique dish.
5
yum yum, love their sliced fish thick bee hoon soup! Especially the soup base! Definitely will go back again!

Restaurant was not operating but yet I was able to make reservation n was given an email confirmation too üò§
Went there all the way from Seletar some more to have dinner with family üò°
3
The price for the food we ordered is acceptable.
The prawn sauce fried chicken is fantastic and not to be missed.
I like the deep fried bee hoon sea food is very good.
The fish been hoon is excellent
4
This restaurant has been around for a long time. My family went there to try what they are well known for - fish soup or beehoon, har cheong kai, cereal prawns and a vegetable dish. They were yummy. Parking is in the compound. Recommended.
5
We went after seeing the many good reviews on Chope. Indeed, the fish slices noodles were great! Soup was flavourful and not too salty. Highly recommend!
4
Unassuming location near Singapore General Hospital. But this place boasts a bib gourmand award. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve since tried to spruce this place up. Hence the numerous complains of closure. Food is good. Try their famous fish head noodle soup and beef hor fun are definitely must tries. Other dishes I would try would be the har cheong gai and frog legs. For dessert - an interesting twist to the teochew dish, fried yam paste
1
Restaurant not in operation and yet my reservation was accepted and confirmed by email! We went to restaurant to find out that it was closed for renovation. No one contacted us regarding this and we still received the confirmation of our dinner reservation. Family gathering dinner plans disrupted and we did not even get to try the foo

Fish soup was tasty. The prawn paste chicken yummy. Liked the achar snack as well. Nice meal when you want something comforting.
4
traditional settings, good and tasty fish soup. cheap and affordable. highly recommended to make reservations before going.

My first visit to Ka Soh Seafood Restaurant and found the fish bee hoon very gingery, which is fine if you love ginger! Tried the prawn paste chicken too - I would recommend this dish!
5
Absolutely love the fish soup bee hoon. The flavours are in perfect harmony though it could be further enhanced if it is cooked with a little ginger.
4
Very rustic decor. Not many restautants like this! Feels like a step through time. The fish noodle soup was above average! Worth 1 try
3
Food was not as good as expected although they made it to Michelin Guide. We over ordered and I feel they should have told us to avoid wastage.
2
First time there with all the hype about its Michelin Bib but it was terrible.First, fish soup the most popular item have the soup base taste so fishy of stale fish.When you bite on the flesh of the fish, it tell you straight away the fish is stale.Some would argue thats the authentic taste , but not my family. Eaten fish soup thru the years, this definitely terrible.The price of other items were over priced and portion real small !! Even medium portion feed 2 atmost. Prawn paste chicken was good but its price per piece. Portion for garlic vege is pathetic, even economy rice store give bigger portion. Service was average with 1 particular staff giving attitude if you take abit time to decide, looking at the ceiling or looking for customer to call so she call step away.
3
Located within the hospital grounds but isn't really well sign-posted. It is not close to any bus stop or the MTR. The decor is very tired with worn out red carpet, different coloured 'white' lights, and random fan placements. The food however was good enough to distract from these issues although that may not be enough to attract us there again
3
The food is good but I doubt the Michelin star rating. It is above average no doubt but I don't think it deserve the Michelin rating. Food is also priced slightly on the above normal but not hit that high range. Service is good and fast. However, the setting and atmosphere is old wasn't what I was expecting. So if you want to bring overseas guest, I think other places is nicer. If you just want to gather with close friends and family then yes this is a good place albeit the inconvenience to get to the venue especially for those who are not driving. It is about a 12-15mins walk from the Outram MRT station so those not driving do take note! Otherwise I give a 6.5/10 for overall rating

I remembered we visited here once during Mother's Day 2 or 3 years back. We didn't patronise it until now for a good reason.We saw it's 14th position in the Singapore Michelin Guide 2017 and decided to give it a try again.We (5 adults with a child) ordered their signature dishes including the fish soup ($38 for 6pax), prawn paste chicken ($15.50 small size), spare pork ribs ($18.50), oatmeal prawn balls ($38 medium size), and toufu with crabmeat ($27).First and foremost, we do not understand why is their sliced fish soup so famous/popular. We can not find any reason to come back again for this. Toufu with crabmeat is another disappointment, which we think our helper can do better too! Worst of all is their oatmeal prawn. Their chef was very generous with the oatmeal but this dish is simply TOO salty! The waitress came to inform us that their chef was able to cook another plate for us again when we were almost done with our dinner. A nice gesture but I think we would like to return again in a few years time.A good experience for us to re-visit here again. For those who have not tried, it's good to experience it yourself

Many people's favourite and easy to see why. Prices are reasonable, quality has remained consistent over the years. Sense of nostalgia and comfort whenever you need it. Fish soup is a must have.
3
the soup was rich and tasty, but the fish slices were very thin and had a strong fishy taste. more vegetables would have balanced the meal better.
4
Food is good but the restaurant kind of run down. Service is ok with friendly staff. Should work on the physical state of the premises
1
Aircon was down and no fan support. Staff all stand at counter to blow their mini fan. Should standby blower for such issue. They didn't even bother if I have any reservations
2
The food is good but aircon is not working. Should have told us when we called to confirm the reservation.
3
Came here for lunch with colleagues. First of all, aircon is mostly not working and it gets really warm during lunch hours in a sunny day. There are also not enough fans for every table. A renovation is way overdue as the place is very rundown. Service is so-so... let's just say you're request will eventually get fulfilled. Fish head soup noodle is overrated but the fried hor fun and other wok-fried food is pretty decent. Our shirts were all wet when we leave.
4
A friend who grew up in Singapore brought me here to try some of his friends' regular haunts. We had the fish belly, the 3-times-rinse noodles, and some other things. Food came out fast and service was good. For Singapore, the price was fine. Only major problem is that many of the staff mainly speak Mandarin, and the menu can be hard to follow in English. Some fun pictures of celebrity visitors (ex: Jackie Chan) lend credence to the authenticity of this place
5
For any visitors to Singapore, try the shrimp paste fried chicken. For me, it's the best fried chicken I've tasted anywhere and I LOVE my fried chicken. This place is old school local Cantonese style food. A bit off the beaten track but it's probably about 15 mins by cab from Orchard Road. It's also very good value. You can get a great meal for about S$20 per head
4
The place was unexpectedly deserted form the outside, the building so dated. But the food was so delicious. The fish broth was rich and felt like it was brewed for a long time. The har cheong chicken wasn't too bad and the crab toufu had real crab pieces not surimi.
4
This branch of Ka-Soh is situated in a small corner of the Singapore medical association building. The deco is drab and very aged. The chairs are literally from Ikea. There is a strong smell of oil lingering in the air. Not a place for your first date....HOWEVER, if you can look beyond those non critical details, the food is absolutely amazing! Had the famous prawn paste chicken - crispy and full of flavor. Fried self made bean curd, 3 egg spinach, cereal prawns, hor fun and pork chops. Each dish full of "wok hei!"In summary, if you can look beyond the run down premises there is a treasure of a restaurant with excellent food awaiting. The standard has been maintained all these years.
3
Their standard drop so much... I was thinking of giving a 2 star rating but gave a 3 for old time seek.
Their fish is no longer tasty and sweet... Meat is rough and tasteless.
Hope they can get their act together again.
5
Great place to eat. Lovely food - liked the fish with noodles and chicken covered with shrimp and fried. Not the sort of place an Ang Mo usually goes I suspect - found thanks to my Singaporean wonder-friend.

I come with high expectation because the dish I'm ordering is their signature offering.Ordered their sliced fish beehoon soup for lunch. First mistake: gave me a small plate of red mixed with green cut chilli. Isn't it elementary knowledge that only red chilli is to be used for this dish? Now for the dish itself: soup is significantly more bland compared to my last visit few years ago. I have since tasted similar offerings where the soup packs a formidable aromatic punch; this supposedly star dish pales by at least 50%. Fish slices are disappointingly thin.I'm curious to know how the restaurant continues to thrive

If you are coming here, get a bowl of fish head bee hoon soup, or sliced fish bee hoon soup if you do not want to work through the bones. The broth is flavourful, and they are generous with the fish. The other dishes such as the shrimp paste fried chicken or the pork ribs are also not bad and quite value for money. The whole steamed fish is quite pricey so don't order that if you are trying to keep the cost down. Other than that, most of the other dishes are relatively affordable, and taste quite good! Ordered 8 large dishes for 8 people and we finished everything

Initially I was really excited to bring my mom to try out the sliced fish soup after enjoying it many times at the Amoy st branch.But it was a horror..I'd ordered 2 bowls of the signature sliced fish soup. The whole dish was pungent smelling. I took a bite of the fish and felt like throwing up(I'm not pregnant neither was my mom).I immediately asked the staff about it. The lady told me it's supposed to be like this. I knew something was wrong with the dish and feel like asking her to taste it herself but did not want to make a big fuss over it, so I told her if she could put more ginger for us. The lady said she will throw in more ginger for us and re-boiled it. However that did not help much. The dish was still bad. We ended up just taking the veggies and sliced fish, leaving the whole bowl noodles and soup behind. My mom eats sliced fish soup her whole life and she could immediately tell that it was not fresh even before eating it.When I was paying the bill, the same lady apologized that we did not enjoy the dish and explained that her soup was made from fish bone and so the distinctive taste. I wanted to tell her that I had the same food many times at the Amoy st but they never taste like this before, but I find no point explaining. She did mentioned that hope we can return again to try other dishes. She was friendly and nice during the whole time. Unfortunately that did not help in "removing" the bad taste

I am a regular to this restaurant, and I make it a point to at least go there once a week. The key is to get the fish head version, and to get the thin bee hoon, which I believe gets more soup on the bee hoon with each gulp than the thick version. After your meal, you can head to the Tiong Bahru bao nearby for your dessert! Still the best bowl of fish head beehoon in Singapore, with the soup done the tradition way by boiling the fish bones for hours, rather than adding milk

Good food and excellent service. We had chicken hot pot and tofu vegetable dinner. The entrees were tasty and ample. The manager chatted with us for some time as tourists are not common here and most patrons are locals or visitors to the general hospital that is located next door. Decor is very plain - do not go for the ambiance. Go for the local food at good prices
3
The standard of the food is not even close to 10 years ago... the same goes for the priceThe fish bee hoon is not so tasty and the price of it has increased by a few dollarsI felt like the seafood tofu was full of flour and totally sickening and the beef kai lan was totally over priced and deserved to be removed from the menuAt the rate which the price is increasing, they should make this place into a fine dining restauran
4
I have visited this restaurant since I was a young boy. They serve local dishes and one of the best dishes is Fish Head Noodle Soup. I also like their Fried Kway Teow. The set up at Amoy Street is nostalgic and i believe they open till late. A good place to try local food at location. Enjoy!

Was here for lunch today after my chemo at SGH. Ordered their signature dish- Fish head Beehoon. The soup is thick but very stingy in thier soup. Fish was fresh & had it with bittergourd. Overall is ok only, had tried better ones in Chinatown. Tried thier chicken with yam pot, this is good to go with rice. Chicken is soft & yam melts in your mouth. Can try if you are there. Spinach is normal If you need somewhere to hve a place where you can spend sometime before yur appt in SGH, can give this restaurant a tinkle
