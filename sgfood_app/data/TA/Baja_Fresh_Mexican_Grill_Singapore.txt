Quite a nice place, well located too! Came here after watching a movie at Cineplex. The food's nice and the portions are big enough for the price tag. Would visit again for sure!
4
The food was amazing and so was the ambience. The staff was welcoming and friendly. I will come back here.
5
They have really good things to do in the restaurant. The food comes with nachos and are full of life.
5
Really good food, really good ambience, really good service, really good sauces, really good cutlery, really good music, really good food.
5
Food was amazing and portion was really good. Location is really good and everyone had a lot of fun.
5
nice & really
great food. Cozy place. if you’ve been craving for mexican food, this is the perfect place.
5
The burritos are always delicious, particularly the ultimo. When I need comfort food, I head right over to Baja.
3
We tried the chicken quesadilla, fish fajita and cheese nachos. It was decent texmex style food. The frozen magarita was tart and lacked any tequila. It is better to avoid. The ambience is more like a cafetaria than a restaurant. Open 24hours on most days.
5
Good comfort food! I definitely recommended the Quesadilla! A bit pricey but worth it! There’s free flow of salsa and good drinks too!
5
The restaurant is a little pricey, but it’s very convenient and tasty. I personally loved the Baja burrito!
4
Ordering is easy, kinda expensive but burritos are very good. Salsa is very good, they don’t give you enough chips though
5
Lovely! Enjoyed it and reminds me of the US! It was great it was my third time here and will always come back!
5
Tostada salad is highly recommended. Higly recommend the place. Nice food n friendly staff too. I like the salad n the tacos. I will come again for the second visit.
5
Love the place and its 24*7 , food is awesome and truly mexican . Recomend to go this place and enjoy the food
4
Handy place to have Mexican food with fresh ingredient for lunch in the CBD. Nice vibes in midst of town.
4
Good food , service was fast. It’s more fast food than fine dining , price is above average for an everyday eat out
5
The food is amazing! Staff is extremely polite too :) the Baja and ultimo burrito are a must try. Will definitely come back again
4
This satisfies my cravings for mexican food, even if a little pricey. The food is warm and salsa is tasty!
5
Food served was very tasty and good portions. But what is most striking is excellent customer service. We had a very pleasant experience where the person in the counter ( probably the owner) came over and asked if everything was OK. Also he did go out of the way by providing some sample Mexican beans when we said we were finding it difficult to get in Singapore Our kids loved the place as wel
2
Ended up popping here as Hooters was closed - Ordered Steak Fajita - "Meat" was not Steak, Probably Lamb as some other reviews state as it was very watery and processed. Asked if I wanted Avocado - Sounded very nice until it arrive and there was a shrivelled quarter in my tray - 2 trays so 2 Avocados and so $2 Just WTF - Here's a pic of my sorry meal at $16.90 - Am starving now and only been back from lunch 20 min
3
Nice Mexican food. Authentic. Value for money. Free salsa. Fresh salsa. Wonderful hot sauce. Nice sour cream.
3
Burrito was a bit bland.
Tacos and rice were cold.
Overall I would recommend this place only if other restaurants in the vicinity are closed.
4
Great food, good location right in the heart of the CBD and great to hangout or for business meetings!
Cheers and keep up!
4
Been here a couple of times and the food never disappoints. I love their free flow salsa bar and their salads are super fresh!
4
Great Mexican food for reasonable price points. Free flow salsa is the best. Everything is flavorful and a single bite feels like a fiesta in your mouth!
4
Ordered the shrimp salad and it was good. Lots of shrimp, and it came with a side of chips. Plenty of salsa on the house. Atmosphere was good too: we weren't rushed at all and had a pleasant time talking and eating.
5
Loved the authentic Mexican food!! Had the best food ever. Would definitely come again!!! Thanks for the great service
3
The Thai wife and I had a quick lunch here recently. I had a spicy chicken quesadilla and the wife a spicy chicken based burrito. Both meals were fine without being outstanding. Service and cleanliness are okay in this restaurant.
5
Absolutely love this place, great food in a casual setup! I love coming here after a Long Long day. Reasonably priced too!😌
5
Baja Fresh Mexican Grill Singapore is the good place to eat Mexican food. We was looking for the place to eat at about 12:00 pm and all restaurants were closed. And then we found this place where we ate tacos and burritos!!! It's very comfortable that this restaurant open 24 hours.
3
Good location, looks nice and clean. We ordered tacos, but they were not very tasty.
It was ok, but no big deal.
5
Had a great American breakfast. Heaps of food was no need to get any extras with it. Will go back again.
4
Excellent food and wonderful customer service!!!! Especially the burritos and the quesadillas! Would totally recommend it!
5
We are regular to this place.. and there isn’t a single time we don’t walk out happy.. wonderful place, food and staff .. love it
5
My partner and i always enjoy the mexican food here as it is authentic and tasty, we highly recommend it to all our friends!
4
Free flow of salsa and mind blowing tostadas. Gives u a feel of Chipotle in Singapore.... must visit for Mexican Soul Food
5
Nice rice nice wrap and flavorful meat :) came with friends and will definitely be back again for more!
4
Staffs r nice n helpful, and most importantly, food is really nice! Must Try around SMU and CBD area!
5
Good store - best tacos and awesome churros - spend the whole night here. Beer also cold after 10:30!
5
Portions are huge, meats fresh and the sauces nice and spicy. Would recommend for Mexican cravings. Also, just found out they are open 24 hours.
5
Awesome service and yummy food . Love it and staffs are friendly . Authentic Mexican food , will come back again !
5
Excellent and cheap Mexican food. The $10 lunch sets were value for money and filled me up just like a Mexican family. Will visit again.
5
Good food I liked it a lot I ate a lot of food like chips salsa root beer quesadilla and tacos :))))
3
We paid 33 dollars for two burritos and 2 drinks with a 1for1 vouture. The food was fine but too expensive for what we got
5
I love the food a lot. Especially the quesadilla.
You should also take the fajitas and Nachos. The salsa is amazing.
5
I really like the tacos, they wete very filling, especially how they gave us a free bag of nachos. The lady on the counter was very accomodating too. Will come back again to get my dose of mexican food.
4
The ambiance is re ally nice, located in the central and it's easy to find. Food were slightly overpriced, but once in a blue moon, it's okay. The portion is actual good enough for two . Ordered the burrito and OMG, it was humongous. The set lounch which cost only $10 is really worth it. Refillable side which are very nice if you like it. Salsa and nachos are both very good combined tgt. Will go back again for sure
3
Went on a sunday night. Burrito bowl was average and not very fresh. Quesedilla was not bad but nothing much to write home about either. The food is definitely over priced for what you get. The small bag of nachos is hardly a consolation for the price. Ambience was dull. There are much cheaper far nicer mexican options in the city
5
Had lunch with work mates. This is one of my favourite Mexican joints in town. All the food is fresh and the choices of different condiments and sauces are a perfect accompaniment. Highly recommend this place. Plenty of vegetarian options too. Anant and Jaya are the perfect hosts
5
Iâ€˜ve been to Baja Fresh in California before, so I was quite happy to find them in Singapore.The food is delicious, large servings, yummy guacamole, Heineken from tap (6 bucks during Happy Hour), various other bottled beers. Definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys Mexican food!
5
Pleasantly surprised to find a Mexican Food Gem in central Singapore, will definitely come back again for more!
5
A little pricey for students but the food is delicious and it’s a nice treat to ourselves once in a while :)
4
Good, tasty food and quick service. A little overpriced but lovely location in the centre of the city near several major malls.
5
Quite a nice quesidilla with friendly staff. Great place to work late at night or for a late bite in the city. (cause 24 hours)
5
came in expecting mediocre food, but we were pleasantly surprised that the food was genuinely a delight in our mouths. will leave you satiated and content. will surely recommend to any friends or family... or even strangers!!
4
It is quite good overall, the portions are very big. Maybe, it is a bit expensive.
The service is quick and the staff is friendly. Well located near the Cathay cinemas.
4
Good and delicious
Quesadilla are soooooooo yummy
Ambiance is good and is in quite reachable location
4
Good Mexican food with a generous! Must visit if you’re a fan of Mexican! Chicken quesadillas are a must try!
3
$42 for 2 bowls inclusive of GST, but price displayed was not with GST. Charge us service fees but all they do is stand behind the counter and press buttons for us, then later bring us food. We still have to go there and order. What's the difference than going to fast food and they press for us our orders and serve us our orders. But fast food restaurants don't charge us service charge (think about that). There are restaurants out there that serve us from the front door to drinks and menu, but they don't charge us Service charge. Okay secondly, the service was not very FRIENDLY, the lady was clearly not happy with her job maybe she's tired because the shop is open 24hours? She spoke to us like as if we are dumb and everything is there why we cannot see. Like sorry pls the menu not clear to me ok. I just wanna clarify. The food portion was huge, that's the worthy part about the price. Plus There's a promo where you write a review and you get free churros. But reviews have to be shown to the counter lady. So our reviews are not anonymous because we have to show them...... This makes customers/ me feel like I don't wanna comment anything bad. So technically I'm "forced" to write a good review. I did one actually just for churros, effortlessly lol. Other than that, fast service, free water. Will probably try something else next time.... or maybe not at all..... And this is my honest real review here.
3
It looks like an authentic Mexican cafe but probably more like fast food. Everyones opinion on food is different. So the strange thing was the food did not leave an impression but the condiments did. If salsa is what you like it's an awesome place to go because it is free-flow. Price at cafe pricing and its open 24 hours. No comments on the service
4
Delicious and convenient for nights where you are craving Mexican . It is near a lot of entertainment spots and SMU
5
Great and authentic food. Their tacos are really nice, and quite affordable. Also have free churros for review 👍😂
5
This place is amazing!!! I love the food and the ambiance. The taste is the most authentic in Singapore and it is pocket friendly too. Best part is that they are open 24hrs so it’s the best place to satisfy your Mexican mid night craving!!
5
Bright colours, mismatched chairs: This place really tried to feel authentically Mexican. The corn tortillas were great, the portions were big and everything was delicious. They even have bottled Mexican sodas. It was reasonably priced too. ~S$12 for lunch.
4
Wide variety, big portion good for sharing. Reasonability priced by my standards.. Quesadillas were AWESOME.
3
The staff was polite and the food was great. Substantial and quality ingredients was used. It was a little pricy tho
5
Amazing food.. lip smacking finger licking food...love the variety of dishes available.. Would recommend this place to everyone..
5
The Mexican options are good and the food is truly delicious . Even Mexican drinks are served which is good tasty.
5
We ordered the burrito bowl. The ingredients are fresh, serving big enough for 2 to share. The free-flowing salsa bar is also amazing. Thumbs up!
5
We had buffet. Good food and service is outstanding! Convenient location.Good choice of dishes.Value for money!Will come again... and again! We are way too full after 1 round of serving!Wed to Sunday it's open 24 hours!Mon to Tues 8.30am to 10pm
4
Good food, open 24 hours, fresh food, and quite reasonable beer prices. Sad the electronic order machine is out.
5
The shredded pork burrito was good - tender, nice texture. The salsa is also really tasty! Doesnt hurt that you can help yourself to as much salsa as you like.
4
The place has a nice ambience and delicious food!! A MUST try! Good that it's 24hrs and have friendly staff to assist us whenever we need.
5
Amazing food! Value for money and will definely come back! Has their burritos and taquitos. Fresh and fast!
4
Good food, great service!
Me and my friend were super hungry so we ordered burritos. Good portion size and decent taste!
5
Fresh ingredients and great quality for a fast food chain! Our friends loved it! Endless salsa station!
5
Good Spot for a quick healthy and yummy food. we had asked for Burrito vegetarian which was very filling and tasty.
4
It’s hard to find tex-mex food in Singapore at relatively ok prices. It is very clean, the people are friendly. The salsa is fresh. Service is fast.
4
Its nice that the dish comes with guacamole and sour cream and a bag of nachos. What's more there is a bar of freshly made salsa and a drink bar for free refills.
5
With a fast food set up, ordering food here is a breeze! Had the quesadillas decked with spicy chicken and melted cheese, along with salsa and topped with guac and sour cream to complete Mexican meal experience! Everything tasted fresh and we'll seasoned!Would definitely come back here again
3
Good atmosphere and fast and efficient staff :) tried a taco for the very first time here and left feeling satisfied :)
5
Amazing place to eat with great Mexican food! My usual hang out if I feel like having good food. A must try!!
5
Best churros in town! Eating with friends at 1 AM and its totally worth it! Should try many more food here !
4
Had good Mexican food, authentic taste. Visited with wife on Sunday night. Lovely music. Will visit again for sure. Totally recommendable.
5
awesome service so far most budget meixcan food awesome choices and excellent wifi.
Fresh food. Awesome that jalapenos unlimited!
5
Open 24/7. Food is good quality. Staff is friendly! Would recommend it. Lot of drink options. The churros were also great. Good place for a quick bite
4
Great tasting Mexican food, nice place to gather with mates. Cute selection of sauces to choose from!
5
Gr8 for family and even vegeterians.
Been visiting from long time specially closer to SMU, cathay cinemas and national musium makes it easy to visit whenever we are at this part of the town
5
This place has really nice, traditional style Mexican (similar to your Zambreros, Mad Mex, Guzmen Y Gomez type places if you're from Australia). I went back twice and had the burrito and a burrito bowl, both delicious, corn chips and salsa and churros (all delicious). If you've got a craving for Mexican give this place a go. I also ordered it on deliveroo which was super convenient
4
First time here and saw came in very doubtful of what in going to have. As a big eater, I thought that the portion would not be sufficient for me. However, i only half of the burrito and abit of nachos, I already felt very full. Best part of it, every meal came with a packet of tortilla chips and there is a side bar with many choices of salsa. Overall, quite a good experience.
5
Great food with big portions! Great variety of sides available to choose from with a wide array of salsa dresssing which are very appetizing. Definitely would come back here again.
5
Amazing food
Try the borito!!!
Open 24 hours a day
Good food nice place to eat
Close to everything
Good prices of the food
Come and eat
4
Great food and nice location. Good for smu and sota students. Food is good and it's worth your money as they have big portions.
5
Good place, good food and good music. Lots of condiments given (salsa, jalapenos) at an affordable price! Will definitely revisit this place that's also open for 24/7
5
Amazing burrito bowl!! Perfect blend of taste and freshness. Great place to catch a meal during the late hours. This place serves good vegetarian options as well.
4
Prices are pretty high. Specially since everything cost at least $12. Though its pretty pricey, the amount is pretty satisfactory. But bigger plates would be appreciated!
3
We had a couple of Burritos here as we were passing, they were ok and filled a gap, importantly, the Beer was cold.
5
I have been here many times because the food is so delicious. they also have plenty of salsa and pico de Gallo for you to take. I would say the price is worth it.
4
The place is nice. Near to Dhoby Ghaut mrt. Food is tasty, big in quantity for one. Service is fast, price is reasonable
4
Good food and nice staff. Affordable place for mexican cuisine. Love it!Cheese quesadilla is a gem. Frozen margarita is also the best. I remembered my college days when I tasted it. the fro fro ice cream sandwich is a delectable delight too. Everyone who misses his/her childhood days will definitely come back for this again and again
4
Good place for students. Come between 2:30 and 5:30 for student discount of 30% off. Affordable Mexican
5
The best Mexican food I've had in Singapore. Size offerings are good for sharing as well, great value for money.
5
10/10 would eat again, super fresh food with flavours that excited my tastebuds. I feel alive again.
5
Really enjoyed the burrito bowl, recommend the surf and turf. Salsa bar has a great spread :) 24 hour opening hour also means good mexican food whenever you want it. Located right in the heart of town.
4
Food at the Baja Fresh Mexican Grill was delicious and definitely fresh! Would surely come back again another time for more.
5
Food was good, tasted very fresh. I ordered the Mexican burrito with spicy chicken. Service was good. I am satisfied with the food.
4
Extremely lively ambience! Loved the taste of the enchilada style burrito! Added bonus is that it is pocket friendly!
4
This restaurant offers great flavourful Mexican dishes like taco's, burritos and quesadillas. A friend and I both had burritos, one chicken and one steak. They were both very good. We finished with delicious churros!
1
Food is expensive ( I ordered a BB - steakhouse with brown rice) and it came like a medium portion for $24.60 inclusive of $2.09 of service charge. I felt the ordering was like Macdonalds queuing up to order but I could have collected my food myself.Cutlery and plates are all plastics.Food presentation is normal.Yet the steakhouse sounds promising but the Lady Boss serving sounds quite disappointed I did not order more.I think the service charge is excessive based on no service
5
Before having visited this place I'd been little sceptical about Mexican cuisine. However, due to the fact that my friend is really into this kind of food we eventually went there and I must admit that I absolutely don't regret doing so. We had such a wonderful ensalada that I can highly recommend
5
You have the best food ever!!!!!😅we will definitely come here again!!🤣my whole family loved it !! Thanks guys!!! We loved it
4
As the name suggest the food is fresh af💯and it has a taste of authenticity where no place in Singapore can provide
5
One of the most highly-regarded Mexican food restaurants in the city. So good & tasty!😋 Thanks to a hearty selection of freshly made tortas, tacos and quesadillas.
4
Ordered some fajitas which I predict would be very good.
Haters will be haters, so those who say it's tasteless have no taste.
5
The service was good and food came shortly after we've ordered. It was delicious and fresh and we absolutely enjoyed our meal. Thanks!
1
came back after a year. it was tastless. The food was way better last year... Had the ultimo burrito..
5
The burrito enchilada style is awesome! Its cheesy and lovely and the spicy chicken is really good especially churros.
1
never have i ever tasted such a tasteless mexican food. they offered free churros for writing a review on tripadvisor but after tasting their tasteless fajitas and taquito which, by the way, we didnt finish, we cant be bothered with free churros.
4
Looking for quality Mexican food near Plaza Sing in the middle of the night? Look no further. The restaurant is situation opposite SOTA. Quite hard to miss the place really. Atmosphere (music especially) is authentic. Not to mention the food. Quite affordable since there is a student discount. Must try
1
Poor service as food was close to 1 hr 20 minutes late, and 1 item was missed out from the order. Everything was stone cold when they arrive. Staff did not offer any compensation for the late delivery or the missed order. Will not recommend anyone to purchase online from Baja Fresh ever
5
Grest Mexican restaurant with Friendly service from Mr Goku. Chilling atmosphere and delicious Mexican food. I love the shrimp salad
4
Came here with my friends, had a great time with the ambience, food and drinks. Great portion sizes!
5
If you fancy some great Mexican food look no further than Baja! Check out the fish tacos here they are super fresh! I
4
The lunch set meal is a great deal, and the burritos are sizable with very large amounts of ingredients. The sets come with free nachos and salsa.
5
The staff were really nice to accommodate to my request of having less cheese on quesadilla and tried suggesting alternative when they knew my Friend couldn't take cheese. The food taste great as well! Highly recommend!
5
Mexican food at it's best. 24 hours open n fresh salad bar. Good drinks selection. Sizzling brownie is super super yummy.
4
Fresh food. Counter service. Good enchilada style burrito and fajitas. Loved the salsa bar, food selection of salsas.
5
Amazing food and very nice service. We especially loved the quesadillas and tacos as they were very cheesy.
5
The service was great super efficient and friendly we ordered a large nachos and large frajita and it fed 3 of us. The food was exception. Will definitely come back. A little gem in Singapore!!
4
This is a place which we visited as review was pretty good. We ordered the 2-pax set meal, which consist of a grill prawn salad, two mini burritos and 2 quesadillas, complete with chips and drinks, costing about $49 Singapore dollars.The burritos were delicious, and so was the quesadillas. Dips and salsa were on a self help basis, so you can help yourself to a generous amt of salsa. Salsa was a little too wet for my liking, but was tangy and fresh, nevertheless.The premise felt a little fast food like, so it did not feel very homely or cosy, which was the only thing which we felt could have been improved. However we understand it is a matter of deco and taste.Service was friendly and prompt.All in all, nice food, decent and clean place, and a casual dining experience
4
Good for lunch, standard of food great, price of drinks exorbitant. Buy a beer at a superette , about 400% mark up on drinks at this establishment
4
Came here at 2am for some after drinks snacks. Got the spicy chicken quesadilla, perfect to go with or even after drinks.
5
Great value for money 👍🏻
We got free burrito from our Loyalty card for today's visit. We always loved the free flow of Pico de gallo salsa and their quesadillas is my daughters favorite.
Definitely coming back :)
4
Free-flow salsa was very fresh and tasty. Food was slightly pricy though. We ordered a burrito with chicken, it was ok!
4
A nice place to get lunch and good vegetarian options. For every meal you get free chips and dipping sauces. We had ultimo burrito and taquitos which was very good 😊
4
We were staying at the Rendezvous Hotel next door and didn't want to venture too far because of the weather. Nice food, quick and easy - very helpful staff.
3
This is a nice place to enjoy mexican food. Restaurant is near a bus stop and mrt station and open 24/7 with friendly staff
5
they have an extensive menu and the service was really good. the food was served very quickly and they have student discounts which is great for students like me who are eating on a budget (-:
4
Great place to eat Mexican. Authentic fajitas tacos burritos nachos etc. 24/7 open is convinient. Overal great place!
3
We found this restaurant quite expensive as we ordered a two nachos and a (1) burrito with a water and two alcoholic beverages one of which was their happy hour special and got S$16 change from S$100. The burrito was covered in an overpowering sauce which was needed because the meal was absent in flavor otherwise. When another drink was ordered the serving staff could not explain why an S$11.95 drink advertised was going to cost S$14.95. add GST and service charge and the drink still would not cost that much.The Sour cream was served sparingly, a tbl spoon full at best and when we asked for more , we were charged S$2.10 for another tbl spoon full. We love Mexican food and eat it regularly in Australia so this meal was very disappointing
4
Great burritos and 3 cheers to the unlimited salsa. In love with the red garlicky sauce and the salsa. You can combine your meal with a drink by just adding 2.25$ for free flow of soft drinks.
4
The food was decent for the price, and the staff were extremely warm and friendly. It's good, but the food could definitely be a bit more flavourful. So my friend wants free Churros for a review.
Thanks.
5
Excellent food and cozy place. Worth the money 😊This is the third time we are vising this place and the burrito is a must try😊
4
A healthier (and no less tasty) alternative to cafe food priced similarly to this restaurant. Good for supper since the Rendezvous Hotel outlet is 24h. Will come back for more flavourful items on the menu!
5
Loved the Mexican grub there! Though it's a little pricey, you can treat yourself to a free-flow salad bar!
4
Food was tasty and service was great. We were greeted with a warm smile upon entering the restaurant. Will definitely head back to Baja Fresh again!
4
Good food, better service. Quesadillas were good and the pico de gallo and spicy chili salsa was refreshing.
4
Nice place and delicious Mexican food. Fajitas chicken with brown rice is my favourite dish. Come on happy hours, you can order this lovely Margarita drink with 50% on 2nd drink.
5
Healthy food and convenient place. We had the fajitas and tacos. Both were fresh and delicious. Will come back again
1
Not withholding the fact that the place is filthy (tables grimy, utensils oily, high chairs dusty), I was appalled to find out that "steak" in the menu is actually lamb. "But we serve lamb steak" is a lame attempt to mislead customers as far as I am concerned because it is not stated anywhere in the menu that it is not beef that is served
5
Excellent food! I had the burrito which was very yummy with the rice, guacamole and pull pork! The chips was not bad as well!
5
Lovely place to have lunch with family. Fresh salad, great ambience. Price is reasonable and very easily accessible by bus.Would visit again!
5
Wonderful experience at baja fresh, Great taste.. and loads of salsa sides options which add more flavor to your mexican meal.
Very nice place... highly recommended!
5
Awesome food and nice atmosphere :) Service staff was friendly and kind, and food was delivered promptly.
5
The food is good and the staff is very friendly! Highly recommended!!! ;):) will definitely visit again
5
One of the best Mexican food in town.
Price reasonable and location is down Orchard road.
Wed till sun 24hours.
5
The food is fresh, delicious and filling! Will come again. You know what 100 words is way too long and tbh I'm doing this for the free churros.
5
Excellent and fresh,good environment,good food,love the spices,definitely coming back,worth the time
4
We had a great lunch at Baja Fresh with unlimited servings of tacos. The servings are rather big as we couldn't finish the request for a second round of Taco with fish.
4
Baja Fresh is Cali-Mex. I've eaten at this Bras Basah outlet many times. This visit was with a group of 12. Pros: 3 different types of tortillas to choose from; soft wheat, soft (real) corn, and crunchy corn. You can choose from 2 different type of beans: pinto or black beans. The salsa bar & choices are excellent! Cons: Be aware, the Steak is not Beef! It is Lamb. However, they do not inform the customer and it is not noted on the menu, somewhat misleading. I wish it was slightly cheaper. I had Chicken Tacos on Corn Tortillas with Black Beans. I highly recommend the Nachos Grande with Chicken
5
Amazing burritos and free flow salsa! Best Mexican restaurant in town
Highly recommend to all those out there! Big thumbs up!
5
Delicious and authentic Mexican food, have had a great lunch with family. Highly recommended, will come again! The portion is great for Sharing and service was great
4
The food is good, a bit on pricier side though. The frozen margarita is nice, would recommend it. It is right in the middle of singapore, near Dhoby Ghaut MRT, so easy to find.
5
The food is amazing and it is a perfect place to have any meal at any time. The serving size is big. It is great for any trip
4
Pricey but decent food. Free churros for review too ;) Wouldn't go over and over but decent for once in a while.
5
good service, nice food. strategic location, convenient place, and they have fast wifi! :) most importantly they have really good tacos and churros.
4
Good service and very convenient place!! And it opens 24 hours by means its really good for studentt!💕
4
Visited on a Saturday. It was just us but we had a good time over food and few beers. Kok was very helpful and kept smiling while he served. Quite jovial.
5
Atmosphere is really nice and chill. Good food and to top it of their Pico De Gallo is always fresh and on point. I had the Burrito Pork Carnitas and it was delicious. Loaded with Pork and Pico De Gallo. The staff in the register was really friendly too. Salsa Bar was clean and presentable. Will definitely return to dine or lunch here. Keep up the great work Baja!!!Cheers, To
4
Thank god for Baja Fresh for their affordable burritos. After my last 2 burrito places closed I roamed the streets endlessly, wrapping random bits of meat in flat breads only to be tragically devastated.With Baja Fresh, no 8-year old ever has to worry about a random bearded man stealing the chicken from his chicken rice just to wrap it in a prata ever again
5
Great tasting burritos. The employee made sure that our order was exactly as we wanted it. He even changed one of our burritos when we didn't like one of the ingredients. And it is great that they are open 24 hours starting from Wednesdays!
4
As a Texan, I can say this is an OK restaurant. Living in Asia, I can say this is a great Mexican resto, with authentic Mexican drinks to boot!
5
it's 24 hours from Wed-Sun & the ambience is great! just walked past & came in because it looks really good, & will definitely come back again!
5
The food is great. Especially, quesadilla which is my Favourite. Baja Fresh is a nice place for a meal with family / friends.
Good taste. Now that it's open for 24 hours, we are more happy about it.
5
The food here is really good. I ordered fajitas and I was really satisfied with it. Tasteful, delicious and yummy. Probably the best mexican food in Singapore!
5
Nice quesdillas and fajita, flavourful along with sour cream and guacamole . Child friendly with kids chairs. Food delivered fast and warm.

Cycled past here around 3am and decided to try it. Ordered the spicy chicken burrito and it tastes great. Loved the pepper pico de gallo. Service was great, staff was very friendly and gave good recommendations. Will definitely come back for more.
5
Came to Baja Fresh at around 3A.M. Burrito was very tasty, ingredients were well rounded. Service was also really good! Very friendly staff. Reccommend everyone to come experience this gooood food! :)
5
Wow! Nachos were amazing and the selection of beers was nice. The carnitas was excellent. For those who know the difference between California Mexican and Tex-Mex this is more California Mexican. Only downside was the price. We spend $70 USD for a family of 5. Wouldn't go more than once but if you have been out of the States for awhile it may just be worth it to you!

My boyfriend and I visited Baja Mexican grill when we were visiting the national museum of Singapore. We did not want to be limited to the food within the museum which we felt was very over priced. So a quick look on trip advisor and a short walk and we made it to the Mexican grill.The food was really good. We both had a chicken burrito on the 9.99 lunch deal. Great value considering how expensive things can be in Singapore. The reason the review isn't 5* is as follows; the staff failed to let us know that it was a help yourself system with condiments. So when we were handed our tortilla chips we did not have them with salsa as advertised and that was disappointing. The signage within the restaurant therefore could be updated to make this more apparent for those who have not visited before. We also felt disappointed that our burrito didn't come with sour cream & salsa as we were led to believe it would be accompanied with it.We both ordered churros to finish as we were still quite peckish and this kept us full until our later evening meal. Would recommend for Mexican lovers!

GET THE ULTIMO ENCHILADA STYLE. AMAZING FOOD. slightly expensive. BUT EXTREMELY WORTH IT! Great location also. Very central. Great for an afternoon bite.
5
They were super attentive to us and were alert to our requests !!! I highly recommend this place, good portion and affordable !!
4
Ordered the Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad and the portion was huge. It is sufficient for 2 person to share and it tasted good as well.
5
Vegetarian friendly restaurant. The burrito style enchiladas are the best ever. Worth visiting anytime.
5
Good food, very nice service ! Came here at 2:30 am and found its open all night, will be coming back :)
4
Service is prompt and the food is good. The salsa can be spicier. We tried the quesadillas and taquitos and were amazed by the guacamole and rice.
4
Big portion, yummy! Authentic Mexican food. Highly recommend the spicy chicken burrito. Student all day discount too!
5
This restaurant has great service, good prices and is a great place to eat! They always have really good promotions too!
5
i didn't get the guy's name when I visited. he was the one who made the whole experience a very pleasant one :)I went in with no expectations and left feeling extremely impressed by the service that was rendered to us. he made good recommendations and made sure that we were satisfied with the food. he kept checking on us to ensure that everything was good. the tacos (take the flour choice!!!) came out fluffy and the meat was good. churros were piping hot when it was brought out to us. will definitely return agn
4
The food portions are quite good and prices are reasonable. The setup of the restaurant is like a fast food joint. We tried Chicken Ultimo Burrito (requested no rice, thank god we did as the portion was huge), Chicken Tacos (single), Veg Tacos (Meal with rice) and Veg Quesadilla. To top it all we drank Sol beer. They provided a portion of corn chips with each meal. Well worth a try
5
Awesomesauce!! Great salsa for the masses. The pork fajitas were awesomesauce!! Thumbs up from my girlfriend and my friend and his girlfriend. Enjoy!
5
We had a great time! Food is great and service is excellent.The service crew was friendly & accommodating. Must try Mexican resto in SG!
4
Great for Sunday afternoon chillout! Friendly staff and spacious environment. At City Centre of Singapore.
4
Great service and ambience. Friendly staff as well as big portion of food served. Great for those looking to eat your fill.
5
Good food and very friendly staff. Special thanks to Sumesh, who so kindly gave us plastic bags and 2 glasses of lime water for our friends who weren't feeling too well. The quesadillas and nachos were delicious!
1
This buffet had no concern for the environment. All the plates and cutlery were all paper and plastic. They say it include everything but they didn't include drinks and desert.They try to fill you up so you don't ask for anything else. To expensive and they don't talk all they have is a blank face
5
Mexican food at its best. I have come to this restaurant couple of times, food is great open 24hrs. Nice atmosphere with friendly staff. Drinks are free flow. Great place in singapore to have mexican food. Also have vegetarian options in every dish. Great place vegetarians too
5
There I was walking the streets of Singapore at 1am. The star filled sky hovered as the humid air from the hot and humid day filled the night.Woke up very hungry at 00:30 from sleeping 10 hours from my long almost 17 hour flight from California to Singapore.I ventured out of the hotel looking for any kind of restaurant that would be open to solve my need for nourishment.Low and behold only 4 blocks from my hotel was a Baja Mexican restaurant. My first thought was, the only restaurant open at 1am is a Mexican restaurant in Singapore and the attendants are from India giving service to an American, this has to be very interesting or very bad. Either way I was so hungry that some times bad tastes good enough to solve the deep hunger.The gentleman / manager on duty was named Sumesh from India. He was very professional, cordial, welcoming and polite.The cookâ€™s name was Amit from India. He also was very professional, cordial, welcoming and polite.So I ordered a chicken burrito hoping it was at least half way similar to any burrito in the world. To my pleasant surprise the burrito was very delicious, tasty and a nice size portion. Amit really impressed me on his ability to make such a delicious tasty burrito.Their Churros was also a nice sweet treat to eat after the fantastic burrito. I will definitely return to this restaurant at 1am next month when I return to Singapore. Address: 9 Bras Basah Rd. #01-03 Rendezvous Hotel, Singapore 189559. Phone +65 63377300. Jef

Ordered Set Meal for 2 which is totally worth it!!!The shrimp dish which is mixed with vege n tomato(a lit like Salah) is totally nice!! I do not know what sauce they use but when u mix it with the grilled shrimp n vege n tomato and put it in your mouth... the taste just flows in!!! Definitely recommend this dish.The other dish is a pork dish (I dunno the name of the dish) which is also Super nice! The pork is not so dry and not so wet that it drips when you bite it so it kind of just nice!!! Portion a little small though so it's like not enough after you taste it.The last of the set is the chicken burrito which is just normal. A bit dry for me but portion is just nice.Overall good here is worth the money in my opinion :
5
So here i was craving a burrito, and just round the corner from my hotel was Baja Fresh! Amazing burritos, good nachos too! The chicken is really tasty! So here i was eating away at my burrito while my mate sat opposite with tacos. I was charging my phone on the table with a portable charger, and my phone in my pocket... i then decided i wanted extra pico de gallo, so i stand up and head over to the stand, and then SMASH. I turn round and all the food from our table was spread across the floor! My charger had been yanked from my phone in my pocket, and the cable launched everything off the table in all directions!Staff were obviously VERY quick to attend, but the owner insisted we sat down had fresh food for free! I was shocked but extremely grateful as mexican food here isnt exactly cheap! Overall:Excellent service, top notch burritos, cheesy nachos, and a free burrito if you throw it on the floor!You're welcome.(Jokes, dont do that, its not worth the embarrassment.)
4
A filling and hearty Mexican meal at a convenient location just beside bras brasah mrt and 24/7! Tried the burrito and fajita.
4
Great food, healthy, there is a wide range of choice and you can even get free salsa at a counter ! And chips are included with set meals!
4
Nice place where you can have a good burrito. Good service, the guy at the cashier was very patient.
5
Great food, great staff and service. Location and venue is also very good, and it is perfect to combine with a visit to national museum of Singapore.
5
Amazing food, excellent service and filling portions. Great condiments bar and nice ambience. As selfdeclared food expert I can say that the food is definitely above average and simply amazing for this price!!
5
Excellent delicious Mexican food! Best way for Saturday wake up brunch after couple hours of aikido training
5
a great alternative for mexican food in singapore without busting your wallet, lots of options and prepared fresh considering it's a fast food chain. located conveniently in the heart of the city just next to dhobby ghaut station. definitely worth a try!
5
The service was wonderful and the food was savoury and delicious. There was a wide variety of meals available too, even for vegan and gluten-free consumers. My friends and I had a great time, I will no doubt come again!
3
Food was not bad and the location is good within walking distance to Dhoby Ghaut mrt and many major bus routes like 7, 14 etc. However it's a bit pricey but probably due to the fact that Mexican food is not cheap in singapore. Wanted to try the nachos as a side but the cheapest order was around $8 or $10 for that. Ordered a 3-taco set to share for 2 instead. And churros as dessert. The side bar for salsa Dip was delicious with unlimited refill as they are great as appetisers as well
4
If you are looking for a break from Asian food while in Singapore, Baja Fresh Mexican Grill is your spot. Try the chicken taquitos which are well seasoned and crunchy. The guacamole is surprisingly good as well as are the margaritas. The restaurant is usually crowded so don't be surprised if you have to look for a table when you arrive
4
At first glance feels like a fat for restaurant but serves write Tasty food and nibs choice of tacos, quesadillas, burritos etc
Will come back when craving Mexican food :)
4
My partner and I shared a fajitas (grande). It was served with a generous amount of pork. Very yummy as well.
Thank you for the hearty meal, baja fresh!
4
Awesome food, loved the burrito bowl! Goood representation of Mexican food. Will definitely come again !
4
Baja fresh is a great place to enjoy authentic mexican food. Although it is pricey I still enjoyed the selection of food available
5
love this place! Second time and I love the food! Huge servings with free flow fresh salsa.. Would come back here again.. :D
4
The fajitas are great but the burritos aren't the best If you do try it I would advise against adding enchilada sauce.
3
Quick service and good food. Love the salsa they give at the restaurant. Had a great time!!! Good place.
3
Good location and ambience. We had chicken tacos and nachos. Chicken was very soft and good. The sauces were spicy as we wanted. Quantity and salsa could be better.
5
Quesadillas had good breast chicken. The salsa bar is tasty. Good fast food. Meal included tortilla chips, sour cream and guacamole. All fresh and tasty.
5
The service staff was nice to tend to a group of us (7 people) and helped us to arrange our tables and even offered to help us take our table orders. The food was great, good use of Mexican spices that were both tantalising on the tongue and filling on the stomach.
5
We got our food very fast and it's sooo tasty! Here is nothing like this so I really can recommend this restaurant for guys who love mexican food !!
4
Reasonably priced mexican food in Singapore. Really enjoyed my first visit so invited my husband to dine here. Prices have gone up a little but the food is still good. I really enjoy the salsa bar.
1
1. The food was really sucks
2. They charged for service tax but no service was provided.
3. Not worth paying the price for this kind of food
4
Really good cheesy quesadillas that will keep you coming back for more:) plus a v generous student discount during nonpeak hours!
3
Counter service was fast though only 1 counter was opened. Food is flavourful though portion not big.
5
We were hungry and we want to find çorap good food. That is the place for that. The person who we order our meal WAS so kind person. He help us so much thank you very much.
1
They give you free churros for positive reviews on tripadvisor. Dont trust other 5 star reviews. Food is expensive, served cold with little meat and lot of lettuce. Place is dirty and service slow.
3
I had the spicy Chicken quesadilla and some tacos and burritos. Their dips and guacamole was delicious. It was not the best Mexican food I had but It was good enough that I would come back for a second visit if I am in Singapore.Hint : there is a 24 hour Starbucks across the roa
2
The restaurant had a few promotions going on: 1 for 1 main for that day. On the reason we were a lot, they did not give us the complementary chips. Furthermore, another promotion was offered, but was restricted to only 3 persons in our group on the same pretext that we were a lot. Doing promotions in order to get new customers is only a good strategy if you follow through and play the game fully. If you cannot, then specify it, but don't be dishonest at the last minute.On the other hand, the burritos were simple but decent tasting, however, they are far from being worth their usual 16 SGD price
4
We received an offer sent via email (buy 1 get 1 free) so my colleagues wanted to try.I took the Baja Burrito.It was really good, the quality is excellent.However, if you don't have any voucher or if they don't run any offer, it's actually expensive.12,95$ without GS
4
The taste is amazing ! Very Fresh ! A good way to get a bit of a Mexican vibe in Singapore ! It is a bit expensive though for a burrito like around 15$
5
Amazing place..Good food.. nice decor.. good location..Loved the burritos.. nice and crispy.. guacamole is amazing... Nice jarrito.. thank you for amazing service..
5
Very nice place to eat Mexican food in Singapore! Very good burritos, churros, nachos and tacos. I ll go again
5
It's our fav in sg! Authentic as in the USA. We love the quesadilla and burritos here. They offer free salsa and chips come along with the dish!
4
As a Singaporean,we love our large Portions so this place really delivers. Had the taquitos,best decision ever.
4
Food and ambience is great. My bf is the quantity eater and I'm the quality eater. Baja satisfies both.
Great food! Clean place. Friendly staff :)
5
Great food at a great price. Affordable and tasty. Had the burrito with the chewy pork. Awesome! Had taco with shrimp.
5
Came in for a quick snack in the morning . The food was made fresh and was ready in no time. Had the cheese quesadillas.
Came with complementary nachos and salsa
5
Great food at reasonable prices in Singapore. Service is fast and efficient.
We found this place around a year ago and have been back at least once a month for a good burrito.
Well recommended. A+
4
Ever since my first visit back in 2015, I've returned to Baja Fresh consistently for its tasty Mexican food. Their quesadillas are one of the best I've ever tried and I love their salsa counter that offers unlimited toppings! It would be even nicer if more guacamole were given though :)
4
The place is nice and cute. Service is good and food is delicious and filling. Perfect for students.
5
Nice ambience and great food..was served quite fast. Clean place. Good service with Mexican music. Reasonable location.
5
True Mexican. The fajitas are very fun to make and taste delicious. Very fast service, but I wish the portions could be a bit bigger.
5
It has guacamole!! A little pricey, but great food and so fresh. Accessible location and salsa has great flavor and nice for a day by the bay
5
Really amazing food, it was fresh. Very good food for a very cheap price. Definitely coming here again.
3
It was nice, good music and loved the free chips. I also like the salad bar that they offer with good salsa sauce.
5
Love the Quesadillas and the melted cheese inside! Not to forget the tacos that got oozed by the cheese and adding tomatoes makes it even healthier!
4
Really yummy and big portions! Best fajitas I've had for a while! Had to wait a while for the food considering it's a fast food place but it was worth it!
5
The food is fresh and great tasting. The location is very convenient which is a minute walk from Bras Brasah MRT. The quesadilla steak is the winner for me!
4
Its a weird thing arriving in Singapore late and finding the only obvious eating joint within collapsing distance is Mexican! However it was a good decision. This is a great little Mexican (not even mexican-style) restaurant build into the Rendezvous Hotel commercial patio. Food is great and very mexican. The proprietor and staff are attentive and friendly and in our case the proprietor could see our exhaustion and took over providing foodand drink in more than adequate proportions. We went back twice, so it must have been good. I'm pretty certain from the advertising that they do breakfast too, but we left too early to try it. Food was not cheap by some standards but quality was pretty good. The churro's dipped in chocolate with coffee after dinner were great.Bajah is Recommende
4
A fast food restaurant ambience. Went in de weekend and its pretty nice! . Portion was quite big and there's 5 choice of sauce
4
A great place to chill at midnight. The quesa here is definitely a must try; as well as the crunchy churros!
3
Convenient location nearby Dhoby Ghaut Mrt station, on the ground floor of Rendez-Vous hotel. Free flow of fresh salsa that I love! Student deal available. Family friendly.
4
Love this joint! Food is good and fresh. From quesadilla to burrito, bowls or churros - all taste great!!!
Margaritas too... well when not on working days!
4
The nachos were amazing! The food was tasty and the service was good but it's slightly pricey
Plus it's a 24-hour outlet which is pretty great. Overall, good experience.
4
Definitely worth a visit, especially if you're around during weekday lunch times (lunch sets are 9.90!). Do try the pork carnitas, the burrito and the taco!
5
Excellent place to be with friends of you are a Mexican lover. Do not forget to try tacos which was the best among all.
5
Tried the Baja burrito and loved it. Was filled with a lot of meat and salsa👍🏻👍🏻 the nachos were also excellent
4
Food was pretty good, ordered the chicken quesidellas, which I loved that it was cheesy and had a generous dollop of sour cream. Salsa was yummy too!
4
I used to go to Baja Fresh in Florida and I love it! Amazing Mexican food! Very convenient in Singapore.
5
Baja Fresh is really good and I suggest to anybody looking for authentic Mexican food and an easy going environment. I wrote this for the free churro.
4
I had a superb chicken burrito enchilada style which is worth every penny and super tasty 👌the place is very spacious and lovely for nice dinner
5
Love the Burrito! Like how you can have a choice of chicken or spicy chicken or pork! There's an assortment of salsa sauces, a good place to chill and relax after school or work :)
5
I came here with my friends and we thoroughly enjoyed the glucamole and taco and the sauce is great as well.
3
Great tacos!! Tasty and great salsa bar! Nice ambience. Great location!!!!!!!!!!! They were yummy! I'll be back!!
5
We love visiting Baja fresh whenever we're in Singapore. Awesome food and quick service. We also love the salsa bar. Definitely good for a quick bite.
5
Had an awesome set of tacos and the mrs got a lovely burrito, also offer a great salsa buffet to go with your chips, left very full!
5
Delicious Mexican food at affordable prices! Good for sharing with its generous portions too. Will definitely recommend kt to friends.
5
Highly recommended. Free nachos and salsa for the set lunch! Excellent deal and burritos are large, very filling
2
I have had unpleasant experience with the fajita plate I orderedThe meat was not skirt steakit was not marinated in Mexican spice and was not charcoal grilled the way fajita steak is prepared It tasted more like pressed and formed cubes with bland taste The guacamole was not fresh and it was too runny, but it tasted goodThe corn tortillas were not fres
5
Amazing fajita. Would recommend. Best Mexican in Singapore. Happy hor for beers. Friendly staff and good clientele
5
First try at Mexican food and was not sure what to order. Cashier gave great recommendations......food was very good. Best part.....quiet place with no hassle of weekend crowd....will come again.
4
Great awesome food. Chicken breast was juicy and tender . Great wide of spread for the whole family.
5
I love the atmosphere where it's pretty quiet and relaxing. Most of all loving the fact that there's free flow of salsa available. Shall come back again definitely!
5
Good good afforable the best is the tacos with crispy skin and the fajitas. Free flow of salsa and parsley.
2
Free churros with review. No sink to wash hands there was a toilet on 2nd level in the mall. Top tip: you can use your own drinking water to wash hands. Food was okay.
5
Consistently good food and good service! Usually here for their Tostada and Ultimo burrito, Enchilado style.
5
Happy hour pint of beer was great and perfectly paired with chips that came with free salsa in 3 different flavours. Could really taste the freshness of the salsa; highly recommend! 😀
5
I sinked my teeth into the juicy quesadilla filled with spicy chicken and pork carnitas And felt the variety of flavor exploding in my mouth. It was the perfect mix of cheese and meat with vegetables and spices coming together in unison. Every bite was heavenly. Service was excellent and food was delicious! Churros were yummy!
5
This outlet is very centrally located at Bras Basah and a walking distance from Dhoby Ghat MRT and SMU.A nice selection of authentic tasting fresh mexican food at a reasonable price. and you are sure to get a pack of free nachos with every meal that you order. 4 varities of free flow of salsa and dip in to and tantalize your taste buds.So dont miss out from visiting this outlet at the earliest.. i am sure you all will love i
4
Perfect for a date , when you are low on budget ....and want to spice up things or maybe get cheeessyyy
4
Recommending chicken fajitas! Yummy margaritas too! Good for group dinner/drinks and family gathering too!
4
decent mexican food, really convenient location, clean and comfortable, pleasant staff and good service!
4
The burrito in enchilada style is basically a huge burrito baked with cheese. Had it twice before and it's definitely delicious and filling.
5
My wife and I love this place for Mexican food. The food is fresh and nicely done. Love the variety of salsa options. Definitely worth a visit.
4
So yummy! My friends and I love it! Wow wow wow the churros are quite the mind blowing food here because it's so good!
5
first time eating Mexican food and it was niceeee. huge portion,free flow salsa, and cilantro 😍 free wifi somemore. what else can u ask for 😂
5
I've been to many Baja Fresh's back home in America and this was just the same. It was great to eat some food from home and the service was very quick. A little more expensive than usual but not too bad. Very good!
4
The food is good and they have a separate section for sides like your salsa dip (four varieties or so).
5
Didnt expect this mexican food to be this good but wow.. cat got my tongue! Had their quesadillas and the spicy chicken burrito, will certainly be back for their mahi mahi..
5
The food is good and they have a healthy selection too for the health conscious ones, must try! Very good.
5
Is a very good place to eat after
you were walking a lot in the city. The food was a lot, very delicious food.
5
The place is nice and quite, the food tastes delicious and the amount is enough for a hungry person, 100% recommended
3
Food was not bad, and seems quite authentic burritos. The portion is reasonable, but price can be lower.
4
Walked past the corner shop and waltz in as I was feeling peckish. Tried the Regular Chicken Quesadilla and loved the sides, especially the guacamole. Reasonable price for sharing, through the regular size is probably enough for one only. Great Mexican chill out place. ^.^
5
I love the burritos and quesadillas here! The salsa selection is amazing and fresh too, and what's not to love about free flow salsa! Nice ambience and service, highly recommend!
4
Big choice of menu items. Quite a number of offerings for a small but cozy joint. Unlimited serving at the salsa bar, ranging from mild to hot. Service was pretty quick and efficient despite the crowd.
5
We stop by here every time we are in town! Great food, great service, never disappointed! We love all the food including quesadillas, chimichanga, etc. Highchairs for kids too.
1
One of the worst Mexican take outs I ever had! The food was ice cold as if pulled out of the fridge and chicken tasted as it had been freezed for a few days Moreover I found staff to be unpleasant and dismissive ( felt as though they could wait to finish their shift ) I would avoid here at all costs even though it presents ok!
4
Ordered spicy chicken quesadilla and fish taco. They give a free bag of chips too which is a nice touch. The quaesedilla came with various sauces/toppings by the side so that you can choose which ones you want to add. Recommend getting the larger size, as the smaller size is a bit small (maybe good for small eaters)
4
One of the best tacos in Singapore
Small place and always full of guests.. the location is just next to Dhoby Ghat MRT
4
Big food at good prices. Big burrito was very good. Comes with free salsa and crisps. Fajitas looked good.
5
This is my second time and bringing new friends! I love this place!
The buffet deal is worth it! You will definitely enjoy!!
4
Veggies can have stomach full of tasty food at this place with a lot of options. The staff is quick and quite helpful.
4
My husband and I love the food here most esp the salad and quesadilla. This is our second visit and now trying the Mexican Buffet! Worth your money...😊
5
Went to Baja Fresh for lunch. Was really fast service and food was great! Was a really relaxed atmosphere like a fast food chain. Reservations can be made through Chope if required.
Tostada salad was v good.
3
Yummy food and price was alright esp for the good portion!! Would recommend this place for sure! Try the nachos! And a nice cold beer to go along, Looks like a fast food but cozier!
4
Huge serving and very tasty! They serve fresh and hot. A lot of choices for salsa. Good place and nice ambiance.
3
Food tasted great and was very pleased with the service they provided, would recommend to anyone in the area!
4
Looking for a place for Mexican food and found this place on Trip Advisor. Not as expensive as some Mexican restaurants but not necessarily low budget either. The food was different but very tasty. We enjoyed the bowl with chicken, brown rice, various veggies and avocado garnish. We also enjoyed the soft taco with pork. My friend liked the Mexican Lime soda. I will eat there again!
5
So fresh so good! Would definitely come back again for the food. The free flow of tostitos was very awesome!
5
All times favourite nachos! Love the guacamole! Been here for many years... Taste authentic! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
5
The staff is extremely nice, and the food is good too. Very close to SMU, so a perfect spot to come between classes. They also have drink specials to take advantage of!
5
Great lunch at Baja Fresh! Recommended to all wherever you're in the vicinity. The burritos and tacos taste delicious! :)
5
Located centrally in Singapore, Baja Fresh offers great Mexican food. They have several vegetarian options as well. Service is prompt and overall experience is good. Definitely a must recommend.
5
Fresh ingredients, good food @ great value and portions. Great beer and margaritas on tap too! Baja is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Singapore.
5
Surprisingly great food and freshest of ingredients. Not too pricy. We ordered quesadilla and taco and it was sufficient for 2 people. Will come back for sure.
5
Unique version of the guacamole which went really well with the ensalada! Amazing food and drinks + good burritos and qaesadilas!
2
Weirdest tacos I've ever had (in a not so nice way)The steak taco leaked a lot of "juice"(?)Overall quite bland & the cheese used feels dry & completely tasteless...Maybe it was just not what we expected and what we're used to!Nice to see that they do serve alcoholic beverages though
4
Ive always passed by this restaurant when staying at Rendevouz hotel but never went in and try. I bought the steak tacos and chicken quesadillas. And they were surprisingly good. Next time will try to dine in, as you can top up the salsas as many times as you want.
3
The food was quite good quality and decent size but seems expensive for Singapore. There is a better food court around the corner
4
We ordered the lunch set quesadillas, tacos and bowls to share. Portion is generous. The shrimp quesadilla was our favourite - so we ordered another. Good spacious place and staff!
3
Been to the rendavous hotel outlet. The outlet was more like a fast food branch then a Resturant. The happy hour beer was too diluted and SUSPECTED to be mixed with soda water. The food was good overall despite the outlet ambience.
5
10/10 cool chill place to get together with the bros. The burrito and quesadilla are really nice and should try. Also free churros!
4
After an order is placed, the food comes quickly. Decent simple Mexican food. Salsa counter has extra jalapenos and different heat level of salsa's. Priced mid range as well
5
Very wide selection. I like the salsa bar concept because I like my tacos spicy! I've tried the burritos, tacos, nachos, guac, cocktails. Good stuff!
5
Everytime we visit Baja Fresh, we always enjoy the foods. #cravingsatisfied😄
All are freshly made👍
Taquito are very crunchy,nice combination with the guacamole🤗
4
Really fast delivery of food but again great and tasty food.. Free salsa that you can take as much as you want is a great extra. And have student discount! Worth going too
5
Unlimited drinks , alfresco or inside setting , free chips with salsa , pico de gallo , yummy burrito and tacos ! Right in the heart of the city, highly recommended !
Burrito bowl is a bit bland though!
Try quessadila and churros!
4
We were exhausted and hungry from a long flight so we decided to give this chain Mexican restaurant near our hotel a try. The food was not authentic Mexican but it was quick, inexpensive, and fresh.
3
The food was good! Fresh and tasty! The ambience is nice and cozy, a perfect place for friends to hang out. Will definitely come back again
2
With plenty of good Mexican options around, it's unlikely that I would return. Food was disappointing.
4
We found the food very good (even though the quantities are not very big) and it came very fast. The waiters were Very friendly.
4
Despite the deceiving ambience of a fast food joint, Baja Fresh serves Mexican Food fit for a king :) Portions are also very large.
4
Love the free flow Salsa Baja, friendly service and fresh food. Upgrade to mahi mahi when you order your meal! And free churros too :)
4
Yummy Mexican to go! Patient n friendly staff
Food was hearty and well priced.
Looking forward to go back again .
Thumbs up
5
Fantastic place for mexican food. Affordable and good food. Near to the mrt, convenient to get there. Not too crowded
3
I was craving for mexican food and just nice I walked pass this restaurant. Great location and mediocre service. But I found the food is not so impressive, I suggest that they need to consider offering more spicy food and wider variety. However, the quesadilla is really nice! a must try
2
Having read the great reviews on trip advisor we went in for our first Singapore meal - we ordered a burrito and a quesadilla and both had a weird after taste. All the dips were good, staff extremely helpful. Given the dearth of vegetarian restaurants in the vicinity perhaps a must go for some, but I would not repeat

This is our second time at Baja Fresh. The first time we came was because we bought a buffet Groupon. The layout of the place isn't much to shout about; it looks like a Subway outlet. But don't let its looks fool you! We sampled their quesadilla, tacos, mini burritos and fajita and it was great! So today we decided to come back for more. We got their promotional surf n turf and a spicy chicken quesadilla. Both tasted amazing! The flavor is great and the portion not too impeding. There is also their free flow salsa bar and free nachos per pax as a bonus. But really, if you are looking at authentic and nice, yet affordable Mexican food, come to Baja Fresh

Affordable yummy Mexican food! Considering how Singapore lacks Mexican food, glad to have this establishment around the corner from my place!
5
Found this awesome place as recommended by my friend. The food is good and the best part is that they are giving free churros if you write a review.
2
The service and food was below what I expected. The food is not authentic Mexican food - there is absolutely no cheese or sour cream included in the products. Primarily lettuce, tomatoes, beans, rice based - all low cost items to maximize profit.
4
Second visit. Had the Spicy Chicken fajita and Chicken Taquito. Much improved and closer in selection and taste to the American version. Will come back.
4
Jag besökte Baja Fresh i sedan veckan. The portions are huge and enough for two per burrito, bring extra stomach space. Free flow salsa rocks too.
1
$38 for a carne asada burrito and a beer. Insane. So many better options.
Check out Muchachos or the Mexican joints in Holland. Better prices and better food.
4
Love this Mexican chain restaurant. Good location in city center and good variety of options. Lots for vegetarians to choose from. Located in the Rendezvous Hotel.
4
Tasty and fresh Tex Mex at reasonable prices. Free flow of fresh salsa to layer on top of your meal for the added tartness. The myriad of flavours provided the perfect disco music for the taste buds to start dancing. 2nd alcohol beverage at only $6 all day which is perfect to bring a friend down to grab a pint.
4
I ordered tostada salad, the serving size was pretty generous. My spouse ordered the taco, it was pretty dissapointing the serving size was wayy so small. Not too mention if you prefer the taco to be crispy, they charged another $2. As he loved Mexican Food so much this was quite dissapointing for him, but for me I'm very satisfied with my order.
4
The location of this restaurant is easily accessible whether you are driving or using public transport. The Tostada salad was wonderful, with ample serving of guacamole and sour cream. Love that they have various condiments at the side to complement the meal. Love the hot serving of Mahi mahi fajita with brown rice. The only con is that the mahi mahi taste a little fishy to me. Perhaps the meats will be better. Service is fast and friendly. Although it is a little pricey, they do have groupon deals now and then which is very worth it
4
Food at baja fresh is affordable and authentic mexican. I love coming here often. Go for it for mexican food adventure here
5
We ordered tacos and quesadillas, it was fresh and mouth watering. Sides were tasty too. I love it been so conveniently located from my work place that I can enjoy it atleast once a week.
4
I loved the taste of margarita..
Amazing anbience
Yummy food , churrod , burritos, quesadillas
Simply superb
Lovely taste
4
The breakfast barritos is fresh and tastes good, also pretty good value for money. The service is good and friendly. The location is not far from orchard so its really convenient. Recommended!
5
Good ambience and food. Yummy quesadilla and tacos! Tasty churros, too. Just need to reduce the aircon,especially on a rainy day. But the food made up for it!
4
Good service, fast servings, fresh foods, easy menu, cheap drinks, non over price foods, flavourful sauces, authentic mexican
4
Really loved the tacos, filled with tremendous amount of meat and tomatoes. Loved the black beans accompanying it as well! Keep up the good work
4
Generous with fillings. Burrito was good and great student promotion! Salsa sauce was good as well!!
4
Good, fresh food. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the service was quick. Something for everyone, and good for the whole family.
2
It was half empty when we reached the restaurant. Took a while to read the menu but everything quite simple. Plenty of choices at additional cost. The food arrived shortly and it's huge with beans and rice. If you order tacos.... it's soft shell by default. You have to pay additional for hard shell tacos. Their servings are large but it's all filled with beans and rice and fresh veggies. The portions of spicy chicken in each taco and the large burritos were rather small. Pay additional $3 and $4 if you want fish and beef. I cannot even find the guacamole in the burritos even though it was mentioned in the menu. Overall, if you want to try Mexican fast food style... this is the place. Return to Eat: Nope
5
Pretty good! Came here often to eat. Love the burrito. It is authentic Mexican food with Mexican vibe. Highly recommend
5
Baja Fresh is delicious. The staff is friendly too. The burrito bowl was A LOT of food and I will have lunch leftover for tomorrow. We will be back!
4
A lot of food to eat, leaving all my friends and I very very full. The groupon portion was much bigger than expected for the price paid.
5
Great food. Nice service. Serves fresh as always. Been here several times and we just keep coming back. Totally worth it!!!
4
Good food! Free drink is worth it! Good location. Try the burritos! The beans were ok. Rice was ok. But the margarita was good!
4
The churros are really good and crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. Highly recommend coming to this place. It's in town so the location is very convenient. The furniture is very hip and comfortable.
5
I love the food here! Authentic Mexican cuisines and the portions are filling! Free flow salsa is a bonus too
5
We came here 19 of us, the staffs are very friendly and accommodating! Awesome food as well! Good job! Keep it up! Definitely will come again!
5
Awesome food and great service!! It really his the spot especially the super delicious churros! Very popular with the student population nearby and for good reason. The quality of ingredients is always of the highest and freshest. Also as a vegetarian, never short of choices. My personal favourite is the salsa ice bar with a brilliant selection of different salsas.
4
Great food that is value for money! We ordered two burritos and it was bigger than expected the bigger than the average burrito. A very good student discount which makes it more affordable for students and it comes with free corn chips. With free flow of fresh salsa, it's definitely worth visiting again, we'll be coming back to try more!
5
Baja is a good place to eat and hang out with friend. Good atmosphere and delicious food. Moreover, it has a strategic location which is near the bus stop of plaza singapura. Keep on going !
5
Excellent quesadillas and surf and turf bonfire bowl!!!!!!!!!! :) Nice experience but slow service. Nice chips and guacamole too!!
4
Baja fresh is my all time favourite for mexican food in singapore. Where else do you get mexican food at such affordable prices! The margaritas are worth a mention! And i also really like the concept of salsa bar!
4
All time Fave at Baja fresh! Gotta have the Tostada Salad!!! Crispy shell as based for a wholesome meal for 2 hungry girls!
5
Best Mexican food in Singapore!!! Be sure to drop by:) The food is really nice and they have really good service
5
We dropped by Baja fresh Mexican grill as I craved some nice Mexican food and fresh veggied. The quality of veggies and quesadilla will blow your mind. So refreshing and delicious. Give it a try if you are a big fan of Mexican food
4
Been to Baja fresh for a couple of times. Amaze by their service. If you are not sure what's for lunch or dinner, ask them. They are able to give you some recommendation.Their serving is big and taste wise, one word, delicious. They provide several type of sauce for you to go with your meal. Most importantly, free flow!Do drop by if you have the chance
5
Glad we found this place in Singapore. The food was very tasty and fresh. We loved the personalized service the hosts gave us. We visitted twice in a week. Their chicken quesadillas and cheese nachos was our favorite. The restaurant is nice and casual and reasonably priced. Their happy hour deals are amazing. We will definately come again for our next visit

Expensive. They nickel and dime you for every little thing, including a 10% service charge added to a bill that is fast food in that you order and pay at the counter. They also add the GST. Want brown rice instead of white rice - a dollar additional. Want dipping sauce with the churros - $1.50 additional. For their "Happy Hour" jug of Heineken is more expensive that what you could expect to pay for a jug of beer in an establishment that has live music. Food is average - prepared early on and placed in a warmer until you order. Not really fresh
1
I had to do some business near the area that this place is located, therefore I decided to give it a try, thinking that since it is a fast food place, I wouldn't expect the best food but an affordable price. So I entered the place, I was greeted by a nice gentleman who was very kind and started offering me different options, I took a look at the menu and decided to go for some steak tacos. The menu said something like sgd$14.95 for the plate but no meat was included plus if you put meat on them an extra charge of sgd$3.00, the person that helped me offered if I wanted brown rice without mentioning to me that this was to be charged extra. So I ordered the rice, he also offered me avocado for an extra sgd$1.00, so I ordered it. Besides the taco plate I ordered a mexican soft drink Jarrito and this was sgd$4.50. I ate my tacos and at the end I asked for the bill, thinking that it would be around sgd$25.00 or so, to my surprise I received a bill for the amount of sgd$35.00I checked it because I thought that there was some kind of error, but no, it happens that in the menu the only thing that is mentioned as extra is the meat, whether steak or chicken but the rest of the stuff is not mentioned, also this prices do not consider tax, therefore when you add everything plus the tax it actually increases a lot.If I was in the US at this same type of restaurant, I would have not paid more than US$15.00 tax included, which is the equivalent of sgd$21.00, I ended up paying the equivalent of US$25.00, come on, for this price I can eat at Olive Garden, much better food and the attention would have been much better also.It seems that the people that work here are only interested in making people consume without knowing and then at the end there is no other option but to pay.So, considering that this is a fast food stall, the quality of the food is not that great and the attention of their servers has some kind of bad intention included so you end up paying more, I would recommend to anyone considering to eat here, not to do so.You can get real mexican food and much better not only in quality and taste but also in price at places like SeÃ±or Taco or Viva Mexico restaurants.I do not recommend this place at all, you will end up paying quite a lot of money for food and service that is not worth it
2
The staff in the counter not helpful enough, rather giving a awful when you don't know what you order.
Expensive and serving portion is really small.
5
This place is such great value, the food is very fresh, happy hour also gets the thumbs up!
Tacos, buritos & wraps are very large.
5
Amazing food with just the right prices. Drinks can be refilled. Lots of variety to choose from for vegetarians.
3
This was just next to our hotel so we ate here a couple of times during our stay in Singapore. Good food, nice portions, price is average.
4
Nice little restaurant offering Mexican food. Service is quick, prices are rather steep but it's in central area catering to tourist as well as locals. Decent choices available for Vegetarians too.Food seems fresh but not fancy, taste is Okish.And yes, they provide 2 free churros if while eating you check-in to its website on facebook
2
We were looking for a tasty meal in a pleasant eating environment, and unfortunately this cafe was not as we expected. For a fast food meal, it is probably okay, but the quality of the dishes was not as we hoped for on this occasion, and the dining area is very basic.
2
We read the reviews here and thought we would give it a try. The food came out suspiciously fast and we ended up with gristly beef in the surf and turf, margaritas from a slushy machine and soggy caesar salad.Tacos were ok.Not exactly low budget either for the fast food ambience - SGD $110 for a family of 4. Disappointing
5
To people who intend to come to this place, well remember that its fuss free.So you have multiple options to choose from : Quesadillas, Burritos, Fajitas, Tacos, Nachos, Tostadas etc..They have vegetarian option in all the meals which is a plus.Other options being Chicken and some other meat.I personally love their Veggie Quesadillas and Veggie Tostada.I'm yet to try their Churros which are on my wish list.They have an option of Corn or Regular Tortillas or Black or Pinto Beans, so you can customize your order.The best part of this restaurant is the buffet of dips which is available to you. You've got 4 different types of salsa. You've got jalapeno peppers and an amazing Pico de Gallo. Its amazing
4
Thee food was fresh and very delicious. My husband especially like the fresh salsa or pico de gallo. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table after they prepare it. But when I ordered a small burrito the fellow gave me a large one and charged the large price too. So make sure he takes your order correctly
4
I love mexican food but being a vege i do encounter restaurants who serve u with dishes filled with jst sour cream, rice n some zuchini, in the name of vege version. This restaurant does justice to the vege version n the taste is good too. They have complimentary free flow of toppings which is a steal. However, the taste I feel isnt that authentic as compared to some high end restaurants that I have tried. But if ur in this part of the town n wana go for some chilled out n filling Mexican food, here is where u should land. They serve well prices beer too
3
It is not easy to find mexican food in Singapore and hence this is 1 of the choice. Price wise is okay but food could be better.
3
Kinda best veggie food in Singapore, variety of fresh salad and chilli, pastas and mexican totillas. all well prepared. chicken is not that good though
4
Love Asian food but this was a very nice alternative. Loved the choice of different salsa and chilli
4
Hard to find veggie food in singla .. is a delight to have it here - fresh salsds with a variet if dips and sauces , mexican tortillas and pastas all .Tasty and fresh !
1
Donated SGD 70.00 to the Baja Stale Foundation. This place is an over-priced fast-food chain. Steak fajitas is akin to rubber flaps, and nothing close to what the pictures suggest. It is surviving off tourists.
4
I have visited this place 4 times in the last 1 month & have consistently found their food to be of great quality and taste. I love the free corn chips and dips they provide with every plate. Also if you check in on facebook you get a plate of free churros! Who wouldn't !!The quesadillas, based burrito,tostada salad are all very tasty.Definitely recommended
5
We ended up eating here twice ( no buffet the second time !) Don't choose the buffet. .. You will be pushed to eat $24.95 worth. Delicious Mexican food and great margarita jugs. The tostado salad was great and lovely burritos, quesadillas fajitas etc etc. we visited twice as it was located right under the Sail building in marina Bay Area. Would def visit again and again
4
As we are vegetarians, we ordered nachos, quesidias, churros with extra chocolate sauce (2$) and it was all good. Pl note they give u free nacho chips and there are a few types of different sauces and salsa's on one, these you can refill as many times and are quite nice. the jalapenos are nice and spicy
2
I decided to try Baja Fresh during one of the Night Festival evenings. Just like the Baja Fresh in the U.S., there was the fresh salsa counter. However, the food here is really bad - the chicken fajitas was cold and the chicken was rubbery. Not worth the $13! Youâ€™ll be better off eating at another fast food joint round the corner
3
Staying at the hotel above the Baja I was looking for a quick meal to fill my stomach, and this hit the spot.Not great Mexican food, more like a fast food Mexican place. Everything was a little bland and lacking spices. I wouldn't go as far as saying it was bad, it did the job of filling my stomach, as would other fast food joints.You get what you pay for...
5
I love mexican food and have tried several mexican restaurant in Singapore, everything is great but Baja Fresh is our favourite.
Great location just walking distance from Plaza Singapura and affordable price.
3
We went for tacos a few times which was Good for the price we paid. The ambiance feel like a fast food style like KFC MCDONALD etc. The Serving plate was papers, foam plates and plastic fork and knife.
5
Visited with friends many times in the past year. One of the best places to eat Mexican food. Prices are reasonable and the food is delicious. It's not even so oily as in other places that claim to serve authentic Mexican dishes.
3
The food was delicious and the portion was huge. It was a lovely experience there. The place however looked more like a fast food restaurant and I expected slightly more from it. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant experience and I would go back there!
4
I like mexican food as it usually gives the feeling of freshness. In the Singapore heat - that does count!
Yes, I like this place
4
We had the burrito and simply loved the freshness of the ingredients used! Very flavourful and reasonably priced! Mexican restaurant in sg can be quite expensive so this is an economical way to satisfy my craving for authentic Mexican food..
3
When I first walked into the restaurant, it did not give me a very welcoming vibe - the place was pretty empty and no staff to be seen at the counter. Also, the ordering system was pretty confusing with different menus on the table, above the counter and on the self-service kiosk. At first, I thought it was just myself, but the 2 behind me also had troubles ordering. The management should seriously consider renovating and revamping the layout of the restaurant. The service crew can also be more cheerful and appear more welcoming as well.Whereas for the food, it was pretty okay. I like the various sauce dips that was available for self-service.
5
Have been a frequent visitor to this place with colleagues but this time decided to get the family as well. Don't need to mention about the freshness, the quality, the taste and the turnaround time after you place the order. Centrally located and easily accessible by bus, MRT with a few minutes walk.It was a vegetarian feast with veggie quesadillas, burritos, enchiladas and tostadas. The kids and elders started with the nachos and feasted on the food and subsequently the desserts.Can't wait to go back once again soon.Highly Recommen
5
I tried Baja Fresh Mexican Grill the first time last November and I have been going back ever since! My favourite dish would be their burrito! The overflowing toppings always leave a spark on my taste bud that never fails to leave me wanting more! My friends and I find it reasonably priced and we often return to the restaurant whenever we crave mexican food. I strongly recommend this place to those who have not tried mexican food before! The ambience of the restaurant is lovely and perfect for after work chill out sessions with your friends
5
My boyfriend and I loves Baja so much! Everytime we crave for Mexican food, Baja will always be the first choice. Foods are always fresh and affordable. We will never get enough of Baja. As my boyfriend says, 'we can eat this all day everyday'.
4
A lot to choose from. Whenever I crave for mexican food, Baja fresh always come to mind.
Everything is made fresh. You can make your own salsa also.
Though it's a bit expensive, I think it's worth it.
4
There are a number of choices of main dishes to choose from. The food is well presented and tasty. There is a sauce bar where you can get sauces of varying degrees of spiciness.
A fajita and a beer came to S$22
4
Baja Fresh is finally open at The Sail. This is my favourite Tex-Mex and near my workplace. The staff are nice as well as the owner. They did my Burrito perfectly and it was very fast. I loveee the guacamole too. Happy happy happy! 😊
4
Mexican Food is not easy to find in Singapore. I had never of Baja until my friend suggested that we could go there for dinner. I am glad that I know the place now. I went there with my friends and we found that the food was tasty. We had the shrimp salad, nachos, burrito, and quesadilla. I liked the salsa bar as well. One of my friends was not eating meat and was grateful that there was a vegetarian option. Don't expect cheap fast food pricing here, but the good quality might just be worth the price
4
Dined here today with my family today! Extensive Mexican dishes. Fajitas, Enchiladas, quesadillas, tacos, nachos, churros and Margarita. The best part is they have vegetarian option for every dish! I greatly appreciate that. There is a open salsa bar too with plenty of condiments to go along with your main dishes. We ordered cheese and vegetable Quesadillas which comes in two sizes, regular and large. we ordered regular which was fresh, piping hot, filled with cheese, red bell peppers and onions. Excellently done! Every meal comes with a complimentary bowl of nachos. A cheese to go along with the nachos will cost you $ 4 though. We tried their churros which was a let down. Hard and too oily and you have to purchase the chocolate sauce separately as well. Overall, it's fresh Mexican fare at a reasonable price.
5
I have this continuous craving for a Mexican Burrito for the past week. This is my go-to place, as its centrally located at Dhoby Ghaut, and the food come quick when you need food to go. I rounded up several friends and we came to Baja Fresh for dinner recently. Each of us ordered what we liked and we shared amongst our dining group. Here are the highlights:- Baja Bowl with Chicken: $10.95. Actually served in a plate, with rice, beans, grilled vegetables, onion, cilantro, cut chicken cubes and drizzled with salsa. Reminded me of a cross between a pizza and Chinese rice. The salsa topping is mildly spicy. Its nice and I will order this again.- Burrito Mexicano with Pork Carnitas: $11.95. This was what I had come for. The burrito was chockfull of ingredients: rice, beans, salsa, chopped onions, cilantro and pork carnitas. Shredded cheese was sprinkled over the burrito and toasted then laden with a brown mildly spicy sauce. Definitely good to share, cos the portion is quite big and sharing with someone else means you can eat other stuff!- Tacos Baja style with Mahi Mahi: $12.95. This was corn tortilla filled with salsa, chopped onions and cilantro with fish. Sour cream was served on the side. The ladies in my group liked the healthy dining feel for this dish.- Quesadillas with Pork Carnitas: $11.95. We ordered the regular sized quesadilla. The tortilla was filled with Monterey Jack cheese, sour cream and pulled pork. It’s pre-cut into 4 slices, so its like eating an appetiser. All of us loved this and it’s a must-order!- Quesadillas with Shrimp: $12.95. We couldn’t get enough of the pork quesadilla and ordered ordered another quesadilla with prawn instead. The prawns were grilled. I personally preferred the pork version better.- Chicken Tortilla Soup: $5.95. The soup looks like tomato soup with slices of avocado and cheese at the bottom. Its tasty and not spicy, despite the staff informing that its spicy. Tasty and a good order for days when you need something soupy to warm your tummy. Try it!- Dessert - Churros: $4.50. Freshly made, and its served nice and hot. Its coated with fine cinnamon powder and sugar. You can eat it on its own, or order chocolate sauce to dip the churros in for that chocolate-ty flavour! Must-try!For drinks, they have a wide variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages: Margaritas (Lime/ Blue), Sangria, a range of beers (Corona, Asahi, Tiger, Erdinger, Hoegaarden and Somersby Apple Cider) in addition to the usual Juices, soft drinks and hot beverages.I had the Corona Beer, Blue Magarita and Lime Magarita. The blue margarita was special cos of the blue color and the ladies in my dining group loved it. I liked the lime margarita. Overall, a great place to . Price-wise, its not expensive, compared to a sit-down restaurant. Good value-for-money. Recommended

Had lunch at the new branch next to One Raffles Quay just now. It's pretty quick turnaround for a take away, so that's good. But given the state of my supposedly hard shell taco, I wish they'd taken a few more minutes to prepare something that didn't look like it had just been pulled out of the bin.The hard shell I ordered came out as a soft shell. Basic error - even the ticket on the box stipulated it should have been hard shell. The filling was...well...unfulfilling. It was meagre, too heavy on the onion and pretty bland in taste. The presentation: a joke. The spicy chicken burrito was better but still bland, the result of too much sour cream. I could attribute all of this to teething errors in a new establishment, but this is a franchise. Absolutely zero excuse. And the taco issues are so fundamental, I have no tolerance for that type of quality control error. Unfortunately this type of chain is the only place that can afford the ridiculous rents around ORQ, so no doubt this place will, at some point, be replaced by another equally rubbish outlet. If you want a reasonable Mexican, walk the extra 5 minutes to Asia Square and go to Gomez

Baja Fresh Mexican Grill at Rendezvous Gallery serves a range of popular traditional flame-grilled Mexican specialties. There are more than 40 items on the menu, which include fajitas, quesadillas, burritos and tacos.The food was freshly prepared. It was well presented. Complimentary tortilla chips were basic but good. The ambiance is comfortable enough. The staff was exceedingly friendly. The refill of aerated drink for $1 was very good too. A good Mexican Set lunch for under $13
5
We had Baja Fresh at LA and we were very excited to find one in Singapore. We ordered the Ultimo Burrito and my wife ordered the quesadillas. The food was extremely fresh and we both felt that the quality and tastes were better than what we had in the States. They had a very large variety of beer as well with great happy hour deals.! My friends ordered the spicy chicken bare bowl. He liked it so much that he ordered another one! We are big fans of Mexican food so we tried 4 Mexican places during our visit to Singapore. We liked Baja Fresh the most and we went there twice during our 6 day visit.. The service was excellent. Oh yes - they also have free nachos and salsa! They can improve their churros :) keep up the good work!
3
Found this place while taking a leisurely stroll from our Hotel on Bencoolen St. This a mexican food joint with food being yummy and light on tummy. But the only down side is the high prices. Ordered some tortillas and tacos. They give nachos and fresh salsa dips as an accompaniment
5
This is an excellent Mexican restaurant very close to National Museum. It has good options for vegetarians like me and the food is very authentic. Service is fast and restaurant is clean.
4
Super quick service, great quantities and true to the Mexican style and cuisine...
A great range of dips and sauces available...
Very clean and well maintained property.
4
i visit here several times, because almost same as real Mexican food.i stayed MEXICO 4 years, so i know mexican food.some food they modify for asian style, but almost good.tacos, bussitos, quesadilla, fijitas and tortilla soup(sopa de tortilla).....i like.only one problem, parking is very difficult.location, food, staff.....all make me happy.can you visit there, and try? hahaha....

I had a craving for a Burrito last Friday and the craving just didn’t go away. I managed to convince my colleagues to make the trip to Baja Fresh which is located at Grand Rendezvous Hotel, at Dhoby Ghaut. They have set lunches available for $10, and you have a choice of 6 sets to choose from.We decided on 3 different sets so we could try a variety of dishes:- Burritto Mexicano: Baja rice, black pinto beans, mild salsa, fresh onions and cilantro wrapped in a flour tortilla with chicken. Loved it. The rice is tasty and helped fill my tummy.- Quesadilla: Warm grilled flour tortilla filled with jack cheese and chicken. Served with fresh guacamole, fresh pico de gallo and sour cream. Tortilla folded in half and grilled. Like eating a pizza. The guacamole and sour cream were also good and went well with the quesadilla.- Taco: 2 small flour tortilla filled with chicken, salsa and cheese. Its served ‘open-faced’ so you need to hold it up and eat it. Careful, the fillings may fall out on the opposite side when you eat it.All the above orders came with a small bowl of tortilla chips which you can eat by itself, or pick your favourite salsa from salsa bar counter. There are 2 types of hot salsa and the milder Pico De Gallo (which is chopped up tomatoes and onions in a mildly spicy tomato juice.Soft drinks are at $2.60, which you can help yourself from the drinks dispenser. They also have margheritas and beer to go with your meal.If you are craving for taco to go, this is the place to go. Try it

We called for Baja Fresh for catering. We were pleasantly surprised with the amount of food they had packed for us. The food was laid out perfectly for us with name tags and the set up was very professional. My guests loved their nachos with salsa. They were amazing!. We ordered the Shrimp Ultimo Burritos. They have customised smaller sized burritos for catering which is good as people get a chance to taste all their variety. Their spicy chicken quesadilla was also a favorite amongst our guests. The quality of their disposable plates and cutlery was quite a premium compared to other catering providers in Singapore. The food was definitely a highlight to the party :
5
Been looking for some decent tacos for awhile and found this restaurant. Read some reviews and decided to give it a try.Ordered Baja Burrito with pork carnitas, shrimps tacos, ceasar salad with chicken and churros..pay a little extra to top up our burrito to make it Enchilado style. Each main course comes with a bowl of tortilla chips. Fresh salsa is available at the counter with 4 level of spiciness. Tried all & they are good!We got regret the moment when our salad & main course come to our table. The salad is good for one person for those who is going on a diet or something. Burrito comes with more tortilla chips and the tacos comes with rice & bean. True Mexican style!!! Our order is good for 3 person at least! Lastly we did our best to finish off the churros with chocolate sauce, not too sweet, just the way it should be!Though the crowd is kind of slow on a weekday despite lunch hour. But this place is a must go if you are looking for fresh Mexican food!Everything is so fresh here and definitely will come back again. Probably will come at night so can have some margaritas too. Next time will bring more people but order lesser food so we can finish everything
5
We knew that Baja Fresh is a family restaurant and hence we took our 1 year old baby boy with us. The place is very kid friendly. They provided us with a comfortable baby chair. The food was great. I like their bonfire bowls the most. We generally get guacamole for my baby as it is fresh and healthy. My wife likes their enchilada style burrito. This has become our weekly family outing. Keep up the good work!
5
Me and my wife had an early dinner at Baja Fresh. I was excited to see their great deals on beers and margaritas.. My wife loved the crispy tacos and I liked their bare bowls (Mexican rice with beans and salsa and sour cream.. Yum!) The place is refreshingly casual and unpretentious.. Very different than other uptight places in Singapore .. Perfect place to chill out .. We will come here again with friends
5
we visitted this place thrice in our 4 day visit to singapore. .. the service at this place is excellent - much better than the poor service we got else where in the city we ordered their burritos - it was huge and filling and had a perfect combination of cheese, sour cream, rice and veggies. we were a group of vegetarians and much to our relief all their entrees had a vegetarian option! their quesadillas and nachos were to die for.. we would recommend this place to all tourists who visit singapore
4
Burrito was good - big size, cooked very well, tasty, and it didn't fall apart in my hands. Chips were fresh, but a bit of salsa for both would have been nice. My wife wasn't sure about the guac - they checked on the ingredients and even let her taste it first. They also went out of their way to double check my order, so bonus points there for quality and service. It is a bit on the pricey side, but I'd go back again
5
Bountiful Plates
Delicious Chilis
Refillable Drinks

Best mexican I have tasted in a while and great servings. We couldnt finish the enchilda. Best thing was the owner gave us freshly cooked churros on the house!

Filling Mexican meal with great choice. The nachos were great especially with the lovely guacamole dip. Burritos were just the right size and the quesadillas were pretty tasty.

My virgin try with mexican food. Tried taco wrapped with chicken meat. The chicken meat is so good, esp with grilled cheese.

One of the yummiest mexican food I have in Singapore so far! :)
Everything was fresh and done very well. My favourite was the quesadillas!

I had the best quesadillas ever. These were overflowing with warm melted cheese with succulent pieces of spicy chicken. These were served to us with guacamole, sour cream and tomato salsa. The warm nachos and the salsa bar were a perfect combination with this. The place is a nice and warm place with great music. It was a nice and casual setting which was exactly what me and my friends wanted. A great addition to the food scene in Singapor

We liked this place for their great burritos and tacos. Their burritos are huge and filling and very fresh. The ambience is very lively with great music and pleasant service staff. Best dishes - burritos, tacos and lime margaritas Can avoid - fajitas Secret tip - they have happy hour all day. The second drink is for half the pric

Loved the food that we ordered: Quesadilla, Chicken Burritos, Tacos & Nachos. The Nachos were addictive especially when dipped with their salsa together with sour cream! I enjoyed also the Guacamole, the taste is right and blended with right spices. I don't mind eating the same over and over again. Yummy!! :

Baja Fresh's quaint and fresh food was just plain delicious! I tried Baja Fresh as my friend was craving for Mexican food. We had a wonderful experience at the outlet. The waiters were quick to respond and served our needs impeccably. We then realised that they do delivery for party packs and order for our home party. It was great especially the quesadilla & nacho chips! Look forward to more yummy varieties

We visited Baja Fresh Mexican Grill twice during our 4 day stay in Singapore. The cheese nachos was by far my favourite. The place has a casual, relaxed ambiance with a lot of character. The food tasted very fresh. Tip: Try the Quesadillas and Fruity Sangria. They are MUST HAVES!!

The staff just didn't seem to know how to put the food together. It was presented very disjointedly. The taste was there but presentation was definitely lacking and it just made the food less appetising.

It is quite refreshing to have this affordable and delicious tex-mex restaurant in Singapore. Burritos are great and fulfilling. Margaritas are cheap!!

Getting the best mexican burrito with chicken and churros in town. Value for the price and will come back for more next time!

I have tried various Mexican restaurants in Singapore. But Baja Fresh has proved to be the only authentic US Mexican food in Singapore. I have had Baja Fresh in the USA. Hence I was very excited when I came to know that they have opened in Singapore. I loved the ultimo burrito and my friends ordered the fajitas and quesadillas. We all were very happy with our food. They give free nacho chips and salsa with all the entrees. We loved the fresh salsa bar where we could get a free flow of all their different salsas. Glad that we can enjoy Baja Fresh in Singapore. :

the place has great ambience. The burritos were very fresh and yummy. We also loved their signature lime margarita pitcher. It was good for 4 of us. The best thing I liked on the menu was their tacos and quesadillas. We will definately come back again with our friends

This is the second time Ive tried Mexican food. I had a really good impression towards Mexican cuisine since I tasted once in Hungary. Nacho cheese is always my favourite sauce. Baja Fresh Mexican produces really good Mexican cuisine, and surely it didn't disappoint me! The baja burrito is just awesome. The ingredients are very raw and original: just guacamole and pico de gallo, but together wrapped with Melted Jack cheese,it creates you a very hearty experience of dining! Simple, yet wonderful. delicioso :

I have eaten Mexican food in many places in Singapore. I must say that Baja Fresh probably offers the best flavors. It is set up as a casual dining place. So it was great for me to host a party with friends. Their Quesadillas and Tacos were very good. We had their frozen margarita which was very much needed given it was a very hot afternoon. Service was very good and the food was fresh and tasty. We spent roughly $18 - 20 per person

Always been a fan of Mexican food and Baja Fresh really satisfy that craving every now and again. Dropped by for their Halloween Trick or Treat deal and is was soo worth it. Amazing churros, perfectly hot, crisp and sweet with a generous coating of cinnamon! The margaritas were also a hit with all my friends. Not to mention the warm service staff who went the extra mile to get seats for my friends and I Go for the deal before it ends

I have visited Baja Fresh Mexican Grill for the first time and I do love the Mexican food here! Back in Hong Kong there aren't a lot of Mexican food shop with good values.But here I found it with good value - I ordered a burrito with chicken - I love the freshness of the chicken - with the cream sauce & cheese & veggie inside. A healthy choice for dinner.It is also a nice & chilling place to hang out with your friends after work. I enjoyed it and will definitely come back in the near future
