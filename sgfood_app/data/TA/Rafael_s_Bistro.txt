Their pizzas from Cold Storage are better at Cold Storage. Small, tasteless, service is not nice.....

Walked by this place in search of a cold drink and some food on a Saturday afternoon. The city was very quiet at the time but this place was open so we sat out front on the bar stools which was a nice atmosphere, great to relax and watch the people go past. Staff were reasonably friendly, Iâ€™d say maybe the service could be tweaked slightly. But of confusion with the drinks we ordered and food given to the wrong person but as a whole, pretty good. Food was nice, a bit of room for improvement on some of the dishes but it was tasty and hot and fresh. Not 10/10 yet but a very chilled little bar with big potential.
