The tranquil environment, classy ambience makes Sixty40 a wonderful venue to celebrate special occasions with loved ones and friends. Definitely returning in future for the great variety of food and beverages!

Great food, great service~
A great place to chill after work or whenever you need a place to relax and space out.

Just outside the hotel, and so dropped in for beers outside. Beers were on offer, that that was even better.

Tried their executive lunch menu today. Ordered chicken steak and it comes with free flow of soup, salad and juices. The pumpkin soup was simply great! All in all, a great lunch deal for only S$ 10.90.

This restaurant/bar is a pleasant surprise. We got to know it through the entertainer app and was here on a Saturday night. Great vibes with a resident singer on acoustic guitar who was very interactive. Food was decent. Prices were fairly reasonable. It’s a nice place to unwind after a day’s work or if you like to enjoy a quiet evening. Staff was quick and polite.

A good place to chill after a hard day’s work. Reasonably priced drinks and food (bar chow or dinner). There is an acoustic musician who sings well and excellent with the guitar. If you want to chat. You can always sit outside. Near Bounavista MRT and bus stop

We went here many many times for the dinner and music. The food is great as always. Don't miss their BEEF BURGER and DIY platter. The staffs are attentive, the music is great for chill out. I'm calling everyone who stays or works in Buona Vista, One North, Biopolis, Fusionopolis area to come to this place with your family or co-worker after work to relief your stress day. They have darts game too! Strongly recommended
5
A great place to have a drink and a casual meal. Service is great. The live music in the evenings is a treat.
5
Enjoyed dinner and drinks. Service was excellent. The mushrooms and truffle fries are a must! A nice venue and experience
5
Nice cooling place to hangout! Friendly stuff and the dart game with only $2 per game up to 4 pax can play.
5
Can't fault the food or entertainment (not every night) here. I particularly like the prawn dishes but they also do tapas type dishes that are good quality and not expensive. The surroundings (high rise buildings) are the best but not the water features help.
5
Live music here was good. I visited this place on a Friday. Look out for Peter, The solo guitarist who performed many of his solos and sang many of my Glee favourites too. There is free flow of fries every friday nights for your information. If you come here with friends, get the platter for 5. Some of the food you must order is the chicken wings, beef tataki, Japanese skewers, truffle fries and samba cheese pizza. Happy TGIF-ing

A hole in the wall bar-restaurant that has a decent selection of bar grubs from cheese stuffed hamburger to designing your own food platter according to the number of people in your dining group. It is an interesting concept which allows you to cater to the different tastes of your party, and the portions were generous. I just wished the kitchen was more flexible in allowing a change of sides from fries to a salad. Table water was provided.
5
I had lunch there yesterday, drawn by the menu and bargain lunch special touting unlimited drinks, salad and soup. I'll be doing it again. Also had dinner there, including a couple of cold Erdingers and a pizza. Delicious thin crust and great sauce and toppings. Great atmosphere and wine selection too. Very relaxing.

After a very disappointing experience at Da Paolo just opposite, we found this nice place where the staff was so nice that make us consider coming back soon!The staff was always looking for ways to please us as we were requesting for a funny combination of hard liquor and hot water and lime for our friend who had sore throat. Kudos to you guys!
5
Very accommodating staff whether you are sitting outside or inside. Our large group spent the late evening, and early morning enjoying our requests for music from the bartender and his ipad. If you need a place to relax and have fun, this is it. They have enough beer, mixed drink, and spirit options to make anyone happy

My husband and I wanted to have some drinks and light snacks near our place. Chanced about this place. We were sitting outside, there was a strong constant wind, very cooling. They have happy hour $6+ for half pint of Heineken. We ordered the truffle fries and beef skewers. The beef skewers turned out not so good, we couldn't bite through. The service staff gave us chicken skewers on the house. They were all friendly and smiley, made our evening more enjoyable.. We will be back again.
4
A pity we only got to choose between 5 dishes for 1for 1 on the entertainer app. Good pasta served, fresh prawns used. Value lunch was pretty worth it too, on weekdays!
3
This restaurant always has live bands at night and seems relatively popular. Mixed drinks are very average and beer tastes like the beer taps need cleaning. Food is ok. Service isn't very good, try one of the restaurants and bars in Rochester Park instead.

I had made my reservation with comment that it will be a birthday celebration for my wife. We were and delighted surprised with a birthday song and a little token of birthday cake.
Food was great and the staffs were friendly.
4
Had a pleasant experience at sixty40. Was lost and called the bar, and the lady promptly came out to fetch my friend and I there. Overall comfortable ambience and food and drinks were fine.
4
Used the Chope app to make a reservation at the last minute and they replied within minutes. Cool! Nice pub like ambience. Food is it bad too.

Sixty40 provides a great ambience for a long night of great catch-up with friends. The surrounding is relatively quiet. In the cafe, pleasant hits played through the night. There's also a corner for a game of darts. Food was great - tried the seafood pizza and beef burger. Service was excellent too

Things didn't go well in the office today. It has been a long week. You and your team just finished a project and you want to celebrate.Then you will love this place located in Rochester mall. Live music provided by well selected good musicians. Yet it is quiet and cozy enough to have a conversation. The beer is cold and the bar chow goes well with the beer.A great place to unwind. We went there on a Saturday and there was this musician with great versatile voice with wide repertoire of songs amd great with his guitar.Try it. Now
4
I come to this place not for food which is average but for the atmosphere and drinks. It is a small neighborhood bar but it plays live music at least 3 days every week and they always have some promotions for drinks. Plus they have Guiness on tap

First and foremost, you might need a good stroke of luck to randomly chance upon this place after a few other more attractive stores in the vincinity. Yes it was not easy trying to locate this store despite me tirelessly trying my best to find it (google map can only do so much). More signs to direct would have been much appreciated especially for people who wandered towards starbucks.The food quality was decent for a snack or might be filling for a meal if you are a small eater. The cost however in relation to food portions were a more than a tad pricey. Fortunately for them, I had Groupon to spur me on and the need to experience something new drove me to get 2 sets of the 3 orders (design your platter). Would recommend the special drumlets and my favourite would be the mushrooms (just personally).The staff, it was a singular staff serving about 8 tables. She had to whizz in and out of the kitchen alebit a stressed housewife. Had to pity her and luckily there was water served prior to the food.Would not recommend coming for more times, probably for special occasion. Seems like there is a side for a live band and some darts shooting area which I did not explore or experience
5
Service by staff were excellent, but the owner did not seem to be very interested in serving other customers. Otherwise, must compliment the staff for their excellent service! Very friendly and approachable too.Food was very good, tried their burgers and the patties were good. Price is abit on the high side but their happy hour drinks are pretty value for money. Nice and chill place to spend an evening. Will definitely be back
5
very nice place to chill out. you should try the truffle fries and buffalo wings. Happy hours provide very good deal on weekdays. Very near to bouna vista mrt as well
5
This place is getting better and better with friendly staff and competent management. Every time I come back the food is better! Keep it up!

The food is nice, but definitely not worth. If it weren't for the Groupon deal, my family would not have decided to eat here. We ordered the Classic Fries, Garlic Prawns, Beef Tataki (2 portions), Crispy Drumlets, and Ribs. The only food item I will consider ordering again is the drumlets, other than that, the rest are mediocre. Mcdonald's fries are more tasty and worth it, one portion of the beef was well done while the other was medium rare (not consistent).You can check out a more detailed review on my blog (link in my profile), but overall, I won't eat here again. I can't seem to upload photos here (the upload is not loading, the file might be too big), so head over to my blog for the photos

Came here for dinner with family and ordered food from their "D.Y.P. - Design Your Platter" section.The price on the menu was $12 per item, and $29 for 3 items. We ordered Classic Fries, Garlic Prawns, Beef Tataki, Crispy Drumlets, and Ribs.We were really disappointed with the serving size. The same amount of fries would cost less than $4 at a nearby Fast Food Restaurant (and it costs $12 here!!). Our platter had 3 pieces of ribs, 5 prawns, and 5 drumlets. The beef would probably cost less than half the price here.The food weren't fantastic in taste. We would consider them only average.Basically, we felt that we didn't get value for money. The food was grossly overpriced (comparatively, their own executive set lunch was more worth it). Definitely not worth a repeat visit

Was here on a weekday for lunch with a client.We ordered the Executive Set Lunch, since the price seems to be reasonable.The lunch came with free-flow of soup-of-the-day (Pumpkin soup, when we were there), greens salad, drinks (lemonade and water).I ordered the Grilled Chicken Steak. The portion was reasonable, though the taste was unmemorable. The place was not crowded during the weekday, and the music being played was not overwhelmingly loud. We were able to have a decent conversation during lunch.If you are looking for a place to chat and have lunch (and don't mind the mediocre food), this would be a nice place to visit. However, if you want good food, go somewhere else

Rochester is a little away from the regular places but its places like this that seem to even things out. Located next to the Park Avenue hotel this place offers great food and great options in seating. I loved the food they served but the only gripe was the poor wifi that does not cover out door seating and some of their servers do not care for patrons having a meal and take their smoke breaks right next to you.

We went to Sixty40 for our lunch break. They have only 3 main dishes, salad and soup. The three main dishes today were Baked Chicken (thigh) with curry mash potatoes. fish fingers (deep fried) and seafood pasta (olive oil and lots of garlic). I chose pasta which was ok but not great, my husband chose Chicken and it was also so so. Soup and salad comes with every dish and they were good. Service was extremely slow. It took almost 40mn for our meals to arrive. Staff were very friendly and hard working
1
Went there with 5 colleagues for exec lunch. Food was bland, not really tasty, pasta was overcooked. Fish fingers don't come with a side dish. Chicken breast was soggy. Waitress was nice but somewhat inefficient. At least it's not expensive if you stick to the special menu. Their homemade sodas are nice. It's probably ok for an after work drink and some finger food, but not for lunch/dinner. But one thing: they don't serve tap water. That's right, it's not like they charge you a small amount for ice water, they simply don't serve it. You are forced to buy bottled water at 2$ for a small bottle. Unacceptable in my book and a reason for us to never return
1
We ordered two executive lunch set, the grilled chicken chop and fish and chip. On top of that, you can choose either salad or free flow pumpkin soup.Both set don't taste nice. The chicken chop has a lot of fats and tasteless. The gravy was watery. The batter for the fish and chip was quite thick to cover the mini fish. They don't serve plain water. I won't recommend after this experience
4
Designed like a sixty's era pub.Good selection of beers, cocktails and spirits. Outside the happy hours the prices are a bit on the higher side. The selection of pub-food was tasty and wholesome. They have an oldish gentleman with a guitar singing 60's and 70's songs. Overall this place has a nice relaxing ambience. Only the service was slow and not upto standards
