I took my daughter there in Mid December for breakfast. Aleena sells the best waffles in Singapore! She makes the batter from scratch. My daughter told me they were the best she has ever had anywhere. Friendly service and good food! Well worth a visit.

little cafe with surprising good menu of pork burger and sausage hash, and free flow sparking for 35 per head is a steal

I stayed in the hotel and had breakfast in the cafe. It has a nice atmosphere and is clean and modern. I have met the owner before as I stay in the hotel regularly. She is very extrovert and proud of her place. The coffee is good quality and the service is very friendly. My croissant was fine, but the small bit of very watery scrambled egg and the two small slices of half baked bacon did not quite make if for me for $12. Especially when I had a lovely croissant with beautifully done scrambled eggs around the corner on Foch rd the day before for $6 (without bacon though). As the coffee was good and other dishes going past seemed fine, I ll give it 3 points

Came here at about brunch hour. Sat around to do some work on the laptop. The cafe was never full but noticed a few small groups of people, seemingly having a meeting over a meal. Good place for that I think. Tables had flowers and a rustic feel. Liked how the atmosphere was. Had mushroom soup. Nice but small portion. Ribena with lychee? I think. Standard sweet, cafe drink. And a stack of nutella pancakes. It was the most disappointing. The pancakes seem like a combination of dense cake and biscuit. Entirely tasteless by itself. Couldn't finish the sad stack of 3. Had more expectations out of pancakes priced like that. Definitely wasn't worth it. May come back to try their Burger and improved menu in future

We stayed at Hotel Yan and on our first morning had breakfast here while making a plan for the rest of the trip. Like a lot of Singapore it was quite expensive but the food was very good, as was the coffee and the service was very friendly and helpful. Would recommend

They have one of the best Restaurant food and menu in the area. the lady who manages the place is very lovely and always made sure to provide what we wanted. Our son enjoyed every meal there and usually finished his kid's meal and he's just 2- which means it was really yummy

This review is about the Tyrwhitt Little Cafe, which is run by the owner of Nido Cafe and is just across the street on the ground floor of the Parc Sovereign Hotel.We first went into the cafe by chance when we were on a walk in the area, and we were so happy having found this little jewel. It is run by a lovely, very friendly and communicative lady. She opened the cafe just three weks ago, so everything is really new. The cafe itself isn't very big, but it is beautifully furnished and the atmosphere is nice. We went there every day to get our morning coffee. The owner is very hospitable and tries to make your stay as pleasant as possible. She sells self baked cakes, croissants and other pastries / biscuits. The cakes were really delicious, we can defintely recommend them.Anoher thing that you should definetly try is the coffee she sells. She developed her own mixture of beans with a very individual taste. Her coffee tasted very smooth and just delicious, but it was still strong, but not bitter at all. You can get a hot coffee, an ice coffee, hot / cold chocolate (very good, too) and different teas.Everybody who's in this area should definetly pay this little hidden treasure a visit to enjoy a slice of cake and a coffee. A MUST-GO for everyone visiting Tyrwhitt Road.We will be back for sure

I went to cafe Nido shortly after i arrived in Singapore. I have to eat light and clean food, for health reasons and was in a desperate search for a cafe to frequent through out my stay. And that is how i stumbled upon cafe Nido. The first breakfast i had there was enough to convince me that i have found my cafe for the entire trip. In fact, i even went as far as switching the hotel i was staying and moved to the hotel Yan, where cafe nido is located, to make sure that i had easy access to the cafe on an everyday basis. The food was exactly what i needed. Healthy and made with love. The owner is the warmest, kindest, dedicated and very lovely woman, who made me feel at home through out my 3 weeks. The food was customised to my personal likings and i was offered different dishes to accommodate my health conditions. I dined there every single day until my departure feeling like i was at home the whole time. I cannot stress enough how nice the owner and staff have been to me. If you are looking for a place to eat where everything is made with care, love and utmost dedication, Nido is definitely the right pick. I have appreciated the ambience, the service, the yummy food and ever-warm smiles of the staff. I have definitely found my favourite cafe in Singapore and i look forward to going there again. Many thanks for the exceptional food and hospitality

While staying at the Hotel Yan, we used the Nido quite often for breafast and to have a coffee/snack now and again. Located inside the lobby of the hotel and there is another part across the road from the hotel. The owner is really friendly and extrovert and can be a bit pushy, but I found her charming. The food is good, though the portions are small and the service is woefully slow when served by the staff (service by the owner is much more efficient and speedier). It's not cheap, especially when you consider the fact the there are many other places close by where you can eat for less than half the price. Do recommend the Singapore coffee and the milo, which are fantastic

We were so lucky to be staying at the Hotel YAN, otherwise, we may not have tried Cafe NIDO. We ate here for breakfast twice, and in all, we got to try the berry pancakes with fresh raspberry compote (delicious), the french toast cubes (worth the wait!), the open-faced mushroom sandwich (perfect for a heartier option), and the full English-style breakfast. Everything was delicious, especially the cappuccinos! The owner is a wonderful and gracious host, and she even made sure to see us off upon our check-out from the hotel. We only wished we were around during other mealtimes to try some of the lunch/dinner options.

It was a perfect start to the morning with a delicious filling breakfast served with wonderful presentation, grace and love.

We had the charcoal brioche and sous vide eggs. Was deliciously different to traditional cafe food - please try this dish! Staff are attentive and owner is passionate about local food and cooking. Highly recommended.

Stayed in the hotel above and after the first breakfast kept returning as the food was great quality, served quickly and the coffee was good.

The food at Cafe Nido is really nice and thus, we came back for more; this time we ordered the "Big Bird Breakfast & SPG" and again, it was sumptuous! Not only the ambiance is cosy, the cafe owner is extremely friendly and warm. If you are looking for good tasty food, this place is highly recommended

My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Yan which is where Cafe Nido is located. We had coffee and breakfast at Cafe Nido each of the three mornings we were there - and would have had lunch there too if we were around the hotel during the lunch hour. The owner (Nicole-Marie?) is so personable and extremely passionate about her restaurant and the quality food she serves. Her coffee, pancakes (chocolate and berry), egg breakfasts, freshly made croissants, baked beans, chicken sausage, bacon, etc. were excellent! Her food is made fresh with each order so if you're expecting "fast food" style food, this is not it. It's well worth the wait though!! The portions are not enormous but we left each morning feeling content and ready for the day. We did not get hungry again until well after lunchtime. I recommend Cafe Nido wholeheartedly!! Hope to get to go back to Singapore again one day and visit with Nicole-Marie and Cafe Nido again one day

When I first stepped into this restaurant, I thought I had walked in to a hotel lobby instead of a restaurant. Then it dawned on me that this place actually had a shared lobby with the restaurant!Not that I'm complaining but I can understand why they did this (due to lack of space). And yes, I am impressed that they came up with this innovative idea of sharing the restaurant space with hotel guests who needed a bite/drink while they wait for their rooms to be prepared.So I ordered a Pan-seared Salmon, and a Pork Burger. Both were excellent and really tasty. The pork fillings was well mixed and had very little "impurities" (i.e, bones, ligaments, fillers, etc) - I was quite amazed at the food quality served here.The sunny side up that came with the burger was a perfect sunny side-up, i.e., no burnt edges, just semi-runny white and yolk all the way round!The salmon came on top of mashed potato that was mashed to a paste/puree texture - very good as well.To end off the food, we ordered the lime tartlets which was $3.50 for two small bite-sized pieces. It was small, but you could taste the zing of lime flavour within.Wrapping up the food with a Long Black - this was pretty decent, but nothing to shout about.All in all, the servers were very friendly and prompt with their services.Oh, and this place doesn't impose any service charge. Just browse the menu and order/pay at the counter. Your food will be served to you

When i see the scores of other people they must have had a bad day when we visited.This restaurant is inside the Hotel Yan and serves western style food. The first day we like to visit it was closed. We gave it another shot next day.We had 2 cappucino's , my friend had the english breakfast and i ordered the french toast. My friends english breakfast was okay but the portion size is small, My french toast came about 10 minutes late wich was allready dissapointing since my friend had finished allready.( we where the only customer in the restaurant) The taste of the frenchtoast was strange, i did not finish it because i was scared something was wrong with it. My friend an i both tasted the dish and my best guess it was garlic bread dipped inside cinamon and egg. Not a nice experience will not visit again

Having read another food review about the noodles at this place was too salty, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered the same item. The chef had obviously read that same review as the noodles tasted just nice. The egg was runny as it should be, and the brioche was one that I enjoyed
5
Great food and service. Located within Hotel Yan, decor is modern, interesting and comfortable. Breakfast highlights were the crispy bacon, coffee (the perfect latter), and own made beans & tomato sauce, had the tasty pumpkin salad over a lunch, and one evening had the ribeye steak. I'll be back. Thank you
