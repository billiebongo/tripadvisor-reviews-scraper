Amazing ice creams!
Lovely little place.
Waffles are superb.
A good qty for the price too.
Beat to go in a group.

For adventurous ice-cream lovers, try their signature ice-creams with alcohol such as the popular wineberries with cranberries in port ice-cream made from red wine and is indeed refreshing. The different types of ice cream really live up to the name. Taking their earl gray and horlicks are like drinking the beverages in solid form. This location is far from madding crowd tugged at the corner of a small mall called The Village

Siglap has two ice cream parlours within one kilometre of each other, the other being Haagen Daaz, but it seemed as if everyone was packed into Udders this night. The noise levels were deafening, especially from a children's birthday party that took up half the dining area.Yes, they do serve dishes such as pasta and burgers here, but it was the ice cream that we were here for. They had the usual 'best sellers' such ad maoshanwang durian, but we could not find the attap chee or lychee flavours. In the end we went for chocolate with some orange liquor and earl grey. I liked the earl grey, as it had a subtle flavour and was creamy and rich.Prices start from $4 for a normal scoop, and $4.90 for a premium scoop, up to $6.90 for special flavours. They also have signature sundaes, including Berry Manilow.The young crew are very friendly and will provide little spoonfuls of samples on request

My family loves coming here when we want outstanding icecream. Either eat in or grab a take away which can be packed for travelling in insulated bags for you. My favourite flavour is snickers, Mars and Honeycomb, and my wife loves the indulgent chocolate varieties. The sizes are reasonable sizing. They also have floors for adults that have alcohol in them. Haven't had them but they look good too. I haven't got past my favourite flavour
