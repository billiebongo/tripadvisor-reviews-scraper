Food is nice, this restaurant have the vintage field. I chose pho which tasted nice although i am not sure if that is authentic.

Have been there quite a number of times since I moved to Singapore. Comparing to other Vietnamese restaurants, this one has something to talk about. It's a little gem. Loved the pho and spicy beef noodle soup. Oh wait, and try the rolls. Yum!

Lunch alone on a rainy day - comforting soup and generous portions. One of those eat and leave places that you can count on for a fuss free lunch.

This is one among the authentic taste Vietnamese restaurant in the city area. Service is quick, the portions are adequate if not more than other restaurants. Price is also considerable.

The broth is great and amazing. The spring roll is fresh and tastly. The vietnamese coffee is thick and flavourful.
Definitely one of the best pho places in Singapore

Ordered the chicken pho and some rolls. The portion was huge and really delicious. However the roll, the prawn wasn't fresh and had that fishy stale taste to it. Didnt quite enjoy the rolls. The service was fast but they could have been more friendlier towards their customers

I went to Pho 99 Vietnamese Delights for lunch, and although the food was OK, it wasn't anything that left an impression. I have had better tasting pho in Singapore.The Vietnamese coffee was good and the service was acceptable.All in all, I would recommend this restaurant for a quick lunch, but not for having a nice dinner

We went to this place with a Vietnamese colleague just before lunch. We were seated quickly, but moments later, a queue of diners started to form outside. Soon, I found out why - Pho 99's food is simply satisfying. We got their house specialties: pho bo (beef and noodles in clear broth) and fresh spring rolls, with the latter serving as the appetizer. Dipped in sweet vinegar sauce, the rolls were tasty and fresh, especially with the presence of shrimps slices and small mint leaves. The pho bo was light in taste at first, but the big bowl serving made it truly filling. Overall, 'twas a fantastic meal. Try squeezing a slice of lime at the beginning for that extra tang.

I went with a Vietnamese friend who is missing his pho bo. His opinion is of course not as good as Ho Chi Minh.Obviously like Ipoh ho fun, you can only get authentic if it s as good as that served in Vietnam.It s nowhere as good or cheap as that in Melbourne (Springvale, Richmond or Footscray) where they used fresh australia beef (not frozen) and where you get loads of tau geh and basil leaves. Here they give you some taugeh leaves but no taugeh on a plate! Anyway it s ok not great but definitely better than Nam Nam, the chain

If you like Vietnamese food, this is a great place to visit for lunch. Its a very small restaurant and you might need to share a table, but the food is great - very tasty with the option for added spice!

Authentic Vietnamese cruising is what I'm looking for. I order my usual slices beef noodle. The broth, superb and the prawn roll with the sauce, fantastic. To all tourist, please do come and enjoy it.

One of the better pho I have had! Simple place with local Vietnamese serving you........... Slices beef was tender and the soup was good

Since my first visit exactly a year ago, Pho99 has improved its servings, enhanced its menu, deployed more staff and slightly better decor. During previous peak hours, I had to wait in queue. This time round, they had better patron management. I though Pho Ga was much tastier than before, as was Pho Bo. I had hoped they would have traditional Vietnamese desert. Maybe we would see this in a year's time? For the two of us, 3 main dishes, 1 side dish of fried spring roll and 2 ice-coffee, the damage was a mere S$ 29.

First off, this restaurant is packed during lunch hours. The service is super quick (probably to make sure the line out the door doesn't run too long). The pork chop (with rice) dish they have is tastier than most of the other Vietnamese places that offer this dish. The Pho Bo, however, could use some improvement. The broth is too lightly flavoured, the noodles are overcooked and too soft, the meats could be tastier, and the condiments (thai basil, etc., proper sauces, were lacking in variety and quantity). Is it worth a shot? If you like Pho, I'd say yes. It's probably one of the better bowls in Singapore and your preferences may be different than mine

I've became quite addicted to Pho Bo, so I'm always looking for a different place to try it.Luckily I have a vietnamese colleague who told me about this place.When the Pho arrives at your table, you can immediately smell that sweet aroma of perfect seasoning and herbs and everything that makes your mouth watery. The slices of meat are perfectly cooked and thin. The broth is just perfect, and I wonder how marvellous this would be on a cold, rainy day.The one on Amoy st. is usually fully crowded on lunch time, but just go a bit later, after 13:00

This is a nice find in the cbd. It really has delicious pho with a good beef broth that's not too heavy. The beef slices are really fresh and the pho I had was well-balanced and satisfying. Definitely worth a visit if you're craving for Vietnamese food

We had pho (both the slice beef and meat balls one), prawn rice rolls, dried beehoon and a chicken cutlet with rice. I would say that everything we had was delicious. The prawn rolls are especially good. The pho soup is very authentic and refreshing. The ice milk tea and lime juice is good too. Feels like we were in Vietnam with the homey ambience and authentic taste and service. Would recommend

I visited Pho 99 for a late lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant was almost full. The staff was very friendly. I ordered the pho bo vien nam (sliced beef with meat balls), goi cuon (fresh rice spring rolls) and tra chanh da (ice lemon tea). Having just vacationed in Vietnam I was looking forward to a bowl of beef pho. Unfortunately, this pho was just okay. The noodles were overcooked. There wasn't much flavor to the broth. The spring rolls were delicious. The tra chanh da was refreshing

Nice location right in CBD. Because it is near the major banks, stock exchange and offices of MNCs Pho99 is always full. We had to stand in line to await our turn. Chicken and beef pho were delicious just like those in HCMC. We had Vietnamese spring roll and omlettee. Complete with Vietnamese coffee served from a glass jar warmed by a lighted candle. Fun ! The price was just about right. Suggest 2 main item and 1-2 side dishes for 2 pax. Sets you back by no more than $60. Visitors can add this restaurant to their program on their way to walking around the financial district and Marina Bay
