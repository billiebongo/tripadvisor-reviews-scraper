Food was very average for the price that we payed. RAS which is almost next door has far better food at the same price. The take-away took a very loooong time...almost an hour

This is the best opportunity for the Indians if you have in Singapore to have Indian Food & Dance on the tune of Bollywood Music..
Located at the center of the night life in Clark quay....must visit the place...

First time at Maziga. Had heard good (choice food items) and bad (service) stuff before deciding to give it a go. Pretty good all around. The tacos, quesadillas, lamb, chicken bites and even the humble tomato soup was good. Will return.

nice place, located in clark quai, has 2 sections , one for dinning and for private parties and functions'

If you also crave for Bollywood music and dancing on Dhol then this is the place to be. Best is they don't have girls dancing like other bolly clubs in Singapore. DJ plays very good music . The catch is you have to pay 20$ cover charges for which you get a drink of your choice in return from the bar.The place only opens at 10pm and only gets alive post 12am. You can reserve the seat in advance if you buy a bottle from the club. Staff is nice and service is good. Must visit.

I organized a corporate party at Maziga for 35 pax; dinner buffet on a weekday.First of all, it is an unusual place for dinner as Clarke Quay is generally considered for pubs and clubs. This place turned out to be really different.Ambience: Transparent glass doors, Bar counter and enough seating with some cool frames hanging on the wall, makes it a perfect place for outting - friends, family, romantic or corporate.Service: It was quick. People were polite, accommodated all the requests they could and ensured high standards.Food: Tasty! In our party, Mr. Sudarshan and Mr. Javed (both present personally), the starters were served non-stop. There were few surprise elements too. (additional dishes not in the pre-decided menu). Everyone gave a positive feedback on food and service. I loved Gulab jamun, Starters and Pista Kulfi.Presentation: It was noticeably good. That makes them unique, it was all the worth!Price: Medium to High- as per Clarke quay standards - Menu is available on their website! If you are looking for organizing party, you can customize menu and talk to Mr. Javed (Chief Chef)Location: Can't get any better!Overall experience: Top class. We played few games. We had our own section in restaurant and people had a good time.Recommend if you are a tourist or a local

We went for a weeknight dinner to Maziga.Sadly for us, they had a party of 15 guests at a table, so the rest of us smaller tables were sorely ignored in terms of service and food turnout.The food was good and the presentation very interesting. However the quality did not seem too great, maybe our smaller orders were not given enough attention. Like the lamb burgers we ordered, were presented beautifully, but the burger buns were cold. The pani puris were super leaky since most seemed to have a hole or crack so we ended up eating the puri and the pani separately. We did not even ask for a replacement since the order had taken close to 35 minutes to come in the first place !Given that the food was good, I might venture there again, but only if I see no large groups there !!

If one is aware of the Clark Quay area one can easily find Maziga serving Indian cuisines... the food came out fast.. the staff was polite...but the food lacked flavours... out of 10 I would give a 5.5 ... a little thing they need to do is place a cover for their area where they keep the plates and. where the orders come from...hoping for improvement..

Food with a twist.. It's tasted great and hits all our taste buds.. Starters were sizzling ..we had chaats,it was with a twist,paneer tikka was soft ,roti pe boti was Creative.... Biriyani was tasty and cook to perfections,it came with raita ... Naan were soft and tasted yummy with butter chicken.. Palak paneer was authentic....Mocktails were great and went well with our food ... It was a good experience and totally worth the money.. Staff was polite and special thanks to the manager Mr Sudarshan who was well verse with the food..

Haven't had this kind of fusion Indian food and I must say that I strongly recommend this eatery. Just let them suggest the starters and take you to the main course, you won't go wrong. Oh Yes, not forgetting the masalah tea. I was so excited with the served starters that I missed some shots but here's the ones I took.

Good food, excellent presentation, decent portion sizes and pleasant staff. Overall, we had a nice evening with the extended family. Will definitely go back.

The menu was flimsy as if it's a hawker center, and the attitude was that of ripoff ...probably aimed at drunk patrons on a weekend. Extremely highly priced, quite tasteless food and not at all appetizing. Avoidable.

Good indian preparations altough service is slow. Like other places in clarke quay it is a lively place always buzzing.
This place if craving for Indian food is a good option

Good food and excellent service. That's exactly what Maziga offers. With its unique menu and cosy charm, it boasts some excellent food with beautiful presentation. We had the Old Delhi Golgappa Chaat, otherwise known as Pani Puri. Little did we expect those sweet little puris to be sitting on miniature chairs on a little garden! The sauces came in test tubes, adding to our delight. Married together, the puris were a flavourful explosion in the mouth. Next came the Maziga Chicken Tikka. Though the portion was a little small, it was hearty and delicious. The chicken was tender and the spice marinade was well-balanced. The chutney drizzle really added that extra Oomph. For our main, we had the Bhatti Da Murgh Quesadilla. This is the dish that's bringing me back for sure. It looked deceivingly simple, but the flavours were so complex. It was the Piece De Resistance of the meal. It was delectable and went amazingly well with the hand crafted Mojitos. I appreciate all the efforts put in by the attentive staff, who never failed to smile every time they served the guests. Special mention to the Manager, Sudarshan, who made our evening special and obliged to our every request, with a smile from the heart. A great place to go to create those fond, sweet memories

We were eager to try out Maziga having read their menu online and seen some of their interesting food presentation photos.We went there twice for dinner and our experience on both occasions was identical.The restaurant has plenty of seating and is open facing the street. The air conditioning was very cold and leaked.We ordered quite a few dishes from their menu.The Ragda Pattice was excellent and the Golgappa chat was very good. The nachos chat was so so.The Olive & Pickle chicken tikka was a bit odd and seemed pretty similar to the Chicken tikka wrap that we ordered.The Railway style sandwich was a bit disappointing unfortunately.The Chyavanprash Cheesecake and the tiramisu were very good though.What marred the experience on both occasions though was the completely clueless staff.They did not understand the menu, missed the orders, had no clue what they were serving and in general appeared to be completely out of sync with their jobs.I hope the restaurant gets it's staff properly trained soon

Visited Maziga for a wine event and we ordered the chicken wings, chicken briyani and french fries. The briyani is really good! A bit spicy but it tastes so awesome! I have always been a lover of spices. I love the dough on the top of the rice too! The french fries were awesome too! I'll be back for more, that's for sure

A huge fan of Punjab Grill, we had high expectations of Maziga for Singapore Restaurant Week. The food is nowhere near Punjab Grill standards, from presentation, preparation to flavour. Service was very appalling. Wait staff were MIA most times - they would bring us dishes w/o any explanation, when we asked for a description they confessed they had no idea, they went to find out from the kitchen, and would then come back and check the menu before either giving us the name of the dish (but with no explanation) or hand us the menu to check ourselves. Manager was at the bar most of the night and came at the end to ask if all went well - at which point we were too frustrated to bother. Very disappointing, and again such a disappointment considering the incredible experiences we've consistently had at Punjab Grill

After going to punjab grill last month and having the best meal in singapore outside of home, had similar expectations of Maziga. Extremely disappointed! We ordered vada pav and while it came in a really fancy shape, there was no real taste (salt and spice was very low and it was devoid of garlic!) and when we asked for the garlic chutney as per menu they didn't have it. Next was Pani Puri- and that came in with NOTHING inside the Puris at all! No potatoes, Boondi, Ragda..is that really pani puri??! Next was baked khumb palak korma and palak paneer with rotis. they seemed to be the same gravy, but while one was spicy the other was bland, and the paneer was not even fresh. The Rotis were way too crisp. The manager was informed that we didn't like things so he came to inquire. We gave him the feedback and said we are unlikely to return. so he just goes and sends in two kulfis free of cost that we didn't want- and the newbie server spilled it on our table!(accidental of course -but just rounded up our terrible experience) Its very close to our house and we were really looking forward to going there often, but now..:

Went to watch the india pak world cup t20 match. The place is very nice, the service is prompt, the overall ambience is quite good. Food is great, must try the chicken biryani. Cocktails are ok, not that great have had better. All in all a must visit place in clarke quay.
