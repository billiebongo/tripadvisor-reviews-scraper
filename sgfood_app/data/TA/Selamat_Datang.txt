Long queue but the soto ayam and mee rebus are well worth the wait!

A friend took us here last night and as it was late, there was no queue. The staff were friendly and recommended dishes and there was plenty of choice when I said I was vegetarian. I had three beans and a noodle dish whilst the meat eaters had clams and stingray. The food was amazingly tasty, some if the best we've had in KL and the service was very friendly. We will definitely return here.

I was in the mood for nasi lemak, but the long queues discouraged me. I walked around and spotted this stall that sells Mee Soto and Soto Ayam. There was also a queue of customers which suggests the food could be good. The stall has also garnered some awards for good Mee Soto. I joined the queue and the queue of 4 people was cleared in 5 minutes. I ordered the soto ayam ($3) with an additional bergedil (fried potato patty) for an additional $0.50. The stall owner ladled soup that is boiling in a stainless steel container at the back of the stall, into my order of mee soto. There was cut rice cake, bean sprouts, shredded chicken meat with sliced parsley. Overall good taste and the chilli is potent and spicy. Suggest to put the chilli in side saucer instead of directly into your bowl, if you are afraid of your food being too spicy. The stall also have mee soto ($3), which have the same ingredients as the soto ayam except for the cut rice cakes, and beef tripe soup ($6) which I will try on my next visit. Try it

Ordered the mee soto with extra chicken (add $1). The broth was delicious but the chicken was extremely fatty and they left all sorts of weird parts in the chicken shred. For the hype, I was disappointed in the unhealthy (read FAT) serving. But then again, the broth was tasty...
