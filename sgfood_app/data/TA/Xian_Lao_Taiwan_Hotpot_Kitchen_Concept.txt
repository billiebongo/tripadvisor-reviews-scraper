Food was actually quite fresh. Service was also good saved for a Tiger beer dressed promoter aunty who is quite frustrated.We made reservation very last minute and we had small party. We were put at a table with another couple who already arrived and shared a table meant for 8. Hope this was told to us before hand as both the couple and ourselves felt awkward. Thought it's 'different table' but jointed and we had our own Hotpots, it's still pretty awkward. Nevertheless I still think is good if you are looking for a slightly above average decent steamboat restaurant, for family with kids, noisy but good for price and quality for what you pay. Free parking at Turf City a plus
