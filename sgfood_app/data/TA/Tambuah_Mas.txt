My family and I have been coming to Tambah Mas for lunch and dinners, for many many years. Today we learnt that they are not serving beer anymore. With itâ€™s delicious dishes served and their sambal itâ€™s always very refreshing to go with cold beer.
4
good curry puff...great tahu telor..and also the daun singkong. do not forget to try the dessert. we always enjoy to eat there
4
Great tasting food. Portion can a tad bit more ðŸ˜€
Overall ambience and service is great. Food came rather prompt too
4
The service crew is great and ambience is good for a nice family dinner.
The food as usual (we frequent the restaurant yearly) is authentic!
Don't forget to order the Tahu Telor and Beef Rendang is the best here!
4
The food is good as always, and it is nice and quaint. The beef rendang was meaty and it was of the good cuts of the beef.
4
Great food...since I like Indonesian food. Should try the tahu telor..and also the satay. Dont forget to order the dessert.

Firstly, please note that this review is for the catering menu.The chicken curry was way too salty but the saving grace was the taohu telor which was good. Sayor lodeh was good but the cabbage should have been cut into smaller bite size as the cabbage was quite big and looks like it was only cut into eights.The ladies fingers used was way too old and felt I was chewing an ageing dried squid.The kacang chendol was ok as it lack the lemakness and was way too dilute
3
While food is still good at this establishment thatâ€™s been around for years, itâ€™s grossly overpriced for the portion and quality you get. One can get similar Indonesian food in Arab street for half the cost, at least a third more, and equal or better quality and taste.For nostalgia sake, order the Tahu Telor but beware that a third of it is Tahu, not sure where is the Telor (egg), and most of it is fritters. The beef rendang was tasty, a tad salty but portion was minuscule for the price. Ditto for the Soto ayam. You get the picture.The clincher is they charge for water but at least they are transparent about it as itâ€™s clearly stated on the menu. They donâ€™t tell you that the cost of the plate of emping you get when you are seated will be added to the bill. Ditto for the towels.Not planning to go back ever.

Went here a few times already recently. There are not many choices in Singapore to have a proper Indonesian food in a restaurant. So we had no choice sometimes when we need go indo food. the food taste was good. The drinks were so so only. Anyway, this is singapore, for this price, this was what we can get
5
It's been a while since I visited this restaurant but the quality of its food has remained top-notch. We ordered the Ayam Goreng Istimewa, Ikan Nila Goreng and Singkong Santan. They were all delicious - crispy or spicy enough, not overdone. My only gripe is what they charge for staples - $1.50 for white rice and 50 cents for tap water
3
Was better the previous time I went there. Beef rendang was not tender.
Other food was good. Service so so.
4
Pleased with the quiet environment, food and services . The prices are reasonable too. They have a private room which can House 20 pax with 2 tables
4
I worked in Indonesia some years ago, and I recall the wide variety of food. I had a business lunch with colleagues in this restaurant, and it was quite good. If you like Indonesian food, this restaurant is a good choice.
5
This restaurant had been in my family outing since the seventies. It was the best food that I gave ever tasted and it is the best in the Tanglin branch.
4
the food is delicious, reasonable price and quick service. it will be better if the waitress can smile more. will be back for the good food.
4
Satay was juicy with lovely peanut sauce. Cumi cumi goreng was crispy with just the right amount of sweetness. Tahu telur was flavourful and not too oily. The beancurd in the Gado Gado and Sayur Lodeh was fresh. Dessert was disappointing - because the coconut milk was too thin
3
We had a birthday lunch celebration on a Sunday and their service was somewhat lacking. Perhaps they had some staff away?? Nevertheless, service staff were slow to at least acknowledge us before taking our food orders. Their dishes used to be very good, but after this lunch, we reckon that while several were still nice but some were misses
3
Tahu telur (tofu and egg) was crispy but sauce was too sweet, supposed to have crushed peanut to balance. Satay was more like Malay style than Indo. Sambal ati (liver) was crispy (which is unique) but with no sambal. Oxtail soup was okay. Best thing was only daun singkong (cassava leave), very flavourful
5
Had a team dinner at Tambuah Mas and was impressed by the quality of food. The restaurant was clean and cosy. We went for the set menu and it was generously packaged and we could barely finish them all. The satay, the vegetable curry were exceptional, and the soft shell chilli crab was a nice twist. Would recommend the restaurant to other people
4
Just returned from Bali and my wife wanted to have Indonesian food for dinner with friends here in SG. My first time in one of her Favourite restaurants...Food was very good. Their specialty Tahu Telor was a winner! From Gado gado to satay to rendang, food was quickly delivered and appreciated by our guests. The place was quite busy even though it was in one of the older shopping center - a testimony to its food
5
As an Indonesian, certainly very longing with the taste of Indonesian cuisine. When I try to eat here, it's amazing, it tastes great. Like eating in your own country. Rendang must be the champion!
4
Really enjoyed every visit. Food is delicious, especially the chicken sate. The setting of the restaurant is pretty old school which makes it rather charming.
3
One of the better Indonesia food restaurant which serves above average food in a slightly better environment..
5
We had an excellent dinner here with friendly efficient service and authentic delicious food. The price was good and there was plenty of choice so we returned the next night and enjoyed our meal just as much. Thoroughly recommend.
4
Nice quiet location which is far away from busy crowd. Food was authentic and nice. Price was reasonable and just a few dishes we are already full. Be sure to order the beef rendang, otak and sayor lodah. Must go with the frangance rice.
5
Had a family dinner at this restaurant (needed reservation for 7 people). Excellent Indonesian restaurant with very good service. Very family friendly - one other table was celebrating a birthday and they brought in their own cake for the occasion. Must try the Tahu Telor, Satay, and Rendang. They also make a good chendol for dessert
4
We decided on Tambuah as we have 2 Indonesian colleagues and felt it would be a safe bet. We didn't have reservations but managed to get a table for the 5 of us. It wasn't overly busy and could see a number of people there were enjoying the breaking of their fast. Once we decide what we wanted the orders were taken quite quickly. Sambal udang, rendang daging, tauhu telor, sayur lodeh and fish head curry. Of these the tauhu telor, rendang, sambal udang were the best. Service was average, staff mostly attentive. Overall a pleasant experience for an unrushed evening.
4
Tambuah Mas is almost family to me. There are currently two branches, but the one in Tanglin Shopping Centre holds many great moments and memories.The menu, I can't remember if there were some changes along the way, but let me list down the dishes that you just have to try:Ayam goreng istimewa (traditional fried chicken), rendang lembu (braised coconut-spiced beef), sop buntut (oxtail soup), tahu telor (fried beancurd and eggs), and of course for dessert, cendol (coconut milk and palm sugar). Always great service, great food, and many great moments. Possibly the best halal Indonesian food in Singapore
3
Had the nasi goreng. Was quite oily and tasted so so. Didnt get to try the other food so cant comment on that. Location wise its at the Tanglin Shoppping Centre just next to St Regis and located on the 4th Floor quite hidden at the back.
4
This restaurant is one of the great and tasty one for Indonesia Food Restaurant.Last time I had avocado juice... very tasty.The rendang is one of must try food... it made with beef.... another must try is tahu telor also nice... its made from egg and tofu.Please enjoy and have a nice meal :)
4
The service was rather fast. The food was quite good. The environment was very quiet and comfortable for any occasion. Will definitely come again.
4
Very good quality Indonesian food. Some may find similarities between the now defunct Sanur Indonesian restaurant. Servings have reduced, but quality is not lost.
Fantastic deserts like chendol and sago melaka are a must.
4
Ordered Tahu Telur, Cumi Goreng, Sapi Rendang, Sup Buntut and other dishes for 4 pax. The food is authentic, tasty and the portion is just right. The ambience is cosy and nice too. Come here if you want to satisfy your taste for Indonesian food. All in all, it was a terrific dining experience. I will definitely come again
4
Patronised the restaurant on & off. Favourite dish is the ayam goreng istimewa as the fried spices served on top of the fried chicken provides the kick. The udang belado gravy goes down very well with rice. Would not recommend the fish head as the burner does not last sufficiently to make the dish hot enough. The beef rendang is fantastic while the tauhu telok and satay are well done. Last but not least, avocado is the staple drink to order to make the meal complete
5
I know when a restaurant is good, the kids don't talk cos their enjoying the food too much. Especially the Satay Ayam, Assam Fishhead, beef rendang, Sayur Lodeh, ikan pepes, and not forgetting the desserts, chendol, avocado shakes. Great staff too. Parking not a problem unless u drive an Alphard or big / tall MPV. AllSmiles on each visit. Halal too
5
This is one of the nicest indonesian food in Singapore. If you would like to try Indonesian food... Then you should try this restaurant.Several Indonesian food you can found and taste in here. Try tahu telur... Taste crispy and yummy. If you like beef, you should try rendang. Try ayam gulai, quite juicy...bit spicy and nice taste.Don't forget to try avocado juice,... Its nice one.Hope you like it and have a great time in this restaurant.Regards
4
Service wise, the dishes were served literally 5 minutes after we ordered. This was on a Sunday dinner. I was pleasantly surprised by the quick serving time. We had plenty of dishes and all of them were good with an Indonesian flavour. The mutton curry was soft and easy to chew unlike some other places. Tauhu Goreng was good, the sauce makes it even better. Cost wise, the food here is pretty expensive and you definitely can get similar dishes at much lower costs. Each dish is around $10 on average. What makes the dishes here different would probably be the Indonesian tastes the food are cooked to.Overall pleasant experience, just that it is rather pricey
4
Came here for dinner with family. Not easy to find the restaurant since its up on 4th floor without lift and right at the corner end at a dingy old shopping building at the start of Orchard road.Service was prompt and staff were courteous.Reasonable price items. Would come again to try their tapai dessert and Udang belad
3
Had business meeting lunch today. Food was great but staff need more training. Basically all with sour face , no smile and limited service basic. We could not make up our mind as there are so many food we wanted to try and staff failed to promote the food
3
The food was just OK here in Tanglin.The sate had lots, too much fat, not healthy.The place was dark and rather dirty, the restroom was really dirty, goes to show Singapore's cleanliness claim us overrated. My family all agree.They did not give enough sambal and service was quite slow.The fish head curry was OK, need more flavor though
5
Food was great, service was a bit slow. The ambiance was good for a quick catch up with good friends. It was a bit hard to locate though.
5
Tambuah Mas is a bit difficult to find, on 4th floor in a mall at the very end of Orchard Road, but absolutely worth finding.The staff is friendly and all that, but their Beef Rendang and especially the Tahu Telor is superb. I have never had Tahu Telor elsewhere like this, and I go to Tambuah Mas every time I am in Singapore just for that. Try it
4
We had lunch in this restaurant last time we were in Singapore and we are glad we went back. We still find the food here really tasty and there is a lot of variety. They really can spice it up as well if you want. A lot of seafood and vegetarian options as well. The service is quick and friendly. Its located on the 4th level of A shopping complex on Tanglin Road. Worth a visit
4
Good value for the Orchid area. Food was good, service was very good. I agree with 100% with the Review entitled "A Bit of Ordinary":"Overall, it serves a good afternoon lunch or farewell function but nothing very creative or special."My favorite was probably the Beef Rending, although I've had better at other restaurants
3
We came to this restaurant since a couple we are hosting crave for Indonesian food and requested this place as they had a great time some 5 years ago. This time, it came as a disappointment to them as the quality has definitely dropped (never mind the quantity). The 12 of us ordered Ayam Gor, Ikan Pepes, Tahu Telor, Gado Gado, Kangkong Belecan, Sayur Lodeh as the main dishes to go with white rice, and Cendol and Avacado Juice for dessert. All in, our bill added up to S$251.64. The waiters were attentive and helpful, but the cooking is just so ordinary. We could have enjoyed the same items at some hawker food stalls elsewhere
5
Seems that each Sunday to Orchard Road, we end up ALWAYS at Tambuah Mas, Paragon, Singapore for lunch. We have become regulars, that waiting for a table even how packed it is, a table will be allocated within 5 mins.Eaten with plain white rice - servings aplenty till you say stop, or individual plates of yellow rice... order the following that is mouth watering, sinful rich in coconut milk and spices that makes each dishes so delicious.Tahu telur.Soya bean, fried in egg batter, sweet sauce, shredded cucumbers and bean sprouts. Sop Ayam soto.Rich chicken broth with shredded chicken, glass noodles and bean sproutsOn a cold day this sop (soup) taken with yellow noodles.... serves as a warmer to the body due to the spices in the stock.Sate (Satay)Succulent pieces of chicken, beef, mutton served with thick peanut gravy. Finger licking good.PepesThis is the Indonesian version of Otak Otak. Fish meat wrapped in banana leaf and grilled over a flame. Yet, soft, spicy and flavourable eaten on its own.Singkong Santan.This humble dish is actually tapioca leaves cooked in coconut milk.Rendang.The meat is soft melt in your mouth and tender. Big pieces and yes... not fats in each pieces.Udang (Prawns) with or without erm... beans. A word of caution though... a tad spicy due to the chilli used.For those wanting fried / grilled fish... take the garoupa. 1 fish feeds 6 people. You have been warned. Sayur Lodeh (Mixed vegetables)This dish is a dish that is heaven.A mixture of vegetables slowly cooked in coconut milk and spices. Yet not too soft. Just right with the crunch.This dish, the Malays would add slices of steamed rice = and call it Lontong. â˜ºâ˜ºâ˜ºFor the person(s) who likes their chili... request for their belacan. That relative small dish is a devil in disguise. Belacan (Shrimp paste) with red chili padi.... packs a punch on the tongue.We usually order Lemongrass for our drink. Cold. Yes... its home made and cooling on hot weather. For desserts... try their Ais Chendol. Avacado that comes with gula melaka (palm sugar).
4
The location is at the 4th floor of Tanglin Shopping Center, a 15 min walk from Orchard MRT station if you are not driving. Still quite convenient.The customer service was good as the waiters and waitresses promptly served the food and drinks and took away the empty plates. The ambience was there but it lacks the authentic Indonesian restaurant decoration and look. The front stall operated like a hawker stall where you can takeaways in packets. While it may broaden the customer base to include those staff or workers working at the shopping mall, it a bit of `degraded' the restaurant into a second class hawker stall. The menu set dishes were quite ordinary not very creative. The Ayam Goreng Istimewa was not very special or extraordinary appetizing. I should say that the sate ayam meat was tender and the peanut gravy was not bad though a bit sweet at least not watery. The Ikan Nila Goreng was crispy and nice. I liked the Tahu Telur and the Gado Gado at least these were vegetables. My colleagues found that there were more meat than vegetables. The chilli padi was good and traditional. Overall, it serves a good afternoon lunch or farewell function but nothing very creative or special
3
We have been to this restaurant many times over the years because of its good food. But our last visit was few years back.My daughter decided to come here to celebrate my last birthday. Well, the food is not bad, though not as good as before. It is also quite expensive now. And the portion is very small. Frankly this is not good value - like before. We will not be back here again.We prefer the food at Manis Manis, which was last located at Turf City. It is so much nicer & offer great value. But since Turf City has changed to The Grandstand, this restaurant has left. Not sure where it is now
2
This was a huge disapointment. Worst food I had in three weeks of travelling.My rice was cold. My vegetables were cold and with a pretty tasteless watery curry. The beef rendang was ok, but nothing special. It wasnâ€™t cold, more lukewarm. The lemongrass drink was just some sweet water with a lemongrass stuck inside, at room temperature, so not very refreshing, even with couple of ice cubes. Everything was kind of bland, not spicy at all. And the restaurant is in an ugly shopping mall.This meal cost me 27 dollar. If you like your food overpriced and cold, go to Tambuah Mas. Or do yourself a favour and go to the Lau Pa Sat food court and buy a delicious fried oyster omelette and a lime juice for just 7 dollars
1
The last time I was here was a few years ago and has good memories of their food taste.This time, it's just disappointing!Taste is no longer the same and portion is miserably small!Chilli prawn- don't be fooled by menu picture, for $12 it has just 6 miserable shrimps! It's not even a prawn! Really small shrimp!Avocado drink- $6 with very small glass, almost 2 gulps you can finish!Tauhu telor - very oily Fried chicken - the worst of all, very dry n overlooked u can't bite the tough meat off!Will never go back again
5
I was impressed by the food at Tambuah Mas. The meals are not only tasty, but also very creative in their usage of ingredients. And for what it is, the value is very good. Highly recommended.
5
The heart of the restaurant in Singapore. Soooon I will be back there. The best food and best staff ever!
5
My favourite indonesian restaurant . Good service too. Recommended must try food: Tahur Telok, Beef Redang and the deep fried baby squid. Delicious.
5
Since 1987, I've been buying Tambuah Mas' curry puffs & I must confirm that they are absolutely the best I've tasted in S'pore! Firstly, it's generous in size & portion, not a 3 bite CP. The crust is light yet doesn't crumble to pieces when one bites into it. The filling.... Yumssss!, is generous too; just the right amount of spiciness in its sambal (I think this recipe uses more sambal than curry powder) & a proper slice of egg. It's shiokadoo from first to last bite. It won't disappoint you, EVER!Was at the restaurant last Thurs & Julius, the Restaurant Manager, very kindly asked the kitchen to fry up some for me to take home although it was their break time. Thanks, Julius! Ordered their signature Tahu Telor which didn't disappoint. The Ikan Pepes was fab too. Oh, I loved loved their satay - you must order that. Nasi Goreng was delicious too. I ordered for the non spicy version for my kids. This restaurant is an oldie but still a goodie!
4
Visited Tambuah Mas several times over the years, and it never disappoints. While the food is not exceptional, it is very good, offering all the basic dishes of Indonesian cuisine. The clientele is mostly Indonesian, which says a lot about the authenticity of the food. The service is OK, and the setting is casual and relaxed
5
On my first visit to Singapore my husband and I visited this fantastic restaurant. My husband has been living in Singapore in 7 years, and he always talk about this Indonesian restaurant - and when we visited Singapore together, we had to dine her. We went there two times in one week, and he was right - it is very good food, I love it. Longing back - and hope we'll be in Singapore soon
4
Been eating @ Tambuah Mas since they were in my office building, Shaw Centre, back in the late 90's to early 00's. Since then at their Tanglin Rd (ie north-end Orchard Rd location) but as of a visit within the last year, still very tasty food and somewhere I frequent every time I'm back in SG. I dig everything on the menu, but for me staples are, of course a Rendang & Tahu Talor, but then whatever else I'm in the mood for :) From eating Indonesian food all over the island, including holes in the wall over the place, I still go back to Tambuah Mas :)Yummm Indonesian food, and always an experience in that location
3
 We only realized our beef rendang was missing when we got home. Upon calling to inform them the person on the phone was quick to blame someone else. In my heavily pregnant state I went back just to collect it again another person there said it wasn't her who forgoq I think collectively the restaurant is responsible and they should have offered compensation for my having to travel back there as well as having to call them to complain abt my missing order. It was a family meal at home for a special occasion-CNY.
4
This Indonesian restaurant is on the top floor of the Tanglin Shopping Centre so you have to know its there as you just won't stumble on it. But the food is extremely fresh and tasty. You certainly won't complain about the price of the food. Incredibly cheap. The Gado Gado was excellent, as were also the fish options as well. We ate here on a couple of occasions and both times the food was great. Service was good
4
Not a top location on the 4th floor of Tanglin Sopping Center, but still happy to go here again, because the whole family has at least one favourite dish in this traditional restaurant: rendang, satay, nasi istimewa, etc., everything tastes great. Feels like comfort food. The only danger is that you might eat too much... Friendly service, fair priced menu, nothing to complain about. We'll come again. And again
5
the rendang is very good. Tambuah Mas is in the basement of the up market paragon shopping centre.must try thier tahu telur and limak aoiam . the service is good
4
Like previous reviewers said, the Rendang is very good. Nasi goreng is good too and is served with 2 pieces of satay?
This restaurant is located in the basement of the paragon shopping centre
3
This restaurant is cosy and relaxing, must try their tahu telur and their lemak ayam. The portion is just nice for two person and services is good.The steam rice is very delicious , for dessert i will recommend chendol.
1
I was at the Tanglin Mall outlet. This is obe of the 'Must Go' restaurant when I have guest in town. However I have not been there for about a year. Most familiar faces staff were no longer there. But what most disappointment was not only the service levelnhas dropped but the quality of food sucks. The fried squids which used to be my favourite tasted like peanut with soya sauce. I thought it was a one time off... but today my craving of having its famous tahu telor brings me to a conclusion. Service really sucks and I guess they are no longer interested putting up good food. I ordered a take away and was advise to take a seat. I told the gentleman in black uniform(whom later identified as a manager) that I shall wait by the side of its main entrance. After waiting almost 15 minutes, I decided to check if its ready. The cashier told me it has been there for almost 10 mins. I approached the manager asking what happened as he was supposed to hand it to me. Casually he said he's too busy and forgot about it. Well the restaurant has only about 9 guest in 3 tables.... that's ALOT to him. Its not so much of the 15 minutes waiting but the attitude of the service staff which conclude that it will be the last time I'm patronising this restaurant.
2
Went with a client on Friday Night and found the service had dropped significantly.The waitress upon showing us our table, immediately took one of the chairs and placed it at another table. I found her mannerism to be rude. Even fast food restaurants will ask you first if they wanted to take away one of the chairs at your table. Upon confrontation, she said "OK, it's not a big issue". The ironic thing was that, the other table did not require the additional chair and later on she placed it back at our table without an apology. The good thing was that she avoided our table after the confrontation and we were served by a slightly pleasant waiter for the rest of the night. Thou the initial greeting had left us with a sour note.The tahu telor may be too die for but i'll say this for sure, the services are not.With that, i'll conclude that last friday will be the last time I'm eating at this restaurant. I'll rather go to other "to die for" establishement with better services
4
Ate at Tambuah Mas in Tanglin Shopping Centre (I believe the restaurant at Paragon is a branch) with a group of 10 friends.The food was tasty, especially the satay, tahu telor, beef rendang and oxtail soup, and the prices are reasonable. The restaurant was not crowded - probably because it was Monday evening - and service was commendable.This restaurant has been around for many years and has managed to maintain a consistently high standard throughout. Not a "must try" but certainly a good choice if you want tasty and reasonably priced Indonesian food
4
We went to Tambuah Mas (Paragon) as a family of four. We were served promptly and staff were friendly. The deco and layout was nice. Noise level was at a minimum (not many kids around and if there is any, they were well behaved). We had a couple of dishes but the most memorable and worth mentioning was their Beef Rendang, Tahu Telur and Ox Tail soup. The soup was simply delicious and the Tahu Telur and Beef Rendang is to die for. We also tried the Ayam Goreng Istimewa. Well, i can only say that there is nothing special about that dish (Istimewa is Indonesian for Special). I find the chicken too tough and the spices made it dry. Overall, it's a great indonesian restaurant
5
There are actually two of these restaurants in Singapore and this review is regarding the one located on the fourth floor of the Tanglin Plaza (not the one in the Paragon Shopping Centre). Ate at this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon and we were the only westerners in there at the time (always a good sign to see locals eating there!). The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had the Beef Rendang, Nasi Goreng, Chicken Satays (had to get more they were so nice) and Ox Tail soup. All were perfect and I must say I've never had a better Rendang! Food was brought out to us promptly and the restaurant was very clean. Even with five of us it was a very cheap meal and value for money. I would certainly go there again. Yum! (On a side note, the Tanglin Plaza looks deserted on the weekend, but there is this restaurant and a chinese one on the fourth floor - great if you don't want to wait in line for a table at one of the busier malls/centres
4
We were after a "sate/satay fix" and after a quick google search scribbled down the addresses of a few close to where we were. We weren't disappointed but it's own web-site makes Tambuah Mas look a little more sophisticated than it actually is. It is in the basement of the up-market Paragon shopping Centre and part of food court filled with other mid-market restaurant chains like Din Tai Fung. The menu is not large which is probably a good thing and everything we order was great. Satay satisfied our craving, spicy prawns (Udang Belado) sweet at first but with a good spicy finish, beef rendang really good too. Service was friendly and efficient and prices reasonable. Would I go back there, absolutely, but maybe only after trying the other 100 equally good alternatives
3
This is not a bad restaurant but I've certainly had better. To give them credit, their beef rendang was excellent (tender, spiced just right, not too salty) and their signature dish, Tahu Telor (fried soya curd and egg) was tasty and original. The portion sizes, ambience and service were good, but the rest of the dishes were lack lustre. The fried chicken was dry, hard and tasteless; the chicken sate was not tender and lacked taste (under-marinated). I enjoyed the fried baby squid (but I always like this unless it's not crispy) - but it was just about average... 10 of us dined there that night and whilst noone thought it awful, we all left slightly disappointed, as a restaurant in such a location should be able to dish up better fare
