This is a cute little restaurant in the hotel that provide breakfast to the guests and there is a delicious Indian menu for dinner.
It is nothing special. Except it is Raffles Singapore so don't miss it and go for tea!
4
Lovely ambience with great customer service received! Too bad that the place is under restoration and I cannot wait to visit there again!
3
Overall a nice buffet of Indian food, but I was expecting some more traditional or unusual dishes that I hadn't seen before. Overall very nice, just not anything exceptional.
5
Even tho the price for high tea is little pricy compared to other hotels, it's definitely worth it! My mom and sister really enjoyed it.
***Tip: reservation is required!!!
5
A trip to Raffles is an essential part of any holiday to Singapore. The afternoon tea in the Tiffin room was beautiful and the service was first rate.
5
Have a curry tiffin in this gracious old room, waited on by smiling and attentive staff. Plenty of food, curries of every type, all with ingredients listed so you can avoid the things you dont like and focus on the ones you do. Three courses of as much as you can eat. Drinks are pricey but the wine list is extensive and there is sure to be something you can afford. Don't come to Raffles for cheap eats
5
We visited the Tiffin room with friends from Belgium, the buffet was really outstanding. The service and attention to our every request fantastic. One of the best Northern Indian meals we've enjoyed anywhere. The setting is also great, takes you back a 100 years or more
5
I booked this on the recommendation of a friend. Our whole holiday was to celebrate our 5th Wedding Anniversary and what a way to do this, at Raffles and with Afternoon Tea! Easy online booking tool, excellent availability choice and good communication. Service, selection and ambiance was everything and more! You can choose to add a glass/bottle of champagne or opt for a traditional Singapore Sling. These are at an extra cost and will get added to your bill at the end. Don't just go to the bar for a Singapore Sling, do it in style with Afternoon Tea! You will not be disappointed!
5
What is there to say other than this was magical, the whole afternoon is a well planned affair, the ambience, the afternoon sweets and buffet together with the first rate service, this is not something to be missed. Everything was first class standard, well done!Make sure you are dressed appropriately as you will be questioned and may not get in, follow the dress codes that is part of what makes this afternoon so special
5
Staying in Singapore had to visit the institution that is Raffles for afternoon tea. Easy access via MRT Esplanade or City Hall stations. The service and food was impeccable. Finger sandwiches, cakes, scones, a wide range of teas and also a good variety of buffet items as well. Everything you would expect from this hotel given its (thoroughly deserved) reputation. A must do whilst in Singapore
4
It was a splendid experience with Tiffin room for afternoon tea. You will definitely enjoy your time with your girlfriends or loved ones there. Definitely worth a visit before they close for restoration
5
There wasn't a large range of food on offer which was in no way bad as what was there was fabulous and was in keeping with the quality of Raffles overall. Everything was fresh and well presented with excellent service.
4
Went for the evening buffet. Good service, good buffet, great drinks. All in a historic hotel setting your grandparents aspired to.
2
the meat dishes were very stiff.complainmed that the meat dishes need to be cooked a little longer as undercooked.just ate the cheese naan to fill up the stomachs.
5
Visited the Tiffen Room to celebrate the delivery of a very successful business partnership. The setting was stunning, the service impeccable and the Indian buffet simply delicious. Certainly the kind of place for a special occasion.
4
An enjoyable High tea experience in a majestic setting. Service was good, only minor complaint was that the sandwich bread could have been fresher.
5
Took my team here for farewell lunch and early christmas gathering. Second time i have been here and it certainly lived up to our expectations. The buffet selection is wonderful and make sure to leave room for desert. Great place to savour the luxury of raffles and soak in the atmosphere
3
Worth the visit for the ambience and the history. In a beautifully restored part of this historic hotel we enjoyed our high tea for the history and the presentation. Food was plentiful, varied colourful and tasty. Scones were ' interesting' and the Bread & Butter pudding ' different' but it was an experience where one could say......"Had high tea at Raffles
1
My wife and I visited Raffles for afternoon tea and sadly what a disappointment it turned out to be. If you are going to set rules and regulations on dress codes please follow them to start as it makes for a bad impression when you find you have followed the rules but most others have not. As regards queuing up in the walkway not really becoming of a hotel of your stature really presents as a money rolling gimic. Now for the afternoon tea itself why do staff spend the first five minutes flogging you champagne at a "reduced price for today" please!The food was easy three star material and the last time I had bread and butter pudding was fifty years ago as primary school. It took so long to clear the plates I had to ask for this to be done in the end, and tea leaves without a strainer for tea.This experience while costly I would warn other travellers off it's not worth the money you can walk around the building and enjoy the scenery.Miss by a mile unless you enjoy a Singapore Sling which is why you should come here in the first place
5
There for my wife's 50th birthday. The surroundings were elegance personified. The staff were ultra helpful and even gave us a complimentary birthday cake. This really is the Gold Standard of afternoon tea and if you are a fan of this ritual then some time in your life do this
5
The Raffles Afternoon tea, served in the Tiffin Room, was lovely and well worth a visit. My top tip, to avoid having to queue in the sweltering heat is to arrive 15 minutes after the official start time.
5
Buffet spread was good. Even had a complimentary birthday cake (small) to celebrate a guest's birthday and the staff sang for us.
4
Whenever we visit Singapore we make a stop at Raffles to have a curry evening in their Tiffin room and it never disappoints. My one complaint, although you can't really call it that is there is so much to choose from and no way can you sample everything on offer. As always it was a fantastic meal at a fantastic restaurant situated in a fantastic hotel. Thank you for making our evening so memorable
5
Visited for our second night in Singapore and we were very impressed with the quality of the food and the service at this hotel/restaurant.We went for the curry buffet which did not disappoint.From the amazing tasty starters to the selection of main courses (veg, meat and fish) along with the chef special dishes bought to your table by the waiters, all of the food was excellent.Wine list was excellent as well as was the service from the staff.This place is a must while you are in Singapore
5
We booked for the English High Tea in the Tiffin Room and were not disappointed. The food on offer was fresh, delicious and plentiful. We loved the ambience created by the harp player. We had made a mistake and had a light lunch before attending afternoon tea - mistake! There were so many tasty treats on offer, there was no need to eat before hand. The afternoon was just lovely and now a very special memory
2
Visited for high tea on Saturday, whilst i was aware it is a little expensive i was okay with it as i wanted the whole experience thing,however i must say at the end of it i was feeling let down with it all, and would certainly not waste my time going again or recommending to other people to have high tea
3
Visiting from Australia. Decided to have a "high tea" purely to say that we had been there and thought that we couldn't go wrong on such an occasion. Patrons squeezed into a restaurant situation. Grossly overpriced, food less than average, service not good. In all, an absolute disappointment.
5
We were lucky enough to stay in Raffles hotel overnight and had dinner in the Tiffin Room that night. The evening meal is buffet style Indian cuisine and was very enjoyable. There were many dishes to choose from and there were descriptions of the various dishes, so you knew what they were before helping yourself, which was very good if you don't like food that is too spicy. Whilst it was a buffet style meal, there were waiting staff around to help you with choosing your food and they would bring special dishes and accompaniments to the table, as well as drinks. The food was varied, well cooked and very enjoyable. The service was excellent, as expected from a restaurant in Raffles Hotel.Having stayed overnight, breakfast the following morning was also in the Tiffin Room. The breakfast comprised of ordering freshly prepared food from the menu, whilst having a buffet style table for cereals, etc. Freshly squeezed fruit juice was brought to the table and was topped up if necessary. The waiting staff were the same staff from the previous evening and the service was again very good. The breakfast was very tasty, especially being freshly cooked.We also managed to fit in afternoon tea at Raffles, again in the Tiffin Room. The afternoon tea had both a buffet section for some more traditional Asian dishes, as well as sandwiches, scones and cakes brought to the table. The food was fresh and very tasty and there was plenty to fill us up.The hotel does have other restaurants, but the Tiffin Room is a good size to accommodate breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner, whilst offering different types of cuisine. All three were very enjoyable and the service excellent on all occasions
5
I had booked us in for the North Indian Curry Buffet in the Tiffin Room as a surprise on our wedding anniversary and we enjoyed one of the most wonderful meals during our time in Singapore.We were greeted by my first name on arrival in a warm,friendly way and shown to our table which overlooked the illuminated fountain in the courtyard outside. The extensive buffet was explained to us then our waiter,Sanjay,(apologies if I have misspelt your name) took our drinks order and took very good care of us for the rest of the evening.The food was delicious with plenty of choice from the starters/salads to the meat and vegetarian main dishes. Additionally, signature dishes fresh from the kitchen were served directly to our table by another waiter. There was a wide choice of desserts although by this time we didn't have much room left.The Tiffin room itself is evocative of another age,reminiscent of the raj and beautifully decorated. It was a shame that there were many empty tables almost as though the curry buffet is not particularly well known.At the end of the meal we had a lovely surprise when Sanjay presented us with a cake for our anniversary which we took back to our nearby hotel and devoured later,it was delicious.The meal and our drinks, a couple of glasses of champagne and a bottle of red wine were of course expensive but this was the Raffles experience and I would not have missed it for the world. We thoroughly enjoyed our special occasion and I would highly recommend the curry buffet
5
Just returned from Singapore. We went to Raffles for afternoon tea. I have coeliac disease. We pre booked well in advanced The three other members of my party had a wonderful afternoon tea. Mine was very disappointing The bread was hard. Cakes or tiny buns you couldn't describe them as cakes, had a very poor taste and I couldn't eat them. The scones well definitely not scones!! Such a shame
4
Singapore sling drink was over priced.good buffet variety over all.lots of different meats and other appetizers in both veg n non veg.
4
If your in Singapore ask yourself if you can really afford to go here as it's expensive then ask yourself if you can really afford to miss it , then book it and enjoy it.
5
We had arranged to have breakfast at Raffles for my mums Birthday, even though we were staying across the road. It had been on her bucket list. We weren't disappointed - breakfast was fantastic and the service was first class.
5
A mixture of sweet and savoury delicacies, including hot and cold food. A selection of Asian, European and 'fusion' dishes.
5
What a lovely step back in time to have high tea in this beautiful building place. The food was fresh and well presented and ample in portions. There is a lovely eastern style high tea also so no chance you will leave wanting more. A must do if you are in Singapore. Good idea to book which you can do online
5
Tiffins at Raffles hotel is a fine dining Indian place. It is up there with the few, other best Indian restaurants ln Singapore. The setting is the old majestic, colonial style of Raffles. If this was India, you would think you were in the Raj days. The food is served buffet style and I was very pleased they had a large veggie section with all the classics. I was also very happy with the hara bhara kabab. Service was superior. Price is also on the upper side like in any of the superior dining places in Singapore. But justifiably so. Dress code is business casual. The chef came to check several times whether everything was as it should be. He was not hiding behind his buffet but took visible pride in his work. Definitely a place to have to go to.
1
Waiters running around like mad.Never served us water. Never refilled my herbal tea. Couldn't get their attention.Dim Sum gummy and tastelessBoring hot items - not worth the caloriesExpensive priced wine at $65 per bottle, but cheap tasting.-- they served us hangover wine- couldn't swallow it. Sommelier needs to go back to school. BUT, the finger sandwiches were greatTo boot - after waiting nearly 20 min for a taxi with 2 elderly people in tow, the bell staff let the taxi refuse to take us -- because we were going 4 blocks. So we had to wait for another taxi, which thankfully came quickly because at least the bell staff started calling for taxi's. The taxi's should not be dictating if they answer a call from Raffles - Raffles should have stood up for its customers and said to take us or leave.Bottom line: they are milking the tourist trap that is Raffles and not offering quality, just expensive. Instead try tea at the Fullerton or somewhere else. Skip this rip off
5
The Tiffin Room is a classic restaurant in the Raffles hotel. I ate here for the North Indian Buffet, and it blew my mind! I am not a huge fan of Indian fare, but this completely captured my taste buds. The quality and variety of dishes was out of this world! Not to forget the service was excellent. They were attentive, friendly and efficient.A fantastic place to go with friends and family, or even by yourself (as I did) to enjoy the experience
5
High tea in the Tiffin Room at Raffles hotel is an absolute must-do when visiting Singapore. Its not cheap, but its one of those things ticked off my bucket list.The setting is old colonial and so tasteful and I felt transported back to another time.The food was impeccable. Unfortunately our tea order was forgotten and when it did arrive it was not what we'd ordered. So we did not have a drink until we had finished our savoury food from the buffet. The service recovery kicked in and our waiter did everything possible (and more) to put it right. It didn't spoil our enjoyment of the afternoon and the result was we left happy and we look forward to visiting again
5
A friend recommended we book afternoon tea at Raffles during our stop over in Singapore. I'm very glad we took his advise as this was the highlight of our visit.From the beautiful room and table setting and the harp music played throughout. The food and service were impeccable and the athmosphere as you would imagine in an historic colonial hotel.It isn't something to do if you are on a budget as especially if you have champagne or a Singapore Sling it is quite expensive but as they say you get what you pay for and we came away feeling it was well worth it.Make sure you read the dress code as you will not be allowed in if not dressed appropriately
4
Best high tea i have experienced.
Beautiful food with a lovely calm atmosphere.
I would recommend you book on a sunday as it gets pretty busy.
5
Delicious food, excellent service and genuine personal touch for my small afternoon tea wedding reception. Such beautiful decor and atmosphere. Special thanks to Kaylynn,Amos,Joshua,Vanessa and Rose.
5
Always a hit with our overseas guests when we bring them here for dinner. Service is impeccable, ambience is classy, food is good. Taking a walk around the compound before dinner was also a nice touch.
5
A vast array of fresh, tasty foods to chose from, each more delicious than the last! From the numerous chutneys and salads, through the main dishes, the naan & poppadoms, to the lovely selection of desserts, all were perfectly prepared & presented. The setting is old colonial and very tasteful and decorated with beautiful displays of orchids. The food was laid out with the main dishes in front of a cabinet displaying antique tiffin containers, which I personally found very interesting. The service was impeccable, the staff were very attentive but not so much so that you felt uncomfortable, they got it just right. The restaurant was far from full when we visited, people just don't know what they are missing
5
The staff were friendly and efficient, the place is picturesque and the food beautiful. You get the usual three tiered sandwich and dessert service but you can also access a buffet which has a range of food from curry pasties through to scones and even hot pud should you want it. It also has a variety of Asian food. I know it is a bit expensive but if I was back in Singapore I would want to go again. Singapore was just a break in our flight to Australia but things like this afternoon tea made it very much one of the stars of the holiday
3
My partner and I were so excited to be experiencing a high tea at the Raffles Tiffin room but unfortunately we're dispointed upon our arrival. The glitz and glamour which we thought may have come with the historical place wasn't to be. Dressed up we arrived to a disorganized chaos of where to go. No signage where to go and we were then lined up in a tourist group which we weren't suppose to be in. Yes the Indian gard/ doorman looked great in his historical uniform of the time didn't seem friendlly. Finally after waiting in the chaos out in the heat we were invited inside the tiffin room . Squeezed in to close tables greeted us with a lovely three tier stand of assortments along with a buffet. Don't get me wrong the food was great but no atmospher inside the tiffin room. I would of thought they may have had historical photos inside but nothing at all. Just the plain walks with high ceilings. Raffles staff over looked us but seemed stressed . Overall even though pricey the food is well provided just no real atmosphere. Left disappointed with difficulty gaining a taxi as no real care factor by raffles doorme
4
We had a very nice afternoon tea in the tiffin room, I asked for the gluten free option, they made everything especially for me, and my husband enjoyed the dim sum that was on offer too. The service was great and it was a lovely way to spend our last afternoon in Singapore
4
I can understand some of the less positive reviews if your expectations are really high. You have to remember you are paying for the ambience of the silver service and harp player! The sandwiches were traditional high tea (cucumber / salmon / etc) with a selection of small cakes. The addition of the dim sums was great, we are in Singapore after all! Scones were light and tasty with good quality cream. We had champagne and then tea with our scones. A Singapore sling was also consumed before we left. We sat down at 3pm and left at 5.20pm, there was no feeling that they were rushing you to leave and were offering more sandwiches if we wanted. Not a cheap high tea but we enjoyed it.
4
We visited the hotel because it was always our wish to experience a 'Sling' at its Singapore home, where it was created.Unfortunately for us, both the Long Bar and Billiards room were undergoing renovation, which meant that we had to use the Tea Room for our cocktail experience. Service was slow (had to queue for 20 minutes) and the cocktails were very pricey!Somewhat disappointing, but still worth a visit
5
If the the proof of the pudding is really in the eating then the nightly Indian buffet must score highly.If you require more then you will certainly get it from the impeccable service of the charming, attentive staff.The range of mouthwatering dishes is excellent all set out in an attractive and appealing manner.You cannot visit Raffles Hotel and not sample the delights of the Tiffin Room - which also serves breakfast and afternoon tea
4
...with super service (but I admit I'm a regular, which makes a difference!). The food is good but not very original or creative.
5
A must do if you have the chance
Need to book in advance but can be done easily before you travel
Great experience
4
We went for buffet lunch to the Tiffin Room; it's one of my favourite spots to take friends visiting Singapore. The layout of the food, the attention to details, staffs' attentiveness, the flavours are all impeccable. Totally lives up to the Raffles standards!
4
A visit to the Tiffin Room for a curry buffet is part of the whole Raffles experience but don't expect an authentic ethnic Indian experience because it has been watered down to suit the slightly less exposed palates. Service is excellent and this historic setting does lend itself to an air of sophistication and nostalgia. It would not be out of place at the Ritz in London or somewhere of that kind. Reservations are a must and dress codes are required, but be prepared for disruption now that the renovations have started
3
Our preferred dining option when we are in Singapore is the buffet in the Billiards Room but sadly that is currently unavailable because of hotel renovations. We rate the international buffet in the Billiards room as probably one of the best we have ever experienced nevertheless we decided to give The Tiffin Room Indian buffet a go. Yes, the food was good but lacking in variation and choice. Very little by way of seafood and if I am honest no better than a decent curry restaurant. I just didn't get a fusion of spices and contrasting tastes. When choosing a buffet I guess you don't expect too much service but when we paid £50+ for a very ordinary Sauvignon Blanc I do expect it to be served throughout the meal! The waiter poured the first glass but we never saw him again! Not the end of the world but it is awkward stretching over the table whilst sat down every time you top up. Sorry but that is poor for an ordinary establishment but extremely disappointing for Raffles with their reputation. What was meant to be a highlight in Singapore for my wife's birthday turned out to be a low light. Beautiful restaurant with a really nice ambiance but the cuisine and service don't match. For the £170 we paid for the buffet for two with a very ordinary bottle of wine we could have got a much better experience elsewhere
4
Having dined at the Indian Buffet during our last visit, my wife and I were keen to return. The room looked lovely and service was as to be expected at a hotel of this standard, although "It is a pleasure to serve you, sir" was somewhat unnecessary. Something happened to the Buffet since our visit. Whilst the food was nicely displayed and plentiful, many of the curries had no distinctive taste. The Rogan Josh was the standout and one of the best we have eaten. Both fish dishes were rather ordinary and we have eaten tastier meals at our local Indian restaurant. Desserts were nice but not spectacular.Alcohol prices are high in Singapore and the Tiffin's were no exception although I was disappointed at the charge of $12 for a medium size bottle of water. If you have not been to the Tiffin Room, and are happy to settle for just better than average food, make the trip. On our last night we dined at Curry Culture and found the food excellent
5
We decided that we couldn't visit Singapore without doing Raffles, so we went for afternoon tea and Singapore slings in the Tiffin Room. We expected it to be expensive, and it was at $200Singapore. In addition to the afternoon tea stand, there was a choice of buffet items, both savoury and dessert. More of a full meal than just an afternoon tea. Plenty of staff around, and the service was immaculate. Beware that the hotel is undergoing some considerable building work at the moment but this did not impinge on the Tiffen Room experience
2
I was anxious about going here..worried that my expectations of fine colonial grandeur wouldn't be met. I was right. It was just "ok" - a lovely room, nice enough scones and sandwiches, reasonable tea. But don't expect a traditional English afternoon tea. This is Singaporean style. It's different though not in a good way. Two things definitely do not go with afternoon tea: 1. Queuing. This doesn't feel right!! Reserve a table for 3:15 or 3:30 so you don't have to queue; 2. A Dim Sum buffet. Dim sum is very nice, Dim Sum Singaporean style is even nicer, but dim sum with scones and clotted cream is confusing. Lastly, the staff are nice but lack training, and there are too few of them. More staff, fewer tables, a greater tea selection, and quieter music would be a good start
5
Visited for the Buffet Curry Night, warm welcome through the main Hotel entrance.Very grand, and made to feel special even though we were dining not residing at the Hotel.Buffet was not particularly extensive, but food was good quality as you would expect, for us it was worth the cost for the Raffles Experience. If you travel with Singapore Airlines, show your boarding card to receive a 20% Discount off the full bill.Restaurant gave me a complimentary birthday cake, which was much appreciated
3
Nice surroundings, but overall a slightly disappointing experience. You aren't allowed to go through the main entrance to the hotel, rather round to the side. You have to book in advance, which is expected. I didn't expect to have to queue up outside for 20 minutes before being shown to my table.There was even a queue to go to the bar for a drink prior. The waiting in a queue gave the experience a demeaning tourist attraction feel.The tea however, to a British person, was bordering on offensive. So weak, and no loose leaf in the pot.Thankfully the cream with the scones was at least clotted.This isn't a traditional afternoon tea, and if you are looking for an experience like The Savoy or Claridges you'll be disappointed. For the price the quality was ok, but I think they are dining out on the Raffles name and tradition and should be wary of prioritising affordability to the detriment of qualityI wouldn't really recommend to friends to visit. I'm sure you can have equal or better experience in another hotel
5
Good food, Nice Ambience and most importantly good service... Desserts are the high light. Value for all these.
5
Serves a wonderful Breakfast each morning and at Tea in the afternoon they specialise on English Tea, Scones, Sandwiches and Cakes...superb!
In the evening try the Tiffin Room for a Curry, the best south of Mumbai!
Service always great.
5
I loved my visit to the Tiffin Room and intend to return over and over again. Such old world class and sophistication, something I love. What a great opportunity to dress up a little and simply soak up the classy atmosphere.
5
The Curry Buffet in the Tiffin Room of the famous Raffles Hotel in Singapore is for those who love Indian food an excellent dining experience. Check beforehand as to dress code and times of the buffet. This is a truly exceptional dining experience. Don't leave Singapore without stopping here unless you hate curry. This is like traveling back in time to the days when the British Empire still existed. Absolutely fantastic. This is not inexpensive
5
Although The Raffles is currently undergoing renovation, the Tiffin Room curry buffet is still a regular feature. My husband and I dined with another couple and were delighted by the vast choice of dishes available. The service was excellent with well dressed staff catering for our every need. The buffet was separated into appetisers, main course and dessert. In addition, staff brought "chef's recommendations" such as tandoori chicken and paneer to our table. The also brought an impressive selection of naan bread. My husband doesn't eat meat and was very happy with the wide choice of vegetarian dishes.The Tiffin Room is an elegant space reflecting the Raffles grandeur and I would thoroughly recommend it if visiting Singapore
5
Went for my husbands 70th Birthday, had the curry buffet, Service was nothing short of excellent, food fabulous. The famous Singapore Sling was good even though I didn't think there was alcohol in it (lol). the servers came out with a cake and candle, sung happy birthday to Hubby, was fantastic. was slightly stunned with the bill ($64 for the 2 S/Slings for a start).. but wouldn't change a thing. loved every bit of it
1
The food here is very poor. I think the poorest quality Indian food that I have had for many years in Singapore or elsewhere. The buffet selection was small and the dishes for the most part very bland and lacking in personality. Perhaps sanitised for the international guests. The puddings were astonishingly poor. The cheesecake had a sticky and odd consistency with an impenetrable base. The ice cream appalling. Quite an exceptionally bad experience. The location is great and the service attentive.
5
We recently went for dinner for the North Indian buffet. The selection of curries and condiments were vast and the quality was excellent. The buffet signs indicated gluten free which was so refreshing to see. There were also a number of chef specials that could be served directly to the table. The restaurant was very busy being a Sunday but still had a nice atmosphere
5
White table cloths, silverware, white jackets, clinching of crystal and china and all the details one would expect when having tea or lunch at an English estate back in the early 1900's. The restaurant oozes charm and nostalgia. The service is immaculate as one would expect from Raffles. Breakfast is also served here every morning for those staying in the hotel which we were and so were fortunate enough to enjoy the Tiffin Room every day of our stay
1
Went to Tiffin room because Royal China was preparing for renovation. The servant told us the room was full so that they cannot serve us. We were then lead to the restaurant and it was almost empty with only a few tables of Caucasians. Having seen the empty restaurant, they changed their excuse to the dress code. We felt that we were not served because we somehow don't meet the standard of the servant, maybe because of our skin color. We are not going back to restaurant because there is obvious discrimination
5
My family and I stayed at the Raffles Hotel over the weekend. Our booking came with breakfast. We totally enjoyed our breakfast at The Tiffin Room. The staff were very nice and gave good, attentive service. My daughter enjoyed her pancakes very much.
5
Amazing amazing amazing. This is by far the best place I've ever been for afternoon tea. Fantastic service, and amazing food. I can recommend enough.
5
A must for anyone who visits Singapour must book in advance to get a table.The scones are extremely good never ending supply of coffee.
3
A visit to Singapore wouldn't be complete without a visit to the famous Raffles Hotel.Firstly we went to the Long Bar to enjoy a Singapore Sling which indeed was up to expectation. Following day we visited for afternoon tea which we booked (and you do need to book) 4 days prior. Dressed for the occasion we were slightly disappointed that we weren't allowed in through the front door of the hotel but was directed to a side entrance and had to queue for 15 mins even tho we had a reservation.The room was a grand tearoom, tables presented well, crisp white table cloths and napkins. A cake-stand with a small selection was placed on the table and we thought that was all we were going to get. However on looking around the room we spotted a buffet at the far end which we presumed we were meant to select from as well. No introduction, information card on table or welcome from any staff member was given and we were left to assume that we were to go to the buffet ourselves. We did ask a staff member and he replied 'yes' walked off and shrugged his shoulders!!The selection of food on the buffet was excellent, hot and cold items including steamed dumplings and sauces, fresh fruits, scones, iced teas etc oh and bread and butter pudding if there was any room left. Combined with what was included on the cake stand on our table and ample piping hot fresh leaf tea, all exceeded expectation in both quality and quantity.Harpist played for most of the time we were there made the whole occasion a good experience.We paid over Â£80 for two and our only criticism would be that perhaps because it's so popular they go about it as a routine forgetting that their guests are looking for a special experience - complacency I suppose. As a guest we also had to go outside for toilets, took 15 mins as a queue with visitors in the hotel grounds/bar as we not allowed to use main hotel ones! Overall though pretty good, just needs a personality to lead it. It would have been nice to have a full Raffles Hotel experience and not feel one was paying to go in the back door. That does not happen at The Ritz or Savoy in London. Would not recommend others as a better experience can be got elsewhere
5
We had the dinner buffet. Good variety of dishes & staff were very helpful to explain each dish & point out the vegetarian dishes to our vegan guest. Value for money but be prepared for a slow dinner as wise to have small portions & try as much variety as you ca
3
First time we've attended High Tea and I was a pretty disappointed. Gluten free tasted like it was prepackaged (still yummy, but not home-made) The harpist made this afternoon, the ambiance was beautiful because of her.Service staff constantly telling us that they'd be with us soon. Or a colleague would help in a minute. Dinner set/cutlery/etc was pretty knackered and old- for the price it doesn't deserve the pomp that surrounds this place.
2
Nothing Grand Left of this old LadyWhen you have an image of a place that you have had for many years I think the disappointment is greater because you have an expectation.I know it's closing down In parts for renovation, but I found the whole place commercialised without any ambiance over priced living on its reputation .The place looked unkempt with dozens of people walking through dressed in all sorts of attiredNothing grand left about it. The Tiffin room over crowded, tea was basic as to what was served buffet was poor.Just too loud due to the amount of people. I then saw some one trying to eat a scone with a knife and folk cutting cross ways from the top spreading cream in top of it I was so tempted to mention it, so that she could enjoy the rest of it, by at least splitting the way it should be.When I made my way up to the long bar, real poor show, loads of scruffily dressed people waiting to go in forming a tourist Q.Didn't bother to go in.No would not recommend and certainly will not go agai

Lovely setting and environment however the High Tea was very disappointing. Menu consisted of very plain sandwiches with no special attention to fillings. These could be made at home. English cakes were average, nothing to rave about. No high end patisserie cakes. Buffet consisted of dim sims and dumpling that were hard. Savoury buffet items consisted of only chicken curry puffs and croque monsieur (basic toasted cheese). Scones and fresh fruit were offered as part of the buffet too. Staff however were lovely and attentive. All in all, expected more from Raffles Hotel and they should of included a classier menu with lovely fillings and decadence. Would not recommend at all, would of been happy to pay the price we paid if the food was up to expectation - S$145.00 for 2 people, without any alcohol. The Fullerton Hotel puts Raffles to shame with their High Tea

Raffles Hotel is lovely, as was the Tiffin Room.Unfortunately our waiter provided us with very poor service, and had to be prompted for everything (when located), and this marred my opinion.The High Tea experience is expensive, and the food was merely average.I'm glad I went "to have an opinion" and to see Raffles, but I will not be returning for High Tea or recommending

A great place to dine with family and friends amidst the colonial setting. The full setup inside the famed Raffles hotel is undoubtedly reminds us of British India. Large dining room with high ceiling with matching antique style furnitures. Interior decoration of the dining hall is par excellence. The food itself is delicious but although may not be the best in Singapore, the ambience makes Tiffin room a perfect place to spend the afternoon. Good selection of north and South Indian delicacies are neatly arranged in buffet style. Service is impeccable. And yes, do keep some space for the dessert. It is a huge selection of Indian sweets such as rasmalai, gulab jamun and rosogollas, also cakes and pastries. Special mention of kulfi or traditional Indian ice cream, which is not to be misse
5
I am not a curry eater but for those of our party who are, they just loved it. A huge variety. Beautifully served in a lovely room. A la carte delicious and varied too.
5
One word...Incredible!
A must to experience the ambience and superb service! See and be seen :)
The dim sum buffet was hot and fresh and high tea sandwiches were scrumptious.
Definitely a re-do for their well known Indian lunch/dinner buffet.
5
The Indian buffet in the Tiffin Room is excellent. Probably one of the best Indian meals I have ever tasted... Tasty food in beautiful colonial surroundings...

We were a party of 3 visiting from the UKAlthough they say they operate a strict dress code this is only applied in some cases. There were ladies with scruffy trainers on. One lady had a swimming costume on with a skirt over. Men in trainers and jeans. The only thing that they seem to worry about is men in shorts. The service was not great. There were no spoons for the mini panna cottas. No spoon for the clotted cream. In fact the only time they really wanted to help was to sell you more Champagne. Our bill was 350 dollars which was a lot in my opinion. We have afternoon tea in London frequently and for this price we would be treated like royalty. The sandwiches were uninspiring with no choice offered. There was no enquiry for dietary requirements. You receive one egg, one tuna, one chicken, one smoked salmon and one cream cheese triangle. The bread was curling on some of the sandwiches. The buffet was again just ok. The hot items were just warm. The fruit was nice.Be prepared to pay 9 dollars for a coke We did this as it was one of the things to do. However if I returned I would choose an alternative. They do not allow non residents in the hotel which I can understand on the bedroom floors however it would have been nice to appreciate the building and decor.
5
It is a Buffet Style setting of great Indian Food both vegetarian and non vegetarian. There was a great selection of both. They serve hot selection of breads to your table which was great. They have a great selection of condiments and really yummy dessert selection as well. Would highly recommend the Tiffin Room for great dining experience
5
This is quite popular so we booked in advance. We were shown to our table and offered champagne (extra cost). If course e had to have the ubiquitous Singapore Sling (extra charge). The base price is for tea, buffet and a three tiered stand of sandwiches and small cakes. The service is, s you would expect, impeccable and attentive. Our easier said the experience is best aimed up in four words, "eat all you can". There is a strict dress code and one group wearing shorts were ushered into a different part of the dining room away from everyone else. Check the code when you book. Fabulous experience. Afternoon tea, two champagnes and two Singapore Slings came to $250 SPD (with tax). Highly recommended.

Visited the Tiffin Room for dinner. This was a bucket lister for me as my parents met in Singapore at a dance in 1952. Whenever they had time to escape their duties - my father with the RAAF, my mother with the Royal British Army Corps - they spent time here as one of their favourite haunts. Obviously the hotel and grounds have changed and the ground floor is stuffed with shops which seem to plague historical landmarks like the Raffles the world over. Nonetheless, the experience is worth it. The edifice is understated and I had several very agreeable pre-dinner single malts in an ante-room with nicely stuffed armchairs listening to a pianist tinkling the ivories. He played Moon River which was our favourite song as a child. Dinner was a buffet which comprised the choice from a variety of hot dishes, sweets, after dinner snifter and coffee. The room is comfortable with high ceilings, astute table arrangements which give you more room than there actually is, and apart from providing a spectacle for the constant stream of gawkers on the sidewalk, this was a relaxing and splendid meal. I would return
5
This place is located inside Raffles Hotel and is a super place to experience. My suggestion would be to go for an experience for the afternoon hitea and you will not be disappointed. Some people show up very well dressed but as long as the attire is business casuals you would be fine; in essence no shorts allowed. The place has a three tier stand followed by a buffet which costs 62 SGD per adult . Don't forget to order Singapore Sling. Try this place more for the exquisite experience
2
Afternoon tea was fully booked for the duration of our stay so I thought the Indian Buffet would be a good alternative. Stone cold plates and food ranging from warm to cold didn't make for an enjoyable meal. The selection of nan were also cold and like leather, despite the appearance that they were freshly prepared for your table. Such a disappointment and not once did anyone ask if everything was ok, so much for service too. I would avoid and stick with brunch or afternoon tea.
4
The grand old building is beautiful and I loved getting dressed up for high tea. You have food that comes to the table as well as a selection of food to choose from a buffet. We also had the expensive Singapore sling. I'm still glad we did this but I was a little dissatisfaction thinking it was going to be more fancy. Food was nice, could of been better since it's very expensive.
3
in such beautiful and expensive place loaded with so much history one can expect top-notch service.
particularly at tea time in the garden.
the service staff was not at the level we experience even in 4-star hotels.
5
We went for the evening curry buffet - expensive but the surroundings, service and overall ambiance were worth it.The food choices were extensive and, for me, very flavorsome rather than chili hot, though I'm by no means a expert in this area.
5
A beautiful graceful timeless pastime afternoon tea. Pristine white table cloths impeccable staff . Plenty to fill the biggest of apertites with sand which refills and a Buffett. Excellent. Not cheap but that's Singapore
2
Very expensive! Sandwiches very dry, not impressed with the quality of the food for what you pay.
Our hotel Pan Pacific is far better.
5
This elegant room was the perfect setting for an amazing breakfast. From dim sum to specially made omelets, the breakfast menu will leave you very very happy.
3
The Tiffin Room at Raffles is probably the ultimate destination for a nostalgic high tea in Singapore but, move beyond the nostalgic and gorgeous surroundings, and the sandwiches are begging to curl around the edges and a menu overhaul is needed.You come here. not for the price (which is the cost of a second mortgage) but for the opulent surroundings of this Singapore Colonial Icon and in particular, The Tiffin Room.After taking guests here a few times for the "true Singapore experience" it may be time to start looking at other options. In spite of a few discussions with staff members about it representing extremely poor value for money for non-meat-eating guests, the cost remains the same with a buffet that is largely untouchable by vegetarians. While management will take care of some options, vegetarians are expected to pay the same price as non-meat eaters so, by the time the main platter has arrived (and yes you can ask for a few extra sandwiches to please the non-meat eaters), the alternative offerings4 are meagre by comparison and you would have to have several additional platters of these to make up for the woeful lack of offerings from the buffet - the only vegetarian option of which contained mushrooms (a common allergen) so not at all edible for this particular guest. With the exception of this, the only options at the buffet for non-meat eaters are an assortment of over sweetened cakes - including some where the chefs were unable if they contained gelatin or not. Indeed, one waiter said that the Panna Cotta was vegetarian because it was a cooked cream - whereas a classic Panna Cotta contains gelatin (another wait told me that it indeed, was not vegetarian friendly So, all in all, while the surroundings are magnificent, we found ourselves surrounded by stale bread on the sandwiches, waiters that couldn't confirm the exact contents of the food. The Tiffin unfortunately representing absolutely appalling value for non-meat eaters.In the 21st Century, Raffles and The Tiffin room could do much, much, much better for $78 per hear for a non-meat eater - and staff that understand the difference.Disappointing.  p.s - avoid at all cost a new desert call "Cavels." They were absolutely disgusting
5
Had gone for dinner to celebrate my first wedding anniversary. The service was impeccable and food was pretty good. The staff are attentive and look after you well. Happy with the choice i made to treat my family on my special day. And Yeah the choice of music was very nice. Thank you Tiffin room for your hospitalit
5
I was booked in for afternoon tea on the 20th November 2016 and it was an amazing experience. The food was really tasty and well presented. The staff were all very helpful and friendly and as lone traveler i was put at ease from the start. The Tiffin room itself was clean and impressionable.All in all i loved my afternoon tea experience with these guys
4
We visited the tiffin room for afternoon tea which was a delight. Great variety three tier tea tray , they let us swap out fish for other sandwiches. What is unique is the buffet where you can try Asian cuisine including buns, dumplings etc. Singapore sling cocktail is also a must. It is also great value of comparing to London prices as it's all refillable except the alcohol price for two of us including one Singapore sling , 10% gratuity and 7% tax was 200 dollars. Only negative is there is no wifi. Definitely would return the staff are also very pleasant and helpfu
5
This is the 3rd time taking high tea at Raffles over the past 10 years and each time it never amazes me what a wonderful tradition this is. While not cheap and you do have to pre-book at least the day before, it is worth making the time out of your busy schedule to find this oasis from the Singapore heat and hunidity.Impeccable and attentive service. Colonially formal but yet familiar.Relaxing atmosphere.Good food - traditional sandwiches and dim sum With the Fairmont group taking over the hotel I hope they preserve what is a great institution that is High Tea at Raffles
5
Fantastic service, great food, a wonderful experience all round. Can be expensive for wine and alcoholic drinks.
3
Whilst it is always a pleasure to have arvo tea here,we felt that the quality of the food had slipped. The service is very good but the selection from the buffet was not as good as the last time we visited.
5
When in Singapore you just have to go to The Tiffin Room in Raffles for afternoon tea. We also ordered a couple of Singapore Slings. Food was plentiful and excellent. Scones and cakes are in abundance from the buffet. Only downer was that you enter via a side door... would have been nice to have entered via the hotel lobby, but that is only open to hotel guests
5
Afternoon tea in the Tiffin Room is something you should experience when in Singapore. To dress up and experience an elegant restaurant with exquisite service is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. During our stay we also had breakfast here twice and dinner once. Breakfast is one of the best I've ever had. Looking forward to our next visi
5
We loved the whole experience. From the moment we were shown to our seats until we left we were made to feel special by our waiter. We were given extra sandwiches and tea and the buffet really adds to the afternoon tea experience- especially the savoury snacks and fruit. We both had Singapore Slings. You simply can't go to Raffles and not have one!!
5
Three of us went for afternoon tea in the Tiffin Room. What a great experience in a old colonial setting with tasty food and first class service. The food selection is far better than most top hotel afternoon teas - fresh fruit, sandwiches, great scone selection, spicy pasties, dim sum, cakes plus a selection of great teas (hot and cold). Splash out and have a glass of champagne! What a wonderful experience. Afterwards we went to the Long Bar for a Singapore Sling. An absolute 'must' when in Singapore
5
We were really looking forward to High Tea at the Tiffin Room at Raffles Hotel and were not disappointed.. From the friendly, attentive staff to the fine high tea selection served from individual three tier silver cake stand on each table. The waiters were knowledgeable on the types of tea available. The dim sum and dumpling selection was freshly made. Help yourself to selection of scones - jam and cream was on the table. Of course I had to try the genuine Singapore Sling. A harpist quietly played in the back ground and the waiter offered to take our photos. All in all an experience to be savoured and certainly not forgotten
4
This is a first rate Buffet which excells in quality ingredients and their preparation. Have taken both breakfast and the Indian Buffet Dinner and both can be highly recommended. The obvious downside is the pricing which whilst livable with for the food, is exorbitant for drinks
4
Visited for afternoon tea to celebrate mother's 60th birthday. All family enjoyed afternoon of smart dress and wonderful service at raffles. Table filled with selection of cakes and sandwiches and selection of hot food buffet. Server Marvin was great, harp player was extremely good, was very enjoyable, thank you
1
Raffles hotel is highly renowned, so my mom assumed the high tea would be superb there. It was about 65 SG dollars. But honestly, all this hype where we had to wear smart casual for this occasion and the high tea was horrible. Even I could make a better high tea. The only palatable food worth eating was the bread butter pudding. They wanted to make it a traditional british high tea. So they provided a three tier serving of lousy desserts, cakes which you could buy from the supermarket. The tea wasn't of a good quality blend. They had an appealing offer of all you can eat dim sum, curry puffs and scones. But it was not fresh so really a waste of time to eat. For the prestige and name of the hotel and price, I would not recommend for people to eat. I am surprised it was still full house and many people went to eat there.....
5
Breakfast is served in the Tiffin room. The breakfast was wonderful and the room is incredibly elegant.
5
We experienced tea in the Tiffin Room which was well worth the experience. The service was impeccable and a harpest played a variety of classic and modern music throughout the hour and half that were there.
5
My wife and I enjoyed a great afternoon in this Fantastic place, A good variety of sandwiches and cakes were on offer along with hot dishes, coffee and various teas.
Add to this a harpist playing in the corner, Sheer Class.
5
Absolutely incredible afternoon having their famous afternoon tea. We were not dissapointed, and this had been on of the things I wanted to do before I died. Food was delicious, hot dim sum and then a three tiered cake stand full of sandwichs, cakes and dessert. I also had a Singapore Sling which was 23 SD and the tea was 66 SD sound a lot of money but much cheaper than the Ritz but was equally as good. Just loved it
3
We came for Birthday treat, not for the high tea but the curry buffet in the evening.The room was heavily corporate with a large business groups around the buffet area and holiday families like us pushed to the back. Battling to the food was a bit of a bundle. To be honest I expected a little more from a place of this magnitude and price tag ( our family of 5 were just shy of Â£100 per head - including drinks, but we did have a few!)Very attentive service - but the food, although good, fell a little short of expectation. Keep in mind I am a curry aficionado , my wife loved it all
4
Came here with business partners who wanted to savour the Raffles experience. We had English cakes servings and dim sum. Having been to afternoon tea at E&O Penang and The Strand Yangon, I thought the SGD 62 ++ per pax is steep. Tiffin Room did not leave with me a deep impression. The seating was cramped too. I had stayed at the old Raffles Hotel before its retrofitting; felt the old rustic Tiffin Room was better
3
I had always wanted to dine at Raffles and was very excited about having the curry buffet . Both myself and my husband love curries so were very keen to see what a grand hotel like Raffles would serve.The room itself was lovely . The service was average and the buffet was nice but nothing amazing . Especially for the money . There are a lot of excellent buffets at hotels in Singapore and in next time that's where I will go . Just go for the Singapore sling ( which is very overpriced) and leav
5
This was recommended by the friend of a colleague and so we had dinner there on the night we left Singapore.Of course the Tiffin Room has all the atmosphere of Raffles Hotel and the superb service you would expect.The Indian buffet was amazing with such a variety of dishes from meat and vegetable curries to lovely chutneys. The dishes did not have too much heat and the spice flavours were excellent. I would thoroughly recommend and not too expensive
5
Afternoon tea at the Tiffin Room is an event. The ambience, food, service and music make it very special. There is so much beautiful food, we did not have lunch nor dinner on the day. There is so much to choose from. Just make sure you save room for bread and butter pudding and vanilla cream. We also enjoyed a Singapore Sling (it was a little too much - but, how can you not!). The harpist plays in the background. It is a good idea to get a little dressed up for the occasion, and dont't forget to book
4
The Tiffin Room at Raffles was a beautiful setting for afternoon tea. My non gf family loved every minute of it, including the food. The gf version of high tea was so incredibly disappointing. Scones as hard and heavy as hockey pucks. Bread so thick and hard for the sandwiches that I scraped off the filling and ate that. Then the dessert part....well. Basically a shot glass of strawberries in sugar syrup and the same for blueberries!! They could have at least done a creme brulee, mousse or panna cotta.I plan to take family again, as the service, atmosphere and non gf food was excellent. However I won't be eating. I'll see if they can do a drinks only afternoon tea. Still feeling sad about it
5
I loved the fact that I could have champagne and breakfast at the same time ..very traditional and made us feel like we where in heaven ...thanks for a great time
4
Enjoyed an excellent breakfast in the lovely colonial setting of The Tiffin Room. Extremely expensive though and not particularly good value which you could say for Singapore full stop!
5
There are a wonderful selection of curries available, north Indian in origin, they are simply delicious. start with a selection of starters such as soup, chicken tikka, etc. Then move on to the delicious and sensitively spiced curries, whether chicken, lamb or beef. The dishes are accompanied with a selection of Naan breads and there are home made chutneys to add that little extra. The poppadum are lovely and the deserts are a fitting finish. All in all an experience well worth it 
5
Beautiful refined setting with top notch service. Delicious buffet but impossible to try everything! Very good wine list with a lot of choices at different price points. We went on a Saturday evening and it was very quiet, so not a place if you're looking for a party.
5
This was an essential thing on my list to do when visiting for the Grand Prix weekend & it didn't disappoint. Our waiter was friendly & attentive, presenting us with a gorgeous cake to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The afternoon tea selection was plentiful & our sandwiches were refilled upon request. We had a few trips to the buffet, tea & coffee kept being refilled & poured for us. We finished off with a visit to the Long Bar for a Singapore Sling & a few peanuts!
4
I booked online and noted that it was my daughters 11TH birthday. I was contacted by Raffles asking if I wished to have a complimentary birthday cake and what inscription would I like? When we arrived on the day, each staff member wished her a happy birthday and she got extra service and attention. The cake was brought out as a surprise and staff sang happy birthday! The high tea was value for money as far as high teas go. Some balk at the cost but I have had equally expensive High Teas in Sydney that did not have the ambience, service or quality. The only small thing which I thought odd was all the gorgeous silverware, and tiered stands, crisp linen and packet sugars?!?! I have to admit that I expected sugar lumps in a dainty pot or granulated sugar perhaps? It kinda was a small detail they could fix to maintain that total air of sophistication. Overall a magical high tea and a very happy family. We would not visit Singapore without making Raffles Tiffin Room a tradition
3
We were there to experience the best hotel in town for breakfast. The food is limited in choices and main dishes on menu for select. I ordered an egg benidict. Muffin became crispy and spinach beneath were just boiled without flavor. Coffee tasted flat. Ambience was good and waiters are bit too busy to serve guests.The hotel is served in a bit frugal way
2
Having booked afternoon tea we were kept waiting in a long line outside well after the time of our booking.The decor and ambiance was excellent but the quality of the service and the tea was poor. When a pot of tea eventually arrived it was so weak it was tasteless, it was sent back and replaced by a pot virtually the same. After some discussion with a lady who appeared to be in charge, she apologized and returned with another pot of tea. This had not been made with loose tea as the others had, it was just stuffed with at least 6 tea bags and so strong it was undrinkable. At this point we gave up on the tea. The food was average sandwiches, cakes etc. on the table, some hot buffet food was also available but it was necessary to queue up with the many people in the dinning room.This is not the sort of service and quality of food I expect from a five star hotel at the price they are charging. We have had much better afternoon tea all over the world
4
We appeared at Raffle's renowned afternoon tea haven "Tiffin Room" without booking and was declined as it's all full ( as expected ). Upon inquiry were told there was an opening the next day for 4:40pm and instantly snapped it up.The next day we reached its door at 5pm cos we got in late from a fun excursion in Sentosa and thank god UBER came to our rescue cos the taxi queue was impossible outside the Sentosa express MRT station. Anyway, when we arrived the reception lady at Tiffin Room told us our table had already been given to someone else, which was 100% understandable cos we did not call to inform them of our delay. I urged her if we could still grab another table and she looked a bit hesitant but finally agreed to take us in. But she told us we only had 30 mins for actual food order / replenishment cos their afternoon tea is until 5:30pm but we could stay until 6pm when everyone has to leave to allow them to prepare for dinner. We're ok with that as that was our last full day in Singapore and we're determined to have tea there and see if it's really as good as it's claimed to be.Indeed it was full, even at 5pm. All guests were nicely dressed although you don't need formal attire like what is so commonly seen in London's Ritz afternoon tea when top hats and fancy Derby & Ascot hats adorn heads. Raffles is more approachable and relaxed, a lot less stuffy than Ritz for sure.Everyone is to have the same tea experience ( three-tier stand + mini buffet ) so all is set for you, unlike in most British tea rooms that you can have a variety of food / drinks combo. The three-tier stand is delivered to your table while there is a good selection of buffet items 20-30 steps away ( or 10 steps if you sit close enough ) that include three types of chilled herb or fruit teas in big glass pitchers that need constant refill cos thirsty guests need to cool off in the forever scorching Singapore weather. That day we got iced mint tea ; iced assorted berries tea and iced Raffles special blend tea. All was refreshing and natural without added sugar so that was nice.The 3-tier stand features assorted English finger sandwiches on homemade bread e.g. smoked salmon with cream cheese; paper thin cucumber with cream cheese ; egg mayo and chives; turkey ham & chicken with mayo. They will gladly refill your finger sandwiches if you so request. Then there're the delicate sweet selection e.g. citrus tartlets ; basil panna cotta with strawberries ; coconut cake with kalamansi curd ; raspberry madeleine and choc praline cake. The buffet items are all well-made and not like mass produced food churned out from a big commercial kitchen. There are piping hot dim sums like decent bite size har gau, siu mai, char siew bao, vegetarian crystal dumpling and seafood spinach dumpling. There are savoury pastries like chicken curry pie, and on that day we went there was warm croquet monsieur. Additionally there are baked fruit tarts and sliced fruit cake. Hot dessert that day was bread & butter pudding with smooth and not overly sweet vanilla sauce. Also featured on the buffet table was a nice selection of seasonal tropical fruit e.g. water melon; cantaloupe; pineapple etc. How could any proper afternoon tea be complete without scones and clotted cream? Tiffin Room's scones are displayed not on the 3-tier stand but in the buffet, so you can take as many plain / raisin and scones of the day as you desire. Their strawberry jam was good---gooey and not overly sweet but it doesn't say 'homemade' so it could be a very top brand, but for an establishment like 5* Raffles it should not be a prob to have their own homemade jam. Their clotted cream was creamy silky rich and fragrant, and they are more than happy to bring you more if you want. I specially say 'fragrant' here becos some clotted cream while creamy,rich and smooth, lacks the subtle fragrance of some delectable clotted cream with a pleasant after taste that will linger in your palate. We asked three times for more clotted cream so that says something about the taste and quality. Having said that, we had had better scones e.g. in Fortnum & Mason or Claridge's but Tiffin Room's aren't bad either. We had to remind ourselves we were in Singapore and not in London and that helps to be more lenient in our comments.This tea is S$62/adult and S$30/child. Add S$26 ( 1 glass ) / S$48 ( 2 glasses ) you could pair it with Brut Reserve Champagne. Naturally there is a nice tea selection plus coffee and chocolate to complement the food.The resto is nice and lofty, spotless with creaseless and thick starched white table cloth, bright cos the French windows are very clean, and ambience is calm and cheery. However, tables are rather closely positioned especially if you are in the middle of the room, so request for window seats for more space to move around. Otherwise you can easily 'eavesdrop' in the next table's conversation. Waiters and waitresses look professional and are obliging and pleasant. Service that day was prompt and attentive enough but not over. There were two other tables near us that remained after 5:30pm and we then realised we're all from the cruise and so we continued exchanging our cruise experiences and forgot about the time. Even though we all stayed on chatting endlessly away after 6pm nobody came up to shoo us out. We were glad to have cut short our hot and exciting1/2 day in Sentosa and insistent on spending a cool, leisurely and well-pampered afternoon in one colonial bit of Singapore
4
The high tea here is a must! It is a lovely thing to do with someone who is visiting Singapore. I find it reasonable for the atmosphere as well as the variety of treats on offer. Not only do they serve you a three tired tea tray you can also select from the buffet of canapes and cakes. They ever refill the sandwich tier upon request! The service is very friendly and professional
5
What a superb place to go. Perfect service perfect Indian buffet in a film set from the Raj. Impeccable restaurant that always keeps its standards up. Third time here and will be back.
5
Great evening buffet with great choice of Indian style curries. They were, too spicy for our 10 year old, so the chef made him Satays and rice. Excellent
4
We stayed in Raffles for 5 days and eat in the Tiffin room one evening. The food was lovely and the taste of the different curry dishes was amazing, a little expensive at SGD 75 per person plus drinks but go for the experience.
5
The ambience and service was fantastic and the quality of food was high too, if you love North Indian food, do not give this Buffet a miss!
5
Definitely a must do if you want to have a different experience a "Hi Tea" .. Everyday between 3-5 they have a High tea plan where you will experience the English style 3 Tier stand and tea with assorted pastries, sandwiches, dimsims, and loads of other stuff to bing on .. you will need to do a prior booking to get there.. A live Harp playing in the background and you enjoying the yummy patisseries and your buddies is a total new experience. The hotel itself is very colonial and has a royal touch.. Touche
4
It's in Raffles, so the ambience is perfect. The staff are, in the main, good, although a hint of enthusiasm would help.The Indian buffet-style thing I find irritating, but the kitchen supplies fresh, warm naans, so it's a cut above the norm. It's only just a four star, in my book
3
When we arrived at Tiffin Room, through the main entrance of the Raffles Hotel, the first impressions were good: magnificent surroundings, attentive staff, good table and even a little chair for personal belongings. The place was quite empty on Saturday night which we found rather strange. The reasons became clear rather quickly.The restaurant has a buffet setting, quite mixed up. Northern Indian dishes served were at best average. Waiters made a big fuss about specially prepared naan bread – they must have mentioned that at least thrice. Well, we waited and waited, ate our dinner and finally…the naan bread arrived. Quite standard and, after all that build up, disappointing.Deserts were quite limited and rather unappealing. Staff turned out to be quite inept and slow, empty plates not cleared on time and the restaurant wasn’t even half-full!Overall, second-rate experience although at quite reasonable prices considering the establishment. Rather pretentious too, with regards to the dress code. I can expect smart casual for a la carte meal but not a buffet
5
Dining in the Tiffin Room is a wonderful experience, not to be missed if you have the chance. Dining is fine and elegant with only the finest selection of dishes.I'm fortunate to be working and living in Singapore and when we have office guests they often ask to dine here - I am the first to volunteer to accompany them!!!Some criticism can be read in Trip Advisor of the dress code - referring to it as old fashioned and Colonial. It is a Colonial hotel that has maintained its values. I for one don't expect to see guests in shorts or sandals having lunch at the fine dining restaurants in this hotel. Well done management - keep your standards in place.On arrival our reservation was in order for a table for three. We proceeded to our table and was in awe of the wonder North Indian selection in the buffet. All tastes are catered for -vegetarian and non, hot and mild. We enjoyed a little of each- the accompanying dhal is particularly creamy and delicate. Additionally chef sends a special taster to your table which was fish - simply melted in our mouthed.The restaurant has an ambiance you will only find at Raffles. It is comfortable and well air conditioned. Service is impeccable and is one of Singapore's finest restaurants. Keep up the tradition - long may Raffles be there to enjoy the finest of cuisine
5
This places has an amazing breakfast the quality is super....although the staff do forget to bring everything which adds to the fawlty towers charm of the whole hotel.The dinner was excellent the fresh warms nan bread a pleasure impeccable service.Two reasons to visit this hotel
1
Staying in Singapore with my wife I decided to have lunch at Raffles Hotel (due to its historic significance). Very hot day ! Vacation time. When I make it to the entrance, First words From the hostess : 60 plus p.p. menu, when I didn´t asked. Secondly, you cannot get in because you don´t wear long pants.I said OK, remain in the 19th century. Now I understand the reason why there were a lot of empty tables

We took some friends who were visiting from Australia to the Tiffin room for high tea - everyone loved it. The staff were very helpful with our two little children (providing delicious hot chocolate) and the food was amazing. More than you could possibly eat.
5
Being long time high tea fans we pre-booked for the Raffles experience before leaving New Zealand. $60.00 dollars SG or so with bubbles or other alcoholic drinks extra if desired. Went for a recce the day before so we knew where we were going and were reminded of the dress code. Long trousers and covered shoes for men. This prompted a flying visit to Mastafas 24 hour store for trousers and shoes. $50 all up!!! Glad we booked as people were being turned away as we arrived. Room setting very beautiful and staff highly attentive. Had Raffles house tea (endless supply). Not the most formal high tea but three-tier tea tray goodies all delicious. They will top up any item from the tray that you particularly like. We had extra sandwiches as they were so good. Then you have scones (plain and raisin) and numerous other cakes and goodies at the buffet, as well as three varieties of fresh dumplings a personal highlight. Have a light breakfast and then after Raffles you will not need any dinner. I would certainly go again which I would not say of all the high tea experiences we have had round the world.

Expensive with fair to middling food. Would have got this place a three star review. But the terrible / almost non existent service makes this an easy one star review. No one there to show us to table, almost had to beg to get drinks to the table and no explanation of the buffet options. Truly very poor. Don't bother
2
My friend and I thought this was overrated ! It stated on the booking to dress smart no flip flops, but when we went, there was women in flipflops and scruffy dressed men. The cakes were not that good either.Afternoon tea at the ritz in London is far better !We then went into the long bar to have a Singapore sling as this is where they were invented and wow the price !! 71.00 Singapore dollars for 2 slings 
3
From a distance the Raffles looks beautiful, but when you get up close. It's tired and in need of refurb! High tea was lovely & service was impeccable, but I was less than impressed by the price of their iconic Singapore Sling. My glass was cracked so returned it, but for 31 sing dollars. I would expect it on a silver platter. Silly really because people just won't go there. Won't go back
4
My third visit, and I was a bit disappointed. Firstly we had booked but our table wasn't ready, and it took 10 minutes to sort out, despite loads of empty tables. Annoying.Secondly despite the buffet being its usual uber high standard, and my eggs Benedict being lovely, the wait staff got the Boy's pick sausage sandwich wronger than wrong. Chicken sausages, no sandwich. We could have pointed it out to the staff and I am sure they would have corrected it, but we were with family so didn't want to create a fuss. He ate some of them...and it's an amusing memory for him.We'll definitely go back though.

The Tiffin Room is located within the iconic Raffles Hotel, serves an Indian Buffet, for dinner and lunch, both Vegetarian and Non Vegetarian. The buffet has limited choice as the focus is more on the setting and the ambience rather than the food. The limited choice is sufficient for a business lunch.The colonial setting of the restaurant is excellent, the food is ok to go by. The service is not attentive and at times one has to wait to attract attention rather than them watching the diners. A dinner buffet is SGD 75 per person +++ can gross up to SGd 125 per person. The Singapore Sling was concocted at the Raffles.For the tourist it is a must visit, good souvenirs available at the Raffles Gift shop. Don't go for the food, go for the experience
3
You need to queue up outside waiting to go in, you must prebook your table as i doubt very much you would beable to just walk in. You are greeted at the door where they check your booking and then you are shown to your table. You are given a small selection of sandwiches and cakes, you can then go and help yourselves to a hot buffet and other cakes as well. Having had afternoon tea in several places this was a little disappointing considering where you are. The food was just average, the setting was lovely and a harpist was playing while we were eating. Well this can now be ticked off the bucket list.
3
A lovely calming environment which is rife with history. Sadly, the standard of the traditional afternoon tea has dropped significantly. This was not our first visit and the food was just not the standard you would expect from such a hotel or what it once was. The staff were very attentive and lovely but the food let the experience down
1
We went here for afternoon tea. The service was ridiculously slow, and they paid no heed to a nut allergy despite being informed of it when we booked months beforehand. After our waiter (twice!!) said he would check what items were nut free, and forgetting, we eventually were given an all allergies plate which was also gluten and dairy free, and was absolutely disgusting. As someone who suffers from a nut allergy I have been to many afternoon teas in London and this has never been an issue. We thought Raffles would be fun because of its reputation, but I would never go back, go somewhere else for afternoon tea, or go to one of the many amazing restaurants in Singapore. Don't waste your money here for awful service and tasteless, unpleasant food that is overpriced
5
Spent the evening enjoying the most spectacular array of Indian food. Apart from the large buffet we also had the chefs specialities brought out to everyone..... Sensational meal. Definitely do again.
4
It is expensive, but it is a good way of getting access to the iconic Raffles hotel. Have a drink at the Writers Bar first (nearly as much as dinner but worth it) and imagine being in the company of Noel Coward or Somerset Maughan. NB: this is much nicer than the Long Bar which is open to the public. Then move across the reception atrium to dinner: a great selection of upmarket north Indian cuisine partly buffet and party served by impeccable waiters. But, be aware, the atmosphere can be a bit stark and lacking, though generally worth it just to be in the hotel itself. Booking essential and be aware of dress code
5
Just loved this experience . All I can say is if you can you must.Little pricey but not complaining .Lovely little buffet to compliment the stand of goodies ,unlimited tea or coffee brought to table and cold drinks at the buffet Not rushed to leave ,very polite staff and lovely harp being played adding to the atmosphere. Fabulous
4
Set within the iconic raffles hotel, the tiffin room is full of 1930's charm with faultless service.Provides a buffet style curry that is very tasty but not exceptional. I was slightly disappointed for price by choice of starters and only 3 non vegetarian curries, one chicken,beef and fish.This is not a cheap meal but you are paying for the experience of the wider hotel which is something special. Be careful of costs of small bottle of water.. 14 sgd.I would recommend for the experience but there are better curry restaurants available if you are more concerned over food
5
We originally had lunch here about ten years ago and just had to come back on this trip. The lunch consists of fine Indian cuisine served buffet style. Food quality was of course as expected, outstanding. Waiters were very friendly and yet professional. Chefs were on hand to recommend dishes. The dining experience this time around was a bit different, slightly more formal than I recall before, so we were glad we dressed up a bit more. It's also more expensive than it used to be (10 year difference aside). So cost circa Â£100 for lunch with a cocktail each (a Raffles no.15 gin fizz!). My recommendation in, just do it, it's Raffles, the experience you will always remember, life too short
5
Excellent service. Particularly the waiter "Prashant" who was very helpful and went beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable. The "dal bati" and "malpoa" were the highlights of the lunch -- this was part of the Rajasthani festival. Food could've been spicier :
5
It was my first visit back in 20 years and I absolutely loved it! The service is phenomenal and the food, utterly amazing. I ate solidly for 2.5 hours and felt thoroughly sick afterwards-but, in a good way :) I cannot wait to go back. It's just a shame that not everyone makes it a lovely occasion as a group of Japanese girls turned up in denim cut offs and trainers... Cost was $62 Singapore
5
A good idea to book as numbers vary for this smaller restaurant within the Raffles hotel. The most delicious and diverse curries I have ever tasted. Attentive staff. A 'foodie' must
5
Have a large tea sorts and a very good service.For families very nice accommodation.Also good cookies and sweets
3
I was so looking forward to this dinner as it was a special kebab and curry night and my first time at the Tiffin Room! But it was quite disappointing. The biryani was very dry and not flavourful. The traditional mutton/lamb biryani wasn't even served! The only saving grace were the desserts and service! I desperately wanted to love this place but I'll take my indian cravings somewhere else
1
I had a few hours in Singapore early morning on Tuesday & hoped to have a nice luxurious breakfast in the tiffin room at the Raffles hotel. The place was difficult to find & as I made my way towards the lobby I walked past the restaurant & was surprised it was almost empty. When I got to the lobby, which was stunning - worth a look but they don't make you feel at all welcome - I asked the receptionist if it was possible to get a table. She asked if I was a guest & when I said no, her demeanor switched. She disappeared for quite a while finally returning to tell me that there were no tables & suggested I go to the bakery near by instead. When I asked when the next table would be available she looked flustered before catching herself to tell me that it's unlikely anything would be available today as they stop serving breakfast at 10.30. It was just after 8.30am at the time. I walked out disappointed & passed by the restaurant again noticing it was definitely empty & huge! Not sure what the issue was as I was dressed appropriately for a place like that. Pretty poor attitude for what's supposed to be one of the nicest hotels in Singapor
5
With an amazing range of tasty delights, excellent service, and the pleasure of a live harpist, I can only say that I am very fortunate, indeed, to have experienced high tea at Raffles

Went for Father's Day lunch (18/6/16). Food was excellence but staff manning the front desk (can't recall her name but sound Philippine). My Husband wore a Long sleeve sweeter but without collar n she insisted that the dress code for guys is the shirt or t-shirt need to have collar. She went inside to speak to the manager or the in-charge n infd my hubby can't dine if he don't wear collar. Seriously my Husband was dress well n only no collar. They offer to giv us a t-shirt n when she brought the t-shirt, the t-shirt look old but we really had no time to choose another place for lunch n end up my Husband change to their so call collar t-shirt n dine for lunch. During lunch, we notice there was only few tables (about 3) occupy by lunch including us n don't understand the fuss made about dining in with a collar attire for guys. There was even a couple eating with their hands. Why such practise is allowed n make a fuss about collar attire. Also the lunch was for Father's Day lunch n I did make note when I book online n the staff never once ask us anything on it or offer anything to my Father-in-law. What we enjoy was the food but service n staff n understanding, totally disappointing. To the front desk staff u tried ur best to be "nice" but u fail miserably.
5
One of Singapores iconic place to dine.Food is excellent and so is the service.In a typical Singapore style,all the processes work very efficiently
5
An elegant and beautiful dining room. Delicious breakfast and like the rest of Raffles the staff were unintrusive but very helpfu
4
This is an experience in itself in Singapore, a high tea in the Raffles hotel is breathtaking. The room is luxurious, the food wonderful and the service the best you have. It does come at a price but there is endless amount of tasty, bite size and fresh food. Everything from traditional scones and sandwiches to more delectable dumplings, curry puffs and nice desserts. I know this is an exclusive hotel however the porter followed us throughout the foyer and told us in a cheeky to nearly rude tone that entrance was from the outside and basically told us we weren’t welcome inside the hotel. The taste of the food however overwrote the bed taste from the porter
5
Have always wanted to go to Raffles hotel, so we booked for high tea whilst staying a few days in Singapore and we were not disappointed the food was delicious 3 tiered cake plate , cucumber sandwiches etc, and a lovely buffet with tea and Singapore slings. The bread and butter pudding was amazing and all served in this amazing old world place felt like we were back in the forties . Expensive but worth it... Recommen
5
Tiffin room is at the famous landmark hotel Raffles. It is well appointed, spacious, well lighted and well served. You can't ask for Indian food served in a better style. They have extensive vegetarian and non-vegetarian curries, parothas and rotis, spicy chutneys and soothing raithas. The service is impeccable and the price (surprisingly) is not bad
4
We decided on the Indian buffet in the Tiffin room for dinner before a middle of the night flight to Istanbul. Service was very attentive and the buffet had a nice selection of salads, curries and desserts. Some tasting morsels plus naan and a chicken curry were served at the table. Beautiful room and attentive service. The only hiccup was we asked for two glasses of white wine. It was unkind of the sommelier to bring two glasses of Chardonnay which appeared on the bill at $45 per glass
5
My wife and I are slowly ticking off High Teas in lovely places. Two others that come to mind are The Peninsular Hotel in Hong Kong and The Eastern and Orient Hotel in Penang.We booked from home for this, came prepared and dressed appropriately and had a wonderful time.The colonial setting is elegant, the food wonderful and the service was sublime. We enjoyed Champagne on arrival, the selection of foods, the bottomless pot of tea, the harpist, and the overall atmosphere.We would certainly list this as an essential experience as part of a Singapore visit
5
How can you stay at raffles or visit Singapore and not got for afternoon tea at the Tiffin room? The service is excellent the food to divine and its the type of place everybody should visit for pure indulgence purposes if nothing else.
5
Great place for afternoon tea. The room is beautiful and they normally have live music playing in the background.
4
The food was excellent and would definitely head back there again. Plus it is easily accessible by any mode of transport.
5
A visit to Singapore would not be complete without a curry lunch at Tiffin Room. Reservations are required and there is a dress code. The food was unbelievable and the setting wonderful.
4
We had lunch here. it was buffet style and all of the food was top quality. We paid quite a bit but I definitely think it was worth the "experience" of having a meal in the Raffles Hotel in Singapore - WHAT A TREAT
5
We had the breakfast buffet every morning and High Tea one day. The service was excellent and food was delicious!
4
Once in a lifetime experience. Expensive, but worth it for a birthday treat. Certainly had everything we expected- the tiered cake stand, the tea, the cucumber sandwiches and the Singapore Sling. Cost approx S$100 per person so not cheap but once in a lifetime worth it for a trea
5
Stunning, this would have to be the best high tea I have ever had. Very special... More food than a normal high tea and the atmosphere is just wonderful with a lady playing a harp softly in the background
5
This is a must do and a Singaporean institution. The tea is held in the Tiffin Room which is decorated in the best of British colonial decor. You will be shown to your table by the excellent wait staff who will also ask what type of tea you would like. They will quickly serve you a freshly brewed pot (which will be refilled as many times as you want)They will also you bring a traditional mult layered sandwich stand containing several high quality cakes and sandwiches, all of which were excellent. You can also request further plates of these cakes and sandwiches.This is, of course, very tempting, however there is also a buffet to which you have access. This buffet consists of more cakes, fresh fruit, the famous Hotel bread and butter pudding (Don't forget to add the excellent vanilla custard with it)There are also Asian foodstuffs such as dim sum, pork buns and, sometimes, a type of curry.Everything is of the highest quality and is worth every penny. Definitely a must do and you will not regret it
5
Several friends and I booked in to enjoy the famous High Tea that everyone talks about, and we were not disappointed!The room was beautifully decorated, tables perfectly set silver service, and a soft and comforting harp for background music.The food was exceptional, from finger sandwiches and delicate pastries, hot savoury rolls and wontons. You get what you pay for. We had a wonderful afternoon
4
A thoroughly enjoyable return to an earlier era when time stopped for afternoon tea. Our addition of a Singapore Sling was an interesting touch but I think the drink itself was over-rated.
5
definitely one of the best places in Singapore for breakfast. the afternoon tea is also a must try if you are in Singapore.
4
For business travelers this is a great way to start the day. You can even maintain a low, or no-carb eating plan here.
5
We had breakfast here twice and on both visits it was truely memorable, the service atmosphere and food where exceptional
We look forward to visiting again
4
Great cultural experience but way too overpriced. You can get better curry at 1/5 of the price. Freshly baked-to-order naan is the best but otherwise food selection is lackluster, even desserts.
5
We drop in at the Tiffin Room whenever we visit Singapore for its unique offerings in ambience and food. As with the rest of Raffles, this is one of a kind and addictive.
4
As a family, we've visited many higher end locations in Singapore for High Tea (as a family). Please see other reviews for comparisons.We have been to the Tiffin room twice, both for special occasions (like birthdays). Raffles is iconic in Singapore. Children under 5 have a significant discount and under 2 I believe are free.The food is buffet style and is good. The selection is not the largest compared to other high tea (mainly bread-related along with some Chinese dumplings and such). The quality is good.The service is top notch. Probably the best service of all high tea we've been too. They are attentive and at every need. This is what one would expect from such a location. Be sure to follow the dress code
3
Went for the Indian buffet dinner as I was craving for Indian food.The naan that was served to the table was nice and crispy but it turn hard has the minutes passed. Would have been better if they placed it under the heater.The mains was average and the taste of the food was not fantastic considering the price of the food.Dessert was great though. The cardamom ice cream was awesom
4
My first high tea at raffles didn't dissapoint, with plenty of excellent sweet and savoury options on offer. However the choice of tea was severely lacking for such a prestigious hotel and should be improved. A high tea should ensure the tea is the star of the show. A lack of non-caffeine options was also an issue for the pregnant wife
5
I've been to Tiffin Room twice - once for the high tea, and once for their buffet lunch. Their high tea is the quintessential experience for anyone who loves English high tea - quaint sandwiches, pretty mini cakes & pastries, and tea served in beautiful tea pots. The sandwiches and pastries are very tasty, but if you prefer a more Asian style high tea, you probably won't be impressed with it. I love English high tea and scones, so I was more than satisfied with the spread. The service, too, was impeccable - but it is Raffles Hotel, so you wouldn't expect anything less. The second time I went to Tiffin Room was for their north Indian buffet lunch. My husband isn't a big fan of north Indian cuisine, and even he was bowled over by how good the food was. The dhal and rotis were my favourite - so flavourful and fluffy! I was also surprised by the gulab jamun - I usually avoid it because it's so sickly sweet, but this was just the right size (bite size) and sweetness. We ended the meal with masala chai, which was the perfect way to end the lunch. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to have a good lunch or high tea in an elegant setting - the ambience and service is faultless, and I'm certainly ready to go back for more.
5
The food was great, in particular the special Kashmir naan and mushroom cheese. Though the dinner buffet selection was slightly limited in range, the quality was nothing less than superb.
5
My wife and I had dinner in the tiffin room during our stay at raffles hotel. The staff were wonderful and the food was outstanding.
3
I hadn't been to the Tiffin Room for high tea since 2007. While the format had changed a little - sandwiches and cakes already served to the table, with hot items including scones and bread and butter pudding at the buffet table, the service was pretty dismal . Once we were seated, service including tea and coffee was slow and we felt forgotten. Dress standards had also fallen - t-shirts, baseball caps and generally a less than 'special' feeling about this elegant room and event
4
It was full-house on a Sunday afternoon. It's a buzzy kind of atmosphere, harpist playing, chatter from the many adjoining tables and people moving about the room to and from the buffet tables.The 3 -tier plated service at the table was replenishable. We enjoyed most the smoked salmon and egg sandwiches, and the chocalate ganache. Choice of a small selection of teas, and coffee was well, just coffee. Selection of cold fruit teas at the buffet table, with puff pastries, bread and butter pudding, hot dim sum, scones and fruits. The devonshire cream was of a good standard.Service was attentive and polite, not obstrusive. 4 stars for the experience, with the food selection and quality about 3.5 stars.
3
Tiffin room and sandwiches, cakes etc very good. Totally spoiled by the queuing up outside in the sweltering heat. I booked online from the UK I don't remember the web site mentioning anywhere at all that there would be a sitting time rather than just arriving at a restaurant at a particular time. Hence the big queue, hardly the experience you go to Raffles. Also, there's clearly no dress code any more. For tiffin it costs $294 sgd for four, without champagne at $96 for four glasses. Don't bother. Go elsewhere. You're that welcome anyway from experience
5
Took visitors to High Tea at the Tiffin room. It was a lovely experience. The service was exceptional, the food spread was amazing with a great range to treats to try. I thought it was good value at $62 pp ++. Make a reservation, you can do it online.Great for families too with slightly older children.
4
We were so looking forward to having Afternoon Tea at the Raffles and we weren't disappointed! very nice room, great sandwiches and desserts, and of course good tea! Service is very good, the hotel is very charming, definitely make a reservation if you want to be sure to get a table. Totally recommend it
2
Plenty of food, but lacked flavour even the waiter agreed. Restaurant was nearly empty and was obvious why.The food was well presented but lacked flavour. Was like one of those curries you make at home. You just cook the meat and throw in a bottle of premed sauce. The flavour is not cooked through.Very expensive, tow beers and two dinners buffet style. $220.00 And was borin
3
Pricing is fine, the staff are lovely and attentive. The sandwiches are delicious and were a stand out! Unfortunately the tea was fairly disappointing, for two avid tea drinkers we didn't finish the pot. Somewhat disappointing for high tea!! Unfortunately you are made to feel little on the outside, having to leave the building and walk around the corner to use a bathroom open to the public! Marvin was a treasure, so attentive, friendly and sweet! Thank you
5
Arrived to find a lovely birthday card from the staff tog with a bottle of bubbly from my sons family, what a start to a fabulous tea experience. The setting and the staff could not hsve been improved, we did appreciate the aircon too!The food and tea were to die for, and, as if that was not enough, the staff brought me out a fantastic cake. Best couple of hours we've spent anywhere, and speaking as someone who has had a number of afternoon teas inc big london venues, this was value for money
5
Exquisitely prepared afternoon tea, delicious fare. Service was wonderful and the environment was sublime.
4
Fabulous hotel and very good restaurant. We had very enjoyable family outing.
The hotel has very nice gift shop too.
4
For a Royal experience for the British era, "the" palce to be. The set up, the table layouts, the cutlery, the service staff all display regalia!! Food is good, however there could be more options in rice and non veg. The food is tasty but not hot and spicy. Special note on the chandeliers- simply loved them. the service staff assistance is really appreciable. You can ask for certain special dishes on your table even if you are part of the buffet for the day. No additional cost was charged for this. Breads and tea will be separately brought to the table.
5
I was lucky enough to be invited to the Tiffin Room for the Curry Buffet on a business trip. The setting is elegant, calming and inviting. A subtle display of finery, silverware and attentive service all adds to the experience.The buffet was well set out, numerous dishes to try and ALL were delicious. We were fortunate as it was a mid evening visit so not many guests, giving the feel of top notch service. I think that I would go back too, if any of my travelling companions would be prepared to pay the fixed fee.If you are in the area and want a little pampering and some good food, this it the way to go
5
We decided this was the place we would celebrate our wedding anniversary which occurred while we were in Singapore. This would be the first time we had visited the Tiffin Room for high tea and we were not disappointed. The service provided by staff was attentive, the food was delicious, the drinks endless and the harpist playing gently in the background was superb. A day to remember
3
When we planned our trip to Singapore, a visit to the Raffles Hotel was first on our list of things to do. When we looked into it further, it seemed that the most popular thing to do was afternoon tea at the Tiffin Room, however as I don't have a sweet tooth, that didn't appeal. When I learned about the Curry Buffet, that was a game changer as we love a good curry!Our reservation was for 7pm and we were not admitted to the restaurant before that time. As we sat in the lobbly awaiting admission, we took a couple of photos of each other and we admonished by Security staff - no photos allowed! Seriously!Anyway, we finally got to the table and served ourselves at the buffet. I was very disappointed in the food and found the meat not to be of great quality, grisly and fatty. I would have expected that for the price we were paying, the quality would have been excellent. Sadly, not so!My local Indian restaurant in Scotland would soon go out of business if they served food like this, or tried to charge the Raffles price!I can now say I have had an Indian curry at the world-famous Raffles Hotel, but I did not enjoy it

My partner and I booked a 3pm High Tea at Raffles Tiffin Room for end-October 2015 (AUD $60.00 per person).We booked a month in advance and requested a window seat (although we know it’s not guaranteed – at least there would be a better chance of us getting a window seat if we requested it a month in advance).We were really looking forward to dining in the world famous Raffles Hotel, Singapore.Their confirmation email stated a strict dress code applying, where men are requested to be in collared shirts, long pants and covered shoes, so my partner wore a collared long-sleeved shirt with long dress pants, socks and closed polished shoes - this was the classy world-famous Raffles after all.We arrived on time, only to be faced with a huge queue of people, all waiting to get into the Tiffin Room for High Tea (photo attached).The queue was not moving and it ran along the outside of the restaurant – outdoors in the courtyard in the searing heat and haze. We were queued outside for over 30 minutes, with my partner sweating in the obligatory “collared shirt, long pants and covered shoes”. I have attached a photo of this queue.This was certainly not what we expected from such a famous and respected establishment.There was a couple from England standing behind us in the queue and we got chatting.They said they had NOT booked but thought they would take a chance to see if they could get in.Once we finally entered the Tiffin Room, my partner and I were seated at the most cramped table in the room…between a pillar and large pot plant – as far away from the window as possible and furthermore, the English couple (who did NOT make a booking) was given a window seat!We then waited at the table for ten minutes for someone to take our drinks/coffee/tea order, not to mention, the actual “high tea” food.Nothing.I walked over to a waiter and asked him how much longer will it be before we get attended to.He was very apologetic and asked if he can follow me back to our table, but when I sat down at our table, he just kept on walking and disappeared.Another ten minutes went by.Nothing.EVERY OTHER TABLE HAD FOOD AND DRINK EXCEPT US.That was enough.So we got up and walked out of the restaurant, through the lobby exit.A waiter noticed and followed us, asking why we were leaving.So we told him that it was the worst customer service treatment we have experienced in Singapore and that we will not recommed anyone to this place.That we were left waiting to be served for 20 minutes (and still not served) whilst everyone else had food and drink on their tables.That we had been put at the worst table in the room, given we requested a window seat a month in advance, whilst a couple who had NOT made a booking were given a window seat.The waiter was very apologetic and told us to take a seat in the lobby whilst he made better arrangements for us.Five minutes later, he escorted us back into the restaurant and gave us a nice window seat, next to the harp player.We were also given complimentary glasses of champagne and our order was taken for tea/coffee. Food came straight away.The food was tasty and there was also a small Asian buffet with dumplings, etc. which was delicious.It’s a shame we had to go through such a bad experience at the start.That queuing up for 20 minutes outside in the heat was just atrocious…we were ready to walk away just from that
5
Silver service afternoon tea, also includes Dim Sun buffet. We pre-booked and can see the menus when booking on line. Need to be there at the stated time (within 15 minutes. Very popular and we loved the sandwiches, pastries and cakes. It was understandably expensive, working out at 100 Singapore dollars but that did include champagne. The setting is what afternoon tea was made for. Well worth the experienc
5
Breakfast at Tiffins room what can i say but try the the Raffles omelet hint of chilies hint of coriander and the soft tasty cheese amazing. The continental breakfast is massive with lots of wonderful option try the pastry selection and excellent coffee on offer. Friendly staff great service
5
My friend and I went for High Tea in the Tiffin Room. The staff were excellent and attentive. The tables were set beautifully and the crockery and cutlery were beautiful. The afternoon tea was bottomless, you could have as much as you wanted...great value, would definitely go here again and highly recommend it. The grounds are lovely,....
5
Yes it's expensive. Yes it's a tourist must do.
Thoroughly enjoyed my visit. Staff were polite and helpful. Food was beautifully presented and fresh. The scones were a bit dry though. The plates and tea pot and the room created great atmosphere.
4
The colonial-style Raffles Hotel is a beautiful location for afternoon tea and, although expensive, it doesn't disappointment. An oasis of calm in a bustling ultra-modern city.
This is very popular, so reservations are required.
5
The chef prides himself on transporting you to India for your meal. Have been a few times and have never been disappointing. The food is delicious and the staff is great. Lovely experience.
5
A very beautiful hotel both inside and outside. We went here for a Deepavali lunch. There were not too many vegetarian options however the desert selection compensated for that. The food was rich and delectable.
4
Everything in the buffet is perfect. Amazing service in a wonderful hotel. Worth the price tag for sure.
5
It pays to prebook for an afternnon tea here as this is popular desintaion.Bookings can be made interactively onlineThe three tiered stand of savoury food, sweet food and petit fours was fantastic. If you require a refill of any of the food on the stand, this is complemetary. In addition there is a all you can eat buffet serving additional savoury (including Asian savoury dishes) and sweet items, including scones and bread and butter pudding. The drinks options include a full range of teas, coffees and champagne.The service was exce[tionally polie and efficient,The total fee was S$73.00 including taxes and service fees
4
In my review of Raffles Hotel I mention the rudeness of the staff. This includes the people staffing the entrance to the Tiffin Room who forget the customers they are offending are ultimately paying their wages. But, once inside the attitude changes by 180 degrees and they could not be more helpful or attentive. Worth the visit for Afternoon Tea if you ignore the effort of getting in

We have previously had the Tiffin lunch twice at the Raffles hotel.On this visit we thought our last night after being away for a month we would go to Raffles for the evening Tiffin (Indian Currys).It was so disappointing after being seated were were introduced to the waiter in a white jacket who said he would be looking after us he poured our drinks and vanished.There was only one waiter looking after 20 to 25 other diners, he was run off his feet.When you finish eating one course they would remove your plate and cutlery but not fetch any clean cutlery back.Also the hot starter selection was not like it used to be and only a fish, lamb and chicken curry
2
Afternoon tea was such a disappointment, Raffles and the Tiffin Room are definitely resting on their laurels here. A plate of sandwiches made from slightly stale store-bought loaves doesn't cut the mustard in this foodie capital. Cucumber sandwiches, while traditional, are quite uninspiring, not to mention the tuna mayo and egg mayo sandwiches that accompanied. The dim sum selection was equally uninspiring. The sweet selection wasn't great either. As it is nearly Christmas there were mini mince pies; I've had better store bought ones and a vague approximation of Christmas pudding which was pretty horrible. The only thing I ate which was really nice was the curry puff. There was also a choir singing Christmas carols. They had lovely voices but were so loud that it was impossible to carry on a conversation, for the ENTIRE tea service. Of course many people go to tea at Raffles simply for the atmosphere and experience but that doesn't mean the food needs to be poor at best. I've had Sunday brunch at Raffles and it was excellent so it's not as if it's a hotel-wide problem. My advice would be to give it a miss and check out one of the other excellent teas on offer in the city

Dinner at the Tiffin Room is buffet-style and the requirements on the staff are limited, primarily taking drink orders. Therefore, we could hardly believe how poor the service was when we had dinner there last night. Each time the waiter came to our table he immediately apologized for keeping us waiting (which indeed he had). At first we told him it was fine but eventually it became tiresome. The staff had a unique ability to walk by without seeing that we were signaling them, and seemed to run around without accomplishing much.After waiting a long time after signaling for our check, we noticed that they had forgotten to charge us for a S$120 bottle of wine. We practically had to tackle a busboy to make them aware of the omission. When our waiter brought the corrected check back to us, he didn't even acknowledge or thank us for having pointed out the omission but rather just silently put the check in front of us. So much for honesty!The food was okay but we will never return to the Tiffin Room

Had a enjoyable High tea session at Tiffin recently to compliment my stay at the hotel. The three-tier tea set comes with coffee or tea. Dim Sum buffet as well :) be sure to book early.
5
Loved our food and endless tea. We had the high tea with the buffet food that goes with. It is a very eclectic mix of food - a traditional high tea with then some delis is Indian and Chinese bites to eat.My friend and I loved it
4
We had the North Indian Buffet lunch and thoroughly enjoyed both the food and the experience. Service was attentive, food was plentiful (but not too much) and the surroundings just outstanding. Some people say it is expensive but it is in Raffles in Singapore! Finished our day with a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar
5
WOW WOW WOW - this is an absolute must for anyone who loves North Indian Food and history. The tiffin room is located in Raffles Hotel, which is an amazing place in itself. The decor etc are fantastic. From walking up the drive to leaving the experience is just fantastic. The staff are all polite, respectful and helpful. The Tiffin room is magnificent, the decor , the atmosphere everything is perfect. The staff are very attentive and make the experience so special. We had the North Indian festive buffet. All the food I tried was exceptional. The prawn salad was amazing. The daal makini was the best I have ever tasted - I really don't know how I will enjoy this at other restaurants now. The turkey etc were cooked to perfection. The staff brought around house specials of lamb and stuffed mushrooms which were exquisite. The desserts were of a very high standard and a mix of North Indian and western. No standouts all amazing. The staff made me feel special. The drinks were replenished as soon as we had finished. Cutlery was replaced each time we went up to the buffet. Chairs were pulled out for you etc - just a really special experience and one that will stay with me forever and more importantly one that we will add to every visit to Singapore from now onwards. The cost for 5 adults with non alcoholic drinks was $475 and given that we had over 2 hours to eat , the quality of the food, the building you were eating in and the overall experience it was exceptional value
4
We went to the Tiffin Room for the buffet dinner. The service was great, but we found that the food was not as good as I would hope from such an expensive place. It wasn't bad, it was just 'good'. For that price, I was expecting something great. I found the curries were mild in flavour. As a lover of Vindaloos, I was hoping for a curry with punch. The little tasters that were served to the table were far better than anything on the buffet table
4
We enjoyed our visit to the Tiffin Room in Raffles so much twenty years ago, and it did not disappoint this time. We tried to book online, but the booking was not accepted as they said they were full, so we asked our concierge to book a table, which he did, and when we arrived, they were anything but full. Go figure!The buffet and service were both exceptional, and our waiter and maitre d' bought other small dishes to taste and delight us. Last time we visited I nearly slapped the waiter's hand as he tried to take my nearly empty plate of cardamon and rosewater ice cream away, and I have always remembered the taste, but sadly this was not on offer this time. Still, lunch at the Tiffin Room remains a 'must do' experience while in Singapore. Many locals were there for their corporate pre-Christmas lunches
3
We booked our afternoon tea in the tiffen room in advance which I would recommend as people were being turned away. Also men will need to be wearing long trousers or they won't be getting in either! Whilst in the queue outside we were unfortunate enough to be asked to move as we were in the way of the photographer taking his afternoon tea shots which didn't make the best start then we ended up with a table by the door even though there were other tables available. Part of the afternoon tea is brought to you and the remainder is buffet style. The tea and coffee took almost 20 minutes to arrive at the table. The afternoon tea was average but worth the experience of the iconic building
4
It's my first afternoon tea experience.Coffee and tea scent is good and the starting 3-stories food tray is also nice.And the dimsum buffer is great.All staffs are fully kind and the elegant mood of raffles hotel is also wonderful.It is about 140 SGD for two person incld. Tax and s.charge.Little expensive but good to experience the afternoon tea culture
5
We had a wonderful buffet dinner at the Tiffin Room.The food was very good and the service first class! A nice touch was the offer of fresh items not on the buffet to our table. It is reasonably priced (for a Singapore buffet) and offered a great range of Indian food.We look forward to our next visit
5
In Singapore, the brand name "Raffles" usually depicts a certain high standard. Situated within Raffles Hotel, Tiffin Room held up its standard. The great ambience is partly contributed by the harp music serenading in the background and also the architecture of the building itself. Service wise is great for not without a reason. Our baby's high chair was set up before our arrival and she was given a set of toddler utensils. You might think that such basic gestures should be provided (as a matter of fact), but we have been to too many places which do not provide toddler utensils. We were served vegetarian afternoon tea as requested in our reservation. The food was tastefully done. In fact, better than even many vegetarian restaurants' high/afternoon tea which we have been too (but I shall not name them here). If you run out of the initial spread of food served on your tray, you can always go to the end of the room where there is a (free flow) selection of food and beverages for you to choose from.All in all, it was a very pleasant (birthday) treat
4
Breakfast is served here and in the evening becomes an indian Buffet. Beautiful colonial dining room with a wonderful display of Tiffin trays at one end. Food, both breakfast and dinner was excellent and service superb.
3
You think you are visiting raffles but your not - to have afternoon tea in the Tiffin room you dint have to be a resident but booking is essential. You are though not allowed into the hotel itself but have to enter the tiffin room from a side entrance there's maintaining the hotel grand foyer for residents only which was a disappointment - we were also very disappointed by the front entrance staff in their uniforms that had seen better days and liked dirty and shabby - they were also quite abrupt surprisingly and their focus was on hotel guests and not tiffin room oaying customers - the food although plentiful was average and lacked real choice for a proper afternoon tea although there was a selection of local foods too.
5
This is an Indian themed lunch in the Raffles Hotel. Food is excellent - lots of non curry options for those who want a traditional Sunday lunch (turkey and ham). The selection of appetisers, mains, deserts and cheese is first class. There are also additional house specialities brought directly to your table. Would highly recommend
4
We were here for Hi Tea. Everything is just very well done. My friend had this on her bucket list and just loved the entire visit! I was pleasantly surprised that we also had dim sum options and curry puffs and chilli sauce!! I do not have a sweet tooth and after growing up in UK cannot get excited about cucumber sandwiches!! However the cakes are very rich and tempting
4
Of course you expect dinner at Raffles to set you back a fair bit, but the cost of the Tiffin Room curry buffet is in my opinion, quite high for what you get. The food is good with a lot of different choice, but the buffet style setting is not very luxurious. It would be good if they offered buffet for a fixed price alongside a la carte as well. I don't have a huge appetite so that would have suited me better
4
I had really looked forward to this and it was to be one of the highlights of our visit, all I can say is 'disappointed'.We had hoped to sit and soak in the ambience of this famous hotel and was put in a side room which lacked character, although we were informed that it was a special room! And yes me & my husband were suitably dressed and had adhered to the dress code, more than I can say for other patrons.The food on offer and the service was not to the standard expected at such an establishment. We had to ask on several occasions for milk, spoons etc. which should have been provided. Overall a disappointing experience.If you want a truly 100% experience of an afternoon tea go to The Ritz, London.The hotel itself looked amazing full of colonial character
5
This is a must thing to do while in Singapore, and this is The place to have tea. The setting is very classy, with great choices of sandwiches and desserts served at your table, there is also other food options at the buffet. Dont forget to order the traditional singapore sling. Definitely worth it, I recommend to book as it gets crowded and do expect to pay premium prices
5
Cannot be bigger or better ..amazing lunch spread on the occasion of Indian festival Deepawali..great food spread with lots of sweets. The ambiance is excellent , so is the service . We were in festive mood with family and bunch of naughty kids , the staff really took are to see that we were comfortable and enjoyed the day ! Well done Tiffin Room

We decided to go in for Tiffin Room's Sunday Lunch buffet as we hadn't been there in over a decade. We called and booked a table for the same afternoon.Tiffin Room is in the lobby of Raffles Hotel. Raffles Hotel itself has seen better days and now looks like no further maintenance is being conducted and the Grand Old Icon is being milked for all it's worth.The Tiffin Room has the same ambiance. An old tired room that is just about keeping it together. The chairs are worn and lack any polish, the floors are dull and even the lights appear to have given up.Even worse than the decor and the ambiance was the service. We found the staff to be more interested in rushing around doing nothing. Many tables had to signal multiple times for their food/bill/water. A fair number of the staff were actually spending more time chitchatting among themselves rather than working. Shockingly, while the lunch service was going on, the staff were busy arranging tables for the tea session by moving tables and chairs. This completely ruined the experience of eating in a classic restaurant and made it feel like one was in a 'C' grade road side hawker stall.Unfortunately, worse was to follow; the food. We have never had such bad Indian food anywhere in Singapore or indeed the world.The food lacked any flavor whatsoever and it felt like it had just been put together.The Hyderabadi Chicken biryani had zero flavor and the chicken inside was bland as none of the spices had steeped in. My daughter left her plate as is. The Chicken gravy dish was bad as well and the chicken pieces inside felt old/tough. The vegetarian rice with saffron and mushrooms carried the flavor of neither ingredients. The chaats were among the worst that we've ever tasted in Singapore. Unhappily, even the naans and rotis were very disappointing.The desserts did nothing to uplift our spirits. The gulab jamuns tasted as if they'd been fried in stale oil. The jalebis were limp and soggy and the rest of the options were nothing to write about.Before we could get any more depressed, we decided to finish up and leave.Keep in mind that while the staff will ask you for your choice of drinks (lassi for instance), these are not covered in the buffet. Thankfully, we asked and therefore saved ourselves the option of getting even more disappointed. Coffee is included in the buffet and the Latte I had was the only acceptable thing for the afternoon.At over SGD 70 per person, this is an expensive way to throw money away and get bad food in return

A very special treat for our Pearl wedding anniversary. The Tiffin room staff gave us a special table with anniversary flowers and a hand written card. One very happy husband and a made up wife! One little gripe we both wish they would adhere to dress codes! Appart from that absolutely perfect...Thank yo
5
Never in my life have I seen a better breakfast spread than Tiffin's. Everything was fresh! Aside from that the staff was so quick and courteous, anticipating your needs right on time.
4
Afternoon tea in the Tiffin Room - a must do when visiting Singapore. Was very pleasant experience with more sandwiches and cakes than we could eat on a 3-tier stand. Music was provided by a harpist, which added to the relaxed atmosphere.Additional food available within the price from a hot buffet stand (for those with a large appetite).Go to the Long Room afterwards to sip on a Singapore Sling
2
To any corporate who wish to book the Tiffin, don't book, I had 40 delegates attending as they were not going to be a noisy crowd thought we could sit together, the restaurant took it upon itself to separate us in two tables of two for any event organiser be warned, they will ignore your request; this once was a great venue to show off beautiful architecture, ok buffet food however the food today is rather stale; when I arrive with my group they ignored a simple request of tables of 8 away from the main diners, to say it was a difficult night was an understatement, once one of my favourite hotels, will admire from afar next time and given the restaurant was almost empty I thought patronage of 40 delegates would be good but perhaps I'm mistaken
5
We enjoyed a High Tea in the Tiffin room with a couple of glasses of bubbly. It was amazing. The food which was placed on your table was beautiful, a mixture of sandwiches and sweets. It was continually replaced when the plates were finished. On top of that was a small buffet with other pastries and a few dim sum items as well (pork buns etc) It was a fantastic experience and I didn't need dinner after it! Highly recommend it
5
We decided to book high tea at Raffles while we were in Singapore before our flight home that night. We are so glad we made reservations before hand as it was sold out when we got there. We had an amazing experience and thoroughly enjoyed the delightful food on offer. We don't normally pay for such indulgences but thought we would do so - boy are we glad we did. The service was exceptional and very friendly and this of course, topped off our last day in Singapore. We definitely advise if you can afford to have high tea then this is the place to do it. A huge thank you to all the staff for leaving us with a memorable afternoon
4
The true epitome of British Tiffin, only spoilt by an American couple whom did not adhere to the dress code, much to the embarrassment of the staff were dressed in tee shirt and shorts they sat glued to their lap-tops.When I complained it was explained they were residents, I explained so were we but we had adhered to the dress code. The result was copious refills of champagne which went some way to reconcile the issue. It did dampen the whole event with everyone else keeping the dress code and looking very smart, some people, eh.....The consensus of most was the hotel should have been more decisive & moved these two out into a room somewhere or the reception perhaps, we agree.
4
We didn't actually get to partake of what looked like a divine eating experience because we didn't have a reservation and were told that they were completely booked for the next 2 days! The place looked amazing and the food delicious. Will definitely try again the next time AND make reservations ahead of time

Thought I take my young relatives to a special place in Singapore. I booked a table for dinner at the Tiffin Room Raffles Hotel….surely cannot do better than that….heard the open buffet is Indian food… I was really looking forward to a tasty authentic meal…and did not give a second thought to the expense. The main hotel lobby is elegant and the restaurant too although a bit stuffy I thought. However the food was a total disaster in my opinion , tasteless with no hint of aroma or romance…the service nothing special…the “signature” dishes that were promised consisted of a bit of roast lamp and cheese stuffed mushroom…again tasteless…..the deserts average...the only tasty bit was the nan !.....a huge disappointment for such a supposedly famous hotel..….at the price of over SGD 300 for three…which I was prepared to pay for a decent dinner….it was huge let down and I felt sorry I brought my young couple guests…trying to impress them with taking them to a special restaurant in Singapore
5
Firstly, book well in advance of your trip. I made the mistake on my first trip to Singapore, trying to book during the week of my visit (I couldn't get a table). I find that if I want to visit, a booking made up to two weeks before works well. It is a must do experience. I've been several times now and it's a place I like to share with friends, so take them there are a treat. Do not eat before visiting, there's so much there to choose from and all incredibly high quality. I usually have tea there, then make my way to the Long Bar for a customary Singapore Sling. This year it's the 100th anniversary of the Singapore Sling
5
Quite excited about having high tea at the famous Raffles Tiffin Room, of course had to have the obligatory Singapore Sling. The service is warm and inviting, the food is varied and delicious. It's was lovely relaxing to the sounds of the harp. I found it easy to book online prior to our holiday. It's not cheap but what the heck, you have to experience the charms of yesteryear
2
Tried the curry buffet. Horrible for the price they are charging. Service is below average. Can skip and just walk down to Raffles City...
5
If you enjoy dressing elegant and eating traditional delicacies in elegant surroundings then don't miss the high tea. You are served a 3 tier stand and there is also a buffet to choose from.
3
The surroundings are wonderful but i found the food to be very bland and limited in choice, we only had breakfast here and felt that they could do a lot better considering the quality of the hotel and the price bracket.

I am quite fond of an afternoon tea, having experienced the infamous Betty's in historic York and also another venue in Windsor UK earlier this year. So when I planned my first ever visit to the far east and chose Singapore as my destination I was intrigued to see if I could enjoy this indulgent treat during my stay and the obvious choice of venue was the old colonial Raffles hotel. An icon of elegance and high standards. I googled to see if they offered such a thing and read about the Tiffin room and straight away I made a reservation. I was celebrating my birthday during the trip but was cautious of booking the Tiffin room for the actual day in case it was not quiet all I had hoped.We arrived at Raffles at around 14:30 and were directed to the left hand side of the hotel, so not actually entering the hotel itself and began to form a queue outside in readiness for openings 15:00. Once open, the staff began to admit guests and checking them off the list. Something that did irritate me were people who had just arrived, looked at the queue, believing that having a booking, that they did not need to join the queue and despite being told the join the queue just loitered instead. Being British obviously I love queuing! Staff quickly dealt with us and we were ushered into the beautiful and ornate Tiffin room. We had a window table to the side in the first section, so we were furthest from the buffet, but that meant we had a good excuse to wander around and take it all in. The harpist was already doing her thing, so as you walk in, it is every bit as gentile and tranquil as you might imagine. Immediately a stand of sandwiches and cakes are placed on your table, your choice of drinks taken, with an option to upgrade to the Singapore Sling, which we declined, opting just for traditional tea. We were invited to help ourselves to the hot buffet of savouries and also more cakes and scones. There was also a selection of iced tea's which was a nice touch. The maitre'd worked the room progressively chatting to the patrons, his approach was both formal but also friendly and he had a good few extensive conversations, rather than looking like he was just going through the motions, he appeared to care about the experience and his customers. We were asked if we would like anything else to fill our stand once we had finished, and reminded about the buffet, which we had also fully sampled. We had three pots of tea! It is S$60 per person before tax and service charge are added (around £30 sterling), but they are not shy of helping you get your money's worth. The staff were fairly busy, but I felt they were all still without exception attentive and receptive. I think the food provided was a very good standard. Yes if you don't eat the sandwiches straight away, they will likely dry and curl. If this happened I am sure the staff, for whom I have a lot of praise, would surely replace them. I work in a demanding customer facing service role. I am used to the demands of the not so nice general public. Something I always find is customer's are very good at saying nothing until they are out the door (therefore having the last word) when it is too late for you to do anything about it or rectify a situation. In a similar way I believe that occurs here at Raffles, with many waiting to get onto TripAdvisor to leave damning reviews. In reality I can only vouch for my experience and not that of others. However from what I observed of the eagerness of the staff and the will to cater to most whims, why people still find a need to leave negative reviews. Just converse with the staff if you are not happy, you might be pleasantly surprised what a two way dialogue may achieve. For me personally the money paid was good value for money, don't forget you are dining in history. It will be a memory for hopefully many years ahead

Having the Curry Lunch in the Tiffin Room at Raffles has been on the Bucket list for a while. I would probably recommend that if it is on yours - go inside, take a picture and leave. We arrived (with reservation) to an empty restaurant apart from one other table of 4. Alarm Bells should have rung then.The food was ok but nothing that your local good quality Indian could have knocked up although the naan bread was very dry and brittle. Nice individual chicken pancake cooked to order but the rest was just in hot dishes.Service was attentive to the point of irritating but they were probably bored with a near empty restaurant. It did fill up a little by the time we left.On sitting down we were asked if we wanted a drink, water was asked for , still and sparkling which came in bottles. I noticed other tables were offered iced water from a jug but we weren't.The shock came with the bill. The buffet is advertised at $60 per head which we felt was pretty exorbitant for basically paying for the venue. The meal certainly wasn't worth it. However out bill come to $174, $54 on top of the Buffet price. The bottled waters were $14 each and there was s service charge and then VAT. An expensive lunch I think.

I had been here for breakfastbuffet & had booked before 1 week..The ambience of tifffin room is classy colonial style. Buffet breakfast is superb with Indian, malaysian & English Breakfast menu.The food here is really lips smacking & awesome.The buffet breakfast comes at S$56 dollars.The service is also very good. Worth Visit.RegardsSri(stunningshri@yahoo.in

For a brief glimpse of Empire & the Raj, Take High Tea in the Tiffin Room at the Raffles Hotel, Singapore.This grand old lady has withstood the test of time, seen off two world wars and emerged victorious & unscathed.A wonderful experience, worth repeating (and the tea is lovely!
5
The night we dined here there was a lavish Indian themed buffet which was fantastic. The look and feel of this place transports you back in time. The restaurant is located just off the hotel foyer and entering into the hotel itself took our breath away. We also enjoyed a Singapore Sling in the bar afterward with a pianist playing wonderfully. A magical experience we will not forget
5
We had gone to the Tiffin Room on the recommendation of a British friend who used to live in Singapore after a chat about not being able to get the kind of Indian food we liked in Sydney. He raved about the buffet and said it was a must to try if we were in Singapore. We were definitely not disappointed.Unlike visiting the Long Bar at Raffles, you do not just walk in off the street to the Tiffin Room as it is within the foyer of the hotel itself. We were escorted to the restaurant by the doorman which I thought was a lovely touch.Despite it being Grand Prix weekend the restaurant was very quiet which was a nice change from the city itself.The food was absolutely fantastic – we started with the soup (not something we would normally order at an Indian restaurant) then followed this with some of the cold salads/vegetable dishes. Next we tried the biryanis and curries before trying the salmon which was delicious – just melted in your mouth. We were also brought two rounds of various naan breads which were amazing, as well as some other little nibbles and chutneys throughout our meal. All of this left very little room for dessert which was a bit of a shame but we did manage some of the saffron yoghurt – fantastic!The restaurant itself is beautiful – so colonial and unmodernised just like Raffles itself. You can just imagine what it was like in its heyday.The staff were absolutely amazing – so friendly and helpful and not overbearing. Plates were taken away and wine glasses refilled whilst you hardly noticed
5
We stayed at Raffles & enjoyed breakfast at their classic venue, Tiffin Room. The staff were very attentive & friendly, which were delighted to see & is such a change to most busy, anonymous hotel breakfasts. All hot items are ordered directly from the menu - no hot buffet here, thank you very much! There are cold items to select yourself & these feature high quality Bircher Meuseli (always an acid test for me!) many choices of cereals, fruit & pastries. Very nice indeed. No mass market tourism in sight & what a pleasure. All hotel breakfast should be like this but alas, no. Highly recommended
5
.......HERE IT IS........the "Tiffin Room" (Tea Room) in Raffles Hotel......not to be missed. Savour the opulence and the many different hot and cold foods. There is a set price and go back as much as you want......you may never eat again!!
4
Breakfast is superb catering for all tastes from continental to Asian. Large buffet plus a la carte. Good service lovely surroundings.
5
I met up with a couple of friends in Singapore and wanted them to experience something very Singapore raj . The raffles is now magnificently renovated and mostly very touristy . However the tiffin room has not changed over the 40 years I've been going and probably not for over 100Years . Except since the 90s it's a full buffet and not served personally from carts . It's still great raj Indian food and as much as you could possibly want. Prices have tripled over the past 10 years but so has everything else in Singapore . It wasn't busy which I was very surprised but I guess there many alternatives at the higher price point . That's not the point it's the whole experience . Go back into time and enjoy .
5
stayed at the Raffles Hotel in May 2015, so used the Tiffin room for breakfast, the surroundings are very quaint and the staff are lovely , plenty of variety for breakfast with fresh fruits, yogurts, breakfast cereals and warm dumplings. You could also order a hot breakfast, I had eggs benedict which was fantastic. Would love to have he opportunity to stay again
5
Words cannot describe what a wonderful dinning experience this is.The detail in each of the cakes is sugar art at its best.Both sweet and savoury delights were delicious .One comment I would make is that it is a pity that most of the loud , rude and poorly dressed dinners sadly seemed to be my fellow Australians.Surely men can all make more of an effort that a singlet , thongs and scrappy shorts at a fine Dinning venue. It was dissapointing to see that this dress code was permitted by staff , when the female partners had gone to so much effort 
5
My partner and I prebooked for a high tea at Raffles prior to our arrival in SIngapore and we have been looking forward to it. We were not disappointed! The surroundings are gorgeous, the service excellent and the food were delicious. I had also asked prior to my arrival for soy milk and this was ready and waiting. In addition one of the lovely waiters came over to check through any of the foods that may also have contained dairy. We enjoyed every minute and every mouthful and will be looking forward to our next visit. A lovely and relaxing treat in busy Singapore
4
I went there for dinner last month and was completely mesmerised with the ambience and interiors of the restaurant. It makes you feel like you are in a different time altogether. The food is good, with a great spread for vegetarians as well. The staff is polite and courteous. All in all its a great dining experience
5
WE visited the Tiffin Room last week and were pleasantly surprised. The Raffles is a lovely building and an excellent hotel. And keeping with this, the Tiffin Room was exceptional in its decor and service.And the Food was exceptional both in taste and Value. They have Indian Buffet during lunch and dinner all through the week and weekends. Very gracious spread. Food was not very spicy not too oily as often is the case in many Indian restaurants. We had a lovely evening. The waiters were very helpful and friendly. about 50% of the tables were occupied on the Sunday night when we were there of which there was a mix of both indian and non Indian.Lovely table settings crockery and cutlery topped with good Indian Cuisine is such a rare find. Absolutely will return and take friends and family.Thank you Tiffin Room for giving us a nice experience.
5
I had breakfast everyday and the Resident Historian always there to talk to us about different interesting topic. The breakfast was great and service staffs remember my order after the first morning and I was greeted by name by every single staffs in this restaurant. I was amazed how they can remember my name so well
5
Pre booked our afternoon tea, which I would recommend as you may struggle to get a table. Lots of choice and excellent service and a perfect venue for a special occasion. I would suggest that the warm buffet could offer more choice. It is not as good as the warm buffet when we visited 5 years ago. Very reasonable charges, especially when you compare to the ridiculous prices in the UK. Perfect venue and a magical place encompassing the history of a past age which Singapore should not lose
5
Colonial decadence. Absolutely delightful with superb service levels. CAUTION!! Tiffin is very popular for non-guests and there is a queue outside, so make sure you book to avoid disappointment.
5
Also lovely to get 20% off bill by showing Singapore airline boarding pass. Great range of food and service in a calm colonial setting,
5
High Tea is a great experience. The staff are very friendly and professional, and the food is great. Huge selection - don't eat lunch before, you will be disappointed.

We went for the buffet dinner in the Tiffin Room at Raffles. The wine list is appallingly poor and highly over-priced. The dinner menu was primarily Indian and the there were plenty of dishes to choose from. The food was bland and nothing great about taste. The ambiance was very good. The price was over the top and it is not worth paying for such a poor list of wine and insipid Indian food
5
Lovely afternoon at Raffles. Beautiful surroundings and the lady on the harp was a lovely touch. They catered well for me as a vegetarian, not only was food brought to the table there was a whole table of other food to choose from - certainly didn't leave hungry and the staff were so friendly and accommodating. We had a table by the window and you can feel a little as if you are in a zoo as people are wandering passed! Loved the fact my handbag was given its own chair!! Shame the toilets are outside but very lovely high tea topped off with a 'special price' Singapore Sling for high tea customer

Afternoon tea in the Tiffin Room is a very reasonably priced tourist attraction (about £35) and includes great service, nice food and a buffet.Due to its reputation, I was expecting tea made with leaves, not tea bags; sugar cubes, not sachets; bone China cups, not thick rimmed cups
5
The service is very good. It was explained to us what the breakfast includes: both the hot ala carte selection and the buffet spread. The service staff were very polite and helpful, serving with a smile.There are many types of eggs, done in many ways. There are also some local food such as nasi lemak, seafood goreng, roti prata and even Japanese bento set.There are also many types of cheese, salad and bread. There is a huge variety of fruits-seventeen types including raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, lychee, rambutans, mangosteen etc. Both plain and flavoured yoghurt are available with a selection of toppings.It is also a good place to meet up with friends for a leisurely meal. The ambience of the restaurant is very pleasant and they gave us a little chair to put our bags. The embroidery on the white table mat and napkins is that of the palm trees. We had a very satisfying meal and one can choose to eat healthily here as there are sufficient healthy foods here such as wholemeal bread and glucamole. There are also many types of jams and spread available for the bread

Glad I dined in this wonderful room. However felt staff that were looking after us in restaurant only (not bar as they were wonderful) lacked any common sense or ability to anticipate our needs. We had to move dishes we had used to another table ourselves, ask for clarification continually throughout the night, nothing was easy - including getting the bill. Food was very nice but service not up to a standard I was expecting. Also we were sent outside with tourists to use rest rooms I understand that hotel guests privacy is respected but surely customers dining in special occasion restaurant should be shown to reception facilities not outside with tourists.. Had to put up with people peering in through windows while we were trying to have a romantic night which was also off putting

If this is what the colonial days were like, boy they ate well.Do not have any big meals before you have High TeaService is exceptional Silver service and food that is so tastyDon't worry about doing repeat laps for food. Everyone does itTea and coffee very ho

We visited Singapore for a Silver Wedding Anniversary trip. Part of our anniversary tradition is to have afternoon tea at a grande dame hotel wherever we visit and in Singapore there could really only be one hotel which fitted the bill - Raffles Hotel.I booked online approximately six weeks in advance and the process was completed very smoothly. I would say booking in advance is essential. On a Monday afternoon, The Tiffin Room, where afternoon tea is served at Raffles, was extremely busy indeed. We had booked for 4pm but service actually starts at 3.00pm and it looked like many people had been there for some time!The Tiffin Room is a large room with white walls, chandeliers overhead, fabulous vases of fresh flowers and the unmistakable air of the pure elegance of a bygone age. A harpist was playing to entertain the guests. We were greeted warmly and shown to a charming table in a window alcove overlooking the gardens and fountain. I had put my handbag on the floor but our waiter brought a tiny wee seat for it to sit on too! He then explained how afternoon tea was served and we opted for the champagne version as it was a celebration. After our champagne was poured, out came the cake stand with four finger sandwiches each: smoked salmon and cream cheese, egg mayonnaise, cucumber, and ham and mustard, also a mini macaroon, a strawberry tart, a mini chocolate souffle, a ginger/orange cake and a pudding "shot" of exotic fruits each. Very nice indeed!We had been informed that our cake stand could be replenished whenever we liked but as well as the cake stand, which is what you expect from an afternoon tea, there is also a substantial buffet which again, you can visit as often as you like. There were chicken curry puffs, bacon and cheese savoury scones, vegetable samosas, various types of dim sum, sweet scones, both plain and raisin, with cream and jam, fresh fruit, and what my husband really raved about, bread and butter pudding with vanilla sauce. I don't think I've even remembered all the items available either!We polished off the cake stand, ate our fill from the buffet, were topped up with our champagne and served two pots of tea as well. Phew, by that time we were pretty stuffed and no replenishment of anything else was required but we did see people heading back to the buffet several times!I've read some reviewers who think that the afternoon tea at Raffles is expensive. The price is quoted as $S58 per person excl 17% tax, which equates to approx £29 plus the tax. We paid more for the champagne version I think, approx £40 per head but bear in mind that for that price, you can have your cake stand replenished and visit the buffet to your heart's content. You can shift a fair amount of food if that's what you care to do!I think it's a pretty fair price for a hotel with a renowned history like Raffles, in such a beautiful room as the Tiffin Room, with impeccable service throughout. We can pay £15 for afternoon tea with prosecco in one of the cafes along our High Street for goodness sake and nothing compares to the £270 bill we were presented with for two adults and a 13 year-old (who ate nothing!) at the Burj Al Arab, Dubai, five years ago, good though the afternoon tea was.I say, put on your gladrags (dress code is smart casual but dressing up a bit just feels right!),and go and enjoy yourself. It IS worth the price not just for the food, which is far more abundant than in many afternoon teas, but for the experience of sitting eating it in the Tiffin Room at Raffles. Then have a wander round the corridors and gardens of this famous hotel, check out its Mall and maybe even treat yourself to a SIngapore Sling to wash down your sarnies. You've have to be pretty blase about life not to savour the experience

Delicious Indian food in an elegant setting. In particular, the curries are thick, rich and perfectly spiced.
4
Afternoon tea at the Tiffin Room is a real treat. It is pricey, but it is nice to savor tea, sandwiches, patisseries and the other goodies from the buffet table.
If you have time and don't mind splurging, I recommend afternoon tea here.
5
I have eaten indian in India the UK and in many other countries besides. However we where delighted by our indian buffet complete with a white Indian wine! The food was the best Indian food that I have ever had the pleasure to eat.
5
Breakfast yum. A little hurried so go early to appreciate and linger
Dinner yum yum amazing indian buffet had to experience it twice
5
Superb experience in the formality of the Raffles Hotel.
Superb service and really nice cakes, scones and muffins which we enjoyed very much.
5
A great buffet of very high quality. Good variety of cold cuts, cheese, salad, nuts, fruits, cereal, pastries etc A la carte hot breakfast choices of Japanese bento, congee, local nasi lemak, eggs cooked any way you wanted with bacon & sausage etc. Freshly prepared juices, specialty coffees & teas. Attentive & prompt service
5
Out of this world service. You're treated like royalty with your every need both anticipated and responded to.What an amazing spread, absolutely everything you'd need for the best breakfast ever.The Raspberries were the largest and most delicious I have ever eaten....oh my goodness.You're offered table service and then also get to choose from the abundant buffet....silver service at it's best in the colonial, heritage brilliance that is "Raffles"

I and my family went down to Tiffin Room on 21 June since I have been craving for good Indian food for a long time. Indeed, they have not disappointed me this time.Although the spread is not huge but I must say that the taste and quality of the food is fantastic and for sure the spices used by the chef must have been precise enough to provide such authentic food. I love especially the minced lamb that comes with the Naan. The only setback was that the fruit selection was too common and they should really put up some unique fruit and not just the usual selection of watermelon, papaya etc.Service was great and I would say that everyone including the chefs at the front was very professional and they even took care of my baby girl well.To whoever who crave for Indian food, Tiffin room will always be my number one recommendation
3
I came here once for tea but found it too noisy and cramped (small enclosed space, hard surfaces, no carpeting or drapes to absorb noise). The food was also average, but the ambience (decorative elements, history, good wait staff) made up for some of it. I'd probably return if I stayed at the Raffles again
5
What can I say. We stayed a week at Raffles and had breakfast every morning in the Tiffin Room. It's timeless and a wonderful way to ease oneself into the hurly-burly of a day in Singapore. The choice of foods from the buffet and the menu seems endless, with the staff always just a glance away to help you out. They'll chat if you want or just go about their work effortlessly if you don't. Our breakfasts were included in our accommodation, but it's probably worth having breakfast in the Tiffin Room at least once even if you're only a day visitor to Raffles. We found we ate so much tempting food we usually skipped lunch! We also had Sunday High Tea there, again timeless, elegant and so relaxed. It's a good chance to dress up a little and slip back to a more gracious era. There's the traditional three-tiered silver cake-and-sandwich stand plus a huge choice of cakes, pastries, cold cuts and fruits from the vast buffet. Test them with your choice or tea and don't feel shy to ask the staff for more of your favourite cakes or sandwiches. I'm not sure whether the champagne is worth it unless you want the full bells and whistles, but we received a complementary glass each anyway, which just made it magical. We also had dinner there one evening, a vast spread of Indian dishes that had us going back to the buffet time and time again. We're not big people and so just had small portions of everything. Okay, so to purists it may not seem a
5
I took only my breakfast, but their was a nice and diversified choice.
Service was incredibly excellent
5
You expect excellence at the Raffles, and it was, you need to be in advance and will queue to be seated at your table. The food was very high quality, staff very polite and attentive. Recommended.
5
This has to be one if the "must dos" in Singapore. The stylish Tiffin Room is just beautiful. The tea, cakes, pastries and scones are to die for! The service is impeccable. Worth the money and some!
5
Had a lovely champagne afternoon tea with my husband and son on the 10th May this year. It was Mother's Day in Singapore that Sunday, which made it extra special to be in this beautiful hotel with my son. The staff were really nice and very professional when serving your table. The food was great as there is also a buffet selection included in the price. Thought it was really good value for money, the three of us had a very enjoyable afternoon and would certainly return again

Since we heard that having English Afternoon Tea in Raffles Hotel would be quite an experience, we thought that we should go try it as a family on a weekend. As a fan of English Afternoon Tea, I have tried several around Singapore and also in London. Don't waste your money here. Firstly, $56+++ per pax is way too much to pay for English Afternoon Tea. Secondly the high price paid doesn't mean premium food as the food could only be considered average. The tea we drank also tasted a little thin as compared to what you would expect for a highly priced afternoon tea. Thirdly, service is mediocre. While they had many smiling waitresses, all of them are very specific about who serves which section of the restaurant. So we were left at our table for a very while, and 4 or 5 smiling waitresses nicely told us each time we called out to them that their colleague would attend to us. I find this not a very team spirited business approach. In summary, I wouldn't really mind if this was an afternoon tea in a random cafe at $25 per pax. However because I paid a premium for this, it is not very Return on Investment as compared to other hotel or coffee place English Afternoon Tea in Singapore that I have eaten. Comparatively I had a better experience in Ritz Carlton for their English Afternoon Tea
4
Our second visit (first time 10 years ago) not quite as good - Long Bar closed, table food - sandwiches, cakes etc were very good but the hot dishes were not very suitable for western customers. Again the staff were immaculately dressed, very friendly, helpful and well mannered - well done
5
While staying at Raffles Hotel we enjoyed the breakfast buffet and high tea at the Tiffin Room. The casual breakfast buffet had an extensive selection and superb service. For the High Tea, the tables were fitted with white table cloths for a more elegant look. Along with the traditional tea sandwiches and snacks, there were many buffet selections. No trip to Singapore is complete without High Tea at the Tiffin Room
5
One of those must do experiences when visiting Singapore, yes quite expensive but heck, there are somethings you just have to do in a lifetime. We walked in off the street and had a delightful breakfast, the service was excellent, very friendly, very efficient and very discrete. A great selection of meal choices
5
My family and I dined on a weeknight which meant that the restaurant was not busy. We were greeted politely on arrival and shown to a quiet table near the window. The wide buffet selection catered well for our varied tastes (including vegetarian). We really enjoyed the lovely atmosphere and the ambiance. The waiting staff were very polite and courteous and even acceded to my wife's request for some diced chilis. They actually provided 3 different types of chilis so she was very happy! Overall, a very pleasant experience
3
The food quality was above average but there wasn't much to choose from so that was a letdown. And I suppose taste caters more towards the western palate as it wasn't spicy enough for me. Dessert was similarly disappointing as aside from the 'Kulfi", an indian ice cream, there wasn't much to look forward to. Service was impeccable and i loved the mango juice but that wasn't the point of the visit!!
5
This is one trip all visitors to Singapore should ensure they try
pre booking is a must
but the elegance and style, combined with an abundance of selection make a wonderful afternoon
5
Check to see if your breakfast is included in your room rate. Otherwise, check the price beforehand...we thought it was too expensive.
5
A large selection of English and Asian delights - truly yummy- set in lovely surroundings
Visited 2013

Enjoyed a lovely dinner buffet at The Tiffin Room. Good Indian food in an elegant setting with very attentive service. A good choice of dishes along with some nice treats served directly from the kitchen but I particularly enjoyed the selection of Indian desserts.
4
The atmosphere in theTiffin room was a small glimpse to times gone by, it was relaxed and calm with hints of formality , the staff were excellent, very friendly and informative,encouraging us to try each dish. The food and wine were delicious too,,however it was more expensive than expected but well worth it 
5
Pre booked afternoon tea for my family and were not disappointed.Food and service were excellent and providing a small child like chair my my daughter in laws handbag to avoid putting it on the floor was a nice touch even though it was not an expensive one
4
Thoroughly enjoyed the experience of having high tea at The Raffles which, unlike our trip to the neighbouring Long Bar in the same hotel, was worthy of the price tag. The service was excellent, the food both of a high standard and plentiful, and the atmosphere refined but relaxed as you would hope. I would echo the thoughts of some reviewers below that this is not a "perfect" dining experience - the food is good but by no means out of this world, and I would be intrigued to find out how much of what was served is actually freshly made in house. Drink-wise, the English Breakfast tea I was served was little more than a tea bag dropped into a nice pot. I expected for the price I was paying to be served some fine loose leaf blends, perhaps some evidence I wasn't paying $70 for a cup of Tetley or PG Tips, and also more variety than the 5 or so teas on offer. Call me a snob but in a venue which promised a strict dress code I also found it disappointing to see a number of gentlemen having been let in wearing collarless t-shirts, against the advertised door policy. Despite this though I did enjoy the afternoon immensely and would definitely recommend others to visit. The Raffles management could however make a few tweaks to re-establish this as a signature Singapore experience to make it a must-do when in town
4
The English tradition of "high tea" is expertly preserved and executed at the Tiffin Room at Raffles.Excellent tea/coffee and superb fresh sandwiches served by attentive staff. Only downside was the visit by a bus load of Japanese tourists who transformed this classic experience into a coach tour like event. Shame, as had they appreciated that discretion was best we might have had a flawless "high tea " experience. Raffles should discourage bus tours but perhaps it's just good business!?Still a nice thing to have done whilst there, recommend you try it
4
The Tiffin Room used to be one of the highlights of my trips to Singapore. It still is very good. The room still splendid. But it is begining to loose its very special atmosphere. A little less selection, no more chutnies brought to the table in individual bowls, more easing of the dress code etc. Lots of little things but they all add up. Its always been expensive but it was worth it for the whole experience. This time as I got my bill I was left wondering if I should have left the T Room to the corporate night out tables and American tourists and spent the money on better curries elsewhere.Sorry if this sounds a bit negative but I loved the T Room and I think Singapore is close to losing something special
4
We were celebrating a special birthday and went to the Tiffin Room for the curry buffet. The food was excellent. Staff were lovely. They even brought out a birthday cake when they found out what we were celebrating. Expensive. The price of drinks was ridiculous - $45 for a glass of wine - we drank water. But you go for the atmosphere and the history. And it certainly has that.
5
Liked everything! Great service, great food! Don't miss having breakfast at Tiffin when staying at Raffles.
5
The service and the food here at the Indian buffet was first rate. It really brought back shades of the original era of Raffles hotel and I would recommend anyone coming here rather than the Long Bar which is manipulated into a tourist trap.
5
Great choice of breakfast and very good service in a beautiful setting. Nothing was too much trouble
5
Husband is an Eggs Benedict snob and was very happy with his dish, as was I with my poached eggs. Yum.

As everywhere in Singapore: sweet staff, but painfully slow and disorganized. They will offer you to refresh your tea, to which you must NEVER agree! They will take away your still warm tea pot with a promise of a fresh one, only to return 20 minutes later, after you inquire about it. This will leave you eating their lovely food while being thirsty. Napkins: Again, you are in Singapore!!! Do not expect to be offered a paper napkin. Just why? They are charging you so much, offering tea in silver teapots, yet they dont know that the linen napkin you put on your lap is to cover your lap, not to wipe your mouth??????????????Really really strange.If you do ask for it though, it will arrive in short 5 minutes and for free!! Wow, no napkin charge!Afternoon tea: nice, cute on silver platters, nice food, but nothing special or amazing. Just the way its presented is nice. Its quite crowded and a bit noisy. Its OK.Breakfast: I would come again. The food served for breakfast is EXCEPTIONAL. Extremely fresh, excellent choice, not the boring kind of breakfast, tons of fresh berries and great great smoothies, fantastic waffles and egg omelets (and I am not even an egg lover!) and great home-made jams, no kidding, they will have you eating just bread with the passion fruit mango jam or local kaya spread, how great it is. Again though: watch out for your tea being taken away and not being replaced for loooooong time.Dinner/Indian buffet:I love Indian food, but not in Raffles. The atmosphere was nice, they even had an Indian music playing and a really unusually nice and polite Indian young waiter, but honestly, as much as we have tried enjoying the food, it just was nothing special or un-usual, in fact, I have had much nicer elsewhere, for example Shangri-la Line Restaurnat Lunch Buffet. The only amazing thing was the roasted lamb which was so well baked that it literally melted on your tongue and the fact that they were knowlingly trying to stock you with fresh hot prata - which again, just like your teapot, dont!!! let them take away BEFORE!!! they replace it with the promised one. I failed on one occasion and was left with hot food getting cold without having a way to eat it (you just can enjoy Indian food without a prata, right?). This was for 15 minutes. Beware as the water served with the food is 15 sgd/bottle!Plus: eat your food quickly as it gets very cold too fast, because of the aircon.All in all: breakfast fantastic, the rest not worth the money. Music at dinner time could be louder as to beat the piano man from the lobby behind the corner. The air-conditioning should be warmer, its FREEZING COLD in Tiffin Room, bring a sweater if you are planning to stay longer than 20 minutes. Dress code: Just dont worry at all! People come dressed in sport shoes, shorts for breakfast, even slippers...anything is possible. A bit surprising

Had high tea at the Raffles with my sister. Overall the whole experience was fine, and the food they served was good. Service was good but they aren't attentive. Some of the staff seemed confused and they didn't really explain anything. It was really expensive at S$136 for two, but the colonial anbience with a harpist was what we paid for. Despite all this, I'm reluctant to return for tea as it seems overrated. Maybe for lunch or breakfast but not tea
2
I was so looking forward to having the famous high tea. What a disappointment. Service was appalling, surroundings where beautiful, food selection adequate. Expensive worked out just under 70aus ahead. Would I go back there no. Their service was dreadful, you requested a pot of tea, and you would die of thirst waiting for it. Tea quality was awful, I like strong tea, and they served it stewed, when I request a fresh pot, 30 mins later it arrived stewed again, so I gave up and just had water. Shame on you Tiffin Room, you need to get your act together

We've visited Singapore a number of times and always enjoy the street food. It is plentiful, inexpensive and delicious. Our lunch at Raffles was plentiful, expensive and delicious. We booked ahead (a good idea; we know people who've tried to get in at short notice and missed out), read up on the dress code (posh frock for her, long pants and collared shirt for him) and had a lovely lunch.Some reviews of the Tiffin Room say the food isn't spicy enough. It was pretty mild. But if you want hot food, go to Little India, not Raffles! I made up for the mildness by loading my plate with chilli pickles.The wonderfully elegant buffet tables offered soup, curries (vegetarian and non-vegetarian), condiments, salads, and some fabulous desserts. Raffles is a weird place to dine as there's a constant stream of tourists taking photos of the building and gardens.Nevertheless, a fun splurge
5
We recently stayed at Raffles Hotel and decided to book in for High Tea. I personally love high tea and was so excited about going to high tea in one of the world's most famous and iconic locations. It was very expensive ($SGD50 for 2 glasses of their standard champagne!), which was to be expected, but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The sandwiches were delicious and the famous scones were amazing. As soon as you ran out of sandwiches or cakes, you were offered a complimentary refill (which I suppose you would expect for the price, but not all high tea venues do this, so I was pleasantly surprised). The harp playing in the background was lovely, and we had a great afternoon
4
If you cannot afford to stay at this iconic Singapore hotel, the next best thing is to have a buffet breakfast at the Tiffin room and pretend you are a guest.We had stayed at Raffles a few years ago and remember fondly the wonderful variety and quality of breakfast available. We were given a gift voucher to spend at Raffles recently and decided to use it on breakfast this morning while we are staying in Singapore.You feel privileged to be allowed to enter through the front doors by warrior guards as you explain that you are here for breakfast. You can then pretend to be a guest and partake of the choice of a la carte hot breakfast, bottomless espresso, and all you can eat buffet. Choose from yum cha dumplings, cereals, cold meats, fruits, yoghurts, smoked salmon, poached eggs, salads,cheeses, freshly baked pastries and rolls and much more.The price for all of this is $53 per person which in Singapore is quite reasonable. Especially when the next best thing to do is have a sling at the Long Bar which will set you back almost $3
4
Excellent, costly as is everything in Raffles but for the experience 10/10. The service was very good and my business companion was impressed that places like this were still around
5
Sublime food, truly a "curry experience",
OK you will need a second mortgage to eat here, "it's not cheap" is the understatement of the century, but the quality of the food and the ambiance is truly superb. We will eat here again
3
Cannot believe that we were the only ones at lunch. It's a lovely place with good service. But guess the food is overpriced. Choices are limited too. Curries for S$60+++.... Guess people are smarter!!
4
Food selections are just excellent for the delicate palette. It's always a pleasure to dine at this place. Simply awesome
2
We had high expectations of this place. After reading about how fantastic their iconic high tea is we decided to book during our honeymoon in Singapore. The table was set nicely with rose petals for the occassion but the food and service was a complete let down. The sandwiches were dry and not fresh, the cakes were ok but not what I would expect from a top restaurant. I also hate the idea of a buffet for high tea-I didn't pay $75 + to line up with a plate while food is picked over by other diners. Nothing stood out and I have had far better afternoon tea-this surprisingly was the worst I had ever had
2
We were residents of the hotel and decided to have dinner at the Tiffin Room which was a terrible disappointment. We experienced very average food, well below average table settings, indifferent service and no music. The colonial architecture of the room is glorious but that is where the glory ends. This would have easily been the very worst meal of our entire two week holiday.I suspected we might be in for trouble when I noticed that the chair my mother was given was badly soiled. To the waiterâ€™s credit this chair was quickly replaced when it was pointed out. The experience didn't get any better from there. The table setting had garish polyester runners placed on the table cloths, tacky tea light containers and complete the whole dismal picture - the curry buffet was desperate.This is an expensive restaurant trading on the Raffles name that is to be avoided at all costs. You have been warne

We had been invited to the Raffles hotel for lunch and what should have been a delight was such a disappointment. Firstly, we had to get past the intimidating guard who asked us lots of questions about what we were doing and why we wanted to go inside the hotel? We were two young women in our best dresses - hardly a threat to anyone or undesirable types. Luckily we saw someone from our party inside and we were begrudgingly let in. While the Tiffin Room is beautiful and tastefully decorated, when we sat down we saw sloshes of curry sauce on the table cloth. I was embaressed for the person who had invited us for what should have been a special occasion. They had to ask for this to be replaced as it was not picked up by the waiter. Then our waiter disappeared to attend to another party of guests. We never saw him again and it was up to the poor sommelier to ensure that we had drinks and were catered for. He was the only one doing a good job. The buffet was nice and the Indian food is lovely. There is also a section of Indian sweets. Yet by this time, the sommelier's work was done so we had to ask for our coffees and teas. This meant getting up and finding someone to remind them that we would like a coffee and tea. We got coffee and they forgot the teas. The staff were more concerned with setting up the room for their high tea than the actual guests in the room who were overlooked. I was really surprised and shocked considering how much it costs to eat there. You are just paying for the beautiful surroundings ultimately. Save your money, have a singapore sling at the bar where you are welcomed and get a curry elsewhere where you are treated as a valued customer and guest. This is not the place
2
I have been to other high teas and afternoon teas and hands down, the quality of the food was just okay. We didn't really feel like getting refills from the buffet, not just because we were so full, but rather because the food was just okay. The service was much worse than expected. I was very excited while I was waiting outside and when I was ready to be seated. When my turn came, one of the staff members confirmed my reservation on the list and she liaised with another staff to take us to a table. Then the staff asks us, "How many of you? Do you have a reservation?" After we were seated, we realized there was no sugar pot and flower pot that were on other tables. In addition, silverware for one of us was missing! What is more, as the staff was taking too long to come take drink orders, I had to go and ask them if we were supposed to grab a drink on our own. Then she goes, "Oh, we come to the table. So do you want coffee or tea?" I had to tell her to come back when my company is back to the table. I expected the staff to be considerate and would actually come to the table and ask all of us for drink order when we are present. And just simple brewed coffee and tea! Solo kind. I had expected there would be a variety of teas and coffees. Honestly, I expected a lot higher for this place. I would choose another place for good high tea. One time visit for the sake of the experience at Raffles is enough

My family and I went to the Tiffin Room for High Tea - we had read so much about the history of Raffles prior to our trip and it seemed 'fitting'. High tea for 3 and a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar set us back over $350. Whilst the food was good, the setting lovely it still wasn't nearly enough to justify the ridiculous prices. Happy to have experienced, but wouldn't consider returning
5
Having already submitted a review for afternoon Tea in the Tiffin Room (which I must say was excellent) we had Breakfast here whilst staying at Raffles and the Buffet Breakfast was superb combining a great selection of Cereals, fruits, and a full English Breakfast which I managed each morning...fantastic and the staff new our names very morning to wish us a good morning! Offered my wife an American Paper and I the Singapore Straits Times. Service wonderful at all times
5
Best northern Indian curry buffet anywhere.
We never 'do' buffets, but this is different. Treat yourself, just make sure that you turn up hungry, or you'll regret it!
1
This is a famous hotel with high ranking but this Indian food buffet is horrible. food was old and cold. the price is high . the service attentive but not at this level
5
good food n good service.. Warmly welcomed , great staff paying gd attention to details in service , will come back
3
We visited raffles for afternoon tea sandwiches were plentiful and cakes lovely the buffet was a excellent bonus the ambience was calming with a lovely harpist playing. Service was ok .... Just ok isn't what you expect when at the raffles we had to keep asking them to top up our water and asking for more tea/coffee this needs to be addressed as let Raffles down shortly
3
The hotel is beautiful and the staff are excellent - everyone we met was professional, helpful and just perfect.But the afternoon tea is disappointing and nothing like the value and choice you get at many other hotels in Singapore.For $58++ we got 15 little sandwiches (replenished on demand), 9 cakes and 9 tiny biscuits. The buffet has tiny croque monsieur and curry puffs as well as dim sum - that was it for savory, the rest of the buffet table was cake and fruit.Champagne was $48 ++ for two glasses.It was very elegant - harpist playing beautifully during the tea, perfect service and simply lovely..but very poor value and the room was freezing.Lovely to do (once) but in future we'd return to the Shangri La or The Regent for their excellent value and choice.Raffles can and do charge a premium for afternoon tea and there is no doubt the setting is unbeatable - but not priceless
4
Tiffin room was a good surprise as it bought me back to the colonial british era where everything was white and the waitors dressed in white too. We did not do a reservation but walked in. there is a dress code as men cannot wear shorts. They have an amazing indian buffet spread and the reason i chose this place is for ambience, good spread for vegetarions and also located in Raffles hottel. The food was appetizing and tasty and i give 8 on 10 for the service
2
Nice colonial decor. The food, I am sorry to say, was tasteless. We noticed that many left food on their three tier stand. No choice of tea was offered. We weren't impressed at all. We traveled aboard the Eastern and Oriental Express last year and this was classy and tasty. Tiffin Room High Afternoon Tea, I will not recommend to anyone
3
Like many of the previous reviewers my wife and I had been looking forward to afternoon tea in the Tiffin Room. We were allowed access early as a long queue had formed. first impressions were good with tables well laid out and a harpist playing quietly in the background. Sandwiches and cakes on the table were very average for any afternoon tea, the cakes were the same. Tea and coffee were slow in being replenished and the hot dishes were very limited in choice. Fresh fruit was nice but the highlight for me was the bread and butter pudding. It was delicious.All in all, at £ 30 per person, overpriced, overrated experience. We would not go back or recommend the experience to anyone else

Visited recently and was underwhelmed by the dining. The food was buffet style, and was all pretty bland. The dishes were not fresh and had been standing for too long, especially the rice which was dry and hard where it had stood for so long. Asked for mann bread and was told it was coming, got Roti at the end of the meal. The drinks are very expensive a 300Ml Kingfisher is £10 each. Desserts were really poor just a load of chopped fruit, which was actually nearly empty of pineapple etc. 2 people £150 was a ridiculous. I would suggest going to the Ritz as the buffet is as good if not better for indian food, PLUS you get a lot of other choices. The service was pretty good. Will NOT be returning, massively disappointed

Visiting this iconic hotel during a stay in Singapore is a must. We had afternoon tea at the Tiffin Room booked. When we arrived we were directed around the side of the building, the main hotel is for guests staying only. Around the side we had to queue until the room opened at 3pm. I had informed the staff before we arrived that I had an allergy to oranges, which they acknowledged on arrival. The afternoon tea had some orange on one cake I was not given an alternative and when eating the cakes i discovered that one of the other cakes had orange peel in it. Yes the staff apologized but didn't replace the cake for another. The buffet section was good but some of the food seemed a little overbaked, the sandwiches were just ok. The floral decorations of orchids (of course for Singapore) were wilting and it just felt that overall the place is living on reputation rather than being known as an institution that has impeccable service and traditions. We decided to go to the Long bar for a Singapore Sling which was a better experience. Obviously Raffles is an iconic hotel in Singapore and a must see but for the price of the afternoon tea and dress code restrictions (which were not followed by all who were there) I was expecting a higher quality of food, general presentation of the hotel and attentiveness of staff. I would have expected replacement cakes for my allergy at the very least. Overall I was disappointed
2
The location and room was very nice but the buffet was not to the standard expected of its reputation. The food tasted average and felt that it had been prepared and reheated or had stood for quite a while. Disappointed.

Going to the Tiffin Room was going to be one of our most eagerly anticipated highlights of our far eastern holiday to celebrate our 50th birthdays within weeks of each other. We booked over the internet, weeks in advance, for high tea at 4 pm and explained it was for a 50th birthday treat First impressions of the Raffles hotel were favourable - it's a beautiful, old colonial building.However, arriving outside the Tiffin room at 3.45 we came to an empty lectern, so we had to wait til a staff member noticed us and came over. Upon me saying my name she looked at her list and said 'ah Mr Hall, we've been waiting for you ' (we were early?)She took us into the beautiful room and we were seated at a table for 3 and we were told about the buffet etc. Sandwiches and cakes rapidly appeared and were tasty, we all had tea which was lovely, however, our server appeared to rapidly lose interest in us. No more tea was forthcoming, until we asked, whereas other tables nearby (with different servers) were refilled rapidly, without bidding.We ended up asking a server detailed to other tables for more tea - he was pleasant and polite and brought us a teapot, instead of just pouring a small cupful for each of us, this was better, but it was quite annoying we'd had to try so hard for more tea. Just before 5pm, as tables began to empty, the staff put most effort into getting those tables turned around for the evening trade, they all appeared to lose interest in the customers still present.At this point I went to the restroom - I've been to cleaner public toilets! On returning to the Tiffin room, I noticed a sign saying high tea was served til 5.30 , this surprised me as we all felt by 5 pm we had outstayed our welcome. We tried to attract staff members attention, eventually we paid our £86 bill. (high tea for two adults and a child) and left. We left feeling very let down - we'd hoped for exemplary service and ended up feeling we were a nuisance, just for asking for more tea. Doubtful we will ever return.

Went there for the dinner buffet on a weekday evening. I sampled virtually all the dishes on offer in the buffet spread and my view is that the dishes here represent a delicious but "lite" version of Indian cooking. On one hand the fieryness in the curries have definitely been toned down significantly from what you get in India/Kashmir or Singapore. I did not even break out into a sweat after having multiple curries which is very unusul by my own standards. On the other hand, the light hand in the use of oil, cream and chillies really allows the rest of the spices used in each dish to shine through. Some warm dishes are served directly to your table. A good selection of desserts is available - try the gulab jamun in saffron sugar syrup and the rice pudding (kheer).Service is outstanding as to be expected from this hotel. The setting and ambience is terrific and suitable for special occassions or for business meals. For more casual outings you can find better value elsewhere in Singapore. Singapore has a wide selection of mid-range eateries serving delicious Indian food
5
Even though, this restaurant is a bit expensive, (of course it is, in the Raffles Hotel.. :) we have been to the Tiffin Room for the Indian buffet dinner twice already. The food is outstanding the service is excellent... We will definitely be back. It can be a bit chilly inside due to the air conditioning, so do bring a shoal :
5
Breakfast in the Tiffin Room is as much an experience as everything else at the Raffles. The room itself is charming and the buffet spread, beautiful. You have choices of fruit, yogurt, dumplings, AND/NOT OR, anything you wish to order, omelets, bacon, Eggs Benedict, you name it. Service is exceptional, as is the overall ambience
4
Most of the reviews relating to the Tiffin Room at Raffles relate to afternoon tea but we sampled their dinner buffet.The restaurant was quiet when we arrived at 7:30pm but it gradually filled up as the evening progressed. The buffet selection features a choice of four meat and vegetarian options for both starter and main course. We tried a good variety and all were delicious. It was great to experience curries without the overdose of cream that often drowns those of offer in the UK.A selection of signature dishes are also brought to your table during the course of the meal including naan bread. Poppadoms and chutneys are available as part of the buffet.A selection of hot and cold desserts round off the buffet. The raisin ice cream was particularly good.At SGD75 per person, the buffet is good value. Drinks are expensive, however. A service charge is added to the bill. Service is polite, efficient and unobtrusive. The waiting staff are pleased to explain how the buffet works and answer questions on the dishes on offer
5
We had a two night stay over in Singapore after a cruise before we flew back. My wife booked it for us and it was an inspired decision.It was just like you would expect in the days of colonial Britain with silver service and crisp white table cloths (it was an experience watching them change a table cloth without revealing the actual table underneath !)Our waiter looked after us like royalty and we had a harpist playing right next to us.There were three tier plate stands on the table which was enough but we were then directed to the buffet !Needless to say we didn't need an evening meal after we had finished off !Its well worth the cost and you must book up before hand to ensure you get a place
4
We were staying at the hotel and had breakfast included. The choices and service was very nice but I feel it could've been better. We are coffee snobs and I always feel that these 5 star properties are not using the best coffee available. If I can get good coffee at Starbucks the hotel should have much better coffee for the high prices paid
5
We visited the Tiffin Room for dinner when they had a North Indian curry buffet.The room - in the Raffles - is lovely and reminiscent of colonial times past. All very white and crisp.The staff were very attentive and helped make the experience memorable.The food was more than curry but there was a good selection of curries available. Lots of accompaniments and lots of choice of hot and cold food. And, being a buffet, we got to try most of the dishes - only small servings of each, obviously!It's not cheap but then again nothing at the Raffles is cheap. It's well worth paying just for the experience, though
4
Busy traditional afternoon tea. A mixture of sandwiches, cakes, dim sum and curry pastries. Lovely setting, very popular so definitely need to book. Additionally there are some great shops, the long bar and a very nice bar outside so you can spend the whole afternoon here. £35 per head I thought was pretty good.
4
The service is attentive and high quality, as one should expect at the high-costing original Raffles Hotel. For a greater range of good food on the buffet line, go across the street to Prego.
5
Just Awesome indian food and good sweets ..liked kashmiri mutton very well. Ambience is royal and reminds of typical colonial era.
5
All very proper and fab as you would expect .... Non stop cakes and sandwiches. Try the home made truffles ...
5
Great selection of northern Indian dishes. Save some room for desserts. The salads are fresh, condiments are so inviting, curries are very aromatic and the Tandoori Chicken is just something that you dont want to miss. I just loved it.
4
On our last day in Singapore, we decided to treat ourselves to the legendary tiffin lunch on Saturday at the famous Raffles Hotel.The service is outstanding: attentive, warm and hospitable and typical of Filipino serving staff.Extensive range of Indian curries and condiments, but strictly tailored to Western tastes to the point of blandness in some dishes. The sweets were outstanding with a delicious house made pistachio kulfi and about ten different classic Indian sweets to die for. Go for the experience at S$120.00 each for the buffet
5
We turned up without a booking and were prepared to wait 30-40 minutes, but there was a no-show and we got in about 10 minutes later. We had had the High Tea a few years ago, and this time we were better informed as to what was available, so we were able to take full advantage. Following other reviewers' experience, we declined the offer of a glass of champagne (which we didn't need anyway). The selection of hot and cold items was extensive enough for our tastes and was delicious. We had some of each, followed by fruit. Service was excellent, attentive and friendly and we were very happy with the whole experience
4
The interior decor is cool, soothing and classic making a peaceful ambiance. There is live harp playing in the Tiffin Room, which is the highlight. Included with the three tier sandwiches and cakes is the buffet with hot and cold offerings. Loved the savoury scones in particular. All the food was attractively presented and tasty. It is expensive (champagne is extra) and you do need to line up if you wish to go in at opening time, but the line is dealt with very quickly. Another icon of Singapore tried and enjoyed
3
The Tiffin Room is very popular with either corporate folks at lunch or guests of the hotel. The ambiance is beautiful and the staff are very friendly. However,I have amamzing meals on some occassions and really ordinary meals on the other occasion. We went there for their diwali lunch expecting an array f authentic dishes but were very sadly disappointed. The food has been tempered down to suit the western palette and as such I feel for the price you are bing charged there are other nicely appointed indian restaurants in town you could visit.
4
We had the buffet curry lunch. Although the restaurant is not big the buffet had a good selection of choices. All the food we tried was excellent! The service was good even down to getting me a little chair to put my hand bag on and ordering us fresh nam bread when we started our main meal. The only annoying thing was the price of drinks. 500ml of bottled water was over $13 which is a bit on the steep side. Lovely hotel and grounds to experience

Pre booked high tea at Raffles hotel in advance.On arrival we were told to form a line before we could enter like we were at school. Dress standards that this hotel has prided itself in was non existent. A group of Chinese people complete with back packs looking like they had just come from the beach, men in non tailored shorts completed with trainers and several men in t shirts that I would not let my husband garden in we're evident. The staff were attentive as they showed us to our table which had been shoe horned into the room due to the mass of people. The noise was deafening due to the close proximity of tables which made any conversation with my husband difficult.I have taken many high teas around the world and this was was very unusual in that we asked to join a line to go through a buffet. This consisted of little pies, scones, cake, and the unusual side dish of Chinese take away! And bread and butter pudding. The majority of this was not deemed as high tea in my eyes. We did however have a cake stand brought to us which consisted of the customary small sandwiches and fancy cakes. Tea and coffee was served however we had to repeatedly ask for a refill. The sandwiches had obviously been prepared hours in advance as they were dry and un appetising. All in all the occasion did not live up to expectations and my husband did mention if a Chinese was available then why wasn't there a chicken madras and nan bread available as clearly this was a ridiculous attempt at something that is mastered in most places around the world except Raffles
5
Eight of us were booked for afternoon tea at Raffles, a once in a lifetime visit. Food was delicious and plenty of it, service was excellent.
5
The food served in the Tiffin Room was marvellous, afternoon tea was like a trip back in time with the service and quality. Even if you are not staying at Raffles Hotel, visit the Tiffin Room and be treated to an absolutely delightful experience.

หัวละ 53++ เหรียญสิงคโปร์ก็ถือว่าคุ้มมากสำหรับ afternoon tea ที่นี่มี three-tiered tray และบุฟเฟ่ต์ที่ประกอบไปด้วยพัฟเพสทรี่ ติ่มซำ ผลไม้ all you can eatรสชาติ และหน้าตาอาหารและขนม ... ปกติ ไม่จี๊ด ไม่ได้น่าตื่นเต้นมาก บริการก็ตามสไตล์จีนๆ แขกๆ คือ รีบไปหมด ไม่รู้จะรีบไปไหน สงสัยทำเวลาสำหรับฝรั่งอย่างไรคงต้องมาเพราะถือเป็น legendary high tea ของประเทศเมืองขึ้นเครือจักรภพ เป็นจุดต้นกำเนิดของ "สิงคโปร์สลิง" สำหรับคนไทยที่เคยนึกถึงสิงคโปร์แต่ด้านความทันสมัย แหล่งช็อป ทิฟฟิ่นเป็นทางเลือกที่ดี เพราะเดินออกไปหน่อยตรง Raffles Courtyard ก็มีร้านเพียบเขาเป๊ะเรื่องเวลานะจ๊ะ จองกี่โมงอย่าได้สาย และแต่งตัวเรียบร้อยสักนิด แตะ ห้าม! ขาสั้น ไม่ต้อนรับ! แต่ดีตรงนี้ ได้ไปถ่ายรูปสวย

We decided that as we had a day stopover in Singapore we would treat ourselves to High tea at Raffles. It was to be a nostalgic visit by my husband who had visited the hotel in 1963 when it was near the beach! I too was keen to see it as my mother had been there in the past too.We booked the tea online and received a charming email with details of dress code etc.When we arrived the doors of our Taxi were opened with style and we went to the side entrance to the Tiffin for high tea.We were made welcome and shown to our table which was lovely and the colonial styling was a real treat. We went to the buffet where we sampled some of the many delicacies from the choices available. when we returned to our table there was a cake stand with a delightful selection of sandwiches and exquisite cakes. We were given a choice of tea or coffee. then we were offered a glass of champagne which though expensive was a nice addition to our high tea experience.While we enjoyed our tea there was a lady playing the harp. This really made it a romantic occasion for us. Our waitress kindly took photos of us which was very kind off her.The only slight complaint we had was that when the bill came we were asked if we had flown via Singapore Airline. To which we replied that we had and were flying with them the next day.She asked if we had our boarding passes or tickets as we could have a discount if we had them. When we said we had the email on the iPhone we were told it had to be the hard copy! This upset us as there had been no mention of this on their email to us. So if you do go enjoy and take your airline tickets or boarding passes so you may get a discount!We would recommend it as a romantic interlude in Singapore.

Have been to several high tea spaces in five star hotels, Tiffin Room could be one of special ones. The interior decoration is decent and classic make ambiance here very gentle. There is live harp playing in Tiffin Room , which is the highlight. As for food, frankly they are generally okay. Coffee is ordinary, and you have to pay extra to have a glass of champagne. Butter cream and jam for scone are better than scone itself. Sandwich tastes better than they look , especially ones with eggs and cucumber. Pastry is very ordinary and I didn't want to finish it. They also provide dim sum, however, I would not feel like to try it here. Waitress who served us had very professional smile and proper manner, however, losing eye contacts with customers (us) while talking to us made us feel very weird and lacked of respect, which I did not expect it would happen at five star hotel. I would say have an experience for once is good enough.

Visited Tiffin for high tea on a weekend visit to Singapore. Beautiful setting without a doubt and nice to see some of the famous hotel. Went with a group of five and had a great time. Included with the three tier sandwiches and cakes is the buffet with hot and cold offerings. Loved the curried chicken pies, and the Victoria sponge with lemon curd to die for. Sandwiches were great, especially the egg, though must admit was not fussed with the cakes but who cares when there are scones to be had. Our waiter was fantastic, and we received another plate of sandwiches, so you don't go hungry. Glass of champagne is $23 per person, all up came to $96 each. While in Singapore, certainly worth the visit
4
I visited with a group for the evening buffet. This was excellent and very good value for money. My table witnessed and extraordinary piece of theft. At the next tabe a lady wearing a sari had brought in a bag full of empty tupper ware boxes which she proceeded to fill with food taken from the buffet. This seemed to me to be bad behaviour
4
My man brought me here for a calming session of tea before I head off to battle (exam). The place was gorgeous. Dark furniture against marble flooring and white pillared walls. Old fashioned ceiling fans and a classy dark-wood Peranakan showcase cabinet, which sat quietly behind the buffet, housing a lovely collection of vintage tiffin carriers... felt a bit like we'd gone back in time to the Colonial era to sip tea pinky-aloft... :)As expected, you get good "Raffles class" services. The dim sum wasn't fantastic, but let's not be like those who'd go to Europe and complain how don't make "proper" Chinese rice… This is western tea, not "yum-cha"… We each got our little pot of good tea and the pastry was delicious. You get proper cream and bread & butter pudding. There was also a cute little chair for your posh handbags - savvy girls know placing your handbags on the floor = not a lady.We also enjoyed the live harp music, which was very soothing. However, some people need to leave the pretty harpist alone. Stop snapping close-up pictures with that big dumb iPad. They look like they had disturbed the diners at the table beside the harp.Also, there should perhaps be an age limit on patrons. Having children running around the tables was simply annoying... I have two children, so I know it is abnormal to force energetic toddlers to sit through tea sessions - they'd feel bored (technically that is "child abuse"). Perhaps better to go for a picnic and run with them in a park. Hmm… lazy parents spotted? Or too selfish to even make a small gastronomical sacrifice to wait for their tots to grow up a bit before bringing them to places like the Tiffin Room? Sadly, the self-indulgence need to pig seemed to over-rule the risk of hot teapots toppling over their misbehaving young

On a recent family trip to Singapore we decided to treat ourselves to High tea at the Tiffin Room at Raffles. We enjoyed the old world charm of Raffles combined with excellent service and a good choice of sandwiches, cakes etc served at the table and scones, fruit, dim sum, etc on the buffet tables. The waiter was very attentive and even accompanied the children to the buffet and served them their choices there. Whilst not cheap, the prices are comparable to what one would pay at any decent hotel in London. I recommend it if you are looking for something a bit out of the ordinary
5
Visited last August. Having experienced the very fine dining at Raffles Grill and the opposite experience at The Courtyard we were nervous at Tea. We should not have worried as Tea was excellent. Very nice elegant surroundings. Very good service - Tea was perfect, very nice selection of sandwiches and scones. We really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it
5
We had lunch here to have the “Raffles experience” during our 24 hour stay.
A buffet of spicy hors d'oeuvres and main courses followed by sweetmeats for dessert, accompanied by a Singapore Sling, it didn’t disappoint.
5
Staff were attentive, friendly and helpful. Delightful surroundings. Sensory experience. Food excellent.
5
Service second to none,eggs cooked to perfection in any way you choose,beautiful restaurant,atmosphere. Perfect way to start the day!

Somebody didn't check the definition of high tea - which is certainly not the image they want at Raffles.I have always been a fan of Raffles and their fabulous dining outfits but this month I had a pretty ordinary tea: dry old sandwiches and terrible cakes of bizarre flavour combinations such as earl grey, raspberry and chocolate in the one cake. Mango pudding cake doesn't really work. The tarts were ordinary.The cakes in general, with the exception of the Victoria lemon sponge, get a F for FAIL. The hot buffet and scones were quite good. I hope it improves, especially for the price. The Tiffin Room is as beautiful as ever, it's a shame to have such a poor afternoon tea. Again, it's not a high tea! I expect Raffles to know the difference - you wouldn't see such an gauche error at The Savoy or The Rit
2
The Old World atmosphere inside the Raffles Hotel is something for every tourist to experience. The Long Bar pleases, so do Ah Teng Bakery and Royal China so I very much looked forward to trying high-tea at the Tiffin Room. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. THough we had confirmed reservations, we were made to wait 15 minutes for our table. Tables are cramped together, straining conversations. The savories are dry and the desserts unappetizing. There is a discord between the stately venue and the meal experience-- what an upset
5
I visited Singapore on my own en route to visit family in Australia, and wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to visit the iconic Raffles Hotel for High tea. The tea was Christmas themed, featuring a spiced cranberry jam alongside the scones, gingerbread, tiny mince pies, Christmas pudding, a champagne roulade and a glorious chocolate shoe amongst the delicacies on offer. As a solo diner, it isn't uncommon to be shoved in a corner and forgotten about a bit, but that certainly wasn't the case here, where the table was fabulous, the service extremely courteous with prompt replenishment of my teapot. As well as the three-tiered stand (which contains a two person serving if you're on your own!), there are also tables serving additional savoury and sweet pastries, desserts, dim sum and exotic fruit. Simply wonderful.I've recommended it to several family members and friends who've been out since,and won't hesitate to visit it again, maybe for the curry buffet next time
4
The Tiffin Room’s curry buffet is well renowned so we thought we should dine here while staying at Raffles and we very pleased we did. The setting is beautiful and, on the night we were there, not very busy. If you book for early in the evening (7 or 7.30pm), you may well find yourselves the only patrons, as we did, though more people did gradually arrive over the next hour or two.Although there was a good range of dishes, I was expecting a larger choice. Still, you certainly wouldn’t go hungry and there was plenty to tempt all palates. Several additional ‘tasting’ dishes were also offered to us at our table during the meal and these were just as delicious as the rest of the food. The service, as always at Raffles, was excellent.One criticism I do have is that there appeared to be no drinks menu. When I asked if I could see it to decide which of their selection of beers I wanted to choose, they said they didn’t have one but named several choices. I like to be able to decide with a menu in front of me. Apart from that small thing, I can’t really fault the experience and would definitely go again, given the opportunity
2
Years ago, tea in the Tiffin Room of the Raffles Hotel was an unforgettable experience. A sumptuous buffet offered delicacies from at least three cuisines--Chinese, Malay, Indian--and possibly more. And partisans of each, no doubt, could be found among the patrons. Today, the diners are much less heterogeneous, the offerings brought to the table on a trite tea-stand are almost uniformly mediocre, and the elegant damask chairs are, often as not, stained. One pays a princely sum for this experience, and the whole thing, replete with traveling British choristers drowning out he room's resident pianist, is dishearteningly dreary. The Qatari outfit that has assumed ownership of this legendary hotel certainly knows how to squeeze the last drop of life out of a brand.
2
I would say if we had let it, it would have ruined our special 70th birthday celebrations but we didn't rise to the snooty staffs level!The staff in the hotel were full of their own importance and look down on the customers, why book a table for afternoon tiffin only to then stand in a queue with everyone else for 30 minutes in the heat whilst they seated everyone. Once inside the food was ok and the service redeemed by 1 waitress in particular, but had this not been the case our special day would have been ruined.Normally known for good service in Singapore we couldn't fault everywhere else we visited just the "iconic" raffles who are guaranteed tourist. Personally we felt the Fullerton Hotel was better standard of food and service.Next visit to Singapore will not include a trip to raffles, I guess they don't need repeat business as they certainly don't seem bothered about making the right impression
4
We went off to the Tiffin Room at the Raffles for high tea. we were shown into the most beautiful dining area. The building itself is stunning and is a trip back to yesteryear. There is a buffet of food as well as a three tier plate of sandwiches and cakes on your table together with jam and clotted cream. There is a lady playing a harp in the background. It is one of those things you would experience once or if you had a special occation. its not the cheapest although the nieces enjoyed getting all dressed up and the unlimited cakes for two hours. We had a lovely afternoon
4
Indian dinner buffet delicious. Great service again. Indian dinner buffet delicious. Great service again. Indian dinner buffet delicious.

Every bit as good as the reviews say it is, and then some. A Singapore institution. Book in advance as it is always busy.

When in Singapore, one must visit Raffles Hotel. Alas, it is not open to visitors, so the only option left is to eat there. I would never recommend Raffles Grill, a very expensive and rather snobbish place with French cuisine, but Tiffin Room is another story. It offers buffet lunch or dinner with North Indian food at quite reasonable process (if there are any reasonable prices in Singapore). The food is excellent and the service top class – all of that in marvellous colonial interior of Raffles Hotel. We do it every time when visiting Singapore. Highly recommended

Went here on my 40th birthday and were shown into the dining area to a lovely table for two by the window after the staff checked off our reservation. We were served coffee and tea (own preference), the tea being exclusive to The Raffles, and we got a three tier stand of sandwiches, different cakes and tarts. There was also a buffet style area with dim sums, scones, tarts and other savoury and sweets. We were also offered to buy champagne with our meal and we chose to do so. The sandwiches were lovely, and so were the dim sums. I think the scones were a bit dry but the rest of the tarts and cakes were also nice but not exceptional. I was so full before I had even tried half of it and then the lovely staff came out with a big cake for me for my birthday. I did eat a bit and so did hubby but we were both so full we couldn't eat another bite. They did offer to put it in a box for us to take away but we declined as we were leaving the next day. It was just lovely, the best celebration of a 40th but in saying that I don't think I will go back. It is one of THE things to do in Singapore but it is a classic high tea with finger sandwiches and mini tarts with tea at a very high price (ended up at $190 for two). There are so many other places to try out there
4
We took breakfast here during our four night stay at the Raffles Hotel and it really was a very good experience. The choice of food at the morning buffet was enormous and it all looked so fresh and inviting with lots of baked on the day breads and pastries and a great choice of freshly prepared hot food as well. The service was quite impeccable with helpful staff and willing smiles throughout the service. We didn't dine here in the evening but the restaurant ambiance would certainly have been a pleasant one judging by our breakfast experience. A high standard for others to emulate
5
We had been warned about the expense but it is one of those bucket list things. It happened to be my birthday, we had booked High Tea (or tiffin) 2 weeks earlier and were shown to a table near the harpist. We were entranced by the décor the lovely table settings and the politely attentive staff.The food was delicious and entirely what we had been expecting.After we had eaten and had refills of champagne and tea, we heard the harpist playing "happy birthday" and 3 staff bought over a cake and wished me happy birthday!It was so lovely and a perfect birthday trea
5
Another Raffles Restaurant that showpieces the hotel. Whether early morning breakfast (usually fairly quiet) to "high tea" which is more chaotic the staff maintain a calm exterior, unflappable good humour and great friendliness. The breakfast has a wide choice from cold cuts, cereals, pastries, some Chinese dishes and an a la carte menu includes a bento box.Fruit juices are freshly prepared.High Tea is an elegant feast. It given warning, the kitchen will cater for food allergies.We have eaten the Evening Curry buffet on past trips, again a good repast -but not recent enough to give a current review
4
Excellent food, decent spread, tasty food, and of course the Dining room that reminds you of the days of yore are the plus points for Tiffin Room at The Raffles, Singapore.Apart from which the staff was extremely slow (perhaps more attentive towards the Europeans which was evidently visible), the vegetarian options were almost extinct. An amazing concierge Samriddhi or Sam as she's known there guided us well on the reservation of the table and the hotel in general. Kudos to her.. Rest of the staff was very lame and slow to the core. The table we were allotted were by the deal wall side (despite booking it 24 hours prior). Good experience but the staff need to know how to be on toes big time !!! One always thinks twice to step in again, with that kind of bad service
5
We had a booking at the Raffles for 3pm and it was everything we expected,starting with the doorman complete with turban,the tea had wonderful sandwiches and cakes that were replenished when they were eaten ,there was also a buffet of hot foods and more cakes ,it is not a cheap tea cost is $ 68 aud plus $25aud for a glass of champagne but when we come back to Singapore we will do it all again
2
Booked a table for 1.30pm. On arrival told that the buffet would close at 2pm. This was not mentioned on booking.Only 10 other people already there.We hurriedly chose savoury food. The food was good but the hot dishes were not hot, only just warm.At 1.55 we were told that the dessert table would be cleared in 5 minutes so chose our desserts which were very nice but had no chance to go for second helpings.We paid SGD176 for 2 meals and a bottle of sparkling water.The service was only mediocre, the staff being preoccupied with preparing the tables around us for the afternoon tea which was to start at 3pm.We felt that we were a nuisance and hated the way we had to rush what should have been a very pleasant experience.We did not enjoy the experience at all.For a leisurely lunch, I would recommend that people book tables no later than 12.30 to give them time to enjoy the environment and the food
5
The Tiffin Room was where I sat for high tea.The staff were so very attentive and made this special day even more special
5
A visit to Singapore is not proper without taking high tea in the Tiffin room. It's expensive but highly worthwhile. An indulgence with nice little sandwich and cakes, though if you have the champaign ask them to fill your glass full else you will pay about £20 for half a glass. Finish it off in the courtyard bar with a Singapore sling, it's a bucket list tick for sure. A must do, must see, must go.Jamie of wisbec

Have just returned From an afternoon at the acclaimed raffles hotel in singapore and I have to say that a jolly good time was had by all.At the entrance we were greeted by an impressive looking fellow in a turban and shown round to the tiffin room entrance ( only residents allowed in the main entrance, stops oggling tourists).We were seated at a tab!e right next to a lady playing a harp, and were asked if we would like tea, coffee or champagne, unsurprisingly the Mrs went for the bubbly stuff.After that a three tier assortment of sandwiches, cakes and tartlets was brought to the table, also available was a hot buffet section with dumplings and other savoury Whatnots.The tea and coffee were kept topped up throughout as was the three tier thing, we were constantly asked if we wanted more.The price of high tea was 58 dollars each plus the usual taxes and the bubbly was 23 dollars a glass.Now im sure some of you reading this will have possibly had palpitations at this, and I was thinking its a bit steep but if you factor the two hours of attentive but not rushing you out the door service, the excellent quality of the food and the bubbles ( made exclusively for them apparently ), the atmosphere and where it actually is , also it is touristy then its not that bad in my book. Plus if you have an HSBC debit or visa card and use that to pay they take 20% off , that makes it a bit better ( or more bubbles as the boss said ).There is a listed dress code, collared t shirts or shirts with trousers for the chaps and dresses for the ladies but to be honest its obviously not enforced as was evident by the rather large bloke in a shirt and board shorts with flip flops who constantly tapped at his Mac and used his mobile !!!I'm no clothes model, I only really dress up for weddings and funerals but made the effort today, a shame some others didn't !!!!!!All in all we really enjoyed it, yes it wasn't cheap but was very enjoyable all the same and will be considered a treasured memory of the holiday ...

I had high tea at the tiffin room it's something not to be missed. The food was so yummy. If the high tea is not enough you can help yourself to the Buffett which has more sweets and savoury food selection. The staff were very friendly and took lots of photos for me and I even got a picture with the famous bell man. I will back to enjoy the high tea next year,I simply cannot wait.

We spent 3 days in Singapore and just had to sample the High Tea at Raffles before leaving. We were fortunate enough to get a booking, even though our South African Rand made the event hugely expensive for the two of us. We decided that it wasn't about the money it was about the experience and to hell with it ;-)In a typical bygone era of English Colonial style we were served by waiters in bright white jackets and fresh clean white gloves. Tablecloths starched and silver polished, dead on 3pm the tea was served. Tables had a serving of neatly trimmed sandwiches and small delicacies. We were then invited to help ourselves to the copious amounts of pie, cake, fruit and dim sum, quite a mixture! All freshly baked and made it was difficult not to try and try and try to eat some more ;-)Highly recommendable and in such a lavish, lush surrounding. DIVINE

We visited Raffles for high tea and were treated exceptionally well by the lovely staff. We were plied with tea, which was much appreciated after 7 weeks travelling. There was a buffet selection of dumplings, savoury and sweet snacks and cakes. Obviously we helped ourselves to these wonderful delights but then more treats came our way, beautifully cut sandwiches and cakes, lots of cakes. They even had little chairs to put our bags on, a great touch. A must for anyone visiting Singapore

High Tea at Raffles, followed by cocktails in the Long Bar - this was something on our bucket list.You must book for High Tea, several people were turned away in front of us. Doors to the Tiffin Room don't open until just after 3pm so there is a queue at the door. There was loads of food, we over ate and ended up feeling very full. The savoury buffet and scones were divine, but we did not enjoy the other sweets as much as those served at Afternoon Tea at our hotel, the Conrad, so that was a little dissapointing. We also did not realise that in addition to the extortionate charge there is tax and service charge to be added, which makes a huge hole in the wallet. Having said that, it is worth doing, but not worth repeating. Do carry on to the Long Bar for early evening drinks and complemantary peanuts, though service in the Long Bar was a bit busy and slow

We booked this 3 weeks before as advised and received an email to say we should be there at 1pm. We did not need to give any credit card details. So, after a morning in Chinatown, we rushed back to our hotel to have a shower and get changed and got a taxi to Raffles hotel. On arrival we were told that it was not possible for us to have a reservation for 1pm as the afternoon tea does not start till 3pm. After some deliberation, we were told that it was their mistake (fortunately we had the email on a phone so we had proof) and they said we would have to return at 3pm. They were fully booked but we were assured that a table would be made available.Off we went to pass two hours and returned at 3pm. The front of Raffles hotel is very impressive and we were directed around the building where we had to queue. It reminded me a bit of having to queue for school dinners and was a lot different from our afternoon tea in Dubai at the Burj al Arab where we were made to feel special and treated individually. Even so, we enjoyed it very much. We were shown to a table and told to help ourselves from the buffet. I found it a bit too much to have a traditional afternoon tea and a buffet as well. There was just too much food. Of course that is not a criticism, just my preference would have been to just have the usual sandwiches, scones and cakes. My son enjoyed the buffet and had various dumplings with chicken and shrimp etc. We were asked if English breakfast tea was ok and as we said yes, I don't know if there was an alternative. A tiered stand was brought with various sandwiches and we were told we could ask for more of anything we wanted. We ordered some more sandwiches which seemed to take a long time to arrive but were very nice. The scones, jam and cream were nice as were the little cakes but some of the chocolate ones were quite rich - not a complaint. The service was good and friendly and there was a harpist playing just behind us which was a nice touch. It was well worth doing but not in the same league as the tea we had in Dubai which I have to say was more than twice the price so not really a fair comparison.I would say definitely do this when in Singapore but maybe go elsewhere for a Singapore sling if cost is an issue. We got one at a bar during happy hour for $8 (half normal price and maybe a third or even a quarter of the Raffles price). Definitely one of those memorable occasions

I didn't stay at Raffles but did stop by for a Singapore sling and for Afternoon tea. The slings are done beautifully and taste great but it will cost you around £15 for the pleasure. You will probably need to prebook afternoon tea in the Tiffin room, and you can have this with or without champagne. The tea consists of two parts - a classic tea stand with sandwiches, scones and cakes and then a hot buffet with more desserts and some savoury options. You'll get more out of it if you're not a vegetarian, as although they brought veggie sandwiches, most of the savoury hot food was meat/fish. However there is such a lot of food, I couldn't have eaten more, if i'd wanted to! The room is a grand colonial style room with a harpist and although it has lots of tables, you don't feel too squeezed in. They provided some magazines on the table as I was eating alone, which was a nice touch, even if I was too busy people watching to read them! (It is definitely somewhere where you do stand out going on your own, as most people are celebrating something in couples or groups). The service was ok, but not as good as I expected. I had to flag down waiters a number of times to get top up hot water or more tea, and remind them when they then forgot. It is worth the money because it's something classic to do whilst in Singapore, but I'm not sure I'd need to go again

I had made a reservation to the Tiffin room as part of a romantic day in Singapore several weeks before my actual visit. I wanted to show my girlfriend exactly what great service was and as just a good place historic place to walk around in and get a feel for the old city. Sadly, I was unaware that the "return to a classic time" was very literal. Before I get to the gist of my complaints which involve the service, I will say that the food was good if nothing truly of note. We had much better curries in Little India the next day, but we were really not there for the food other than the raved about Nan, rather for the service and the feel of the restaurant.Before I continue, I will say that both my girlfriend and I are Asian and that the other table I will be talking about was a Caucasian foursome that sat next to us.When we first arrived at the restaurant (which was relatively empty) I requested a table by the window. The host at first told us that all the window tables were occupied when clearly there were several that were not. When I noted this, he said that those tables had been reserved so I pointed out that I had made my reservation over two weeks ago for a window seat. At which point he finally relented and sat us down. No other patrons would occupy those "reserved" window tables the entirety of our meal. After sitting down, the host simply left without bringing us a wine list or drink menu at all and we had to later flag down a waiter for simply water service after sitting at our table for five minutes. After finally getting some water and a little re-hydration after walking around Singapore midday we went to the buffet. After we got back, noticed another table being sat, this table was immediately offered a wine list as well as water. Overall, not a huge problem and sometimes a restaurant's staff can simply overlook things. The next thing I noticed though was that the other table was also brought a plate of the Tiffin Room's famous Nan. I do not believe that table requested it, but once again I had to flag down a waiter to order a serving which would arrive fifteen minutes later. When the Nan arrived, I went for another plate at the buffet. And when I got back, there were several things that upset me. First my napkin was still on my chair where I had left it after standing up-at a venue as refined and as high priced as the Tiffin Room, I expect my napkin to be folded and ready when I get back. Second, my old plate was still on the table which, with how small the table was, left me holding up my new plate for five minutes before I got the attention of another waiter to take away the dirty plate. Finally, though my plate was still present, my silverware had mysteriously disappeared and would also not return without my prompting. These problems were a recurring theme throughout my meal. Now I understand and am willing to accept incompetent or bad service, but I refuse to take discriminatory service. As we finally managed to get everything back in place, the other table stood up for their second serving and I watched miraculously as napkins were taken up and folded, dirty plates were taken away, and new silverware was placed as quickly as could be. Needless to say, this infuriated me, and simply made me more mad each time I came back to a dirty plate while the other table was being served immaculately by the same exact staff as was serving our table. The final straw came when I ordered a second serving of Nan. After another twenty minute wait, a waiter finally emerged from the kitchen carrying two plates of Nan, the waiter then quickly placed one of those plates on the other table. I then distinctly heard the table say that they had not ordered the Nan. The waiter told them, to not worry about it and just enjoy it. I figured, then that the plate of Nan I had actually ordered must be coming out next then, but no it never did come. I'm sure the waiter simply never bothered to even reorder or Nan even when he knew full well that he had mis-served the first order. By the time I once again was able to ask a waiter where my order was, I was informed that it was too late and the kitchen was closed, they would only be able to make me half an order. I obviousy left the restaurant livid. I understand that some of my complaints may seem a little picky, but honestly when one is paying over 60 USD for a Indian Lunch buffet, one expects impeccable service. This was a restaurant that was clearly able to offer such impeccable service, however, we were on the outside looking in even and it honestly felt intentional. Oh well, at the very least, I now have a small inkling of what it felt like to be a non-Caucasian during colonial times. Thanks Raffles and Tiffin Room for the educatio

excellent food ......
and service. don't forget you are at the raffle's hotel. after a lunch go to the bakery and have one of there excellent cafe's and pastries. and don't forget to take a pasalubong at the shop.

this famous and in koloniaal style build hotel is after years of renovation, a „must” to take at least a high tea. The Raffles Hotel is in the center and only 20 min. for airport. We enjoyed our delicious high tea in old style. SUPER!
5
Had Afternoon Tea. Felt like I was in a 1930's film. Atmosphere. Good food. Wonderful service, really wonderful. As you would imagine it. And then some...
4
The breakfast was very good. No huge buffet, but all you need for a great start. We also had dinner there and enjoyed Indian buffet. Also recommendable, good food, good quality, friendly staff
5
Had a great breakfast here, in the lovely surrounding of Raffles. Eggs Benedict was top class, and the Bento Box likewise. Not cheap at s$100 for two, but worth it.
4
I have experienced the Tiffin Room Indian buffet a few times now and the selection is always pleasing and very tasty! The atmosphere is probably a little empty as is the restaurant on my visits.Value-wise I suppose it's the setting that commands a steeper price but it's a nice experience.Worth a look
5
This was a wonderful experience. By New Zealand standards it was expensive but it was worth every cent. The staff were attentive; the food was delicious and there was an abundance of it. The tea and coffee was regularly replenished. All in all it was a splendid afternoon

There is no doubt having the curry buffet lunch at the Tiffin Room has the ambience and nostalgia of a byegone era. However, the food is really nothing extraordinary, the buffet has limited selection and is certainly over priced. If the Tiffin Room wants to continue to trade on its brand name and reputation, it will soon find that the only people going there will be tourists as it will become apparent to local foodies that you can get exactly the same quality and range of curry buffet lunch for half the price or less elsewhere. If this restaurant wants to retain a 'wow factor', it seriously needs to look at putting the 'wow factor' back into the buffet presentation and the restaurant experience
4
I wish there had just been tea and not all the added foods including dim sum and dragon fruit. The tea presented at our table with the normal 3-tiered tray and perhaps the addition of some scones with clotted cream would have been perfect, but when we arrived, they were about to end the tea service and urged us to do the buffet first so we wouldn't miss it. I'd have preferred to miss the buffet as the tea food was better and I ended up with soy sauce mixing with the pastries on my plate as there were no separate little bowls for sauces. The people watching from our table overlooking the fountain in the courtyard was fabulous. The tea was good, the buffet not so good. The price which came in right around $60 was reasonable
5
We pre-booked the high tea with the hotel before leaving home. Glad we did as large queue, very busy. We were shown to table with a sandwich platter, including cakes. Tea or coffee provided, or drinks if you prefer. There is a self service buffet with various savoury and sweet snacks. You are encouraged to go up as many times as you like. When you have eaten your platter it gets replaced with another until you tell them to stop, the same goes for the coffee and tea. The service was excellent and we left there feeling we had been spoilt and well fed.we then went upstairs to the long bar to sample the Singapore sling again another great experience.would highly recommend a visit here it is great value and a must in Singapor
5
Tried the Tiffin Room for their buffet curry quite late one evening. There was a large variety of different dishes which were all very fresh. What really made the evening was the fantastic service.
5
Superb restaurant within Raffles! No need to say anymore, fabulous service, beautiful ambience, superb food! Wow!
5
Visited Raffles and had High Tea in the beautiful Tiffin Room.Hours were 3 pm -5.30 pm.If you get the chance having High Tea is really worth the cost .....around $54 Singapore $'s per person.The Tiffin Room is beautiful and you can feast on beautiful cakes /hot dumplings/fruit/iced teas etc and of course bottomless cups of tea/coffee.Harpist adds to the ambience and elegance of the occasion.Smart casual for women and men requested to wear long pants /collared shirt(polo ok) and closed shoes.We booked several months in advance and would advise to as it is very popular with tourists.Don't forget to have a Singapore Sling while you are there 
3
The service and lay-out of the high tea were excellent. My partner and I chose to come here to experience a little bit of luxury, but were left disappointed by the food. A small selection of sandwiches and very poor scones and other pastries left a dry taste in the mouth, especially when the bill arrived.
5
I booked a table, to celebrate my husband's birthday, at short notice by sending in an email. The reply was courteous and helpful, saying they were honoured that we had chosen their restaurant for my husband's birthday celebration and hoping we had an 'enchanting evening'.From the moment we arrived at the front of the hotel we were treated with the utmost courtesy, enjoyed cocktails in the bar before dinner, and were seated at a lovely table-for-two overlooking the courtyard. The food was delicious and there was so much choice that one visit to the buffet table couldn't possibly be enough. Just when we thought we'd had enough, we realised there was still dessert so we sampled a selection, which were also delicious, and were very full. However, the waiting staff, who had achieved the rarity of being both discreet and attentive at the same time, then arrived with a beautifully decorated chocolate birthday cake, complete with candle and name plaque. The waiters all gathered round to sing 'Happy birthday' and my husband was completely overwhelmed by how special they had made him feel.I would thoroughly recommend a visit to this restaurant, particularly if you have something special to celebrate

Tiffin room at Raffles hotel is a fine dining restaurant serving north-Indian cuisine in buffet style for dinner. Ambience is similar to any fine dining place. Service was top notch and thatâ€™s expected isn't it? The buffet spread was separated in to four sections. Cold starters, warm starters, the mains and the desserts. What I really liked about the buffet spread was the variety of vegetarian dishes. Usually, the vegetarian dishes are very limited in buffet spread but here it was different. The palak panner was really awesome! They serve naan of your choice in basket straight to your table to ensure its fresh and crispy! The highlight of the buffet spread is the dessert section. There were around fifteen dishes to indulge! Gulab jaamuns, kheers, halwas, payasam, fruits, milk sweets and pistachio ice-cream (instead of usual kulfi). It costs around $90 per pax but its worth the money you pay
5
This is one of those places much like the Singapore sling that you just have to experience.The setting is very 'colonial' but I guess that is part of the experience.Inside the place is light and airy and the staff are polite and really helpful. You are greeted on your table with a three tiered of awesomeness....... or sandwiches, cakes and more cakes.There is also a buffet with fresh fruit, scones, pies, dim sum and the best bread and butter pudding outside of England.A great experience, just make sure you book in advance

High tea @ the Tiffin Room at The Raffles Hotel in Singapore is an experience one should not miss while visiting this amazing city. I went with my eldest daughter, who lives in the city, and my wife. As anticipated, it turned out to be a special 2 hours. Room decor outstanding and British colony. Fingers sandwiches at the table weredelicious and in abundance...egg salad, tuna salad, ham & cheese and fish...tasted yummy with tea (which was like I never tasted before). Oh, the best small desserts too you ever tasted; sweet, creamy and fresh. Then...there is the buffet filled with more hors d'overs and specialty foods, sandwiches , fruits, flavored teas and more desserts. Quality of food superior. Waitstaff outstanding and polite. Ambience special and impeccable. Don't miss a visit to this establishment when visiting the lovely and special city of Singapore.Yes, expensive, but worth the experience
5
Followed everyone's good reviews and went for High Tea in the Tiffin Room at Raffles and it exceeded expectations. Had three different generations traveling together and there was something for everyone. Had the non alcohol option and thought it was a great bargain for the money. Have had Tea in places like Victoria B.C., Australia, Dubai and London itself and this surpassed those experiences and was less expensive. The atmosphere was incredible, the service five star and the food was great with extensive choices beyond the cakes, pastries and tasty scones. Try the fruit infused Iced Tea it was great !
5
I was a bit concerned about going to the high tea after reading the reviews however should not have worried: it was awesome. The service, the harpist, the food and the decor were all wonderful. We had eaten earlier as thought there would not be a lot of food, big mistake! For a high tea there was plenty. In addition to the table-served tiered platter (not replenished) there was the buffet of additional drinks, sweet and savoury tidbits. Lovely and well worth doing. Also use your ANZ credit card for 20% off!!
5
definitely a must for visitors to Raffles - a great way to spend an afternoon with friends. Try the variety of sandwiches, cakes and teas and get out of the mid day heat.
5
Something for everyone. Great assortment and everything was excellent, food, service and atmosphere.
5
What a lovely old fashioned way to end our holiday taking afternoon tea. Good selection of food yummy cakes and pudding. The staff were excellent and made our experience so memorable
5
High Tea is a must here in the Tiffin Room, and if you extend your visit they serve excellent curries in the evening. Superb service and cuisine
4
The Tiffin restaurant on the ground floor is a delight. Quiet and elegant, with lovely table detailing and pleasant staff. For 75SD per person, you are presented with an array of wonderful buffet style curries and Indian delicacies. We felt welcomed by the staff and were free to go up to the buffet several times to try all the food. Three special signature dishes were also brought to the table. Vegetarian options were available too. The wine list is fairly basic and we ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio. When presented to the table, the bottle was warm and sent back. It was eventually replaced by a slightly colder Chardonnay.The Tiffin is a lovely restaurant to share with friends or a loved one.TIP. Valet parking outside the main Beach Road entrance is only 10SD for 3 hours

I'm American, so perhaps my view of high tea isn't that of British people. Having said that, I thought it was lovely. Before going to Raffles, I read reviews on Tripadvisor and was skeptical about going. Many people complained about stale sandwiches or tasteless Chinese buffet food. That wasn't my experience at all. The food was so good. The scones were delicious, the Siu Mai (I hope I spelled that correctly) were also very good.There's lots of fresh fruit and lovely sandwiches too.The atmosphere was fantastic; not stuffy but not too casual. The staff was warm, friendly and professional. And the restaurant itself is so grande. I think it is a must when in Singapore
5
Suggested by a friend as a MUST DO in Singapore, we decided to take his word and make a reservation at the Tiffin Room at the Raffles. We were there on a Monday after lunar new year and there weren't many people. The food selection was varied, something for everyone. We were also served Chef's Specials at our table which weren't part of the buffet, also very good. They had the exotic star fruit as a palate cleanser, it was inspired. Our wait person was very friendly and helpful, had a good time. Although pricey, I would recommend
4
Amazing High Tea - my brother booked us in for High Tea and we were not disappointed. I had my heart set on a Singapore sling but thankfully was talked out of it... Beautiful traditional hotel and loved the decadence of afternoon tea - tea and scones to die for
5
Though it has been a while since the Diwali festival, I could not miss writing a review about the Tiffin Room. It was an immensely nostalgic experience for me. Coupled with the delectable food and considerate service, the chef was very gracious. The wide assortment of menu along with the pleasing presentation was a real treat, and I felt as if I was in back in India! The mutton korma was scrumptious and it went well with the "ambi panna". I commend the chef for being so thorough and guiding me through the buffet, kudos to the chef and the staff at the Tififn Room for a great evening! It sure made my day. I would surely recommend Tiffin Room to all the friends and look forward to visiting soon
5
Reserved online to have afternoon tea at the Raffles Hotel on a Saturday afternoon. The place was packed but the food was yummy. It cost SGD78 per person...expensive but truly enjoyed lots of food varieties including Chinese dim sum and other Christmas specialties like minced pies and Christmas cookies. Loved the sandwiches on the tiered tray. Both the hot and cold teas were great! The live music played on the harp was perfect for the spot
5
lovely ambience, great food choice at breakfast and great service. prices not too bad considering. afternoon tea looked nice but we didnt try it
4
five star food and very organized and attentive staff.the high tea is something that you should definitely experience
5
The Tiffin Room is the dining room for Raffles residents and offers a spectacular breakfast buffet and a la carte menu and an Indian lunch and dinner menu.
The breakfast is amazing and the staff are attentive and obliging.
4
Visited for Breakfast and was pleased with the super service and assortment from the menu, which is made to order and not buffetted out. The Roti Paratha experience has to improve. The parathas have to move beyond the Malaysian taste to the true authentic Indian taste
5
I booked a table at the Tiffin Room for dinner for my friends birthday via email prior to arriving in Singapore. All the details were promptly confirmed together with details of the dress code and prices. The staff arranged to make a birthday cake for that evening which was a really nice touch and even personalised it with a message from me. Entrance to the restaurant is via the main hotel entrance. The Tiffin Room itself is beautiful clean and there is a great relaxed atmosphere. Right from the outset until you leave the staff are professional, attentive and friendly. I had to mention this as service on this level is hard to come by. The buffet is amazing. There is a large selection of starters (both hot and cold) and mains with a generous selection of vegetarian food. The food is at the right temperature, is fresh and tasty. There is also a huge selection of desserts. The restaurant caters for different tastes and while it is a buffet, it appears the chef has selected each dish individually which complements other dishes. The breads are made fresh on order and these are ready for when you eat your mains. There are also three special dishes of the day which are brought to the table.Our visit to the Raffles Tiffin Room was a great treat... we will definitely return for this unique experience
4
A magnificent afternoon tea is served here--expensive but worth it. In the evening an Indian buffet is served with an abundant variety of food. The white room retains a 'colonial' atmosphere with ceiling fans, etc., though you might want to take a coat as the air conditioning can be a bit on the cold side
4
What away to round up a holiday at Singapore. Quiet and relaxing with soft music in the background, this is the perfect way to wind down before returning home. An experience enjoyed by all including my 9 year old. Good food and good service in a relaxing environment is what we expected and we were not disappointed. We would repeat this experience. Do not forget to make reservations
5
.....To which I should add, and cheaper! But I should say that the Tiffin Room offers a larger selection of food if that is what you want (most peoples' priority might however be the experience). While the setting (it is the Tiffin Room at Raffles after all) is superb I am bound to say that I did not prefer this over the high tea experience at the Peninsula which to my way of thinking was more traditional, genuine and perhaps even genteel. The high tea at Raffles is really a buffet which allows you to indulge yourself in a range of foods in addition to the traditional high nibbles. I am of the sort that prefers the traditional petit fours, scones and sandwiches and not much else. Also they did not provide a selection of teas. I would have preferred Earl Grey but had to have whatever was served up (which was of suitable quality, however). The total cost for 2 - close to $200 including taxes and service fees. I certainly do not regret it but may not be in quite such a hurry to repeat it although neither would I say that I would never do it again if I had the chance. On the upside the service was predictably excellent, they also served (at extra cost) a pleasant glass of Billecart-Salmon Champagne. And as I said the setting was impeccable. Oh one other thing - when I visited a couple of days before to make a booking I was refused entry to the establishment as I was "improperly dressed". Despite the fact that I was wearing linen shorts, boating shoes and a fashionable if discrete shirt I was still not up to par and had to stand like a naughty boy outside whilst the booking was made for me. I was sternly warned to turn up on the day in proper attire. I suggest you do the same :^

We planned to try Tiffin room and Indian buffet as we love Raffles in general and we felt it is a must. We made a reservation couple of days before our arrival to Singapore. They confirmed it very promptly with all details of the buffet, including information about the dress code. When we came, we were welcomed very nicely, the staff called us our names all the time. We were amazed by the beautiful place, it has such a unique atmosphere. The staff was extremely professional and helpful, they showed us all meals they offered that evening. There was a selection of starters, then selection of main courses and huuuge selection of desserts. Starters and main courses have always vegetarian options. The cuttlery and all the serving bowles were silver, very unusual and very posh, great for really special occasions. We managed to try everything and we had a wonderful evening there. The reason I am giving 4 points is that the food was very good but it was not the best I've ever had. In general, it was beautiful experience

Enjoyed the special Festive High Tea on Christmas Day as a celebration of Christmas and my husband's birthday. The only downside was the booking process done from Australia. The hotel wanted a photocopy of our credit card back and front emailed to them. We didn't want to expose this information to cyberspace so in the end we had to use wire transfer - no problem. Confirmation email was promptly sent and it included the dress code for men and women. It was wonderful to see that this code was enforced on the day as a couple of people were turned away. If you're going to dine in a great hotel show respect and dress the part. It doesn't cost alot to look decent. Members of our group were worried that they would feel hungry after a High Tea here - were they wrong! The tiered cake stand was replenished with sandwiches as was the hot buffet. The food was top notch. Dining at such an institution is expensive but you're not only paying for the food but also for the experience. The hotel was buzzing, the staff had smiles on their faces and everyone was having a great time. Our waiter - Kumar - was impeccable, professional and full of good humour. He made us feel that we were the only table in the room. He made our day. As it was also my husband's birthday, the staff brought out a delicious cake and candle and the musician played Happy Birthday and everyone sang. A lovely thought. Dining at the Raffles is taking part in Singapore's history. It is an experience that everyone should try at least once during their travels
1
See my long-winded review about the negative experience we had at Raffles with dry sandwiches, over salty cold dim-sums and terrible cake! Ruined my 50th!
The curry buffet did look great though - would have been better choice!
5
At $60 each plus tax and service it's no cheap meal. However going at lunch time the Indian buffet is delicious and a full 3 course meal with tea/coffee in an interesting venue isn't too bad. Really enjoyable experience and a nice treat!
5
You have got to try out this place which serves the best Indian food, be enthralled by the exquisite details which goes into cooking the usual Indian delights.
5
My wife and I stopped off in Singapore recently for the purpose of having dinner at Raffles.The last time we did this was about 20 years ago, so we had a bit of an idea what to expect, although a lot can change in 20 years.We decided we would try the Indian Buffet this visit, and although I wasn't a great lover of Indian food prior to our visit, I have to say I'm a convert now.From the moment we arrived at Raffles, the service was impeccable. No detail was overlooked, you are treated as special guests, even though we were not staying at Raffles.The food and the service was truly wonderful.Anyone looking for that special place to go for dinner cannot go past Raffles
4
This is a great place as a single diner being a buffet. Excellent quality food and lots of variety. Staff are very good. Great way to try out lots of different Indian foods that are difficult to do A la carte. Its currently $75 which is steep with service and GST extra but still a good meal.

We had a two day stopover in Singapore. Afternoon tea at the Iconic Raffles Hotel was first on our list of things to do. We were not dissapointed. Elegant surroundings enhanced by a harp being played throughout our afternoon tea.Freshly made dainty sandwiches and scrumptious cakes and pastries. Once we had eaten all the goodies on our cake stand, we were able to help ourselves to a buffet of the same including warm scones with clotted cream and jam. We really enjoyed the Raffles experience and felt it worth the cost. Definitely advise to book in advance

I planned to visit Raffles Hotel for its afternoon tea on my last day in Singapore thinking this would be the perfect way to end the trip as my mom had been telling me how superb the food and service was when she went there 10 years ago. The decor, furniture, service etc were very nice but the food was a massive let down. The cakes and tarts were no better than what you could get from the supermarket, the scones were hard and stale and I could hardly cut open it. The waiter even poured English breakfast into my cup of half finished Earl Grey. Overall, great disappointment and I would never ever recommend the afternoon tea to anyone

A lot of hotels have wonderful breakfast buffets with seeming limitless choices. Breakfast in the Tiffin Room at Raffles has all the choices, but it just feels like there is something extra. Perhaps it's the ambiance, or the service. There doesn't seem to be the hustle and bustle of many large buffets. Rather, pick up a newspaper and enjoy the peace and quiet along with an excellent breakfast.

We ate at Tiffin for lunch and there were quite a number of starters available as well as poppadum and pickles. Our favourites were the mini vegetable samosas.The curry selection was chicken, lamb and fish. My favoured option would have been chicken as I don't eat lamb but I was unable to have it as it had been prepared with yogurt and I am dairy intolerant.The chef came out of the kitchen to tell us what we could eat which was good, but there was no offer of adapting the dishes or providing any alternatives.The fish curry was very good and my partner said the chicken was lovely. There were a good range of desserts available although I could only eat the fruit.The serving staff are a little 'over the top' but very courteous and we had to ask for our drinks a number of times before they were served, but on the whole the food was really good quality and very tast

I ate here several times while staying at Raffles. Like all of Raffles' staff, the waiters were extremely friendly and attentive. The buffet breakfast was very good and included an a la carte egg option, including Eggs Benedict and omelettes. The afternoon tea was likewise very good, containing standard fair of sandwiches and cakes, as well as a buffet of cakes, meats and dim sum dumplings. I tried the Indian dinner buffet and this too was very good. The selection was excellent and included chef choice amuse bouches that were brought to your table.I would definitely eat here on my next stay in Singapore

Loved everything about this. Food great, service fantastic, atmosphere unbeatable. We only did breakfast, but Tiffin lunch, high tea (along with harpist) looked pretty amazing. Give marvellous Marvin our regards when you see him please!

Raffles is a splendid hotel with a nostalgic feeling and definitely worth a visit. Afternoon Tea is certainly very popular, with a booking required. However, the hotel would seem to rest on its reputation rather than offering a first class service. It was necessary to ask for the plates to be cleared, although they were very quick off the mark to offer you a glass of champagne (not included in the standard price). Sandwiches were good, although limited to those initially served on the cake stand. Our table was booked for 4.30 pm (restaurant closed at 5.30 pm) and some of the cakes / fruit etc. that you helped yourself to were not replenished towards the end and therefore for those who ate at a more leisurely pace missed out ! Expensive Afternoon Tea for the quality / customer service compared with other good hotels in Singapore (Fullerton Hotel would be my preferred choice)

My wife and I had afternoon high tea at Raffles, we booked it some time ago through Trailfinders. Firstly the outside façade is amazing what you see in magazines and on television is the same but you have got to see it up close. The male members of staff at the entrance are in traditional Indian dress and are immaculately turned out.The high tea was truly great, you get small sandwiches and cakes on a traditional stand with nice cutlery and crockery also. There was a female playing a harp close to where we were sitting and the music was nice.The interior is immaculate, all white and the main staircase and the furniture add a nice colour to it all.If you want a Singapore Sling go to the long bar, but it will cost you about 32 Singapore dollars (about £20), there is monkey nut shells all over the floor, this is only part of the hotel which is untidy and not to quiet.Overall it was a pleasure to have had afternoon tea at Raffles, it is something you will never forget.I would highly recommend this to any person who is travelling to Singapor

We felt a visit to Raffles was a must while we were in Singapore and decided to book for high tea after sampling a Singapore sling in the long bar 1st! The setting and atmosphere of the Tiffin room was charming and very relaxing with a harpist playing throughout the afternoon. Staff were friendly and attentive. You're given a 3 tiered stand with a selection of sandwiches and cakes on your table when you arrive and offered tea and coffee. Champagne and other alcoholic drinks are available. You also have access to a buffet table with a selection of dim sum, fresh fruits, truffles, scones and desserts. Yes, it is a little pricey but a lovely afternoon treat!

Wandered in to Raffles Hotel as a bit of a tourist on my own and just thought I'd have something for lunch while I was there. Spotted the Tiffin Room where they were serving a curry buffet. Service was impeccable, although obviously it was help yourself to food, the drinks, and other bits came quickly. Buffet had everything you might expect - poppadoms, naan, rice, several curries with all the appropriate additional bits - chutneys etc. My only quibble was the price which at S$63.00++ was quite steep. It was the RAffles Hotel I suppose

We booked in for High Tea at Raffles with a couple of friends. Please take my advice and book ahead or you most likely wont get in. We booked a week in advance and could only get an early spot on the Friday, everything else was full and when we arrived many were being turned away.Tiffin Room at Raffles HotelTiffin Room at Raffles HotelThe Tiffin Room is lavishly decorated with many well trained staff. Bear in mind there is a dress code to get in and they will turn you away… Everything is in immaculate white and there are live pianists/harpists playing in the background. Our waiter was superb and happy to take pictures for us. They aslo had a special on some very expensive champagne which made it very inexpensive so we had a bottle as well.Tiffin Room High Tea StackTiffin Room High Tea StackThe usual cake stack was placed on the table. The cakes were good but the sandwiches were a bit poor. Barely a scraping of filling was put in them and they were a bit bland…Tiffin Room High Tea Dim SumTiffin Room High Tea Dim SumHowever the buffet section more than made up with this with some very good all you can eat Dim Sum of various flavours and some excellent dipping sauces. These were replenished quickly so were always fresh and if your favourite was empty it would literally be a moment before it was full again.Tiffin Room High Tea SconesTiffin Room High Tea SconesThe scones were also in a buffet format with either a choice of fruit or plain and then help yourself strawberry jam and clotted cream. There didnt appear to be alternative jams on offer. The scones were good and since you could load them up with as much jam and cream as you wanted there was no reason to not over indulge.The High Tea ended up costing roughly £70 per head including the champagne. It was a nice afternoon out to be fair but I didn’t think the food was really up to a high standard

Decided to treat the kids and booked in via email for high tea at Raffles. Kids enjoyed putting on their "finery" to go. Previous writes on TA advise to be there slightly early which we did. There was a small queue waiting on our arrival but as it was out of the main tourist season, not bad. Shown to our table by a very friendly and efficient waiter. The afternoon tea was everything we expected. Kids loved the cakes, desserts and sandwiches as well as the dumplings. There was no shortage of food and the staff were excellent and attentive. High tea at Raffles is a definite treat for people for that "special occasion" and we highly recommend it as a one off, must do in Singapore. The ambience and old world charm of Raffles in itself adds to the overall experience. Congratulations to the staff who made a big fuss of the kids and treated them as very special guests

Don't book a tour for afternoon tea. We were really looking forward to visiting Raffles on our visit to Singapore, however we felt like second class citizens when told that we must use a side entrance. We then had to queue to wait for the restaurant doors to open. When we were finally allowed in for afternoon tea we were shown into a small side room. The ambience and quality of food was nothing like the standard one would get from The Ritz or The Savoy in London. The final disappointment was when tasting the famous Raffles Singapore Sling which was the worst version we had tasted. It may be a better experience to visit independently but personally I don't know why the hotel has such an outstanding reputation

Special birthday lunch - lovely venue, amazing buffet food, the main course curries were delicious, and the service was exemplary, as you would expect from Raffles. A lovely touch at the end was when they bought out a birthday cake having overheard that it was someone's birthday (not that any of us had any room left!)
4
We were 15 minutes late for our booking due to heavy traffic from our Hotel ( Marina Bay Sands), the doorman in a black suit at the main entrance of The Raffles Hotel was quite abrupt when I said we have come for afternoon tea, he said it closes at 5 have you booked? I said yes then he just told us to go to the second door on the right. The receptionist at the Tiffin room however was very understanding and charming. She showed us to our table and then we were served. Our tea csme late and the sandwiches were quite dry as if they were under the air conditioning for a long time but the atmosphere was relaxing especially with a harpist playing which is a pleasant change to the usual pisnist for afternnon teas in other hotels. There is also a buffet where we served ourselves with more cakes etc.. Plus dimsums and dumplings.It was disappionting to see some people were allowed to come in wearing trainers and quite scruffy clothes, but all in all if you want a different experience at a Colonial type hotel in the middle of thr modern Singapore this is worth a try. If you take your Singapore Airiine boarding card you receive 20% discount
5
Superb setting,attentive and friendly staff and the Chef on hand to explain the dishes and cook little side dishes for you to savour.All in all,a lovely experience.
5
We just had to go to the Raffles Hotel for afternoon tea. It was an excuse to dress up and go posh. It was an experience everybody going to Singapore should enjoy
4
Ate the curry buffet here in the evening. Very good selection of tastes and strengths of curry, some mild some very hot.
Great service
5
A very nice experience excellent service, the staff very attentive and welcoming. There was a variety that would fit most tastes and we felt that it warranted the cost. We shall remember the meal as a part of a fantastic overall experience.

Curry lunch at tiffin room, very average currys.good choice but have had much better.this is nothing like the currys ive had india...not good value
5
The afternoon tea in the tiffin room is to die for. Plenty of top ups of sandwiches & a buffet of other delights to help yourself too. Yes it's a bit pricey but its worth it. Would recommend to anyone.
5
One could easily say it's a lot of money for a cup of tea and a few sandwiches, but afternoon tea at the Tiffin Room is so much more than that. It's a whole experience of nostalgia for a bygone age, which just happens to include a cup of tea and a few sandwiches - and some very nice cakes and scones too!A "must do" on a trip to Singapore
5
Our visit for afternoon tea was one of the highlights of our recent trip to Singapore!We booked for 4pm which meant we had no queue when we arrived. Service was excellent, quality and choice of most of the food excellent. There is plenty of food so much that you can miss eating again that night!I had to persuade my husband to book Raffles as he saw it as being expensive for a few sandwiches and a cup of tea but we all really enjoyed it. The whole experience, from the anticipation, to the arrival and wander around the hotel. The Singapore sling, the harpist, the dim sum. We paid at the end with a recognised credit card and received quite a substantial discount as they had a promotion with at the time of our visit. That put an even bigger smile on hubby's face

After enjoying a lovely high tea in the Tiffen Room 3 years ago, we returned to The Raffles again for this signature afternoon tea.Sadly, standards have clearly slipped and what The Raffles terms a "high tea" is merely a basic afternoon tea at a very high price!To sum up...Our tier of food was already on the table when we were marched into the Tiffen Room for our 3:30pm sitting... Begs the question how long had it been sitting there as the bread on our sandwiches was somewhat dry.Asking for a tea menu we were told there was no such thing and the waiter rambled off a basic selection of tea... Earl grey, morning breakfast, Darjeeling. We were further disappointed when our tea was bought to the table... as tea bags, not loose leaf tea as should be the case for a high tea.Ordering champagne, our waiter used white wine glasses to serve us instead of champagne flutes... this from an iconic and supposedly classy Singapore establishment.The food was ok, but basic, with a buffet also available.Not worth the money and we will not be going back on our next visit to Singapore
1
Supposed to be afternoon tea which is terribly (in a good way) british, however if you like dim sum and pau's then you should have no problems. It was my friends birthday and we asked for some typical british afternoon tea delights however they rudely suggest they could check if they have popadoms and samosa as my friends are all of Indian race! How very cheeky to suggest that assuming thats is all Indians eat. Would I go back? ABSOLUTELY NOT! If you want good afternoon tea go to the St Regi
5
Had afternoon tea and curry buffet, both were delightful and as much food available asyou could eat , Tiffin room staff very pleasant and attentive .
5
Go for the menu and choose all the eggs there.
The chef cooks only when it's ordered. So everything is so so fresh. dishes come out fast too. loved it!
5
Excellent range and quality of North Indian food. The service was excellent, and the room wonderfully colonial.
5
Probably the most expensive curry buffet you might eat in the world, but the service, the surroundings and the quality of the food make this a worthwhile treat!
4
Thoroughly enjoyed High Tea in the Tiffin Room as a special treat for our daughter celebrating a birthday. The food was delicious, especially the scones, very light, the sandwiches were varied and the little cakes superb, the requested Herbal Tea was not a problem and the Harp played in the background added a nice relaxing touch. My only criticism is the long wait in a que before being seated even though we had a booking, this seems a little tacky for such a high class venue, apart from this minor detail the afternoon was a delightful experience
5
I and 13 guests had the supreme pleasure of lunching on the Curry Tiffin in the Tiffin room in honour of a very 'special' birthday. The majority of us had come from Australia for a weekend of celebrations culminating in this lunch and everything about it fitted the event perfectly. The staff were wonderfully, extraordinarily attentive and extraordinarily thoughtful throughout the meal, culminating in them presenting me with a wonderful token birthday cake while they sang the Birthday Song.The food was very much a colonial rendition of various Indian curries, but were flavoursome, plentiful and utterly delicious. There was a wonderful selection of 'tasters', great pappadums, nan and chutney accompaniments - not to mention an utterly delicious selection of desserts. There were not many others eating at this session so we were fortunate to have the gracious surrounds almost to ourselves - great as we were a little boisterous, but also allowed for less self-consciousness regarding our innumerable returns to the wonderful buffet of delicacies. There was nothing we could fault about this experience. I had booked the event a good 8 weeks prior to the day and all dealings with the food and beverage staff were professional and pleasant. Yes, it's expensive; yes alcohol is prohibitively so (where is it not in Singapore) but I had spent weeks preparing for this eventuality. The staff were most helpful in the wine selection (a surprisingly good Indian Sav Blanc) and presented the bill in such a fashion that allowed for a discount.This was a memorable climax to our weekend's celebration - the grace of Raffles itself, the charm of the staff and the quality of the food and service will never been forgotten

We stayed at the Raffles Hotel and had the pleasure of dining here for breakfast every morning of our 5 day stay. The staff were wonderful and took the time to great us by name each day. The old world charm of the hotel, extends into this gorgeous dining room. The food was superb with a varied selection of hot food to order a la carte, and a good range of bread, pastries,cereals, fruits, cold meats and cheese. Probably not one of the best breakfasts in a hotel I have experienced, but certainly very adequate. My husband loved the omelette and ordered it every day.We also had high tea here one day, which we found value for money and very enjoyable. We loved the little chair that we were given to place my handbag or newspaper on
5
Reminds me of Spike Milligan's Quote "I told them I was ill!" "We knew it would be expensive!" Advertised at SD75/ head it is well worth the experience, the food is extensive and varied the dedicated curry monster should have a ball; however this is a currey buffet with a differance very few dishes you would recognise from a British curry house; a large selection of quality hot and cold starters followed by main course of meats and vegetable curries with a choice of rice and Nan bread, seconds and possibly thirds are a must! Sweet is varied and plentiful again seconds are unavoidable. The service is second to none as you would expect, your table is relaid with fresh cutlery and napkins between course. Overall a superb experience. Now for the warning; drinks/water are expensive even by Singapore standards EG SD18 for small bottle of Tiger = Â£18 a pint, 10% service charge added and then the unavoidable Gov Tax (these added SD100 to the bill. A great night well worh the visit, recommend a stiff drink after you pay the bill, assuming you have any money left
5
We had breakfast there every day and it was the best we have ever had. Every thing was done to perfection and the staff couldn't do enough for you. I even got a little chair for my bag to sit on which was so different and nice. The waffles which I had every day were the best and freshly done on request with a lovely fresh fruit. The poached eggs were done to perfection and the bacon really crisp just how we like it
3
The High Tea serving comprises the stand, containing sandwiches and cakes, and a buffet of dumplings, scones and a number of sweets and cakes. There is no tea selection - only the one. Service was not attentive, however staff were pleasant. Tea was not in fact served in your own pot, but from a large communal one - all tea pots were being used (noting the restaurant was little over half full). Staff did not refill tea cups unless prompted. Of note however, the chef, upon being advised I had a dietary requirement, personally came and introduced himself to advise on the options available - a nice touch. With champagne to start, it is $95 SGD pp. It's not on a par with London hotels, which in my experience on service and presentation (both of the serving, and the table setting) leads. In all, a somewhat disappointing repeat visit. P.S. I feel I'm being a little generous with a 3-star rating
5
You must do a high tea at this place it is in the Raffles Hotel need i say anymore the place is iconic just for being the Raffles Hotel
4
I am prepared to admit I really like visiting Raffles. This timeless dined in the Tiffin room. That night was Indian curry night. I was a very good authentic meal. It was a smorgasbord of delights. The staff were extremely pleasant and attentive. raffles should be proud of its quality and service
2
Booked high tea with a friend a month in advance (we fly to Singapore frequently). We were really looking forward to it as it it had been on the list for ages. Turned up on time only to be told they couldn't find our booking. They asked us to wait in the lobby. We waited for about 20mins with no one approaching us. It wasn't until I got up to complain that we were taken to a table and only because I pointed out that it was free. We were offered no apologies or refreshment while we waited. The food was average (although the tea was lovely). We asked if we could take a leftover cake with us that we had on our plate and were told in that standard Singaporean attitude (where anything other then the norm is far too hard to yes to) no we weren't allowed.It was expensive and a very average experience. I wouldn't recommend
5
Really enjoyed our experiences at this Restaurant. We go here regularly with overseas visitors. We consider it good value for a buffet priced meal. Go early so you are not rushed as they have to start preparing for High Tea from 2.30pm onwards. Good variety of curries and yummy Indian Desserts. Highly recommended!

No trip to Singapore could be complete without a trip to Raffles - a real slice of colonial England right in the heart of Asia. We went to the Tiffin Room for tea and it really was an experience we'll always remember.It's a throwback to a more genteel era - and one which we'd probably do well to go back to. Live music gently played in the background while we tucked into a stand full of cakes, pastries and sandwiches. And just incase you forget where you actually are, there a buffet with dim sum and all manner of other goodies to enjoy. From the second you cross the threshold you find yourself in a land that time has forgotten. We of course decided to have a Singapore sling with our tea, given that this is the birthplace of the iconic drink.It was a very civilised way to spend an afternoon - and put another tick on our bucket lisgt
4
We had high tea with family while visiting Singapore and always love having high tea. This was class all the way, the was very good and tea enjoyable. The special champers is nice but not cheap, then again this is not your every day high tea so go for it. The entry is a little weird but all in all, a nice step back in time
4
High Tea at the Raffles is a unique experience, probably just a once-only but still a lovely room with pleasant staff and some nice but not wonderful food. You need to book months ahead and then queue in the heat outside with all the other punters, not so salubrious. Visitors were kept separated from hotel guests which was belittling but the number of C grade tourists walking past is phenomenal. Overall a good thing to do but over-hyped in reality
3
the atmosphere and ambiance is really great, set in the 100+ years old colonial building.The afternoon tea itself was fairly average. Sandwiches made with white sliced bread, the cakes were nice but neither pretty or interesting. The tea was served in tiny pots and if you don't like the strength served then you have to ask for a tea bag. The service was also a let down, the waiting staff quite often hard to find, although the waiting staff were very nice in themselves
5
I had read many reviews about the Tiffin Room, but never paid any heed to them since wasn't too keen on Indian cuisine. Made reservations for a special evening with the wife. We made dinner reservations about 3 days prior to the appointed evening and was pleased to receive timely and courteous responses from the staff confirming my reservation. They even provided details on the buffet menu and dress code so as to ensure I wasn't in for any surprises.On arrival at the venue what grabs your attention is the opulence and grandeur of the hotel housing this restaurant, Raffles Hotel. We were greeted with a very polite and ever-smiling hostess and then escorted to a table of our choice by another equally polite and jovial attendant.The ambience of the restaurant is undoubtedly first class and very much in line with that of the exquisite hotel it's housed within. The high ceiling sprawling with vintage ceiling fans, the wooden furniture, even the uniforms donned by the staff reflects the colonial charm of British India; an era that has a certain elegance and charm, IMHO.The staff is VERY attentive and overtly courteous, a quality that many hotels and restaurants take for granted. Every time we stood up to head up for the buffet, someone would ensure that our plates were cleared and table was spick and span.The food is exquisitely delectable. I'm not usually fond of dining on Indian cuisine, but the menu at Tiffin Room was delicious enough for me to change my mind. The spread is varied, fresh and absolutely lip-smacking. Not to mention, uber authentic, down to the individual spices for the different regional dishes. The highlight was of course the dessert menu which boasted of both hot and cold desserts and ALL Indian, nothing of that fusion crap. For an authentic experience of Indian cuisine with an absolutely brilliant service served up in an ambience highlighting the elegance of the British India period, Tiffin Room is a definite must on your list
5
We had High Tea here as a treat. It is not cheap but that is the case everywhere you go these days. Raffles has a very special something about it. The high ceilings, the white walls, the echoes of a colonial era long gone transport you to a more genteel era. In the more than 30 years since I first set foot in Raffles I had not experienced a High tea, so it had a lot to live up to. And it did. The food was plentiful, the tea delicious, and the service attentive. And the little touches, particularly the little chair provided to keep my handbag off the floor, made the day just wonderful. A minor gripe was the time spent queuing waiting for the Tiffin Room to open - somewhere to sit while waiting would have been nice for the older patrons
5
Alright so it's full of Japanese tourists..it's clean and crisp and colonial..the food is designed for the British palate..the waiters are smart and starched..but where on earth is there a better tea to be had anywhere
5
Whether its high tea in the afternoon, or a delicious curry dish in the evenings, this is the place to go.
5
What would you expect -it doesn't disappoint. Like going back in time. Lovely attentive staff and excellent food and cakes.
Queue outside is a little common and perhaps dress code is not strictly enforced which is disappointing.
5
In the Raffles Hotel Tiffin Room. A beautiful buffet in a room of fantastic ambience. Fabulous food, great staff. An unforgettable meal. About S$250 - well worth it.
5
We had High Tea here and it was beautiful, the scones are to die for, the sandwiches are delicious and the cakes are yummy. The staff were awesome and were always coming round to make sure we had enough to eat and drink, if you have a spare hour or so in Singapore give this a go
4
Although the choice of cakes was less than last time I visited High Tea in the Tiffin Room at Raffles Hotel is still good value. Add a glass of Champagne to make it even more special. Staff are very attentive and frequent top ups of tea / coffee and food is provided. Setting is beautiful and the Harp music adds to the occasion.
5
The ambience of the Tiffin Room is wonderful. First class service and friendly, helpful staff.Food is second to none. The Indian buffet is full of amazing dishes with beautiful flavours,and not too spicy either. Perfect for all diners.I asked for yellow dal which is not usually on the menu. The chef prepared me a separate bowl without question. Perfect for couples or large groups. I highly recommend this restaurant
4
Great experience in a truly historic building. Food was mixed. The lamb curry was probably the tastiest I have had and so tender as well. Plus I have never eaten fish (snapper) curry and been able to taste the fish! Yet some of the vegetable dishes were mediocre. You go to try all of the dishes and that's exactly what we did.Top tip gentlemen, remember your long trousers!Enjoy
4
We dined here on a Sunday evening. We arrived at about 8.45 pm but didn't think this would be too late to dine in Singapore. Not so. The restaurant closed at 10 pm. The restaurant itself is beautiful and well worth visiting just for the ambience alone. The food was a North Indian buffet. Some of the dishes were not available and were not replenished when finished. The only criticism was the smug waiter who seemed to delight in telling my husband that it was a mango chutney that he had had with his meal not a citrus chutney. The other staff were lovely
2
As it was a very special wedding anniversary we had pre-booked, sadly it didn't live up to expectation. We arrived 20 minutes before our given time, told by an unhelpful "Raj" dressed man as we got out the taxi we were not able to go in the hotel and told to go round the corner - it wasn't what was said but the way it was! When we got round the corner there was a closed sign on door to the Tiffin Room and a waiting board, so we duly joined the que, as Brits do! A few minutes later the 'tours' arrived and it was manic. Eventually the door opened and individuals were allowed in, as we checked in the sitter was informed "this is our special couple". We were shown to a table right by the food station, the worst possible place to be, table was laid with the 3 tier stand which was fine, given a glass of champagne, then the tour hordes surrounded us to get to the buffet station (which no one had told us was part of the high tea package). We had people knocking into us it was like sitting in the middle of the pigeons at Trafalgar Square!!! We eventually got moved to a side table by the window. No choice of tea, no tea pot and was stewed as it was waiter served for everyone in the restaurant. When I went to the loo, had to go outside the restaurant to a public place and had to que for ages due to the hordes of tours. The special cake was presented to us at the time we asked for the bill.... I can honestly say it was the worse afternoon tea I have ever had and I have had lots. I didn't know whether to cry or laugh at the time. In fact if it hadn't been than I knew my husband had gone to a lot of trouble to organise it I would have walked out there and then. It was a complete rip off. Though will remember the event for ever as a disaster darling!.

We had breakfast here on the first morning which was very nice. The staff were very helpful. Very nice room
3
To be honest, i was pretty disappointed with this afternoon tea experience. First of all, we had to queue up to get in although we have made our reservations well in advance. The queue was by no means short. It stretched the entire length of the restaurant. Food was limited, i have not seen a professional afternoon tea place with such limited choice of 3 tier delights. Just 2 types of cakes, 2 types of tarts which didnt taste that nice, some normal sandwiches that didnt wow me. Scones were served separately and the best things was probably the clotted cream and jam. There was a buffet station which served common fruits such as watermelon, melon, papaya, apple, orange etc. some cakes and a normal dim sum section. I can eat these at home....The char siew bun taste suspiciously like royal china next door except it wasnt as soft. Service was not really that prompt, my used plate wasnt cleared by the time i came back from buffet station. But my friend commented that the champagne was really good. I really like the live harp music, it was refreshing to have such beautiful music for an afternoon session and this was the best part.Overall, it was good to come once but i dont think i will return for another session unless they change the menu

As fairly experienced enjoyers of afternoon tea, we were looking forward to our reservations at the Tiffin Room. It turns out, the best part of the process is making the reservation online which was quick, easy, and painless.The tea, however, was forgettable.Never mind the fact we were seated and then ignored for about 8 minutes (at least the harpist was enjoyable) before someone came to find out if we were interested in having tea (?!) with our tea (I won't address how long it took to actually get it . . . ); never mind the birds that flew in and alighted on the food and buffet table, taking small tastes of what looked good while I wondered when the "bomb" might drop; never mind the table was unsteady and required not one, but two sugar packets placed by my husband to prevent the capsizing of what (we hoped) would be our tea . . . the true disappointment was the utter lack of attention (and hence the reason my husband took action instead of waiting for a staff member who never appeared . . .).The Tiffin Room itself is beautiful and it certainly delivers in terms of providing a "colonial" feel; however, the staff are woefully overworked--in large part because EVERY group wants a photo. It was nearly impossible to get service, when it came it was somewhat hurried and always half-hearted, and it appeared as though taking pictures of guests trumped all other services. The only person who stayed on task was the man who came around with the scones--but he didn't also come around with the clotted cream, so after we used ours up with the two scones initially brought to us, we couldn't even benefit from his work!The management would be advised to hire a few "photogs" who could help take photos of tourists and free the servers to do their jobs so those of us looking for substance aren't sacrificed for style. The food was good, the tea was adequate (although there were very few choices--no lavender!), and the presentation of the buffet appealing. At almost ~$200 for the two of us, however, I expected more in terms of service, care, and overall atmosphere.If you only have time for one tea while you're in Singapore, skip Raffles and go to the Singapore Flyer where they have service and hospitality to spare

Average tasting sandwiches and cakes,limited selection ,tea should be served in tea pots,slow service,constantly having to catch the eye of any waiter,Chinese buffet tastes good but it does not really go with the high tea,we were with two small children and were given a table quite far from the buffet table which meant we had to constantly take turns to help ourselves, including serving the kids. Nice looking room which reminds me of the Orangery in London

We had afternoon tea at Raffles Hotel. Good choice of sandwiches and cakes, and plenty of tea and coffee. The Tiffin Room opened at 3.30pm - our tour guide advised us to start queueing at 3.10pm - and we ended up at the front of the queue. Lovely atmosphere. You can also wonder around the hotel grounds

On advice we booked for this experience. A bit of a queue to get in but very pleasant hosts. Table too near the door but I could look at the rest of the diners!! Lovely food and the buffet was a delight. Ask for a table not near the door or the harpist!! She was excellent but better from a distance.Only one niggle was, after some thought, we were not asked the variety of tea we wanted. Would recommend the experience if you can afford it.Tip? The gift shop is good for a look. To buy is expensive but if you have come all that way ---hey--give it a go!!

Part of the package of staying at Raffles included the breakfast buffet. There was so much choice from the cold section - fruit, cereal, pastries, salads, dim sims, cheeses, cold meats. A menu was provided once you sat down to choose which hot breakfast you wanted - western, asian, waffles, pancakes, etc. The coffee could be better but just ask for a double espresso if you like it stronger like I do. If don't like English Breakfast, you need to specify the type of tea you want.Ate dinner there one night - Indian buffet. So many choices of curries and desserts. Overate, of course, but really enjoyed it. Can buy wine by the glass rather than by the bottle. Most of the staff at breakfast was there at night and were friendly and accommodating to your needs and requests.

Even though we arrived shortly before last orders, this buffet station had been kept looking immaculate and had a wide variety of starters, mains and breads on offer. A particular favourite of mine was the murgh malai kebab, which is a dry dish of chicken marinated in yoghurt and grilled. Much of the appeal of this place is the setting of the restaurant, just off the main lobby to the impressive Raffles Hotel. It is very traditional in style and well worth visiting
5
When I first read about the Tiffin Room and the curry buffet it triggered images of "Bridget Jones" at the infamous turkey-curry buffet. This was nothing of the sort. It was fantastic! I booked online prior to our visit. We arrived early from our walk in the area and were seated immediately. There was lots of selection and the presentation was also wonderful. They also had chicken biryani which is one of my favs. You are offered two choices of nann bread from about 5 or 6 different kinds. It was yummy. I also had a blueberry lassi that really hit the spot. The delectable pistachio ice cream is not to be missed! The Tiffin room is stunning in white and black decor and is just off the lobby. The entire experience was a true delight

Afternoon tea in the Tiffin Room was to have been something of a special experience but it was very average. We were not offered a choice of teas but were automatically served with what many would call English breakfast tea. We did not have our own pot and therefore when we wanted 'top ups' we had to catch the eye of the waiter (not easy) who was positioned at his station quite some distance from our table. He then dispensed the tea from a communal pot. At no time did he come to our table to ascertain whether we would like a 'top up.' The fact that his jacket was stained and needed replacing did not add to this special occasion. The sandwiches were all made of white bread - we were not offered a choice. We were were not offered additional sandwiches or cakes but had to go up to the buffet table to help ourselves. However there were no sandwiches on offer but there were some oriental dumplings. Although we were initially served with a three tear rack of sandwiches, cakes and pastries they were quite small and far from filling. As this was meant to have been something of a delight at a world renowned hotel it did not meet expectations and was nowhere near the standared of similar experiences at other establishments. I formed the impression that this was being run as a tourist attraction rather than and elite tea room. On the plus side what we did have to eat and drink was pleasant as were the staff and the surroundings

Try the Raffles omelette! Delicious. Breakfast buffet was wonderful. Ate a bit too much though. Service great too, we had a wonderful waiter who was as delighted as me that I loved his recommendation - the omelette
5
Welcoming staff ushering you to a table with FRESHLY squeezed orange juice, with a newspaper in hand is an ideal way to commence the day.A six course degustation breakfast for someone who usually has two long blacks made this extended breakfast feast an indulgent pleasure. A most engaging manager who shared both his personal and hotel tales made it even more enjoyable.The cabinet of tiffin boxes was a bonus when re visiting each course...Only one short coming, barista classes would enhance the coffee...but that is everywhere in the city. Easily dispensed with whilst relishing what was done exceptionally well. My friend ordered eggs, she raved and she is a chef. What better recommendation 
1
Each time I called the Tiffin Room it was never possible for tea until today and such a disappointment!For about $256 (after a 25% Citibank card discount) for 5 pax we were presented with 2x3 tier English tea. set. comprising - lower tray sandwiches (egg, tuna, salmon and cucumber I think)- middle tray of simple, forgettable cakes- highest tray of equally forgettable mini tarts- nearby small round table with a few baskets of local dimsum fare- a longer table of neatly cut local fruits- oh, and sighting of 2 birds flying above us probably because there is a nest in the ceiling somewhereI conclude - we feel ripped off!A distasteful weekend.Bye bye Old DameNever again

My wife & I decided to splash out & have an evening at Raffles Hotel whilst in Singapore. What a great decision! First of all, we went into the Long Bar for the obligatory Singapore Sling. Deicious but very pricy at £15 each! Very busy around 7.30pm but full of bustle & atmosphere. A "must do" when in Singapore, if nothing else. After one each, we went in search of the Tiffin Room which is at the front of the hotel by the main entrance. We were shown to our table and introduced to our waiter Maxime - an exceptionally polite & attentive young man. The curry buffet this evening was really extensive; all shapes & sizes of starters, main courses and desserts. A feast for the eye as well as the palate! There was a vast array of main courses, all beautifully presented & piping hot. One of those meals where you are totally spoilt for choice so end up having a little of everything. There were at least 6 or 7 meat dishes & loads of differet rice & veg. Naan, paratha etc was freshly cooked to order. The extensive Indian desserts were to die for! Maxime, our waiter, couldn`t have been more attentive if he had tried. Every time you got up for a refill he was there to pull your chair out, fold your napkin and re-seat you when you came back. He took time to talk & make you feel at home even though busy. His attention to detail, knowledge and attitude were second to none. If you fancy a really nice curry in a beautiful setting with superlative service, look no further. Be sure to ask for Maxime & you wont be disappointed, but be warned - he is only there for another 5 months before moving on to continue his training somewhere else. A definite loss for Raffles!In summary; not cheap but well worth the money. A memory that will stay forever

What a truly dreadful experience ... From the queue to enter ... By a side door ... Main entrance refused to afternoon tea guests ... To the poor response to our complaint about the service and quality of food ... This was the worst afternoon tea experience I have ever had ... It could not have been more different to browns in London . The staff were rude and poorly trained ... The food frankly too poor to be worthy of comment .. The management disinterested .... Afternoon tea guests are treated with contempt . To add insult to injury one of our party tried the vegetarian dumplings that were on offer ... To they discover it was stuffed with prawns !!! Its time for raffles to stop serving ..
1
Booking for one person, table set for two, food plate put on table, instructed to go to buffet, 20mins before I was offered , two choices from a huge pot, 25 mins before I was offered a scone, one waiter serving 28people! Large group next to me absorbed all his time, I wanted champagne I didn't even get offered it , like a converse belt with all the people in the room, so so disappointing

We were really looking forward to our treat of afternoon tea.It was going to be the highlight of our trip to Singapore.On arrival you are half greeted like second class citizens as you have to line up to go in to the Tiffin room. While waiting ouside we noticed small sparrow like birds within the dinning room even sitting on the white table linen. Once we had sat down we realised that they are residents birds and their chicks ( approx 12 in total) they sit on the light fittings and cornice areas. ( my belief is that they carry germs and diseases and they can randomly put bird poo anywhere...sorry to be so blunt... but this is plain English to me!)The service was poor, we had to ask for the sugar 3 times. The waitress re filled by husband cup and never offered me any! Then when I eventually asked for some tea, the waitress went to 4 tables before our and eventually filled mine up, only to find she had run out! She never offered to return with a fresh pot.The food was very nice, but possibly more variety of savoury would have been nice.I feel I had to share my views on Tripadvisor , but I would seriously think about having a cocktail in the hotels Long Bar and forget the afternoon tea.A trip to Raffles is an experience not to be missed so just head to the bar

You canät go to Singapore without a visit to the Raffles. As this was our first time to Singapore, we went for afternoon tea. Do make a reservation, as it is quite often fully booked. It was a good experience and just seeing the architecture and hotel from the inside was great. The food was fine, probably not worth the price alone, but with the service, location and music - we had a good time
3
A vast selection of food and of good quality however the whole dining experience was a little odd. Three chefs specials in addition to the buffet were provided direct from the kitchen and these just seemed to arrive when suited the kitchen!!! If you wanted to enjoy hot you needed to stop what you were eating and this for us was appetisers!!!A reservation enabled us to get into Raffles and it was great to see the inside of this beautiful building. There was nothing particularly wrong with the meal but it was overpriced and now having been inside Raffles I would not go again
5
The curry buffet in the tiffin room provides good value for money (about £30 each). We had enjoyed this buffet in 2008 and were looking forward to this return visit in 2013. We were not disappointed. Knowing how much delicious choice is on offer we took our time over lunch and ate enough for the whole day! Plenty of choice with starters, mains and desserts. The wine is sooooo expensive and added about £50 to the bill (the cheapest bottle). But we lingered over lunch and went for it. You could keep cost down if you stick to water!book well in advance.We were staying at The Fullerton which we loved as a hotel...the curry buffet at raffles though seems far far better having cast our eye over the fullerton on
5
We enjoyed our evening meals in the Tiffin room.....staff were helpful....and discreet.....and service was quick.....
2
The food was ok, but nothing to crave about, although they do have a great range of teas'. Other than that, the experience was 'normal'...No 'Wow's"
5
The staff were attentive and made you feel special. Cecille was excellent too. The room is quite exquisite and in the afternoons High Tea may be taken there.
5
The curry evening at the Tiffin room was second to none...a delicious three course meal in beautiful surroundings with excellent, friendly service! Definately worth trying and worth every penny,
3
This was our second high tea at the Tiffin Room, after going there in 2009. This time, the food was very disappointing. The service and setting are wonderful, but we found the food to be quite ordinary. And we were particularly annoyed when we paid the bill to find that the advertised price did not include taxes and service charges, ans so the plain afternoon tea was over $200 for three adults. Only go for the ambiance and service of this lovely hotel 
4
I was told that High Tea at Raffles is a must do event at Singapore, so I booked myself a table and came here.While I was quickly shown to the table, it took the waiters a while to realise I was at my table. However after they realised this, they were always prompt to serve me and was ready to fill my drinks and plates.The food was nice, but not exceptional. There are some western type pastries, such as small cakes and cookies, as well as Asian foods such as steamed dumplings. However, the variety was not huge and I would've been happy with just what was on the three-tiered high tea serving plate.However, the ambience and the mood kicked this experience from just average to very good!Warning: just because they said that the cost of the High Tea is $SGD58, there's also a service charge and tax to add to it
5
Took a lively toddler here for tea just before Chistmas with great trepididation but it was wonderful. They made him SO welcome - put him in a matching Colonial style high chair right by the harpist which fascinated him. Food and ambience delightful too. A great family outing
5
Look no further. The spread here is fit for a Indian Prince or Princess. Yes it is a little bit on the expensive side but it is Raffles after all. The quality of the lunch bufffet here is second to none. Hot and cold appetizers as well as an amazing selection of main dishes. Seafood, meat and Vegetarian tastes are all catered for. It is not overly spiced if that is your worry! To round off a meal try the home made pistachio ice cream which will blow you away. All of it should be washed down with an ice cold Indian beer. The service and staff are excellant. Nothing I can fault here.If you are not staying at Raffles and want to experience the hotel atmosphere at its best skip the "Sling" at the long bar and put the money saved towards a curry lunch or dinner. You wont be disappointe
5
First of all I am not sure why this restaurant is spelled on TripAdvisor as "Tiffan Room". There is no such a thing: instead is called "Tiffin Room". It wouldn't hurt to change the header because it may not be easy to find it while browsing.Second of all, you go to this place surely for the food, but also because you are at the Raffles Hotel. The atmosphere and ambience are... "Raffles". One of a kind. The whole building has a character that belongs to a time gone, but luckily you can still get a sense of an long past era while walking through the corridors and the spaces of this magnificent place.The food was good as expected. The service was outstanding, as you would always wanted it to be in any upper class restaurant. The waiter that attended to us was refined, competent, with a nice sense of humour and very knowledgeable.Since it is a buffet, pace yourself and careful not to get carried away because it is easy to forget how much you eat as you enjoy the evening with your company between a drink and the other
5
What an amazing afternoon. The setting is just perfect - quintessentially English setting with lush tropical garden on view through the windows. Absolutely delicious treats and LOTS of them. Unlimited cups of tea or coffee - not inexpensive but really very good value, especially compared to some venues here in Australia that offer a high te
5
staff and chief provided personal service and worked to make us v welcome. Providing for our special needs was their pleasure
5
Amazing service. A good high tea at a high price. But fun fun fun. Buffet options tasty too. My wife and I loved it! Amazing hotel with tons of history. Check it out.

The presentation is lovely but the food is disappointing. The Belgian waffles and Eggs Benedict especially so.
4
The beautifully lit Tiffin Room is a fitting place for a feast. There was a wonderful selection of Indian food, all served in huge gleaming silverware. Everything I tried was delicious. My only complaint would be that there was not a chicken curry on that night, or maybe it had all gone by the time I got there. The service is great and my abiding memory will be of the little carved doll's chairs that they bring for you to rest your handbag on! The Tiffin Room is very impressive and a great place to take visitors to Singapore. NB Trip Advisor it is Tiffin not Tiffan
2
Raffles high Tea, was a major disappointment, very poor experience, despite reading a good New York Times review before going to the Raffles afternoon tea. Many better places have a much better atmosphere and , quality. it was overpriced, & living on past reputation. Sad such a good historic name has let its standards fall so much....Avoid
5
We booked Afternoon Tea in the Tiffin Room on-line from the UK for our Saturday in Singapore and lined up in the short queue for 3.30pm to be greeted by friendly and smartly dressed staff. Escorted to our table for an afternoon tea experience like no other!! Celebration champagne with exquisite pastries, cakes & sandwiches from our tiered cake stand. But that wasnt all, we also enjoyed a hot self-service meal plus fruit and larger cake slices from a huge selection on offer. In general we though the whole experience well worth the money with only one minor gripe - the hotel ask that Tiffin Room guests abide by a reasonable dress code which most abide by to make the experience special but this is often substantially 'relaxed' by hotel staff, presumably not to offend the paying public. Might be worth Raffles management giving some thought on how to police this?On the Sunday we made the Long Bar pilgrimage for peanuts and Singapore Sling - who cares what it costs, it has to be done. The bar was packed but what a place to 'people watch' while enjoying Singapore's most famous alcoholic offering....... As an aside, the Raffles souvenir shop is well worth a visit to
5
You have to go to Raffles when in Singapore. My husband saw the menu in advance and (being a bit picky) didn't like any of the sandwiches. Not a problem, as he was presented with nice plain sandwiches even he liked. You certainly don't leave hungry and the service was impeccable. The grounds are beautiful for a stroll and I would definitely say it was worth every penny for high tea
3
Raffles to me is a lovely elegant location, and I was very excited once I booked in for high tea - which was very easy to do online using their reservation service. My session was at 3.30pm and while I'll say the staff were very attentive, it was not easy to find the entrance we were to use for the Tiffin room. I also didn't enjoy queuing outside in the heat while they checked customers in, but to be fair this probably didn't take as long as I thought (it was hot so it's possible I was just overwhelmed by the heat).I loved that my handbag got its own seat and my table had magazines... & the staff were lovely. I didn't particularly enjoy the sandwiches and wasn't really interested in the dumplings, but the tea and scones were nice and the jam was delicious. For $68SGD I'd say you are paying for the legend of the location but I knew that before I went so no surprises there. Definitely a one time experience for me
4
Having had the obligatory cocktail in the Long Bar last time thought we would try Afternoon Tea. It was beautifully presented and more than ample for two people .I did feel that tea could have been refreshed a little more readily but the food was delicious. The buffet also had a good range to select from. The setting was wonderful
5
Of course Raffles is a must. With residence a bit out of our price range though we could not stay here for the four days we were in Singapore end of Sept/begin of Oct. However, we did go for afternoon tea in the Tiffin Room at Raffles and what a delight it was. Dim sum was superb and as a Brit who has a bit of a passion for afternoon tea the tea and cakes didn't disappoint either. Of course I would have definitely preferred they served loose tea but with the abundance of other goodies on offer I certainly left more than happy
3
Buffet didn't seem to have as many items as we remembered and the food was not very hot and some items needed refilling
5
Getting into Raffles through the front door (if you don't stay there) is a challenge. They filter people because everyone else wants a photo taken in the famous lobby. But we got in by asking to make a booking in the Tiffin Room.It was tea time and didn't expect to find a table; but our request was taken, a table laid out and we were escorted to somethng wonderful.On the table was a tiered plate, with sandwiches, cakes and cookies. There were three pots of tea, milk and crockery (of course). The place was packed out.Our daughter has a nut allergy. We pointed this out to the attentive staff and the chef prepared some nut free alternatives for her.At around Â£30 each, it was expensive - but outsttanding value just for the experience
5
A visit to the Raffles Hotel should be on everyone's 'must do' list for Singapore. It is possible to visit the hotel, wander through the lovely breezeways and gardens, visit the Raffles museum and shop without splashing any cash, but on this visit to Singapore we booked in for High Tea at the Tiffin Room. This is available daily from 3.30pm - 5.30pm. It is very advisable to book, which I was able to do via phone using the international number on the Raffles website. I booked for 3.30pm, wanting to have a the maximum amount of time. This was not the best idea as, of course, it is the same idea everyone else has - this means you have to queue to go into the restaurant. It would have been better to book for 4pm when we could have been seated straight away and would still have had a good amount time for eating and soaking up the atmosphere. Once seated at our table we were offered a glass of Champagne - this is not included in the High Tea price and was $20++. That was a bit pricey for me, though I am sure it was good champagne. We opted for the traditional English Breakfast tea. We were travelling in a group of four adults and two children. On being seated at our table, complete with linen tablecloth and Raffles china, we were brought tea and the server explained that our three tier tray of sandwiches and cakes would be brought shortly. We were also welcome to help ourselves to the buffet which consisted of fruit, dim sums and cakes. The three tier tray had one plate of sandwiches - tuna, salmon, egg, cucumber and roast beef - very traditional - plus two plates of delicate little cakes and pastries - the chocolate eclair and raspberry cupcake were my favourites. We did try the dim sums as well, but I rather wished I hadn't as when we finished our sandwiches we were offered another tray so we had plenty to eat without the buffet. In fact we were so full when we left we didn't need dinner. Our cups of tea were filled up regularly by attentive servers who were always at hand.Our group agreed it was a lovely afternoon outing. The room itself is large, bright, painted a stunning white throughout and stylishly decorated. The renovation of the Raffles definitely restored its former glory. It is an iconic place and well worth a visit - do wear your best outfits and you will feel glamour of of this historic building and that you are little part of its long history
5
I had dinner with two friends, and arrived a few minutes early. The restaurant- a beautiful room off the reception of the Raffles - was almost empty. As soon as i sat down the waitress brought me a magazine to look at while i was waiting, and ensured i had water and a drink as soon as possible. Service was great, polite and very friendly, throughout the whole meal. We choose the buffet option, which offered a nice variety of dishes, all cooked wonderfully, and with a nice blend of flavours. Unusually for indian food, I absolutely loved the dessert selection, so leave some room for it
1
I expected more than tea bags on the side of a pot of water (not hot) served by unfriendly staff, AND for a cost of 14 S$. Skip tea here and head to Pollen in Gardens by the Bay where the friendly staff serve delicious tea with petit fours for 9.50 S$
5
Fine china, silverware, cucumber sandwiches, cakes, scones, jam, clotted cream, tea made with tea leaves, white table cloths, comfortable chairs - it could be the Dorchester in London - except there's a veritable feast of Dim Sum and Asian goodies to complement this most British of traditions.East meets West - and the result is delight
5
This was definitely a highlight in Singapore. High Tea in the Tiffin Room is a step back to a grander, more elegant time. The experience is not about the sandwiches but about the history and the tradition. This is not to say the food was not good - it was excellent, and the bonus champagne to celebrate Raffle's 125th birthday was lovely. It's always busy so pre-book a couple of days ahead.My suggestion is to go there early and walk the grounds, tour the museum (3rd floor) and get a real understanding about Raffles and what it stands for - then you will enjoy the experience of High Tea that much more. And it is worth every cent (or about $80pp). Enjoy
2
As other reviewers have written, this is basically buffet food at 5 star prices. Here is my summary:Pros:-The hotel itself is lovely-The Tiffin Room is a nice setting, but not greatCons:- Sandwiches were dry and the contents of which were poor and certainly not value for money- Even with a reservation, you have to queue outside before entering; this is not elegant and resembles a cafe. They must do something to address this as people were left stood in the heat for 10mins whilst they worked through the queue.-Service was bland, rehearsed and medicore, it didn't deliver anything out of the ordinary-It took them 15 minutes before our glass of champagne was delivered and we had to ask for the tea to be brought over- The taste of the food was also bland and certainly isn't worth of the 68 dollar charge; 78 including champagne.I really had high expectations prior to arriving, however was left completely disappointed.Sorry
5
This was an amazing experience. You are instantly transformed back 100 years as soon as you enter the Tiffin Room. Afternoon tea was faultless, from the service to the food and drink. I will definitely be heading back here on my next trip. Wonderful to be part of it all
5
When I prebooked afternoon tea at the Tiffin Room at Raffles I had no idea that Prince William and Kate would be there at the same time. It was a bit disappointing that we had to enter through the back door due to security, but the experience inside made up for it. It somehow felt "right" having Royalty there.The service was outstanding and the food was excellent. Having read other reviews of stale sandwiches etc. we were pleased to be able to say this wasn't the case. We had the cake stand with a variety of sandwiches, cakes and pastries, there was a hot buffet, and the staff came around every few minutes with scones, eclairs etc. We were given champagne with our High Tea which seemed a little odd, but I wasn't complaining. I loved the experience of High Tea and would recommend this to anyone. It was expensive but worth it
5
Breakfast and High Tea a must, silver service and delightful friendly staff. Be sure to book for High Tea
5
Friendly staff who let you browse and are willing to help without being pushy - love the old fashioned distinguished style of the shop decor and layout.
4
Book in advance especially for weekends. An amazing high tea experience with plenty of food. You wont leave disappointed.

Located in the regal settings of the Raffles Hotel, eating at the Tiffin room takes you back to the days of the British rules 'Raj' in India. Food is exquisitely laid out and is made for the delicate western palate that appreciates Indian flavours but does not like an over empowering sense of numbness with the spices. Ambience and price is targeted at the elite crowd and hence being on a corporate account would be a great way to check this place out ! Nice ...
3
The Raffles Hotel for all it's pomp and grandeur suffers with dreadful service throughout and the Tiffin Room is no exception. It is a shame but the setting is fantastic and the food is pretty decent also.The problem is you are left constantly grappling with non existent staff who either won't take your order or won't bring it. Considering they are only having to deal with drinks and bread due to the buffet format, it is entirely dreadful and spoils what could be an otherwise excellent experience
2
Buffet food is not posh or tasty. Its cheap bulk food put on a heater for hours on end. Its not cooked for you personaly and could have been sat there for hours. Both the breakfast and indian meal we had here were not good quality
4
Make sure you pre book and be prepared to pay approx S$75 per person. We were surprised when we got there at our booked time that we had to line up and wait to be seated. It was an experience you would expect from Sizzler in Australia. Once we were in though the service was great. The real surprise was after they brought over the high tea to the table they advised that more food was available from the buffet including dumplings and more sweets. The food was great but it lacked a truly high tea experience
5
We have already raved about Raffles Hotel elsewhere, but we chose the Tiffin Room to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary during a stopover on the way home from Australia to the UK.The Tiffin Room is where Raffles usually runs breakfast in the morning but - at least while we were there - it was a buffet dinner with an Indian theme every night. We usually hate buffets because there is always someone right behind you who puts pressure on you to get out of the way, but at the Tiffin Room it was much more decorous, polite, and restrained. The food was magnificent and for once I didn't need half a gallon of indigestion liquid when I went to bed afterwards. It was never over-spicy but remained distinctly indian with plenty of choice, including vegetarian. It was a three-course dinner, or as many course as you like actually! The naan bread was thin and delightful, and even the Indian desserts (usually a no-no with us) were a pleasure. Can't be sure, but I think it was S$65 per person - roughly the equivalent of the US Dollar, and by no means over-expensive. The staff were superb, of course
2
There was a time, for years, when this was the very best place in Singapore for a curry buffet. The selection was generous and the food quality was exceptional. An excellent buffet has to be excellent in all three areas - hors d'oeuvre, mains and dessert. Tiffin Room had all this in a gorgeous setting but is no longer the place to go for the food based on my recent experience. The hors d'oeuvres were average in selection and quality. Presentation was quite poor in that several platters were nearly empty yet no effort was made to replenish them. This was at 8.15pm and restaurant was not even a quarter full. The mains were quite good, some average, nothing was bad but there wasn't anyone around to explain the dishes, given that Indian food is quite complex and the tiny description cards hardly say anything. Dessert was awful. To be fair, Indian desserts only suit certain palates but there was nothing else on offer. I remember having a selection of western desserts in the past, when i went quite regularly. Not any more. The bread and butter pudding looked like slices of bread soaking in milk and was nothing like the western pudding. Even the ice-cream was Indian kulfi, spiced. It was all soft an creamy as it had not been kept cold. the chef replaced it reluctantly with another kulfi. When i asked if it was possible to get some dessert from another restaurant, maybe just a small slice of cake or pudding, as none of us in my family of 4 ate Indian desserts, the answer was a flat "no." The naan was good and so was the tandoori lamb that was brought to the table. That was pretty much the highlight for us, aside from the ambience.For S$75++, it was vastly over-priced. If they keep up this selection, and are so unhelpful with alternatives for dessert, they will be struggling to get repeat customers. Sadly, this hotel can afford to rely solely on guests so I think things will not get better for residents like me.I am giving this a miss in the future. too many other great places to eat for much less cost
1
We booked a table for 12 on a Sunday afternoon . The rep never mentioned about dress code. When we entered the restaurant the hostess was rude and insisted on a formal dress . What was even worse is that they insisted that I wear pants provided by them. It was just a customer service. The food was not that great either. It was terrible. None of us will return
5
Very well catered breakfast. Service was excellent, given both as a la carte with buffet selection. The room is beautiful, stunning colonial architecture.

When checking into the Raffles, pick the bed and breakfast option.

Afternoon tea at Raffles Hotel is a must if visiting Singapore and a glass of champagne with it goes down very well. There is a lovely selection on the buffet ranging from scones with jam and cream, cakes and pastries, oriental savouries and fresh fruit. A selection of sandwiches and cakes is also plated and brought to your table. Yes, it is quite expensive for what it is but still a very enjoyable experience and I would suggest you make a reservation as it is very popular

Book well in advance. Ambience was nice and food good but not great. Our teenage daughter has a nut allergy and when asking which sweet items contained nuts we were told bluntly all of them. I asked if they could check on the scones to which they said they too contained nuts! I have never heard of any scones being made with nuts! It ruined the experience with our daughter being unable to eat anything but the sandwiches. Never had this happen anywhere else with high tea or in cake shops for that matter. The Peninsula in Hong Kong couldn't have been more helpful when asked the same questions. It is just usually explained that items may have been exposed to nut residue if its prepared in the same kitchen area but does not physically contain nuts. Will not go back and nor would we stay here after that experience

Recently tried the buffet curry lunch on a return visit to the TIffin Room having had the High Tea previously. The curries were exquisite, the service first class and the desserts were...well let's just say I had a lot of gulag jamans. This was followed by a long sit on the verandah in the cool breezes. Expensive yes after wine, bread and water purchased but an experience to remember and highly recommended as a bucket list item. I felt special to be there and loved the ambiance and the friendliness of all the staff. Treat this as a must do experience and enjoy it for the opulence that it is

One of the best breakfasts we have experienced in a hotel. Not the cheapest, but the quality was definitely their. Fantastic service, excellent food, and beautiful location. The buffet had just about everything you could desire, but on top of that, they cooked your breakfast to meet your request
1
First time having high tea where you got the tea by the cup. Eventually got a minuscule pot. No choice of tea. We got up one time to get our own tea. Extra sandwiches took two requests and 20 minutes The chocolate was the best part. It seems as if every 3-tier stand had been used in a fencing match -- everything bent out of shape. The management needs to go to the Ritz in London to see how tea is done. Recommendation is to skip high tea at Raffles
2
My Daughter and I had high tea at Raffles and it was very disappointing. We wouldn't have minded paying the $70 SD cost per person if it had been something to remember. The food was below average and service was also poor. Who serves tea bag tea at a High Tea and only a choice of two types of tea?- the Raffles Hotel do. We had to wait 10 minutes and ask for a second cup of tea. I would advise anyone to save your money and don't go
4
I arrived in Singapore in the morning and was flying out in the evening. With tastebuds wrecked by the long-haul flight a curry was the perfect antidote so this buffet-style Tiffin was a great way to refuel the inner man as well as experiencing one of Singapore's most iconic detsinations
4
I had a couple of breakfasts at the Tiffin Room during my recent stay at Raffles. It gets 4 stars only because it is mildly expense for breakfast, but everything else was flawless and elegant from the service to the dishes. Both in variety and quality everything was terrific and very well prepared
5
For Breakfast -- selection and service are first rate. Go for the buffet.
5
Went to High Tea in the Tiffin room at raffles hotel. Was such a lovely setting. Service was superior. Food was high quality. Thoroughly enjoyable afternoon. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Singapore.
5
The setting, the decorations, the elegance, plus the friendly and excellent service. High Tea in the Tiffin Room is must.Breakfast is also served here and the selection and quality of the food was very good.
5
Excellent choice for breakfast served by courteous and professional staff.
5
i think it is a wonderful place to eat here, as the environment is very nice

Ok there is a lot to choose from as it's a buffet. It was Indian food which I love but the food looked over cooked and dried out as if it had been yesterday's (and probably the day before that) just reheated. The salad/lettuce tray had hardly anything on it and what there was was so limp and looked like it should have been thrown away ages ago. There was a raita with dumplings but it was only sauce, when I asked the waiter about it he agreed there were no dumplings in it and called out the Chef. It was obvious he wasn't going to do anything and he told me the dumplings were very small.....umm they must have been invisible too! The waiting staff were lovely. The wine list is terrible, hardly any choice, for a hotel with such distinction this is a poor state of affairs. When we got back to the hotel my husband soon felt unwell and had a dodgy stomach all night and the next morning too, thank heavens I ate different things to him. We have spent a month in Singapore and this is the first restaurant we have had problems with, and the most expensive! If you want a good buffet meal pop around the corner to the Grand Park City Hall where their food is fresh and you have a much better choice
2
The desserts and Dim Sum were good, but the service was horrible. We waited 20 min for tea and sandwich/dessert tray. We never received refills on tea or water. In fact, the server never returned after dropping off the initial service. We asked 4 times and waited 20 minutes for our check. St. Regis looks better, has live music and a dancing fountain and is a bit less - going there next time. Shame on Raffles for providing such poor service in so elegant and lovely a setting
3
We were looking forward to a really memorable experience - instead we came away talking about what it might have been and how it could have been improved. On the plus side the food was varied and plentiful and the staff were perfectly pleasant. However there was absolutely no WOW factor. We did not appreciate being told rather abruptly to join the queue outside, despite having booked the day before. There was no choice of tea offered and no hot water for a refill. Instead when we asked for more tea, an entirely different blend was brought, seemingly at random. It was quite expensive at 136 Singapore dollars for two. We did not expect to be treated like royalty but we did expect a more civilised experience. Would we go back? No. If you simply must go to Raffles, just take a wander round the garden area and visit the hotel museum. Otherwise spend your money elsewhere. Singapore has a great deal more to offer than this rather perfunctory experience
1
We were so excited about coming here, we have had high tea from The Dorchester in London to The Alvear Palace in Buenos Aires and this was so far behind the pack it was incredible. Only 4 tea's on offer and the waitress couldn't even remember those. A very plain and average teared tray arrived with soggy sandwiches and a few small sweet cakes. Everything else had to be gotten from a buffet, fighting through piles of screaming children to get there. We had to ask if champagne was on offer. We received an email from Raffles telling us the dress code and recommended attire, so we specifically dressed up, only to arrive and be surrounded by people wearing t-shirts, jeans and sneakers. Why did we even bother. The room was lovely and generally so were the staff, but this was a very expensive day that was not worth it at all. This is not the high tea it once was. We tried to cheer ourselves up with a Singapore Sling at the Long Bar afterwards and it was equally bad
2
We had high tea on a Saturday. This place reminded me of a cafeteria with the clinking of dishes and a buffet that the guests ran to get to. Our waiter was clueless on the selections of tea available and spent his time talking us up to buy expensive drinks. When asked about the tea selections, our waiter simply did not know. The place was filled with tourists who appeared to have not eaten in days. You should stay out there way or risk being knocked over. The establishment seems to cater to large groups rather than individuals. Avoid this unless you want to see the room itself which is nice. There are much better places in town
5
The service and the food quality are both typical of the Raffles Hotel. We particularly enjoyed the Indian Buffet, which was more varied than we could have imagined.
2
Maybe my expectations were too high. Being treated like some servant and sent to the side entrance may also have had an impact. The view of the simple sandwiches on the centre plate on each table started sounding the alarm bells. Then we were allowed to enter and be seated. The restaurant was large and nice but nothing to rave about. Fortunately there was more food in a self serve area and I must admit the scones, jam and cream were just like being in England.Is it worth it? Value for money No. Visiting a place of considerable interest. Maybe.The best part is a walk around the garden and outside bar as non guests are not allowed inside the hotel (although you can seek into the hotel once in the restaurant).Suggestion. Save your money and book a meal on top of the Marina Bay Sands. The lift price will be included with the meal and the view is fantastic
2
We were looking forward to high tea at Raffles as a highlight of our trip and as someone who loves the concept of 'afternoon tea' and has been lucky enough to have tasted some all around the world we were so disappointed.Firstly, making everyone queue outside the side entrance whilst they tick your name of a list doesn't make you feel like you are being pampered thankfully it wasn't raining hard! After being shown to your seat there is already a service tray of sandwiches - very basic and small cakes that are not at all beautifully presented but looking somewhat plain. Instantly you sit down the waiter arrives - with tea? no - a selling point! The champagne upgrade is sold at the table and we found the waiter to be very pushy (we felt they were probably on commission for this). my daughter ordered a mocktail to start and we waited over 20 minutes for it to arrive. There is no real ambience. Normally high tea is served to a piano or similar background music but all that was playing was piped music and not relaxing. The service was slow - we had to ask for refills on our tea three times and had to send it back the first time as it was like water - no flavour or colour. The china was not china -plain white and chunky not at all elegant as you would expect.The rest of the tea is a buffet service with a Dimsum table and fresh fruit table. we agreed the best thing was the scones but the 'clotted cream' definately isn't. The bread and butter pudding was more like a custard mousse but the chocolate gateaux was nice.Overall, we would definately not be recommending this experience to anyone, overpriced and overated. Better to go to the Goodwood Park for their afternoon tea buffet - cheaper and food quality was much better
5
I've visited the Tiffin room twice, in November 2011 and in January 2012. The Indian curry buffet is so good! It has lots of items for us vegetarians as well, which is not at all usual, not even in Singapore. The lovely service is worth mentioning as well, as is the general decor of the Raffles. I highly recommend the Tiffin room for dinner
1
There is nothing extra to say other than to say we would have been better off having High Tea at our Hotel.....Go and have a look at the Hotel,but take my advice and and keep your money in your pocket.Should be charged with theft !!Poor Food ,Poor Servic
1
Having booked a table for 8.30pm beware!!! By 9.50 pm we felt as though we were not wanted... Tables cleared around us and reset for Breakfst.It was supposed to be special occasion as it was my Wife's BirthdayWe saw the food and beverage manager to explain it was not what we expected from what is supposed to be the best hotel in Singapore.Rather than acknowledge our concerns he was condescending and at the end of the discussion chose to discuss openly in front of us with a waitress that we had the affront to complain.....If you want a good meal and wish to feel that you are wanted as as a customer avoid this restaurant at all costs.No wonder in such a vibrant city as Singapore the restaurant was not at all busy... Perhaps we should have taken the hint...Apologies to the staff themselves who were polite but evidently not up to the standards required of a 5* hote

Ooops, what happened to the traditional afternoon tea at the Raffles hotel? On my first trip to Singapore, about 25 years ago, I enjoyed a truly great afternoon tea at the Raffles. Now I wanted to repeat the experience. Unfortunately, everything has changed. No longer plays somebody the harp or the piano. The three plate with rather average sandwiches, mini cakes and chocolate mousse already on your table when you arrive, a buffet for cake, scones and fruits has the atmosphere of a breakfast buffet at an average 3-star hotel. All very mass production. The tea itself was very bland, almost like 'one flavour fits all'. Nothing that's worth the price of SGD 68. I simply cannot hide my disappointment
3
This is probably one of those tourist experiences where it is nice to say you have been and our group certainly enjoyed the experience of High Tea at Raffles.However don't go expecting any culinary delights or special or exotic teas. The three tier food stand on our table consisted of some rather uninspiring white bread sandwiches, some sickly pink cakes and some mini chocolate mousses. There was also a buffet with scones and dim sims and some other cakes and fruit. So there was plenty of food. However the quality of the cakes and pastry was disappointing. The standard of these little mini delights at high tea should be at patisserie level, but these were pretty pedestrian. Even more disappointing was the tea selection - English Breakfast, Earl Grey, Jasmine and one other. Raffles should check out the tea selection and indeed the whole menu and presentation at high tea at the Observatory Hotel in Sydney. There are some spectacular and exotic teas from India and Sri Lanka and Malaysia, which are a delight to try. There is also an interesting and delicious spread of cakes, scones and sandwiches and pastries.So by all means go to Raffles High Tea for the experience which we loved, but be aware that the cost is high and the food and drinks are not that special
4
My husband and I booked for the Tiffin Room at Raffles as the last of out 'to do's" in Singapore.The room was beautiful, the staff attentive, the tea was lovely. However when we were seated our three tiered selection of pastries and sandwiches was laready sitting at the table. Naturally the sandwiches had dried out a little which was a disappointment.The small hot buffet of assorted dumplings etc was nice and the scones with jam and clotted cream were delicious.A very grand atmosphere let down a by the food and it's presentation. I would have to say that High Tea at the QVB in Sydney serves better pastries and sandwiches
4
Never able to afford to actually stay here we make do with a walk round he premises,in the gift shop and nose in the long bar...prebooked on line for afternoon tea in the Tiffin Room...pricey at over £30 per head for copious pots of tea and a large selection of sandwiches,cakes and local spicy/rice dishes it remains one of the must do's whilst in Singapore.....staff are friendly and will offer to take your picture with your camera...you do not feel hurried and all attempts to actually eat your £60 odd worth of food is not discouraged but clearly is impossible! I am sure our next trip will take us in for our fourth tea time in the Tiffin Room
4
The breakfast was great and the staff attentive and eager
4
We enjoyed having breakfast here but avoided it for the high tea, electing to have this elsewhere in the hotel.
5
Absolutely fabulous ... everything - the service, the champagne, the harpist, the decor, the buffet, the tea!
5
I emailed Raffles Hotel several months ago and booked a table for High Tea in Mid-February. Very nice ambiance, attentive and friendly staff. plenty of food - 3 tier stand on each table, plus a buffet of sweets, tropical fruits, and dim sum. The scones, jam and clotted cream were excellent. Lovely coffee served in an old silver coffee pot with Raffles Hotel engraved on it. Very expensive SGD$68 (Australian$50), but it was a once in a lifetime experience and I enjoyed it immensely
1
I love afternoon tea. Everywhere I travel, its a must. But, this last visit to Singapore was a huge disapointment. First of all, since it was the holiday time, I emailed and made the reservation two months in advance. They asked for a credit card guarantee, which I gave them. Next thing I know, they CHARGED my credit card for the tea. Two months in advance? And its not like I was booking an $800 room. Anyway, dutifully, we showed up for tea. It was in the Tiffin Room. It was the coldest experience you could have. The tea was average, the pastries dry and the service way below what one would expect from a First Class Hotel. To top it off, when the bill came, the glass of wine we ordered... $50 a glass. After the most uninspired tea ever, we decided to look around the gardens. They looked dry and boring. We went to the restrooms and the smell was so bad, we left. Absolutely the worst experience
4
The curry tiffin buffet is authentic and more than sufficiently varied, and the tea is similarly good. But if I were the management of the hotel, I would make this my 'signature' restaurant, and provide an experience that surpasses expectations, rather than barely fulfilling them. It's better than OK; the staff are marvelous, but it could be so much more
3
This curry buffet at lunch time, advertised by the hotel as a "hot favorite for tourists", is just that. Food is good and acceptable, but for every dish I eat here I could find an equally good street variety at a fraction of the price. But then, I'd have to run all over town..
5
Part of Raffles Hotel and therefore you expect a high standard and that's what you get. The variety of curry on offer accompanied by everything you could wish for as an accompaniment is better than anywhere I've ever been. Add to that impeccable service and it makes a perfect experience that's worth trying assuming you like Indian food.
5
An 11 hour transit wait in Singapore found us with time on our hands so we decided to treat ourselves to High Tea at Raffles ... and we weren't disappointed! The staff could not have been more accommodating - even managing to find some trousers for my husband and son to change into (from shorts) so that they met the hotel's dress code.The champagne served easily rivalled Moet (which has been our firm favourite up until now) and the sandwiches and petit fours and buffet was 'to die for'.If you want to try something other than a Singapore Sling while visiting Raffles, I can highly recommend their High Tea
5
Tiffin high tea, very nice and elegant we book a tour, inclusive of tea at Tiffin Room, money very well expended classy, a lady play the harp lovely touch, flutes of champagne all inclusive, if it is true cucumber sandwiches are common on high teas, we came here for the history the traditional elegance the colonialism of the place, not the food all what we expected was full filled, we were able to take pictures, helpful staff
4
good food, but limited variety. Ambience and service very good
5
An amazing experience which I shared with my daughter. Unforgettable, we felt like we were in a bygone era and the high tea was magnificent. A must do!!!
5
What can I say- a great way to enjoy the Raffles Hotel building without staying there. Food was beautifully presented, huge variety and delicious.
3
I had high expectation of this place for it's famous high tea,but to be quite honest the price does not justify for what it was. $55 for a few sandwiches and cakes and they where pretty average. The wait staffare friendly and helpful. Overall the experience was disappointing, this would be recommended for people who love traditional high tea.

The Tiffin Room had best Indian buffet I ever had. It was laid out well and had a huge selection of dishes well-labeled to identify each one. The price of wine is expensive on a personal budget but not on a business expense (whew!). US$65.00 may be expensive for a buffet here in the US but the experience was worth it. Great value. A must for someone visiting Singapore
3
We had high expectations of high tea at Raffles, but left disappointed. The Tiffin Room itself is beautiful to look at but lacked atmosphere. We emailed in advance to arrange a vegetarian high tea and the staff were extremely accomodating and prompt in their responses to our emails. However when we arrived we were given the usual 3 tiered stand, which contained meat items. We did not want to complain and spoil the experience and so did not raise the issue with the staff. Around 20 minutes into the sitting a further 2 plates of food were brought to the table (the vegetarian options that we should have been given in the first place). We were left with more food than we knew what to do with and we felt embarrassed by the awkward exchange. The food itself was unexciting. The 3 tiered stand was not entirely traditional or enticing. The top layer had tartlets and friands (the tarts also forming part of the buffet), 2 cakes on the second tier and sandwiches on the third.The buffet itself contained 2 hot puddings, scones, more tarts, luminous cake and jam, fruit and dim sum. The scones were a highlight but the cakes were unappetising and the options limited. All in all it was standard fare and nothing to write home about. We have had high tea at a number of reputable hotels around the world and Raffles just didn't stack up.Would recommend visiting the Raffles for a drink at one of the hotel bars rather than bothering with high tea - Try one of the other hotels! Considering its reputation and heritage, Raffles could do better
4
One of the best afternoon teas I have had in my life. Great atmosphere and great service. The quality of the food is also fantastic ofcourse. Only downside was that it was completely full at our seating and we had to wait in line for the food most of the time. The selection of the food is limited compared to other hotels but nonetheless it had your western and chinese food. If you are looking for something special in the afternoon, this is 3 hours you will be talking about for a while
5
Firstly I am the last person that would attend a hight tea with pretty cakes, but I thought that when in Rome(or Singapore). This was hands down one the best ways to spend an afternoon in Singapore. Not to mention enjoying a piece of history. We booked a table for 4 at 3:30pm, 2 months in advance just to be sure we got a table. It was $55 per adult, and on arrival we were offered a glass of French Champagne for $20 a glass, 2 of us tried the Champagne and enjoyed. As you would expect there were x2 three tiered trays with Petit fours and endless amounts of tea and coffee of which there was a pot for each of us that never seemed to run out. Come to mention it I dont even remember filling my cup once as the staff were so attentive. On top of all that there was a buffet where you could help yourself to MORE cakes and an array of Asian cakes and steamed dumplings. Cant wait to get back to Singapore for enjoy once again this FANTASTIC & UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE
5
We came here for breakfast at the fabled Raffles Hotel. We were shown to the Tiffin Room, where calm and beauty prevailed. The tables were draped with mint green cloth. The service, like everything we encountered in this restaurant, was extraordinary. Someone to always pull out your chair for you when you return from the sumptuous buffet; someone to have folded your napkin while you were away.The buffet included a la carte selections. The french toast was the best I had hever had. It was thick, with a light crispy surface and soft, though not doughy, filling.On the buffet were fresh fruit, including blueberries and some of the best raspberries we've encountered in Asia. There were fresh honey, juices, danishes, cheeses, salads, cereals and yoghurt. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and the Tiffin Room's got us off to a great start
5
What an experience! Never had afternoon tea like it ever before. So delicious and the service, decore and atmosphere was divine. No the cheapest thing to do in Singapore but very memorable.
5
My wife and I had three breakfasts and one lunch at the Tiffin Room during our stay. The quality of the food is simply top notch. The Indian Buffet is perhaps the most famous such buffet in the world. The cooking methods, range of what is on offer, and quality of the ingredients make it worth it
5
We wanted to celebrate a friend's birthday at Raffles Hotel in Singapore. We decided on the TIffin Room as the price looked more reasonable than the other restaurants in the hotel. We paid about $65.00 US for the buffet but it was well worth the price.This was simply the best Indian food we have every tired. The buffet had a huge selection with labels identifying each dish. The room is lovely and is located just off the lobby of this amazing old hotel. The price of wine and bottled water is expensive but we splurged as we wanted to celebrate our friend's bithday in style. The hotel presented our friend with a lovely little cake. It was so big we offered some to the couple dining at the table next to us. We walked away from dinner very satisfied with our choice and would highly recommend the Tiffin Room to anyone who loves fine Indian dining. Just be prepared to spend more than you might expect , but we think, you will have memorable and enjoyable experience
3
I visited Tiffin Room for a Sunday dinner buffet with my family. The restaurant ambiance is great considering that it is situated within the Raffles Hotel, however, the service wasn't top notch and the food was just about ok, nothing really to rave about, therefore at the rate at which they charge, I didn't find any value given the average quality of the food. Surprisingly, they only had 1 vegetarian soup instead of having one vegetarian and one non-veg. For starters they served 2 non-veg kababs and 2 veggie ones. They also had a salad table which wasn't exciting. The prawns served as a cold salad were slightly rancid and my parents who aren't used to Singaporean style seafood didn't like them at all. They did have a wider variety of main course dishes, with one each in prawns, fish, chicken and lamb. This was served along with chicken biryani, tomato rice and plain rice. The vegetarian spread was equally elaborate, but my wife who is a strict vegetarian, didn't enjoy her meal at all. The difference between the lunch and dinner buffets is that for dinner they serve a portion of chicken curry, mushrooms and Rann (shoulder of lamb cooked dry) on the table. The mushroom and Rann were tasty, the chicken curry was average. The dessert spread was wide, but quite a few of the dishes were either rice based or vermicelli based, the dry sweets such as barfis etc were very mediocre and tasted slightly stale. Their service wasn't all that great, there were only 3 stewards for a restaurant that has at least 20 tables. We had to request for a few things several times before they were brought to our table and on two occasions I had to go and hand over my used plate to the stewards so that I could dine from the new portions that I had served myself from the buffet table. All in all, at $70 for lunch and $87 for dinner, I find the prices quite steep. I would strongly recommend the Saturday buffet ($30) and Sunday brunch ($50) at Yantra. Though their spread may not be as wide, the taste and quality of their food is a lot better
5
We went for the brunch Indian Buffet and it was amazing. The selection of dishes, well presented and hot, were amazing. The made to order variety of Naan breads were fabulous. We live in a city with the largest Indian population outside of India and our Indian restaurants could take some tips from Raffles. The service was terrific. I would definitely recommend splurging on a meal here
4
The Tiffin Room is a family favourite for the ambiance, but not the food. You can get better Indian food in many other places. We go for the opportunbity to return to a past era and get great professional service. In this sense the meal is great as the food is good but not exceptional, although one or two dishes do stand out (fish curry and egg plant)A very pleasant and reasonable evening out
5
You are paying top dollar so you expect the very best of service - you get it (plus a focus on you). You expect immaculate layout, cleanliness and attention to detail - you get it (with a very minimum of fuss). You expect the best ingredients and the proven curry and western dishes - not only do you get it but the chefs are ready to vary the dishes according to your personal taste. What I did not expect was the signature dish at breakfast being their omelette. It was a smooth mix of western & Indian flavours that left me wanting seconds (without telling my doctor). Breakfast in the Tiffin Room at Raffles was so much more than we anticipated. We were in all ages, all periods but we were always allowed to be individual, inquisitive and totally comfortable. Breakfast at Raffles should be on all food lovers' bucket lists
3
The hotel surroundings aside, I found the afternoon tea at Raffles disappointing.We live in Singapore and have tried a number of the dining options at Raffles including the Sunday Brunch, writer's Bar, Royal China, Doc Chengs...and the tea was by far the least impressive.The buffet is all desserts (not made clear in advertisements) which are incredibly rich and fatty. There are no savoury selections aside from the few sandwiches on your table and a measly dim sum platter.The tea is excellent but refills were hard to come by.For a raffles treat, I would recommend the Brunch in the Bar and Billiards room, far more food choices and better value
4
My husband and I had the Curry Buffet for dinner and the food on offer was really good. The service was fantastic but the atmosphere was a little dented by other diners' attire. Raffles' website clearly states the dress code for both men and women and to see people wearing t-shirts was dissappointing (I know, sounds snobbish but had expectations of elegance throughout!). The expense was astronomical (S$30 for a glass of champagne) but as this is Raffles you can't complain.Ultimately, a lovely experience in a gorgeous, historical hotel
2
High tea at the Tiffin room....$330 for 3 adults and a child, with 1 glass of champagne..(Champagne at $15++ per glass)Not only was the service lousy, (waiting 10 minutes for a second cup of tea) you then had to wait another 10 minutes for your plates to be cleared.A very basic buffet, mostly dim sum items, with a couple of sandwiches and cakes, and a couple of cups of tea.Yes, the Raffles Hotel has a fine history.....but the High Tea is just skimming tourists off the back of that name.....Unless you are a history buff, or want to be seen...dont bother
2
Hyped.

So we had dinner there tonight. We are both vegetarian. When they brought out a lamb mince dish and we tell the staff that we are veggie, we might hope they would bring out an alternative. But this wasnt to be.We ordered champagne and had to keep reminding the staff to top up our glasses.And they took away our naan plate before I finished my main course.Frankly if this was Raffles service, I'm not sure I would want to spend SG$700 on a room there
4
Hubby booked High Tea for my birthday. I do love a high tea, but I have found that they can either be excellent or woeful. The service at Raffles was attentive and we enjoyed the food. You get a three tiered tray of finger sandwiches and pastries as well as a couple of cakes and then there is an lovely buffet with even more choices. It is actually a nice combination that allows you to eat what you like and eat more of what you really like. They had a Christmas theme at this time of year with Christmas desserts on the buffet, which was nice and festive. AND, the staff bought an enormous chocolate Mousse and raspberry cake out as the harpist played happy birthday. The t able next to us also got a cake. I have never blushed so hard in my life. It was just a lovely, thoughtful offering that was included in our set cost!My only criticism was when we asked for sparkling water rather than the champagne that was included in the cost (as we don't drink alcohol), they were going to charge us extra. My husband asked to speak to the manager and they gave us the water as a substitute, which is suitable in a world where 30% of the population don't drink and where good alcohol practices should be encouraged. It should be policy rather than special treatment
1
Went for afternoon Tea, for 2 persons S$115.00 is a rip-off and I estimate that the total cost of the Tea including the Buffet is about S$15.00.The scones where mediocre at best, the Tea, is not individual portions but rather comes from some larger pot which is then filled into a portion Tea pot.Staff was not rude but not friendly either, arrived at 4.45 pm and where promptly informed that the Buffet will close at 5.30, this reminder was mentioned a few more times.The Room was half empty and we liked a table along a wall, which was empty, staff reluctantly reset the table.Overall impression one of the worst afternoon Tea's experienced, there was only one worse which was the Four Season in Geneva
2
The afternoon Tea at the Raffles Hotel, I believe it is in the Tiffin Room.Service is not very good, we came rather late and where promptly reminded by all concerned that the Buffet will be closing at 5.30pm, This Room has certainly a history the service is straight from nowhere. Generally had the feeling that we where disturbing them. There was no warmth and no friendliness. The Tea service is not from an individual pot per person but rather comes from a large Pot which is then poured into a small pot, what kind of tea is this?For 2 persons paid S$115.00, the cost of the tea buffet for 2 persons is approx.S$15.00so someone is making some serious money hereDid not stay at the Hotel, but overall it gave me the feeling that it is a Museum and if I would have been a Guest I would have been part of the exhibits. The Gardens are badly maintaine

We went here for the Indian buffet after visiting the disappointing Long Bar. The food and service were fabulous. I think it was incredibly good value considering the caliber of hotel and the cost of eating in Singapore. We paid about $300 for the two us but that also covered drinks and service charge. The service was fabulous as you would expect when eating in Raffles. They even came around with pashminas for the women in case the air conditioning became too much. The food was out of this world and I definitely think it was worth every penny

Went there for a high tea on the 15 May 2010. The service and the food was horrible. It started with local desserts was labelled wrongly, maybe it is an oversight. However, to my horror, the following dishes were also labelled wrongly. Even after informed the staff, it was not corrected.After which, proceed to get a bowl of porridge, after opening the cover to the lid, discovered that there was lumps of porridge and a slightly burnt lump. I was totally shocked by it. Informed one of the waiteress and after which saw several chief came out with a gentleman with a jacket when to the pot of porridge, instead of bringing the pot into the kitchen, they proceed to scoop out several lumps of the porridge out and afterwhich a chief was there constantly stirring the porridge. I was truly disappointed with all these at such a good hotel

We went here for my 50th birthday celebration meal and had a wonderful meal. So elegant and gracious and I felt so special. We had booked a table for 7.30 and the food was freshly cooked and to me, out of this world! Drinks expensive but free iced water on the table and kept topped up by ever attentive waiting staff. Cost 65 Singapore dollars (about £34) and worth every cent

Curry buffet in the Tiffin Room consists of a range of dishes, albeit we were surprised there was not a better selection. Slightly disappointing that it was being cleared away by 9pm, even though we were still eating – maybe because it was a Sunday? Price reasonable at Sing$65 (£33) each, but drinks extortionate: 750ml San Pellegrino sparkling water S$12; 1 small Tiger beer S$16 (£8!!)

So we had to taste the afternoon buffet at one of the icon hotels of the world. Excitement grew daily.What a disappointment! The buffet was made up of typical Cantonese food.Nothing special.The tea had standard English afternoon tea dishes like cucumber,smoked salmon and egg sandwiches ,scone(minus the cream),custard slices and chocolate puffs.We've had better afternoon tea before....but this is the Raffles.If you want to experience the atmosphere of bygone colonial England,this is the place! I would recommend it for the experience,but not the food
