Had lunch there with my 1yo son who still has to eat his own baby food. And this place allow me to feed him with the baby food I brought. The staff was prompt and friendly. The food was delicious. Nice environment.

The set lunch selection is pretty good and its price isn’t as deep as one may think. The quality of food and its service is also great. With its price and location, I was surprised it’s not busier. I will definitely return whenever I am in the area

Quite a number of set lunch items to choose from. Tempura, beef, Chirashi Don etc. you can have a good variety of choices even if you don’t like raw food. Wanted to try this before but it’s not exactly a cheap lunch, so some people may not accept it as a lunch option. I ordered the Chirashi Don set $24++It came with salad, I liked the crispy fried wonton skin bits on the top, small side dish of seaweed , miso soup , chawanmushi & small chocolate pudding dessert. Generally tasted quite fresh. Quite a variety of fish toppings for the rice bowl. Not bad. Salad was crunchy & pudding dessert was creamy. But I wish the portions were abit bigger. It was an “enough” meal. Not a filling meal. Service was ok. We were there for a late lunch so not many guests for them to look after. I liked the set up atmosphere of the restaurant with the sushi / fish counter design. Would I be back? Probably. Just for lunch though. Alacarte for dinner won’t be cheap.

Our group ordered the set lunch and it was a good choice. At $68,it was good value. We had a nice appetiser set with Sushi, tempura, beef with garlic rice then a dessert set. I enjoyed the beef. It was tender and tasty. The tempura was very nice. The batter was light and crispy. I will come back to this restaurant

Ordered the bara chirashi don for lunch. The different sashimi are all very fresh and tasty. Rice is also grainy and tasty. The chawanmushi and coffee dessert in the set was however not as tasty. The ambience however was very good, lighting was soothing. Overall, lunch was good! Great place not only for dining, but for business purposes as well

Today we decided to try Kuroson in Takashimaya. We both ordered the$68 lunch set and were extremely disappointed! The portions were small, the vegetable tempura was oily and some of the vegetables were hard. The service was awful and very slow. Will certainly not be returning!

Had a business lunch yesterday, ordered a grilled sole fish set and a sashimi set, both were wonderful. There were a few other fresh fish on display in the long counter where we were seated. Business was good and there was quite a few Japanese dining in the restaurant, guess that is a good thing. Service was efficient without being pushy.Will definitely be back to try their dinner.

I never knew that I had to eat my sushi from right to left (served on the dish) until today. Loved the fresh and delicate sushi, hot udon, and crunchy tempura, all for only sgd48 (by Singapore's standards today, this is hugely affordable). Appreciated the attentive staff. The fact that this restaurant is frequented by the Japanese crowds means that it is SO worth coming. I will definitely come again. My man-in-the-house was a tad disappointed with his teriyaki salmon fish, whining that the sauce was too thin for his liking. If you get the Takashimaya tourist privilege, you could get 10% off your bill.

The restaurant has a nice ambience. It has a long corridor with the sushi counter on the left side and dinning tables on the right side. At the end of the corridor are more tables and a few private dinning rooms.Went there to dine with my family. Since there was 6 of us, we ordered a variety of set meals. All set meals came with tofu, salad, chawanmushi and a small dessert. The tofu was excellent and I really like it. The small bow of salad was also great. Chawanmushi - passable. One of us ordered the wagyu beef well done but it same slightly red. Sent it back to recook, no problem. The chicken dish was not good as it was quite tasteless and over cooked. The cod wish was good as well as the other wagyu beef we ordered. The salmon set was average.The service was efficient. The only let down was when we left the place. As we walked out of the long corridor, none of the staff greeted us, smile to us, made eye contact nor say good night or thank us. We felt more like strangers than guests of the restaurant

With a plethora of Japanese restaurants in Singapore, the competition is obviously very very tough. This often makes it hard for a restaurant in this category to stand out even with great cooking.Ginza Kurosan appears to be one of these hidden gems in plain sight. Perhaps being in such a convenient and highly trafficked location has hurt its street cred. On top of flawless cooking and a wide ranging menu of familiar yet authentic traditional dishes, Kurosan manages to be value for money and approachable yet upmarket all at the same time.I highly recommend the unajyu which has to be one of the best in town if not anywhere, including Tokyo. It really is that damn good.

This Japanese restaurant is located at 3rd floor in the near Takashimaya department store. Very good Bara Chirashi set and gindara Teriyaki set. Open till 10pm and not 11pm. Good ambient and good service too.

We tried the restaurant on Sunday night which was not crowded. Sevice was prompt and professional. We had dinner Bento set, Soba with tempura set, warm udon. Also tried the grilled mackerel, squid which was good. The tomago which was highly rated didn't turn out to be sweet enough for us. Generally Ok
4
Elegant dining room. The food quality is high - the sashimi is fresh, and the cooked dishes quite tasty. However, service is random. Some of our dishes came out a full 30 minutes after others. Our neighbours came (and ordered) after us, but one customer got his set lunch before our first dish; poor guy had to wait a long time though, as his companion's set lunch did not come out until 40 minutes later! This is a matter of poor organisation in the kitchen. If you don't mind this kind of stuff, it's pretty good value for the quality

This restaurant has very good Japanese styled ambiance. There are a huge variety of food there to choose from. we like to sit at the counter to watch the chef prepare the food. we tried the sushi which is very fresh and tasty. The grilled beef is tender and juicy. Worth the price . Will go agai
5
Third time here and I wants get a private room for business lunches. Sector is not bad but more importantly the sashimi and salads are very good. Had a grilled fish head and unagi as well which was pretty delicious. The Japanese community in Singapore frequents this establishment and it is heavily recommended.

Not our intention to have dinner at this place but the other restaurant that we wanted to go initially was closed. Passed-by Kuroson which was packed with people during lunch, so we went on googling this place to read the review. Google review showed 4.4 / 5 stars. Your first thought was that this will not be that bad after all. Hence, we make a reservation for the night. Upon arrival, we ordered 2 pax omakase set and order confirmed. 15 mins later, the waitress came and informed that they do not serve omakase today (just wondering why would you not know that you are not serving this upon us ordering in the first place!) Anyway, we proceed with the 2 pax chef assorted sashimi and 2 sets of bento special costs $88 each. When the chef sashimi arrived, to our dismay and disappointment, the sashimi were not that great : 4 out of six of the fish were not fresh, prawn turning black, most of the time texture of the meat was not fresh, the cutting of the sashimi was bad and really difficult to bite of the fish vein in between due to poor skills of cutting the fish.At that point, we were not really enjoying it but still we finished them.Later the bento came and it was just average. I think is abit overpriced for that kind of bento set.We just wanted to complete our meal and leave and do not want to make any fuss about it.As we get the bill and made the payment (mark my word: we made the payment), the waitress reminded us that we stull have a dessert. So, okay fine we will have the dessert. It came and we ate it. But what worse was this, apparently, they forgot to serve another sashimi dish for us which comes with the bento! They asked if we want it but at that point we really want to leave this place so we decline the offer. Yet, they insist and told us that they already cut it! ( so, you cut it and you left it there for sometime and you plan to serve that to us when u realize u forgot about it) Not sure what is worse. Although someone came over and ask why we don't want it and all, nothing was being done to compensate out dissatisfaction. Merely listening and that's it. Really not worth the hype and the money spend here since there are better around Singapore with lesser price. Never gonna come back again.

Fabulous find in Ngee Ann City, the layout it gorgeous. Ask to be seated watching the chefs for the full experience. Beer on tap is a nice finishing touch to beautifully presented meals, that includes vegetarian options. The wait staff are attentive, overall great experience for lunch while shopping

I browsed that this restaurant brings many Japanese ingredients that why I bring my family to try. The lunch set menu was a good deal but what we want isnt on the lunch menu set. We tried the kobe beef set & the kobe beef grill; meat is far from the one I tasted in Kobe, still tender but not juicy & pink. The slices are thin and quite salty with no sauce pairing so you taste real beef but isnt in a very good way. They also have japanese fruits & unusual clamps which I think taste better than the kobe beef
5
This restaurant is not on the 3rd floor, NOT the main food floor of Ngee Ann City. So they probably get very few new walk-in customer yet the place is almost full for a Sunday lunch.Very good ambiance and the food was really exquisite!Aosa Nori Somen 10/10 - the first time I tried a somen (soba) that is so soft and yet Al dente to the bite. The sauc that comes with it is so good that I have to order a second round just to satisfy myself.Tsubodai YK 10/10 - recommended by the captain, this fish takes a long time to prepare as it is BBQ over slow fire. A very fresh fatty fish with lots of very tender juicy meat. I think @ $48 it is better than Kinki, which cost 3 times more.Robata Salmon Belly 9/10 - the salmon belly here is just a different grade. It has a much smoother texture and the salt bake is very well done. Crispy skin and juicy meat.Foie Gras Don Set 9/10 - as a set at $28 and you get Foir Gras, don't expect much but they deliver more than you can expect! Great taste with quite a fair bit of Foie Gras!Prices are reasonable at $52 per pax. Will sure to be back

I went there for my children's term end celebration since they did hard work.The quality of meal we order and atmosphere were very good however we found many odd things which made us disappointed. 1. There were only two staffs working on the floor and they are not able to do their best customer services. Only one male worker seems to know what he was doing but the other lady's are only working to follow manual and not know what to do.2. When we asked "Warm tea" for children instead of "Hot", the lady said "We only have a hot!".3. When finally food arrived, the miso soup cup and tray was so dirty which made stick to my fingers. 4. I made complaints to the male worker but he was only listening while he was paying attention to new customer which made me feel not really happy.5. Most of non reserved customers are automatically sent to the counter and I can see that was making some of them unhappy but none of the main sushi chef and other counter workers did not care to make them happy. Over all, restaurants are run like a factory and did not feel we are really well take care and spending a special time. We left the place as soon as we finished our meals
5
Great Retaurant with an excellent bar. Bar is my favorite place to sit. It is quiet pricy but the quality is just right
4
Posh Ambience but somewhat overpriced for the quality of food served. The range on the menu is impressive but general service is slow.
5
Great arrangement by Mr Jack. Nicely planned menu for us and well taken care by Jack. Tip top and friendly services. The food served course by course with the freshest ingredients and presentation. Strongly recommending this wonderful restaurant.

Excited to see this restaurant in SG. Sashimi salmon sent back to kitchen due to a weird taste. Table next to me sent back their fresh sea urchin n we were total strangers; no conspiration! Service was lax n waitress foreign cannot u understand English well... total food presentation. Taste way below expectations. YET it was quite packed as it was holiday season. For that type of charges, try other better Japanese restaurants in SG

Pity that the service was so horrible (even though the food wasn't half bad) to the extent when I asked for service, the waitress was turning away and just held her hand up at me... 10 minutes later, she hasn't come back. Terribly understaffed. NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT FOR A JAP RESTAURANT especially one with this price range

I sat by the sushi counter and I was served lukewarm green tea, I noticed they also were serving iced green tea, but did not ask me which I preferred. I had to ask what kind of tea it was as it tasted more like water than tea and had a greyish color probably because of the color of the cup. Then I asked if I could have the optional sushi extra with the lunch bento without salmon. It arrived with salmon. The two spoons that came with the lunch set for the cha-wan mushi were both sticky and dirty, I gestured for the waiter to come over but the manager who had been rudely staring at me came over instead. I mentioned the spoons were dirty and he very casually replaced them. It was smoky by the sushi counter as it is an open faced kitchen. It seems their extraction fan is not up to standard. Also some of the food was served on plastic plates. The spoon that came with the bento seemed to be made of plastic as well, not authentic lacquer-ware, which for the price you should expect

Dining with my wife with 2 kids. My wife got into the restaurant before me. When I joined my wife, she was totally unhappy. I asked her to leave seem unhappy but she knew I love Japanese food and she had ordered my favourite food. The big size Japanese manager with dark blue suit ( not sure about his name ) pretending very busy whole noon doing nothing except walking up and down shouting around and scolding staffs. He was the host that day. He asked my wife if do have any reservation. When my wife said no, he said it's full by the way, there were more than 5 empty tables that I could see available from where I sat. Before we sat down, my wife asked how long do we have to wait. He rudely raised his voice and repeating it full and put his hand high above his head with a cross symbol telling my wife there were no more available seat. My wife asked again how long do we have to wait, he said minimum 1 hour and walk off directly. He don't seem interested in doing our business at all. Another kind staff approached us and asked if can offered my wife a seat but it's by the sushi counter corner. My wife take up the seats and wait for me with our kids with her. The food and others staffs are really fantastic and awesome. Really can't believed they have such manager and standing in front the entrance which I would said totally ruin the image of this reputation restaurant. I wish to come back to this restaurant again and again. But I would difinately walk off if I see this big size Japanese manager standing in the entrance again. The food here are really great and awesome. All others staff are so nice as well except this guy. My advice to all members here. Just walk off if u seen this big sized Japanese manager with suit in front the entrance. He difinately will ruin your day talking to him.. Good luc

The selection of sashimi and variety of the menu is very extensive and also boast a very good selection of Sake and Soju. Prices are on the high side.Service wise I would say is a bit lapse where we had a private room but even with the call system which they provided it took them almost more than 15mins to response at times. Overall experience is still good due to the food quality. Service wise can be improve

I've eaten here 3 times - twice a la carte which was excellent, including the heart-stopping starter of foie gras wrapped with kobe beef and topped with uni. However, on the 3rd time we tried the special lunch menu. The flounder was overcooked and quite unappetising. The beef steak was much better and good value. And we got a lovely private room for 10 persons. Yes, I would go again, but will probably stick to the a la carte men
1
Food is good, staff are not. Generally unfriendly with the exception of 2 or 3 of them. Watch out for Mr Shiiro. One of the managers there who is Japanese. He is curt and even hostile/aggressive. Atypical Japanese. When I changed my reservation, he raised his voice "....cannot change...no table....you call next week...". I'm going to the STB as well because to be honest, he is a disgrace to other Japanese people. Don't believe me? Go and see for yourselves

Absolutely love the food here! The kaisendon differs depending on what is in season so it's always a different bowl of surprise when you visit every few months.
The place is spacious and the service crew is attentive (esp a jap lady)!
1
Terrible. Run out of crab, have to wait for 50 minutes. Inefficient for such restaurant. Poor way of going business, time for them to fold up.
4
Best service Ive had from a Japanese restaurant in Singapore. grilled and fresh seafood are the must try. can give fried stuff a miss. will definitely be back!
5
The tastiest cuts of sashimi but that's to be expected at this price point. We sat at the counter and basked in a fresh ocean smell coming from seafood laid before us. Unlike other restaurants, their menu has absolutely no photos of their offerings. The presentation did not disappoint when it arrived.

My girlfriend bought me lunch here. It's on the 3rd floor of Ngee Ann City. We shared the Kobe beef and abalone Teppanyaki set that came with 11 courses including 2 sets of appetisers, fish consomme, Chef salad, grilled vegetables, Kobe beef steak, assorted sashimi, scallop and abalone cooked in butter, red miso soup, garlic fried rice and Japanese chocolate pudding. This set at S$280 is sufficient for 2 ladies. We also had a bottle of Yuzu Umeshu ($70) and sashimi ($40) consisting of 5 pieces of salmon, otoro and akami each. It was a fantastically filling lunch!

Completely in love with their Kinki fish done robatayaki-styled (grilled). Love the counter with the ice and fish all displayed, right in front of the long counter seats and with prices too. Picked the Aburi Sushi (or they call "Seared Sushi" in the menu). Came with an order of salmon, scallop, fatty tuna, fois gras, sea bream & one more I forgot. haha.. Only $30. Good value for the quality and size. Wagyu A5 was a tat lacking in flavour although had great marbling. Otherwise I would have given the place a perfect 10.I could come here anytime! Lunch and Dinner

I lived in Japan for most of my life, my wife is Japanese and we love Japanese food (surprise surprise). Having been in Singapore for 5 years we tried many good Japanese restaurants here. Our vote for the best lunch set goes to Kuroson. We always have the Chirashi-don (raw fish in rice bowl). The fish is extremely fresh and every little dish that comes with the set tastes amazing. It's great value for money for lunch. I haven't been there for dinner, I suspect it is not cheap, but you will definitely get top quality

Never heard of this restaurant till brought there by a friend. Very impressive service. Michael is knowledgeable and polite. Menu is fairly extensive. Food is of a good quality. Price is reasonable. Set lunches are very good value. Tucked away in one corner of the shopping mall. But once in the restaurant it is quiet and relaxing. Windows overlook the street with lots of greenery.Good place for business lunch
3
This is my first time here on the recommendation of a friend.Nice decor. Love the rough (slate?) floor.NoisyMust reserve; fully booked.Tea not hot. For the life of me, I just cannot understand this.Chawanmushi - good - prawn and tender chickenKobe beef with ponzu sauce, steak sauce and salt - Served at room temperature; Unforgivable at S$175 for 100 gm.Somen noodle - goodUdon - goodMixed tempura prawn - goodTuna cheek - don't like thisDried overnight mackerel - okay, not greatAfter we finished everything then the staff offered to change plates. Coke took forever to be served.I totally disagree with hot food or hot drinks that are served at room temperature
5
Never heard of this place before until an aunt introduced it to us. Went over for lunch and was surprised by the set lunch! Quite a big serving for $35++ it could technically feed two people, but greedy me had to eat it alone! And furthermore, added one serving of foie gras wrapped in wagyu beef and topped up with a generous amount of uni ($18). Sad to hear that the dish has been removed from the menu. Definitely recommended to everyone
