The place is quite cramp but the food worth trying. Their Rasa Sayang Laksa a bit on the pricey side but they are not stingy with the ingredients; also worth trying is their cempedak brulee!!

I wasn't disappointed at all paying this reasonably priced Steak "n" Chips if you want quality food you need to be prepared to pay. The steak was cooked and served to perfection the steak comes with a generous amount of chips and salad.I may say that it was really reasonably priced for an excellent meal

No fuss 2 storey restaurant that specialises in Western-style staples. With 5 hungry teenagers, burgers and steaks were the order of the day for us. The meats were juicy and tasty. The side salad was good though conservative in amount. The thick fries filled any space you'd have left in your tummy. Reservations is advisable especially if you intend to go on a weekend. Food was served in no time. Service was basic nonetheless friendly and professional

Chance upon this cafe while cafe hopping! A small cozy place to go to. A fairly good amount of pasta dishes and signature dishes available. Ordered one of their cream pasta, marinara and calamari. Calamari was served with great portion LOVE IT! However the calamari alone was quite bland but it was served with a tomato-based sauce and it compliments the calamari. The portion for cream pasta was good too however the taste is just so-so. Not really that memorable (?) in a sense. Marinara was good.Location wise it is easy to go to as it is nearby a bus stop and the main road. Pricing is okay, average of $25 per paxService was good, staffs are friendly and nice! Overall a decent place to dine a

It was just a small cafe with ordinary decor. I was in a rush to just fill my stomach before my appointment nearby. Ordered pumpkin walnut salad and spicy mariana pasta. To be honest, I did not have high expectation. It came as a very nice surprise. The salad dressing was sweet and just right level of tangy. Warm pumpkin with crunhcy roasted walnut. No other unnecessary ingridents like many other westner eatery. Simple yet delicious.The next come to the leading role, spicy mariana pasta. The sambal chilli is aromatic, tasty and really raise your eyebrows. I kept scooping more chilli paste onto the pasta. Generous fresh seafood included mussels, clams and prawns. Well balance and no overpowering of spiciness. It is additive! you will want more. The only thing i can critise is the pasta may not be good quality and i.e. not smooth enough. It brought down the overall rating of this dish. It is a pity.I did not have space for dessert but they have kula melakah cake and cheese cakes etc. The conclusion is that I will be back to try their other interesting dishes eg. laksa past

I've always enjoyed the pasta at Krave and the cafe atmosphere The have a large menu to offer and most dishes are easy to customise based on your preference. The Rendang Fries was interesting however I was expecting there to be more Rendang Gravy. This would be my third time dining here and strangely, my tongue felt numb whilst eating the pasta this time. I'm not sure if they have put into too much MSG into the sauce. On top of that, my two mussels were not fresh at all - extremely mushy rather than springy texture. May come back if I'm around the area but I think I will stay away from the pasta or any seafood dishes.

Was a little curious about the usual hype on this cafe so decided to try it out.Service was good but disappointing was the food quality.Had Marinara Sambal Pasta and the spaghetti was slightly hard and the sauce tasted salty. The Salmon Au Fromage was the highlight of the order that we had besides the Truffle Fries. But in our opinion, it would be best to serve lesser quantity for the Truffle Fries. Call it a side dish but it has too much quantity with a pricey charge.Other than that, ambience of the cafe was perfect.

The food at this place is to die for! I love the pasta and find it hard to stop myself ordering the same thing each time we go so that I can try other things ... very very hard! Everyone I have brought to this place have raved about the food! It really is a great place for great food and great ambience

My friend is a very well known person in F&B and he recommended us to go for their pastas. Indeed, tried almost all of the pasta dishes and they never fail to make me rub my tummy with satisfaction! Prices are reasonable too!

Great lunch for all of my family. Sweet potato chips were delicious. Very cosy inside but we sat outside with a pram.

This place is fantastic. The staff are super polite and helpful and the fusion menu works extremely well. The quality of the food is super and it is a generally great choice for a meal

my first time and definitely will come back again. no gst & service charge, you pay for what you order only. cosy ambience & good portion.

It's easy to spot the cafe if you're coming from Raffles Hospital as it's along Bali Lane. A cosy place with a nice relaxing atmosphere (especially the second level). While they have the usual Western food (aglio, oglio, carbonara, truffle fries etc), you should try the fusion food instead like cempedak creme brulee, curry pasta, tom yum pasta or asian food like ayam bakar.

Dine here last week. The service is great, friendly and casual. Ambience is fairly good. I prefer the seating outside as theres better view of the shophouses and its breezy. I ordered ayam bakar, burger and cempedak creme brulee. I had a complain on the ayam bakar but they're positive about it and make a good recovery. The burger was awesome! The creme brulee was damnnnn gooood. I will come back to this restaurant again and to the servers: u guys are awesome.

First of all it's halal.. and it's quite near from our hotel 'village bugis hotel'. the restaurant is located at bali lane, next to haji lane. this area is packed with cafes and restaurants. The restaurant itself is a two storey building, not so big but comfy. we ordered pizza, salmon au fromage and cempedak creme brulee. overall the food is so delicious, we love it. but most of all we love the chicken pesto pizza, so goooood. the cempedak creme brulee is unusual yet so tasty, must try.
5
Staff were friendly. Reservation made by email was promptly settled. Ambience was cosy and nice. Food was marvellous. I wish their drumlets were a little more spicy but overall it had a good flavour. You will never go wrong with the Steak and chips. It was well-seasoned and the steak was juicy and cooked to my preference. The best food has got to be the desserts although Im not a sweet tooth person. Chempedak creme brulee was superb and the lava cake was awesome. A must go restaurant. Highly recommended

I was very pleased with all aspects of this small cafe. I ordered the truffle fries (I'm a sucker for anything truffle) and the pumpkin roasted walnut tomato salad. The portions were large and the ingredients were obviously fresh and of quality. You order at the counter and pay before you eat. I love this, so you dont end up waiting around for a check after your meal. My food came in a matter of minutes. I was impressed with the timing considering there wasnt an empty seat in the house!! The atmosphere is peaceful and cozy, and the service is top notch. The desserts and drinks look amazing as well...looks like ill be back soon! Nothing but great things to say about this cafe! Came hungry, left extremely satisfied.

This was my first visit to Krave and I simply love the cozy concept of the eatery. I tried the Kraving Ayam Bakar and shared sides with my friends. The best one was the sweet potato fries which I could not get enough of! Would definitely come back to try out the dessert (T-jah and Mars attack sounds really good). Thumbs up!

Had me some seafood pasta (don't remember the specific name), and it was yummy and spicy (i like it spicy). The price was a bit expensive, SGD 16. My friend ordered the ayam bakar but I find it average.
4
The burgers are decently priced and not too bad on the taste buds. I even got to taste a slice of the pizza and was pleasantly surprised. All in all it was a good experience. Staff were generally helpful although if you sit on the upper deck it's a little hard to get service.

Do not be deceived be the simple interior décor of Krave. I had a lovely experience two months back. I had a lovely time with my students at Krave. The crowd can be quite intimidating due to the space, however, you'll be pleased with the efficient service. I especially enjoyed the food as it caters to local tastebuds-- the chef has creatively elevated basic western flavours to another level: with a playful Malay-fusion twist. In my opinion, the Cempedak Creme Brulee is worth a try! Cempedak is also known as jackfruit and it is one of the more unique fruits which represents Southeast Asia, other than durian, of course! Along with that, the Kraving Ayam Bakar is also one of the better dishes that I have had in local cafes. The dish came presented in a Westernised fashion, but with ingredients of the Malay style of ayam bakar and ketupat, also known as rice cakes. The chicken was tender and just beautiful, coated considerately with an Indonesian sweet sauce. If you're in the mood for western, try the thin crusted pizzas and pastas available. Prices can be quite steep for students, but reasonable for adults! A café worth the visit if you are at the Arab Street/ Bugis vicinity. Hope this review helps! :

This is a value-for money food joint that serves fusion western makan with good taste. We had• Ayam Bakar - which to me is essentially fancy satay on a plate. It has the raw onions (slices), ketupat (cut into smaller pieces and satay sauce spooned over the meat. I found the sauce a tad too sweet and the chicken chunks not as tender as I would like it. Not bad but not a dish I would order again. • Arrabiatta Prawn Pasta - I originally wanted marinara sauce with Chilli padi. The lady at the counter looked at me funny and asked, "So you want Arrabiatta sauce yah?" Heh, I trusted her and yes, it was spicy tomato sauce. I found the pasta a tad TOO al dente but the prawns were large and fresh and beautifully grilled! Very happy with the pasta overall. • Truffle Fries - daughter insisted on having this and the serving is a large serving of hand cut fries with generous mix of truffle bits and slices to give the whole pot of fries adequate taste. • T-Jar - their version of tiramisu. Theirs is not with sponge cake but a denser chocolate cake. The jar is a pretty substantial size and one jar was enough for my family of 3. They have other very tempting mains that I don't have enough stomach space for which I wanna try the next time.

We picked it because we were looking for a place that is not too loud and we can have a good conversation and indeed it is. We ordered marinara seafood, margherita and calamari ring. Good value for money and we really like their calamari ring! We are 3 pax and we only spent $19/pax (including the drinks)

Love Bali lane as this is a quirky little place . Krave looks nothing special and must admit the interior isn't anything special but the food was sooo good. We completely over ordere as we were all so hungry and the menu is so delicious. All the food we ordered were great especially the steak , the pizza and the truffle fries. And we had two birthday girls and ordered two lava cakes with vanilla ice-cream which was one of the best I had in Singapore. So atmosphere is ok but if you like western food this is a great casual place to go

As someone who stays away from fusion food, I must say Krave had me sold with their dishes. I sampled several dishes with my family for our weekend lunch. Their Ayam Bakar and Kurry Kremoso was great. I enjoyed their Gula Melaka drink as well, I’m a sucker for local and traditional flavours. Another must try is their cempedak (jackfruit) crème brûlée. It’s as if French and Asian cuisine tied the knot and lived happily ever after.Krave doesn’t have much space to offer so I wouldn’t recommend the place for an intimate catch up session with old friends. However on other occasions, I do still recommend this place for the variety of flavours it has to offer! Halal food at its best

I never knew about the unknown gems, at least to me, that is found along this lane; one of which is Krave. It does not sit many, but occupies two floors of a converted shophouse. I guess in an attempt to pack in as many tables as the small space can take, the proprietors decided that the only way to do that is to place the tables as close to each other as possible. Reservations are recommended, least you find yourself in a queue outside waiting for a table.The menu is Italian fusion and boasts some interesting-sounding dishes. Tiny chili symbols by the names of the dishes guide you as to how spicy the dishes are. Service is fantastic, the wait staff are chatty yet non-invasive. Orders are placed at the cashier counter on the first floor and the dishes served to you.My friends and I had the run of dishes, from appertisers (the sweet potato fries are quite a delight), mains, desserts (I am partial to the tiramisu, interestingly named T-Jar) and drinks (the smoothies are refreshing). At the end of our meal, I told myself secretly that I will return...with or without friends.

We came about slightly after 6pm on a weekday, no crowd as the kitchen just reopened after a break from 4-6pm. Greeted warmly and assigned to our table. Quite a compact cafe, and i'm here to try out after much recommendations from friends. Was seated directly in the way of the aircon flow, at the big KRAVE logo. Too chilly for me, as the place is still empty, i was just afraid my food will get cold fast with the temperature.Was given a bottle of water and two cups of ice upon sitting down. I flipped through the menu which was on our table, and frantically looking for steak, as that was what's recommended but was disappointed that it's not on any of the page! We almost walked off, until i decided to reach for another set of menu and thank goodness there's that missing page!Quickly ordered as the crowd starts to get in. Me and husband got ourselves the steak, medium and medium rare, and a bowl of chicken caesar salad.Food came quick, we were hungry and ready to gobble down our meals, especially with the delightful presentations ;)Steak was just the way we wanted, kudos to that! Enjoy it throughout, the sauce compliments the meat well and the steak cut fries was enjoyable! Comes with side salad with a slight tangy refreshing dressing.However, the salad was quite bland, the lettuce a bit wilted, not as crunchy. Sauce is creamy, didn't have that punch of taste though. Was given grilled chicken, shredded, but the croutons were disappointing. I expected it to be crunchy, however the texture is like bread. Just cubes of breaded, soft.In all, cost wise we pain $62 for 3 dish plus 2 drinks (canned drinks at $4 each, say whattt)Lucky there's another customer sitting beside us to block the aircon for a bit, that make me have a comfortable meal and conversation with my husband.I will probably come by again, to try out the pasta and desserts
