All served in old colonial surroundings. Aircon restaurant. Not cheap by Singapore standards, expect to pay $60 plus for 2.
Nice pleasant quiet location adjacent to the Malay Heritage Centre.

2-pax ; Sharing portion of Nasi Ambeng (1Pax), Satay Ayam, Mango Salad.
Great atmosphere.
Food was OK but price high side which was not worth the taste nor the value and service.

We went for a group dinner. All the dishes they served had lemon grass, including fish beef chicken. Since I cannot withstand lemongrass flavour, i could not eat anything. Only thing i could have was the soup in the beginning as it did not have lemongrass

Beautiful setting and decor. It's great that it's in a stand alone bungalow within compound of the Malay heritage center. We had two communal dishes, a nasi ambeng and nasi tupeng. In terms of presentations it's pretty impressive.Quality of food was excellent, they explained what was in the platter and was willing to exchange one of the items for something else.... Enjoyed the meal very much. Good service would definitely return again...

Typical Malaysian food - one of the best in Singapore. Next to the Arabian corner/mosque. I went on Friday & all bachelors come together in front of this restaurant, which makes it crowd. Above the restaurant is a school & it's so cute, when all children enter & put their shoes in front of the restaurant, you have to "jump" over them. The food is very tasty & the staff is friendly..

In terms of presentation and quality of food. This is probably the best place to show case the local malay food. Unfortunately for us, they don’t have the choice we wanted, the staff were not able to advise us in advance or give some good introduction. Also, there was a ‘noisy’ group that affected the atmosphere

This is the second time we visited Mamanda, perfect both times. We ordered a sharing plate (which was large) which included spicey prawns, marinated beef, nasi ambeng, a chicken curry among other dishes. All perfectly presented on a large metal/copper plate. The restaurant has several dining rooms ranging from a smaller intimate room to larger airier dining rooms. All comfortably appointed with antique furniture and air con for comfort.Service was good and the server was happy to assist me with details of the dishes I was unfamiliar with. Being from the UK this was most helpful.Will certainly visit Mamanda again on our next visit to S'pore

Fancy a meal tasting exactly like the one you had at your Malay neighbor's house back in the kampong days? This is the place to go! You will be served like royalty in their bronze "Dulang" tray platter. We tried the Nasi Ambeng served in a huge Dulang And we shared it just like how it used to be done when the family feasts. The yellow rice was cooked to perfection and the beef rendang was out of this world. Cooked So Tender! Don't forget the sambal belachan. I could just have that with rice and I will leave happy. Do note that some dishes have to be ordered and prepared in advance. The menu is availability on their Facebook page. We normally call up in advance to check if there are other private functions on going at the same time we plan to visit. We usually avoid times when they are hosting a private event so that we can have a leisurely and private meal in the grounds of a heritage building. If you are in for a chat ask Din The head waiter to share some stories on the history of this place. He makes a great dinner experience awesome!

My longtime Malay neighbor's daughter married to an American Caucasian and they invited us to the couple's solemnization ceremony at this unique restaurant with a strong Malay cultural setting. This is my first time step into this Muslim restaurant which is located just beside the Malay Heritage Centre. Love the awesome Malay cultural setting. The food was spectacular and awesome with a large platter of a wide colorful variety. I gave a thumb-up to the ambience and the sumptuous food. There was also a free parking lot within the front porch of the restaurant relieving of the headache to hunt for parking lot nearby. Fruits and hot drinks were also served to guests on top of some kueh-kueh and I found the waiters' service excellent. Really thanks my neighbors for choosing such a special place for this special occasion. I had a wonderful time enjoying the great food in that spectacular ambience setting. May the couple be blessed with a blissful and happy marriage life

Really enjoyed the experience. We went late 8.15 when most people were leaving. Food could have been warmer. In terms of spice you can have your food as hot as you like. We had Ambeng Platter for two. ($50Sgn). Like a tapas. Lots to taste. The whole area is buzzing with live music and other food opportunities . Will visit this area again.

Terrible service not really interested in the customers, one of the ladies even hit me with a plate in my belly after the dinner. Food was average, restaurant - empty. Non-quality restaurant, do not recommend it.
5
If you want to try the best malay cuisine, just come & enjoy every dish that served in this restaurant.
4
Friendly & good service, the food begs to be eaten - a lot of love went into the preparation the the blend of spices & taste. An unforgettable outing and a must go to showcase of a national treasure.

Came by a while back. Worst restaurant in this area. Restaurant was extremely dusty and dirty with dead insects everywhere and flies still flying around. We ordered a platter and some lemongrass juice but 45 minutes later, none of those arrived. Two other groups of large families came 30 mins later and they received their drinks immediately after ordering.. we got sick and tired of waiting for imaginary food and drinks that would never come and just told them to cancel our order and left. They tried to blame it on an inexperienced server and having an event above but if that's the case, why allow us in then? Restaurant wasn't even 1/4 packed. Would recommend others to avoid
3
Went there for Iftar/birthday dinner. I have dined there a few times when I need a Malay cuisine craving fixed. Food was good but nothing fantastic, atmosphere was relaxing. Restaurant was waaaaay too cold with AC blasting every corner of the wall hence our food got cold really fast. My birthday cake was served while everyone was busy chatting. 4 servers came sang the weakest birthday song ever, half way only as no one was responding to their singing (all busy chatting) it was amusing for me but I rather them not sing at all if it's an obligation
4
Had a great meal with my friends. The restaurant was quite as it was Monday and 6.30pm. No soft drinks like Coke are served he so I had a mango juice thinking it would be fresh but it wasn't.The food was great and as there was 4 of us we got served it in a massive sharing plate.Good variety and definitely full of flavour.Would definitely come back here again

@TheKuoKnowsIt is not that easy to elevate Malay cuisine to haute cuisine standards. But Mamanda has done precisely that.It starts with walking through the front door at the Sultan Gate entrance. There is another entrance at Kandahar Street, which is probably more convenient, but not nearly as impressive.Mind you, a palatial decor is pointless without great food. And Mamanda delights through an a la carte menu that is packed full of tempting Malay dishes.The choices are mind-blowingly varied. So it might be better to opt for the Nasi Ambeng or "a bit of everything on a platter" instead.The dish can easily serve three or four people, though the restaurant says it is should be for two.The Nasi Ambeng can be a good way to sample Malay cuisine at its best. The Beef Rendang is outstanding, the Vegetable with Coconut is superb and the Spicey Prawns provide a real kick.There are lots more on the platter besides. So take your time sampling each element. There is no hurry.The restaurant has a laid-back attitude, which works very well when feasting on fine food in an exquisitely atmospheric restaurant

Gorgeous place, and from what I heard, the food is not too bad.But they double booked my event date by accident, and to think that they would be apologetic about such a mistake... well nope. Insisted on having both events on the same day, made us feel like we were depriving others of having their event when we booked it first with a contract to have the whole venue closed for 6 hours. Did it get better after speaking to them? Nope. We had to constantly call to check on updates when they failed repeatedly to come back to us. They even mentioned that they reserved the right and revenue would be a consideration. When we weren't comfortable with having the event there any longer, they informed us that the deposit would be returned in 3-4 months. Implied that we were not familiar with credit cards or hotel and airline bookings when we said it shouldn't take that long. Well, trust me, this is a watered down version of how I feel at this point. Food may be good but I wouldn't support such an unethical business driven by greed.

How about dining in a 175 year old royal palace? You would not have thought it possible in Singapore. But there it was last week when we brought friends there to lunch.This was the home of the heir apparent to the Sultan whose palace is situated in manicured grounds next to Mamanda. The Palace is now the Malay Heritage Centre.Mamanda has the right ambience of a royal Malay home. The food which arrived in a huge platter for sharing was reminiscent of Muslim communal eating. It was fascinating to see the variety of colors, tastes and ingredients on the platter.Service was quick and the cuisine well-explained. Staff presented themselves well.For those who think Singapore has little to offer by way of history go to Mamanda for a meal and wander around the area. It will give you a new sense of Singapore
5
My first visit to Mamanda on the 14th Feb'17 left me with fond memories of the ambience, great service by the staff and delicious food. Not knowing what to order the staff named Zul was of great help recommending us what's good, the dishes were: Ayam Lemah Cili Padi, Ikan Lemah Panglima, Udang Pepas, Terong Bislari, Sambal Belacan, Nasi Putih Pandan.The dishes were just too good and well prepared by the cook. Zul was a very experienced in his field of work moving around enquiring from the diners about the dishes. This shows that the customer staff relationship has personal touch.Great place with great service coupled with quality staff

Set in the malay hub of Singapore, Mamanda greatly captures the authentic malay food at affordable prices and follow closely to the olden times of Malay heritage and decor.
4
An excellent place for a quiet relaxing lunch or dinner. Prices are reasonable. Food is very authentic. Architecture is historic as the building is an old sultans palace.
2
Very plain Malay offering. Dry restaurant which didn't help. Cheap food competently executed no more than that!!
4
Nasi Ambeng was good and price reasonable too. Less than S$50 per head including drinks. Also cater for events and has special menu on Hari Raya Aidilfitri.
4
The venue itself is good and different from most halal food establishments. I have come here many times when i want to avoid crowded places and bring guests somewhere different. Perhaps cos the price is a bit higher than most halal eateries in that area and yet the service and food quality can be better. The menu range is ok. There are spicy and non spicy dishes. If you choose correctly according to your eastern or western palates the meal can be quite good. There are tables at the terrace overlooking the lawn and the old Sultan's palace. Can have coffee here after the meal indoors. I would come again occasionally.

Our group had lunch at Mamanda Malay restaurant after our Sentosa cable car ride ,tour of Mdm Tussaud & the SEA AQUARIUM. A delightful lunch for 50 people ..served in the style of *Nasi Ambeng*, originally an Indonesian fare but adopted as a localised cuisine.Great flavours , ample variety amidst a traditional malay Royal Court interior finishing.This our 2nd group visit here starting in 2015 . Highly recommended for the experience.Enjoy 
3
The building is worth the hassle and impressive to tell the tale for foreigner friends visiting Singapore. Good quiet dining place for business chats. The food is street food quality. Walking out and going into any malay restaurant around the mosque will produce similar taste or even better and off course at a much lower price. Still will visit again when i need to do some business talk. The parking will comes in hand

Had lunch with colleagues as we're looking for a dinner venue to host our international guests. This was not my first visit to this mansion called Gedung Kuning or Yellow Mansion. Before it was Tepak Sireh Restaurant. From the outside, the mansion look prestige. That's a plus point. However the service does not match the outlook of this mansion. Where is the personal attentiveness from waiters and waitresses when you use the calling button? Gosh! That's a minus point. Next the dishes. We ordered a few dishes to sample. Beef rendang was a mixture of tough and tender, kerabu mangga was good, terung bestari was a bit too sweet and begedil was just normal. However the tahu telur was a great disappointment. I've never seen a tahu telur cooked that way in a Malay/Indonesian style. Now wondering if it's worth bringing our guests here
5
I was invited for a event and had a free Nasi Ambeng dinner sponsored by the organization holding the event there and when I stepped into the restaurant I just went wow. It looked amazing. The mix of old and new was perfect and it made me feel like I was in some special place which didn't exist in Singapore. Foodwise, we had Nasi Ambeng (it's communal eating so come in 4s) and the food was superb. The beef lungs and rending was so yummy and the serundeng (fried coconut pulp) was out of the world. It looks like I will be back again as a paying customer

Mamanda is an elegant Malay restaurant redolent of British Colonial splendor, because it is in the spacious house of the Malay First Minister at the time Sir Stanford Raffles was setting the scene for modern Singapore.It was built at the same time and in similar style to the Sultan's Palace, which is just next door.Mamanda has several dining rooms, including a banqueting room that can seat 12 people. All are richly decorated in period fabrics and furniture, with starched table linen and silver settings.But truth to tell, we were here at 9 o'clock in the morning, too early for lunch, so sat on the terrace and enjoyed two cups of excellent Malaya coffee and pretended we were waiting on an audience with the First Minister
5
Amazing tradition meets flavour explosion which sets your taste buds on fire. The depth of flavour is the enticement not the heat. The heat is there in certain dishes which I particularly love but each dish adds flavour an depth from accompliments. Must do!
5
Had an amazing experience at this restaurant. The place is beautiful with nice decor and great detail. The service was excellent and the food, presentation and taste was exceptional. This place is a must visit!

I went to eat at the Mamanda Restaurant on a field trip there. The restaurant itself was grand and beautiful -- the place was with long tables with fine table cloths and "chair-cloths", like a banquet! It was nicely furnished, with 2 thrones there. However, I didn't really like the food, but mostly because they are Malay stuff and I dislike Malay cuisine, because it is rather spicy. The beef, crackers and some other meat is nice, but they are very hot! The curry, according to my friend as I did not dare try, is nice but if you put too much it would be too hot. Unless you like Malay cuisine, don't go there
3
On first look, the restaurant looks grand and impressive but when food is served, you get disappointed. Food quality no different from Nasi Padang stalls, in fact some Nasi Padang stall food tasted better but the price is 3-4 times more. Certainly not a place for re-visit
3
This newly renovated and refurbished 19th Century yellow coloured building of the last Singapore Bendahara is now being gazetted as part of Istana Kampong Glam Singaporè.Disparingly the food and drinks items served here are not truly great or aurhentic for a royal palace standard.The F&B items sre also overpriced bur serving staff are well trained for a royal court and are courteous and warm. Lacking in desserts and cocktails items are very noticeableThe decor of the restaurant is well coordinated and the restaurant is well kept and maintained but the cutleries are not polushed when served.Getting in and out there is not a problem at all ad it is adjacent to Sultan Mosque.The restaurant caters for small wedding function too
5
This will be my new favorite restaurant to dine every time I am back in Singapore.The restaurant's décor is absolutely gorgeous and the food very very tasty. Very impressed with the flavors. But be warned though, please do not expect good service here. On every table they have installed a "call for service Button" which is weird for a restaurant of this caliber, why on earth would you even consider adopting this technology in your restaurant? Ok granted they have installed the system in this restaurant, even after pushing the button for service it took the waiters more than 5 minutes to attend to you, what purpose does it serve? I see no point of adopting this system. Just invest in good service personnel I would think this restaurant would garner more regulars

Nasi ambeng is a popular dish in the malay culture and it consists of many variety of dishes. From meat to veges. The atmosphere and place is pleasant. Portion wise is good too but the price seems abit too much. $44 for 2 pax is quite pricey
5
This is a nice restaurant, well appointed and decorated. The food is very tasty, it has a home-cooked feeling to it. It's spicy enough, without being overpowering. We had the big plate with 10 different dishes. Definitely worth it. The service was excellent. Green beans dessert was outstanding
5
Mamanda is definitely a place you'd want to visit when in Singapore. The Malay cuisine was outstanding and the amongst the best I've eaten. We were welcomed by the owners and given a brief history of the venue. Best wishes to the owners and staff on Mamanda's expansion plans, I know you will do well

I have been told by my Singaporean friend that in Malaysia, Malay food is defined by the States they come from whereas in Singapore it is traced further back to their origins like Javanese, Bugis, Boyanese, Banjar, etc. Fascinating. Brought here by that same friend who prefers to identify herself as Javanese Singaporean to 'educate' me. We ordered the classic Nasi Ambeng platter for four (though there were three of us only). I've had Nasi Ambeng before but perhaps not on such a 'grand' scale and 'atas' (haute) level. Mamanda is housed in a commendably well-conserved heritage building called Gedung Kuning (Yellow Mansion) right in the heart of pretty Kampong Gelam; the charming Muslim neighborhood dwarfed by the surrounding highrises in downtown Singapore. The juxtaposition is dramatic. The plating is a visually-striking circle of 5 different curries, 2 vegetables, 1 appetizer, 1 salad, 3 condiments arranged on a banana leaf-lined ornate bronze platter. For that beautiful presentation alone, you "up" the price by 30%! A generous mound of fragrant white rice forms the centre of the arrangement. There is definitely plenty of food for four to finish; maybe even five. At SGD49.90 it is a fair deal considering the très elegant setting & the polite genteel service. After all this is a 1st world city. I personally find Singaporean taste-buds rather restrained so the food here felt under-seasoned (low salt) and mild (low heat). Otherwise the food was more than passable with the exception of the pegedil kentang (fried potato patty) which underperformed being stiff and soggy. Our favorite was the fish curry and coconut serunding. Perhaps the only other grievance is that all the dishes served were cold - would have been more appetizing if they were warm. When you upscale what some consider as street or home-style food, the question of worth often arises. Take this with a pinch of salt (pun intended), loosen the purse and have the treat you deserve.

Came here with a native Singaporean and we were not disappointed. This was an expensive meal, but well worth it. Good ambience too. Refreshing to not have booze on the menu!
4
I visited here with a group of work colleagues. Was very impressed. Beautiful restaurant with really nice tableware etc.Menu was extensive with lots of choices. We ordered a set menu which was delicious with really big portions. We also had some vegetarians with us and they produced a good vegetarian option for them.The bill was reasonable and accurate.I liked this restaurant and staff.Highly recommended
4
Had nasi ambeng with large tray of various dishes that we shared 4 of us with total of 12 pax for dinner. Delicious. Thumbs up but a bit overpriced. Nice ambience & classy interior. Friendly staff. Overall was good in historical location in Arab Street. Surrounded with mosque, shops & restaurants.
1
Run down place. Poor decor taste. Claiming to be authentic Malay food but their best-seller is Indonesian cuisine (Nasi Ambeng). Even that, it is not done well. And when did Asians and especially Malays traditionally eat breads? So, no idea what the half-hearted, half-baked bakery is all about apart from selling haphazard cheap nonsense. The dishes overpriced, service is passable. An experience i do not wish to repeat
1
Poor food - the taste and presentation of the main dish we have shared was average. The food including the rice was cold. The menu had limited choices of main dishes. The place needs urgent updating of menu and food. It is a very nice location with great potential. Thanks
1
Most people have said nice things about this restaurant however my experience was poor to say the least. The decor looks tired and I understand it is in a historical building but it needs rejuvenating. The food was probably the worst part. Despite an almost empty restaurant they seated us next to the restrooms - great! The food was served cold and it was uninspiring. We only ate 3 of the items on the share platter. The rest needed to be thrown out - cold bland rice, inedible salads, and cold shrivelled meat which looked like dry leather. I will be going elsewhere for my authentic Malay food next time
4
Dinner walk ins i reckon should be fine as the restaurant was not busy on a saturday night. Service was patient and welcoming enough. Highlight of the whole restaurant wasn't the food but the decor instead. This classy historical gem was beautifully designed with the use of wood, glass and authentic malay display pieces such as the kris. We ordered two platters of the Nasi Ambeng and a few side dishes to go along, the food was slightly above average but then again i felt i was actually paying the above average prices more for the ambiance than anything else. All in all i had an excellent time digging into my rice and side dishes whilst adoring the classy interior. Side note - i believe the flooring on the first floor was the original flooring from the old building which is also has added a nice authentic touch to the facade of the restaurant
4
Parking might be a problem as it's always full. Accessible by own or public transportation,about 15 mins walk from mrt station to this beautiful restored malay 2 story bungalow.Was there last night n the only option was the set as it was ramadan period, they don't serve ala carte dishes.I ordered the white rice nasi ambeng for two that came with a plate of traditional kueh/ cakes. Drinks was separate from the menu.The big plate consisted of many assorted small side dishes to be eaten with the rice in the middle. As I don't know how to eat with my fingers(finger licking good), I ate with cutleries. Actually it's a dish that bonds pple together by eating from the big plate.The food was so fresh! The vegetables n the dried salted sliced fish was crunchy, the beef rendang was melt in your mouth, prawns & chicken was well grilled..portions are good. As for the price, it's a bit pricey but you pay for the good ambience, cool air conditioning and service.
4
We had a lovely lunch at Mamanda recently. It was quiet but to be expected as it is Ramadhan. All the food was very well prepared, cooked and presented. Our four dishes: green mango salad; spiced aubergine; chicken satay; and yellow rice came to just over S$30 - fantastic value! We will certainly go again
5
I was visiting the muslim area of Singapore when I found this restaurant, located in an old colonial style mansion. The service is very nice, accomodating and helpful. I tried a Malaysian menu and it was great, quiet unique (first time for me). The dessert (frozen banana with coconut and chocolate sauce) was delicious, something quiet unexpected in Asian food
3
Beautiful previous home of the Sultan. Our local hosts ordered for us and we really enjoyed our meal. We were introduced to the Nasi Ambeng - including the beef lung! A great experience overall with the work team.
5
We had 12 little dishes served on a huge round plate. Mix of meat, fish and vegetarian Malay dishes. Suitable for the western pallet. No alcohol, just in case you wanted a drunk! But the guava juice is great. Highly recommended
5
The overall environment is really magical, in an historic location, surrounded by a mosque, Cafes, restaurants and shops, you find this Malay Restaurant where food is great and Service is even better.... Worth to visit, and do not miss their Mango Pudding and their Banana Desert, really the best ever. Highly recommended
5
This is a former palace now restaurant. The staff were wonderful and catered to our every need. The food was absolutely delicious. We had a large tray of various dishes that we shared. The Server explained each one in detail. Some things were unusual to our palates but tasted delicious nevertheless. We would definitely go again when we're in that part of the world
4
Mamanda restaurant is located beside the iconic Sultan Gate. The restaurant have provide great dining experience. One of the popular dish is the Nasi Ambeng. The Nasi Ambeng are served in a traditional large circular tray. Serving are for 2 or 4 paxs. Worth the price you pay.
4
We took some friends there on a Saturday evening. The tables in the Aircon rooms were all taken but we were accommodated on the terrace of this colonial bungalow built by he British for the Sultan'a chief minister. Al fresco is pleasant later in the evening when there is a breeze. The chair backing the garden is somewhat precarious so there was a hairy moment when our guest tumbled to the ground. Fortunately she was young and the grass was soft. The service was a trifle slow as the restaurant was well patronised. However, it has an old world charm and is friendly. It would probably be better though to get drinks and nibbles started first and then allow guests to choose their menu in a leisurely fashion. The speciality of ther house is the communal trays. Huge platters with a central mountain of rice and a variety of Malay dishes. The menu prices are frighteningly scary from $49 pax. If you were to check though you would find it is the price per tray which serves 4 easily. We ordered a la carte which worked out at $22 per person without dessert which is more than the the most luxurious tray for four would have been. The food was well worth waiting for. It was not necessarily as fine as Royalty may have served but it was tasty and better presented than the rest of the Malay establishments nearby. The rendang or dry beef curry was fragrant with coconut and lemongrass. We enjoyed the satay and the kerabu salad. The kerabu was a finely shredded mango salad not too spicy for my Malaysian husband and Sri Lankan friends but I was tongue tingly numbed for a while. The chicken Percik was nicely grilled after having been basted in peanut sauce. We also enjoyed the eggplants with Sambal: nicely spiced with a little kick but not too much to keel over. We were replete after rice and six dishes and thus had no dessert. I have since been back and tried their Malay kuehs known as cuci mulut or palate cleansers. These are tiny and someone has taken the trouble and has the skill to mould them as flowers. The kueh sarlat has a glutinous rice base and a coconut custard topping and is presented as a daisy. It is of a good quality. That is the coconut custard tastes as it ought and not of custard powder. The kueh talam is also superior to most shop bought tasting of Palm sugar and coconut jelly not merely being stodgy. They have started a bakery in the front of the shop. Their Danish pasties are ordinary despite looking pretty. What is worth taking home is the bread loaves with a Malay touch. The rendang loaf is superb. An unusual offering is the Sambal petai ( stink bean) loaf. It is an acquired taste but perhaps fairly easy to acquire. The load is spicy but has a bitterness that is not an unpleasant counterfoil. Mamanda offered an enjoyable evening out at a reasonable price. I can live with the slower service pace since I get to enjoy pleasant historic ( for Singapore) surroundings.

A very good friend invited us to dinner at Memanda. To our surprise, he told us that he was born in this very building and spent his childhood here! It was his family home until it got compulsorily acquired by the government as a historical building, called Gedung Kuning, which was a part of the Malay royal grounds. We had the pleasure of dining in the private room, which he told us was their formal dining room before.We shared the Nasi Ambeng platter, full of different Malay dishes. It was a delicious mix of flavors and textures. Our host told us it was a celebratory dish for families and friends to come together to share. It was a good dinner, especially coupled with the stories of the building's history and its fine architectural details (sorry, unfortunately, this experience cannot be repeated for others in this respect unless you get to know of this friend).The service staff was friendly and attentive. Quite modern in some respect, as their menu comes on a tablet. The venue is available for events and weddings, and they have a small shop selling crafts and snacks at the back
5
Had the Nasi Ambeng, a platter full of Malay dishes including samba udang, beef rendang, sambal goreng, serunding, and of course, sambal belacan. Some may say that the offerings is not true to the "real" nasi ambeng. To these critics, I'd say that the one offered here at Mamanda is so much more. The variety on that one platter is like a tasting menu and an introduction to authentic Malay food for diners not familiar with the cuisine. Each one of those dishes was excellent! Shared it with 3 others and everyone had their fill, and truly enjoyed the meal. Considering the number of people that shared the platter, the price was just right...much more affordable than the tasting menus charged by other high-end establishments. The ambience of the building and the dining area is very conducive for formal and informal meals - not too uptight, nor too lackadaisical. Service was commendable, with the dining staff every ready to respond to our requests. I'd come back to Mamanda at any time
5
... is how it feels when you come to Mamanda! What a beautiful setting in a former palace, with all the ambiance and elegance you'd expect in such an architectural gem. I hosted a group of 10, plus myself, and I trusted my Singaporean, Indonesian, Malay, and Bruneian friends to do all the ordering. I think we had half the menu on the table, and everything was wonderful! There was a coconut curry, light yellow in color, that was TO DIE FOR; plus ikan kering, some kind of stretched-out, dried, and heavily salted little fish (Westerners: if you like what we call anchovies, you'll like these); a mixed veggie dish with green beans BARELY cooked, and just full of the freshest flavor, and lots of things the names of which I can't remember, sorry to say. But I do know this -- there wasn't ONE thing I wouldn't order again! This dinner capped off a 2-1/2-month stay with my friends, and this was the perfect place to bring them to thank them all. The service was good, the food EXCELLENT, the atmosphere from another time. I'll definitely be back

Happen my first time visit this place by friend recommend.If you never notice,you may have thought you enter some one home.Once enter the building you notice there's a room on the left, for diners with few tables.Service was good,maybe not crowded that day(weekday))Food,I may say average.What good,rendang (beef) and honey chicken (is spicy type)..soup of the day,depend that day,my taste is chicken soup...very strong spices taste.Tofu goreng,if fried will be better.Mango salad..more like Thai style.Conclusion,they should have food more to muslim varieties.What I like of this place is atmosphere and quietness.Parking is free inside and outside (public car park),after 5pm is free
