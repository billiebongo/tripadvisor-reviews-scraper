Excellent variety of meals and prices are reasonable. Gets very busy during the lunch hour. Vendors are pleasant

Good music, drinks and nice view on the street. Perfect for a bucket with friends before partying. Location is central, walking distance from other bars. Convenient and reasonably priced

Nice bar, with a fantastic variety of (imported) craft beers. The food available is a step above the usual bar fare. Even the complimentary snacks provided with beer are comparable to 5-star hotel quality, rather than the simple nuts you get in most places.

We went here on the eve of my birthday so it was almost 11pm already, they were about to close but luckily we were still being accommodated. We ordered Arugula pasta which is a little too spicy (for us, we thought) and buffalo wings, best ever!! When the waitress also learned that it was my birthday, she greeted me perkily (even though I knew she's already tired). Good food and very nice ambiance
