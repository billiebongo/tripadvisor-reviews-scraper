Classy fusion Restaurant at affordable price , loved the abalone truffle rice ! Do go for the buffet menu as the serving is great, esp for group outing!
4
Nice and cosy ambience. Location of restaurant is near to mrt.
Food is tasty and at reasonable price. Service is good. Will recommend to friends.
5
This is my 3rd visit to KUVO. Great value for money with good quality food. Staff are friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back again!
4
A repeated visit. Quality of food still as before. Great for gathering as not too crowded and serving time is great in between dishes.
4
Thanks for the friendly staff, my friend enjoyed the mini bridal shower as well as the food. It's fusion dishes.
5
food was great & portion was just right. will definitely be back and recommend Kuvo to my family & friends!
4
It‚Äôs a good dinning place for gathering and discussion meals. Very quite and classic. Great place to chill too with very affordable price

Kudos for them for surviving that long, without much changes to their menu esp now is in the 2018They focused on doing what they are good at, I believe soThe dinner items will include a plate of suckling pig and crab(if u r 4 pax or more)-but pay a bit more for dinner For the order-once item: the abalone (is good) though the broth rice somehow is an acquired tasteA quiet place for dining tooI should asked to serve the fried rice or noodles first the fish maw soup is not bad, its beef & the pork ribs are tenderlicious! the dessert like Calamansi jelly and the panfriend glutinous rice ball is not a bad attempt just that it is too full towards the end, kids would love the deepfried enoki mushroomDefinitely good for big eaters and for diners who would not mind such a variet
4
they have so much good tasting dishes for selection. And I think the only way to taste all of them (without wasting) is to get your friends to come along! the "perfect" number is 4 persons. that way you will be able to try their chili crab. It is not 5 stars for me because they dont serve chili crab for party of 3. :(
4
My first visit to celebrate a birthday. Ambience. Food. Service. All elements to make it a cosy and warm experience for the group! Price was value for money considering its located and wholesome experience. Only suggestion is for the choice of food on the ala carte dinner list to be extended! :
5
great ambience, over enthusiatic service staffs, centrally located in orchard road, great variety of food and wine options!
5
Revisited the restaurant with my another group of friends, as usual the food was great & üëçüëç service.
4
Kitchen took a bit long to prepare the food. The waitress inform us that the chef's first attempt to cook the fish wasn't good, so he's re-doing it. Meanwhile, she served us some bread. Service compensated for the wait.
5
nice food and waitress are friendly.value for money.Recommended by my friend,I think definitely we will visit again.
4
Chill ambience with friendly staff. Affordable cocktail prices. Relatively undiscovered hideout, so great if you need a break from the orchard crowd.
5
I was shopping and stopped for a drink. In the end I ended up having a great dinner with my friends.After dinner we moved to the bar side where Vlad too great care of us. Had my best Manhattan ever with his special vermout. Highly recommended
5
Visited on a quiet thursday night with a few girlfriends and we had a great time. Staff were very attentive, service was quick and they explained things, and met requests very quickly. Thumbs up for that!The food overall was very good! Almost all the dishes were great with a few needed more seasoning but otherwise the quality was very consistently good with some stand outs.My favorites were the suckling pig with prawn paste, the egg soup, abalone truffle rice, fried enoki mushrooms, calamansi jelly and grilled squid. The chilli clams, steamed mussels, chilli crab, spinach, prawn balls were all nice too.The fried rice and carrot cake however were bland and needed more seasoning. Whereas the black pepper sauce for the beef was strangely acidic although the beef was very tender and delicious!If you are coming for the ala carte buffet I'd definitely recommend coming with at least 3 people or more so that you will be able to enjoy the variety more people can order and share
4
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that it was just going to be an ala carte buffet, was initially disappointed but when the first few dishes were served... All disappointment was thrown out and forgotten! Food was very yummy, except maybe the fish could have been less dry, and the spicy lava prawn roll less watery and less spicy ... service was excellent and I managed to try an amazing Suntory red wine there :
3
We had alot on confusion on the ordering system, we wanted to try a portion of certain items for the first round before we decided which to order more of, but 6 portions came because according to them, for the first round, everyone gets one portion. Subsequent rounds, we order 1 or 2 portions but same amount of food came, so we got confused by that. Food wise, we enjoyed Grandma's fried rice, the beef cubes and the fish maw soup. However it would be nicer if everything was served hot. The only thing that was served hot was the green tea. Service can be improved, we had to remind them a few times with regards to our orders. Nice atmosphere though
3
Was there with a group of girlfriends for the buffet dinner where there was only one serving for the premium dishes eg mussels, suckling pig with prawn paste, abalone with truffled rice etc while the rest were free flow ala carte buffet. Do note that this is a Chinese tapas food, that means small servings. That was fine as the food was delish however it took them like forever to serve! We waited v Long between the dishes and at one point we even had to hurry them. It was a crowded night so they couldn't deliver up to speed, this definitely needs improvement as it affected the entire night enjoyment. Luckily the food compensated for it. My Favourite were the fish maw soup, wanton, beef cube (thou a tad too salty), the calamansi jelly better if less sweet and lastly the glutinous pancake
5
There are service are very good. The waitress and waiter are friendly and helpful. The atmosphere over there are very relaxing with a nice music too.
5
Awesome food as usual at place we frequent. Thecseafood pot is now available upon request but it's great as usual. Can't wait to be back for the ala carte chinese buffet!
4
Enjoyed our relatively cosy dinner with the unique dishes. A slightly wider variety would be good, e.g. more dessert choices.
3
Food was good but service was extremely slow, had to ask the waiters to rush the food several times. Some of the food we ordered did not come at all and there were no updates by them
5
Went for lunch on a Sunday noon and it was not crowded at all. Food was good and the set was really value for money. Service was excellent and attentive, probably because there were not many customers.
5
Nice ambience and reasonably priced menu. Staffs are very attentive and great services. Will definitely visit again =)
4
Enjoyed the food. Lovely ambience. Will definitely go there again! Love the small plates menu. Good for any occasions
4
Beautifully cooked duck classique, but on the small side. Lovely interior with great service. Couldn't be a better location
3
Kuvo is located at the second floor of Orchard Shopping Centre. The dining in area is quite huge, with one end the Elixir Bar for its cocktails and the other end the Vine Lounge for its huge collection of wines. My visit was on a weekday night, and the place was relatively empty and quiet. Overall the food is not bad. The waiters and staff was fantastic, they presented flawless service, friendly and professional. The attentiveness and enthusiasm of the service made for an enjoyable, evening. Great place for a sit down dinner with its cozy lighting and nice food
3
It is a great idea that unfortunately did not take off. Kuvo is located at the busiest crossing along Orchard Road. It started as a multi concept space but I was told on the day I was there that the band performance had been scrapped. The food is good and service friendly, so hopefully it would get more attention
5
The place was really cosy and the ambience was great! The food did not disappoint either! :) Loved my rice bowl!
4
Enjoyable dinner with friends. We had a few small plates. The steak bites and wagyu scotch eggs were excellent! Caesar salad and calamari were somewhat disappointing.
Service was a tad slow, but the ambience was pleasant.
5
Having my hubby birthday lunch worth family . Truly enjoy the foods and the attentive of 2 staffs that serves our table of 8 . Make a memorable birthday lunch with complimentary slice of cake too . Will come back for more ..
4
Staff were friendly and service was good but drinks took abit too long to serve which is rather unacceptable. Even ice water has to be asked twice...
5
The service was really good and the food was value-for-money. The seafood pot socialite was the best.
4
Good service and food. Great place to bring your partner or family. Do check out their promotiom on facebook as you could get a bottle of wine for free for certain seafood promo dish.
4
Had a business drink over at Kuvo one evening and realised what I have been missing out on all this while. An award-winning mixologist who believes in taste, balance and the harmony of bringing the different elements together. They offer well presented, small tapas-sized dishes which are big on taste and complement the cocktails served.Overall it is a nice chill out place if you are not looking for loud music but just a serene evening of catching up with your other half and friends
5
went there for Christmas lunch. the place has nice ambience. If you like dining with privacy and particular with staff good service, this is definitely a place to recommend. The food is really good and you can eat at your own pace. The service provided by the staff here is exceptional and very attentive. This is a hidden gem along Orchard road
5
I came here with my family, including a baby of 6 months. The space was large enough for all of us, and the staff were very accommodating to our needs i.e. requesting for a bowl of hot water for the baby, etc. The only thing for families with young ones who come here is that there is no nappy room. As for the food, it was excellent as always and we thoroughly enjoyed it.
5
Nice food and beautiful ambience. They have a wide variety of wines and are always on the lookout for more food options as well as an extensive wine list. Most of the staff are attentive and service oriented and the drinks are concocted very nicely. Some food that are among my favourite are the truffle fries, prawn mee and crayfish laksa. Yummy !A cosy and romantic place to bring close friends and your loved ones to chill and unwind
5
Really fresh seafood in a pot we were stuffed happy by the end of the dinner. What's more we had a bottle of white wine for free! Can't ask for more.
5
Was probably 1 of the most memorable experiences i have ever had with my wife. Was wven suprised with an anniversary dessert by the amazing staff at KUVO. Truly magical evening.
2
Good service and friendly staff. No atmosphere for dinner. However , should be good for lunch and friend gathering.
3
Bar food was mediocre. Cocktail drinks were decent. Nothe much to shout about. Good for decent chill out place with decent crowd in Orchard
4
The dim lighting and the quiet place - not too crowded make it a good place for couple or a group for gathering where they could sit down and enjoy the food. The waitress are also attentive.
3
Overall is quite alright , environment not bad, quite comfortable and quiet... enjoy chatting with friends.. I think more cust at night for alcohol ... food was not so excellent,
4
Service staff are attentive and were able to give good suggestions on the selection of food. There restaurant was pretty quiet, hopefully it can attract more crowd in the near future. Recommend for business meeting too. The open pantry is a nice concept. Wish that the restaurant can make full use of it during dinner time to do some live cooking

After a weekend of a fair few cocktails throughout Singapore, including the infamous but average singapore sling at raffles, Kuvo-Elixir-Bar really ramped up the quality and far outweighed any other cocktail we'd had all weekend. The flavours were simply devine, with our winning cocktail being the whiskey, red wine, egg and orange. Sounds horrible I know but it was so velvety and delicious, a must-try for anyone visiting!Unfortunately I can't comment on the restaurant or give this place a fair review. We visited here an hour before closing time on the Sunday evening, the restaurant was closed but looked really lovely. The atmosphere was to be expected, more than a little quiet despite a couple of very small groups in the bar. The service was nothing special, but then I think being so late in the day the staff just wanted everyone out and to head home! But still you wouldn't quite expect this from a bar serving such outstanding drinks. Therefore huge kudos goes to the barman alone. They also have a really fun concept where you can choose to 'build your own cocktail', should you be feeling experimental. The atmosphere was incredibly chilled out with some really great classical music setting the scene and making you feel as though you stepped in to some kind of alternate universe in conjunction with the madness of further down orchard road. I would encourage everyone to seek out this hidden and slightly inconspicuous upstairs bar and taste the various delights for yourself
5
Definitely for Lifestyle clientele. A good spread of food- infact too much. Perhaps the weekend spread could be reduced for a slightly lower price? But definitely a good place for a leisurely afternoon tea on a Saturday afternoon without the noise of other hi-tea restaurants or cafes.
4
Where does one find a decent place to be for lunch or dinner or drinks? Kuvo offers decent lunch sets, killer snow crab chahan and a decent laksa.... Moreover, the Japanese mixologist creates delightful cocktails! In addition, a talented duo sings on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturday nights... More than one reason to visit Kuvo again
4
Very good environment for having lunch . Nice food n coffee. Attentive staff . Good discount , will come for it if they have a good promotion
5
Friendly bartenders and staff, the food is really good too!! Really love the live band and the music that day!
4
Centrally located. Good food, good service & nice ambience. Value for money. Great for business, friends gathering
5
A wonderful experience, staff service was excellent! Food was perfect, nice ambience in a superb location.
3
Food was good, very slow because they were under staffed and it felt like kitchen was not an efficient system but service good. Gave free food. Worth it only with 35% off
5
Had dinner at Kuvo during Singapore Restaurant Week in March and were very happy with the experience, the food, and the service. The ambiance of the Restaurant is much better than the outside of the building and the dated escalator to the 2nd floor would suggest. The dinning room is very cozy yet modern, and offering a good sense of privacy. Food was impeccable, Especially the Warm Summer Berry Almond Cake was out of this world. We only managed to get a late reservation as seats for the restaurant week tasting menu are limited. The restaurant was actually less than half full when we arrive and gradually stated to empty out even more. The staff remained very attentive and was not at all inclined to make us leave fast. Kudos for that! An excellent Restaurant, very likely to return - certainly during the next Restaurant Wee
3
I came back for the bread pudding but didn't manage to order that this round cuz we're all too full. Ordered cocktails, wine and coffee but our drinks are staggered every 5-10 minutes. It's almost half an hour into ordering by the time the last person got his drink even though we all ordered at the same time! Will still come back for the bread pudding, drinks and live band performance but maybe not on a Fri night
4
We were celebrating our 4th anniversary tgt and wanted to look for a place with nice food that was quiet and wouldn't really hurt the pocket, gotta say, we found the right place! Went there for dinner and left stuffed!! Dishes we ordered; small plates: grilled octopus, beef scotch egg, portobello mushrooms with asparagus, the iberico grilled pork.mains we shared the king prawn linguine. My gf also had half a dozen oysters. I gotta say the pork and scotch egg is a must order! For desserts, if you wanna go all out, get the bread pudding and the hazelnut puff! You won't regret it!! The vibe of the place was really nice, peaceful and pretty! The service stuff we're all super nice
5
I cannot gush enough about this place. The food is excellent, especially the beef cubes and chicken wings (both coffee hot wings and belacan). Huge selection of fine wines and cocktails. Sit at the bar counter before or after your meal and enjoy bespoke cocktails and a nice chat with the bartenders (Al and Yutaka). Service was fantastic. I have been here several times the last week and every experience was perfect
4
The food was really very good with the taste, nice display too and service by the manager and other staff but was served by an "over enthustatic" server who made the whole group really uncomfortable. Also, the "no byo cake" policy is so inflexible though we were compensated by a free dessert and again a taste of the "over enthusiastic" server. The food was really nice, but the service was too haunting for us. A few examples of the service were even before I sat down, if you have difficulties finding my name on the reservation list, I can help myself but she was asking "do you have another name?, you put another name is it?, the server grabbing my friends bag while seating down, and asking me "do you understand what I said" like a parent scolding her kid, "you can blow the cake but you cannot eat the cake here, but if you inform us in advanced it will be different, when we blew the cake, she said a very loud "make a wish", we are adults and we do not really need people to cue when we need to make a wish. And she's "nice to join" in our conversation and even stood there asking my friend for the answer and say she's curious to know. So I hope the restaurant do a proper selection/training of the staff. As this experience is too haunting for us to go back again. It might be for the other customers too and it's a waste that the food is so nice but spoilt by the service
5
Very warm service staff, yummy and well-preserved food and relaxing setting with tables spaced nicely apart for good conversations to take place
4
The foods is good, except the so call coffee wings was just over rated. Was too dry and not so meaty . The desserts was fantastic
4
Atmosphere was great and service was warmth.
Food portion is just sufficient for individual.
Love the different type of cheese cakes and bread pudding! It was soooo delicious!!!
Will definitely return for dining!!
3
Food was good but not exceptional. Staff was very attentive and courteous. A bit pricey for the location. Not too many people were dining at the time we were there and we stayed for quite a bit.
2
Feeling a little peckish at lunch time went into this restaurant and entered a well laid out and pleasant looking dining area. Staff were polite but seemed to lose interest when we only ordered the free range country chicken with Kumara mash and a jus of forest mushroom and an English tuna scotch egg with melted Edam cheese and a red wine onion jus and an orange and apple juice.The wait was a too long (nearly 20 minutes), although the food was tasty. perhaps the cost of nearly ¬£30 was perhaps a little bit too rich
4
We made reservation for birthday celebration. The portion were just adequate (we weren't big eaters to begin with). We had the caesar salad, ribeye steak and wagyu beef cube followed by chocolate strudel and crispy crossiant pudding. Sweet romance tea and Auchentoshan whiskey to top it off
5
OUTSTANDING New Tasting Menu !I was here the previous Sunday and was impressed enough to return this Sunday.This visit, I was tempted by their NEW Tasting Menu.Menu started well with the Foie Gras Terrine.Next came a rather bland chewy scallop in Champagne foam.Following this, there were THREE OUTSTANDING COURSESThe Atlantic Cod, seasoned and cooked to perfection "I was levitating in delight",And then followed The Angus Beef Tenderloin, a beautifully seared, full flavoured, melt in mouth texture with an exquisitely balanced mushroom and peppercorn sauce that respectfully did not overpower the tenderloin.Both the Cod and Tenderloin bear testament to the cooking skills of this establishment. APPLAUSE !!!I am not a desert person, and so I will describe The Rum Cocoa Mousse Bar as DECADENT. It packs a full punch of flavour.I had the Hot Yuzu Tea which I enjoyed tremendously.Service was EXCELLENT. At $79++ for such a good quality dinner, I feel honoured to have dined here.I am going to return soon
4
I was looking for a live band outlet with dining near Paragon Orchard.Chope Concierge recommended KUVO.I arrived early at 5:30pm for my first ever visit last Sunday (6pm reservation).Ambrosia Restaurant had a private function going on, so I was sat in the Bar LoungeI ordered A la carte from their Small Plate Menu.There a good variety of dishes on offer.The menu itself is an interesting readThe Slipper Lobster Laksa LemakAssam style, "nothing WOW", the lobster meat lacking firmness. Wagyu and Camembert SlidersMy FAVOURITE !The 2 sliders look PLUMP calling out to be eaten !!Firmly delicious, quite a mouthful.The 2 shrimp wontons were crispy fried adding texture and overshadowing the 2 cheese rollsBrandy Flamb√©ed Beef CubesSucculent cubes of beef with pieces of whole garlics served on a square metal dish.The beef cubes were shimmering in the glazed red wine sauce.Flavour was 2-dimensional, several cubes were chewy with gristles.(I had tenderloin cubes with blue cheese dip elsewhere, that was sensational)Service here was friendly enough.I will return to savour their other dishes soon
4
Just went to this place, It is nice place .Weekend afternoon tea is great .Just had a pot of tea, and 3 tier of snacks and additional buffet spread of soup, and hot dishes like beef cube, chicken, and salads, cheese, and wide variety of cakes, and pastries.It is good place to relax and have tea.Weekday afternoon tea don't have buffet ($28 per pax)Weekend afternoon tea with semi buffet ($42 per pax.
4
I was quite sceptical about the restaurant's location but everything changed when I stepped into the restaurant. The ambience is nice, and the view overlooking Orchard Road gives you a surreal dining experience. The buffet spread was good although choices were limited. I guess you got to come here with a 'Quality over quantity' mindset. Overall I won't mind coming back again for the buffet spread
2
Wanted to try this restaurant based on the good reviews I read online. Unfortunately the food was very average and we had to send a dish back. Not recommended
3
Taste was average, prices were too steep for the portion served. You have to pay extra to have mains for dinner.
4
Nice food, good service and nice ambience worth going again.. The price might be a bit steep. But still worth it.
4
Tried this restaurant both during lunch and dinner, and prefer the ambiance in the evening. Curated wine selection. Delectable tapas. Attentive waitstaff.
5
This place is a rare gem in the heart of Orchard Road.
Went there a couple of time and their staff are very friendly and helpful.
5
Recommended this by a friend and after checking the reviews on trip advisor went along. It's tucked away but clearly signposted. The sliders were sensational as was the burger. The pork belly was fantastic too. Desserts of passion fruit surprise and chocolate strudel was a brilliant finish. Really well done. Staff were top draw, quiet, respectful and knew when to leave us alone. Rare skill but that's what you expect for a spot like this. Would happily come back and work my way through the menu time and time again.
5
It's Restaurant Week and we had their set dinner for $38++. We started with King Prawn on Crab Timbale. The prawn was nicely grilled till you get their BBQ taste on the outside. Chunky fresh prawn with head on...very nice. The Crab Timbale's name had me clueless but I googled it and realised that timbale means pan and that's exactly what it was. Delicious crab meat with mayo and cucumber bits served in a round shape. The crab was light but flavourful. Simply delightful!I chose the Char-Grilled Angus Ribeye which was two slabs of beef that is well seared. very very tasty beef and the sides of potato, carrots, vegetables and mushrooms were also very good. They each held their own flavours yet complement each other so well! Super satisfied!Dessert was Almond Cake with fruits on the side. It's a very generous almond cake serving and it was so fragrant! Very delicious cake and they paired it with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream which was so nice that I wished it were a much bigger scoop!Serving size in general was also very adequate, not like french food where it's a big plate and small amounts of food. I am SO coming back for their amazing food. Every dish was so so good! Amazing!
4
Located a level above the busy streets of Orchard Road, you can find this quiet and pretty good restaurant next to Somerset 313.The food looks good and taste good. We liked the beef cubes best during our visit. Desserts was not on par with the food we had. Ambient is really cosy, and not too cosy amidst the December shoppers. Staff were very friendly and gave us good recommendations for the cocktails. I would recommend this place for drinks and chats because of the cosy ambience
4
Pretty convenient location to get to if a little difficult to spot. Offers much respite from the hustle and bustle of orchard road, with a pleasant view of the street from the 2nd floor it's located on. Broken into 3 sections it's worth exploring the lounge for a wide choice of drinks and tapas; the giftshop for takeaway treats and finally the main dining area for some pretty decent food. I've been here numerous times for their set lunch which is really where the value is at. At ~$22++ for a 2 course meal or $32++ with the addition of a dessert, Kuvo offers some fantastic value around orchard road for a great quiet lunch.Food wise, the appetisers and mains are nothing to really scream about. For that price you're not gonna come out disappointed but it's not the best and it never achieved to be either. What did strike me however was the quality of their desserts, specifically their bread pudding. Priced at $16++ ala carte its not the cheapest dish around but just digging into that crisp layer of crust and hitting that steaming core of pudding was marvelous. Paired with vanilla ice cream and salted caramel it makes for the perfect, if heavy, end to any meal. Or the start of one in my case. The other choices of desserts can easily hold their own too just be sure you've got an appetite for some heavy sugary goodness.Overall, I'd say Kuvo easily achieves what it set out to be. A nice convenient location along orchard road offering a vast variety of dishes from local to international, fantastic desserts, an impressive selection of alcohol and a level of ambience impossible to find along orchard road at this price. If you've got 30 bucks to spare for a lunch along orchard road, Kuvo is definitely worth a bite
5
There was a private event at the restaurant area so we dined at the lounge area. Ambience was great. I like that the food portions came in small plates so we could enjoy a variety. The cocktails were amazing. I tried the bespoke cocktail and the mixologist did an excellent job! There was live music as well when we were there on a Saturday. A create place to chill with friends
5
KUVO has impressed me with their good food & service. Tried their slipper lobster laksa & duck confit- fantastic!
3
Thought TCC member will get 15% discount, but it was not meant to be, hopefully next round it is valid
1
good food but quite expensive
too much staff who is in the way the whole time: during dinner they take plates away ; you can only clean the table after everybody finishes their dinner!! really ennoying.
5
First visit there for high tea with friends. Very nice ambience and great food. Had pan cakes, calamari, hot wings, gelato, cakes & Yuzu tea. Will definitely go back again
4
The place is not crowded, great place to meet up with friends. Service staff are excellent. Not too much of variety for the tea buffet, but the peranakan dishes are pretty awesome.
5
Food was fantastic quality and reasonably price but best of all was the service. I was having a bad day having lost my luggage at the airport but the staff soon cheered me up :)
4
We wanted to try this place cos it has some creative fusion food. True enough the food quality was excellent and tasty. But a month ago, they changed their menu and almost all their food came in small plates. So be careful when you order, cos you may need to order more items or double servings. Heard their bespoke cocktails are good, but didn't manage to try it. The coffee chicken is a must - try.
3
Kuvo describes itself as a lifestyle concept by tcc. The restaurant is hidden on the second floor of the quiet and rather empty Orchard Shopping Centre, which is next to 313@Somerset. The service staff were ever-present and helpful, but the food was just slightly above average. The Forest Mushroom Veloute was creamy and flavourful, but like the typical decent ones you can find at restaurants. It won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wow you. The bread served with it was slightly warm, but would have been better if it was crusty too. I liked the cashew crust on the Barramundi with Cashew Crust, as well as the curry beurre blanc and ginger-infused kumara puree, but wished there was more of the curry sauce as the fish was a little dry. The Rum Cocoa Mousse Bar was chocolaty and rich, but too sweet for me. I prefer very dark chocolate, so others may be fine with this. There were quite a few rum-soaked raisins and it was a huge burst of booze in each. A bit too much for me, though alcohol lovers would enjoy it. I enjoyed the tuile served with the vanilla gelato
4
KUVO's location is at the old Far East-owned Orchard Shopping Center next to H&M along Orchard Road near Somerset MRT which is surprising because KUVO is gorgeous in its decor, ambiance and generous with it's drinks. I think KUVO occupies the entire 2nd floor of the building so you can look up to KUVO walking down orchard road towards 313 Somerset. I only went there for drinks with a friend who is visiting from the UK because I heard so much about the talented Yutaka-san, the mixologist at KUVO'S Elixir bar and we were not disappointed. The Mixologist Yutaka-san will ask what flavours and what alcohol preferences we have, and just mix us a wonderful and potent concoction of cocktails for us both. I would recommend providing the mixologist with suggestions such as if you prefer sweet drinks or sweet and salty or what kind of fruits you like and so on. Our drinks turned out to be excellent and to our personalised taste buds as well which is a testament to the skill and experience of Yutaka-San. KUVO Elixir Bar is well stocked with a large variety of liquor so you would not be missing any favorite flavours. I would so like to try out their restaurant dishes some day but for now, I am sated with the beautiful taste of Wormroot (a herbal Absinthe) in my mouth from my beautiful sweet and sour lemon cocktail with absinthe, cointreau and infused with other ingredients I am not able to guess at. I do wish the service can be a better experience although I know the manager, Steven Ho tries to provide a good experience chatting with the customers
4
Was introduced to Kuvo by friends and now it's my special spot for a quite sunday night dinner.Service staff are excellent. very professional manager and fantastic bar tenders.Love to eat by the bar and try their amazing infused cocktails.menu is simple but nice. they have european as well some asian options
