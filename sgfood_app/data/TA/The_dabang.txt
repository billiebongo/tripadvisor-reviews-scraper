Dark decor with only stools to sit on and a limited menu of Korean sandwich and breakfast dishes. Everything was greasy and heavy with little flavor. Decent choice of coffees. Bathroom not clean and no toilet paper.

Looking for breakfast on Tanjong Pagar Road, I tried the Eggs Benedict, which came with a load of ham, a small salad, and asparagus: Wonderful. The latte was great, too. Friendly staff, very recommended joint!

非常特别的咖啡屋，截然不同风格！澳洲式的早午餐融入了韩国口味概念就从这里开始！！服务员特别推荐的“Korean BBQ Burger（Beef）份量真的非常足够，独门调制的Bulgogi酱料搭配了多汁厚实的牛肉块真的让人胃口大开！！ 如果不吃牛肉的朋友也能尝试这道”Spicy Thai Salad Burger" 这味道绝对会让你印象深刻，独特的泰式酱料甜中带酸,辣度刚刚好!!!
来杯营养丰富的“Chia Seeds Smoothie"用了新鲜水果汁来搭配"Chia Seeds"绝对让你活力满满！！饮料的名字非常搞笑.... ”Berry Berry Hearty Banana, Green Dream IN Heaven"....
一个让你放松的地方,绝对值得过来试试！！！

One of my favourite cafe near my office.
Serving the best big breakfast and ice cube latte in singapore.
Price are affordable! Will definitely come back for more in future.

This bar cafe has a very interesting concept, serving brunch by day and Korean- Mexican by evening. Their coffees are only for a dollar and its super worth the trip there. Must try if you're around Tanjong Pagar area.

Brunch place by day, bar by night, this spot is great for large eggs benedict served with bacon and asparagus. I also recommend getting the frozen orange juice -- tastes like Tropicana from home. Love the atmosphere or this place.It was also nice that they accepted credit cards here

This place is amazing! A little hard to find, but it's right next to a burger restaurant. Well worth the visit. Food is incredible. The menu says "Australian brunch and dessert with a Korean twist". We got the eggs benedict, which was to die for. Great portions and unique taste. The waitstaff was very helpful and friendly too
