A nice quiet meal after the lunch crowd. Food was awesome not even a space left for dessert...will definitely come back

The sambal is awesomely hot and I like it very much. Together with the dish (in my case boneless chicken) is really awesome.
3
The portion for the boneless chicken was too small and requested to change to boneless fish which was much better. Two big fish fillet. I love the chilli but find the spice level had dropped down. Overall good and we enjoyed.

I am indonesian, spent 6 months in Singapore. There's a time that you'll miss your home food, and most of the time I go to this place if I want indonesian food. It's the closest taste I found in Singapore. 5

I really like the Ayam Penyet (Smashed Chicken) and Empal Penyet (Smashed Beef). The chilli is nice and quite spicy, compared to another local food. The price is quite reasonable as well. Usually packed on the weekends.

The fried chicken here is the signature dish. Crispy and done on the spot. Chilli is to fantastic! If you are into
Spicy food, this is the place! However the soto ayam ( soup) was sold out. That was another winner

Arrived at the restaurant for dinner at about 7.45pm. Alot of their items were not available as it was cancelled from their order chit. Ordered gurame penyet, cumi goreng and ayam penyet. Too my dismay, the standard serve of kangkong veg, tahu and tempe was also not available! The portions were only served with some crispies on a banana leave and crackers to 'make up' the missing items. The sambal/kecap station was also not available. Staff mentioned that "Everything finished" For the price and every item that was not available, it was a very disappointing experience eating at this place

On the 5th floor. A quick and easy options menu for Indonesian dining. All the penyet dishes are good! The spicy sambal is potent. All the friend smashed chicken is fresh and hot. The Es Campur and Es cendol is super! If you go after lunch hour all the seafood dishes are out of stock. So be early!

I almost always come to this restaurant when I'm in Singapore because for me quite hard to find halal food in Singapore and this one is locate in Orchard road. Also this restaurant owner is Indonesian people so it taste really Indonesian.The duck and chicken taste is nice and the sambal or chili is veeerrryyy spicy. For drink we can order teh botol.This is one of recommend restaurant for people that like Indonesian food :

On a hot, hazy, humid day... my last day in Singapore. Needed, needed my last chendol or ice-kachang before leaving Singapore. Searched the entire Far East Plaza.... came across Ayam Penyet Ria. Ordered from the menu, waited 15minutes ...and check out this EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING TAKE-OUT! I should have walked back to ION Orchard in the heat and humdity.... would have been worth the sweat ! My $4.20 was not worth it

One of many hawker style places in the Far East Plaza -food was quite spicy but was enjoyable and we liked the lava style drinks also -service was quick and cheerful. Bit disappointed though that we couldn't get complimentary plain water.

Great food and excellent service.
Cheers to hanapi for letting my girlfriend eat here because of the egg allergy she had. He told us that they will remove any egg related ingredient. Had an amazing dinner.

I like all the food here. The chili (sambal) is very hot but very delicious. I like bakso penyet and enoki mushroom.
5
Food delicious plus the spicy sambal..I try new empel penyet (beef smashed). Malay word say "power gler". Service not that bad. The only negative for me is the potion of rice getting smaller.

Probably the driest chicken in town
Had the set Ayam penyet lunch
Could barely swallow the meat
Came with a bit of sambar and 1 cucumber slice

Do I need to say more? The ayam penyet is delicious! Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The chicken is savory, fragrant and super tasty! Be warned, the chilli is extremely spicy but very shiok (good)! Price is very reasonable ($7.90 for Ayam Penyet rice).

I was a little disappointed with the food for the price I paid (I ordered the Ayam Penyet Fried Chicken). it was okay but for the price, I thought I was looking forward to better quality. But, service was fast for takeaway. To be fair, chilli was good

It's on the 5th floor of far east plaza...next to grand hyatt hotel ScottIt serves Indonesian food and it's signature dish is ayam penyet...which is basically flat fried chicken...The dish is as food as it's samba sauce and this place serves pretty good sauceGive it a try

I had dinner with friends and her family at Penyet Ria in the mall beside Grand Hyatt and the management needs to train their staffs to be more courteous when customers are still dining in the restaurant. They fool around with each other, one did a stunt which if he miscalculate his steps, could hit my friend, and they start doing the closing when we are still having our dinner where one of the staff have started putting the stools on the table. Management must retrain their staffs and they are educate with hospitality service knowledge.

Ala fast food joint. You need to order and pay for your food and drinks. Wait for about 10 minutes and your food will be delivered to where you are sitting. Expect to wait if you arrive during mealtimes. We love the smashed chicken or ayam Penyet. They are generous with the sambal(spicy chili) ... Ssppiiccyy. Burning tongue ...but still we love ...I suggest that when you order , you ask for separate Sambal as what I had done when ordering for my children. And don't forget to take your own black,thick sweet Indonesian soya sauce that also goes well with your ayam Penyet. Other food items recommended are the beef Penyet or empal or fish Penyet. I don't find the Tahu telur nice as I expect the sauce to be more black and Rojak style but the tahu telur there was like Tahu goreng ... The sauce is sweet satay sauce. Some of the items are pricey..
