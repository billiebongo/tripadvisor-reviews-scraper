Spinelli is also one of my favorite coffee place to go while am in Singapore. I like the original spin, you can taste the coffee beans. Most Spinelli are not easy to find, you have to know where it is not like starbucks it's everywhere.

Love the cookie spin and dog bone cookie. Chicken Bacon sandwhich, pasta salad and soup completes a meal

Must stop for my fav triangular gigantic lemon scone when in Singapore. Good coffee. Better than Starbucks and CBTL.

We discovered Spinelli Coffee during a two day stay in Singapore and liked their drinks so much we stopped back while transited through Singapore on the return leg home. Their iced drinks are fantastic. They've got a variety of drinks, the prices were good, and the atmosphere was just right

Good to grab a quick bite while rushing between the office and ... well, the office again. I got a pretty tasty felafel wrap, and a muffin that while ok wasn't brilliant, for just over $10.Come to think of it, I'm now old enough to remember when a muffin would cost you less than $3, but that must mark me out as some kind of old bluffer, confused by currency changes and baffled by life. Ah well. At least the staff were cheerful and quick to serve me
