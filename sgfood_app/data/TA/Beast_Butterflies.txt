This place has good ambience and music. Staffs are very friendly. Books are available to read. Awesome.

Loved the environment and the pork knuckles. Lamb mains was disappointing tho. The service staff were friendly and attentive.
5
Went for a family meal and thoroughly enjoyed it. The place has great decoration and super service. The food was yummy and pricing was pleasing. Would definitely recommend.
5
Nice place, food is good and the children totally love this place. Baby back ribs and spam fries are delicious. The staff is good and gave us good advice on what to order since this is our first visit. Very useful tips.
4
The ambience is great and set in a discreet location. Gives the mix of a retro and futuristic feel. The food is good as well especially the special scallop dish and pork knuckles.
5
Food and service is good! Wide selection of food - western and asian. Ambience is pretty good too! Highly recommended.
4
Food was excellent has the chicken burger, staff were friendly and fast to serve despite the restaurant being busy. Well worth stopping in if you are staying in the area and want a quick dinner
4
Food still good but service seems to have dropped, new staff perhaps but the place was empty though. Will still visit
5
Very good restorant with good prices and delishes dishes! We ordered salad with salmon and crab meet, scallop carpatio and fride crab partties. All dishes were perfect.
Highly recommended this restorant!

Had a business lunch. First, I announced that we had arrived since I had made a reservation. I asked if we could sit outside and that was ok. Then no-one showed up with menues or to take drink orders, I had to step in and ask them to take the order. When I offered to take the menues out myself, it was remarked that it was their job. Well, then you should have stepped out without me having to ask. Mind you, the restaurant was far from full. My business partner was unhappy with the portion of the food being served for the price being charged and sent back the dish. Both the waiter and the manager offered to serve something else, but that would not have solved the problem, The dish was not charged, as agreed. The last part is a more common issue in Singapore.My food was good quality. All in all, I do not think I will go back

Visited this place to celebrate my sisters birthday. Environment was cosy, not too noisy. Food served fast and tasted good. Fusion menu. Instagramable place !
4
Great ambience, good selection of dishes and excellent service from friendly staff. Our favourite dishes are pork knuckle and salted egg chicken bits
4
value for money. ambience was pleasant. not really crowded. could have better music though. good for couples or gatherings
5
Service is pleasant and prompt, despite my demanding kid. Best laksa in entire Singapore though rather pricey...quality make up for it ! Crab cakes also a great hit. Curry chicken not really
2
The food was terrible. My ribs were over-cooked, lack of blend, fish and chips was dry. The pork knuckle was bad as well. Overall experience lacks quality of food and how can kitchen not served truffle fries and tell us they run out of fries
3
i read about the reviews and decided to reserved the place for this special dinner due to its nice environment. price was slight high and food was abit over rated especially the MTM laksa, pork steak and ribs. however i would like to command that their service staff was great.
2
Hungarian pork collar was well cooked. Roasted potatoes were cold and dry, like it was cooked a long time before. Sautéed veges were a very small potion. Just 2 pieces of brocolli and mini carrots.Beef short ribs in tamarind sauce was well cooked too, but cut of meat was very fatty. Had a quarter inch of fat on the top and bottom of the cut. Tamarind sauce was too acidic, pea shoots seemed a wierd combination, mash was okay.Chinese lady server who took care of us was very friendly and courteous. Chief server, a Chinese gent in a orange shirt, however couldn't smile. He was stern when asking to clear the table, and stern when presenting the bill. Quite weird when someone's face is stern when asking if you enjoyed you dinner.

We went because our girl won a $100 F&B voucher. Nice place although it was a little challenging trying to find the entrance to the carpark. They serve Local fares are 5* restaurant prices. Quality wise, it’s alright but I don’t think it justfies paying $20 for a simple chicken claypot rice with lup cheong and $18 for a bowl of laksa with 4 clams, 2 prawns and a few pieces of fish cakes and tao pok. My husband’s order of pan-seared Salmon was simply a slice of salmon and it baked potato. It costs $26.The place got very noisy when 2 groups of larger booking came in. For such ambience, I would have rather gone to food court and pay less
3
A party of 9 on a Saturday afternoon for lunch that stretched to tea time.Food rather pricey. Taste average. Service was average. We tried dishes from both the asian and western menu. The beef short rib was commendable. Laksa was good but too pricey. The durian waffle dessert was delicious except that you would need to share it. There other desserts on the menu was also good. Sorry can't remember it's spelling. One of them was yam. If you like to try new places give it a shot
5
Discovered this gem during a staycation at M Social. The food they served is top notch. Don't miss their lala beehoon, laksa, Claypot rice and lobster porridge! Get crab cakes to share as a starter too. It may sound silly having these local delights outside of a hawker centre but the guys at beast and butterflies do know their stuff! Service is great as the staff are friendly and attentive. The place offers comfy and spacious seating, it's a great place for intimate meals, big gatherings or just for drinks. Have dined here for about 4 times, will definitely be back for more.
4
We keep going back for the pork knuckle. It's juicy and the sauce is to die for! The hot chocolate was served in really cute mugs too.
5
I went few month ago. I order pork steak like korean style. It was good so tasty and also i recommend salad also japanese style with wild salmon. For service also good when i need something they assist very friendly and nice.
4
I like this ambience. The food portion is just right and quality is great too. A little difficult to find unless you know the difference between where M Studio and M Social is located.
5
Brisk friendly service, and absolutely excellent food. I had several meals here, trying different items on the menu. The crab cakes are delicious, and the beef melt in the mouth tender. Recommended.
4
Good vibe and interesting fusion food. The ingredients seem like an unusual pairing, but they came together beautiful. A nice, sophisticated touch!
4
I was a little skeptical to say the least - $18 for a fried lala beehoon?? This, and a few other items on the menu, is a local dish available at hawker centres and should cost a quarter of the price. However, the 'wok hei' (charred smokey flavour) was very good and it really satisfied... I must also add that the beef shortribs in tamarind sauce is also one of the must try items and it did not fail, the second time I ordered it. I had a voucher so I did not hesitate ordering a few of the pricier items but without the voucher, I might have just stuck to the safe / cheaper options.The live band is really LOUD ... wondering if they can adjust the volume. Conversation was very difficult indeed. All in all, quite a good experience both times I visited
4
Had dinner on a Friday night there. Great ambience. Food was surprisingly good. Had chilli crab based clams with mantous, wagyu burger, truffle cheese fries and 2 beers. Desserts were tiramisu and matcha lava cake. Could not finish the fries as the serving was a little big. Would definitely go back and try other food too. Tables beside us ordered Asian food, which we did not try this time round and it smelt so good.
5
 Visited the restaurant during our staycation and were always greeted by friendly staffs of the restaurants whenever we walk into the restaurant. Breakfast buffet consists of a good mix of Eastern and Western food choices and there is also a live egg station. Although the food choices are massive but standard is there! It is also nice to spend the afternoon chilling in the restaurant. They have quite a few good reads you may choose from and there is also a dart machine where you can have a few games with your friends. Otherwise you can just spend your time people watching and enjoy the river view! Will definitely recommend to friends and revisit to try out other dishes on the menu! Keep up the good work!

We had breakfast at beast & Butterflies. Quite sad the selection for breakfast was quite limited but their food are of good quality. Even their plain porridge was yummy. Hubby loved their scrambles eggs most. Hope to go back for lunch or dinner sometime. They have an auto egg chef. Super interesting to see omelettes or sunny side up prepared electronically
4
I read about beat and butterflies in an article when they first opened. I had high expectations of this place. We came on a rainy Sunday afternoon as my foodie 10 year old wanted to try something different from the usual Coffeeshop lunches or home cooked lunches that we usually have. So this was a treat! All 3 kids were excited the moment they stepped through the glass doors as the decor was bright and lively and the seating and furniture rather different from the norm. The food menu was a little disappointing for my Husband and I as we expected more unique food items especially at the pricing stated on the menu. The kids however were oblivious to this and were very happy exploring the restaurant on their own. The presentation of the food was good and the quantity justified. Quality was 'ok'. We would probably go back for the ambience or the buffet breakfast which has been raved about if we choose to stay in Msocial(hotel of the Millenium group) attached to the restaurant. Maybe not for lunch. This rating is based on the collective experience of the kids and it was a nice family outing that day
5
Food was great and so was the service. Was there a year ago and this is second time there. Menu was changed but quality of the food is still fantastic.
4
Good ambience with the lights and good mix of furniture. Great variety of tasty and heart-warming food.
5
The food we had were great! Great taste n well prepared. We love the ambience the moment we stepped in and we were delighted to see the band performed, the band is lovely & talented. Had a great Friday evening at Beast & Butterflies!
5
On the contrary, we found the wait help friendly & accomodating. I like the sofa seats at the back of the restaurant as you can have a viewof the “river” & the people passing by. We liked the crispy spinach, lobster porridge & waffles w Durian pengat; but found the LaLa BeeHoon to be lacking in flavour although the “Wok Hei” was good.
4
I have been to this restaurant umpteen times and it is still my fave. Always indulge in the delectable food and awesome ambience. The new manager, Cassandra, is also very friendly and helpful. This month, the restaurant is celebrating Oktoberfest and they are offering a must try Pork Knuckle Platter. It goes very well with the refreshing special brewed iced lemon tea. Thumbs up from all my friends!
5
Special thanks to Nirmarl ( not too sure the correct spelling) for his hospitality. Great location. Dinner along the river. Foods are ok but a bit pricey. 5 star mainly for the service provided. Keep up the good work. My Friend was surprised with the birthday cake arrangement.
3
Looks promising for a chill out on the river but food is just average and rather expensive, even for a restaurant located at the Singapore River.Staff is not very attentive, especially when you choose to sit outside near the river. It takes ages until a waiter appears
5
Cosy place for chilling out. Love the sofa seats and friendly serving staff. Mix of Asian, western dishes - slightly fusion if I may call it. Live band during weekends. Faves include lobster porridge, sambal chicken Bee Hoon, Chicken satay, sea bass. For desserts, try the yam brulee (taste like the Teo chew yam dessert). I kinda like the millefeuille too. Good for small group get-together (not weekends if you plan to do more chit-chatting as the live music could be a little loud).
1
expensive and not very good, the design is extremely busy and the multitude of screens flashing useless video stuff makes concentration and talking hard due to the visual pollution of the design. When you come back at night other local bars are busy this one is always like a ghost town... which tells you something
3
The menu lead me to a Asian noodle lobster dish, but that was a wrong choice to make. The old frozen flavor of the lobster dominates the entire soup, since there's nothing else of flavors to balance it. Have try breakfast and was a tinny choice buffe
1
I stopped and beast and butterflies while having a walk around quay. I sat at a table outside and waited for 10 minutes. No one from the staff approached me or offered a menu even though the restaurant was almost empty.
4
If you are in this area & a lover of Italian cuisine, you would love its Pizzas & Pastas etc. We stayed nearby & hence could try some of its fare.
5
They have some great music that plays on your table screens as well.
Nice, cheerful bar.
We ordered Kirin beer, and it was good
3
Restaurant looks really chic. For starters, we had the curry spam fries. Totally addictive, was really yummy. Curry here does not mean curry gravy, just means they fry the meat together with curry leaves to give it that hint of spiciness. Portion was also very decent, so we were snacking on this the whole time, even when the mains were served. Tried the clam noodles next. The noodles lacked taste, had to ask for extra vinegar-ed chillies. Clams were the smallest i have seen, so i ended up with a lot of shells, but not much clam meat.Next had the crispy skin roast pork. The skin was indeed very crisp and flavourful, but the meat a tad dry and lean. This dish seems to be a favourite as almost all the tables were feasting on the roast pork dish
3
A friend of mine invite me in this supposed to be a good restaurant. The first impression was good regarding the setting but once we sat, things started to be less glamorous. Once we choose our meal on a tablet.. it took long time before a waiter attended to us. Once order was done, the dishes come when they are ready from the kitchen, in any order, with no regard that guest would like to eat together. ... I was served first and my friend had to wait 10 minutes before getting her dish. I think this is not acceptable in a restaurant which is supposed to be a more upmarket place

On a quiet spot along Robertson Quay, this place caught our eyes. Beast and Butterflies - quaint name.It's a glamorous place exuding with its gold chandeliers and classy furnishings. Just outside, a few ornate tables were also very attractive. And curbside, were simple tables and chairs - suitable for strollers in shorts. We sat right by the path to the glass doors. After 15 minutes, a tall barista saw us over the coffee machine and waved to us. Ostensibly, it was a waiter who came to us with a tablet menu. We mentioned we were there for coffee and dessert. He said he'd be back. we could almost order on the tablet but we didn;t have the password. And the dessert page? well, not promo, not alcoholic or non-alcoholic, not promotions mains or starters.....we never saw that page again. And we were interested in one of the items.The waiter never came out again, so I finally walked in to return the tablet. The bartender (the bar is v close to the front door) seemed surprised to see us. I simply left the tablet and said, after 20 minutes, I guess you do not need our business!Pity. The place is well named for beastly or fleeting service like a flitting butterfly! (at a neighboring joint, we were greeted warmly as old friends - they explained it's the spillover place from M Social Hotel. Whatever- poor service is always a sorry excuse in a classy looking joint

Planned for my husband's birthdaywith his friends and he was treated to one of the "sabotage" jagger bomb by one of them. The bartender decide to treat him for the drink! They recommends and give aweskme advises! Have yet to try the food coz we were done with dinner before going there. The food are must trys! Looking awesome

I should say at the outset that this review is about the place as a bar and not a reflection of the food as we didn’t eat there.This is a spacious modern bar/restaurant and part of the MSocial hotel. It is decorated in contemporary style, with both high stool seating at the bar area and tables towards the rear. The chefs can be seen behind the counter preparing the food. The only problem is that there is no indication of what type of food they are preparing without going in – there is no menu or pricing of any description outside or displayed in any windows.Despite my general rule of never going into a restaurant that doesn’t show a menu and prices, I did go in to enquire the style of food. I was told it was ‘fusion’, which didn’t leave me much the wiser although I would guess that this means a fusion of various Asian foods (Chinese, Japanese and so on). Asking the lady for a menu I was shown a computer tablet, which she began to scroll down. Now call me old fashioned, but there’s a limit to my acceptance of attempts to re-invent the wheel in order to appear modern and trendy so I asked if they had a written menu I could browse through. They didn’t (although the waitress was very charming and offered me the I-pad to look at). Deciding this probably wasn’t for us, but in need of some liquid refreshment, I ordered a Coke and pint of Tiger beer. The bill for this small Coke (smaller than the normal can) and a pint of Tiger was $22.20. That’s considerably more than most places, and providing confirmation that my rule of not to go into anywhere without knowing the prices in advance is a wise one.Overall it has a modern, pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff, but because of the high price of drinks I can't rate it above good (which TA doesn't provide for) - hence the average rating. So would I go again? Well, judging by the price of the drinks I guess the food would be expensive. I have no doubt I could find something among whatever fusion dishes they offered to suit my palate if I could be bothered to scroll up and down a computer screen to see the dishes available, therefore I might go in if I was passing and caught by a thunderstorm. But I doub

I am a big fan of Beast & the butterflies and its my go-to place whenever i have cravings for ham-hock n duck gyoza. It's a nice hang-out place esp on a weekend though it can be abit crowded but the ambience is cosy esp for a girls night out. I am not a sweet tooth person but i will always reserve space for the yam brulee & salted egg yolk waffle serve with durian pengat
3
Huge place different decoration a bit too much but food nice and nice staff too. Even nice outside I also being for coffee once and a drink another time. Have a bar and a pool / billiard . Never is really full so good option tô who doesn't want crowd places
4
Smart and spacious restaurant and good drinks in the bar. Menu could be bigger in the restaurant but the food is great. Loved the chicken burger.
5
This is a great place with great food and services to chill out over the weekend. Order the truffles fries and pork knuckles, 👍🏻
5
I ate lunch and dessert in that restaurant. Fast service and very polite staff. Nice and cozy indoor interior design and relaxing outdoor area.
5
My partner and I had a stay at the hotel and visited this place for breakfast. Stepped in to receive a very warm welcome and beautiful smiles. Not just from the service staffs, chefs embrace high service standards too. Just when I was slightly disappointed with the variety of the breakfast spread, I enjoyed the quality of the offerings. Kudos to the kitchen! Really quality over the offerings. Despite being a buffet, food are warm and fresh. Think of buffet breakfast, we usually think of pastries left there for a long time, I had a very fresh and hot Danish. Really good job there. Totally made up for the shortcoming of variety. I really enjoyed the decorations and ambience. Very detailed in their display of food and beverages too. In summary, the friendly, prompt, proactive and helpful service staffs alongside quality food made it a great meal for me
4
We had the wagu burger and chicken burger, the best chicken burger I have ever eaten! Along with parmesan fries, this was good food but for these 2 burgers and 2 pints the bill was $105SDP I nearly fainted!! Well Singapore is expensive no getting away from it but after arriving here from Thailand that would of bought me 4 days worth of food! That will be the most expensive burger I have ever had! But it is all about the experience. Just to advise most places add 17% to your bill which at their prices really does bump it u
5
We stopped in for a casual dinner and had the soy salmon and lobster porridge. Both were out of this world. Extremely well-prepared and perfectionist cooking. Prices on wine were excellent as well. Will definitely be returning. Service was perfect amount of attentive while still maintain privacy
4
Not sure why it's called woodly pork but this dish of pork collar with kimchi salad was delicious. In contrast, the ham hock pork trotters, said to be a house specialty, was a tad dry. Popcorn chicken was very good. Lala beehoon and laksa were missable. Sambal lobster noodle was good. Leave space for dessert - The yam brûlée served with coconut ice cream was my favourite. The matcha dessert was delightful too. We found the salt egg waffles too heavy and did not go well with the durian purée. Service was attentive and helpful.
4
Buffet breakfast is nice with the egg station, refilling for dishes are very quick, staffs all attentive. Overall in western style, choices of juicy and fresh cut fruits, however, please don't expect wun ton dumplings noodles or steam pork buns on the buffet table of Beast & Butterflies... For myself, its just suits my taste
4
Beast & Butterflies is M Social’s high-end restaurant with a concept that involves bringing people together through food. The food is a mix of East and West and marries them into a fusion offering, like a Lobster Porridge. Their signature Ham Hock dish features a large chunk of crispy German pork knuckle and Asian sauerkraut paired with delectable Nam Jim Sauce.
3
My first impression of the menu was strange, but I suppose that's what you would expect from a fusion-type restaurant. The food tasted just average, therefore I find the food is priced too high when compared to quality. Service was just ok, although I was taken aback when asked if I could finish all the food I have ordered by one of the waitress. This was completely unnecessary.I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends
3
Ordered the salted egg yolk popcorn chicken late night and it was lacklustre. Had buffet breakfast the next day and it was also middling. Porobably won't try to have meals here again.
5
Must try the lobster porridge . Beer is good and the ambience is nice. Service staff might take longer to respond
5
we loved the decos there! the atmosphere was fantastic! it a really suitable place to chill & relax.
Food: its more on a western and asian fusion food. we loved the burger and the ham
3
this restaurant wasnt far from our hotel was busy but had a table for two,food was tasty nice buzz about the place.not much is cheap in singapore but this was on the mid range,only trouble was after the meal when it came to pay they had given our bill to another table and theirs to us, was a bit of confusion but did get sorted,
4
Our friend had booked a table at this restaurant as he wanted to try it out. The setting is really nice, there was also some live music on Friday evening.You can order everything using an iPad, but it isn't as efficient as it could be since a waiter always needs to confirm your order before it is processed.The food was pretty nice and is a nice mix between traditional Singaporean cuisine and modern food.The only point of improvement would be the service as you can wait a bit until someone is available
1
We found out that for $88 per person, all the food (the seafood, the meat, and 'dessert') was cold and were just sharing platters! The flyer was intentionally misleading. We put up with it until they made me wait 1.5 hours for our dessert from 9:30-11pm even with 2 reminders to them. They totally, totally forgot about us despite the reminders! When they brought the icy cold Xmas pudding to us, I asked about the cheese, with truffles, peach alcohol and Bourgogne red wine, in case we had to wait another hour for it. The supervisor then said it was either dessert OR cheese. So, since he brought us the desserts, we don't get the cheese!!! When I asked him why he didn't give us the choices or asked which one we wanted at first, he simply smiled. I was flabbergasted!!!! That wasn't what it said in the flyer at all in the first place. Anyways, the food isn't tasty at all here. Not the least bit. We can do better at home. I really regret having cancelled La Strada and came here just coz the decor looks nice. For the same price, the food quality was superb during last year's Xmas Eve.
5
I found this restaurant by chance when I had to arrange a lunch for my overseas friends. The food choices were a mix of local and western, basically something to please everyone. The innovative desserts were the best, with my favourite being the yam brûlée. Service staff were friendly, helpful and cheerful, always ready to approach your table when you need help. The restaurant itself was hip and trendy, suitable for a night of chic casual gathering. Overall, it was a place you would be proud to bring friends to. I went back 2 more times within a month
2
Went to this place around the soft launch time. I can understand that they got couple of orders wrong, food was average at best. We were given vouchers for the extraordinarily huge mistakes on the bill.We went back after couple of months. Food was still average (at best). I even had to send a dish back. The service was slow and lousy. Won't be going back anymore
3
Had lunch at B&B earlier today. Beautiful restaurant. Lovely warm colours, nice decor, very hip! Wow! I was excited.You're given an iPad that has the menu. 1, 2 and 3 course set lunch. Reasonably priced. But unlike the a la carte page, no description was given whatsoever. Thai Mango Salad. Chicken Salad. Hong Kong Noodle. I ask, " What does the HK Noodle come served with? Pork, Chicken, Seafood? Is it soup based?" Chicken salad. Hmm... Caesar? Vietnamese? What's in the Mango salad? Just... Mango?Without asking, I order the Chicken Curry Rice. (Expecting of course, the usual chicken curry with potatoes and rice.)Well, imagine my surprise when I was served deep fried breaded chicken katsu, rice, egg, japanese pickles and japanese curry. Oh, the disappointment. I don't eat japanese curry, and I was staying away from deep fried anything. I picked on the chicken, and left pretty much everything else on the plate. Would I go back? Yes, for the ambience. And I would like to give the food another go
4
We booked for a lunch meal, but ordered ala carte (lamb and cheese, duck crisps, truffle cheese fries) when we read the menu. The combination turned out quite pleasant. A server offered free dessert in exchange for filling up feedback forms-- what a friendly touch of customer relationship-building!What makes this restaurant stand out is prompt service and its elegant but relaxed interiors. There are some well-curated books on various tables and shelves that patrons can skim through; they make smart and convenient conversations over a meal too. The vibe is positive and refreshing. Will definitely return
