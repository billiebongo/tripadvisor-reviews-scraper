Food is value for money but most dishes are spicy. Crowd catered for heartland and mostly families. Abit crowded and noisy but overall good for gathering.

The spread was ok for the price paid with even a live station grilling satay...it will be great if the queue was not that long though.

Tried both their lunch and dinner buffet since there was a 1for1 promo. It was ok but definitely not much variety. Staff were very friendly and attentive. Nice deco and ambience too. But I wont pay full price for it.

Was here for lunch and was impressed by the selection on offer. Both the variety and quality was excellent. They are having a 1 for 1 promotion valued at SGD40++ and it is truly worth it.One of the few buffets I have been to where they offer free flow of soft drinks and hot beverages

Was there to celebrate December birthday with family, total of 12 pax. 3 seniors, 2 teenage, 7 adults.Satay is worth the wait, it's really nice and juicy. The sauce taste good.Mediterranean spread is great. Soft Pita bread and hummus is nice. Western Pizza is soft with generous toppings, yummy. Spaghetti is alright.Cold mussels, prawns are fresh and top up regularly.Chilli crab is soo small and not fresh. Butter prawn is ok. Sup tulang is ok.Customer service has good intention but due to long queue over at Asian cuisines where the main dishes are, we were somehow 'forced' to get the food for Mediterranean while queuing in the Asian Line.Desert is ok.Just the average kind of buffet. If you are there just for gathering, then it may be alright. Else, if you come for the food, especially seafood, and you are not going bowling, then go elsewhere is better. Advice to go during promo though

It was super crowded although i went on a weekday night with some friends. Booked for 12 pax n given a round table. Had to queue for food. Range of food was average. Nothing much and nothing interesting. Plus the foods are cold and seriously no taste. Good food: satay, cheesecake, kebabOverall ratings:Food range:3/5Taste:1/5Atmosphere:4/5Location:3/5 (i guess there should be a shuttle bus to get to Orchid country club)Service:3/5 (had to clear our own table for space)

Amazing buffet lunch at Royal Palm at Orchid country club. With the current ongoing 1 for 1 promotion, it was good value for money. Interior decoration was decent. The view outside was overlooking the beautiful swimming pool. Staff is friendly and gave a very prompt service. Food choices were not huge but enough to satisfy the craving. Fresh seafood on ice were excellent. Indian corner was good with curry fish head, chicken tikka and chicken keema to choose fro

We are a group of 6 and we went for the buffet dinner. As we wanted to catch up with one another, we were quite happy with the food offered - there were soups and salads, mains and desserts. The mushroom soup, satay and beef slices were good, So were the desserts

We were here for a birthday dinner celebration. Turns out that it is popular pick for celebrating birthdays. We joined in to sing Happy birthday 3 times that night. A must go if you love:-Fish head curry (it's huge)-Sup tulang (very tender)-Briyani-Cold seafood (prawn n mussels are very fresh and topped up regularly)-Cereal prawn  The dessert , salad spread and choices of bread is good and a variety. The mutton satay is good but you have to to be patient, we waited about 10mins. What we hope they could improve on:-The chilli crab sauce is delicious but the crabs were not fresh-Asam fish sauce is also nice but again the fish could be better-The satay sauce is coldStaff were friendly, good ambience and the buffet was topped up regularly. Overall it was good

I came with my family of 4 including my aged mother in-law. We made a reservation earlier and the waiter told us to sit outside (non-airconditioned area) giving the reason that they are fully booked indoors. I refused to sit outside because it was 12 pm and the temperature outside was at 34 degrees! I did not go to a restaurant to sit under the hot sun at 12pm!We would have left and gone somewhere else if the person in-charge of reservation did not allow us to sit indoors. He finally agreed, although unwillingly, and gave us our seat right at the corner. Not a very good start for a family lunch outing, though.I have to say that there was a variety of food options (cold seafood, finger food, chicken, beef and fish dishes etc) for different palate. They did top up the food rather fast so you don't miss out on anything. The food tasted OK. Dessert (like cakes, kueh and fruits) were available in bite sized portions.You can make a trip here since they are having promotional discounts and if you feel like having a buffet to satusfy your stomach. You have to make yourself comfortable. Staff just helped to clear your plates after you are done
