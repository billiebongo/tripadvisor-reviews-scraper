If you are rushing to get out of Singapore but did not had the chance to try some local delights, this is a good last stop for that purpose.

Every time I arrived at Changi Airport I will take time to have breakfast or brunch at Wang Cafe.
I always took 1 set Kaya Butter..so simple and delicious...and the coffee was very tempting..
3
Can have nice coffee or tea but without much choices of food. Just a local coffee shop with local snacks.
4
you can get a good meals here with affordable price with delicious taste. don't miss the kaya toast with a cup of coffee here. you never forget it.

We had the local dishes of noodles, very tasty could have eaten more but we would have missed our flight home !!!!
1
I am not sure if it's laksa from another country, the laksa I had certainly wasn't Singapore laksa. I had for years eaten laksa from other Wang outlets- especially the Hitachi Tower (or Chevron House?) outlet - that all tasted like Singapore laksa.What I had a few days ago at Changi T2 was closer to Curry Mee from KL.I feel that Wang Cafe grossly misrepresented the Singaporean dish
4
It was so good to be able to have an affordable dinner here before our flight home. Great coffee too. I also bought a red bean bun to eat on the plane- I ate it before I left and wished I'd bought more!! This place is in terminal 1 downstairs near the arrivals area
4
Offering snacks and ready-to-serve meals at reasonable prices, this local chain has average food but has very good and efficient service. Best experience was at their Hougang1 outlet that has a helpful and friendly crew who will go all out to make your day. Simple meals with great service way above expectation

Tried their toast and coffee as we saw some locals having it.The coffee came steaming hot but had a nasty smell. However as it cooled the smell went away and tne coffee was nice and strong although it had no aroma as such.The toast was interesting: thin and well toasted but somewhat over toasted with a liberal dab of butter. Sugar on the butter and sugar one and some sort of jam on tje Kaya butter ones. Prices are very chea
3
Probably had several branches in sg. Their changi outlet is located at the back side of duty free departure area. There is a hidden lane there with cheaper options. Wang is one of them. Laksa is good. Free kaya toasts and teh for only 8.5 sgd
4
You must not miss the noodles here. Great laksa noodles with Kaya toast with tasty milk tea. Priced $8.5 for a set.
4
This place have a great taste of kaya bun, and the meal set was affordable prices, good place to have quick lunch
3
This the last place i can enjoy local food, mee siam, before leaving singapore. The attendance is quite helpful to drain the soup so i can bring it home. Sgd 5 for a bowl.
4
Cafe that offers local toast, beverages and delights such as laksa. Fast-to-cook for quick-to-eat travellers and visitors. Appeared short-handed. Cups and utensils were not collected in time. Saw one or two houseflies flying around. Laksa was delicious but at $7.50 it is relatively expensive. Come here when elsewhere is crowded
4
What a nice place to eat at after a very long flight, the only thing on my mind was to eat. It's right inside the airport so it's very convenient. I stayed on the safe side by ordering the macaroni soup set. It comes with 2 pieces of kaya toast and a choice of kopi or teh. Of course, I chose kopi. Their macaroni soup was kind of bland. Or maybe I'm just used to our own version of "sopas". I definitely loved the kaya toast and kopi! Still really good though and affordable at S$7.20

This place sevves delicious laksa. The gravy is perfect. They also have traditional toast, coffee and tea. The butter with sugar toast is also very good with two soft boiled eggs and the tea is in a bigger cup than most cafe selling the same type of food. The kaya toast is also very good. They serve two slices of bread which is more than the norm in other similar cafe. Love to drink the tea there too. When you order the soft boiled eggs, they even break the eggs for you so that you will not dirty your hands. Would recommend this to those who want to bring their elderly parents out for breakfast
3
Yep, it's more pricey than having the same at a coffee shop (kopi tiam) or hawker centre but you get solid food, fairly consistent + air con! OK, in our current very hot weather, air con is a must. Their kopi (coffee) is solid and their kaya toast rocks. They seem to slather less of it though. That's cool coz I should have less sugar. But you won't go wrong have a local caffeine shot here or their toasts. Their food (laksa, mee siam, etc. is so-so
4
Always stop if possible at Terminal 1 Changi for this cafe. Laksa and Mee Siam are delicious, but also the Kaya Toast, you can buy all in a package including a cup of Kopi-O. In the morning they serve Nasi Lemak. All are at affordable prices at a convenient location, next to ATMs and Money Changers, at Arrival Hall of T1 Changi
4
Being a fan of kaya toast as well as laksa it was great that the layover at Changi was at breakfast time. It was almost too heavy a meal for breakfast but delicioius and a good price.Tucked away an extra order of kaya toast for snacking on arrival 
4
Arriving at the Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 1 early for breakfast, I am pleasantly surprised by the quality mee rebus and macaroni which separately come in sets, each with roti bakar or toasted bread and tea or coffee! Prepared by locals, the tastes are satisfying!The macaroni is cooked as soup, much like the noodle soup, even taste better than the latter
3
It's wheat toast with kayabutter. Every time I eat before boarding. Make sure you can tell the difference between Kopi, Kopi O, Kopi C.
4
Food is pretty decent, tastes good and authentic. However it's pretty pricey and seating is pretty limited. But it makes a quick good light meal before you board the plane. Usually have it for breakfast.
3
Good place for a quick bite before you board the plane. I like their coffee and kaya butter toast. Rather quick service.
2
just finished the curry chicken set with laksa set.normally I would not comment this bad. but because I think this place is comfy and also good service. but the taste of the curry chicken need to improve. it doesn't have taste at all. laksa is quite oke. thank
4
This is my "go to" place for breakfast before boarding especially for those morning flights. I can get my Kaya toast with tea and a noodles dish. They also have a range of western coffee - expresso, latte or just plain local coffee. Location is facing SIA parking bay and you can watch planes taxi-ing to their parking spot while eating!
4
Tried this from friend recommendation. Price wise is not so cheap but the portion is big. You can order 2 meal sets for 3persons. Really value for money. Good option if you just arrived and feel hungry or hungry before depature. During dinner time this place could be very crowde
1
Fierce staff, who are arguing with each other loudly, got scolded for taking the "wrong" food. Flies near the food collection point and dirty tables. Inconstatant food quality, my toast was much smaller than the table beside me. They may be nice, but perhaps another outlet.
4
I used to have my meals at one of its outlet near my house whenever I have craving for kaya butter toast and French toast. I also used to have their mee siam for dinner on a weekly basis. Unfortunately nowadays I need to watch my diet and I only go there once a month. I like most of their dishes but some might feel the price a bit too expensive considering you are only paying for a few slices of breads and you can have the same items at foodcourt/coffeeshop. No comments about their service as most of the servers there recognized me as I used to eat there quite frequently
3
One thing I noticed is they change their soup recipe. The soup had more flavor now. This is my 2nd times in past 10 days. On September 25,2015 I ate at the one in departure terminal. It was very good which strong flavor soup, lots of topping i.e pork balls, fish slide, 2 boiled eggs and Tofu. Today I had lunch there in Arrival Hall after passing custom. It was no fish ball at all. All topping I got was fish slide, tofu and 1 boiled egg. The soup is 20-30% weaker than the one I had on September 25. But still better than a few months back. You don't really know what you will get here @Wang Cafe.
1
I had a laksa and lime juice drink. The laksa was the worst I have ever had. I note that one of the reviews said the laksa was burning hot, but mine had no flavour or heat at all - just disgusting. The lime juice drink was so sweet that I couldn't even taste the lime. It was like drinking corn syrup with ice
3
I order Laksa Set which came with kopi and Kaya toast.
The soup was flavorless ; no sweet, sour or salt. It's just water + chili paste mixed.
Kopi and Kaya toast was OK up to average level.
4
The cafe has many franchise in Singapore i dine in Changi airport and suntec city mall the laksa and kaya bread was very good and the coffe as well ^^
2
We had laksa which was lacking in flavor. Perhaps they use plain water instead of broth for their soup. I wish that we had bought our lunch elsewhere.
4
Service was quick and pleasant. Foods were tasty and fresh. Average prices in comparison with other airport. Not alot of space to attend your food there were limited tables available. Will visit again definitely!
4
Laksa is burning hot. Beware if you're sensitive to chili.
Happy to eat something delicious & familiar before leaving and immediately on arrival.
The best thing about this place is the Local breakfast you can enjoy anytime before flight or on arrival.
5
at this coffe shop the quality of the coffe they you is very high the staff was great its very near to the soping area its nice for small rest
3
24-hour outlet at the airport terminal 1 arrival hall. Best to buy the combo set priced at S$5 - S$6. My preferred choice here is the curry chicken with white steam rice and coffee. One of the cheapest place to fill your stomach in the airport
4
I was at the Singapore Airport in the middle of the night and decided to get a cup of coffee before my next flight. There were just a few places open. When I saw B. F. Wang's, I remembered reading about it and decided to give it a try. At that early hour, there was not much of a choice, but I got the special-- 2 boiled eggs, toast, and a big cup of coffee-- for about $5. Quite tasty, I thought. The cashier refused to take a tip, so I gave my change to the next customer. Highly recommended, but you might want to scrape a little of the butter off
5
We both had curry chicken with white rice, it was spicy, delicious & filling and such a BARGAIN (about 6 SGD)!! My tea was delicious and hubby's coffee was smooth, rich & also delicious. If you're passing through Singapore's Changi Airport stop by and have a meal, you won't be disappointed!!! The restaurant in arrivals terminal one is open twenty four hours
3
This is a reasonable choice for kaya toast and local tea once you've passed through security. For $5 you get 2 eggs, kaya toast and tea or coffee. Or pay less for a subset. Always amazes me how prices at Changi Airport are about the same as in the city
