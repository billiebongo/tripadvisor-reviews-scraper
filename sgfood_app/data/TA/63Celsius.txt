Conveniently located in Asia Square but signage is not clear, so may need to look around before you can find it.
Set lunches are good value.

Really good tapas, although they're are not a tapas place. We had good drinks and a couple of taps and enjoyed them. My Friends stayed for steaks which the place is known for but I had to go to another place for dinner.

Great food and ambience. Portions were just nice and value for money, given that it is in the prime CBD area.

I enjoy the food at 63Celsius. The food is good, service is superb and atmosphere is nice as well. I would definitely go back there again for dining.

I went there for lunch. Their burgers and pasta was very nice. The table and chairs are quite high so it is not a place where you will stay hours talking but for lunch or short drinking, I think it is quite good choice. Location is within Asia Square so makes it more accessible for the business meetings

Place wasnt very packed on a Saturday night for dinner. Small seating area but spacious. Servers were really friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. 5 of us had some tapas to share.Kurobuta charred pork belly (special $33) - their seasonal special, quite generous with the amount of pork. Meat was cooked tender and flavorful, charred skin can literally come off the fatty cut of the meat (and the fats part too is cooked firmly). Good itself even without any sauce!63 chicken rice ($18) - supposedly one of their must try dishes. Sous vide chicken was the best I've ever had, extremely moist and soft! Rice was good but not as flavorful. Chili doesn't come with a kick, not spicy enough. Wylarah wagyu striploin ($48) - beef was cooked medium rare as requested. Amazing cut, no tendons and fats was just minimal. Macallan 12 years sherry oak ($15) - smooth!homemade ice lemon tea ($5) - refreshing and light! Truffle fries ($16) - can be better, truffle taste not as strong and it was a little tough instead of crunchy. Tuna tartare ($20) - really small pieces, tasted good with the sauce.Lettuce & vinaigrette $14 (add salmon trout $8) - really fresh and large lettuce, salmon was just normal.Tomato cheese & herbs ($18) - cheese was sliced and shaped like a flower, cute and thin! Tomatoes too were large and juicy!Toriyama Japanese striploin ($60) - didn't taste that! Overall price was expensive, $300+ for the 5 of us but the food was amazing! Slight improvements can be made but still worth the visit

Luckily we made our reservations during lunch hour as if we did not, we probably will have to go somewhere else. Food was good! Wagyu burger will be awesome with less ham put in. Kimchi fries very good as well. Chicken rice is very expensive but chicken was very tender like it was sous vide. Overall very good

Family of 6 dinner. Ribs were excellent. Burgers tasted very good but could do with more condiments and dressing. It looked rather plain. Fries were very good, perfect crisp and size. Sous vide chicken rice is a novel idea but somehow it lacks the punch in taste in the richness of the rice and chilli. Spicy seafood pasta was sublime. Amazing sauce! White chocolate dessert was excellent at previous visit with generous portion but on this visit, portion was unbelievably small. Portions need to be consistent. Great wine list and overall a very nice experience.

Restaurant does a great happy hour business, and has good drink and food menu. We had a table of 10 folks (previously reserved a table) and drinks took awhile to arrive and came out in phases, but both appetizers and entrees came out quickly and tasted great. Prices were reasonable and nice marina location! I would definitely go back.

Both my mother and I tried to make reservations over the phone for a table at their paragon outlet- none of the 5 calls made between the 2 of us were answered. In the end, I had to make a reservation in-person at the restaurant/cafe. It's a small place and while classy, is still casual enough not to feel intimidated. Thankfully the food was excellent and the staff, knowing how exasperated I was with the reservation process, offered their apologies and made an extra effort to make us feel welcomed. The beef items are pricey but the rest are actually OK. All 3 dishes we ordered- beef, seafood pasta and pork- were very good. Would go back again once they've ironed out their reservation system.

Menu has interesting offering. Tried the Unagi-Udon tossed noodles. It was better than I expected. The udon is soft and chewy but the taste is quite nice combination. Personally, would have preferred the udon to be a little more al dente.

Just enjoyed Friday evening happy hour. Ordered some wine and fries. No complains and service was friendly and good.
5
Good food and coffee. Will visit again. Indoor seating is limited though but outdoor is sheltered so that's ok

Chose it cos of its location. Food was OK, but i didn't like my sangria and the water took forever to come. Actually I got it myself in the end. But otherwise it was fine.

After having read raving reviews in the ST, made a dinner reservation 24 hours in advance for my husbands birthday. It turned out to be a small cafe with limited seating, limited menu and unaccommodating staff. We were directed towards the most undesirable seat at the entrance despite that reservation,opposite the counter- a table for 2 while they did have better seating options available. They were all apparently reserved or so we were told but remained unoccupied until after the closing time. I ordered the only vegetarian dish on the menu- the pasta which was all right, nothing to write home about. My husband ordered the wagyu beef- 3 tiny cubes with no sides for S$60.00 but was good he said. Would I go back or recommend? NO. It's too exorbitant for the ambience, menu options and the price, above all the attitude.

We were a bit surprised that a new place that describes itself as a restaurant, bar and specialty coffee joint did not have decaffeinated coffee at dinner, and offered to make weaker coffee instead. The food was fine, if oversold. Wagyu before every beef option raises expectations that weren't met by the taste. The caramelized apple tart also wasn't caramelized
4
Been here several times for coffee and it's always the best coffee I have in the CBD. The banana bread is a great addition to your coffee as well. I've had the food once and whilst good we had to wait over an hour for it. Which at lunch is pretty dossapointing if you're a worker bee

I enjoyed my lunch at 63Celsius. The lobster-broth crab pasta satisfied my carbs-craving. Portion is a bit small though. Our dessert of the coconut custard toast was heavenly. A little bit too rich. Must be shared. I could have do without the Bailey's ice cream actually.

Sat outdoors for a fairly large party of ten. It is a bit hot outside and perhaps because we were sitted quite far away, service was not that attentive. Pasta was good. We tried 3 out of 4 of the pasta offered. Appetizers were also good. We had the seafood chips, chicken karrage and the truffle fries. One of the beef burger that we ordered didn't come out with the right done-ness.

Hailing from Halia, the new Chef Ken is good! Adventurous, rustic and true to keeping the natural Flavours of the ingredients, he whips up dish after dish of Creative passion. Try his chicken with ginger pesto, aglio olio king prawns, or the truffle fries. And don't forget the Omakaze for the regular customer! This is a bistro but not just serving bar bites but good food
4
Food was excellent, from presentation to the taste.
Service however was slow. Dessert was served first.
4
For a pitstop for Beef Cheeks Stew or Wagyu Beef with a good range of beers or wines, you can come by this place. Certainly not fine dining but and expect a pub like sitting atmosphere inside.
4
The food was great but just that the premises is a little small. Serving was just nice for dinner. Not too much nor little.
4
Scallops wrapped in bacons are the best.
Chicken is a bit dry. Sauce is good-spicy enough. Mashed potato is tasty.
Beef sliders are good - juicy and full of flavor.
5
Enjoyed ourselves at 63 Celcius. Would recommend the Beef Cheeks and salad. And Salted Caramel Lava Cake. Service was very good!

Went, a bit by accident, for a last minute business lunch, and yes the place was full. Got a table quickly, very friendly staff by the way. Being meat eater, we tried Open Face Steak Sandwich and the Steak & Egg's with Chimichurri.Both meat being Wagyu Ribeye, were tender, tasty, cooked medium rare perfectly. And the portion are ok for lunch (will be too small for dinner).They do also serve good coffee. Didn't try the wines as nothing exceptional.Overall, nice lunch, for a packed place in the CBD area

Got a call bright and early in the morning (9 am) to confirm my lunch booking, the sweet young lady prepared me for the fact that there were only outdoor seating available. Given the cooler December setting, I was fine with it.Restaurant was hip, definitely looked more a place to hangout and have drinks. Food menu looked good. The waitress was still chirpy as ever, remembered our conversation this morning, and obviously knew the menu well and made some excellent recommendations. We had pasta with the sea urchin, the wagyu beef sandwich and the seafood platter, washed down with a refreshing sangria. Too bad, we only had an hour for lunch, but it only means that we will be back in the evening next time for a nicer/ longer chill out session...

came here for drinks and had some of the pub food. first time here and it did not make a good impression. the roast pork was too dry and slices are a bit too thick. the fried seafood platter was so so only. we had some other stuff, but i guess after all those drinks, i have forgotten the taste of them. it was happy hour when we went. the servers are pretty friendly and got all the orders right. kudos to them. it's in the banking area so it gets crowded pretty fast

I was introduced to this establishment by my colleague and I could say that I did not regret visiting the place for a lunch. As I am a big fan of seafood and pasta, the Squid Ink Tagliolini made me want to try it out. The dish brought quite a subtle umami to your palate and what I like best is that it does not have a strong aftertaste. The server asked if we would like to order a chocolate pudding (sorry, I forgot what is the name of the dessert) and he assured us that it would not be too sweet. Sharing this with my colleague, I agreed that it makes a serious closing to the very nice lunch. My only wish is that the restaurant has a lunch set menu with attractive price

Went there when they have the promotion for the set menu. However on top of it is the free flow champagne deal for 1 hour which is Totally good deal.Very strategic location at the Asia tower where you will always see people chill out after a busy working days
