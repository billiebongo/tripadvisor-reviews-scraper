A cafe of character, very rustic and warm atmosphere. Coffee was impressive and they have an open coffee-making area concept, which was very unique. Food was fantastic! Definitely one of the better cafes in Singapore!

The coffee is amazing, a cosy corner with refreshing tasty pastas and breakfast sets. The prawn fettucine cost lesser than $19 and had 6 tiger prawns! worthy!

If you're looking for a cafe that serves good food but is away from the crowd, you'd like this place. I love their breakfast food and for drinks, chocolata calda is the best thick hot chocolate I ever tasted.

Chanced by the cafe for brunch. Small little cafe at level 8 of medical center, it has an outdoor garden dotted with bamboo and willows. Indoors, you can observe the baristas deftly crafting the next cuppa coffee. Service's great for our case. No service charge, so tip if one finds service is good. =)

Heard on the good review so i visited the cafe inside the building. It has a small garden which is nice to dine in depends on the weather. Food generally taste good and not too expensive. The only drawback is the cafe is enclosed area so you will surrounded by all kind of smell, you won't feel in the cafe that much but after you walked out from the cafe. you will find yourself "smelly"

When I got there (my very first time), nobody attended to me, so I called up the waiter (in grumpy mood) telling me its free seating. Maybe the restaurant should put up a signage for the first comers? And so I waited for a good 15 minutes, was contemplating if we should just leave but finally I managed to get one outside. Abit hot but not complaining. Great ambience and I love the mini garden so I tried to get the waiter to help take photo for us but he was rudely asking/yelling us (while taking order from the other table) what do i want, and the guests were looking at us too. That was embarrassing. So in the end I asked the other waitress to take photo for us (he never came to our table)Anyway the food is good, we had fun. even though there was a hiccup on the service. I hope they can fix this issue. Not asking for great service but at least just be a bit more friendly l

What a welcome switch of ambience once youstep into the eatery, way from the long corridor of clinics and 9th floors ride up the elevator from cold medical centre lobby.The place has a warm, cosy and comfy feel - a long wooden table with benches occupied almost all of the narrow interior. There are one or two tall tables for two in whatever space is left in the corner. Sun lovers can opt for more spacious lounge sets in the garden, although the humidity can short circuit your intended lingering eat and chat meet.The place serves a variety of coffees, breakfast choices, pastas and desserts.Even though I was there for lunch, I always had the 'breakfast grande', if I recall the name correctly, which is the full continental breakfast. I also enjoyed the salad. My partner ordered the duck breast plate which he found it too be salty overall. The service borders on casual and no-frills.One thing to note is that the cafe only accepts cash

I was looking for a place to escape the hustle & bustle of Novena Shopping center and found this hidden gem. It's located on the 8th floor of Novena 2, also known as Novena Medical Centre. It's quiet, friendly, has both indoor and outdoor seating surrounded by plants and yes, they serve really good coffee. Somebody there has a serious coffee Jones because they roast and blend their own beans so you know the provenance of every cup, just ask your server. I didn't try the food (I was just there for the coffee) but checked out what people were eating around me. From presentation to generous portions, La Ristrettos appears to put the same attention to quality to their meals as they do their coffee. I will definitely go back for more research!

My go to whenever I'm in singapore. Such a cute place. Love the coffee bags from different countries hung up on the wall. Friendly staff and so efficient. Service is always quick and the food is SO good. Hands down these guys make the best French toast I've had anywhere ever! Their entire menu is superb. Quality food, ingredients and beverages. I've bought organic teas from them on occasion. Just perfect this place

Tucked away in a small corner on the 8th floor of Novena Medical centre... worth the effort to search, seek & find. Coffee is authentic - service is quick & there is both indoor & outdoor seating. They also have a food menu.. both breakkie & lunch !! Check it out...

I ordered the Chai Latte ($6) and smoked duck under the all-day-breakfast menu ($14). It's fantastic. I also liked the outdoor rooftop garden ambience.
will return to try the famed coffee menu!

In the Square 2 shopping mall, take the lift, next to Old Town Coffee to level 8. Turn left and walk down, till you see the cafe, which is surrounded by medical centres. In the early morning when I visited the cafe, it was the only one that was opened. Dimly lighted, the place gave a cozy feel. There was not much of a crowd, just 2 couples around. Only cash and NETS was accepted here.Flat White (S$5)An Australian origin, similar to a caffe latte and is distinguished by thinner froth on top. The drink was served in a cup with no holder. The drink was rich and thick.Breakfast Crab Cake ($15)Potatoes, Pancetto, Avocados, Poached Egg, Wild RocketsThe crab cake tasted a tab fishy, but quite meaty. Interesting the potatoes was presented like a mashed potato patty.Pear Tart ($8)Baked pear tart with vanilla gelatoThe serving was bigger than expected, about the size of a small pan. The tart smelt quite delicious when served. The crust was light and crispy, and sliced through easily. As it was served hot, the gelato melt rather easily. Overall the food was not bad and the place was quite relaxing

I was staying at the Oasia Hotel and was desperate for a good coffee. I found this place on Trip Advisor and was determined to find it. Hidden away on level 8 of the Medical Center across the road, it was worth searching for as the coffee was superb. The guys that run the cafe are real artists when it comes to their coffee so don't pop in here if you're in a hurry. It's worth the wait for a small, strong latte. They also have interesting panini style buns for breakfast as well as a limited menu of favourites such as French toast. Just one word of caution - CASH ONLY or mets.

Tucked at the 8th floor of Novena Medical Centre, you can hardly expect many walk ins. But this place is quite a gem serving good food. We had the chicken panini, scallop pasta, French toast and duck breast. The first three were all delicious! The last was decent. However, the cafe is rather small and cramped especially during lunch time on weekdays - hardly a place for you to sit and chat and laze around for long. But if you are in and around the vicinity, this is a cool place to check out
5
This is a casual breakfast spot hidden between clinics on the 8th floor of Novena Medical Centre. Good service and great breakfast with many options. Also coffee is good. It was a big surprise find this cozy place in such an unimaginable location. Will come back there for sure
4
Hidden between clinics on the 8th floor, this small casual cafe serves decent fare and coffee for brunch. A large table in the centre and a side bench plus a small table caters for no more than 20 although you can sit in the open outside. Service was fast and we enjoyed the meal
3
Nice coffee, we had cappuccino and flat white. Frittata was sizzling hot when served, service standards would be rated better if all of them are consistent is service delivery. Indoor sitting area or space could be bigger if there isn't that pot of big plant around. Alfresco area is good although Singapore weather is generally hot most times. View is good as cafe is located at 8th floor

It's a nice cosy cafe, where coffee is the main sell but as I discovered, the food's not bad on its own. I tried the crabcake breakfast ($15) - the crabcake was thick and fleshy, the avocado slices and arugula were nice, the poached egg was done nicely. The potato was average and there was a very small piece of pancetta, which was a bit disappointing. But the crabcake did redeem the dish as a whole.Service was minimal. I wasn't greeted upon entry, nor shown a seat. Only when I approached one of the staff did they speak with me. They weren't overtly rude, but they could have been at least polite enough to say hi and direct me to one of the seats (or even say, feel free to sit anywhere). When I left, I passed the counter, and the staff who would likely have seen me didn't say bye. I'd say go for the breakfast (I didn't try the coffee), preferably before 11am (when it got a bit more crowded), and don't expect too much from the staff

If you're looking for a cheap brunch spot around Novena, then La Ristrettos isn't bad. There's good variety on the menu, though there could be more egg options. The indoor area is small and was full at lunch on a Saturday. The outdoor roof garden is pretty. Brunch with a hot drink came to about 18SGD. Reasonable. Particularly when you can spend three or four times that down the road in Orchard. Service could be improved

Was recommended to this cafe by a friend. Quite interesting that it is located in Novena Medical Centre level 8, surrounded by various clinics. Despite that the indoor environment is small and cozy and does not remind you of being in a medical centre at all. The coffee smell great and while I didn't have any, my friends enjoy the mocha, mocha with ice and cuppacino. Pasta also look good, my friend finish her whole plate of Cabonara pasta and my healthy breakfast is good too. The only thing I think wasn't that good on my plate is the chicken breast - a tad dry. The poached egg in the salmon dish could be better I think but my friend did finish all of it. We also have the pear tart and yes, we cleared the plate clean. Would recommend for small groups as the indoor seating is very limited. But the food is decent and the drinks are generally good. Note that they don't serve decaf. Deserts are about $8/ plate. And mains are about $15.

I've order the panini and the portion was huge and the chicken fillet was really crispy topping with avocados and sprinkle of cheese powder.... It's really delicious... The place was really hidden at the medical centre... I like the atmosphere too....

Had breakfast already and was abit cautious for a Coffee shop in a hospital.
Outcome exceeded expectations.
Nice vibe, nice coffee, delicious cookie and will definitely come back for one of the delicious looking breakfast dishes.
Price wise its good for Singapore.

Visited this place and they have excellent food and coffee. Must try the piccolo latte and their Carbonara.

COffee lovers. Come enjoy the laid back atmosphere with a cup of coffee here. No regrets. Guaranteed.
They have a excellent menu to accompany that are all worth a try.

I visited this place for coffee and Sweet. All staffs were not the same set of faces I saw for past years. My coffee was a little burnt. The Pear Tart which pear was a bit too hard and I couldn't finish it. The base was nice and crispy though. Imagine that person who's on the kitchen was changed too. I will take a break for now on. Can't get my coffee and sweet right time.

Do note that they are closed on a Sunday, i had to return on a weekday to check out the place. A nice & cosy place that serve good coffee. Looks like they grind their own coffee beans as i see huge equipments at the counter. The food was pleasantly nice and with nice presentation. This place is worth checking out. Its at the 8th floor of Novena Medical Center and its surrounded with clinics. Do not doubt once you alight the lift, continue to search for La Ristrettos.

The coffee here is truly amazing. The experience of a cup here is fulfilling mind, soul and body (without wanting to be melodramatic about it- but it really is wonderful). The food is also delicious. I have had their breakfast crab cake as well as their salmon. Both were well prepared and fresh. The atmosphere here is also charming, with plenty of soothing greenery and a lovely retreat from the hustle and bustle. Thank you for this wonderful little sanctuary!

We went in today at 4 p.m. I try to order Tiramisu to go with my coffee but it was finished already. Our flat white still very good as usual. We look at the menu and agreed to pop in next time for some lunch. Lots of choices here. The Price was fair. The Service was decent. Nice ambiance indoor & outdoor.
5
Hands down the best coffee I have had in singapore and delicious fresh breakfast options. Its in an odd spot, on 8th floor of novena medical centre but i will try and make an excuse and get back here soon. nice warm atmosphere and big open shared table and tables outside but the coffee is what will call me back

We visit this place today August 25,2015 after finished with my doctor. The place decorat nicely both inside air con section and outside garden area. Luckily I just step in around 11.15 a.m. just before lunch craziness begin. The quality of Flat White that we ordered were so good in terms of aroma and taste. I will definitely be back next time for more coffee and may be check on their food also.
