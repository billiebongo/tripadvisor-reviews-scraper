Chef Kenneth recommended us to a short rib for steak. It was quality and in addition to the ambience, great place to chill out and enjoy good food in the heart of CBD on a sat night!
4
Loved the burgers and fries, it was cooked to perfection - juicy patty and crispy fries! Will definitely return to try other burgers. (tried the mushroom and BBQ burger, the mushroom burger was my fave!)
5
Awesome burgers which lived up to it’s hype! Tried the swordfish burger and blue cheese burger (this, for the 3rd time now) and the standards for the food is ever splendid.
Staff was attentive and service was great.
5
Ordered the swordfish burger and blue cheese burger. Both were excellent!!! Light and tasty. Would come again.
4
The seafood platter was big and really fresh. After 3 of us shared it we could only share 2 burgers, which were delicious. Of course we upgraded them to waygu!
4
Welcoming and attentive staff, nice ambience and delicious food. Ordered the blue cheese Wagyu burger, second time having it and was not disappointed. The burger was juicy and succulent, thoroughly enjoyed it
4
The food was good. It gets crowded so you better book or Chope it. It can get noisy as it’s a small place.

Was there for an early birthday celebration. Surprisingly the Lobster Roll was not the one that blew me away, but the Swordfish Burger my dad had. I was fresh and tasty. As for the Lobster Roll and Salad (which my mum had)... I think there are better ones out there for a more valued price. On the flipside, staff was friendly and even the chef came out to have a chat with us after the meal to ensure everything was ok (P.S. yes we did let him know the Lobster Roll could've been done better)
3
Verdict: With so many other restaurants to boot along the Telok Ayer stretch, I wouldn't come here again. Value: Serving portions are standard size - Not too big. Not too small. Food: Taste was sub-par. Scare factor was when a fly crawled out of my salad and my burger, and when I had informed the waitress, she took my plate, only to returned me with a smaller portion of salad and still the same burger. I lost my appetite thereafter.Atmosphere: This was probably the saving grace of the whole night. Couple with my friend who made me laugh, I believe I could still laugh with the same friend, different environment. Service: I wouldn't come back here again
5
We arrived very late unfortunately, just after the kitchen had cleaned up and closed, however the waiters and kitchen staff were incredibly hospitable and still accommodated for us.The recommendations were great and the food was excellent, with two of us ordering whole lobster and ordering one lobster roll too. Probably one of the best lobsters I've had, and once again the service was commendable. Thank you very much
5
Burger were awesome with good Crab cakes. The sword dig patty was awesome - good variation from the usual beef.
3
The restaurant is quite small so it's best for 2-4 diners. Food was decent, we ordered a burger and the lobster roll, however it would be great if the lobster tasted fresher. Price is on the high side.
3
Used to be the best lobster roll in town with great french fries and salad, since they changed the flavor is not anymore the same
4
A whole lobster for $52++ is fairly good value for Singapore, and it was a fairly good experience on the whole.
5
Go for the steaks! Had the wagging, no regrets. Lobster was good too. Value for money. Will be back again! :)
5
wonderful appetizers, steak and porkchop done perfectly. One of the best pork chop around, fatty, moist, tender, perfectly seasoned.
5
The best "American" meal I've had in nearly two decades in Singapore.
The special holiday turkey stuffed with chestnuts and cranberry was moist and flavourful.
The happy hour wine options hit the spot!
5
Nice food and ambience :) 2nd time here. Highly recommended for friends celebrating birthdays or couples celebrating anniversaries :)
4
Very cosy and intimate setting. The staff were very friendly and attentive! Had mussel bisque and oysters for appetisers. Personally not a fan of bisque but the oysters were very fresh and juicy. For mains, we had the lobster and porterhouse. Loved the lobster... didn't need any elaborate sauce as it was good fresh. Porterhouse was huge! Very tasty but each cut was a bit too thick for my liking. Overall still would recommend.
4
Came here for dinner last week with some friends. We had quite a lot of beers and shared some appetisers and a giant T-bone steak. The food was really quite decent, but it's not cheap for steak here. The hefeweizen beer is definitely better value for money than the beer on tap. Overall a good night
5
The restaurant is easy to locate and the dining is satisfactory every time. The whole grilled lobster is as good as the lobster roll, highly recommended!
3
Not fantastic & very pricey!! Only the mussel in lobster broth was commendable~ But the price is not justifiable~ Not to mention the restaurant is very small & seating are squeezy~ =(
5
The food is great, staff is nice. If you go to the market grill have meat! It's the best choice!!! They cook it perfectly and it's such a good quality
Yummy
5
I like the lobster roll and asparagus grill,is fresh and tasty. The service is good and will visit again.
3
Market grill continues to serve nice food especially the lobsters but the prices have increased from previous visit.
4
Went there for dinner and was satisfied with the quality of food. Price was on the slightly high side though.
5
I was told that they have 2 seating timing for dinner period. It was not listed in Chope so be mindful if you like to stay a little longer.
5
Food was perfect, service impeccable! Will definitely visit again to try some of their other dishes!
5
Great lobster and steak. My to go place for lobster as it's fresh and worth every penny.
Service was on point too
3
I went to the restaurant for family dinner.The restaurant was quite full.We ordered lobster sandwich & bbq burger as the main with beer.Personally, burger was better than lobster sandwich in taste and price.I recommend that you can try this restaurant for couple date ONCE. :
4
Great place for a quick lunch with good food and service. Well priced and the restaurant is always full. Enjoy the experience.
5
We went to The Market Grill for dinner. Ordered the Chicken Burger and Swordfish Burger. Good ambience and fantastic food.
5
Have been passing this place for so many times and finally decided to try their burgers!
The pork patty was so well marinated! love it :P
3
I booked for the cod burger which was in the menu on their main website. But the menu on chope shows swordfish burger instead.
4
Went during 1-1 burger promo during lunch. Excellent taste and value- had a swordfish and BBQ beef burgers.
5
The food standards are still very well maintained since the last visit.i had lobster roll;lobster chunks are encased in buttered toasted roll with fries which tasted real potatoes (soft and mash inside,crispy outside)my partner had the newly designed menu burgers which are terrific too! Sesame buns are fragrant and the combination of the mains are interestin
2
Food quality is ok but service made the entire experience awful, especially for the kind of prices they charged. They had 2 seatings and while it was stated clearly in the app that you have to vacate by 8pm for the first seating at 6.15pm I didn't expect the restaurant to be so pushy about it. By 740pm, a server comes by to ask if we had any last orders. Then just before 8, someone brings the bill, without us asking for it. Yet they forgot to bring the ice water we asked for 30 mins ago.Not impressed and certainly not returning.
4
Went on a Tuesday night, place had a good relaxed vibe and wasn't crowded. Food items are mainly meat based and tends to be higher priced. We chose the burger items which were more affordable and also because we had the 1 for 1 deal on chope. Burgers were a tad too oily but still the dressing and meat was really good. So hard to stop eating the fries they were that good. Service staff was attentive and the chef also came by to say hi and ask for our opinion. We also tried their apricot apple crumble which was good and big enough to share amongst 3 people.Overall a very good post work or date night place with the relaxed vibe and good service. Burgers are cooked very well just a tad too oily. Expect to pay a little more for the higher quality meats
3
Came with friends for the lobster roll since I have heard raving comments about it. We also ordered some sides like pig ears some other northern italy weird stuff that my friends liked. The mussels with white wine broth was fantastic and it was so good i had to keep reminding myself that i still have the lobster roll after that. The lobster roll was kind of disappointing. I guess it was meant to be cold or lukewarm like some kind of stuff salad in a brioche, still, i would have preferred if it was much hotter. The sauce was only ok, nothing interesting. I cant believe a $50 lobster was actully inside the brioche because it just doesnt look like it since it was so small. I think for the price, taste and size, there are definitely better places elsewhere. The grilled asparagus was nice though. It was juicy and well cooked. I would prefer that to the lobster.Overall, yes to mussels no to lobster
4
Steak and bone marrow were really yummy and not wallet busting. Service was non-obtrusive and pretty attentive. I wrote in to say my friend and I were celebrating our birthdays, hoping that if it were crowded, we might not get the bar seats. Instead at the end of the meal they surprised us with a scoop of ice cream topped with a candle each. It was a small thoughtful gesture which was very much appreciated.
5
The lobster is fresh and juicy. The service is also good. Very pleasant dining experience. Highly recommended!
4
Good place to go to for a quiet lunch. Tried their burgers and they were not bad. Fries were average though. Service was good as they were friendly and prompt.
5
We went there because of a one for one burger promotion but received great service anyway. We had the swordfish and pork burger and both were delicious and really well done. Fries were amazing. Their lobster rolls and lobsters are a must try too.
5
As the title suggests - try the chargrilled lobster. Been here 3 times previously. Didn't disappoint.
5
The service is excellent as the staff are friendly and polite. We all ordered the lobster roll and grilled lobster! The lobsters are fresh and good!
3
My boyfriend replied their FB message to plan my surprise when they confirm the reservation with him, even though they say they will help for the surprise, nothing happened when I was there. The staff pretended that nothing was going on and no surprise nor candles was given. Can tell that their service isn't up to par and they are inexperience in preparing for surprises like these so please do not go for special celebrations because it will just spoil your night :(Lobster roll ($52) was good, fresh thick chunks of lobster meat mixed with mayonnaise, served on a crusty and dense brioche bun. Fries and salad that comes with it was boring though, no effort made Wagyu rump ($58) their special for the day was good, ordered medium rare and came cooked perfectly. Thick chewy yet easy to swallow. Red wine sauce was served with the rump, rich and flavorful. Mash potato was buttery and smooth, served plain.Scallops appetizer ($26) came was 3 small scallops, seared but not cooked on the inside. Tasted great!! Corn purÃ©e and fried corns were a great compliment to the scallops. However overpriced for the portion served.Ice lemon tea ($5) came with sugar syrup by the side. In my opinion, it tasted not as good as the others I've tried. Little sourish with a really weak tea taste.Apple apricot crumble ($15) their special of the day. As it was served with some granola and vanilla ice-cream, you'd expect the crumble to be served hot but it came cold which was weird. The crumble ratio was little compared to the Apple and apricot filling, making the pie a little sweet. The bottom of the pie also contain caramel sauce which made it even sweeter! Eating with the vanilla ice-cream made it even worse because it got SWEETER & COLDER lol. A weird way to serve.Overall the mains was good but hope that they can improve on the small things like the sides, desserts, drinks, service etc. restaurant too was VERY cramp and tables are very near to each other with no privacy
5
There's a ton of positive reviews on the lobster roll. However give the burgers a go as well! We ordered the chicken burger and mangalica pork. Not your typical burgers. Juicy patties and great toppings / sauces. On top of that, we highly recommend the mussel bisque! Oh added tip - do yourselves a favour and add a sunny side up to your burger
5
I haven't had a burger like this in Singapore. Top quality. Meat: ordered medium, perfectly cooked, slightly pink and very well seasoned. The beef patty fills the bun, no extraneous bread. Toppings: blue cheese paired with a onion marmalade and smoky bacon. These were perfectly balanced. Bun: a walnut bun, soft and fresh. This burger was so legit I was surprised to see everyone else in the restaurant ordering lobster.Also ordered the grilled asparagus, which was smoky from the grill and tender to the very end. The quality of the ingredient, like those in the burger, was obvious. I also appreciated sitting at the counter and watching the guys in the kitchen prepare the dishes. They were meticulous, taking great care in the construction and plating of the dishes. Friendly staff as well. Can't wait to return
5
Ordered the pork cheek (from the daily special), with grilled leeks and eggplants on the side. Pork was done to perfection. I couldn't stop till the plate was clean. Staff was attentive and made us very comfortable. They also take on our feedback positively, and offered not to charge my friend for the burger that was under done. It was interesting to see that there were several families with children at the restaurant. Would have preferred more of an adult crowd but we had such a nice experience that we would definitely come back again
3
Ordered the Lobster Roll which was fresh and solid but seasoning can be better. Like it that the bread was grilled and not oily deep fried style. I also order the Angus Beef Prime Rib and Oyster but they are not to par. Decent with slight disappointment as it is considerably pricey
4
We ordered the grilled lobster. It was extremely fresh and succulent. The flesh of the lobster was bouncy! Will try the lobster roll next trip.
4
Craving for lobster so do some research on it.
Love the open kitchen concept~ But it's pretty warm, probably I'm seated near the kitchen OR they only turn on 1 aircon.
Good food, value for money. Craving satisfaction~ :)
4
I had the black angus steak and lobster roll, both were satisfactory. The price is around $50 per person at least. It wasn't mind blowing but good enough.
4
Always good for burgers although this time I tried the lamb rack.
The Lam was grilled perfectly to medium rare. Excellent flavour and seasoning. Recommended
1
I was there with my family celebrating my birthday. The waitress was extremely rude and unkind to us. Making difficulties for us till we wanted leave the restaurant.
4
Best to have the ribeye without the sauce. They're able to bring out the full flavor of the meat. The blue cheese burger was good too. They didn't have too many other things though (e.g., no complimentary bread that you'd expect at more upscale places, few choices of salads / appetizers). Would go back here again for the meat
4
Went there for a birthday celebration. We waited quite a bit before our food came but it was certainly worth the wait. Their steak was extraordinary, we tried their chicken burger and it was very tasty- sauce was just nice, not too heavy and salad had a fresh, tangy dressing. Besides the food, the waitresses were very polite and cheerful!
3
Came to try their much-raved cod burger but was somewhat disappointed.The bun was nicely toasted and buttered, and I liked the smooth yet firm texture and char flavour in the cod, but I thought the herbed mayo and cherry tomatoes were too sour and were a distraction to the cod's delicate flavours. It was much better when I ate the cod on its own, and the rest separately.I also wanted to pair the burger with a glass of sparkling or white wine and wanted a recommendation, but the waitress walked away before I could ask
2
I was there last Friday for dinner, introducing - what I have described as "the best burgers in town" - to my friends. We were informed that they have a new chef and that the menu was slightly changed. Unfortunately the blue cheese burger, which we btw 'upgraded' to Wagyu beef was nothing like before. The old fresh tasty bun (home made?) was now a standard 'supermarket off the shelf sesame bun'. Also way too big in size for the burger it self. The upgraded Wagyu beef was ordered to be medium-rare but was just too well done. My wife used to say that she actually preferred this burger to the like of NYC's The Spotted Pig (I couldn't agree to that but definitely the best that I have tried in Singapore). But this was nothing but a standard average tasteless dry burger. Please inform the new chef to not try to cut corners, cost cuttings or whatever you are trying to do because what used to be Singapore's second best burger is just around the corner!
5
First visit for my partner birthday celebration.Angus beef was well cooked as requested for. Medium well is really medium well.Lobster was so fresh. As fresh as it could be. Juicy and sumptuous.Ambience is not bad. Oh and did I forget to mention.. their Suntory beer is so damn smooth~~ $13 for a pint at Happy Hours is so worth it
4
The cw chicken taste good.. Lobster roll i feel still okay.. Can be nicer. The service was good. Shop abit small.
5
the lobsters here were very tasty and fresh, and surprisingly at pretty decent prices compared to other lobster-themed joints in Singapore. the other seafood items on the menu were pretty decent as well, and the staff polite and service prompt. go try!
3
Lobster roll had lots of lobster meat which was good, but was a little bland. Pork chop was very good.
4
Was entertaining a friend from overseas. The pork chop and the bbq burger did not disappoint! Chop was a bit pricey but was tasty.
5
Our family of 5 adults and one 2-year-old took a cab from the northeast crook of Singapore to this cosy little restaurant to celebrate my parents' 41st wedding anniversary and boy was it worth the $30 cab ride. First off, the wonderful staff made special arrangements to accommodate our party of 6 which is big for this little place especially for a walk-in. We had the black angus prime beef rib, seafood Platter and green & bleu salad - which I highly recommend for its fresh spinach crunch and delightful candies bacon! After sampling the 3 freshly shucked oysters that come with the seafood Platter, we found it was not enough and we ordered another half a dozen! The fromage blanc was the perfect light-hearted finishing touch to our best meal since returning to Singapore this year!
1
Saturday evening -got a table outside and was requested to surrender the credit card upfront - and no wonder - not surprised if people do a runner from this cateGORically awful place, either because they did not get their food within 1.5 hours of ordering - OR getting the most shameful and disgraceful food I have ever been given - not served - anywhere!In a group of four we ordered leg of lamb, two serves of Secreto Pork Cheek - flown in from Spain - or rather the pigs must have walked to Singapore - that dish had nothing to do with pork cheeks - more like leftover rubber bands from a Christmas party long time ago - and indeed, 200 grams - more like 90 grams spread across this wooden plate - and chimichurri sauce - an autopsy should be done in order to find that sauce on the plate. But the "best" part was the CW cod fish - so called grilled pommery-marinated buttery Atlantic cod, vine cherry tomatoes (did not come on the plate), romaine lettuce (did not come on the plate), lemon herbed mayo in a Parmesan bun - where did that go? What was served was just the ping pong ball looking extra terrestrial items - and the only thing missing was the bib - this is what you serve children when trying to teach them how to like anything but the bottled milk. Table next door - also outside - was about to leave after 50 minutes waiting for a medium rare hamburger - when the food arrived mysteriously. Look, whatever you do - DO NOT EVER ENTER THIS PREMISES - THE FOOD IS SIMPLY NOT WHAT YOU ORDER - IT IS A SHAM AND A SCAM - AND THE PRICE IS SIMILAR TO A ONE STAR MICHELIN RESTAURANT. Totally disgraceful and shameful - and whoever owns this disjointed joint better fire the entire crew - and please hire someone who can speak and understand and comprehend English taking orders

After my recent trip to food paradise Japan, I found it painfully tough to give an unbiased review of Singapore's steak joints without comparing with the gastronomic artistry of the Japanese kitchen masters. Perhaps the Japanese are blessed with the 3 greats Matsusaka Ushi, Kobe Beef, and Ohmi Beef (I will like to add Takayama's Hida to the accolades too) BUT even unnamed, run of the mill cuts are magically transformed into tongue swallowing orgasmic culinary experiences by Japanese masters. I observed that it's their dedication, finesse, specialization, pride and focus all contribute to their pristine creations in the land of Michelin stars.Back to my Market Grill experience - we had both Wagyu Rump and Beef Hanging Tender which were really average compared to my Japanese experiences (not compared with Japanese wagyu, just run of the mill cuts). Taste-wise, it was again average without any melt in your mouth feeling and hint of sinewy chewiness. And worse, the miserable cut (certainly didn't look 200g) cost as much as the A5 Hida Takayama.One would forgive the pricing if the restaurant's ambience and service was superb but sadly it's just a notch better than a pub-like feel with unimpressive service.Sorry, won't be back again but I will definitely make regular pilgrimages to those steak nirvana I discovered in Japan
4
Stopped in for a dinner as the establishment looked great from outside in a street of very mixed eating places.The interior is nice and not expensive looking.A barrage of chefs behind open kitchen who are exposed to all diners which is appreciatedThe Charcuterie plate was good but would suggest a tad overpriced compared to other similar plates in other places but is tasty varied and well presented The menu has something for almost everyone's palate and has interesting items. Wine list is ok for size of restaurant.Main courses of lemon sole and the surf and turf were very tasty and we'll presented and more than enough to leave without feeling hungry or ripped off.Is it worth the money .... I believe yes.. most food freshly cooked and good quality and the stars cooked to your preference in front of your eyes. Is it not the cheapest in the street but dollar for dollar certainly worth it.Service was very good in general ... why not 5 stars ..... for the price the restaurant uses cheap table ware one with a cravk on side plate, glasses and mounts a plastic bottle of ketchup on table combined with making you reuse the starter cutlery for mains .... when you pay the $$ I expect a fresh set of cutlery!Overall worthy of visit and I'll certainly go back again
2
Just been here and a birthday dinner, as the food is good and reasonably priced. However, this is my second experience of poor approach and short sightedness.We ordered a Charcuterie Connnoisseur Board, which came with six small bits of bread. As this wasn't enough for the meat and pate, we asked for more bread, only to be told it would be $3 extra, which I think is poor. Our bill for three was $298 on a Wednesday night, when the place wasn't that busy. The previous visit to this, we arrived at 20:45 and were told "we are only serving main course, as we want to close soon" stupidly we sat there and provided this place money..... never again!I can go to Le Bouchon on Club Street for excellent steak and be given free flow French fries and here they can't part with some bread!..... I won't be back this time
5
We came at 9pm on a Saturday night and we didn't need a booking. But don't come at his time if u don't like a quick meal as they close at 10pm. But they didn't rush us. We the fresh Maine lobster chargrilled and the ribeye steak. We also ordered the beetroot burata salad. At 75per Pax for lobster and steak (surf and turf). We thought not only it was amazing value for the quality but the food was awesome. We highly recommend this place. Only downside is there are only 3 tables that serve a party of 4. All other seats are bar stools and 2 pax seats. We stayed till closing at 10pm and every staff was cleaning every part of the grill and kitchen.. great food, chilled atmosphere and clean kitchen.
5
Randomly stumbled in. Amazing cheese and egg burger. Friendly staff and reasonably priced (by Singapore standards!)
4
The lobsters were reasonably big and the sides were good as well. Around $50 per piece. Quite filling. Small and cosy area to bring friends along. Only minus is you can't book. Phone reception however will give advice on when to arrive to prevent disappointment.
5
Had dinner recently. Ordered the deep fried pigs ears for starters which tasted quite yummy. The dip was not fantastic tough. Grilled codfish and house special burger were fantastic. Big portions as you could even upsize the burger further. Did not try their Lobsters this round but will definitely try their lobster roll in the future.
4
We came in on a Friday evening when it just opened (6 pm) but we were not the first customers! That gave me a pretty good vibe that this place must offer some good food.The place was pretty small but clean and I felt that the restaurant was also tastefully done.As we waited for our order (200g Black Angus Beef Steak - S$42 - and 500g Lobster Roll - S$48), delicious aromas just wafted to our noses from the cooking area and we were anxious to begin eating.My husband was particularly interested to get his hands on his lobster roll. He's the person whose favourite dish in Chinese wedding dinners is the Cold Dish (first) and he eats the lobster/shrimp and nothing else. He tells me that the dinner just goes downhill from there so you can just imagine what a lobster roll would do to him.With all our expectations mounting, we were a bit stunned when my beef steak came. It was a piece of meat with some caramelized onions on top and a tiny jug with the red wine sauce in it. Hmmm, was that it?Then, we saw it. THE. LOBSTER. ROLL. It looked absolutely perfect. Chunks of lobster were bursting from the bread roll. All I could think of as I looked at my beef steak was, 'I should have ordered THAT one!'My husband was, of course, thrilled. He started digging in with relish and even though we had promised each other to share half, he asked if he could take 3/4 of his lobster roll instead.I did manage to get a few bites and it was really good. The bread was slathered with butter and the big chunks of lobster were fresh and succulent. There was more lobster than bread! Interestingly, there was a tinge of horse radish (wasabi). It was our first lobster roll and it would definitely be THE benchmark of other lobster rolls to come.Luckily for me, the beef steak wasn't bad too! After popping in that first slice, I found that the meat was tender and super juicy. There was a nice tinge of reddish-pink in the centre. The mashed potatoes (side) was one of the best I've eaten too. Creamy and delicious without any sauce!Dessert was the Rum Banana Pocket. I was disappointed when it was first presented. It looked pretty small and lonely on the big white plate even though there was a scoop of Rum and Raisin ice cream. However, it was pretty good. There was just the right amount of sweetness and we enjoyed munching on the caramelised bits. The total bill came up to a whopping S$123.05 for the two of us, inclusive of drinks. Even though the food was good and the service was excellent, it's definitely not a visit that we would be making weekly
4
Went here with some mates on a burger hunt. There are a good choice of burgers on the menu and buckets of beers are reasonably priced. The wine list is quite reasonably priced too (for Singapore). We also had the bone marrow and crispy pigs ears. The food was exceptional. I liked it so much I went back a few days later with the wife. We had the crispy pigs ears (again) and the duck rillette to start. We also had a bavette, a French cut of steak which is rightfully becoming more common in Asia and the rest of Europe. It was beautifully cooked. We also shared a lobster, which was reasonably priced at $48. We didn't drink that night and the bill came to $200. So not a cheap place to eat, but considering the quality of the food, it was worth it. Be warned: 1. The restaurant isn't open on Sunday lunchtime (as I found out to my cost on Fathers day). 2. There is only one lavatory. I had to wait for 10 minutes while one of the staff used the only loo. Not a pleasant wait after 5 beers
5
Small little place, not many seats and no reservations taken. Proper, and I mean proper, wood fired grill down one end of the bar turning out beautifully cooked steaks and ribs and chops and and and....Food was fab, had a great chorizo starter along with roasted bone marrow. Burgers are good and my grilled pork collar was amazing. Limited wine list, in process of renewing it apparently, but the house red (Chile) was perfectly ok. Place was packed, on a Monday so they are doing something rightReally worth a visit.
5
Heard about their Lobster Roll so went to try. It is amazing and they also have some very nice meat and grill with charcoal which makes all the difference. Delicious food and great service from Angel and the team. Will sure go back for more !!!
4
It is surprising good. My friend and I visited the place on Tuesday night after 8pm. We're lucky that no queue. The lobster roll is fantastic! Every bite is meat !!! Love the sauce , it is not too creamy and bun is grilled jus nice. Cons: the wine selection is not a lot. Specially house white n red. Both are from chile.
4
I have been going since day one as in the same street as my office. The burgers and steak are a great standard. The lady running front of house is fantastic. What I really like is the fact that the have half bottles of wine which is very unusual and a great idea.Just re visited and had the Bavette french cut steak with wilted greens.... very good. Its a little bit expensive
5
Wonderful little place in a great local neighbourhood. You must try the breakfast burger any time of day. The fresh seafood and lobster rolls are also delicious. Service is always attentive and they even have a smile (which can be rare in Singapore). One of our favourite places to go as a couple or with friends
4
Went there for lunch one afternoon and we had a burger each which was really good. Good house wine selection but don't order the Caesar salad..can't believe they used the tiny small 'nasi Lemak' anchovies in it.
Will go back to try their other meats..
4
Great place conveniently located on Telok Ayer where it's reasonably busy even on Monday nights. Food is of good quality and it has an easy going atmosphere. I will definitely go again.
4
Lobster is very nice, steak is great, bone marrow perfect, oysters very fresh, descent wines. There are not many things not to like about this place!
5
Quite pricey but really great place. Nice atmosphere achieved by cool interior design and layout, great service, superb steaks. Top class restaurant in fun neighborhood.
4
Proper char-coal grilled eat and seafood of US type. The restaurant is not big and does lack a degree of coziness, but the food is prime. Enjoyed nice salad with blue cheese, and burger with cheddar and bacon and fries and BBQ-sauce. Freshly grilled lobster with butter looked fabulous and got great review. If your tired of wok and rice this is the right place to go.
4
Yes, price is steep here ($45 for a lobster roll) but I can't stop coming back for it. I've had Luke's and whatnot, but no bread roll can win market grill's brioche. The roll is not very "saucy" (like other rolls out there), more "authentic" in that sense. Their cod croquetas are also fantastic when served with their garlic aioli. I always order an extra serve of garlic aioli for my lobster roll
3
I've visited for lunch a few times trying a variety of their dishes. From the pork cutlet with apple sauce to a classic burger to a steak and others. All of which were okay. Not bad but the memory was that it was more money that it was worth.Otherwise it's a typical pricey meat place on a street full of eating options.I like the option to sit at the long bar to eat
4
A good place to have dinner on a Monday night. However the tables were placed quite near one another making conversation not so private. The choice of music was excellent but more bar-like, also the volume can be toned down a little, as it can be distracting. At times I find myself trying to concentrate to hear what my companion was saying. Food was fresh and wonderfully prepared. I had the Charcuterie Connoisseur Board (an assortment of spiced and cured meat) for starter, the pan roasted cod with truffle-infused mustard sauce, and rum banana pocket for dessert. Love the dessert!!
1
OK, if you are super rich, then the restaurant is OK, if you believe that value for money is important then you gonna regret to get there. The restaurant is nice with a open kitchen, watchout to not smell food after lunch! The meat is good, but the dressing is mediocre, nothing in the plate except onions and the meat....At 70 boxes the steack, I would appreciate fresh fries....If you request extra sauce..they will charge you 3 boxes...the service was very slow and not very friendly, only the bill came fast.Overated, clearly...I believe it was a good place long time ago...

After being recommended to this restaurant from my sisters colleague I was still surprised. Service. 10/10. Pat was amazing. Working as hard as two people.Food. 10/10. I go somewhere back home quite regularly because of how much I love their burgers. Now, I will have to travel back to Singapore for the best burger I have ever tasted.Complete experience. Priceless. I could not recommend any more highly than this restaurant. Given its price tag it is surely everything you pay for. I will be returning before I leave 100% thank you so much!

A big favourite in Telok Ayer, despite their no reservation policy and only walk-ins can get a table.
Worth the wait.

I spent 14 years living in Manhattan and the Market Grill is as close to a Manhattan eatery as one could get. From the marble floors and cool ambiance, to the suits at lunch crowd, and th "to-die-for" menu such as the succulent lobster rolls or fish burger. Outstanding quality and value!! Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed...unless you can't get a table ;) Call 1st and make a reservation

This restaurant should really be cheaper than it is. It seems like the kind of place where you should try lots of different plates (it's all delicious), as they give you a food card at the start. But then you get half way round, with not very much on your plate and you've already spent 60sgd! If they adjusted their pricing, I'd be a regular here. Shame

We had a very good time at The Market Grill: food was very good ; waiters were kind and attentive (and smiling!). We were lucky to find a table for 4 people available when we arrived (this restaurant does not take reservations).I recommend the burger with blue cheese and the burger with Portobello mushrooms. The dessert with banana and rhum was quite original, crispy & sweet, with rhum-raisin ice cream, very good. When we ordered dessert, we had to wait about 20-25min, but as waiting time was long, a waitress offered us complimentary sorbets to keep us waiting. What a nice gesture! We were a table of 4: we had a bucket or 5 Hoegaarden, 4 burgers and 2 desserts for a total of 200 SG

There are some restaurants that truly care about their customer's happiness and satisfaction and some that are too "artistic" and self-absorbed to care. Sadly, this place is that later. You can read all the complaints about the decent food with bad service down below; however, for me the problem was as simple as the lighting. We had to use the lights on our phones to read the menus and could hardly see the food when it arrived because dim lighting is perceived to be cool. Sorry, but burgers aren't THAT COOL. Lighten up and turn on the lights.

This is 1 of those new fangled places where you can sit at the bar over the open kitchen. There are tables too, if one prefers that. Stumbled upon this place while looking for a place to eat around telok AyerLooking at the menu, they seem to specialize in lobster and steak. For starters, we shared the wagyu teaser. It was basically a few thin slices of wagyu over rocket leaves. 1 of the young sous chef whispered the dish as she was handing it to us and we had to ask her a few times what she was saying. Pity about her confidenceThey have other stuff too, and we ordered the burgers. My friend had the blue cheese, while I had the cod burger. Both were goodThey have a short wine list, basically 1 white and 1 red if you want just a glass, and about 10 different bottles of red and whiteOverall the service was also fine, not sure why other reviewers were so upse

I like a lot of things about this restaurant which have brought me back twice so far- it's menu is interesting and the food is good. It's not terribly expensive and the portions are decent. The atmosphere is really nice- it has a warm, convivial vibe about it.And then the Service goes catastrophically wrong and ruins the whole experience. On both occasions I have arrived for a late meal- 9pm or 9:30, only to be informed that service ends at 10pm and I must be out the door by 10:30pm. Sitting down and being told I must order dessert and coffee before I have ordered and received a drink is utterly rude, as is standing over me waiting for me to finish the last bite so that the check can be dropped. I made the terrible mistake of doing a business dinner here the first time and was put off by the hovering waitress standing at the end of the table using Jedi mind tricks to get us the hell out.I am not sure what is more important to this place- maintaining happy customers or ensuring the place is clean and all customers are out by 10:30 pm? Does a restaurant make money by being spotlessly clean or by providing an enjoyable experience such as, I dunno, being able to enjoy the meal?? Their kitchen is Zen- super clean and people scurry to scrub everything- so much care goes into this. Who is the star of the show, the patron or the immaculately clean counter top?So much effort has obviously gone into the decor and the food, which is why I tried again, and liked my meal but failed to walk out happy. Clearly, the values of the service team are iron clad and that is disappointing. If you are an early eater, in at 7pm and out by 9pm, you will probably have a wonderful, unrushed meal. Otherwise, wait until they sort out their service issues.

Telok Ayer is full of surprises. How could I have imagined that the best burger in Singapore was waiting for me in Telok Ayer, in a restaurant that does not take reservation?I was asked to arrive at 6:30pm to experience a great burger, it was exceptional.

We had lunch at The Market Grill. We ordered black angus beef with homemade mash potatoes and a blue cheese burger..Nothing else to say that Food Was really amazing! Meet was tasty, tender, well cooked.. Yummy!!Moreover, our waitress was really nice!It's a little bit expensive but it definitely worth it

Having read the mix reviews, still insist to date my wife for a lunch. It was a busy lunch, filled with people but not their waiting staff. It is extremely difficult to catch their attention throughout our lunch. Waiting staff chatting with their bartender seen to be more important than the customers. Although the food is decently good, but I think for the pricing that we are paying, we deserve better service. $140 for lunch, it is really on a high side, think we can get better service from food court. Maybe the owner can consider self service. At least they are honest not to charge service charge

Excellent food, good service, beautiful lobster and burgers! There is a no reservation policy, so you might wait for a table, but the wait is worth it.

Packed restaurant on a Thursday night, very welcoming, exquisite smell when you enter, good menu.
Lobster and beef were both super delicious and fresh.
A top restaurant.

Sometimes you just crave a big fat juicy burger. Sadly in Singapore we've beed disappointed too often. That is until we stumbled on The Market Grill. really it's a good steak and lobster restaurant but they take just as much effort over preparing their burgers. We've been three times and not been disappointed. We've tried most of the burgers and enjoyed them all including the lobster roll. There's a good wine list and the starters are large, you can easily share one.Not tried the steaks yet but they look good.You can't make a reservation, so it's a bit hit and miss as is the service which could be a bit smarter. despite that we'll keep coming back

We went as a group of 8 and unfortunately they weren't able to accommodate us and so we had to sit as 2 separate groups which was disappointing. The staff were quite rude and unhelpful about this tooHowever, once we were seated the food did make up for this initial experience. I think it was one of the best burgers I've ever had and the steaks were excellent too. Annoyingly you can't book and the service isn't great but if you go during the week when it's less busy and if you're a small group it is definitely worth going to.

We came with friends to the Market Grill. There was 8 of us which the restaurant found extremely difficult to accommodate. We couldn't make a reservation before hand as the restaurant does not take reservations. The servers and the manager were all very reluctant to find a solution to seat the 8 of us and this resulted in us being seated at 2 separate tables. We ordered a selection of burgers, lamb rack and steaks. The burgers were great, though they should be at $25. The rack of lamb was fine although there was a hair in it (this was deducted from the bill). The sharing meat plate at around $110 was terrible. The meat was asked to be cooked at medium/rare and it was served well done and tough. That was a waste of money. Once was enough at this restaurant and I wouldn't recomment it to friends
4
I was there with 4 friends and we shared a steak and have a burger each so all of us can try the different ones. Everyone is very happy with the taste. If u are there try all the burgers! It's was a tad bit overprice, we paid $40+ each

My friend and I had made proper planning to dine here a week before. We even studied the menu in deciding our dinner together and which wine to order. Excited we were, we got to the restaurant about 10-15 minutes before opening time. We waited outside. As we got in, we were welcomed with smiles from the staff. As we already knew what we wanted, it didn't take long before we ordered. We had asked for 1/2 bottle of red wine but an unopened bottle of chilled red wine served. We always like our red wine to be at room temperature but we were advised all wines chilled else they would not be drinkable. Even for unopened bottles? We changed it to a bottle of white wine instead. Then we ordered a 600 gm Wagyu rib to be shared. Instead a 200 gm Wagyu rump served. We had made it clear we were sharing our meal. 200g gm not a good portion to share with a bottle of wine. There is a difference between a rump and a rib. We spoke to the floor manager and was taken aback when she said "Never mind, the staff will pay for it." We don't need to know how the restaurant deals with mistakes done by staff but to make us feel bad for mistake not ours just not a pleasant way to start our dinner. The way the matter handled could have been more professional, empathetic rather than pushing it around. The 600 gm Wagyu rib ordered as Medium rare but was more to medium/well done. Besides, the loud music playing possibly not helping in getting our orders right.On the positive side, the lobster was good. We ordered another one

I was there with 5 friends and we shared our burgers so all of us can try the different ones. We ordered the lobster roll which is not bad, the bread is good, the beef burger is also not bad and our favourite one is the cod burger. Not just me but everyone is praising about the taste. If u are there try the cod burger! It's a quite steep on the price, we ordered 5 dishes to share among 6 pax, we paid $43.80 each.

This is our new favourite burger joint - due to our other one closing doors. Retro interior, we dined early, therefore not crowded. Have had blue cheese, portobello & BBQ burgers. All consistently good and served by attentive & efficient staff. Try it out you won't be disappointed

We wanted to go to another place with my mom, which turned out to be full, so we decided to try The Market Grill.It was a very good surprise. I liked the looks of the place, which is quite original, a bit retro. We sat outside and it wasn't too noisy despite the street as there are less cars in the evening.The service was indeed very friendly, always checking we were doing ok.And the food was really good. We had the lobster and cod fish. There is a tank with fresh live lobsters and you can see the kitchen and grill, all so neat ! the fridge with the meat is also very appealing. The cooking of the fish and lobster was perfect and the sauce was separate so we could add as we wanted.I don;t like mushrooms so i wish they would have been able to replace it with more than salad. But the lobster came with really good mashed potatoes.The prices are definitely a bit high, but still affordable and really worth it for good fresh products and cuisine.I'll definitely go back and recommend it

The food was good cooking. Fav dishes were the Bavette, frog legs and crispy pork ears.
Did not like the noise level coming from the music.

Really enjoyed my dinner at The Market Grill tonight....the onion matchstick was yummy...ordered the lobster..a must try !! The creme brulee was the best that I've ever tasted...
Will be back soon....

I have eaten at this place on a regular basis since they opened. Lobsters and steaks and great burgers.I am not a big fan of lobster (a bit of a snob having grown up in lobster heaven) so I will not comment other than to say they look good. All the steaks I have had here have been really good; but, for me the burgers are the big draw. I love the blue cheese burger and the cod burger is the best fish burger I have ever had. The staff is friendly and professional they seem to care the way someone would if they owned the place (maybe they do?) I have never had a bad dining experience here.Get a cod or blue cheese burger with some matchstick onions next time you're in the neighborhood - you will not regret

As one who dines out regularly in Singpaore and throughout the region, I generally believe that restaurant service is poor compared to other parts of the world. Sadly, The Market Grill wins the award for the worst customer service if there is such a thing. The robotic and completely unfriendly or helpful 'manager' did nothing to accommodate our party of 4 upon arrival, for the second time, to secure a table. We first approached the restaurant and were told that while no tables were currently available, our name and contact # would be taken and a call would be made when a table cleared. Being told it would be 30-45 minutes, we opted to walk to a nearby bar for a drink. 5-10 minutes since leaving, we got a call that a table was ready but it could only be held 5 min. As we'd just ordered cocktails, we drank them then returned to the restaurant. No tables. Curiously, a 4 top table was occupied by 2 diners. I asked it they might be graciously moved to a 2 top so that our party of 4 could be seated. No. 'The other diners would be coming'. We patiently waited on the pavement outside and I can honestly say that in more than 15 min. of waiting, no other diners arrived nor did any table every become available. Perhaps a long story about a restaurant I never actually dined in, but the way we were treated is a 'warning' to others to stay away from this place

We've been here several times now and will keep going back so long as they keep to current standards... Certainly one of the better places for a burger, and their Live Boston Lobster sliders are delicious too! They're not cheap... add a side of fries (at $8 and not included w burger order) and your burger plate goes beyond $30... And the Lobster Sliders are $45, no sides... But you do get a quality meal so fair's fair...If I could ask for just one thing would be better extraction of food smell, though I'm sure it would be a costly thing to fix... After every meal there you will wind up smelling like a griddle... Cannot schedule important meetings after an outing there... That's it.

I like the atmosphere of this place and the design, it reminds somehow of a mix between an english and american grill bar. The food is good, burgers probably the favourite on the menu. Maybe a bit overpriced but that's the case for most western restaurants in Singapore. Would like to go bac

We went as a party of four to this restaurant on Friday 25th October 2013. I would not recommend this place.When we arrived, the restaurant was busy, but not packed. The staff were therefore attentive enough for the first 30 minutes of our time there but appallingly distant for the rest of the duration.Food... For what you get this place is overrated and over priced. We opted for a bone marrow starter which substituted actual marrow with an overwhelming amount of garlic. We also opted for a meat platter - which had minimum cuts of some of the cheapest meats for an outrageously inflated $28 price. Main courses - everyone opted for burgers which, in all fairness, were delicious. However, we also opted for a Wagyu steak which was nothing but fat. Overall - Food = 3/10. Incredibly overpriced and, with what you got for what you paid, completely disappointing. Drink... We opted to bring our own bottles considering the wine menu was less than appealing. At $30 per bottle for corkage we felt the steep price on BYO was a bit of a kick. The first bottle was attentively seen to by the staff, but by the second it was clear that they couldn't care less - with one of us having to ask (twice) for a glass. By the third it was blatantly obvious no one gave a *&Â£% because we had to go an pick up the bottle ourselves from a ledge and pour our own drinks. Despite still spending a couple of hundred bucks behind the bar - the service (and even the temperature of the alcohol) was luke warm. 1/10Service... Bad. Don't get me wrong, I know and I appreciate, that hospitality and service staff in Singapore get next to nothing in wages - so this element of my review comes with a heavy heart. I'm not rich. I'm not poor either. But when I go out and spend a few hundred dollars, I want to have a nice time. The staff were nice, friendly, and polite, but the night just seemed to be too much for them, and they seemed to forget about customer satisfaction. It was almost as if we didn't exist for a while. 3/10.Conclusion... Spend your money elsewhere. Although (most of) the food was tasty, it certainly was not worth the over inflated prices for a completely deflated experience

We stumbled across this little place after going looking for Napoleon Bar which seemed to lack character so we kept looking... and couldn't have made a better decision. We ordered the teres major share plate - beef fillet cooked beautifully and grilled lobster. It was a fantastic meal and i highly recommend. Only problem was that there wasn't more food! If you are big eaters like us order an extra side of fries :) Very reasonable price too - just over $120 for the food and a couple of drinks. Should be much higher up on the rankings

I have been here three or four times and have never been disappointed. The burgers are great - especially the blue cheese. Excellent pork chop. And the pigs ears, once you get past what they are, are devine. It is on the slightly more pricey side but definitely on the better quality side also. Very efficient staff

We heard about this restaurant from a magazine and decided to try it. It is famous for its lobsters: either the Slider (sandwich) it the Grill. Both were amazing but I think the grilled one was better. Staff was friendly and atmosphere was nice. I will not eat lobster elsewhere again
