Just one more great time from this wonderful friendly place. This time with my daughter for hallowin.
Even idian food here is the best in the corner.
Amazing.

This unassuming little bar and restaurant serves up the best butter chicken ever, open till super late with a huge selection of beer, wine and spirits, good prices for Singapore too. The staff are welcoming and friendly, a pleasant little place, highly recommended 👌🏻

Things have changed with a take over. New owner doesnt understand that the business was based on regulars like us. Tired of explaining it to him. Its his business now. No more old owner. No more the greeting at the doorstep. He has business to run elsewhere. So why should I visit this place. Though my opinion

We went looking for a pleasant and comfortable cafe for a meal and stumbled on the Countryside Cafe. The staff were welcoming and accommodating ensuring that our meal was presented and served well. The menu is extensive and caters for all possible traveller demands! The atmosphere is eclectic with Pop memorabilia and travellers' currency covering the walls. Recommended for the welcome and the food all at a reasonable price
5
Came here with my boyfriend and we fell in love. The owners are ANGELS and the food is absolutely AMAZING!! They are also open late for food and drinks (3am for drinks 2am for food) and it’s in a great location. Fabulous service, fabulous food. Highly recommend.

Ordered Fish n’ ChipCeacar saladDraft Heineken beerGot Rubbish Random Veggie with overflowing unknown salad sauce.Frozen Fries and FishBottle filled glass of beer. So disappointed
5
We went here twice during our stay in Singapore, last place open in little India and we wanted to stay out. Owner is a gent, chatted away to us, and berated another customer who was incredibly rude to my girlfriend. Great little spot, you meet locals as well as tourists, really good fun
5
the food was really good, specially the Pho chiken. Little bit or relax of all noisy neighbourhood. I will come back next time to try other food
5
Rooms are too small.Wifi is fine.Bedsheets have spots.Clean bedsheets should be given.Location is very good.Breakfast could be provided to make it a better stay.Toothpaste should be left in the room instead of calling for one.
5
A wonderful place for a beer, even late at night. When much of the rest of the area closes up, this place is still serving drinks and food. The staff is always very friendly and welcoming. Lovely outdoor seating along the street to watch the world pass by. Great prices and huge selection.
5
The Countryside Cafe is a rare find in chain restaurant obsessed Singapore. It has an unpretentious, laid back vibe, an extensive menu with very reasonable prices. Food is unfussy but good. My favourites are the boomerang burger and Kerala fish curry. The owners are very sweet and always take the time to chat with their patrons. Good coffee as well

This was one of the most unpleasant dining experiences I've had in a while. My wife and I ate hear the other night and it was truely awful.They brought the wrong food - I ordered a vegetable burger and they brought a vegetable sandwich.When this was pointed out to the manager (I didn't catch her name but she was a woman) I was told in an aggressive accent "I don't have time to talk to you about this - just eat it the food is good".Speaking of which the sandwich consisted or a few slices of cucumber and tomatoe in stale white bread.Our chicken and fried rice was equally low quality and tasted funny.Little India has so many good restaurants don't waste your money here
4
Stopped by this place while looking for somewhere to have dinner in Little india. We were greeted by the loveliest lady who I believe is the owner. Took us forever to choose a dish as the menu has more than ten pages. We had the wontons, green curry, butter chicken and a few drinks. Everything was absolutely wonderful and the service was great throughout the meal
5
Hello there! I'm tired of exploring relaxed and chilled out place to have Indian, western and Thai food in the neighbourhood, and and Countryside cafe didn't disappoint. Foods are cheap, Uncle and aunty who runs the cafe are homely and cheap drinks are festival. Try laksa, burgers and Tikka. Come back agai

We popped into the Countryside Cafe in Dunlop Street during our visit to Little India. It had been pouring with rain and we decided to stop for some food. We are SO glad that we did. The hospitality was fantastic. The lady who runs the restaurant (I think her name is Krishna) was very welcoming and she runs the most amazing place with draught beers and the best, freshest, home-cooked food you can imagine! We were the only people in there (it was early afternoon) but I would think it gets very busy in the evenings. We had been on a three week holiday in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore and it was our last day and I can honestly say it was the best meal I had during our whole visit - out of this world! Cannot recommend the food highly enough. Thank you Countryside Cafe for a brilliant time! Lynda and Mark (he left his Wales cap for you to hang up in the restaurant!). x

I was staying in the area and found this place through TA. After I did I came here every evening after checking out other places in the area. It's a cool place to chill and people watch, with a good atmosphere.If you are a traveler you can see the souvenirs around the place and the lady owner/manager had spent a lot of time in the UK in the past and was a great character. I only had a burger there which was very good and they do have a varied menu. What I found amazing is that they have 124 different beers available. One thing for sure I will go back there if ever in the area and already I recommend to friends
5
On a visit to little India we called in on our last day between rain showers for a quick bite to eat and it turned out to be the best meal we had in Singapore.Everything is cooked fresh and to order, just a pity it was our last day of the holiday as we would have definitely returned, the owner is really friendly and welcoming and spent a lot of time living in the UK.P.S please look after my ha
5
Came here to have a bit of snacks, had to stay a little longer to stay out of rain. Pretty cool place and quite relaxed.
5
We ducked in here for a drink then stayed to keep out of the rain, great selection of beers and ciders, Shree is really friendly, we will be back next time we're in Singapore
5
We have been coming here for years and we really enjoy the food and drinks on offer. It is a great little bar in the middle of India and worth a visit if you are in the area.
5
A delightful place with great food and a really warm reception. The owners will make you feel at home
4
We were staying in Little India so chose to eat at this Indian Restaurant just around the corner from the hotel. We were greeted by a pleasant lady who showed us to a table inside, (there are 2 tables outside) she then helped us to choose our meal from the menu. We chose a Chicken Tikka Masala and a Vegetable Kadai, one served with rice and the other with a paratha flatbread. We found the food very tasty and enjoyed our meal. The food cost S$24.50 for 2 people. A glass of draught Tiger cost S$6
5
Been there the first time as soon as me and my gf arrived in singapur, we got back every single night of our stay. The owners are welcoming friendly and super nice. The menu is complete of dishes from all over the world (and yes, the chef is able to prepare them all properly) and the list of beers is huge. It s a must-go in little india
4
Visited here during a walk around Little India. Very friendly owners with superb food at a great price.Very varied menu, they cater for all tastes.Also has a great beer selection from all around the world.Whether you want a snack or a meal try this restaurant when you are in the area
5
I've been to this cafe many times over with my husband. Our favourite courses are: british murgh tikka masala, goan fish curry, kadai paneer and pappadam/rice/naan. Many rounds of beer and lassi are added to the mix!friendly owners, great crowd, simple, tasty and unpretentious food
5
I had an excellent lunch here on my last stay. The food was excellent, piping hot and very tasty. They offer a large, varied menu at good prices. The owners were very friendly and spoke excellent English, they lived in London prior to coming to Singapore. The restaurant is clean and cosy and would be an excellent place for a group visit, couples or singles.
4
We really enjoyed having a few drinks here. It's a pity that we had just eaten at a place down the road as the choice in the Countryside Cafe looked a much better option. You will find a fantastic selection of beers to choose from and I'm sure that you will be made as welcome as we were. Great service from happy professional staff that provides a welcome place to spend time and enjoy your holiday.
5
Worth a visit just to meet SHREE, lovely warm lady who runs it. Lovely atmospheric cafe and incredible selection of beers.Great place to relax after a walk around hectic ,crazy little India.
4
Cold beer, competitively priced in an excellent location. Friendly staff always willing to help. What more could you want?
4
Loved it, lovely staff, cook & waitress (all in one). Inexpensive & good to watch the crowds go by. Just relax, have a beer & enjoy.
5
I really love this place.
The owner and staff are friendly and they have belgium beers.
I'll back again.
5
Definitely have a beer here :) !! The CountrySide Cafe. Friendly staff, location in Indian district, enjoy one of faces of Singapore.
5
An awesone hideout amidst the busy little india. Excellent food n beer. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Coming from a hospitality environment, i think this nice, cosy n simple restaurant caters to people from all walks.
4
Cheap Singapore place here 😄for backpacker or for small budget to Singapore...... you can visit the little india many place to go..
5
More than a simple restaurant, we found here a new family so much welcoming! The boss Krishna, his wife, cousins, and friends considered us like their friends since the first contact! We spent 3 days in the Hostel just next to this restaurant so we were here every nights... ;) Food is very good reasonnable, the ambiance is perfect! You can go there to eat or to have a drink, it's up to you.Krishna is so generous and a very interesting person who travelled a lot. Hope to come back in Singapoor to meet him again! Of course I recommend
5
A friend found this place many years ago, I kept going back whenever I can to escape the city and concrete jungle to immerse myself into another world.I love watching people walking by looking at this little cafe. Aunty Sri & her husband, the owners, are very friendly people. Makes you feel at home whenever they can.The food are great especially the ikan bilis (anchovies). Its a must have. How I wish it was my local bar..
5
We were first time visitors to Singapore. This place caught our eye while we were randomly walking around little India and we wanted to give it a try Trust me it was the best decision ever. From a large assortment of beer to some really authentic Indian food you get it all. On top of that the kindest and sweetest of owners manage the place themselves. Super sweet couple Do give it a try.. I was really searching for the 6 star button. Will def come back
5
We visited the Countryside Cafe whilst on our honeymoon in Singapore. The manager was so kind and welcoming. There was a great selection of beers and cider and the food was also really good. All round a nice place and nice relaxes atmosphere.
5
French onion soup capture my stomach, a must come back for the soup. Cozy decoration of the cafe. Not forgetting the friendly staff who recommend food on the menu when u cannot decide what to order as everything is so delicious !
5
It has that country feel to it. With over 100 different beers, some good choices of cocktail and some spicy indian food, its a must visit place. My buddies usually meet up here, have a drink or two, chat with the nice friendly owners and enjoy good times. Dont forget to add your currency on their wall. Must visit for people who like a laid back atmosphere without any nonsense like sleaze. Perfect for families to have a get together
5
Nice Indian foods, milk tea and lots of choices for beers. The restaurant's owners are a lovely couple, they're very friendly and sweet. After I back to hotel I found I left my watch on the table. When I called them, they told me "You lost your watch here! Don't worry, we keep it safe for you". That's so sweet and I am highly appreciate it! It's a restaurant I want to visit again and want to recommend it to people who plan to enjoy wine and dine in Singapore's little India.Highly recommend! It takes around 10 minutes walk from MRT station. There are some hotels and hostels nearby. 很建議造訪新加坡的朋友去這裡用餐，老闆和老闆娘都很好客，聽他們說了很多旅行的事情。餐廳的印度食物都是現做的，食物的口感非常好。喜歡啤酒的話，他們供應來自世界各地的啤酒。也提供印度正宗的拉茶。另外發生了一個小插曲。我回到飯店才想起來，我把手錶忘在餐桌上。打電話回餐廳時，老闆娘貼心的告訴我，幫我把手錶妥善的收好了。 真的非常的感動與感謝。很希望下回到新加坡的時候，再次造訪這家可愛的餐廳

I stopped here for a weekday evening dinner. Wasn't sure at first, since I'd come to Little India for a curry, and this place looked a bit too Western. But reassured by the Indian owners, I gave it a go, and it was well worthwhile. There are two pages of curry menu, the first page is a bit average-looking but the second has a whole page of the same curry made from chicken, mutton, paneer, prawns etc. (it had a name like korai, which wasn't a korai, but then when it came it tasted like a korai) I figured this one one they were good at, and I wasn't wrong. I washed it down with Tiger but they have 100s of foreign bottled beers to choose from as well. Quaint, quiet sort of place, but very pleasant
5
Stopped in for lunch and a beer and ended up staying all afternoon. Very cosy surroundings, clean, great local decorations with a wonderful selection of beers, food was well priced and very tasty. The owner sat, chatted with us and gave us great advice for places to visit whilst on our visit to Singapore. Great place to eat, drink and enjoy Little India :-
5
I chose it because it was clean, cozy and cheap. Food was very good. I was alone eating on the small terrace when the owner sat down and start talking to me. I enjoyed the meal even more. By the way, he loves beers and he has from all over the world! get a chance to go there and talk this very open-minded man :)
5
You can try over 100 different beers, the owner will help you choose with his great experience and expertise. Great place for not only Indian food but also other cousin. The lady can help you in food selection and the owner on your liquor. The good part is they do not insist their opinion. I would say if you are anywhere near little India visit here
5
I am amazed by the aunty owner reports off previous visitors,these people were obviously talking about another place,the owners and workforce were charming advising us on what to order to suit our tastes food delicious beer cold nice price definitely ignore the idiots that put malicious nonesense and go and test it for yourself RECOMMEND DEFINATEL
5
The hosts Krishna and Shree are the most welcoming and friendly you can imagine. Its a great non-pretentious place to have a drink at the end of the day and a chat. The menu is extensive and we are always amazed how the chef manages to pump out those meals from the kitchen. I would recommend the Indian dishes personally. Yum! On our last visit Krishna was away unwell and we wish him a speedy recovery, we will just have to come back again
1
Avoid Aunty owner at all cost. Horrible customer service. She is shouting all the time at the customers and is too old to learn how to talk.
5
Great food, very friendly staff. Also not expensive and nice location. Try the Indian food. What should I add more to reach 100 characters ;)
5
Just go there to have a drink and a talk with the boss and staffs there=) They are very friendly. I went everyday during my trip in Singapore. And I also found some travellers there that I met the day before...lol
1
I like to come to this place with friends because this place has great food and drinks and the staff is very friendly.Hhowever the owner lady has not learnt anything in customer service and spoils the mood of the evening.Today on politely enquiring about the status of our order, she just lost her cool and started shouting saying that her kitchen is small and cannot cater to orders fast and she has got a big order and that is why cannot cater to any other order (this is 30 mins after ordering a dish of peanuts, which I would assume takes less than 5 mins to prepare).Avoid when the lady owner is at the restaurant
5
We wanted to go to little India in the hope that we would find a nice restaurant that served a decent Indian home cooked meal. After walking around for a good half hour or so and we had all but given up hope when we walked past this quaint little rustic cafe. After viewing the menu and seeing a few people eating there we decided to give it a go. Well what can I say, the owner was just a delight and made us very welcome indeed. I had the mutton curry and my wife had the vegetable korma. Absolutely perfect and it was just what we wanted from a rustic cafe. Washed down with an Indian beer we left totally satisfied. If you are in the area you must give this cafe a go. You won't be disappointed.
4
Of course, if you like the clubs and noise and shouting above the music and stress, then this place is probably not for you.For me, it's a great little place, with a host & hostess who take pride in their establishment.I got a little bit of Krishna and Shree's (excuse spelling) story, and it just tell's you the people they are. A professional couple who've live around (bits of) the world and who run their own bar now because they want to, not because they have to.I'm not especially chatty, but the customers at the countryside, were people who'd discovered the bar & just kept coming back.PR's claim to fame was that after 2 weeks, he'd managed to taste 50 of the available 100+ beers, and kept coming back, rather than to the high-life bars in the area.It's not fine dining, but it caters to many tastes, from finger food snacks (with a beer or two) to full meals, but my favourite tinight was the masala King prawns. Now I know why prawn aficionados <--(spell checked by Trip advisor) suck the heads of prawns.OK, I've gone on a bit, but i will be back there on wednesday, before my flight home :-
5
We are 5, staying on Penang Road, and decided to visit Little India for dinner. I checked Trip Advisor and The Countryside cafe looked like a recommended dinner spot. This is a fantastic restaurant in a vibrant area. Great menu and food and really good drinks card. Staff were friendly and attentive and we thought the meal was one of the best we have had in Singapore. Well worth a visit
5
We were staying in little India for a week, we spent a number of evenings at the countryside cafe. The owners and staff are fantastic,they are friendly and knoweledgable, they really looked after us. They have an extensive beer list, they also have a large menu of meals and snacks.they have a lot of repeat customers while we were there and are popular with tourists and locals. I would definately recommend them for drinks or dinner
5
Little India was our first stop on the hop on hop off bus, wandering through we saw countryside cafe open and decided to stop for a drink, on seeong the beer list wr could of stayed all day.Staff were super friendly and chatty but not imposing, would definately go back and recommend
2
I decided to drop by since discounts are offered to those boarding at Footprints Hostel.The Masala Tea was decent. However, I waited a whole hour just for finger food... One hour!It wasn't worth it either. Rather dry
5
We went to this place by chance, blessing in disguise... Simply superb food, very friendly staff... Happy to have met the owners... Nice people.. If u are in little India don't miss eating here.., best time to go in the evening....
5
Stopped in here for lunch after exploring the Little India area. The staff were very welcoming and friendly, and the chicken masala was delicious!
5
Small and cozy cafe, with an atmosphere. Good selection of Indian food and ciders. Free WiFi. Clearly one of my favorites in that area.
4
Just around the corner from Footprints Hostel or Prince of Wales hostel etc easy distance from Bugis or Little India MRTGood points:- friendly staff, great service- tastey food- great mango lassi - free wifi - excellent location for browsing shops/little India and the MRTDown sides:- not the cheapest in the area (not big portions for same money as China town for example) but good and filling- limited seating - was too busy in day time but returned in the evening and no waiting for table or foodI enjoyed my meal here but kept it simple so not to rack up a big bill. For those seeking the Singapore Sling it's $18 here, a lot cheaper than a lot of the other areas!

Little Did I Know How Much Fun I Was Going To Have In "Little India" Singapore When I Stayed There For 2 Nights On My Visa Run. Met And Hung Out With Krishna,The Owner Of Countryside Cafe. A real Gentleman and Host to all that visit his Countryside Cafe. I planned on going to see some different places in Singapore but it was so much fun hanging out at this cool funky little Cafe & Bar I didn't need to wonder off to another location
5
Its on Dunlop street and very near to Sandpiper Hotel. The café is open usually from 10am to 2am and it serves very good food and drink options. the café is not very specious but the heart of its management- they are very friendly. we had opportunity to have breakfast there and we just loved it....complete more than value for money, taste of food is bonus.
4
We stumbled across this little place today - Friday March 27th. The setting is nice and quaint, and the menu is varied. Food was great value, although drink here is a bit more expensive. We ordered the Beef Garlic Burn and a pepperoni pizza. Both were very tasty. The pizza was as stated on the menu - 7 inch and the Beef dish was a nice average size. Our total bill was just under 25 SGD for the two dishes and two cokes. it was nice and relaxing with friendly staff
5
We visited with friends and had been told that this was a great place for a relaxing beer and good food and a friendly host, Kris, couldn't agree more! It's cosy, authentic, right in the middle of Little India and has a character of it's own , so worth a visit 
5
Wandering around Little India we suddenly found the very small backpacking area and this little gem . Owner and staff very friendly very much a home from home . We stopped for a quick beer and ended up having a couple of drinks plus curries . Food was very good and cheap On our next visit to Singapore we will will retur
5
Love this place... Was traveling for work so not a lot of time to explore, stumbled on this place and stayed most the night then came back (after work) the next day. Owners treated me like a regular, aka family, great Bloody Mary's!! The food menu has a lot of items, I mistakenly thought that since they made such good mixed drinks that the food couldn't poosibly be good... I was wrong, the food was excellent, I was shocked, it already seemed to good to be true then to top it off the food was outstanding. If/when I mek it back to Singapore I heade straight from the airport to this cool place...
5
Great place, lots of different kinds of food. Food was really good and the staff was friendly. I recommend this place!!
5
We always stay in Little India when we come to Singapore, and this cafe is the only place near us that served western breakfast. The owners are lovely, the cafe itself is beautiful and has a very nice atmosphere.
4
I aways go here for either lunch or a drink when I am in Singapore. The food is OK - not brilliant - but always tasty and the atmosphere is nice. The owners are very pleasant.
4
Awesome service, great food for all....a little bit of everything....burgers, pizza, pasta, Indian, you name it then you can have it here. Great prices and a list of beers 2 pages long. Thanks for a great meal and chat!
2
Way over rated, portions are very small. The beer selection is long, thus lends to most sitting around and becoming stale. Had the butter chicken, which was good, but had bones.
5
Happened upon the countryside cafe by chance and it was a great find .... Great curry and a wonderfully welcoming and charming couple. Would definitely come back again.
4
the last of march 2014 i gon to Singapore,for 3 month,to works.I was spended many night at the countryside cafe,i'm really enjoy and sorprise regarding the first time to order the meal.the staff is very friendly. The food,especially the thay food is very Amazing!!!!and a lot of different choice of cocktails.thanks to all Stefano from Italy
2
This is a nice establishment, great street view, good chairs and good price beer...but every time I bought a beer I had to ask the proprietor for my change. Hope he reads this and takes the feedback onboard.
2
We came here today, tempted by "4.5 star TripAdvisor rating for 2014". What we didn't take into account is this rating was done when there was 40 votes or so.I ordered cider and spring rolls, my friend went for coke and fried wings. While drinks were OK (hard to mess it up, after all), my springrolls were a bit cold (hot on outside, cold inside -- pre-frozen?). But it was nothing compared to what my friend got -- cold chicken wings! I'm talking "scorching hot on outside, still frozen on inside"! That's clearly a health risk, especially that was chicken.When we asked the lady to fix it, we were abashed by her response. Instead of saying "oh, sorry, we'll fix it right away, that won't ever happen again" what did she do? She frowned at us, said "we always serve it like this!" and reluctantly took the chicken platter inside. When she came back with it after few minutes, yes, it was hot and properly cooked inside. But she didn't apologize, she didn't offer any discount or anything like that. We just left.Very poor place. And they abuse TripAdvisor rating (trying to get more customers).Avoid
2
The butter chicken came in a small piece that was fun-sized. The taste is average. I've had much better in Indian restaurants in the area.The sour lassi I ordered was inedible. My partner's mango lassi was slightly better. We didn't order any alcohol even though beer would have been good with beer because the alcohol is crazily overpriced here. This place seems to target gullible western backpackers around the area. Although it looks cheap due to its cheap decor, it is not
5
Here is my favorite cafe... Staffs are very friendly... Environment is wonderful. ..I offer this place everyone...
4
Everything okay, nice service & great food :) the owner are so nice!! we will surely come again. Its easy to find the little cafe.
5
Fantastic and really friendly owner, great food! Make sure to visit it at night! Perhaps the nicest place in Little India!
2
Went for breakfast. Only the owner was there so she was tragically under staffed. Eventually my coffee latte order came out sadly with spoiled milk. It was obvious this was going to be a fail so we asked to pay. Even that was too hard soni left 5 dollars on the table and legged it. I really dont recommend this place for breakfast
4
this small place in the hart of Little India is full of characters and with a lovely owner. We had a late lunch in there and I choose a deliciouse butter chicken! They have original glasses for the water...might sound silly but I love non traditional glasses Absolutely raccomanded! Ah, and if you are bored u will find the paper and cards on your table to intratain u
4
We had a meal and drinks here. Food was not bad and reasonably priced and we took advantage of happy hour to buy cheaper beers. Staff and management were friendly and I ended up drinking several international beers as recommended by the owner.Beer is expensive but not more so than other bars in the are
5
Tucked in under a canopy on busy Dunlop street; look out for this little gem so you don't miss it if you are staying in Little India. We had a breakfast and dinner at The Countryside Cafe as well as visiting for a few beers and a complimentary wine tasting at night during our stay in Singapore. The menu for both breakfast and dinner is extensive and good value; including Indian, Thai and Western dishes. The owners Krishna and Shree are so genuinely friendly, helpful, welcoming and open with all their guests. I have no idea how a previous reviewer can accuse Krishna of being racist; we got to know him as one of the most open-minded, welcoming and accepting people, who doesn't deserve such a horrible accusation.. At night, this cosy cafe is a buzzing meeting point for travellers and locals alike and the atmosphere is great! I highly recommend a visit to The Countryside Cafe
5
The Countryside Cafe was our favourite place in Singapore for enjoying a few beers and having a good time! The owners are great, open-minded, friendly, lovely and we just wish them the best! If we ever come back to Singapore, we'll come back to Countryside CafÃ©!
1
Owner is racist, rude and greedy. Boycott the place. I ordered a beer while waiting for someone I had a meeting with and had called friends over to join me later. During the meeting I had no drinks as we were discussing work. Owner suddenly comes from home and assumes we are sitting without orders and rudely says keep ordering (after my clarifying that I already did and will do later) or leave
5
We were staying in Little India and ate here on our first night. Walked past it a couple of times as it's name was partially obscured by their canopy! Well worth the perseverance however. Our host and hostess made us very welcome and their curries were tasty and delicate in flavour. We were persuaded to try their "Ghobi Manchurian", as an additional choice, a fusion dish encompassing Chinese and Indian flavours with cauliflower as the main ingredient. Scrumptious! Portions were not large, but in fact exactly right - we neither struggled to finish nor left food on our plates as is often the case with Indian restaurants. And at S$60 for 3 courses with rice and chapatis + 2 large beers very reasonable value
5
Went for lunch there, lots of variety to choose from at an affordable price. The owner was very friendly and the food was very tasty. Highly recommended.
5
Cheap beer ($3.50 pint), great range of Indian food, reasonably priced, friendly husband and wife family business. Well worth a visit.
4
The food was nice and the owner was really pleasant! We enjoyed playing cards while waiting for our meals
4
very very nice place, Thank you Krissna and your wife as well for good hospitality then I will be back again 3rd in SIN

We returned here in January after visiting for the first time nearly 3 years ago. Then we had just arrived in Singapore in the early hours and after checking in at our hotel we were in the need for food. We went to the 1st restaurant open for breakfast and that was The Countryside Café, where we were met by the smiling Shree. The food was great and we returned in the evening for a drink ( good value compared to other restaurants). We were so impressed with the service and food we visited again this January. Still the same warm welcome and great service from Shree and Krishna. Plenty of choice on the menu(not just Indian). The sandwiches being very nice. With a great choice of bottled beers to choose from this makes a must visit
5
The owners are lovely people, very much a passion business and this shows in the service, cool traveller atmosphere and really tasty food. Butter chicken was yummy, make sure you ask for boneless chicken if your not into that sort of thing, traditional Indian dishes are also really yummy! Good value as prices include drink and side and no service charge. 2 people ate like kings for $1
5
Looking for cold beer and good food this is the place .. has a warm and cosy atmosphere the place is ran my an elderly couple who remembers everybody which is awesome. i go there for the burger the swiss mushroom burger are great the portioning is not stingy and the price is very reasonable if u going to pop $80 u may have fed 6 grown man to the max.more interestingly this place is smack in the middle or rowdy bars. every fri n sat night u can have a free show of rowdy arguments and fights from the safety of the restaurant
4
I first visited the Countryside Cafe with some newfound drinking buddies one night after last call at the Prince of Wales Hostel. The beers (of which there's a great selection) weren't bad compared to some of the prices you see in Singapore - especially for somewhere that let's you drink until at least 4am! We also got chatting with the owner, who's a really friendly guy who loves sharing and chatting with backpackers, as you can see from the collection of photos and foreign banknotes guests have donated towards decorating the walls.On the advice of one of my fellow drunks, an expat who lived in the area, I came back the following evening for a meal with a friend. It says a lot about the place that, even though it's aimed at backpackers and the food is a mix of Indian and Western, the quality is so good that many of the locals will also eat here happily. I can certainly recommend the buttered chicken curry

This was our favourite restaurant in Singapore, in 3 days we went there twice!Food is excellent and not expensive, first time we tried hamburger, nuggets and chips (great with garlic herbs), but the second time we had to taste indian food because this is one of the best restaurants in Singapore and it was simply delicious. We were six of us so we could try many different dishes and share them. Some are spicy others not so much (so it's a good restaurant also if your stomach can't afford spicy food!).The basket with mixed naan bread was amazing, plain, garlic, butter or cheese, I loved them all.They have a huge selection of beers even if we opted for the local beer, Tiger.The owner is a very nice lady that we met just once, then she left for a few days and we were greeted by her husband Kris. He's indian, a great person, genuinely kind and gentle, always cheerful. With his sweet smile he made us feel at home. We hope to go to Singapore again to go to the Countryside café! Ciao Kris thank you!!

The Countryside Cafe has been around for 7 years and I can't believe we were lucky enough to stumble upon such a charming place. This place was 3 mins walk from where we were staying in Little India. Charles wanted a drink, so we went to the nearest place we could find. Beers were pretty cheap from SGD6 a glass. Backpackers and their regulars were seen enjoying a glass or two.Checked out the reviews on Tripadvisor and plenty of tourists loved hanging out at the cafe. Perhaps I should say, pub by night, breakfast bar by day. The owner mentioned that they are the only ones who serve western breakfast in Little India. Perhaps there were too many foreigners that the demand was there. Read more about my adventures in Singapore - http://wanderlustbyjane.blogspot.com
