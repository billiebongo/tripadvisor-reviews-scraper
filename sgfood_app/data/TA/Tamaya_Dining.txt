Came with a group of friends. Arrived at 6:45 and everyone's food did not arrive until 8:15. Service was incredibly slow and unresponsive. Food was mediocre at best. Pro: beer is cheap and friends were fun. Overall, a very poor experience. Avoid.

Excited at the prospect of Sashimi in Singapore, this was not the hoped for destination.
The buzz of cuppage road lured us in but the price was prohibitive.
A pleasant dining experience but a little underwhelming.

A rich experience with great ambience and service. Food could do with a bit more carefree approach for better taste.

This was the first time I went with Japanese visitors to a Japanese restaurants. Their selection of some great Sake made the evening memorable. The food was no longer as important, even though tapas-style appetisers kept coming to our table. Edamame beans, Tempura...

The food was not good and even the price for each and every thing was so highly priced that it became pathetic till the end

We explored the eateries in this precinct and decided on Japanese and hence the Tamaya.Service was ok and we were welcomed to an outside dining table. All ok.We were offered water of which we indicated tap water was fine. Not aware of being charged we opted for tap water. $5 per jug for tap water - outrageous RIP OFFTwo small salad appetisers (Otoshi) were brought out (weren't asked about them, they were offered, of which we thought was part of the table service). WRONG! $3 per bowl of which they put 2 out. Be warned of this little exploit!! RIP OFFOrdered a couple of different dishes and generally food was ok and tasty. But it was the surprise charges and response from the lady manager when questioning her about the Otoshi and water that leaves a bitter pill in the mouth.Prices - moderate to expensive Table service - okSurprise charges - UNACCEPTABLE and won't be back nor recommended! $5 for tap water is a rip off as was the Otoshi being offered as per of table service and then charging for it - Scam!Our customer experience was poor, hence the rating. Try elsewhere along Cuppage Road - there are better outlets available including cheaper noodle bars that offer better service a quarter of the price, and value your custom

Nice if simple alfresco location just off the shops of Orchard Road. Rich and varied menu. Portions are surprisingly small though - my Wagyu beef steak was literally 5 small cubes. Dessert also the tiniest ice cream ever. Sushi was ok at best. So all considered, food is alright but given the setting and casual service, price close to 100sgd per head was way too high
