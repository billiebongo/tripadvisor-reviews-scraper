Last night in Singapore but the view and the service there made it unforgettable ! Thanks to Venga the waiter and Saleem Shah the superviisor to treat me so well!
It worth the visit! Best regards from Brazil Adriana

I enjoyed the ambience and the food. But 75 dollars for one hour in-door golf is expensive! Service was good and the staff are helpful.

Listen, best advice I can give, pay $30, take a photo and head off somewhere else as quick as you can. House band lead singer was pretty damn good, sound system sucked, view - highest in town, but little atmosphere, snack food biasa, presentation worse, drinks, if you could get one, piss poor, service for a Thursday night when the rest of the town was pumping, non existent. Went there to check it out for my rapidly approaching birthday bash but would not expose good friends, or even enemies to a night at Altitude. Lots of better options in SIngapore. We've been there done that, & guarantee there will be no return business

Located on the top floor of one of the tallest building of Singapore. A local colleague insisted that we visit this place just to get the spectacular aerial view of SINGAPORE..and am glad we made it there. The excitement started right from the moment we got into the elevator as it took us almost few minutes to make it to the top floor..which justified the altitude! The place does justice to its name....you will be enthralled to get a glimpse of almost entire Singapore (or atleast to the extent that you can capture through your eyes) The music is nice aswell. Just make sure you visit this place when the weather is clear or else you would be confined inside the concrete structure which is a waste. And yes this place is expensive....but then Singapore is an expensive city

Came here during the afternoon before the F1 festivities, the rooftop bar had not opened yet so we decided to try this place out. This bar is all indoors and 2 levels down from the rooftop on the 61st floor. Still has great views of downtown Singapore and the Marina Bay Sands. This place is near the The Fullerton Hotel and only a couple minutes walk from Boat Quay. Good atmosphere and friendly service. Good place to come up for a quick drink, snap some pictures and enjoy the view

Came here on a Saturday night unplanned - the 61st floor bar '282' was open, but apparently not the 63rd floor (due to other reservations or weather I'm not sure).Staff were very welcoming even though I was just a solo tourist looking for a quick cocktail with a view at sunset. And a great view it is too!I came at about 6:00pm, basically to catch the sunset and have (groan!) a Singapore Sling. Well, I said I'm a tourist, right? Hint: if you get here and the window booths are reserved, the staff might let you sit there anyway if they aren't needed till later in the evening, so smile nicely to them!Having got a seat, and still feeling jelly-legged from the view as the lift ascends, I ordered a Singapore Sling. The bartender didn't show any disappointment, even though there are many special cocktails on the menu, and I'm sure it wasn't exactly the most challenging thing I could have asked for. No attitude, just chilled and friendly.Then, after the cocktail, I decided I was peckish after all and had some lamb meatballs, which hit the spot nicely with a Tiger beer. At the time, I got a nice view of the sea with all the lights of the ships waiting for the port, as the sky changed colour and then darkened at sunset.It's not cheap usually, but I think I got happy hour, so everything came together very nicely. In fact, with the view, and happy hour, maybe sunset is the best time to visit (I'm not such a night owl).Recommende

Took 200 colleagues here to celebrate a successful conference, but checked it out with locals first! The 70th floor roof garden has to be the place to start, with excellent Tapas and great views over the city. The buffet food we opted for in the restaurant was excellent and the service first class and I am told this is the norm. Thoroughly enjoyed the evening
