as you would expect when a place calls itself "wine universe", they have plenty of choice. The reason I especially like it is because they have many wines by the glass.

We went for the Sunday brunch. Food is great and consistent every time but most of all, amazing service that makes you feel at home.
5
Good food and wines consistently, good value for money, music and always welcoming! Good for people-watching too.

A buzzy after work drinks place with great wines and cigars. The staff are friendly and attentive and the ambience is laid back and relaxing. We only had some snacks which were good but the Millonario rum and havanas were superb. If you are staying in the Conrad this place is a few steps away and just what we wanted
5
Best service in town . Restaurant import some excellent cheese / cold cut from Switzerland . No compromise with food quality . Good wines menu with price a bit on the high side . Nice open area ideal for drink and cheese platter afterwork Definitely a place to recommend .

We enjoyed filet de perche, raclette and fondue (Vacherin/Gruyere cheese). All meals were very good and of high Swiss quality. Service was also very good. Thus, I recommend this restaurant for business and private purposes and will definitely come again. If the prices would be a bit less I would give an excellent rating immediately

I came here for some drinks with colleagues last week. I couldn't comment on the wine, but there's a good selection of beer here too. I stuck with the Belgian wheat beer which was really quite decent - and one I hadn't tried before. Service was efficient and friendly and the food was good too. Worth another visit
4
We went there for herbed cheese fondue. It was served with lots of bread cubes and baby potatoes, which was just way more than we expected. Compared to the authentic Swiss fondue I had before, this is really good and affordable especially since everything has to be imported. Only downside is that the restaurant is a bit warm so go later at night.
5
It's our first visit and we impressed by the level of service and patience of the staff when we were asking about items on the menu. We ordered the Fondue, racelette and t-bone steak. Loved that they thoughtful replenished our bread when finished the first basket. The fondue was a first for our kids and the staff were very understanding on the excitement. The fondue smelt of wine so the kids weren't too crazy over eating it. I would recommend the racelette for little kids instead. The T-bone steak came with 2 sides so we had salad and fries. This is a good size for 3 adults. but we shared it between 3 and 2. The wine universe team went out of their way to help us cook the steak a little longer so the kids can enjoy too.Happy hours end early so that's abit of a drag. Although the place has some air conditioning, be prepared to feel the heat still as the aircon is not cold enough and gets abit terrible indoors.Else, this is a lovely place for some fondue fun
3
Environment was open space concept with no aircon thus abit warm. Initiatially have problem locating it as restaurant was outside the building. Food was so so so salty.it would be good if they have more variety sets cos if wanted to choose fondue or rouchlette cheese ... Still need to order other sides to go with it. Service was only so so. Nothing much to talk about.
4
Very enjoyable evening I was extremely impressed the french fries which were really fresh and fried in excellent oil
5
Pleasant, great wines, yummy food & amazing service.
The staff was friendly and efficient. They could foresee we needed something before we even put our hands ups .
4
Another goodie, great service, an exceptional wine list and there snack platters are large and excellent value for money. It is a great place for a long meal or a quick stop for a glass or two. Enjoy.
4
Great music! Really friendly service and a very good wine list. A good spot for an after work drink with friends, easy and relaxed! Music was a winner!

The Wine Universe in Singapore is a fantastic gathering place for friends and collegues. Tucked in right across the drive from the Conrad, the Wine Universe is conveintly located to the Suntec complex.

My wife and I just love cheese fondue and we were surprised to find this gem. This place is not the easiest to find and it looks just like any other bars in the cbd. But walking in, sitting down and talking to the staffs there just gave us the expectation of "hmm this place feels authentic" and what happened in the next 2 hours just did not disappoint us at all.We ordered classic cheese fondue for 2-pax, and an additional plate of dry meet to go with the complementary roasted potatoes and crispy bread. We had a bottle of Rosé which 2 of us surprisingly finished.The fondue is very strong and rich, definitely a festive treat for fondue or cheese lovers.The dry meat doesn't taste the freshest, but it's for sure very fine in terms of both texture and flavour. And it goes so well with the Rosé.The Rosé was nice and smooth, it's the type that you can keep drinking and feeling better. It was also on 25% discount on Monday when we visited.At the end of the meal we had so much fine enjoying the cheese, meat and wine, that we decided to try the desert. The one we shared was called the "Red Devil" which was basically ice cream made from berries and mint, syrups and garnished with - Guess what - a shot of berry liquor, which was quite a refreshing "kick" after doing a large pot of cheese. Only thing that could improved is the temperature, it's a semi-open bar and it's a little hot especially when we were eating boiling cheese and drinking lots of wine.But I'd give full marks for the authentic cheese and the extraordinary dinning experience.

We arrived at the hotel after a long flight and were recommended by the Concierge to visit this restaurant when we said that we wanted a tasty, quick meal before we went for a long sleep!We loved the tapas like menu, which completely suited our needs on this occasion.We both chose prawns in chili and garlic with a delicious basket of chips. The bread that accompanied our meal was also delicious.The atmosphere was busy and very cosmopolitan, service was excellent.Next time we are in Singapore we shall return
4
We have been many times to Wine Universe.It's nicely located and have a nice covered terrace.We tried their Fondue - Nothing to say: their Cheeses and wines are excellent!They add swiss cheese in their burger and we can choose how we want the beef to be cooked so we can say that it's a good quality one. However their fries are really not good at all
2
Stopped by for a wine and some cheese. Started okay with our wine arriving in a timely manner. Our wine being a sparkling was served with quite small glasses and we ran dry quickly. We resorted to fetching our wine to refill it ourselves as we stayed dry for 10 mins which then prompted the serving staff to run over and refill us. The cheese arrived about half way through our bottle which was too slow. Below average service remained with our glasses running dry everytime. No excuses as the place was almost empty and we would have stayed longer if some attention was paid.
4
Came here twice in 24 hours mostly because it was a regular hang out for the friends I was with. There is a well stocked bar and service is good but that aside there aren't any special features or reasons to be here other than it is not crowded and you can carry on a decent conversation
4
Serve huge variety of food - Indian, Western and Asia. Food is delicious! I love their cheese! The waiters are friendly and provide good service. Idea place to chill out after work
5
Upscale wine centric bar/restaurant with indoor and outdoor tables. The rosti menu items are simple and delicious, satisfying meals. Wine by the glass choices offered wines at a much higher quality level than most Singapore restaurants.

While recently traveling on business and staying at the Conrad Centennial across the street, I enjoyed a lunch and a pre-flight meal at Wine Universe. The food was reasonably priced and very good on both occasions. The service, though, distinguished Wine Universe Restaurant as just great. The staff was friendly, accommodating, and highly attentive without ever approaching intrusive. Relax with a glass of wine from the extensive list, or a chilly draft beer and enjoy the day
5
We came here on a Saturday night with my 2 young kids. We.shared a fondue platter which was just fabulous. I used to live in Switzerland so was delighted to see some truly authentic items on the menu. The raclete also looks gooooodddd.Service was great, it was quiet on the weekend but was a really nice vibe. Great wines too. Nice family venue on the weekends and I imagine a good after work venue too.Price was great value for what we got. Thanks for a lovely evening wine universe
5
I visited Wine Universe 3 years ago and almost walked out the service, food and wine list was so poor. This establishment has been transformed in 3 years - superb service with knowledgeable edgy staff, sophisticated fusion food and a top wine list of Burgundies. The sommelier lives for wine and food and has a vast knowledge of wine. We visited twice in two days and will be back
4
Delicious cheese fondue and great family time. Service is excellent. The Swiss wine that comes with the fondue set is below expectation what makes the overall bill a bit on the high side for the value. Overall a very nice moment. Will definitely come back
5
I can find no fault in this place. The service is exceptional by being both relaxed and friendly along with being alert and efficient. The asparagus on promotion is superb as is the Fondue. Try the Swiss Pinot Noir , good value. If you are staying at the in the Suntec area this place is a mus
5
Very pleasant open air sheltered terrasse restaurant. Swiss management, hence also excellent Swiss wines on the wine list!At my friend's recommendation, I ordered a beef tartare. Best I have ever tasted! Prepared by hand in the kitchen (better not at the table, considering the hot temperature!), it was outstanding! Accompanied by a bottle of Humagne Blanc (alpine grape, found both in Switzerand and Italy). Yes, red would normally go best with meat but trust me, a fresh tartare with a chilled rare fruity but dry Humagne Blanc is a most festive light meal in hot and humid Singapore! I highly recommend the experience
5
We walked in one night to try it out. Surprisingly good food since it's primarily a bar. Great 80's music in the bar throughout dinner. Recommend the Wagyu beef cubes...so so good...we ordered two! Bruschetta was decent....pasta was good too. Great wine selection as well. Would definitely eat here again
5
My wife and I were closing out a business trip in Singapore, and wanted to celebrate! Found "Wine Universe" and we're blown away by the service and the wine and the food! Fabulous French Cuisine and wine, great atmosphere and staff! Kudos to Richard, great server
5
Great food, great service and affordable prices (fondue 25$++ per person, giant cold cuts platter (enough for 2 persons) 55$++, ...). Guess it's the perfect match ! Like the setting and the ambiance too. I definitely recommend this place !
5
Wonderful ambiance. We went here each night after the F1 practice, qualifying and race on the way back to our hotel. Wonderful wine and really great service.
4
Good place to hang out in the evening. Have a great selection of wine and other liquors. Also offers good spread of bar food and mains for dinner. Nice and friendly service staff. Regular hand out for me in Singapore.

I was looking looking for a good - but unique - European restaurant for dinner. Wine Universe obviously got my attention and actually the Restaurant name is pretty relevant here. I was delighted to see their large list of wines, although choosing one was not easy, so we asked for a recommendation and decided to take a Riesling Grand Cru to accompany the fondue. Half gruyère, half vacherin: delicious. The first time that I was able to find these kinds of Swiss cheeses in Singapore, it's pretty unique. I will definitely come back with my colleagues to try the wine bar. If you like cheese and wine, this is a not-to-miss
2
Almost empty at lunchtime therefore no atmosphere.Seated at a table that was not as clean as I would have liked.Took too long for waitress to take our order despite their being so few customers.Steak sandwich was delicious.Warning: service is charged but then when paying by credit card they ask you to add service again
4
The food, atmosphere and service were great. However it sits somewhere between a great romantic dinner and a watering hole for rich drinkers after work. If you can blend the two and eat at the back of the restaurant area you will have a great meal. If you just want a classy joint to drink with your friends sit at the other end and enjoy the DJ
5
I have reviewed this restaurant twice before, first one was favourable the second was not. However we decided to give it a go on this trip to Singapore. We are so glad we did. We ordered the T-bone steak for 2 sharing. The price was 58 sgd (not per person, this was for both of us) which included vegetables and fries or potatoes (very reasonable, especially for Singapore). My husband likes his steak medium, I like mine well done so we thought this would cause a problem for the chef. The steak was cooked to perfection for both of us, really delicious and plenty of meat. Maya (I hope I am spelling her name correctly) was our waitress and she was so friendly, so polite and so professional. There was also a French guy serving us also, he cut the meat and served it to each of us, he was also great. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone, we had a great night

this restaurant- wine bar- tapas place is on street level of the mall adjoining the pan Pacific Hotel.Looking for somewhere to eat we stumbled upon it, browesed the menu and chouse 4 tapas dishes and a bottle of wine. We should have only had 3 dishes as we were stuffed full of very tasty snacks. In UK terms it was - for the quantity & taste NOT expensive although the wine as a bit on the high side
3
There on Monday for a meetup with colleagues and ex-colleagues. Ordered 2 bottles of wine and overall feel that it's slightly more expensive than Wine Connection. Many of us had the business set with the Foie Gras and the Kurobuta Pork. The Foie Gras was nice (but how do you ruin a Foie Gras?) but the Kurobuta Pork was bland and rather dry. My sweet tooth required me to order the Profiteroles which was very good - with a good crisp to the pastry and sweet fullness of the ice cream. Ambience and Service was really good though so at roughly $80 per head, that might be what you pay for
5
I was heading back from the Suntec center to the Marine Mandarin hotel and I stumbled upon this great little place. The ambiance was terrific and the food was very good., They had a nice selection of wines by the glass and the food was very good. Definitely worth a try next time you are in the neighborhood
4
We went for a drink or two (or three), the atmosphere was good and the staff friendly. It was busy but that added to the ambiance. Alcohol is expensive everywhere in Singapore.
5
This restaurant is perfectly located in central Singapore. The wine selection is superb - with Super Tuscans and even Swiss Pinot Noir on the menu. Food is light and very enjoyable. The staff are all exceptionally attentive, professional and of course friendly. During my most recent visit, we were treated to fantastic background music from their selected DJ. The owners were also kind enough to introduce themselves and ensure that guests were enjoying the wine, food and service. Definitely worth a visit
3
This was our second visit because our first was a great success. Unfortunately it will be our last. The food was good but the staff were too intrusive. My husband went to lift our ice bucket and wine closer to us as we do not like to have our wine continually topped up. We were asked why we wanted to do it and then they said that 'no' they would pour our wine for us and lifted the wine back over to the bar. This is just one example but we didn't feel comfortable, which is a shame
5
My husband and I went to this restaurant last night for dinner. We are so glad we chose this restaurant. The staff were great and the food was beautiful. We had the set dinner, which is amazing value and included a lovely oxtail soup for starters, salad, bread etc. then we had T-bone steak with a choice of potatoes or French fries and a choice of sauces. The meat was delicious. We also had a bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon which was reasonably priced also.We will definitely be back next time we are in Singapore. Totally recommend it
4
my wife and i had a very good experience in the restaurant, the service was great for the waiter Hasrul (very kind and good recomendations), then the owner wife (the big boss) comes ot our table to ask for the service and the food, her name is Hod Dizeveu... she was taken care about every detal, the DJ was great Victor Shaqur.... we recomend this restautante and the ambiance .... congratulation
5
We stopped here on the way home for some wine and snacks, and ended up staying much longer because the atmosphere was fun without being loud. The music, great service and friendly staff made us stay mush longer than anticipated. I highly recommend this wonderful spot

We'd had a busy day and were walking back to our hotel - hot and with sore feet - when we chanced on this place near the entrance to the mall we'd walked through. We decided to stop for a drink - wine for me - and enjoyed it so much that we stayed for a little more - a serving of ice-cream for hubby and a coffee for me. So, we didn't really try their food, but we loved the ambience, what we did have to eat/drink, and best of all the friendly, welcoming service. For example, I couldn't choose between two wines - I was only buying by the glass - so they brought me decent tastes of two of them. When I chose one, he got a fresh glass for the one I chose and left the two samples for us. Little touches like that make you want to come back, and we would have if we'd been longer in Singapore.It was too hot to sit outside, so we sat in a little inside lounge area
4
Of course we are in Singapore and drinking alcohol so this place is expensive. However about the same as the other places in the area. We enjoyed a good night of fun and laughter whilst overlooking the flash cars go by next to us. What sets this apart is the service. The servers we had were French and trained sommeliers. And as only the French seem to be able to master, perfectly balanced service with a smile without feeling the need to intrude. They even ended the evening having a deserved drink with us (by which time we were tipsy to say the least...). Great service, if only there was a way to reduce the prices here in Singa
4
We were buying wine at associated wine retail outlet,during the process we were taken next door to taste a wine.We decided to come back that evening to eat there.It was a lovely experience with delightful staff.A Swiss based menu with a selection of rosti's that went very well with our steaks and veal.Happy to recommend for a good evening meal with a glass of win
5
I found this place a few years ago during my last visit to Singapore and hoped that it was still in business when I returned recently. It was and I was so happy to return. I was there on a Saturday night around 6:30 so it was pretty quiet (I was the only diner) so hopefully it gets much busier later in the evening. The atmosphere is modern wine bar, with some lounge chairs and low tables for drinks, and tables inside for more formal dining. Exposed pipes overhead, black walls and ceiling and an open kitchen add to the feel. The menu has lots of nice Swiss favourites like raclette and fondue and lots of wines from Germany and France.There are about a dozen wines by the glass total (red, white and sparkling) but for a wine bar I would have liked a lot more selections by the glass. The staff is also very knowledgeable about the wines and will let you have a taste if you aren't sure of your selection. I had a nice veal in mushroom sauce with Rosti and a salad with one of the nicest vinaigrette dressings I have ever tasted, in fact overall it was one of the nicest meals I had in Singapore all week. I felt coming out that the price was good value for the meal and wine that I had and I will be back
