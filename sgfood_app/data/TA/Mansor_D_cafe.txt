Rendang, ayam korma and fried chicken. All amazing. Super spicy but hits the spot. Small hole in the wall but so worth the travel down to town. Value for money and always a queue. Consistent quality.

Went to Mansor for lunch. The pony tailed owner was very friendly. His wife is the main cook and she can really whipped out dishes that are simply delicious and flavorful.

@TheKuoKnowsA restaurant full of happy diners and a queue of people waiting at the door can sometimes be a sign of a good restaurant.In the case of Mansor D'Cafe it was.It certainly didn't disappoint with either its rustic charm or the quality of its food. It is very basic. But don't let that put you off. It's simple but effective.The Ayam Goreng was fragrant and crispy. The Achar pickles were some of the best in Singapore. The flavour had a definite old-world charm about it - very reminiscent of the way that Archar used to taste.The Rendang looked very tempting too. But it is possible to have too much of a good thing. So the Rendang will have to wait until my next visit

I am not a fan of spicy dishes but the food here is worth crying over! The lemak cili padi (chicken) and rendang (beef) is really really good! And, on my last visit, I discovered that their fried chicken is really tasty too. Psssst ... do beat the lunch crowd if you intend to visit them

Second visit to this cafe at Far East plaza. Love their curry and fried chicken. Generous servings with great chilli sauces and curry gravy. The owner is friendly and we had difficulty to choose amongst the many dishes available. Finally ended up with a plate of yummy delicious food. Place is normally quite full and is self service.

Really nice sambal belachan. Spicy but yet you want more. Beef rendang was great. Creamy but not too much. Kachang with ikan bilis was fantastic. Their Ayam goreng is also their specialty. Overall worth a visit though Encik is very irritating always asking for exact amount instead of providing change

I have heard many of my colleagues mentioned about this before. But I didn't believe that the foods are really authentic until I tried it on my own. They are really awesome!! The familiar taste of Indonesian rendang, curry, and spices brings back the homely feeling. I would recommend this place for those who are die hard indonesian foods fan

Its been quite a while since I last had Nasi Padang. Yesterday, I had a strong craving for nasi padang, and this stall has been on my mind for the past 2 months. I mentioned this to my colleague and he was also keen to try.Its located on the 4th floor of Far East Plaza, along corridor at the back of the building. I ordered the following:- Sambal Goreng: Tempeh, beancurd cut into cubes, sliced long beans stir fried with sambal. This is wetter than the usual sambal goring at other stalls, with a little gravy. Tasty and good. - Ayam Korma: Chicken cooked in yellow curry and chilli padi. Doesn’t look spicy, but the chilli padi gave the gravy a good kick. Perfect when eaten with the rice.- Brinjal: The brinjal is cut length-wise and simply blanched and lathered with chilli. Simply delightful.- Ikan Bilis with Petai: This caught my eye, as the I love petai, which is stink bean. The bright green beans mixed with the fried crispy ikan bilis were ‘da bomb’ and I enjoyed it thoroughly.It costs me $6.To sum up, it was a good meal and I liked everything that I ordered. My colleague commented that his fried chicken was good. I will order it next time when I am back again. Highly recommended

If you are looking for an authentic Malay meal in Orchard area, then look no further. Hidden in Far East Plaza is perhaps one of the last places you will ever dream of finding delicious and true traditional Nasi Padang. The beef, chicken and mutton curry is simply to die for. If you're someone who loves spicy stuff, take your meal with a dose of their sambal belacan. Is absolutely amazing
