Had dinner last night. Gastrosmiths did not disappoint. I had the set menu with sashimi salad and the cauliflower pasta. Both were very tasty. My sister had the same salad and the skirt steak. Affordable and delicious. More people need to discover this delightful place.

Having a quiet afternoon tea with hubs before attending All Saints Day mass. This outlet is within HomesToLife itself. Very helpful service staff, their menu even caters for dinner.

Great convenient lunch spot if you live in the east. Brunch menu till 3pm. Regular menu available too. Really good coffee & the raspberry crumble is a perfect accompaniment.

Located within a furniture store on the third floor of 112 mall, it has a pleasant relaxed vibe. I tried the seafood Mee Sua which was too spicy for me and rather oily although the soup was flavorful; angus beef tenderloin which was below average; and tofu which was dressed in a weird tasting sauce. Maybe I will return to try their signature Japanese beef rice.

It is like the canteen of IKEA: part of a modern furniture store on the 3rd floor of Katong I12. The food is a lot more sophisticated though. The dishes we really liked: tomato soup rich and creamy; the Wagyu steak seared to the right texture, juicy and tender; the seafood Mee Suan seductively spicy and inviting ... The food we find room to improve: the kiddy Mac & Cheese that my Daughter did not finish a bit too slushy; the ice cream french chocolate fondant sprinkled with sugar cornflakes? Gorgonzola just ice cream with bits of blue cheese ..

This bistro/gastro-cafe-restaurant boasts an imaginative menu, a welcome change from most of the offerings in the area. For anyone looking for a great snack, they serve a mean dirty chai and truffled egg roll. The croque/toastie style bread dishes are good too. The mac and cheese sounds intriguing, and I'll probably muscle up tummy space for it the next time round. Above all, this is a great place for catching up with friends, with its inviting, homey atmosphere (partly because it's nestled in an alcove of a furniture shop that's worth a jaunt), pleasant tables and seating, and always lovely people

Firstly, the menu read really well and drew us in. The furniture is sourced from the home design store that GastrosSmith shares a space with which I loved.Service was sub standard, we had to get our own menu's and chase someone around the place in order to get someone to take our order. The staff would not make eye contact and were not visible.Everyone else's food looked delicious, and those in the know seemed to stick to more Eastern side of the menu. But, we chose western dishes which were all soggy and tasted strange. If we go again, we will stay away from western dishe

Gastrosmiths was an original foodie gem hidden in Katong Shopping Centre a few years ago, but now in it's bright new space in i12 Katong it's even better. Don't expect subtle flavours or traditional dishes here - all the combinations are original and the flavours are rich and bold. Great for dinner, but also good for lunch or a snack and glass of wine after work - the aged cheddar grilled cheese toastie with red wine jam is a personal favourite

I hardly ever leave bad reviews. There are many cafes near this area. This place is horrible. First, there is weird service. I think they are the owners of the place. One guy told me to order at the counter while I heard and saw as pic posted below a lady taking orders while customers sit. The iced americano is diluted. The yuzu lemonade is syrup mainly. The sea-salt truffle fries is loaded with oil from deep fryer and when I asked the lady, she tells me it's the truffle oil (which I paid more for) and I am 100% sure- it is not truffle oil. It's cooking oil. Look at the oil laden on my fingers. They have no chilli sauce- and this is Singapore. The tart was nothing to shout about. Disappointed.
