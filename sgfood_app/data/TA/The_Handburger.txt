Discovered this place many years ago in the basement level of the mall and keep coming back. Nice seating and fast service. To try: duck confit burger and 'everything but the'

After 2.5 weeks of Vietnamese food, this was a welcome return to western food! good choice and value for money.

Burger was tasty and well presented. Quite a bit of waiting time for the burger to be ready. Onion rings were nicely battered and fried.

Some say this is the best in Singapore. Good burger but not sure I agree it's the best in town. A bit confusing because it shares space with another restaurant.

Their burgers are well presented but the taste is a little higher than average. However the service is above average

Very enjoyable experience. Very friendly and quick service. Food made exactly as was requested. Excellent taste and good deals. All in all a place I will definitely visit again!

Apart from Coco Loco of Anda Bohol and Burger from Army Navy in Manila, this will go to the best burgers I have eaten in my whole life.Not to greasy, fast service and a whole lot of positive points that are too many to mention

Been here a few times, not the best burger i've ever had but reasonably good. If we come for late lunch, we like to order sliders. Smaller burgers, just nice for the small tummy. If you dine in soup spoon union, where Handburger, Soup Spoon and Asian Broth are all in one place, you could have more varieties besides burgers, which is not a bad idea. We actually like that. I had blue cheese beef burger. Add on $3.90 for a side and a drink. If you add on another $3, you get half pint of Sapporo beer. Not a bad deal

The good stuff (in order of preference): NZ Pretzel Burger, Souper Breakfast, Pho. Coffee and hot chocolate were fantastic.. We had lots of it. My family have been here 6 times over the past couple of years and have been very happy with it. Pricing was decent for the quantity and quality. Horrific Croque Madame. Really really horrific. Cheese tasted like plastic, bread was soggy, sauce was.. WRONG. Please revisit the recipe...

This was my third visit to The Handburger in Singapore over the years. The new concept with "the soup spoon union" appears not to be working. Three different concepts being serviced by the one kitchen has resulted in a loss of focus. When placing our order we were told the burger would be cooked med-well. Both burgers ranged from pink to bright red upon being delivered to our table. On a positive note the staff returned them to the kitchen without fuss when I expressed my displeasure. However I will not be returning. A pity the other two visits were great

The lunch menu is really yummy. For $11 you select from the lunch menu, including your salad and fries and a drink. Value for money.

the service and food standards of this outlet is simply OUTSTANDING! order time to food delivery time well within acceptable 15mims range. food standards great and well worth the set pricing. will definitely revisit this place.

They have now joined with The Soup. 6 months ago they had a set menu for lunch that no longer was there. We enjoyed the pull pork menu burger. Now, they no longer have pull pork. We had the hamburger instead. The restaurant is always busy but service is quick. Glad that we visited and have the burger again

The Handburger is in a small food court called Union (comprising The Soup Spoon, The Handburger and Soup Broth Asia noodle bar) in the basement of Raffles City.They have their regular beef, lamb and chicken burgers and a Duck Confit burger. Curiosity got the better of me and I tried the Duck Confit Burger. It was interesting, different and not bad but I stick to my original theory that a good burger has to be beef. This one had a light orange sauce and orange segments, making it sweet to taste. It wasn't bad but if I go there again I'll have a beef burger. Someone at the next table was having one and it looked quite good.I also had a glass of Sapporo Draft beer

Here for lunch during one of the weekend. Ordered the standard hamburger and find it pretty average and really nothing to shout about. As for the price, prettie standard too but it seems to be more expensive to one of the better burger restaurant at Thomson

We went to The Handburger about eighteen months ago and had always determined to go back. Since we were last there, the format has changed and they are now part of a venture with two other outlets. Also, it's no longer waiter service; you order at the counter and then your food is brought to you. I'm not sure I like this arrangement quite as much- it feels a bit fast-foody rather than restaurant - but from a business viewpoint, I can see why they have adopted it. Anyway, the food is the same and that's the most important point!My husband chose The Works, which he liked apart from the fact that the fried egg somewhere in the middle of it wasn't cooked enough. I had the Portobello Mushroom, which was everything I remember and more - worthy of being considered way above your average vegetarian burger. We ordered the burgers as a part of a 'set', which means that they came with fries. I don't remember them being so good - dry, crisp and cooked with the potato skins on - amazing!!We also ordered the Naked Chocolate Milkshake - more a dessert than a shake - and it was outrageously chocolatey.I'm still not sure about the new set-up but you can't fault the food. It's not cheap but it is good value but be warned, they don't accept credit cards!You can be sure that we will visit again

Wow! Impressed with the service in such a crazy busy environment. Very cool that the servers can find you no matter where you sit down. I had the original sans bbq sauce (who does that?) and it was very good. The fries were just okay. My friend substituted a Caesar salad for the fries which she inhaled. Very glad I ate here on my visit

This restaurant is conveniently located in the Raffles City Mall underneath the Swissotel and Fairmont Singapore. It's right in the busy food court but it is way better than food court food. Had the original burger which was around $13 and $17 if you make it into a combo which will then come with fries. Lots of different burgers on the menu, cheeseburgers, lamb burgers, chicken and even veggie burgers. Something for everyone, plus they have drinks specials at night, buy one get 50% off your second. Good place to go for a fast, fresh and tasty burger

This is a good quality fast service casual restaurant located in the busy Raffles Place food court.They focus on burgers- in a myriad of permutations!Service is fast and friendly.The burgers are tasty. We had a serve of their chunky fries, which were served with a tasty chili sauce.Pricing is reasonable: SGD11 for a large burger- served on an impressive looking platter.The ambience is casual- you sit on benches within the food court.I recommend this place if you feel like a tasty burger- served remarkably quickly

One word amazing! Such a diverse restaurant to your typical hamburger restaurants. We had the original handburger $13 and the Happy Lamb Burger $17. Fantastic flavour. There are so many to choose from. They also offer 50% a second drink at night. We tried the peanut butter and banana shake! Words cannot describe how great it was. I will go again before we leave Singapore!
