Stumbled this hidden gem while staying nearby. Was walking aimlessly when I saw this Bali Nasi Lemak. Tried it and felt in love. The rice is fragrant and I like especially the fried fisj as it us super crispy and love the otak otak too.

Food is really good. Nasi Lemak is a must try. The food is cheap and has huge servings. What I just think is funny in SG is when you ask for napkins you have to pay additional for the napkins.
