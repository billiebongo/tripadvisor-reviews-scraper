On level two in the mall nice for quiet meet ups and gatherings for a conversation. Quality of coffees is very good also toasted sandwich very decent. Simple casual concept

The coffee at Commune is one of the best in the down town area and prices are comparable to those of other coffee places nearby. Seating is "outside" -outside of the shop, but under the roof of Millenia Walk, that is.

Been meaning to try this place for a while and finally had an opportunity this afternoon. The coffee was very good, with a nice little design in the milk froth. Efficient service. Worth another visit.

I had a meeting with a headhunter here and it was ideal. Very good coffee prepared quickly and a venue where we could here ourselves talk.

The coffee at this place is not bad and lattes are done decently. The staff are quite well-trained and our order was ready in less than a minute or two. Cake was okay, on the dry side, but that happens a lot with cafes. What I do like very much about this place is the location - the seating area is on the second floor, on two bridges that overlook the human traffic below - great for people watching. Unfortunately Millennia Walk doesn't have a lot of traffic to begin with. So if you're looking for a peaceful place to read and do some quiet activities, this is an excellent choice

This has become one of my preferred places for coffee in Singapore. Cappuccino served at the right temperature and the right strength with proper effort but into the art in the froth. Plenty of choice now in the Millenia Walk vicinity but this is still a very good option

The waffles topped with ice-cream taste great with a cuppa full-bred coffee set within an artistic rustic countryside household furniture and yesteryear collections in the annexed shopping complex of Singapore's 6-star hotel @ Suntec City.However, customer service staff is just average to be commended
