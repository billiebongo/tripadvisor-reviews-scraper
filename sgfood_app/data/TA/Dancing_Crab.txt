The food ordered was very delicious. Service was good as well. Will definitely be going back in future.
4
Zesty garlic with clam is super shiok! Also tried the signature sauce with prawn. Service was a bit slow perhaps bcos of the crowd.
3
Great food but the service can be improved. Waited 30min for the staff to bring out the birthday cake. Staff was getting impatient when we requested for utensils.
3
The waiters are fine and responsive. The young waitress is just clueless. Stand there day dreaming and don‚Äôt even pay attention to customers. If she don‚Äôt like waiting table she should not be there
4
Service was excellent!
We order the Live Crab Combo and were deliberating whether to go for the mild or spicy sauce. The waiter gladly offered us a tasting portion of the spicy sauce for my boy to try. üëè

Nice food experience. Price is a bit high. Services is not satisfied. Maybe staff not enough. Can improve the service level even staffs are not enough.

Food was fantastic! Especially the lobster roll & the dungeoness crab! Seafood were all very fresh! Must visit again & do purchase the chope vouchers for 10% off.
5
It's always nice to make reservation, even last minute ones, during dinner. We ordered the lobster set - they were big and juicy - and it came with prawns, corn, spicy sausages and lots of garlic with butter since that was what we ordered. We had to eat with hands. Of course you eat with hands when it comes to seafood. There's an area for you to wash your hands before and after eating, so it's pretty fuss free. Everyone is given a disposable apron so no worries about dirtying your nice blouse. But, I wouldn't know about bringing kids - unless they are well-behaved I assume they'd be tempted to play with the food. The seafood choices are okay but they are definitely fresh. There are other side menus and drinks choices. If I remember correctly, I don't seem to see alcohol on their menu - well, we ordered tea
5
This restaurant was one-of-a-kind. You can choose to have your mains in a pot, or poured onto the table (of course with a layer of waterproof paper). The food was superb. Recommend the Beurre Blanc sauce for those who can't take a single bit of spiciness. Service by staff was great and prompt. Highly recommended.
5
Not my first visit to this Dancing crab branch. Brought my family to dine there... approx $50-60/paxOrdered two styles of the Sri Lankan crab - mild spicy signature and the beurre blanc. My family enjoyed both styles. As usual a thumbs up to their lobster roll and truffle fries. The sweet potato fries were also surprisingly good!Especially enjoyed that they accommodated a birthday celebration with much fanfare! A fun dining experience overall
1
First time there but lots of food unavailable. Staff were not informed about the unavailability and had to check again
4
We ordered combo and lobster roll. The food served tasted fresh. Price is slightly on the high side.
4
i chose the lobster mix with corn and sausage. but the flavor i chose is tooo spicy for me.. lol... .
4
Went to OC Dancing Crab with my girl for late lunch. Ordered with Chope Voucher to enjoy a 10% discount. The staffs there are friendly and service was good. Has a happy and relaxing lunch there.
4
Excellent service but a la carte taste can be improved. Overall the combo taste is good. Price is affordable
4
Eating with your hands once in a while is a fun experience!
Food was delicious but a little tad spicy for me
Better value to order the combo
4
Second time here. Enjoyed my time here with my friend! We had the spicy miso sauce which was exclusively only at the orchard central branch. But I think i still prefer the signature sauce. Overall great experience.
4
Super fresh meaty dungeoness crab with Cajun spices were a first for me. The combo was just enough I guess, but for$150 id probably not return soon. Had the crab cakes too which was super meaty and satisfying: I guess with the combo it was enough for the 2 of us.Oh and don't overdo the spice level? We had mild spice (we are normal Singapore spice eaters) but our tummies all felt weird for the rest of the day
2
The meal was meant to be a birthday surprise and meal for one of my friends. Before entering the restaurant, we were chased by the Restaurant Manager for the attendance of our two other friends (birthday girl and her Boyfriend). Note that we arrived 15 minutes before the reservation time. Before we sat for even 5 minutes, the waitress came over to ask on our order. After another 10 minutes, we made our order after being chased, when our Birthday Girl just arrived, on time, 7pm. We waited for more than 1 hour for our food to arrive (only after we enquired about our order from 1 waitress to another, a total of 3, and finally the manager was notified). Apparently, our order was not keyed in at all. After chasing us for our order, nothing was keyed in. Not even our drinks or side ordered came and we were already getting super hungry. Food came at around 9pm. We only had maximum 45 minutes to dine, as the closing time was 10pm, and they were all cleaning up in the middle of our meal. The food was bad. Too salty and the portion was extremely small. No doubt our bill was discounted little. Fries and waffle ice cream (we didn‚Äôt order these) came to our table as ‚Äúon the house‚Äù, these weren‚Äôt what we wanted or looked for. It‚Äôs the dining experience. But it‚Äôs was all ruined from the beginning.
4
well, seems rather repetitive doing this as I go quite frequently. great again.I think the combos are better for 3 rather than 2 people. I have more of a complaint againt the Chope rating system which never seems to click on the rating I want
3
With Chope reservation, easily got a table and 10%off with voucher purchase through Chope. Pricey meal for 3 pax, total bill cost around $200.
5
Their lobster roll is the best of the best. Tender and juicy. Good service and excellent food. Will definitely come back again.
5
My multiple visit to Dancing Crab. The outlet at Orchard Central is my favourite so far. I loved the bag of seafood with a generous amount of garlic and the classic chilli sauce one is divine too. Great place for some licking good food!
4
Overall good food but a bit pricey, still will go back for celebrations with friends and family. Staff there were prompt too
5
Book your table from chope & you won't need to queue.
Good food & service.
I love the spicy flavour & the spicy miso butter.
5
The crab was delicious and staff who served us was very friendly. But the staffs didnt managed to inform us on the changing clams to prawn requires additional top up on it. But it still a nice experience.
4
Food was good, atmosphere was good, service was good, but really on the pricey side for the portions given.
5
It's a new experience where we could happy eat using hands freely without eye ball rolling from other customers. Service was good as the staff were friendly and could recommend dishes that suit my 2 children.
Just that the price is at the higher side.
5
Dancing crab never fails to impress us with fresh seafood and great sauce.
Mild spicy was much spicier than previous visits.
Recommend the zesty garlic butter!
4
Lunch Set A comes with a basket of 5 prawns+2 corns + half a sausage. The prawns were very fresh, definitely worth paying! Corn was sweet and sausage was average. Coleslaw taste good, sweet and fresh! Crab Garlic noodle could improve if there's more garlic and slightly oiler as the noodles were on the dry side. Also, if could increase the portion of the noodle would be perfect.Overall was a worth it lunch! Paid SGD17.65 per pax, will be back again
3
Even after reservation still have to wait for sit. Quite disappointed. Location at orchard central. They need to know reservation meaning.
3
Ordered a waffle the moment we sat down. When we finished all our food about 40mins later, the waffle wasnt ready.
5
Food was good , service was ok but the price abit too expensive, but still will visit again , recommended for friends and family gathering
5
We had lunch at dancing crab Orchard one afternoon and ordered the lobster rolls as well as the lemon sauce mussels. Very yummy food and reasonable priced for Singapore standards. Will return for sure :)
2
Gave us the wrong order. First person told us it‚Äôs on the house. Second person told us only the prawns were on the house. In the end we paid normal price as only the corns and sausages were waived.
3
Cajun seafood is yummy. I also tried the seafood gumbo which is rather disappointing - quite salty and lacks depth in terms of taste, overpriced for the quality and portion. Please do not order the lavender lemonade - way too much syrup and overpowering scent of lavender, felt like I was eating the essence oil
3
The food was generally not bad. I ordered the Baller combo, some parts was a lil too salty. Not sure if its suppose to be like this. The staff was friendly enough and quick especially when as the crowd was coming in.Just that one of my ordered was missed out. But after awhile it gets a lil sickening even though the portion looks small, but halfway through it we became really full. Overall, it was not bad
5
We really enjoyed our visit to Dancing Crab. The American flavour and experience was rather unexpected, but very enjoyable. Young people working here, service was outstanding. We had the black pepper crab with corn, can highly recommend. The crab was great, the corn excellent. Rather a nice Chilean Chardonnay went down well with it. Altogether was a lot of fun making a big but acceptable mess. Thanks guys and girls for making us Aussie visitors so welcome and feeding us so well
4
Fresh seafood .We ordered the chili crab , lobster combo, Dungeness crab combo , fish and chips and battered mushrooms . Be prepared to get your fingers messy and finger licking good. Good place for casual dining ,Not much food options for kids though.
4
We had a family dinner here and it was a unique dining experience for all of us. There were no utensils to use so we basically had a good time eating messy. Food was delicious but portions were quite small for the price you pay. Staff could also be more attentive. Overall, a great dining experience with Dancing Crab. :
4
Service was prompt while would prefer both orders to be served together. Packed weekend for this restaurant, so felt that service staff were rushing us to bill. They were polite and attentive nevertheless.
4
Super fresh seafood at a premium price~ Chicken & Waffle, Seafood Jambalaya & Crab Meat Fried Rice is good too!! =)
4
Food wise, the oyster was very nice. Tried the Chili and Garlic & Butter crab and combo, didn't really like it. Next time will try the cream sauce. Overall, I still recommend it
5
Food is really good but might be too much for 2 person if you're ordering the seafood bag. Service is good
3
Tried all the 4 different sauces. But I only like the signature sauce. The garlic butter is ok. The other 2 sauces type isn‚Äôt I would have ordered again.The fried rice with the crab was good too.Chicken wings n lobster roll not fantastic.Spent an average of 60 bucks. But didn‚Äôt feel full. Will come back for the seafood w the signature sauce
4
I have always loved seafood and the best way to saviour them is to use your hands. So naturally, dancing crabs is one of my favourite seafood joints. I hv been to both their outlets and i must say the ambience is much better at the turf club. However, the convenient location of Orchard Central is a big plus for me.
4
This the 5th time we eat at Dancing Crab as my Daughter just loved the crabs spread on the table while she uses her hand to eat all the stuff "thrown" on the table without mummy scolding her of being messy.... And she will lick her fingers especially with that cream sauce from the "Crab in the bag" and eat to her hearts content!! And good service too...
4
Their signature dish (Live Dungeness Combo) is superb where the meat is succulent, fresh and juicy combined which sauce that had the right amount of spice. Although the restaurant claimed that they don‚Äôt issue cutlery for the one of a kind experience, but who will use cutlery when having crabs & prawn. Music is too jarring for my liking and tables are too close to one another (privacy issue). Restaurant is severely short handed during peak period as it takes a while to fulfill guests‚Äô requests. No much issue with the price as we are having an assortment of seafoods but it could be cheaper by 10 to 20 dollars. This is a restaurant that I will go once a while.
3
Had to Queue even though reservation was made in 3 days before actual date.Food was served in time, however had to wave for 3 different staff on different timing because the checkout bill takes forever to be done. Waited about 30 minutes just to wait for them to return me my card
3
Made a reservation in advance. Even though it was a random weekday afternoon, the place was fairly crowded. Be warned that after ordering, you will need to wait around 20min for your food. Tried the black pepper crab combo and ordered additional sides - fried mushrooms and Truffle fries. Mushrooms were juicy and delicious! Truffles fries were normal and a bit too salty for us. Crabs were nice but could be spicier.Unlike most people I normally do not use both hands directly when eating crabs. I asked for a fork but was dismayed when I was only given a plastic fork which was useless for handling the crab. So eating the crab was way messier and less efficient than I was used to.
5
We just bought a simple small cake from Chateraise but when we asked the staff here to serve our cake, it turned out to an amazing birthday celebration where the staff decorated it and served it with liquid nitrogen!
4
Food is tasty. But does not feel full for the price paid. Reservations recommended for weekends. Chairs too close to each other. Location is in orchard so quite good after shopping. They have lunch menu.
4
Food is good but expensive. Wait is long too. Generally still not too bad will be back again for more
5
Chilli crab served is nice and fresh while the chilli sauce is excellent to eat with the bread! The price is reasonable for the dine in such great environment of the restaurant.
4
The seafood had special sauces to go with it that tasted special. The regular chili crab was just so so though.
3
The seafood was relatively fresh although it did take a while for the food to arrive. Overall, a decent place for seafood.
5
Came back the second time and had the crab combo. Food was tasty and well worth. Would definitely return again.
3
It is a supposed to be a Louisiana-Southern restaurant. The chicken waffle is good. Crispy and the waffle did not get soggy. Disappointed with the jambalaya that tasted more like fried rice and the gumbo would have been better if we could order a bigger bowl.
4
Despite the reservation, I still had to queue for another 15 min before a table was available. Furthermore, much of the food ran out on a Friday night. Given the crowd on weekends or Fri nights, I felt that the restaurant should have been more prepared. Some of my orders were missed out and the food never came. That being said, the standard of the seafood is still there and am happy with the quality
3
Quality of Service and Food dropped. No longer enjoyable. So many service staff but just standing around, very difficult to get the attention. not keen to serve as well. might as well have no service. Food quality is bad too. remember really tasty fresh seafood when it first open but it is dipping to a very low standard
4
Having fun with the kids messing up the dining tables. Flavorful crabs & seafood. good side dishes..
5
everytime I make a big mess of myself and the table but I think that's the point. :)
Happy to go again
4
Very fresh seafood for a premium price~ However, we found some non-seafood items in the menu which is affordable & tasty~ Chicken & Waffles!! =)
4
Ate at Dancing Crab with some friends. Yummy food. Enjoyed the Dungeness Crab combo very much, even if it was the unusual cream sauce.
4
I will come back again! Service there is great! Nice music also a great place to celebrate my monthsary!
4
Is was our first time to dancing crab, the staff was attentive and will explain clear to us what they have on menu. The chili crab was good.
3
Food served faster than we asked for, as we were waiting for a friend. Tastes is average, prefer other restaurants.
3
The menu of Damcing crab has changed fm the clipboard to the flip clear folder. But this is not it, the prices has changed too. Instead of the combo bag which cost $40+, the lowest price for the seafood combo bag is now $80+ as it includes a crab in it. As such, the cost for dining in this place has gone up. Guess, I will visit less often, as we find it cumbersome to eat crab and the cost has gone up by 50% for us when we visited.
3
Have been to this branch a couple of times, their crab combos & lobster rolls (changed the fries on the side to truffle fries) never fail to please. We gave the seafood pasta a shot this time and we're somewhat disappointed to find that the seafood was over cooked. The pasta in general was quite unremarkable & not worth the moneyI'd strongly recommend first time visits to the restaurant to try their combo bags or lobster rolls instead
3
Came here with my boyfriend because I was craving their crab cakes. Service was ok..can be quite slow during certain periods, maybe because they were preparing the restaurant for closing time as it was already almost 9pm. We ordered the corn chowder with crab, lobster rolls, fish and chips and crab cakes. Corn chowder was a bit too sweet for my boyfriend, but just nice for me. The generous chunks of crab in the soup was the winning point for me. They were also quite generous with the lobster meat for the lobster rolls, very fresh too! Boyfriend loved the lobster rolls. Fish and chips were texbook. Fresh fish, yummy tartare sauce, but what caught my tastebuds' attention was the pink dipping sauce, if I'm not wrong chipotle dipping sauce? Whatever it was, it came with the crab cakes too. Now the crab cakes were quite a disappointment. The last time I had them, they were immaculate, but this time they were just too oily for us. Probably oil wasn't hot enough when they put the crab cakes into the deep fryer/pan? Filling however was again, generous. It was stuffed with so much crab meat!! *drools* For drinks they had a $5 happy hour special for white bacardi rum. Boyfriend got bacardi rum w/ ginger ale and I got the Southern Sweet Tea. His drink was so good it perked him up for the rest of the night, mine however was nothing special at all. Tasted better the last time I was there. Not enough sweetness and tasted like normal Lipton Tea that I could've made at home with some ice and sugar. Overall experience was maybe not as good as my last, but still acceptable. I would still recommend this place to people for good seafood
4
Suggest to buy the voucher and save a little more for the food. The price is high. Food is good. Will come back for more!
5
I loveee to dine at dancing crab. The original sauce is soooo good that I always have the cravings for it! I enjoyed the dinner. Thank you
2
Service was horrible.
Food was average. Wouldn‚Äôt much recommend .
Some stuff were nice.
But 1 particular girl seem like as if she doesn‚Äôt want to serve.
Her attitude is horrible. I work in the service line as well.
But her attitude is unacceptable.
4
Food served fast, waiter was friendly. Third visit in the year, like the food offered here. Recommended and will visit again.
3
Total 5 of us taken dinner at there but all of us really feel that no worth to eat with that price..
5
The food and service were both excellent! The lobster rolls (comes with cajun fries) is a must try! Definitely worth a return visit
4
Overall it was a good experience. We made a reservation at 8pm but we were there at 7.15pm. Informed the staff's and he tried to arrange seatings for us. The food was satisfying. The only issues was there were probably a lack of staffs cause I only see 2 waitresses around on a Saturday night
3
Waited very long for our calamari and by the time it was served, we were very full so we had it took away.The other food were nice but calamari was super oily (the most oily one I ever had). Before we requested to take away, already can see the oil on it.
4
This is my third time repeat visit, the food was nice. I had visit others similar shop but their sauce is not as nice as what I expected. If you can eat spicy food, I will recommend you to choose their signature sauce with the combo bag. I love their signature sauce 
5
The dancing staffs were very efficient! Because we were stuck with the options on choosing which crab to go for, one of the staff recommended well and asked us to try the Dungeness Crab and it was AWESOME! They were prompt, knowledgeable and forever smiling! Well done
5
If you want to indulge in really good seafood with a twist, Dancing Crab is the place to go. Love the spicy miso nutter with the combo, garlic noodle, crab cakes, seafood gumbo(on occasion) and ices sweet tea to top it off.
5
Visited on a Friday night. It's better to make reservations as there will be Long queue. Great place for gathering and as we need to use our hands to eat, nobody are on gadgets hence maximise the quality time spent.
5
Good stuff! Came 2x wife n my bday. Nice place n convenient for wheelchair. Noisy n lively w ppl queueing without rsvp.
3
The food was amazing but the customer service wasn't quite as good. Perhaps we were placed in an area that was blinded but I am so sure some of them made eye contact with me !
1
very hard to catch the attention of the service staffs even though it was on a Monday evening, not a busy night.
under staffed issues and the the waiters were absent-minded.
4
Service of servers are excellent. Location is extremely convenient for both friends or family gathering.
However, it can get rather noisy during peak period. Nonetheless, this outlet is better than Vivocity which has little personal space in between tables.
5
the staff provided great suggestion and recommendation of food which it does value for money. However, dancing crab should think more about new way of cooking instead of sauces where we could taste the freshness of the seafood as I am a seafood lover
4
Waiters are attentive and tried to satisfy our requests as much as possible.
The food is ok, although there is limited choice for kids (e.g. lack of non-spicy, non-alcoholic choice).
3
We made a booking for 7pm and arrived earlier, staff had good service. The food was served really fast (5 mins after ordering) and usually that's a good thing but we suspect that all the seafood was precooked and just heated up again with the sauce we selected because the crab, prawn, shellfish were all overcooked. The sausage is also not nice as well. Overall, it is a disappointing dinning experience as the quality of the food had definitely dropped. For the price, you can get more quantity and quality at those neighborhood tze char stall
5
Brought my friend from Hong Kong to try Dancing Crab! Very happy with the food and the exclusive sauce only available at Orchard Central. Side dishes include the Garlic Noodles and Truffle Fries. Very silly of me to forget to redeem my $10 voucher. Gotta head back again..
5
Having dinner with my wife and we always enjoy eating there. It is a nice place to visit as there are a lot of combos to choose from.
3
The service was very slow. The staff are not well trained beside the manager. I feel there is a lot of room for improvement.
4
The service and atmosphere is good but the food is not up to what we have expected, abit disappointed.
4
Ordered the Sri Lankan Crab combo with Beurre Blanc sauce and everything in the bag was good. Seafood was fresh and the sauce was finger licking good. Definitely will return again.
4
We ordered the Sri Lanka Crab combo, an additional combo and 2 Sri Lanka crabs on promo. Perfect for 6 pax!
4
Despite the mess I make, I rather enjoy the experience of eating there. Highly recommend to those who don't mind getting their hands dirty.
3
taste was ok. crab was fresh but the mussels were tiny in the shell.. service was almost non existent. I went at 9pm and although the place was less than 30% filled, I stood at the entrance for almost 5mins before someone saw us and told another person to attend to us.you have to signal and catch the attention the staff for order, signal and catch their attention for basic utensils such as a crab shell cracker. in the end I went to the cashier to pay for the bill because I knew I had to signal and catch their attention again for the bill.price is ok, quality is barely above average but service is definitely missing right from the beginning
3
went to dancing crab for lunch with colleagues. we ordered the combo bag 1. as compared to what we had for our previous visits, the portion has shrunk and does not justify the $80 price tag. staff quite inflexible too. we ordered fish & chips but would like to change chips to coleslaw. other restaurants will normally accommodate but the service staff refused our request.
4
Interesting concept where you eat without using anything. This help the restaurant to save in cleaning and washing. The food is good and fresh. Too spicy to our preference despite ordering mild version of their signature sauce. The service may need improvement due to under staff and huge customer crowd, as the table was not well prepared, with missing accessories and it takes a while to get anyone attention.Price is on the high side, but consider it's good expensive seafood, I think it's still reasonable. Atmosphere is not that good and there is no windows view as well
3
Overall its still great in terms of food. But I still prefer the Vivocity branch~ mayb its bigger....Orchard Branch have dining time limitation of 1.5hrs....but that is more than enough for us to finish up...just that it is not a place for friends to chill and chitchat...
4
Good service by the crew. Short waiting time. Good ambiance of the restaurant. However, eating time could be increased as we were given a time limit to be at the restaurant.
5
My husband and I enjoyed every bite! It was a great way to celebrate my birthday. We'll definitely come back!
4
The staff didnt recommend us to pay additional for 800-900g size.
We forgotten about it too till the crab is servered with disappointment. Prehap is too crowded and busy.
2
The waitress and waiters there have attitude problems. They don't smile at customers and always giving an unhappy face.
5
The ingredients are fresh especially the prawns. The staffs are helpful and friendly. Was a very nice experience. Waffles as dessert is a good choice. Crispy and delicious.
5
We went there for a bday dinner and the service was good n the food is great !! Especially the garlic butter ..
3
awesome seafood and fun experience eating with family and friends. will come back again and a good place to celebrate events!
1
A lot if things is out. Staff was not very attentive. I feel like becos my hubby is black there is a 2nd judging for him.
4
This is the third time we have visited this chain. We had tried the vivio city outlet, We have tried to visit the one near fusionpolis but it was closed on a Sunday. We also had no luck at the Turf club cos we did not know it was not open during lunch. However,, when we eventually visited this place, it was great experience. The one at Orchard central had great service. First, make a reservation. Second, ensure guests do not focus on mobile phone but the food. These days, u see people constantly on their mobile phonse that it is really sad. no one cares where they are walking to, or even looking at beautiful stuff around them. Now, coming back to food,We ordered the $88 ++ Sri Lanka combo which consists of crab, prawns, clams sausages and corn in cajun hot sauce or is that Vietnamese? Am a little confuse here though. However, the food is yummilicious. Order some corn bread to dip into the sauce, viola! yummy again. The Cajun fries were a disappointment though cos it was thinly cut. we love thick cut fries. The spice is insufficient for the OMP feel.We order lemonade drink and all were great. Then they helped us with the cake. We had ordered the cake from breadtalk and it tastes delicious. What was fun was how the crew presented the cake...that is, on a dry ice filled platter filled with plastic seafood accompanied by PINK...music...love it! So next time u have a birthday celebration, try dancing crab cos this what how u will love to dance!The portion is good for 6 adults but if u are seafood lover, then perhaps 4 to one order. U can also add on another portion of seafood at $40. so we think the crab cost $48 and the seafood $40, thus $88++Best way to eat it is let them pour the food on the table laid with a plastic table cloth. This is the fun of eating. No one will be looking at their phone.We still feel that restaurant should ban mobile phone excessive usage cos it is very irritating when one guy talks and then another one etc..hahaLets see which restaurant will start this trend. No talking , no texting, no gaming while dining...respect food. ;)Sorry guys...we just want you to actually have a great dining experience and also social time
2
- Staff who are part time and not really sure what they are doing.- Restaurant is not crowded but staff seems really busy(especially with themselves)- Pricing on the high side for the dishes served and service provided.- Best of all, likely water-BOILED CRAB which adds on hot sauces when you order.- Great marketing and photography, thats why you bothered to read my review while you are thinking of having it for your next dinner. - Go eat tze char better
3
Restaurant was packed on PH eve and can see that it was understaffed. Drinks took 15mins to come but food was served pretty quickly.
3
Seafood dishes are fresh but very expensive~ The Chicken & Waffles is surprisingly very delicious!! =)
3
The food is average. I remember it was so much better last time. The clam used to so much more meatier or maybe we were unlucky that day so we got a not so good batch.
4
Food was really fantastic, enjoyed every bit we were there. The only bad thing was that we still had to queue for 20mins despite booking for seats.
4
This is my second time bringing my friends into this restaurant. it was awesome. only thing is a bit expensive. we always get a shock on the bill. service is good.
4
The food is ok but portion abit little . Service abit slow .
If price can be cheaper or do more sales will be better .
4
Enjoyed the food and the service. Food was good, recommendation from the service staff were spot on. Good advice.
5
We brought our overseas friends to Dancing Crab knowing that they love seafood. We were not disappointed and must say that it was a great experience! The food was prepared well and with much flavor. Even the side dishes like Truffle fries and garlic noodles were delicious!
4
We had, among other things, the Dungeness Crab with beurre blanc sauce, and the Cajun platter. These two were the standout dishes. The crab meat was fresh and sweet, and went incredibly well with the beurre blanc sauce, which was recommended as the must-try. It's a buttery white sauce tasted both decadent and light. If i were to go back, I would definitely get this sauce again. The Cajun platter was generously stacked, and had fantastic cornbread and crabcakes. My favourite part was the deep fried okra, a Southern recipe that is rarely found in Singaporean restaurants
4
Staff was cheerful and helpful, and we visited at a time with close to no crowd so we could enjoy a quiet lunch. Food could be better though - the seafood aglio olio was disappointing; while the lobster roll had fresh juicy lobster, the bread could be toasted better and fries should be less soggy.
4
Fresh Seafood, yummylicious spicy sauce
Efficient staff
Need to improve on the cocktails - not to our liking
4
First time eating the seafood on the table with bare hands and it's different experience in dinning with other restaurant. Overall it's a good experience
3
The food here is quite average, but I rate it more for the experience - The experience of eating messy, finger-licking seafood.
5
always a good time and dancing crab orchard central with quality food and drinks. we ordered the combo bag #1.
4
When it comes to crab as a patron in a restaurant. Luck comes in very handy. Our visit was a lucky one. Crab was so meaty. Yum! Pricey though...
3
Interesting concept, worth a try but not the price.
The quality of the crab was good, but too small!
The crab could have been better "chop"!
The floor was surprisingly slippery!
4
Will recommend this place for the freshness of the seafood. But not children friendly cause not much dishes to chose for kids.
5
I made a dinner reservation at 7pm; on the day itself I needed to collect and leave the cake at the restaurant in the afternoon, thus, I called them up and they were comfortable with it. When I reached the place, the person helping me was friendly and patient. Not only so, later that night he was the same person helping me with bill settlement. I was very much impressed that he still remembered me despite the crowd, and he even asked me how was the birthday celebration that night. Furthermore, when we asked for the cake to be served, they went the extra mile to help with the presentation of it and even played music for us. Am really really amazed with the service that were given to us. Thank you to every service crew that night for the really awesome experience, it made our night truly! :

We had ordered the $88 set plus pepper crab $88. The crew didn't know which salad is Avail or which soup is still in stock. She walk back n forth 3 times until I had to ask her again to check full menu before coming back to us.
3
though team was still pretty much the happy bunch expected like any DC stores but service could have been much better. i guess they are under-staffed on a weekend as we have to try to get their attention a lot of times. and i was given a smaller despite the informing the reservation was for 7 adults and 2 kids, i was given a 6 adults - table of 3 2-seaters to squeeze with the 2 kids. and we have to suggest seating at the last round table but the only 1 of the 6 spot-light is working there. experience could've been much better as food was good.
4
Great food..... Super fresh seafood, Super tasty. Restaurant was not efficiently staff... Very much under-staffed... had to wait a little while for service........ But overall the food was worth it! Great Value for money too!!!!!!!!
3
The moment you stepped in, the first thing they reminded you were the dinning timing is 90 mins only. Refer Turf City branch.
4
Enjoyed the crab cuisine's spicy Louisiana sauce very much, but the environmental noise was loud. Great for groups out to party but terrible for a duo out to catch up on each other's lives.
4
the food is good but disappointed with the crab. skinny crab not much meat. but the rest is still good.
4
Had a wonderful time at the Dancing Crab - crab, lobster and shell, mussel are their speciality. They are cooked in different styles and tastes. The ambience is fine with capable and courteous service staff.
4
Staff was very nice to explain to us the different sets they cater as this was or first visit. The food was very nice but a little overpriced.
1
Made reservation online, specifically indicate that sofa seating preferred, and a birthday celebration. None of the above expectation was met. Server can't be bother attitude. Very lousy experience
5
It's my second visit, and this time we ordered two sets so we could try out both the Zesty Garlic Butter and the Beurre Blanc sauce. The seafood was fresh, especially the prawns. As with my last visit, three pax worked out to a bill of around S$160. It helped that I have a TungLuk membership card:
3
I visit Dancing Crab once in a while but i find the service at the OC outlet a little bit inconsistent. on certain days they are nice and other times they seem annoyed when you have a certain request out of their norm... Food was a bit salty than usual this time round. but overall all is alright!
3
The restaurant seem to be understaffed. We waited long for our orders to be taken. We also waited long for our request of a pair of scissor to cut the crab. It took also took long for us to place additional order for food and beverages.
5
The services was really good. Only problem is that they took a Long time to take our orders and with mistake
5
Had the signature bag. Seafood is extremely fresh. Serving is small for 3 pax. Crab is on the small side
4
The seafood was good but the service is a bit slow, maybe because it's crowded
the combo bag 1 is definitely enough for 2 people
5
Staff was attentive and recommended dishes as we were quite a big grp, atmosphere was great as well for a friends gathering
5
chili crab is a must, so great and classic.
The $88 combo is suitable for 2 persons.
Using Chope vouchers can get 10% off
5
Food was excellent - especially the Alaskan King Crab.... service was a little slow and the waiters forgot to bring our beer until we reminded them midway into digging in.
4
Went with my wife for lunch to celebrate her birthday as we were in Somerset 313. We ordered the Combo Bag #1 (with Sri Lankan Crab) with Dancing Crab Signature sauce. Wifey loves the sauce but it was a bit too spicy and sourish (taste a bit like Tobasco Sauce) for me. I think I may prefer the chilli crab sauce. I also ordered a Waffles & Ice Cream as a birthday surprise. It was served on a chopping board with a message "Happy Birthday Xxxxxx". They even played really loud music to get your attention and that totally surprised my wife and me. I really like the waffles with honeycomb ice cream. Love the whole experience and great service! Keep it up!!
4
The place was quiet despite being lunch time. But then that was good as it was less noisy, giving a better atmosphere. The food was similar with what we have eaten at the branch at The Grandstand but was not too happy as the plastic table cloth was already laid out prior to our arrival. Hence we just ate from the bowl and not the table as we usually would do. Management to note. Also should consider adding other types of seafood into Combo Bag #1 as there simply too many prawns. A bit unbalance in the seafood proportion
2
We were early and servers seemed more interesting in their group chat than assisting diners. To us, they apparently tried to avoid eye contact so that they do not need to attend to us. Worse still, 3 of them all were standing behind a pillar and when we stood up to go over to get their attention, the reason they gave was they were standing at a blind spot, which is no excuse at all. As staff, you should know where the so called blind spots are and avoid the area so diners could easily reach out if need be
5
Good location in the middle of Orchard Road. Fast & friendly services. Did not wait for long & the foods are served. Unique way to eat with the food on the table without any utensils like plate, spoon & fork. However, price of the food is a bit too expensive. Overall experience is still very good.
5
Went there with my friend and the service there was super fast! Food came prolly 5 mins or less! Impressive!
4
Service was really friendly, from one of the servers. I liked the Gumbo but my god-daughter found it too cheesy... Was there even cheese in it?
3
Restaurant lacks of manpower. Had to wait for 15 min just to have a staff come take the order. Even to call for Bill, had to wait quite awhile just to settle the bill. Restaurant needs more manpower.
4
The Zesty Garlic Butter Combo Bag 1(Sri Lankan Crab) was so finger-licking good! Totally satisfied our crab cravings üòã
5
I Wa rthere with one of my Friend to celebrate her birthday. It was a good experience and the staff recommended us the right choice of combo.
4
Just had dinner with family. ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä was yummy. While we went to get our hands washed, left bag and mobile at table and found service staff, Fanny guarding diligently. Kudos to such good service. Well done Dancing Crabs!
3
i'm a fan of dancing crab, however the outlet at orchard is always a bit more packed, noisy and a little squeezy which might not be to your liking if you are there for a more private dining experience. other than that all is ok.
5
Met up a few friends whom I have not seen for a long time so naturally, we talk and talk and talk till we forgot the time. When staff came to inform us they are closing, we realised that it was almost 11pm. There was no one else in the restaurant. They could have chased us out earlier but they didn't. Thank you for being so accommodating! We had enjoyed ourselves
5
I had always wanted to try the food here and I can say I wasn't disappointed at all. I had the famous Combo #1 which consisted of a crab, prawns, clams, sausages and corn, and I also ordered their lobster roll, and shared a glass of lavender lemonade with my girlfriend. I'm happy to say that the food tasted great even though it was a little way too expensive. The ambience was great and we were slightly earlier than our reservation but the waitress still brought us to our seats. While we were there, a group beside us had a friend who was celebrating her birthday and the little celebration they had was great. They had music and cakes in a cold seafood platter which looked great. All I can say is that I'll definitely come back again but not in the near future because of they slightly overpriced food
1
Made the reservation via Chope but the inexperience receptions merely pointed us to a table by the corridor despite the place being relatively empty. Until I make the request and we were sent to a table all the way at the end. Blame the restaurant layout. Menus were left and waitress just walk away without any introduction nor explanation. Took us another while before we could catch their attention for the order. Food was average, and nothing exceptional for such seafood experience. Certainly not value for money. Bill came and thanks to the fine print, I made a fool by making advance purchases of discount vouchers only to be told that it's eve of holiday, and I can't use them. Why didn't they remind me when we walk in knowing that the reservation was made via Chope? I even make exchange of cash voucher using the Chope $. Now; as much as I drag going back; I'll have to do that within 90 days before the vouchers expire.
4
Third time visit dancing crab and everything is same as usual however is lack of manpower on Friday night.
5
Is a good place for all kind of gathering... while enjoying the moment with the important one, enjoy the great food at the same time.
5
Service is good and the food is consistently great. :) Well done! Thanks for providing self-service cold water. I will definitely be back.
4
I have ordered lobster roll and combo one. foods are very nice. but when I approached the waitress and asked for mayonnaise or tar tar sauce. I was told that they don't have such sauce which I don't believe.
3
Service can be improved. Food is good but not worth the price. Special atmosphere with no cutleries provided
4
We had the mixed seafood combo served on the table and then eaten by hand washed down with cold Tiger! You need to reserve as very busy with Singaporean clientele
Very good
4
Have the combo bag @ $88, with 1 crab,13-14 prawns, some clams and a few corns, sufficient for 2-3. This price does not differ much from the normal market rate for seafood. The taste is nice and quite different from the normal chili crab, butter crab etc serve in Seafood restaurant. I would not say I prefer this, but it is nice for a change. You have a choice to serve in the pot or on the table itself, and need to eat with hands......so do not expect fine dinning experience and sauce might be flying around. Part of Tunglok group so should worth an effort to sign up Tunglok membership before your visit
3
had been to this place twice. Good service and helpful staff. Food is better than average but is a little pricey. Another thing is I hope the resturant would provide plastic container when packing left overs home. Unfortunately those left over leaked through the cardboards container and food was wasted when reached home at Tampines. Caused a mess in shopping bags too. Leng Geok
4
Highly recommend the dancing crab signature sauce to go with the crab bag. Skip the bag with the crawfish though - difficult to peel and the amount of meat is not quite worth the time. The crab salad and lobster rolls were very good. Overall very satisfied with the food. The only peeve was they refused to serve water in a jug to our table so we had to shuttle back and forth the water dispenser to get water
1
Went specifically for the moonshine prawns, which they said they had run out of. They also refused to serve us Sri Lankan crab a la carte. However, they clearly had not run out of either prawns or crabs, because both items were available in the set. We didn't want to order it because it had other things we didn't want, but in the end were left with no choice
4
I had lobster roll which was alright but not as good as I expected. The lobster was nice but I find the coleslaw in the roll too overpowering.
5
They serve good and fresh seafood.
The service is excellent.
Overall is a very good experience to dine in dancing crab.
4
Food is just alright, service was good.
Ordered a combo 2, lobster roll & garlic noodles for 2 pax.
Portion is just nice for 2.
5
Wide variety of very fresh seafood and the crawfish we had was juicy and flavorful. Prices were reasonable, staff was friendly and knowledgeable.
3
went with friends, just to try seafood basket. They quite like it, but I feel it's just average taste. Wouldn't want to visit again if I have a choice.
5
The seafood combo was amazing! Big portions covered in an amazing sauce! Loved how the place looked and the waitress did her best to explain so many things. You can just leave your trash on the table and you can eat till you explode! Was my first time, but definately not my last
5
We arrived earlier than time of our reservation but they let us in and attend to us anyway.. food was served really quickly, we ordered the signature combo, garlic noodles, lobster roll and a seafood pasta, a bottle of wine to go with! Everything was lovely and perfect for a mid week dinner
4
Nice ambience with good variety of seafood, the spicy sauce is really spicy but delicious. We need to lick our fingers many times. The only issue here is that the service staff initially wanted the two of us to squeeze in a small table sandwiched by other diners, even we have made a prior reservations! (Walk in I understand but not when we had reserved a table)
4
The lobster sandwich was nice and the Cajun fries that accompanied the sandwich was good. Also ordered the crab cake but I think it was not that fantastic. Overall, the staff are attentive and polite but the place is a bit noisy due to the number of customers
4
If you want a quiet place to chit chat, then this is not your place as the music is rather loud and one have to converse with a loud voice in order to be heard! Furthermore the place was still very crowded even when we reached there at about 8.30pm on a FridayThe 3 of us are all not big eaters, so we thought we will order a Combo Bag #01 (Sri Lankan Crab $88) consisting of 1 Sri Lankan Crab, prawns, clams, corn & sausages to share. I was also adamant in not spending too much that was why I got irritated when the waitress kept insisting that I order the Dungeness Crab at seasonal price which is something close to $200? I was happy to keep to my $88 Combo meal as the Sri Lankan crab was already sweet and meaty, the prawns were absolutely fresh, corn very sweet, sausage very tasty and the clam too. The crab Cakes at $18.50 for 2 pieces are expensive but they are filled full of tasty crab meat. One side is crispy but the other side oily cos the oil goes to the side of the patties that were lying down! As my kid is not a fan of spicy stuff, we were recommended to have Beurre Blanc sauce (white butter) to go with the combo although their signature is the spicy sauce. The sauce was so delicious that I cannot resist ordering their corn bread to dip in it. But alas! Although the corn bread is very tasty and smelt so good, it's sweet and more suitable as a dessert. I should have ordered the plain bread to finish up the Beurre Blanc sauce. Nevermind, I will go again and this time, with friends, we are going to try the Extra Spicy DC Signature sauce to go with the combo bag. The serving staff although busy were attentive enough and it's a wheelchair friendly place. For 3 persons, we spent $130+
5
Best to go with your friends or family, start feasting on seafood or rather crab :) try out their side dishes as well, just as good :)
3
Good and nice. But food a bit over price. Shall come again if another gathering. Location is good near mrt.
4
Food was good but waitress was very pushy on the Dungeness Crab. Cajun Sampler Platter was huge and nice especially the fried mushroom.
4
First time try on this, the lobster combo is good. The taste is hard to describe but was nice. The price is pricey also.
4
The Sri Lanka crab combo consists of fresh seafood and tasty sauce. The crab has since been smaller in size as compared to last time but the taste of it is still great.
5
Good food and even better service. The meals were served fast and hot. Will definitely come back again.
3
If you have been to the Boiler you would feel the serving and service plus amenities aren't on par. The serving is much smaller with only a couple of sausages thrown in. The boiler has much more thrown and offers fried buns on the side too. There isn't any mobile phone cover or the servers doesn't bother to ask if you want to pour the food out or leave it in the bag. They also have no wet towels and wash area unless you brought yr own or walk out to the mall's. It's just alright. And the servers seem rather tired. Not sure if that's expected on a Tuesday night.
4
The food was delicious! But sadly almost everything we wanted to order was sold out on the day that we went. So we didn't get to enjoy most of the things we had wanted to eat. It was a little disappointing. Also the waiters were really busy and the restaurant seemed understaffed. it was difficult to get their attention to ask for cutlery (they didn't provide spoons and we ordered soup) or to add orders since they were so busy. We had to wait a long time to be served. Also we were told that we were not allowed scissors to cut up the crab as it would "ruin the meat" and so we asked for nutcrackers instead. In the end we only received one nutcracker as they had run out of nutcrackers. So my family had to struggle with a single nutcracker to eat the crabs. Thankfully the waiters were nice and polite as well as friendly, so that made the experience more pleasant.
4
 Me and my friend were both trying this for our first time. We ordered the Canadian dungeon crab done with garlic butter. Flavour was very good and the eating experience was fabulous! On a weekday afternion with no crowd, simply perfect! Slightly pricey but its not everywhere you come by the Canadian dungeon crab. So it was good!
3
This is the first time I went to dancing crab. The lobster crab is nice but I don't like the fries. For the other seafood, the prawn is fresh but the crab is not very fat. Overall speaking the price is much higher than other similar restaurants, not so recommended
3
Ate the shellfish in da bag with garlic oil & gumbo soup. The first dish was interesting. The gumbo soup was disappointing. Soup has no seafood taste. Tasted more like sausage soup because it has chokeful of funny tasting diced sausages.
4
Overall the food is nice, recommend to try their seafood combo with blanc sauce (if you like creamy-kind) and lobster sandwich:)
5
We have been to Dancing Crab quite a few times and always enjoy it. The spicy garlic is our preferred sauce and the fried okra and corn bread are fantastic. They also make a mean chicken n' waffles!
4
Love the food , place & people. Food came within 20min. Will visit again soon i love the crab thou is a little spicy haha.
5
Everyone loves it. Especially their signature spicy sauce. So good that we kept licking our fingers.
5
This was my first time visit Dancing Crab at Orchard Central, Somerset. Crabbies and seafood are really nice,
5
Was there to celebrate my dad birthday. As i reach early that day. I place my cakes with the staff without requesting for anything. When am done with the food, i requested for the cakes. To my surprise, they had "doll" it up for me. with written happy birthday and dry-ice as effects. was a really pleasant visit. Thumbs up!!
2
We ordered two bags of the $188 crabs at Orchard Central and added 500 grams of prawns and clams in each bag. The prawns were really fresh and the clams tasted good. However, the crabs was a great disappointment for its price. The They were short of staffs too, as they took more than 20 minutes to take orders and settle bills.
3
A waitress kept persuading us to buy the Dungeness crab bag, saying it is enough for 2 to 3 persons. But actually it is far from enough!!! And it is much more expensive than the Sri Lanka crab. I feel cheated by the waitress... don't know why she did that... no mention that the food is prepared very very slow.
4
We ordered the set with Sri Lankan crab with the mild sauce, fries, ceviche salad and crab fried rice. My favourite was the crab fried rice, a must try for every visit. However, the ceviche salad was just so-so, I think it lacked seasoning. The crab in a bag was good, but I think the mild sauce was spicy, so I suppose the next level will be very spicy! Staff was friendly and efficient
5
Had a great experience with superb service by your staffs. Thumbs up.
Only minor issue is that the dining tables can be slightly bigger.
5
The reservation was really quick, with just a few clicks from my phone. When I reached there, they attended and found my reservation record quickly and got us seated. The service was good and most importantly the food was awesomely delicious!
5
Both my friend and I really enjoyed the food, though it may be a bit expensive. The service crews are attentive.
1
Poor and slow service, nothing nice about the food. For the price we paid, forget it ....go to another place ! One sauce for all the seafood... forget it ... go to another place !!!!
5
Staff was trying their best to provide service to the guests. I'm impressed by their sincerity in service
2
Had lunch 21apr'17 12:00hrs-13:00hrs table D2/cover 4...the chinese sgrean restaurant mgr Ronald (a scar near eyebrow)? -service sucks...trying too hard but fake...hard selling n can overcharge my bill informing that their system's got computation error!No "aprons" for my guests but provided it for other tables that came later. Can informed that aprons running low when i asked why my table not given...anywayz will never come back again n not recommending to any one..
2
I was looking forward to lunch there but ended up being disappointed by the overall experience. Everything was blah, from the service to the atmoshpere, to the food. This was strange given that the whole restaurant was quite empty ( with only 20% occupancy at the most) and the overall service could have been a lot better. But maybe the lack of crowd should have been a warning sign in the first place
3
Honestly, i don't understand the hype surrounding Dancing Crab. The crab was not very fresh. Although the prawns, clams and lobster were. Signature sauce is a weird mixture of black pepper and sour tomatoes. Zesty garlic is just garlic soaked in a whole bottle of oil? Not worth the high price tag at all.
1
Poor service staffs. The combo set was only served when we finished all our other combo. Staff look extremely pissed off when we took a long time to decide on food. The restaurant wasn't very crowded but it was hard to reach out for the staff
3
Food was not bad but we had waited for more than half an hour thinking the restaurant was short handed. Turned out they told us there was a system jammed but it can't be as a few tables who came in much later got their food earlier than us. I suspect the person didn't submit our order to the kitchen. The waitress didnt want to hear our feedback too.
4
Awesome! Nice environment, convience to access to the restaurant.
Delicious and fresh seafood. But its kinda pricey.
4
Had been to different outlet of Dancing Crab and I must say that the quality and taste of the food in this outlet is good. In fact, this will be our first choice in future.
5
Staffs gave clear explanation of the menu upon ordering. Food is good but kind of disappointed that crawfish is not available on that day.
4
It was a different dinning experience. Food was good although it was a little bit spicy. Shiok! Great for dining with friends.
5
We love the Dungeness Crab in Garlic herb sauce very much..fallen in love already. Going back again next week for 2nd round!
2
Food is normal, nothing much to comment. One thing i don't like is, they only provide disposable plastic cutleries... use plastic fork and spoon eat pasta or drink soup?!? in a restaurant?!
4
great food, the calamari was the best I've ever had, you could tell it was fresh, it just melted in your melt. lobster role was great, and the kids enjoyed the chicken and waffles. I would skip the lemonades, nothing special. Food was Great. Service could use some work. we waited over 15 minutes for a waiter, then decided to chase one down after people that were seated a good 10min after else were visited by a waitress. After that Dancing Crab was very attentive, and food came out quickly. It was a busy Saturday night so maybe that added to the confusion
3
We ordered the Sri Lankan Crab bag for 80sgd++(about 105sgd with tax) with Spicy miso butter. but they made a mistake and gave us the Dancing Crab signature mild sauce, which we were fine with. they still providede the Spicy Miso in a small bowl. Even with the mild level, I still feel that it was quite spicy to the point that the whole sauce overpowered the flavor of the seafood. I can't imagine what the spicy and extra spicy is like. And i think it would be nice if they provided moist tissues since you're expected to use only your hands. Some of the clams also tasted rather fishy. not all of them, tasted fresh. the Prawns were good. The Crab was good and meaty. but again, the sauce overpowered everything. I think if they toned down the flavoring and the spicyness of the sauce, things could have been way different
4
The Seafood was really fresh. Paired with the signature sauce - do note the mild is still a bit spicy - it was quite a feast.Do have different sauces if you are ordering more than 1 bag/dish so it won't be too heavy on 1 flavou
4
Waitresses are helpful in facilitating the vouchers bought from Shop.Chope. They are able to answer my queries and attended to me with a smile at all times. Wonderful girls :) However, the cashier guy was looking a bit glum and uninterested in his job. Overall I had a good experience :)
3
Seafood was fresh, but gravy was too overpowering that it covered the freshness taste of the seafood. Gravy had an overpowering taste. Quite a pity.
2
The lobster roll ($29.90) was pretty unspectacular. The dish was cold and served on a bun. It was quite unsatisfying as it is rather costly.
2
I enjoyed the food. Had fresh oysters and lobster rolls. The ambience and experience was all good until I went back to my hotel and was throwing up through the night. Its really unfortunate because i liked the place
4
The combo bag 2 consists prawns, clams, mussels, potatoes, carrots, corn and sausages. we chose the dancing crab signature sauce (mild) here to go with this bag. Your hands are the utensils here and dig into a table full of seafood.
5
Everything just nice
Atmosphere can be improve
Our table near the washing hand area and many ppl walking around us
hope to get inprove on this
5
Good food, friendly staff. Recommended to try the crab combo with signature sauce. Seafood was fresh
1
Service staff who took our order has an EQ that is equally low as his service experience. First-time experience to the restaurant and food was ruined by the nonchalant service staff. Mind you! The restaurant wasn't even busy when we went there on Saturday for lunch. Wanted to budget from the Chope vouchers bought, but ended up overspending as a result of a staff who couldn't be bothered to properly recommend, even when we clearly told him that we would like to keep our dining expense to within the voucher limit. Instead he just snickered. Asked him about the spiciness level he claimed it was "standard" -whatever that means..., but we ended up feeling its too spicy. Don't know if the bag was not properly shaken before pouring the content out. At the end, he didn't even give us our bill receipt, nor acknowledge my payment in proper at the end. I just paid the excess in cash, and thats it.. saw him went back into the kitchen. Very disapointed given the high price of the lunch, and poor service. I will recommend a rival restaurant instead
5
We ordered The Dungeness crab. It is slightly pricey but worth a try when we had used credit card perks - discount of 35% for 3 pax. Our total bill for 3 was $180+ after discount. For that we had the Alaskan king crab leg, truffle fries, crab cake and the Dungeness crab, 1 bottle of beer and 1 ice lemon tea. Complimentary water and facility to wash hand
5
A great place to catch up with friends eating fresh crab, prawns and clams etc... using hands (of course they do provide disposable cutlery). Service staff are really friendly. We had a great time in Dancing crab and truly enjoy the food in this casual dining restaurant
1
My sister and I were the only ones in the restaurant. Rap music was blaring to the extent that we couldn't talk but the waiter said the owner did not allow them to reduce the volume. Why was my sister served a salad with a tiny plastic fork and why was our water in a paper cup? I was born in New Orleans. Experience was better in Vivo
5
Food was nice and delicious, staffs are friendly and make good recommendations. The dinner with even made better with Amex platnium card 50% discount for 2 pax. Worth it!!!
4
Love the food pretty fresh and tasty, but will not be a restaurant I frequently dine as it is a little over priced
4
Dungeness crab - one of the better crabs i've eaten at dancing! Although it's on the pricey side as compared to combo bag.
4
As mentioned on the title, the dancing crab dishes were Delicious, Juicy, Creamy, Yummy, Dirty (dirty because we have to eat with fingers, take out the crab meat and enjoy the delicious spicy cream....umm yum!!
4
The crab is really big and nice!
Definitely will visit again ! I love the clams and prawns which are Fresh and juice!
5
Been craving this crab in a bag for so long, finally got to eat it again. The portion as usual was so generous for an $80. Ordered the dancing crab signature sauce with spicy. woww, never knew it would taste that spicy even for my taste bud. Lol. Should've just order the mild
5
Love the concept of using the table as plate, messy affair but it was sure fun. We enjoyed thoroughly. Very friendly and knowledgeable staffs. Fresh n juicy seafoods. It was my sis in law's birthday and the cake was presented in such a majestic manner. She loved it. Dancing crab crew made her day and ours too. Highly recommanded folks
4
Ordered the combo 1 seafood (Sri Lankan crab) with garlic butter sauce. It was delicious. The garlic butter was really good. Prawns were yummy. The only thing I didn't really enjoy were the clams. Would come back to try the lobster combo + signature dancing crab sauce!
1
It was our first time here, the waiter kept pushing us to order their "signature" dungeoness crab with cost us $145 for one crab and we order a combo set for 2. My girlfriend and me had such a difficult time eating the crab as it was only detached from the shell and cut into half. We were given only a pair of scissor please...we had to ask for the shell cracker. Anyways I had cuts on my thumb and fingers from trying to eat the carb. Told a waitress, she said "do you need a plaster?" also told one of the waiter, the crab is very difficult to eat? instead of giving us solution, he said it's very easy just pull the legs out etc. The food is totally NOT worth every penny. A few prawns, corns, 1 sausage, sandy clams and pathetically small mussels for $256?? Waste of time even trying....forget it
2
I don't want to write bad review but anyway it was unexpected moment to see how staff managed lunch time. We came here to celebrate our anniversary. It was around 1pm lunch time with only 2 tables have been served already. So we ordered foods, after 15mins, my partner got his food and we thought my food would coming up soon in couple mins. Then there was 2 tables coming, ordered food and they got foods before my food come out. I have been waiting for more than 30mins. So we asked a staff - a guy from the bar to check what happened with my order. He went to check and never go back to us to explain what going on. So we waited again. Later on I came to the bar and tell me to cancel it and give us the bill. He still wanted go to kitchen and checked my food and told us to wait. Anyway I asked him to void my item food and give us the bill. This was ruin our anniversary day I understood maybe the kitchen messing up with order. But the thing was only our table is the first table order food before anyone else came in, and only 2items food. How it possible to make this mistake. And I can see how staff managed even the restaurant not busy. With this review I hoped the management team can work with this problem.
4
Enjoyable dinner with my partner at Dancing Crab. Good food and casual ambience :) Good place to have dinner after a hard week's work.
4
My friends n I enjoyed the signature sauce with the crabs combo which had prawns, sausage n corn. Mild was already quite spicy n I am someone who can take spice well.

Me,my sister and mom eat out there on our first day visit to Singapore. I think the crabs and lobster are fresh and the Taste was awesome.
But i think it was a little pricy. It was nearly 400$üò∞
4
Good and will try come back again. On other of the food. Like chilli crab. But try I try for garlic flavor.
2
Had our dinner at Dancing Crab on a weekday evening, my friend & I, 2 persons.
No drinks, no sides, no lobster ordered. Just a Dungeness crab in a bag. Our bill... about S$350!
Ridiculously over priced.
5
The host of the day was just so awesome! The staff have even decorate the plate for the cake we bought for a birthday celebration üòä
5
really love the food here! the sauce and seafood were equally good and service and hospitality was great.
5
Crab is very nice with the signature sauces, first time there and the waitress helped us to place order and she made a very good recommendation.
A very satisfying meal !!!
The lobster bread is something different but taste is awesome, that's surprised me.
3
The Crab is nice or rather the gravy is nice but it is not really value for money. It is really quite expensive.
5
Eventhough there was a queue outside we managed to enter the restaurant immediately upon reaching bcus of the reservation made. Usually, crowded restaurants would also have a reservation queue, with the first come first serve basis but for DC (OC) they kept to their reservation system to strictly keep the tables with grace period of 10 mins which made my experience a good one!
5
it was a good experience
Just didn't expect those who got reservations would still need to queue for a while.
4
Food was promptly served, along with good customer service. Tried the miso butter sauce, which was supposedly Dancing Crab OC's mildly spicy signature sauce. Tasted so-so only. Dancing crab's signature sauce is better instead, in my opinion.
4
Food is good, friendly staff. Staff able to explain questions asked professionally. Seafood were fresh.
5
Food was delectable with short waiting time. Of course, the service was excellent too. Definitely a place to visit again!
4
A first visit to the joint and I am liking it. We ordered the Seafood Lobster Combo Bag with Fried Button Mushrooms & Truffle Fries.
Great service, ambiance but on the expensive side (it's seafood!!!!) üòú
3
We had Lou Sheng at Orchard Central Outlets and the food is really fresh. Staffs are friendly and attentive.
3
Overall food served are not fantastic for the price we paid. Not likely to return in the short term.
4
The food was great but not really impressed with the service. The host who took our order was not at all smiling and accomodating. Then the host who gave us our order seems like he was in a hurry that the water from the seafood bag spattered on us, not once, but twice.
5
Had the combo bag 1 with original sauce at spicy level and a Boston lobster in garlic and butter sauce. The seafood is fresh and good value for money. Although to avoid disappointment may need to call ahead and pre order the larger premium seafood that's of bigger size for ala carte rather than the "smaller" Sri Lankan crab which is normally 800-900g (not exactly small but they have some really big and nice ones)
3
Fresh seafood but a little costly~ Location is good~ The waitress kept recommending the expensive combos & kept saying the cheaper combos are only enough for 1 pax~ As my partner is a relatively small eater, I order the cheaper combo following my instincts & thank god~ It's definitely for 2 pax~ Prices of the recommended combos is S$50-$100 more than the combo I've ordered
4
Service crews were prompt and attentive service! They are knowledgable and able to provide recommendation when asked.
5
Good food but value for money can be better. Overall was satisfactory. Will go again for the second time!
5
Great food. The crab was cook PERFECT and portions were well worth. The staff is help and did not rush us into ordering!
5
Excellent experience with great food and services. I will definitely go back again and highly recommend the restaurant for friend and family occasions.
4
The combo bags are quite nice, sauce is spicy enuff. But does not debeard their mussels which gave me quite a shock -.-
Value for money but stay away from the garlic noodles as it is tasteless and dry!!!
4
one of the mussel i think it is not fully cooked, we can not open it. that is the only shortage. The rest of food are very nice.
4
Dancing crabs are really taste great! But the price are rather on the high side.. Go for dungeness crab instead of the normal sri lakan crab, as it has more meat and bigger.
3
One time for us it's enough here. 2 adults and 1 children. We paid around 350 SGD (without wine). 1 crab 1,8 kg and 3 king crab leg... Food was average. Service so so.
5
Service staff was kind enough to call a few hours before my reservation at dancing crab. Called to double confirm the necessary arrangement needed for the bday surprise so that everything went on as planned. Thank you! Enjoyed my time with my family at Dancing crab. :)
4
Though there were 4 of us there, we ordered the crab combo for 2 people and topped up with a set of crabcakes, seafood pasta and truffle fries. We loved the crabcakes with the generous filling of real crabmeat. And the fries were crispy and flavourful. We would have ordered plain fries if they had it as the truffle oil drizzledwas quite minimal. We found the seafood pasta too creamy for our taste. Overall, it was an enjoyable visit with good company and food
3
You got to try the Yu Sheng, it's very tasty and refreshing, something different from the traditional Yu Sheng and not forgetting the all time favourite crab rockfellar!
5
The service staff is very friendly, she also help us when we told her we are celebrating my friend's bday.
4
It was fun eating crab directly from the table! My daughter and I loved the signature sauce and the lobster rolls! A little pricey but great for special occasions!
4
Price is reasonable. Seafood is fresh. Restaurant is clean. Overall, it's a good place for friends or family to gather.
5
Had a casual lunch with my wife there. Totally enjoyed the experience there. The service staff took the effort to explain. The different type of crabs. Food was served less than 10 minutes after we ordered. Definitely will visit again.
4
Food was fresh and delicious. It was fun eating with hands, and on the table.
Price was pricey but somehow it was worth it.
4
Went there with my bf. We made reservation, hence avoided the queue. We ordered Combo Bag 1 ($80++) with garlic butter sauce, and topped up $2 for additional Dancing Crab classic sauce (mild spicy), and 1 basket of truffle fries. This is my bf's first time here, hence he was quite amazed by the concept of "your hands as your cutlery". Taste wise, the crabs, prawns, clams and sweet corns are succulent enough and mixed well with garlic butter sauce! The atmosphere is towards the noisy end. The price is quite steep though ($80++ for only 300g of crabs in the Combo). Will consider revisiting if there's promotion in the future
4
Overall, the food from dancing crab were really good. tried the garlic butter flavour for the seafood platter of with the mini version of lobster, prawns, saudages and clams. for the spicy tomato base flavour, there are ingredients like the crab, clams, sausages and prawns. Both were delicious, however, I am someone who would prefer a more buttery savoury taste, I would prefer the garlic butter over the tomato base one as it is more towards sour and savoury. the service was good with friendly and helpful staff :)
4
Shared a seafood combo bag with my friend and had a lobster roll to myself. Good selection of bottled beers but only Tiger beer as draft. Overall the bottled beers are rather overpriced but with louisiana seafood, a beer is a must to wash down, so I had a Magic Hat beer, one of their many craft beers available on their drink menu, its taste was drowned by the spicy Dancing Crab signature seasoning; I am sure it would have been great on another day by itself.Lobster roll bun was rather disappointing stuffed with coleslaw shreds, it could have been buttered and made more moist. Just didn't go well with the lobster which was not too bad.The place is filled to the max with more couples waiting in line outside, and I was seated right away because I had a reservation. It is advisable to Chope and get the Chope vouchers for the particular Dancing Crab you visit, which gets you a 10% discount off a $50 voucher (was reminded about this by the waitress when ordering). All in all an enjoyable evening as I was craving Louisiana seafood and in the heart of Orchard road, this place was to me more affordable than Cajun Kings, for example
2
It was New Year‚Äôs Day and I was looking forward to a good first meal of the year, but my experience at Dancing Crab Orchard Central made me regret going there. I had heard good things about the crab there, but not wanting to order a crab, my friend and I decided to order the crab fried rice and seafood jambalaya. To be sure, the seafood was good ‚Äì but that was the only part of the dish that was. The rice was oily and lacked flavour, and we began to feel ‚Äòjelak‚Äô (satiated and repulsed) before we were even halfway through. What made the whole experience worse was the use of disposable cutlery and plastic cups for the self-service water ‚Äì most environment-unfriendly! And to think we were imposed a 10% service charge for what was hardly service at all
4
Is was a birthday celebration dinner. Crabs r so fresh and those service staff r so friendly looking, service r not bad too.
4
The waiter recommended the more expensive crab but we went ahead with the Sri Lanka crab, which was decent. The buerre blanc sauce was tasty
4
Crabs was fleshy and tasty, loved the various sauce options. As always, the clams are big and juicy! However, the price is a tad steep.
5
never failed me for the delicious and fresh seafood platter! nice ambience and all the staffs are friendly!
5
It was our first time visiting Dancing Crab celebrating my wife's birthday. I indicated to have a birthday cake when booking via Cooper but nothing happened. Great food and service though!
4
The food was tasty but price is too steep. May consider to visit if there is discount. Ambience too noisy.
4
We was lucky we got a corner sitting which I have requested but there was no guarantee for the seating due to its kinda pack on a weekend.
Food was great with my loved ones.
3
Literally. You are supposed to pour out their served dishes onto the white paper covered table and eat from there with bare hands. A plastic apron and disposable gloves are provided for each guest. You will be given disposable small plastic forks/spoons sparingly upon request. We ate there just for the rustic experience. Not for those who fancy fine dining or even just proper dining. Food is okay generally. Only one waiter seemed to have some customer service orientation. The others didn't seem to care much, let alone explain how the concept works for first timers like us who had to look around to see what others were doing. May seem like a fun concept for kids (or some adults for that matter) but I find it rather unhygienic that I have to eat my food on the same table where I have to place my waste as well. And God forbid that you should have left over to pack...coz when they pack they may accidentally sweep your waste along
2
I've visited the turf city branch and the experience was all good. For the orchard central branch, this was completely the opposite. Booked for 8.30 and arrived early at 8. There was no crowd at the counter but no table was avaiable early so was told to come back later and they would call if a table was available (absolutely fine). No call came and when we came back at the booking time, was told I had to instead queue in a "reservation queue".Firstly why provide a booking service if they can't keep to schedule? If I then have to queue what is the point?Secondly the staff should be more transparent and honest about the situation. It's ok if I have to queue but at least be upfront instead of telling me to go away and to come back later to find out I have to queue (despite arriving early when there was nobody queuing and even promising to call!)The food was good and the manager was very friendly and tried his best to make up for the situation. Hopefully they will consider this when training their front of house staff and managing their booking system. From this experience I cannot recommend this branch but try the others
4
Went with one friend and had the combo set which came with one crab, several prawns, clams, sweet corn and a sausage all coated with a delightfully sinful garlic butter gravy. The fun part was eating with our hands and putting the food on the table. We also ordered the beer batter fried mushrooms which were succulent and nicely coated will the lipsmackingly good batter. The service staff were also friendly and attentive. Verdict: highly recommended - be sure to make a reservation otherwise you will have to wait for awhile
5
Crabs out of the bag? Oh it was a beautiful mess! Not my first time here and I do come back often! Love!
3
The messy dining experience is interesting the first time but there are so few staff you hardly get any service.
3
if u wanted to eat seafood in town, then this is ok. the sides are pretty gd though. rather pop with friends
4
The seafood was fresh, food was amazing and so was the service. Only down side was that they were out of oysters on a Monday and the music was a little too loud. Other than that, we totally enjoyed our time there.
4
good service but when come to seldom music to play off for bd celebration or xmas selling drink promotion the music is rather too loud..
4
It is quite pricey with regards to the quantity of food served but there can be no doubt that you would be getting quality seafood.
3
Been there few times. Dungeness crab was awesome and big and expensive :D Expecting around $180 for that giant crab. My mother loves alaskan king crab but the experience is on luck as the freshness is huge issue here. It was great the first time i have it as the sauce is great on it but then everytime i have it since the quality is just getting worse as it is not fresh most of the time. Oh yes, get the combo bag especially with garlic or Beurre Blanc source. Also get some breads to go with all those yummy sauces. Boston Lobster is a good choice and their bag cooking timing on the lobster is perfect.
4
Food was good - server recommended on better food choice, although recommendation might be a bit too expensive hence discernment needed.Service was good - servers are prompt. While we were there, we saw a mini birthday celebration! It was quite interesting! Might consider visiting for future birthday celebrations too
3
Food is good but pricey. Ambience is poor. Certainly not for those who don't enjoy eating using your hands only and on a messy table - no plates and utensils provided. Seating is bad as place is small and they cramped customers around small tiny tables ... like my group of 3 was initially given a table meant for 2 only even tho I made a table reservation weeks in advance.... and was given a slightly bigger table only after I complained.
5
Run by the Tung Lok group of resto's this is a fantastic nod to cajun food. Great atmosphere and very accommodating staff. The seafood sets are awesome and our favorite is any of them with the spicy garlic butter. The fried okra is as fresh as any i have ever had in my life and the corn bread is heavenly. The jambalaya and √âtouff√©e is very passable as well considering the owners are not actual creoles. Highly suggested!The BEST thing hands down on the menu is the Chicken n' Waffles. Have tried the majority of these dishes in Sing and this plus the Clinton St. Bakery are by far the best if you are not into seafood.Also the fizzy drinks are very well done, although a bit pricey...Go hungry as the portions are generous and don't wear fancy clothes as eating is all hands on and quite messy, but that is as it should be..
5
Great experience with no utensils needed on the table except my garlic noodle. Taste really good but somehow a little costly.
Your staffs respond fast with excellent customer service!
Good Job!
5
crawfish!!!! gumbo!!!!! beignet!!!!! all our favourite foods. 23 never imagined we could get them in Singapore. service staff were friendly and helpful.
highly recommended- spicy crawfish with butter bread
don't forget to end the meal with hot coffee (real good) and beignet.
5
Good food with value. Great atmosphere. Perfect place to catch up with friends. Seafood always fresh, third visit in a year!
5
First time trying out dining at dancing crab. Reservation was smooth and was greeted by friendly staff!
3
Terrible service. Staffs rush the customers to order food as the queue is very long. It's very noisy and uncomfortable to dine in.
4
We loved the dungeness crab. Meat is firm and sweet. The prawns and mussels were fresh. However the spicy sauce is a tad too salty.
4
The food was delicious. We had the dungeness crab bag on spicy sauce, seafood on garlic and butter, crab cakes and more. The service is fast and friendly.
4
Had a simple birthday celebration and staff were spontaneous to sing along the birthday song with us.
Service crew Fanny is patient with our several queries about the food menu
4
food was good but on the pricey side. service staff were friendly. there were so many shrimps man. i get nightmares of that now.
5
Came here with a group of friends, and ordered the well recommended combo bag and crab cakes and chicken waffles. All were uniformly excellent, especially the crab cakes. Pictures attached probably says it better than anything else - we got the dungeness crab combo. Meaty and luscious, it was very enjoyable. While I like my sauces spicy, some of my friends who can't really take heat even found the mild sauce quite spicy. So if you or your friends can't take spicy, suggest ordering a non spicy sauce altogether. Would I come back here? Yes, but only if I got some discount t deals. We belatedly found out that you could get a 50% discount for a group of two if you ordered two mains above 30 dollars. Similar deals exist for higher groups of people. So our meal cost quite a bit more than it could have. Next time if there is a similar deal, then I would definitely come back. Otherwise a mean for two could around 50 sgd a head. For that price, I'd rather go to Roland or jumbo for some chilli or pepper crab.
4
6 of us in the family were there to celebrate a family member birthday. The 1.5,crabs or sets of 2 were not pretty cooked for the larger crab and the gravies do not sink in.
5
Love the original dancing crab sauce with the crab bag- totally gorgeous!! My guests and my partner loved it very very much!
4
this is my 4th time there, food is nice, staff is friendly~
price is bit expensive, but it is worth,
5
The seafood is fresh and well cooked as usual. The service was prompt and attentive too. Orchard central is my favourite outlet because of the centralised location
5
Japs love seafood. I'm glad I brought them to Dancing Crab, they totally loved it to the max! It was finger licking good!
4
Had a fantastic time dining here. The Dungeress Crab is a must try. Can consider the combo as well if your stomach allow
4
The crab I had was really good female crab üòç the crawlfish is not so recommended but if you really want to try you can order just a little, even though it looked small but the meat inside is daebaküëåüèª
4
Food was fresh and savory. It was a bit pricey but it is okay if you go there once in a while. Staff was friendly too, it was a peak period for them but they were still able to attend to us in a friendly manner.
5
We were late for our reservation and was prepared that the restaurant will give up our table. True enough, the table was released but the staff was professional and put it across nicely. We were also given a table a minute after. Two staff came over at different times to check on the food which made us feel valued. The music was great, atmosphere was awesome and food was excellent. The crab cakes were especially yummy and the Dungeness crab was cooked to perfection. We will definitely visit again soon
5
We come here about once a month and find the consistency of the food and the service a joy. Great flavours, lots of options, and about the same price range as a decent sushi restaurant. The big bonus is for the kids (all 3 of them are under 7) who love eating here - permission to be messy
5
Fabulous place for crab lover like me. A must to order their crab with their signature spicy sauce. Try the clam & crab cake as well. Prawns are very fresh.
4
The service provided is good. The staff make an effort to to explain or recommending to us what is suitable for 2 of us. The lobster taste excellent....fresh and tender.
The only thing i dhn really like is the music is too noisy
4
Food is yummy. Like the crab combo . I should have asked for less spicy. Overall we enjoyed our lunch and company.
5
The service at this outlet is very good and the staff were all friendly and very accomodating when my partner and I have to shift the reservation timing to a later slot. Kudos to the team!(:
5
Good food. Convenient location. Friendly staffs. The only setback was automated reservation calls with specific timings.
4
Celebrated my friend's birthday at Dancing Crab @ Orchard Central. The seafood were very fresh but we felt that it was a bit overpriced (especially when the service staff told us that the crab is smaller than usual on that day). So, shouldn't they offer to add more prawns and/or clams to top up the difference
5
We visited the outlet at Orchard Central. Service staff were knowledgeable and helpful in their recommendations. They were also very friendly and cheerful; what a difference from other F & B outlets these days in Singapore. One of them even went out of her way to lend us her personal powerbank. Food was delicious, especially the combo bag. I did not like the soft waffles they used for the caesars salad - would have preferred the usual crouton. The desserts of waffles and Nutella balls were quite average, but the savory dishes were definitely good
4
When we visited, we ordered battered shrimps and sandwiches, as well as the side orders of fries. The main dishes were pretty good, but not so unique in a sense, other than the fact that its seafood. But, I really liked the fries. Those are some good fries, as they aren't too oily. The atmosphere is really lively, with many people enjoying the seafood
3
Service was quite terrible because the waiteresses were quite unfriendly. Black faces aside, the restaurant offers set lunch menu which is a pretty good deal. But I would rather not go back again. Just to quote an incident of poor service attitude that we experienced, one of the senior waitress asked in mandarin if we needed plates, but both my partner and I misheard her and thought she was asking if we would like to order. We said no, hence she asked, "You don't need plates for your food??"We immediately said yes please. However, when she brought the plates to us she also commented in mandarin, "You don't understand mandarin ah?" which felt very rude and condescending to the both of us. I have been in the service line before and can you imagine if I were to question my customers, "You don't understand english ah?
4
My husband is very particular about the freshness of seafood so my husband and I were really delighted and enjoyed the combo set 1 that comprised of the Sri Lanka crab prawns clams and assortment of carrots corns and potatoes! The seafood was really fresh and divine. The sauce was tangy and spicy such that I even licked them off my fingers! Thumbs up for this feasting!
4
The food is very good, though on the expensive side. However, the atmosphere is good for family gathering.
4
Food was great. Service was awesome.
Only feedback is genre of music played was too clubby & loud, which ended up as noisy. We feel like we were eating our dinner in a noisy night club.
5
Good service from the staff, and staff are well knowledge with their product sale. Very well done! :)
5
The staffs are fantastic & know theor stuff. Food was good & reasonably priced. Remember to make reservations.
5
The seafood is really tasty and good and the service is excellent. We bought the Chop voucher on the smartphone just before we made the payment.
4
The food was great and we enjoyed it. We loved the concept of using hands and eating straight from the table. The service staff were very friendly and attentive which is good. Overall we were impressed and had a lovely time at dancing crab.
2
Have been meaning to try this place so I made a reservation for 3 at the Orchard Central outlet for my mum's birthday - I even made a note of that on the reservation, but not only did they not acknowledge that it was a birthday celebration - they dumped us at a table for 2 with an added chair. What. We arrived on time, and even politely asked if we can be seated at a table for 4 but was told no, because we only have 3. So I pointed out that there's a group of 3 seated at a table for 4, and she said they actually have 4 people - I guess those bags on the seat look like a person to her? We barely had enough space for our food, and it's not like it's a cheap place where we shouldn't expect any kind of customer service.Thankfully the food was good and served really fast, even though half of the mussels we ordered were empty... The wait staff were friendly and reasonably attentive; they unknowingly made me feel slightly better about the terrible seat manager and hostess, so kudos to them. I hope that extra person you managed to squeeze in was worth more than a repeat customer, because I won't be coming back
5
We went there the first time for the chicken n' waffles not knowing that it was a Southern style seafood restaurant. The chicken n' waffles are the best we have had in Singapore and the seafood was very good as well. The cornbread is very authentic and the fried okra were the freshest I have ever had. Will definitely be going back
4
we were there for the monday special - lobster roll at $20. soft buttery bun with creamy lobster filling served with greasy fries. For $20, it was a good deal. other items we ordered - prawn with gritz was good. roast duck with waffles wasn't so good and kind weird combination.
4
I like the concept of eating dirty. Using your hands with your food thrown on the table. The sauces are very nice and service is great. I would give it 5 star if not for the crab which I feel is too small. I remembered I had a bigger one at turf city.
5
The staff were friendly to recommend us menu on the items. Apart from that, the food was great and quick.
Despite people queuing outside, they didn't pressure us to leave even though the waiter gave us the receipt before we finish our meal.
5
Was allowed to be seated earlier than bookings. The place was cosy, food served were good. Staff were friendly and nice. Bought coupon with 10% discount.
4
Seafood was fresh, lobster rolls were good. The Beer battered mushrooms were average, could not taste much of the beer batter. Overall food was good!
4
It was a good experience. Had a good sitting spot reserved. The service was efficient. Had ordered garlic noodles, bag of seafood, crabcake & icetea!
4
Most of the seafood are fresh. Quality of king crab could improve. Prefer to have more corn than potato in our crab dish.
5
Easy access, tasty foods. Fun way to eat.
I've already use here 5 times to enjoy the meal with my friends.
3
We ordered the Sri Lankan crab combo with mild spicy signature sauce. Seafood served is very fresh but I feel it's a waste to serve them in a sauce that is abit too spicy (even though its only mild spicy) and heavy (taste like tomato based pasta sauce). Service is fast though it's packed at dinner hour.
4
Crabs were average-sized. Clams and crab cakes were good. Seafood gumbo was smaller than expected but tasted great. Lemonades were refreshing. Ordered a cheesecake for a birthday celebration and the staff wrote a birthday message and sang the birthday song so that was a nice touch
4
I was there with my wife and her friends for birthday celebration. We were given 2 big tables in a corner which was great. We are probably quite rowdy and it was good to be in a corner so that we won't disurb other diners. However, the spotlights in the corner was really hot. Quite a few of us were perspiring while eating. Food & drinks was not really value for money. We spent $61 per person for 14pax (after discount). Do go with Amex Platinum cards as it offers 20% off total bill (min bill amt $200). UOB cards give 15% if your bill exceeds $200, otherwise it's only 10%. We spent almost $900 for that dinner
3
There were 3 of us and we were given a small table which was for 2 pax. A little squeezy for us really. We ordered the combo with the Dungeness Crab but were a little disappointed that it was not as meaty as Sri Lankan and obviously more expensive!! As for the desert, we ordered a waffle with icecream and one of the waffles fell onto the table and the waiter just picked it up with the fork and pushed it back onto the serving plate. I thought it was not very professional as he should have picked it up and replaced it with a fresh piece instead. Anyhow, though it is a nice place to chill with friends over a pot of seafood, the quality of food and service definitely needs improvement
5
Would like to give a thumb up for the awesome service!! Me and my friend is enjoyed our bday celebration there!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
5
Great food, good service. The birthday celebrations held in dancing crab looked awesome, the staffs are friendly.
4
Been there last Saturday. Really appreciate their online reservation with SMS notification which allow me to book table easily. The seafood is so fresh! This is my 8th visit already.
5
Tried the orchard's branch, the services are nice, they explained to us what is the famous in the shop and how to entire the promotion as well. Food - Crab, Prawn are very fresh and nice.. a bit pricey, but the quality is there...
5
Best Experience. its for my wife birthday celebration and she love it..
i love the miso butter taste and will certainly come back to the restaurant..
5
This is my first time dining at the Orchard Central branch, and like the original restaurant at Turf City, the service and the food was exemplary. My top recommendations: the combo bags in Dancing Crab's signature sauce, the clams in zesty garlic butter, the soy garlic chicken wings and the cajun fries. Oh, give the lobster roll a miss. It's tasty, but compared to the rest of the menu, it pales in comparison. You WILL NOT go wrong with any of these choices, trust me. Just typing out this review is making me salivate!!
3
Service was not bad, they provided bib to prevent splatters on your clothes, and the restaurant comes with sink and paper towels (only they ran out when I washed my hands). Crab in the bag experience not as exciting as similar experience in similar-themed restaurants in the US, overpriced for the food quality, tasted like bottled Prego pasta sauce, only hints of spice detected eventhough we opted for Spicy
4
ordered the sri lankan crab combo with spicy sauce. the seafood was really fresh and the crab was meaty. For those who can't take spicy should probably try the mild sauce instead. interesting experience eating without utensil and straight from the table. will definitely go back agai
4
Celebrated our birthday there. Food is good. Not too sure about the service though. Probably because of the big space and limited staffs, they are not very attentive. Only our server was friendly. The rest had a "whatever" face and attitude. The only thing that made up for the "whatever" service was, coming to us with a cute setting for the birthday cake
3
Found this place by casualty. We did order combo with crab, really nice spice sauce. However, the meal is not to be in Asia, we had the crab and combo and it counting by the season price the whole meal was 225. The place is convenient if u are doing shopping and u fancy something spice and seafood, good taste but I would not say amazing
4
Service was fast and efficient. Staff were friendly and nice. Overall experience was a pleasent and enjoyable one.
4
First time tried this restaurant and ate everything with bare hands! However I think a bit over priced.
3
oh my god, they will dance when we dining in the restaurant, it was so amazing! great experience given! the food overall is quite nice, we like their signature sauce!
5
Had an awesome first time experience at Dancing Crab!
Food was value for money. Wish they had bigger bags for the seafood combos though.
4
The food is delicious ! Place abit cramped ,they are nice to give us a round table in a corner .will visit again.
5
Staff there are friendly, 1st time using chope to buy the voucher and i was surprised that they still treat they customer friendly even i have used voucher and only exceed a few dollar. Is a cosy n quiet place for family/ friend gathering.
4
Crabs were really big!! We ordered a dungeon crab combo set as what the staff has suggested in view of we have 5 person dining in~ if you're asking about the price for the crabs is it worth it I would say yes but the sides together with the crab is too little~ I mean there's prawns and shells but I think I only found one corn on cob inside! Hahah!! And 1 sausage?? When we have like 5 of us~ actually is kind of too little for 5 person though as the staff advice was for 3-4~ so is S$188 for 3-4~ per pax is like nearly 50 dollars~ Anyway, food taste really good! The sauce is nice to eat with a bowl of rice and the beer battered mushrooms were delicious too!

Greeted , Seated, Bib on and all hungry for food . Majority of us was first timer here and awaits anxiously. We had garlic soy sauce chicken wings and truffle fries for starters and it certainly opens up our appetite. For main we had 2 combos, dancing crab signature sauce which is spicy and beurre blanc cream based and a Atlantic cod which was really awesome too. Crab arrived and was poured on the table for all to share. Serves with clams, mussels, carrots,prawns,corn and oyster. Looks messy but all enjoys it totally. Service wise I feel can be improved as they look short handed on dinner time. Beside this ,all was good . Dancing crab definitely got all tummy dancing with joy after the meal :

Had a late dinner with my colleague on Friday night. Recommend to call and reserve a table instead of walk-in. Must try the crab in curry flavour, garlic butter is so-so. Must request to pour all the food on the table, if not you won't get to try the charming part of this restaurant. According to my colleague, you gotta try the chili sauce as well cos is imported from USA (forget the name)

Ordered a combo bag #1 and lobster roll that has a good rave review, but it tasted normal. Seafood were fresh and the thin fries that came with the lobster roll was good. Quite big portion for 3 girls and we ended up not able to finish the lobster roll after devouring the combo bag. The damage after UOB card discount is SGD150+

Came for lunch on weekdays and we are the second customer in the shop! Their service is great but the food can be improved further.. The standard did dropped a little but overall still not bad!

Ordered the clams in signature sauce(mild), taste like spaghetti sauce in our opinion. The sri lankan crab in garlic butter is not like the usual thick butter sauce you get in tze char stalls, but is the oil you get after melting the butter plus chopped garlic. Good calamari rings are not easy to find, goes great with the sauce provided.

My family enjoyed eating in this restaurant. Very accessible by train, taxi or bus. Was able to get a table despite our arrival 1 hour before closing time . Great ambiance, service was fast and a lot of selections- sea foods for the adults, and chicken for the kids.

Visited the Orchard Central outlet on a saturday afternoon. Waiters and waitresses were friendly, helpful and attentive. The one who took the order from my two friends and I was reliable as he did not recommend more than we could consume. For 3 adult ladies, we had one Combo Bag #01 (Sri Lankan crab), two Lobster Rolls that came with fries and one Glass Noodles. The Combo Bag consisted of 1 crab copped into about 4 pieces, prawns, clams, sausages and corn cooked in a piquant sauce. Lobster roll came with generous portion of lobster. Garlic glass noodle was tasty. I personally find the taste of the noodles similar to what one can get at any well established Chinese eatery. So for those who come with Chinese senior citizens who are not so adventurous with cajun food, they can order this dish for them. The seafood was fresh and succulent. This is my second visit to this outlet and I felt it has retained its standard in terms of service and food quality. It is a good option to consider if you want to inject some life and fun into your dining experience since the resturants encourages its patrons to eat with their fingers.

Decided to give it a try after reading many good reviews. Due to the meal time restriction (all diners were given 1.5hrs), we got to have a super early dinner at 5pm.The service staff reminded us again before bringing us to our table. We ordered the combo bag #1 in their signature sauce (mild). That include crab, prawns, clams and other side dishes. Food was served in less than 10 minutes, which was good since we were given a limited time to finish. The sauce was too spicy for me even though it was mild. My stomach got the burning sensation after eating. Other than the crab, there were only 7 prawns, around 10 clams, and most of them have fallen out from their shelves after cooking. Then we found few big chunks of carrots in the bag, which was not indicated in the menu. Rather disappointed. Maybe it just didn't suit my palate

Tried this Dancing Crab in Orchard Central. Waiting time is kinda long because of limited tables and maybe it is due to Friday night. The combo is $88++ which have 1 Sri Lanka crab, 300g of prawns, potatoes, corns and sausages. (Note: Price as of May 2016)You can opt to pour the dish on the table or in the pot which might be too small. Anyway, most of the people will pour on the tables. Don't expect the taste to be like Chili Crab because it is western taste. Expect the Rosemary herbs smell and pepper. Food is fresh and quite reasonable for that kind of price for the portion.

Service and staff attitude was good but what was better was the ambience and the food. Food spread is up to you and there are many varieties on how you would want the seafood to be cooked.also an experience to literally eat off the table using your bare hands

We (3 pax) had the combo bag #01 (Sri Lankan Crab), combo bag #02, truffle fries and garlic soy sauce wings. Seafood was fresh, especially the prawns! The wings were so crispy and tender on the inside. The truffle fries were also great. Expensive meal, but I think it was worth the visit.

I've never been a fan of Singapore chili crab - overrated, not very tasty and wastes loads of crab meat. Dancing Crab is definitely a better choice. The restaurant is young, brash and boisterous. Loud music and eating with your fingers. Prices are reasonable, if not cheap. There will be a queue for walk-ins at the weekend

Great hangout place for big groups as they have round tables.. Totally the place to talk and laugh loudly (the background music is a little bit too loud that's why) and eat with your hands. The crabs sold here is not based by weight so you can just order off the menu without fear that it will cost way more than what you were expecting.. It is still rather costly especially if you're on a tight budget, however seafood is fresh and they have really huge crabs! We love the garlic butter sauce and cream sauce. They do have a reservation system to follow whereby at least half of the guest should be present in order to be let into the restaurant to be seated - reservations highly encouraged. We spent about over $350++ for group of 8.

Great way to enjoy crabs, prawns and clams, eating with your hands. Try their Dancing Crab special sauce. We went with mild spiciness which was great for the kids. Also have the clams cooked with the zesty butter sauce.

But, dont be surprised on the price. Quite pricey considering that we actually only have seafoods in here.

Ordered the first combo with seafood, really fresh crabs!! Calamari was fresh as well and delicious. Had their cod fish n chips as well - very big portions of cod - worth the $22. Don't be afraid to get down and dirty!

New Orleans, Louisiana inspired flavours cooked with fresh seafood. Water was free and self serve. Overall, quite happy with the meal. We ordered just mild and not too spicy but it still had a kick. Eating off the table was fun too.

It is a casual dining place and it can get pretty rowdy esp if there is a younger crowd for the night. The food is all put on the table (with a plastic covering of coz) and everyone just picks from the pile of seafood in the centre.We had a butter/garlic sauce as well as the mild spicy sauce with the crab bag combo. Do go for the spicy sauce based on however spicy you can take it as the butter/garlic sauce is not really anything to shout about. We also added on mussels as there was quite a number of us at dinner.The seafood is quite fresh and the service is pretty good

I had never tried Dungeness Crab or Louisiana style seafood so this was a great treat.The Dungeness combo bag with signature sauce was awesome, the crab has decent amounts of meat in all the legs and is now a preference over the Sri Lankan, their signature sauce is flavorsome without being overpowering. The Prawns, sausage and clams were fresh and tasty and the Po Boy sandwich was also great. There is something cool about eating with your hands sometimes and they encourage it, I cant wait to go back

I Went there with my family. I was quite amazed by this restaurant as no cutlery is provided. Instead, we were provided a plastic-bag-like apron to put on and ate the seafood with bare hands. Beside this unique experience, the crabs and prawns are huge and juicy. However, to be honest, the food is considered pricy.

We ordered Combo Bag 1 with their signature sauce, very fresh seafood include crab, prawns and clams. Love their Garlic Soy Sauce Wings which is really exceed my expectation, thumbs up!!! We have tried their Cheese Cake as well but it's just taste so so for us. Overall quite satisfied with their food quality and flavours, service okay and the only downside will be the waiting time. We have waited for around 40mins just to get in because of the full house. Luckily it didn't took them long time to serve the food. It's better to make reservation in advance to avoid the long queuing time. Reminder: It's a bit pricey if you are on a tight budget

It was our first time trying seafood in a bag. Given that it was our first, the novelty and wow factor is there. The crab was huge and the seafood was fresh. The combo bag for 2 was not really huge but the contents were awesome. Aside from the crab, clams and prawns, the sausages were really good. We tried Dancing crab first and then tried The broiler. Dancing crab is better.

Went with friends who aren't that bothered by pricing so the price is not really a concern for us. But if you are on a budget, do stay away from Dancing Crab as this place is not exactly budget friendly. A few varieties of crabs and lobsters are available. as well as non seafood options such as soy garlic chicken wings and waffle. The waffles really not a good idea though.Please note that there are seating times for Dancing Crab. Best to reserve your seat beforehand if you are coming on the weekends
