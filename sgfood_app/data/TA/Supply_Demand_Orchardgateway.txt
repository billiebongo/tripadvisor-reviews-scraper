Food was not bad but was abit pricey. Love the sambal marina pasta but hope there were more pasta variety to choose from.
5
It was a simple meetup with a friend that I had not met for some time. The relaxed and quiet ambience gave us space to chat and catcup. Staff are pleasant and prompt in the food serving. Overall I enjoyed dining there!
4
Food was very delicious! Will be back for more! Ambience was also pretty good, with nice decor. However, food was a bit on a pricey side.
5
They had intelligent staff ! My favourite ! N the truffle pizza was great ! It’s not TOP TOP quality food but you know it’s decent for the city centre food with cheap prices . But it’s above average .
5
waitress wasn’t very attentive despite the place was not crowded.
food waiting was also pretty long.
but the food was fanstatic
5
The ambience is great.. the staff are friendly and helpful. The food pricing is slightly steep though. But overall is good.
5
Patronised the restaurant a couple of times. Food is good as usual. Weekday lunch set menu is affordable. Great place for catchup with friends!
3
I had to try very hard to flag down a server to order food/request the bill etc. I basically had to get up and chase someone down multiple times. There were only 2 waiters for the entire restaurant from what I can tell. The food was good but nothing spectacular. The only plus side was that they could host a party of 10 and we got a table that's somewhat separated from the rest of diners.
3
the chunky truffle fries with the half bulb of garlic is the best truffle fries iâ€™ve had. the rest of the dishes were at best average given the price point, and the service was hovering on atrocious. the service staff repeatedly ignored our requests for water and sauces, and they barely acknowledged our requests, with zero eye contact and never had a smile on. i might come back again if i ever have a huge craving for truffle fries, but possibly not.
3
Our pizza arrived first, then two portions of pasta, followed by truffle friends and lastly our drinks. The result was soggy, cold food as we rushed to finish everything. I personally felt the food service was sped up to accommodate the growing queue, which is unacceptable in my opinion.Only one lady was actively waiting tables though there were a lot of staff milling around.Overall, not a pleasant experience service-wise. My companions and family were happy with the food and that is redeeming this review
4
I ordered the truffled toast with sausages. Bread is toasted crisply and the scrambled eggs were done fairly. Atmosphere was also quiet which and pleasant too
5
Food was served promptly and Taste is good. Having reserved the seats through chope, we didn’t have to queue at all
4
Love this outlet much more than the other two and it is definitely one which ambiance and food never fails to be always consistent and always tasty.
Have also always recommended this place to friends and colleagues.
4
this restaurant is located at orchardgetway at somerset which is very accessible. they have some menu full of surprises whereby the chef will decide for you. the food are overall good and atmosphere is fabulous. However, you have to mentally prepared that they do not serve plain water but bottled mineral water at $8 each
3
It was a busy Thursday evening. The food was good. I would recommend the dessert Tiramisu, served in a jar and large enough for two.A service hiccup towards the end occurred when I asked for dessert to be served. The dessert order was placed at the same time as the main dish, so I need not have to wait, since the restaurant was busy. When I asked a second time for dessert to be served, I was finally given an acknowledgement by a female wait staff. Nothing happened until I asked for the manager as the dessert had yet to be served. Finally, the manager herself served the dessert and apologised. It would be good if the wait staff who forgot about the dessert came by to apologise though

This Italian restaurant serves Italian food at its best. It was a Thursday evening and the queue for a table was fairly long. To optimise every available space, the tables were placed close to each. The menu was comprehensive with pasta dishes, a variety of pizzas and the usual Italian fare.The recommended dessert is Tiramisu, served in a jar and large enough for two; unless you can stomach it on your own after the huge main dish.Everything went on as expected till the service hiccup towards the end when I asked for dessert to be served. I had placed my dessert order at the same time as the main dish, just so I need not have to wait long. As the restaurant was busy, it was difficult to get the required attention. When I asked a second time for dessert to be served, I was finally given an acknowledgement. Time passed until I had to ask for the manager as the dessert had yet to be served. Eventually, the manager herself served the dessert with an apology, to which I graciously accepted. It would be nice though, if the wait staff who forgot about the dessert came by to apologise but nothing of that sort was forthcoming. Empathy is key in the hospitality industry.

I’ve been to Supply & Demand outlets more than 10 times and most of the time time the food and service is not bad. The food on this vist was good as usual, however the service was poor. There was a lady server who was unhelpful when we were asking about certain promotions and she was very rude when she was answering us. It’s sad that even though the food is good, the service and friendliness could have been bette
3
It is unfortunate that a restaurant which serves such great food is let down by poor service. This started even before we arrived for dinner on Christmas Eve, 2017. Two days before the Christmas Eve I enquired at the restaurant whether it was possible to make a reservation for the night of the 24th. The manageress was quite brusque and told me she could not make a reservation and I would have to come with my family as a 'walk-in'. She did not mention that I could make a reservation online - which I did five minutes later using 'Chope'.We arrived for dinner on the 24th and were shown to our table. Once our order was taken the food duly arrived but that was almost the last we saw of any service. Even ordering water or getting them to provide the bill was challenging. I asked the manageress for still water and nothing happened. I later had to leave the table to find waiters who would bring water and the bill. The lack of service does not do the food justice as my family and I enjoyed our meal
3
There is a wide range of Japanese / Italian fusion food choices. Ordered the truffle rice with grilled chicken and it tasted pretty good. Salted egg drumlets were normal while the mushroom truffle risotto were slightly on the heavy side. Overall pretty decent food though slightly pricey
4
My friends and I always come back to Supply and Demand when we have no idea what to eat. We ordered a cream pasta, the Morning After Pizza (our favourite), truffle fries and calamari. However this time we felt that the standards fell a bit, the pasta wasn't so tasty and the calamari was a bit tough. Service was average also, we were just slightly upset when we asked for water and the waitress said that still water was chargeable at $8 per bottle. Another waitress came by and offered us water for free
5
Went to supply and demand for the third time but this time round, ordered items from the menu that were the chef's recommendation and they're awesome!
5
The truffle pizza was the best . The restaurant was quite busy that night but the staff were friendly n intelligent in offering suggestions.
5
The food serving is decent and I love their food served at Orchard Gateway.
Try the chocolate cake with gelato. It is great too.
5
Celebrated my friend’s birthday and requested the waitress to serve the cake as surprise. As my friend is late, waitress is observant and served the cake right after orders are made. Thank you very much for the pleasant dining experience!
4
Went there for my birthday, food was pretty decent. However price are a little steep. Good atmosphere for couples.
4
Went there for dinner with a friend. The food was very good, the menu is quite broad. The service was a bit slow - probably due to every table being taken.
2
A small table was given for 3 adults and 2 babies. So we have to squeeze all the plate of food together. Asked for an extra chair so can we can placed some of the babies stuff on it, but was rejected, the staff says they need the space to walk. By the way, even with the chair placed, there was still plenty of space to walk, as the chair was to be placed near the corner of the restaurant. Asked the staff about the food, no one has any idea what they are serving. All have a bad attitude, it’s the same from the Esplanade branch as well. Makes me think that maybe demand and supply wants the staff to have such an attitude towards the customer or the benefits and pay are really bad that the staff are so upset and vent their anger at the customers. Noticed they are very particular with space, for customers who came alone, they are usually sandwiched between the tables and look really uncomfortable. I can understand that it’s a waste of a single customer take up a four seater. But there are so so many empty tables around, why couldn’t they let the customers have a proper space to eat, not like the food is very cheap. Staff came and shoved the bill in our face and shouted ‘we are close’ when it’s near the closing time. Not asking for 5 star service, but when I said thank you to the staff, the staff just placed the food on the table with no eye contact and half of her body already walking away. It’s really a pity because the risotto is really so so good.
3
Over rated. Some of the service crews are not very friendly and inpatient. Food are average only. The decor of the restaurant look eco green but guess need to do timely cleaning. Can see thick level of dust on the side of the shelves. Just worried if it goes into our food
2
Was served by student. Asked if supply water and she said yes but asked us to check the drinks menu then never come back with water. Food was served and we asked for water again then she brought us bottled water and 3 cups unwillingly but never help to pour the water. Being observed other diners being served well with cups of water.
4
Wanted to order something light and the salmon poke caught my eyes as I’m not exactly a salad person. The bowl appeared small but packs nutrients with avocado and salmon. To my surprise, it is filling too. We ordered both sweet potato fries and garlic truffle fries and my personal pref is sweet potato fries. Would have preferred thin fries to wedges style for the truffle fries though
5
This place has never failed to please. Pleasant environment and service with tasty dishes. The flavour of the day arachini makes a good starter to share. The other dish to highlight is the Maiale Orientale which is essentially pasta aka bak chor mee. Something different.
4
Overall the food is nice however, the service was not up to expectations. Staffs were unfriendly and they seem pissed serving us. Hopefully they will smile more next time :-)
4
Second time visit,first time visit was two years ago, food is still good as usual,new items add in the menu.
5
This restaurant is great for large crowd. Food has tasting n small portion which makes it easier for big crowd to share n taste more variationsof food they serve. Truffle sweet potato fries are damn good
3
Pizza was nice but crust a tad too crispy.
Gratin brunch item portion was surprisingly quite minimal. Was almost like a tasting rather than an actual brunch.
Still, good decent Italian restaurant in a prime location.
4
Great place for dinner with friends! Staff was attentive enough to our big group. Fries are a little bit costly though. But pizza-s are great!
2
Food was average. Pricey. Staff no initiative to fill up water. Staff no communications. 2 different staff came and ask whether they serve us the risotto.
4
Food was good although portions are slightly small. Atmosphere was good, relatively quiet. All in, this place is slightly expensive.
5
Visited Supply & Demand a few times and it never disappoints! Great place to have good food and chill with friends. A variety of food to select from, go for those chef's recommendations if you do not know what to choose! Love 'The Morning After' pizza and their truffle fries the most.
5
We visited Supply & Demand at 7:00pm during dinner time which was the restaurant's peak period. Despite only having a handful of only 4 to 5 staff on the floor, we were served quickly and never once did we have to ask for service as their staff patrols the tables frequently to ensure that all the customers' requests were attended to.
5
I really like the place and the food. It was very cozy and yummy with a reasonable price. Definitely will come back again.
4
Executive lunch was good and reasonable price. Best part is it allow advance order taking and reduce waiting time for food.
4
The 'morning after' pizza was packed with good flavours, a soft boiled egg and very crispy. Recommended!
4
The food at S&D was awesome. Seating arrangement not so much. I specifically requested a corner table away from others when I made the booking, but the restaurant had difficulties accommodating my request and did not inform me beforehand.
2
Inattentive staff. Slow service. Food taste average. Expensive IMO. not worth the visit, disappointing
5
Great ambience to dine in and food is awesome. Definitely be back again for the food. Recommended to make reservation/chope 1 week in advanced 😊
5
The team are very responsive. Well planned and great service for my friend's birthday party. Thanks!
4
Good service. We had pizza, pasta, truffle fries and tea. We couldn't finish the fries and took away :P
3
The restaurant ambiance and the food was good. But, we were told to take a table which is on the outer side because we had a baby with us. They said the inner tables were not allowed for family's with babies as it create a problem for them to serve to the customers. Not so satisfactory reasoning from my point of view.
4
Lovely Italian on second floor of Orchard Gateway mall - visited a number of times whilst staying at nearby hotel. Set lunch menu very reasonable. Offer good range of pizzas and pasta dishes but also some local dishes - can recommend the chicken satay and spring rolls. Lovely thin crispy crust to the pizzas. Can also recommend the lemon iced tea. Will return when next in Singapore
5
Excellent service and quality of food. the order was served after 15 mins and the portion is just right.
4
Visited Supply & Demand on three different occasions &their food quality nv disappoints! They're pretty much consistent &in particular, the portions of their food were perfect for sharing. Even the tasting portion was of a pretty decent amount!
3
Honestly were kinda disappointed on the service and also the food quality. Waited quite awhile on our drinks, pasta turned out pretty salty and risotto wasn't that impressive. Ambience was nice and locality was a plus but above made the whole experience pretty disappointing.
4
no problems with the reservation. good service overall.
food was good but salad was on the small side.
5
Food was served timely.
It taste good too. Service was good. Just a little pricey
Pretty good place to gather with friends on a weekday. Not so crowded.
3
Food is not bad, but vegetable salad comes with the main course not too fresh. Service is quite good.
4
The restaurant handled our group quite professionally, food was amazing and very well timed in terms of waiting time.
4
My second visit to Supply & Demand OC, delightful food wise was good my children enjoyed the pasta & pizza, service staff were attentive will be even better if they will to put on smiley face attending to diners..I will definitely be back with my families & friends
3
we were a table of 10 with kids.steak was not too bad, quite nicemy kids ordered pizza and they finished it without help, so it should be yummy. it looked like thin crust, shared between 2 (8yr & 5yr)Pasta on the hand, wasn't so fantastic. it's definitely not italian tasting (I had arrabbiata) and another had their fusion sambal pasta. Review was not fantastic either.their Asian dishes were better received eg chicken yakitori rice bowl had a thumbs-up, and she's a foodie. so, I'd take her word for it.Tiramisu is excellent. The best I've eaten ard and definitely the best dish for the day. soft, moist, flavourful. It's served in a bowl (which it was prepared in)
4
Carbonara pasta and morning after pizza were delicious. However seafood marinara pasta at $28 and the beef rice also at $28 were not as tasty and so much more expensive. Coconut mint cooler at $8 was also over the top as it was literally just coconut water with mint leaves. The lime flavour was not strong. Furthermore, once we had finished eating, the staff were overly zealous in trying to subtly chase us out of the restaurant by asking us upteem times if we wanted dessert or if we wanted the bill.
3
Nice environment, but service no good. Request for corner table and give us the middle table and yet asked for serviette and never gave to us too.
4
A decent place to eat if you are at this area. been here quite a number of times and the food standard is quite constant.
4
They have a wide range of food on the menu and some pasta even come with tasting portions for those with smaller appetite. Food was good but nothing special.
4
Great ambience and delicious food! Highly recommend the salted egg fries! A great place to chill out with family or friends. However, slightly pricey for the amount of portion they serve.
5
Recommended place to hang out and relax. The staff were friendly too! Before we left, the manager thank usans hoped we enjoyed the food. Food was tasty albeit slightly priced. Overall, a satisfying experience. Will come again
5
As always the dining experience is good. This is my third time. I planned a birthday surprise for my friend with a cake. The staff was helpful and thoughtful for planning the sequences nicely
4
Fast service , friendly staff, good recommendation of food , automatic refill of water without any prompting. Reasonable prices
2
My husband and I went here with another couple. The restaurant looked quite busy but we were seated straight away at the far end of the outside area. We were given menus straight away but it took some time for someone to take our drinks order. We received our drinks after a while and waited for our orders to be taken. We didn't want starters so just ordered the main courses. Eventually, the first dish arrived. About five minutes later the second dish arrived. They started eating so their food didn't get cold. We called the waiter to ask where the other dishes were and were told they were on the way. The third dish arrived and the veg and potatoes were cold. We sent the dish back but the waiter returned saying it was meant to be room temperature. Our friend asked for it to be warmed up. It was reheated and returned but the accompanying sauce was missing. The first two of our group had finished eating before my dish eventually arrived. The food was okay, nothing great and not very hot. We complained about the poor service and said that we were not prepared to pay the service charge which is automatically added to the bill. The waiter said sorry, they were busy! No excuse, wouldn't go here again.
4
From the moment we entered the restaurant, the homely decor was what immediately attracted us. The restaurant was homely and inviting. For two of us, we ordered the fried calamari, rucola salad with prosciutto ham pizza and penne carbonara. The food was not bad but not mind blowing. The pizza was generously topped and is thin crust. The fried calamari we had wasn't too chewy and tasted rather fresh. The only let down was the carbonara, which was too creamy. Pricing for the food is rather sound. The service by the staff was good but can be improved further in order to enhance the experience as a whole
1
The food is average over here, however it is very overpriced. The service is below par. It was 4 of us, 3 dishes came after about 30 minutes and the other one came about 30 later. Noone spoke to us or informed about the delay. The waiters were ignoring us all evening and we had to ask someone to clear our table as the empty plates were sitting for a long time. I brought this to the managers attention and he did not seemed apologetic at all. A very dissapointing experience
5
Very good service stuff, with very good selection of teas and awesome food. Be prepared to soak in the truffled filled smell!
4
Food and ambience was great. However, the waiters and waitresses could be more attentive. Needed to signal them for quite a fair bit to get their attention even though the restaurant wasn't full or too busy.
4
Food was great, served pretty fast. service was alright, the staff seemed a little short handed but still managed to attend to our needs..
4
Dropped in here to have a cold beer and a Pizza. Service was quick and friendly along with the Pizza which was very good. Enjoyed sitting outside watching the world go by. Will try again on our next visit to Singapore.
5
Great food, lovely environment, good food, attentive services and a great place for friends gathering!
4
The food is alittle to pricy but food quality was fantastic. Garlic Truffle fries was not up to expectation..
4
Pasta and pizza from Supply & Demand are highly recommended. However the truffle fries lack the distinct truffle taste that I'm sure all truffle lovers would expect. Furthermore the vegetables in the salad had lost their crunch.
3
Waitress offered plenty of recommendation. Loved the pizza - thin crust & crispy. Satay sticks were served over burning candle -lukewarm though. Would have preferred more cheese for cheese fries - too little for the fries.
4
My friends and i waited close to an hour for our food to arrive and we were famished. But the garlic truffle fries never disappoint. Supply & Demand offers tasting and the full portions for certain dishes, and we ordered both to compare the sizing. You'll be better off ordering the whole and sharing it with a friend
3
This place was surprisingly crowded for a weekday night. We arrived early, just around 6 pm, so the crowd wasn't around yet. But by the time we placed our orders, a queue had formed to enter the restaurant. We got seats on the outside area of the restaurant (open space opposite the entrance), which was more brightly lit and smaller than the main seating area. The menu had a good spread of Italian food. We decided on the pizza (2 flavours for and extra $2.50), chicken and thick cut fries. The pizza was delicious - - nice thin crust and just the correct amount of ingredients. The chicken was also tasty, but some parts of the meat just next to the bone were undercooked (which we fed back to the kitchen). The fries were very yummy as well, though not as thick cut as we would have liked. Servers were very friendly and quick. In particular, Sophie our server was very responsive and helpful when we pointed out that part of the chicken was undercooked. Notwithstanding the partly undercooked chicken, the food was delicious and we would definitely consider coming back again.
4
Flavourful squid ink risotto with seafood. every mouthful of the risotto is a delight. very delicious risotto, this is a must order dish when dining in Supply & Demand! The servers are attentive and friendly.
4
The food was great and value for money. Service was mediocre. One thing to take note is that if you're looking to order pasta, do not go up to the rooftop dining area. They mostly service pizzas and tapas. Overall, it was a nice dinner.
4
Set Lunch was filling and good! 50% off 2nd set lunch within a certain timing so bring a friend along! :)
4
This is my first visit to the Orchard Gateway branch. Decent and consistent with the Esplanade outlet. The place was a little cramp. We were a group of 7 that they tried to squeeze into a table meant for 6.
4
Nice place but can't sit longer as will clean and clean your table after you have finished your meal.
5
Delicious pasta, vast tea selection and the best tiramisu in town!
Vivid ambience & great service!
Will definitely be back! 😊
2
We visited here once the week before the F1 GP & once during it & the service was painfully slow (20mins for your bill is way to long).- also eating food upstairs in areas it's so dark you can't see a thing!- food was average at best... but given our experience as a group twice it's poor rated in comparison to so many more places in Singapore! Would not recommend it either !
3
I must admit that I was expecting a little more. The best part was the location, being close to the waterfront. However, the cocktails were not good at all....just too sweet. The finger food was good, especially the truffle fries & bruschetta. We ordered pasta which was alright but didn't really stand out. The service was good.
3
Located at level 2, this place is easily accessible and was filled by 7.30pm. Menu offered a variety of options but we wasted no time in asking for recommendations. Items ordered: 1) Cheese fries - average, should have ordered the garlic fries instead. Personally didn't like the thick cut fries. 2) salad - nothing special 3) morning after pizza with egg yolk in the center - average as well 4) white wine seafood pasta - average, not wow though it's a popular choice 5) salted caramel chocolate crust with vanilla gelato - was a good sweet ending to the meal Spent a total of $116 and got a bottle of wine free due to citibank's wine & dine promotion. However most of the staff there didn't know about the promotion and had to check with someone else. Could do with more staff training so that customers won't have to be kept waiting.
4
Hidden in the corner of Orchard Gateway lies this beautiful eatery, with its high ceiling, natural lighting and fantastic decor, it's a perfect place to enjoy a good meal. The Garlic Truffle Fries is fantastic although we kept stealing glances at the cheese fries on the adjacent table too while the pizza are pretty run-of-the-mill, although you can have 2 different flavours in one by adding $2.50.Overall, for the ambiance and food, the price is definitely worth it! I'll be back for the cheese fries next time
2
Food was good BUT when you go out as a couple you expect to eat together not for one to have finished before the other gets their food!!!!!!
4
desserts not bad.
food is above average if you consider the medium level price. we had the salmon salad as well, better than what I expected.
all of us loved tiramisu there.
3
Excellent Italian restaurant & bar with great service if it is jot peak hour.
Reservation must is you would like to sit.
Pasta and steaks very average.
Nice wines, however, not special nor Italian.
4
I have tried this eatery at least 5 times and each time I went away totally satisfied. They have a good mix of local and Italian fare, all presented in very interesting ways. To complement that, there is also a wide selection of teas. The place is manned by a very young team, all eager to clean your tables once the food is consumed. A good place to hangout with friends but a bit too noisy if you want some quiet moments with your loved one. Unless you make prior reservations, it helps to arrive before 6pm if you want a table for dinner over the weekends. It worked for me
4
Supply & Demand is tucked away in a corner of level 2 of the shopping mall; it was relatively easy to find. When we arrived at about 1 in the afternoon, the restaurant was packed with hungry diners, some of who were almost done with their meals and others waiting for theirs to arrive! But thankfully there wasn't a long queue and so we ended up waiting for less than 10 minutes before we were seated near the window at a cozy corner. The decor was a nice and earthly ambiance with warm lighting and dark wooden furniture being used. There are both outdoor and indoor seating, with promotions and specials being written on a chalkboard (how old school!). Service-wise, the servers were attentive and served up the bottle of water efficiently, food was served almost within minutes of each other and payment was a breeze.Between the two of us we had the Provincale Pizza - Tomato Sauce, Mozearellt, Onion, Chicken Chunks with a Soft Egg Set in the Center (S$18), Asian Inspired Pasta Spicy Pork with Thai Basil Pasta - Pasta in Thai Inspired Flavors of Stir-Fried Spicy Pork Loin with Thai Basil (S$20), and Carbonara Classico - Carbonara minus the cream sauce (S$20). We shared the pasta and thankfully we did too, because if we had not shared and just ate the same pasta throughout the meal it would have been a 'tiring' affair.For everything, it cost us about S$68++ and it was a pretty happy meal. Average cost per person would be around S$30. Would definitely go back to try out the other dishes
3
In Summary:A good place to hang out after work with buddies who do not mind paying a little more for food. Portions are reasonable and the food does taste good. Unless you head down slightly earlier, be prepared to queue for a while.*DETAILED REVIEW BELOW*Background:Dropped by this branch in Orchard as I was unable to dine at the Esplanade branch for two consecutive tries. I understood from my friends later that both the branches are different in terms of the food they serve and the general atmosphere.1. Service – 3.5 out of 5The restaurant has a friendly, smiling service crew that you kind of expect nowadays in cafés. Service is neither shabby nor excellent. They do appear when you require assistance but leave you alone for most of your experience there.2. Ambience – 4 out of 5We got the window seat, where we get to watch the traffic outside. Sunlight was streaming in but the glass was well polarized so we never felt a need to change seat due to the glare or heat. The surroundings are abuzz with conversations from various tables, but nothing notable. Décor is a chic mix of modern and industrial. 3. Cleanliness – 4 out of 5The restaurant looks well maintained and cleaned despite the crowd.4. Taste – 3.5 out of 5The brunch set was above average but forgettable unfortunately. The garlic and truffle fries were surprisingly good. You get a flavour burst with every mouthful of thick chunky fries which is crispy on the outside while remaining meaty on the inside. Pizza was a little dry and flavourless after the fries. Tiramisu was above average but also forgettable. Skip the bakwa ice cream; it is an acquired taste but I sincerely found it apt as a Truth or Dare punishment. 5. Value for Money – 3.5 out of 5The place is more for the crowd and experience rather than the food and service. The group that you choose to visit this café with matters. I will not recommend this place for a first date, unless a group date fits your idea of a “first”. Value is subjective, especially so when your group enjoys the company more than the food
4
Nice decor and ambience. Adequate staffing and enough customer attention. Staff are courteous and know their job adequatelyPrice of food is reasonable and spread wide enough. Standard of food is good and taste nice.In terms of overall satisfaction, something is missing ... everything is average or slightly above average but warmth factor is missing in the face of cool efficient service. Could do with more smiles and warmth to give this place the cherry on top of an already good presentation... pity.Conclusion. 4 thumbs UP. Must come again but hoping for that extra umph ! Cheers !
4
Went for a meal on New Years Day (night). We ordered one pizza and one pasta dish to share. The Parma ham pizza was delicious, however it came out about 5/6mins after the pasta. It would have been better if both came at the same time but despite this it was a pleasant place to sit and eat. The bar upstairs was also really nice for a few drinks after our meal
4
Great bar & Italian restaurant at the Esplanade, we ate there a few times during the Singapore GP weekend. The pasta dishes are very nice, but the pizzas were expensive - although that is the case in Singapore generally. Their cocktails are very good, and the rooftop bar has a great vibe
5
Arrived on a very busy night with no booking, the internal system for waiting is very good, noting your name & number, then you receive a text message which contains a link to show where are at in the queue, once a table is ready you receive a phone call asking you to confirm your table, very rare you see this type of system & gives you a chance to go around the corner for a drink somewhere else.Service was very good, Food was very good with a wide range menu & arrived in a very quick manner.As mentioned value here is very good, which in Singapore can be a rare thing depending on where your eating.Great experience & will be back when in Singapore
