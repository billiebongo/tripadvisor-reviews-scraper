I like the food . Good portion and are tasty . It‚Äôs a place for family to go and enjoy .
Environment is cozy and the price is reasonable.
5
Good food! Both Asian and Mediterranean choices are fantastic! Try the Hokkien Prawn Mee and the Sriracha & honey chicken burger!!
If no reservation, can probably get a table either 5pm or 8pm during weekends. Therefore, reservation is highly recommended.
Thumbs up!!
5
We had a office get-together here for the 1st time. As it is lunchtime, we need to wait a bit longer for out food to be served. service is good. will be back again
4
Food presentation was great, table was tidy and ready before arrival. Confirmation sms was sent 2 days, the day before and on the day itself.
4
Went there with friends for dinner. We had to queue about 10 min before getting a table. The menu is Asian, and western food. For Asian food you will find Indian, Malay, Indonesian, Thai, and Chinese food. The service was fast and the food was very good
5
Was there last Saturday for dinner with my family. We ordered both Asian and Western selections from the menu and were not disappointed. The portion for the Asian selections like Nasi Goreng Kampung was huge. I had The Royale burger which was made with a buttered brioche bun (yummy!) and served with fries topped with freshly grated parmesan. My daughter had the ribeye steak medium rare and it was cooked perfectly - nicely pink without being bloody. We also had waffles and gelato for desserts. Overall a very satisfying meal for the family

Lazy Sunday late morning and we're looking for places that not too crowded with Asian & Western Veriaty food choices. My wife suggested Rifle Range Road. We drove there as this will be my first time and I didn't know what to expect. We arrived at Temasek Club and headed to the restaurant without any reservations. We were lucky to get a table party for 3 as the time only shows 11:30am and its almost lunch hours. We were Served by mostly Caucasian waitress. I felt like I'm not in Singapore already. I love the cosy interior and huge window overseeing the greeneries. We ordered several foods as shown on the pictures. Will surely comeback on the weekend to have lunch here again with Friends. I would recommend the burger and the desserts.

~it's gonna be a long way driving in to the Temasek Club on Rifle Range Road but once there, just dropoff your passengers at the main entrance since Spize is right in front of it's doors~this weekend we'd a late lunch but even at 2pm this place was packed, a ton of local folks came really far out to this restaurant to tuck in and it's Halal so it has a following :)~service is very friendly and different wait staff were happy to serve... a difference unusual in crowded places, this one impressedLamb Briyani - YUMz simply YUMzFish Briyani - YUMz x2 the fish is a Barramundi such a treat!Bangers & Mash - my son really likes this one and I can tell from the number of sausages it's super kid friendlyLinguini Al Funghi - WOW my son likes this tooSteak & Cheese Wrapz - my son likes this one :)I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat, it's very very good
5
Brought my dad for a weekday dinner after two positive experiences with Spize(Rifle Range). Online reservation was smooth. A tip would be to indicate the preferred seats along with your reservation. Service at dinner was swift and prompt. For starters, we had hummus dips along side with the mussels + crab meat. Main courses we had Royale Burgers, lamb wrapz, fillet fish burger and morrocan chicken. The chicken was not impressive and lacked lustre, probably won't order this again. Drinks we had Grande Longan frosty and coffee latte. The frosty was absolutely great for a warm evening and a perfect way to complement our dinner
3
We had a group of 24 for dinner. Since it's a big group, we sent out order to them in advance.The person who was attending was friendly and enthusiastic but when the main dish came out, we were disappointed because most food were COLD. When we sent out order in advance, we didn't expect them to cook and let it stand and turn cold. They could prepare everything but shouldn't have cooked still last min when everyone is there and tell them that they can serve the food.10 of us ordered Wagyu beef steak and they were cold. what a waste.I like this restaurant for many reasons but I wouldn't come again with a big group.When you come with your family (6-8), it's still fine. you get freshly cooked / hot food..
4
Good service, delicious food! Great for group gatherings but need to reserve early! Italian and Malay cuisine were good!
5
Enjoyed the lamb chops that I went back two days in a row... the grilled chicken was also very good.
I like this place as it has a great view of the Bukit Timah forests and a relaxed environment!
4
The burger is very nice. The servers are friendly and helpful when we cannot decide what to order... Happy that they have waffles!
5
The food was nice and reasonable. Booked 10.30am and food can only be served after 11am. Overall good. Worth the visit.
4
Was at spize for a birthday celebration and apart from good mains the staff were very sporting with a rich salted caramel waffle with a candle and singing
5
Love the brownie!!! Love the ice cream! Love the lamb briyani! Coffee is great! Service is fantastic!!! Absolutely love this place!!!
4
Food is nice and the servers are polite. The ambiance is cosy and the pool view is magnificent. Food is also value for money.
4
I've been eating at the other Spize outlets down at River Valley and mostly, the one at Bedok. This outlet has got to be my favourite - simply 'cos of the ambience and setting. The food presentation as well as staff service was great. The price is abit on a high side as compared to the same dish you can get at their other outlets. But it's a good price to pay for just a nice meal out with your loved ones. The only setback for me was how inconvenient it is to get there. You'll need a car
5
I have never like portobello mushroom and I never had any idea if it tasted that good in a burger until I ate one in this restaurant. The service was excellent, their staffs are very nice and always check whether your need is satisfyingly fullfilled. Will return for sure
5
We are a group of 7 people and we made a reservation on the morning for a quiet spot. And this was met. The food was great. However, the speed at which the food was serve may need to be reconsider. One of my colleague has finish her main course but the main courses for the rest of the 6 people has not yet arrive. Also, it is rather hard to call for the waitress/waiter to add orders
5
SPIZE @ rifle range is becoming one of the family's fav dining spot with its wonderful ambience & great food. One minor peeve was music was too loud.
5
all went smooth....great service even with change of timing...food came out not too late..food there was amazing..atmosphere is very calm n peaceful..
5
Staff Gathering. Good service and good food. Staff responds promptly to any queries. Friendly service. Nice ambience l
5
This place is very popular. Remember to make reservation. Food is very decent for the price. Very nice atmosphere.
5
Thumbs up to the Boss for the excellent food and service! Will certainly be back for other items on the menu!
4
The only bad thing I could think of would be the waitwe being to slow on taking order .can seem to get order in 10 mins sometimes
5
The food is nice and the price is reasonable too. Ambient is good and I would recommend friends n family to dine at Spize.
5
My second time visiting. Brought my parents for Parents Day dinner. Love the atmosphere. Crowded as usual. Food portion was huge. My family certainly enjoyed themselves.
4
The restaurant offers very good food at reasonable price. It's housed within Temasek Club at Bukit Timah. Twice when we went for lunch, it's almost full house, with many army officers. Therefore a bit noisy. We made reservation and had a table overlooking the swimming pool and greenery. The menu is extensive from Asian to western. The truffle fries is very good! Must try! Nasi Goreng Kampung is spicy and yummy. My friends like the Royale - beef burger comes with fries and a big portion. The Penang Char Kway Teow isn't the dry version but has some gravy and a tad sweet. Not quite my liking though. Servicing is good and fast
4
Overall was great just that maybe the staff be more attentive for ordering food especially. Few incidents is we try to order food but they were busy with other stuffs or gesture saying will come back later or focus point maybe did not see us. Maybe can allocate more staff?
5
A place with great ambience, delicious food & fantastic service. Made reservation through Chope & it was such an easy & hassle free experience. Thank you!
4
It was very nice! But service could have been better, took quite a while to get staffs attention, as they were very busy.
5
We went there (Riffle Range) in big group. The service pretty fast and the people there are very friendly.
Love the ambience too!
5
Food 5/5, ambience 5/5. It was just perfect! Great for any events; dates, family dinner, friends. Food was high quality and the atmosphere of the restaurant was top notch. Will recommend to others and definitely pay another visit!
5
Without asking, they have prepared plain water and dates for us to break our fast before food was served. Great service and good food!
4
Good customer service... üëç
Nice ambience... ‚ò∫
Cosy place to hv a romantic dinner... üòä
Service was fast too...
5
Waitress/waiter dressing Looks all service are excellent me and family love this place to eat and will come down again..
5
Went there to break fast with family. Food was great, little waiting time for it to arrive, and the atmosphere was lovely. Service staff were good too! Would definitely return!
5
Always loved to visit this place because of it's ambience and service. The food is good and delicious! Good place to meet up with friends or colleagues!
3
The place has lovely ambiance and I have been there many times. The food is pretty good but there is room for improvement in customer service orientation. I was a little disappointed during this visit - attention was to our food orders and requests were cursory. We were assured that the finger food would come first but it arrived after some of us were having our main course. We ordered dessert to share and although there were 7 of us, only 4 plates were given to us and we had to help ourselves to extra plates in the end. We finished our meals and were waiting for coffee and desserts but no-one took the initiative to clear the table until we asked a couple of times. And this was not for lack of staff. There were even some resting in the lounge area outside the cafe. This is a club to cater to military officers and this slackening of good service (relative to when they first opened) is not healthy.
5
Love the high ceiling and full window panels. A bit hot in the afternoon as the sun comes in. Food is excellent!
5
A friend recommended me to eat at this restaurant and so I did went to try it. I have to admit I had the best food i ever had. The Burger was delicious..
5
Food was great with very reasonable price! We personally love the cod fish bok choy noodle. The kida meal are great too!
Ample parking for those who are driving!üòÅ
2
Just wait for someone else to complain.
We need to visit there regularly.
So, we don't like to comment too much.
Good Luck to Spike@Rifle Range.
5
Have always love dining there. Service have nvr been disappointing. Prompt service but staffs need to smile more.
4
We had a great time at Spize for our farewell lunch with a colleague. Good variety at reasonable prices!
4
Nice ambience for a relaxing dinner. The place was filled with families and office workers on the Friday night. Price of the food was reasonable.
5
love the service... especially the peramah (socialable) staffs.
love the food....
love the atmosphere...
5
Food and ambience was really good! Worth the time driving to Temasek Club. Service was abit laggy but understandable due to the lunch crowd.
5
I was there recently to celebrate my Parent's Birthday & both my parents really love the place there. My parent don't eat western food that much, so they ordered Asian foods. I can say the foods are all delicious. including the massive spaghetti I have ordered, this dish serve 02 to 04 pax. the waffles come with a candle if you request for it & also there is a bday song when it is being serve. I am satisfied with thier service.
4
Cosy cafe that sells many variety of food! Western and Asian cuisine. Good chill out place and esp there is a portion that is pool facing
4
Food is good quality, nice ambience and worth the money. Highly recommended. Reservations are a must!
5
I love the ambiance and the food. Thank you for the visits. I tried the barumundi and it was lovely. The mushroom soup was awesome.
4
A great place to catch up with friends with good ambience, lush greenery around the cafe, prompt service and a great selection of food.
Will be back again!
4
Located in Temasek Club, this gem of a find served up delectable local favourites for a very good price. I liked the fact that it was overlooking the pool, and it was a pretty romantic dinner experience at that.
4
Nice venue to celebrate a team milestone. Highly recommended to make advance booking. Good food, good company and we also got a nice view of the pool
5
The staff was fabulous in making our group of 30 comfortable during our dining at the restaurant. Fabulous service and food!! Well done!!

Since my friend 1st brought me to Spize @Rifle Range, I have been going back there a few more times because I like the food and ambience there. However my last visit there was disappointing. After waiting for more than half an hour for my order of Morrocan Chicken to be served and the majority of my colleagues (there were 12 of us) has gotten their order and almost finishing their meal, I was presented with a charcoal black chicken. Shocked, I ask the waiter if this dish is meant to be this way, he agreed that it was "bit burnt" and took it back to the kitchen. Another staff then came over to advise that I need to wait another 15 mins or so for my order to be cooked and any other western meal will be the same - at least 15 min waiting time!!! If I order Chinese, it is faster. So I have no choice - as I cannot make the rest of my colleagues wait for me, I had chosen the Penang Char Kway Teow and it was awful. It was a bit too sweet for my liking and the colour (which comes from the dark sauce) is not the Penang kway teow that I am accustomed to. Hence it is an understatement to say I did not enjoy the food that lunch.
5
Visited the spize restaurant during the weekday evening. It was pretty quiet with only a few tables of guests. Ambience of restaurant was good and suitable for a date.Food wise was good. Despite the slightly high price, the portion was pretty big and filling. Out of the window was a view if the nearby hills and also the swimming facilities below. A quiet location with good food. Definitely recommended for couples dating. There are also big table that can cater for 10 people, but generally place is not loud.
5
We were there for breakfast on a weekday, it was quiet and nice. We were given a table with pool view. My baby loved it! The place is very nicely done up and service was good. Food was average though, we ordered American breakfast and the croissants. Highly recommend if you want a quiet, relaxing meal.
4
Full height windows overlooking lush greenery. In love with the view!
Friendly service staff too. Will definitely drop by again.
5
I love this place, the food's amazing, service and atmosphere is fantastic too, definitely value for money - highly recommended!
5
My family and i love the ambience. The foods served were awesome too! Great services and convenient location for the people living in the West sides.
5
A very intimate place with a good ambience. The furniture and decor are inviting. Wldnt mind coming again.
5
Wanted to get family members to have a nice dinner with great ambience and SPIZE @ Rifle Range did not disappoint. Food quality was great. Waiters could have been more attentive to clear dishes when required but other than that, great experience!
5
Spize (Rifle Range) is perfect for anyone who loves their food yet in an atmosphere perfect for any occassion. This was our 2nd visit in 3 months.
4
I love the atmosphere and the great service plus good food. Great for meet ups and chit chat. do make reservation especially for dinner and weekends.
Downside, its out of reach. you need to drive in. Choice of food as much as their other branches.
4
Dinner date for 2 at a cozy place which was not so noisy on a weekday.
Was a bit disappointed because not many choices for noodles. Perhaps adding Laksa or soup noodles would be great. Otherwise, food portions was just right.
4
Spize offers great variety in the menu to cater to different preference. The briyani is simply perfect. The ambience is also very relaxing and deor is very comfy. The only thing was the seating is abit too near to the next table and some of the chairs are too low for comfort. it is not very nice hearing the conversation of the next table. Other than that, service is alright. They could do with bigger cups for water. Love the fun atmosphere there. Mayve have more healthy options for food.
4
SpizeA halal certified restaurant. Other outlets in Bedok and River Valley.Serves Asian, Indian, Mediterranean food.Tried the lamb briyani because they ran out of the chicken briyani - lamb was tender, good taste.Fried Hor Funn (flat rice noodles) with wok fried sliced ribeye fillets - quite a large portion size for $13.90 - beef's very good.Brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a swirl of chocolate on top - slightly warm, slightly chewy - very good.Frosty longan and frosty lychee - both good @ $4.80 each. Found 3 longans at the bottom of the frosty longan. If you pay another $3 you will get the giant size one which is about 3 times the regular size. Good tasteThis is a good choice as there is a good variety of food, prices are reasonable, there is air conditioning, lots of space and kids can play just outside the restaurant. Also the view out of the clubhouse is great - see the pool and greenery. Easy and plentiful parking
5
Trip with family & daughter in law.
Pleasant experience. Prompt service. Food was served very fast after ordering. Food ordered was delicious. Exceptional for Hokkien Prawn noodle still very salty.
Special thanks to service staff Azlan for his prompt service and attentiveness.
2
It was so dry n burnt
Though brought it to the staff
He did not feel he still to get a replacement simply said will relay to the chef .. disappointed as I propose this place as a birthday venue.
5
what more could you ask for~!? (promotional menu wld be nice. heh.) staff - Karen was the best! great service provided.. she took care of us n our needs from the moment we sat down till the moment we walked out~! superb service.
5
Great place to eat chill and relax. But abit sqeezy. But overall all good. Food is good. Service quite fast
5
My family had breakfast on 2 April 2017. The food was of good portion. The service was friendly. Daria was polite & accommodating. The decor was really pretty. And the scenery was certainly a bonus.
5
Staffs was very friendly...nice place for gathering especially the sofa seats...my kids luv the sofa..
1
I booked the table for 8 at 6:30 expecting to spend a really nice evening with my colleagues one couple of whom had recently got married. When we arrived we were told we had to leave the table before 8:30pm as there was another booking for the same table. We rushed dinner and left by 8:15pm. It was not a great experience. If I knew we had to leave within two hours, I would honestly have booked somewhere else.
4
The restaurant has a great ambience with a good choice of food. They plate it up so pretty with flowers and such :) Reasonably priced and don't miss out on their ever so good desserts. Although it's a little out of the way, you may want to catch shuttles from King Albert's station to Temasek Club (learnt this from one of their chefs) ... not to sure on shuttle timings though
5
This has become our favourite dining place. One of the best in the west! Very accommodating.. Orders were promptly sent out.. Staffs were always listening to special requests.. Food never disappoints.. My dad as a retired FB manager even rated your steak meat as one the best in the market.. No loud unnecessary music.. One staff in particular ( big and bespectacled Malay guy) is always nice towards all guests
5
Ambience was good and clean. Service crews were friendly. Food were great. Our table of 7 ordered steak, truffle fries, aglio olio, penang fried kway teow and nasi goreng ayam. Everyone of us loved our food. It was a pity they do not have cakes because it was my mother-in-law and my husband birthday celebration.
4
Decided to give Spize another chance after the not so pleasant experience previously. This time I'm glad staff are more attentive and the service level has improved.
5
good food. food was never a disappointment. good service. friendly staff. my favourite place to eat with my family and friend.
5
Suffice to say the food was delicious. Ordered the Wagyu beef cooked to medium rare & it just melt in my mouth! Dinner was for party of 5 & everyone left smiling.
4
Nice view over looking the hill and pool. great and prompt service. Serves Asian, Western and fusion.
5
They are still as good as the last visit! Please keep up the good standard of food and services. Good job!
5
Great ambience, great food and great service! Love the atmosphere and location and service here has always been perfect.
4
Nice ambience. Love it. Food are good too. Recommended. Went to the place on sunday afternoon not crowded at all
5
The first time I was introduced to this eatery, I was impressed with the high level of service standard. The wait staff remained calm and friendly, even in the midst of the busy dinner service. As we were seated at a table in front of the open kitchen, I could see that all the kitchen staff knew what they were doing and things were run like clockwork. I was back here for breakfast today with a friend and the service was, once again, impeccable. The coffee this morning was delicious! The Long Black was robust and tastes of deep, dark chocolate. The great service, coupled with the wonderful view of tall trees and their swimming pool and tasteful furnishing, makes Spize an excellent place for a casual or romantic meal
4
Brought my kids over! They love the spacious place and nice view! Good place for families and celebration. Saw many elders or with wheelchair coming with their family. It's a good serene place, I will want to bring my grandma along too! The Food are good and we def love it very much.
5
Came here for a surprise V-Day dinner. The ambience is quite romantic with a touch of high-end restaurant but it's casual. So you don't need that proper attire to be allow entry. The food is delicious. Quite a variety with a twist rather than the normal spize menu at the other outlets. I had beef steak and it was done perfectly (medium rare). You know it's hard to find those that cooks your steak as you like. The burger is huge too! Love the mushroom soup. The price is average to me. Ok now the location can be quite a challenging. Since it's situated in Temasek Club, there's a free shuttle bus from clementi. Otherwise the nearest mrt is Albert Park Station and cab in for $5. Overall, definitely worth a come back.
5
1st timer at Spize (Rifle Range). Was amazed by the look, service and love the ambience. Will come again for any family event.
1
I like the set out of the restaurant - cool and comfortable. Hope the staff are more friendly and helpful. Most important, food must serve hot and not cold and even asked to reheat the food, it came as cold as ever.
4
This is located inTemask Club. The ambience is great and I love the western food. Price is reasonable
4
A big thumb-up for Spize. Beautiful ambience, excellent service and very affordable prices!!! staff are very friendly and make good suggestions from the menu.
5
Nice ambience and the food is above expectation. My family and I have been going to Spize rifle range for the third time already
5
The food was good, served relatively fast. Short waiting time. Staff were really polite. Thumbs up üëçüèª
5
The waitress is very prompt in attending to our needs.Very attentive. And she is always smiling despite being busy
4
If you're looking for variety of cuisines, this is the place. If you're looking for good ambience, this is the place. And yes, they over good services.
4
We came here for a discussion lunch. The view is fantastic, full length windows overlook a beautiful lush green forest. Food was good, I had the briyani rice, largely the Asian food spread was delicious. You can also order from this restaurant when you are at the pub area (halal restaurant has no alcohol) so you can feast on the stuffed chicken wings and other finger food.
4
We decided to try Spize for dinner and walked in without any reservation. It was pretty packed on Sunday night so expect to wait for a table. The girls had the spaghetti bolognese kids size which was quite a large portion. The Penang fried Kway Teow is totally no where close to the real stuff so won't recommend. The Nasi Goreng Kampong was good as well as the sambal belachan. The sticky truffles fries and fried chicken wing are both good. Wife had the steak wrap which was so so. Can recommend for a quick meal as the place is relaxed and no dress cod
4
Celebrated my birthday at Spize with a simple dinner gathering and quick witted staff surprised me w a lit candle on our waffles order upon learning of my birthday at the restaurant. Nice touch!
5
The food is great - fusion of Asian and Mediterranean. Great view of the pool and built timah too! Free shuttle to this place but must check the timing.
3
To get to temesak club is around 5 mins drive into the clubhouse.
Spize was packed for dinner, service was slow and food was not fantastic.
5
Atika, the sale and marketing manager together with her team have provided an excellence service. We enjoyed the lunch. Thank you very much!
5
The best truffle shoestring fries & nasi goreng kampung I ever had! Love the ambiance and wallet-friendly priced dishes.
1
Food delicious. Choices are limited. Fine dining concept.
Ambience cosy. Location secluded. Ideal for those with private transportation.
Price average for food, expensive for drinks.
Service - poor. Unattentive waitress and waiters.
1
Food delicious.expensive drinks. Ambience cozy. Location very secluded. Private transportation will be ideal to get to location.
Service needs alot of improvement. Unattentive staff. Staff busy gathering at Bar counter and infront of kitchen.
5
We were there to celebrate our mom's birthday. Service was good. Love the food and overall a great experience for the whole family.
3
table not ready even though booked 2 weeks in advance.
food slow to arrive
making enough for one hundred characters
3
Nasi Goreng is so hard. Dessert came late. A friend requested for a medium rare doneness on his steak. But it came medium well and the meat is so tough to consume.
4
Staffs were meticulous and patient in attending to the diners. The portion of food is ideal for per pax and ambience is superb.
5
Delicious food, fabulous setting, efficient & cheerful staff. I have been patronizing this joint for ample times, will return again for sure. No hesitation to recommend to friends.
4
Portion of food served was quite generous. Plating of food was tastefully done and food was pretty yummy especially the truffle fries. Wide selection on their menu
5
Good embience and food at a reasonable price. Very popular restaurant but lack of staff therefore don't expect good service
5
Loved the deco. Loved the ambience. Loved the food. So serene and peaceful when driving into the temasek club. Great service. Thank you.
4
This restaurant is surrounded by lush greens. Fantastic place for family and buisjbess gathering. Good ambience and service
5
The service was great. The personnel were polite and were very prompt in providing good service to us.
4
Really love the ambience.... Service was great too and food was really well presented. However, food is fine without being the main draw here.
3
When we came it was just too crowded on a week day lunch. So it was very noisey and we couldn't hear anyone above the noise. The hokkien Mee sounded so nice over the menu with a rich seafood broth - reality was not good enough. Waiters and waitresses were too busy so didn't have time to give us good service. In general everything was average and forgettable
3
Was the 3rd time in Spize but the previous times were for dinner in a large group. This time round just 2 of us for lunch. The reservation via Chope was great since reminders were sent to me via phone call and email and i got the seat by the window overlooking the pool. Due to the crowd i have to constantly stand up or go to the counter for attention to order my food or get my glass refill. All was great till another couple sat beside me with the woman trying to impress her partner and the man talking as loud as he was half-deaf. Their seats were so closed we felt we were in their conversation half the meal! I felt the space could be better managed in that sense.
5
The food is delicious and it is laid out enticingly. My mum was really pleased and she does look forward to come here again. Keep up the good work!
5
Had a company team dinner at Spize(Rifle Range). Great services from the staff and great tasting food.
3
The service staffs seems a little cold. Some of the staff is unfriendly. But the ambience is very nice.
4
The Philippino waitress was not attentive and gave me wrong orders of my juice even though repeated myself 3 times (including an instruction from the manager when he saw that she didn't understand what I wanted to order)
5
The food we ordered were all very tasty and delicious with generous portions! Highly recommended. Service is fast but could improve more on friendliness.
4
Many service staff but it's difficult to get their attention. All seem to be busy but in actual fact not sure what they are busy with cos they like to crowd round the bar counter and kitchen area with their backs facing the patrons.
4
Came to the place with my family to celebrate my mum's birthday. The atmosphere was calm and quiet as it was not a busy day. All of my family enjoyed the food too! Affordable for small gatherings with close ones.
3
I called the number on the website and was informed that the lunch menu begins at 10.30am. So I made reservations for 6 pax at 10.30am on a Saturday. When I arrived however, I was told that they will only start taking orders for lunch at 10.50am.Order was made but the food arrived about 35 minutes later. The food was good and the serving was generous. Worth the wait I guess.The ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant and beautifully decorated. Seats and tables were ready as per the reservation made.
5
Location of restaurant is quite secluded. Abit hard for those with no transport.However the place is very cozy and nice! Good and fast service from staff. Food is reasonably priced for a restaurant.Was there for a company function and no one had any complaints about the food. Desserts were awesome as well
5
The ambience was nice. The food served was pretty fast. Nice meal to have. Definately recommended. But for those that has no public transport will definately have an issue going there. Must have own transport or take a cab there. But it was worth the experience as the place is far from noisy places.
4
booked thru Chope. reservation recommended as place tends to fill up quickly. food was delicious and good. service is ordinary. looked understaff. Waiters were hurried, some grumpy. Atmosphere was great. Love the deco
5
A lovely place for get togethers. Good variety of food that caters to different tastebuds. Great place for big groups.
4
Nice presentation of food.
Worth the price.
My family enjoyed it much. Am sure to visit again.
Love the ambience.
4
Good food reasonable price. Service was average but understandable since it's a busy day for them. Otherwise, we really like dining at Spize (Rifle Range).
4
Food was good...
The chicken chop with onions and mushrooms was delicious!
Reasonably priced for this place.
The durian ice cream was simply yummy!
5
Warm ambience..service oriented..prompt in delivering service too..will not hesitate to make a return again..tis was my second time!
5
My friends and I had an enjoying lunch gathering at Spize. The portion and price of the food are reasonable.
5
It was this time of the year when most restaurants are busy with all the celebrations going on. We had our usual year end gathering with our former neighhours at Spize and the staff have been most cheerful and helpful in answering all our requests. Top it up with great food and that really make our gatherings a memorable one

This was the third time I patronize this Spize outlet. The ambience with the lush greenery as the backdrop just wows you. The food is generally pricier than other Spize outlets but this eatery has a fine dining aura to it. This is a great place to bring your family for the special occasion or to treat your colleagues to a good meal after a year of hard work.

The food were really tasty, service was amazing and ambience was good. Do note that there is shuttle service provided. However as the staffs also uses the shuttle, the place will be close in time for them to catch the last shuttle.. so the only setback was having to rush through my meal as I was there pretty late in the evening.. otherwise it is a highly recommended place. And the food is Halal
5
Excellent ambience,friendly staff and we enjoyed having lunch there as a family. Staff made a memorable birthday surprise for my husband by singing a birthday song. A day we will never forget.
4
Overall, it was an awesome experience from the reservation to the food. the food was served fast and importantly, delicious. the waiters were also attentive and provided recommendation. will definitely visit them again.
4
The restaurant set up is nice, casual and comfortable. Service staff are friendly and warm! Fantastic food selection!
4
Reasonably priced food which tasted good with good service. Also good ambience except for the accessible to the cafe itself. You can't get there without a car.
5
Hope to have more variety in menu, hope to have same menu as the other spize outlets in bedok or river valley but customer service excellent
4
Food is good and so is the service. Like the ambience - tucked in the middle of the "woods" :)
Definitely need to make reservations for big groups.

Very nice ambience with beautiful furniture and interior design. Located at a lush sanctuary amongst a nature reserve.Food was served in pretty crockeries and pleasing to the eye.Definitely up the ante as compared to the usual Spize experience However, one major drawback, staff seems to bark at you if you don't have RSVP over the weekends.There is this one particular senior gentleman who wasn't wearing his nametag, seemingly unapproachable, grumpy looking and quick to turn down.Pleasantly surprise to be served by Caucasians waitresses. Perhaps they seem overwhelmed by the weekend crowd, making them not smile my guess.Overall experience, 10% service charge was unjustifiable, however the whole experience was a pleasant one :

My hubby brought me here after having our spa nearby. It is quite difficult to find a restaurant with nice ambience, but the location of this restaurant has achieved it. Nicely renovated. The full length window has revealed its surroundings with forest behind and swimming pool below. Not very crowded and not much noise interruption. The food here served in "just nice" portion. Sausages with mashed potatoes, prawns and lamb racks with pumpkin all were nicely cooked and served with good representation. They tasted so yummy.There was a shuttle bus brought us to Clementi Interchange.I will definitely recommend and bring my friends here again.
4
Went for dinner. Nice ambience. There were a variety of food. The Mediterranean grill was good. Took lamb racks. Was a bit fatty. But my friends lamb racks were quite meaty. Guess it's down to luck. The salted caramel apple strudel was good. Waffle is nice too.
2
Nobody attended to us when we arrived even though there were many staffs who saw us. Upon leaving the restaurant, we noticed that they had given us the wrong bill and wrong change. Food was fantastic, but the service could have been better. Some of the staffs are really rude
5
Food can be better but service and atmosphere was great. The nasi goreng was abit too salty but the western items were good.
5
The selection of food was good from Asian to western. The ambience was pleasant.
However most not all of the serving staff cannot smile. It would be excellent if the service improve.
4
Food was good. The desserts - brownie + ice cream and waffle + ice cream & peanut butter - was awesome! Service could have been a tad more attentive and responsive though. Overall still a memorable and value for money experience.
4
Food is great. Seafood Aglio Olio is on the spicy side. Grilled chicken pesto is yummy. our children love the burgers. This place Is always crowded, best to make reservation before going.
4
Make an early reservation by the window, to have a great pool and vegetation view. Food is halal and great price.
5
Enjoyed our gathering of friends at Spize. Food was good and the ambience was great. Will be back to try out other dishes in the menu.
5
Such a nice place. The staff were so nice and helpful especially with the birthday surprise! Thank you so much
4
It was easy to make reservations to this restaurant using the Chope App. The restaurant was beautiful, clean and comfortable. Food was good and serving size was big, but could have more variety for the breakfast menu. They were also able to cater to my requests. As we were celebrating a friend's belated birthday, they offered a complimentary brownie with ice cream
2
I gave a two rating because of the pleasant ambience and one very delicious Nasi Goreng Tiga Rasa dish ! Sadly, it would have been an awesome dining experience, if my family and I have been welcomed properly to the restaurant. Given set of cutlery before or when our three dishes were served to us, without having us to ask for cutlery. We had to wait for another 10 minutes before any cutlery were sent to our table. The iced milo drinks that were served to us, were very diluted ! There was only one piece of ONE quarter slice of pita served with the hummus dish.We are very dissappointed, as it was to be our treat to our mother for her birthday.We sincerely hope the restaurant would look into the quality of service at this branch. Thank you for your attention.NOORMSAID

Food was good, value for money and the restaurant was nicely done up. The view from the restaurant out to the greenery was amazing - very few places in Singapore has a view like theirs. The staff was however run off their feet with the lunch crowd and service was not as good as I would like. Not bad I must say but could be better
5
food was good. there was abit of waiting time but i came in a big group of 20. the serving of food was just right and the ambience of the venue was very good.
5
I celebrated my 46th Birthday with my family.The food was very tasty and we really enjoy it.Hope we are able to come again next time in the afternoon where the atmosphere would be different
5
Excellent ambience! Awesome food and service. Great indoor dining place, find it convenient for those with little ones
5
Good place for lunch with the acceptable price.
The Asia food is variable standard. It was not so good as compare during my 1st visit.
4
Good ambience for a romantic dinner or catching up with friends. Food was delicious. May need a vehicle to drive in, otherwise, there's a shuttle bus. Will definitely come again!
2
The manager Kelvin Pereira needs to be re-trained on basic courtesy. His subordinate Magdelene deserves to be the manager instead of him. Magdelene was professional. Kelvin insisted that my family didnt make the lunch reservation. We were asked to leave by 4.30 pm! But we did make the booking. The way he approached us was rude! Shame on you Kelvin

Nestled among the greenery of Bukit Timah Hill is Temasek Club. And right at the entrance of the club is Spize, a nice cozy restaurant with affordable food prices. The restaurant overlooks the luscious rainforest and the bluish swimming pool. You can get five different varieties of food. Restaurant is halal. I personally liked it a lot.
3
The restaurant is located at the Temasek Club on Rifle Range, set among lush greenery. This is the senior officers club for the Singapore Armed Forces and its very nice. If you are seated by the window you get a stunning view of the swimming pool and the lush greenery.The restaurant's ambience is nice as well. Comfortable seating, with tables well laid out for couples and families.Food was mediocre. Normal restaurant fare. No signature dishes recommended either. But dessert was special. We had pancakes with an extra large scoop of ice cream topped off with marinated apple and berries. This was really good.For coffee we had Kopi Tareh - Singapore lingua translation for "pulled coffee." Very local and very special. Must try if you haven't already.Then came the experience spoilers - one three occasions other people's orders came to our table. Good thing my business host checked the bill, as someone else's order ended up on our bill. This was 50% of the total bill and a substantial sum. So not very nice, I we had not looked through the bill prior to paying. Took awhile for the service staff to sort this out. Kept asking us if we were sure these extra main courses were not our order. I wonder to which tables these dishes finally ended up at?? No manager or supervisor came to handle this issue. Things got quickly sorted out after my host asked if there was a manager on duty who he could speak too. Serving staff apologetic but still no appearance of manager or supervisor. Also, noticed that some serving staff after returning dirty cutlery to the kitchen came away munching food. Not so nice for guests to see.So, would I go back? Not likely. The food wasn't exceptional. The view was great but then good food and service are primary reasons. It was a business lunch and my host was uncomfortable with the way things turned out. Sorry guys- no cigar!!
4
The reservation was made on the same day and there was an automated call to confirm the reservation.A baby chair was requested in the reservation form and upon arrival, I have informed the staff. However, the baby chair never arrive which reflects the poor service in this aspect.The food is of reasonable price and the ambience is good. The burger was tasty but the penang kway Tiao has room for improvements. I didnt even know there is chilli in it. Good to have a chilli symbol beside the name of dish to indicate the amount of chilli presence.It will be good if the menu can include chef's recommendation and most popular dishes for consideration
2
When my friend arrive at the restaurant, it took like 5 mins before anyone comes forward to help her to our reserved table. We were given a table on a raised platform somewhat like a "stage" and I didn't notice the steps and trip over badly, knocking my forehead on the table next to mine. None of the staff came to help nor ask if I am ok. Instead guests on nearby table helped me up. After like 5 mins, one male staff came and ask if we want to order. I told him I had a bad fall and they should have come forward to help. His crude and dry reply was:"I didn't see it". No concern or offer of water whatsoever. Shocking and horrible attitude. Our lunch was ok but I must say the staff needs to get better training and understand the consequences if any of their guest injured in their premises and they didn't come forward to help or understand the situation.
4
I enjoy the view and the food. The ambience was very calm and both me and my friend enjoy the peaceful breakfast.
5
Really enjoyed the Mediterranean food and ambience at Spize@ Rifle Range. Good Service too!Especially enjoyed the Truffle Fries and salad.
Gelato was great tasting too!
5
Always a lovely dining experience at Spize rifle range rd. Ambience during Sunday lunch, if you arrive before 12.30pm, is very serene and airy. It gets a little crowded by 2pm. Food is as expected. Always served hot and consistent in flavour. Never disappointed.
4
It was my first time eating at Spize and they had a good range of items. Local food to Mediterranean. I tried the Shish Kebab which was tasty but a little under cooked.
4
Very nice ambience and food was a good fusion of local and western. Location have plenty of parking space as well.
4
Visit was during the peak period. Restaurant was nearly full. Service was not tat good. Food was good. Its spize but atas version
4
newly renovated Temasek Club, nice ambience, a little too small place as there is a large crowd specially during weekend, however great food (halal) and good service.
5
I've patronised Spize at Rifle Range Rd 3 times, and the food and service has been fantastic each time. I've tried the burger, wrapz, briyani and other local dishes. The fried chicken cutlet is to-die-for and comes in a big portion. Spize is getting busier and it's advisable to get a reservation through CHOPE.
5
Found this gem hidden in Temask Club (Rifles Range). Even though, restaurant situated within clubhouse, but this is open to public. Extremely popular with families crowd so should make early reservation. Tables can cater to big families...we went as a extended family of 16pax! If you go for lunch or early dinner, ask for seats near the window, looking into the green forest. Rare view in spore. Totally relaxing! There is also free shuttle bus to nearby MRT station. You can actually play bowling (open to public too), thereafter, dinner feast! Halal restaurant
4
really love the ambience of this place. Felt that the food tasted reasonable and price was reasonably, but more importantly the place is really good for groups, not too crowded and conversations could carry on with ease. Would also like to commend the staff there for being prompt and friendly. Second time here already and would definitely return again
5
Food was good and portion big. View overlooked the swimming pool.
Some of the service staff has attitude problem but some are friendly and smiley.
5
Is a birthday celebration for my friend. Overall, all is happy. The food served is nice. Service staff is courteous.
4
Great decor and yummy food. Fast service and value for money. Perfect for a casual business lunch as well as a relaxing family meal on the weekends.
4
Great place for quiet family dinner. Affordable good quality food. Excellent service. Have more items on dessert menu please.
5
Beautiful ambience both for family & a couple day out. Food was fantastic but would be great if there was a wider range of mains. However, will definitely come again! ‚ô°
4
Confirmation on my reservation is fast reliable and easy. Any changes I will just have to make call to the restaurant and they have my records.
4
Good experience. foods are nice. we have a great time. Kids love the ice-cream . Will visit another time to try other foods
4
The rack of lamb was delicious, however, the lamb briyani was a letdown. Too little lamb in the dish.
3
Food was mediocre. Food took a while to arrive, and by the time the last person was served, some in the party were almost done. Request for special corner for cozy birthday treat was not looked into, although some quiet corner was available. Table of 6 was given for 7, hence it was quiteAlso additional charge for change of dome ingredients was not made known till bill time, and although the poor waiter was apologetic and tried to waive it off, his superiors declined.
4
We went there for a friend's birthday lunch. The food was great and the portion is generous. The atmosphere was great as well.I've ordered the Fried Chicken Chop and it's really tasty. The only cons is it's not easily accessible unless you have a car
4
Second time here. The menu was varied and the food was tasty and service crew was polite and helpful! The ambience was cosy and had a classy feel. The pasta was excellently al dente! Overall a good place to dine! Will certainly revisit!
4
Temasek Club's Spize is good with the quality of their food. It would have been better if there are a little more waiter/waitresses around as I shudder to imagine if Spize is full-housed.
5
We made booking at 6pm and its not easy to be on time when u have big group of people. We were given great service eventhough we r late. Staff is very friendly...
4
Food was great,atmosphere was awesome but wish they paid more attention to the 2 heavily pregnant ladies in my grp, instead of pushing them from one staff to another to attend to them.
4
Cozy Restaurant. Very Attentive Servers. They are more than happy to give you their views and recommendations. Overall good experience.
4
The food is quite good. However the sides selection is limited. The restaurant is really nice and the location is quiet. But you gotta drive in.
4
Tucked away in thr lush forests of rifle range road...this little gem of a restaurant is jam-packed with a menu that is bursting at its seams for variety. Ambience is perfect for business lunches and quiet evenings for couples. Will definitely be back.
5
I have only ever gone to the Spize at River Valley Road and so was pleasantly surprised by this one at the Temasek club. There are the same favourites like Nasi Goreng Ayam Kunyit and what I love having there, their Teh Halia. The decor and view is great. A very good place to bring family and kids. I'll happily return.
4
Restaurant serving a variety of dishes from local delights to international cuisines, beers and wine. Average price per diner is about $25 -$30, business starts from 0830H daily (serving breakfast). Shuttle bus transport available at designated pick up and drop off points. Parking available at nominal charge. Restaurant can be remote for some, if you are not driving
2
Visited this place in a group of eight.The ambiance is indeed beautiful as the place overlooks the swimming pool, and the interior of the restaurant is very nicely decorated.Food wise was not too bad, except that, we encountered 4 servings of the grilled seabass fillet that had a foul smell and putrid after taste.It was only after much convincing the staff on duty that they allowed us to switch to other foods.The argument by the staff was that their seabass fillets were all freshly delivered on the day itself, and were therefore fresh. However, the staff failed to understand that delivery on the same day does not equate to freshness, as the fillets could be stored longer then a day prior to delivery, and that there could be something wrong with their cold chain supply that could have caused the quality of the seabass fillets to have turned bad.The matter should have been better looked into.
4
Customer service was excellent! Took the time to explain the menu and kept my kids in check with the utensils use for kids.
5
Great place and food Very good services. However, parking charges are too expensive considering the location.
5
Tried the portobello burger with truffle fries, schiracha chicken burger & pesto sundried tomato toast. All were superbly delicious. And we got beautiful window seats overlooking the nature reserve & pool!
5
The food and the people serving us were awesome and the view was stunning ! Definitely something to come back for !
5
Food was serve promptly, great service and wide range of dishes to choose from. Would visit again to try the ice cream
4
Despite our big party, all our orders came through and food was good. Kids enjoyed their meals and waffle ice cream cones!
5
The food is yummy and value for money. It is the first time I brought my sister there and she said she will definitely visit again.
5
Food slightly pricey than the ones at Simpang Bedok. However nice ambience and helpful staff. Food was ok.
4
Even though our food came late for iftar (breaking fast) it was expected and understandable due to full house capacity. Service was good. Serving crew were apologetic due food order came late. Ambience was great. Food was awesome. My third visit but definitely coming back for more. 2 thumbs up!!
3
Located at the Temasek Club (a club for army officers), you'll expect prices to be cheaper. After all, I'll imagine they enjoy much cheaper rents than commercial areas in town. But the price isn't competitive at all. The food served is a tad better than average, just like what you'll expect from other Spize outlets. The ambience is not bad too. But I won't recommend this place.
3
Ambience is good, but the service could have been better. The staff were unfriendly and snobbish. It wasn't packed, but no one was attending to us. The service we had from Spize River Valley is so much better than this.
5
Is an excellent place for gathering and price is reasonable. Service was good and we enjoy our dinner very much. Highly recommended!
4
Service was good. Food was served timely. Staff was friendly. Prices was not too expensive. Generally a nice place to have dinner with friends
4
My third time here in two weeks and everyone I brought loved the food. I especially enjoyed the lamb briyani and waffles. Sunday nights can get crowded though, they only take walk-ins and waiting time is 30-40 minutes
4
Love everything about the place except the quality of the food. Maybe because we were there for breakfast.
5
Even though the location is quite secluded the restaurant is nicely furnished and service was good as staffs were very friendly. Food tasted as good as what u can get at all the other spize outlets.

location - in the quiet forest area of Rifle Range Road, this place is a pain to go to via public transport but there may be shuttle bus which i am unknown to. with own transport, let this place teleport you to the serenity of SG's initial roots, a jungle, green city.staff - politeness is there but the gesture of pointing me to my seats by a server who has his lips stuck on his strawed drink leaves much to be desired. as location was empty, chitter chatter was plenty @ 11am.premise - its nice. its beautiful. well designed. can get a tad close with table neighbours when busy i reckon. the decor was sweet as!!! how your now atypical cafes in SG are looking like.food - affordable chic. coffee was average but the mocha was spot on. the food was very pocket friendly when compared to other places but their use of ingredients is smart - using basic components and making it look like it should cost a bomb - pretty food. The all day breakie was good but the croque madame, not so.pricing - very pocket friendly and at the price that its being served, reasonable. given the place and surroundings, the competition has that lacking. smart move if you ask me. overall - besides from location (without own transport) this place has a good future in this location. am sure it is busy in weekends and for couple who want the ambiance for dinners, this place is a good-to-go (sans privacy due to proximity of 2 seaters) will come again in very near future to try the mains
4
This is a Halal Restaurant in Temasek Club opened to public in a cosy setting with reasonably priced Kampong Fried rice and other rice variety. There is a also a good selection of ice-cream for dessert. Try the banana shake and steak! Average of S$13 per pax. Only issue is water will not be topped-up automatically in your small disposable plastic cup. You'll have to self-service at times
4
This outlet of Spize is near the house so it's quite handy for me. Apart from that, the food is great. We have been there at least six times times in the recent months for both lunch and dinner and it has never disappointed. I always make it a point to try new dishes at each visit though I must say, I do always order their wraps in addition to the new dishes. The wraps are really tasty and are good value meals, in particular the chicken and the beef with cheese. YUMMMMM!! The only downside of this restaurant is, you can't expect your food in a hurry. As it is a popular outlet, the waiting time can be up to half an hour. Do always make a reservation. Count yourself lucky if your food arrives before 20 minutes is up. As a frequent visitor, I don't fuss and am prepared to wait a little longer than the average cafe as I know what I'm waiting for is going to be good. However, this cannot be construed as being acceptable especially at lunch time when we have to get back to work. I hope they will take note nad up the ante on the speed of service.And, by the way, their drinks tend to be a little pricey as compared to the food items
4
The venue was awesome, good for corporate gathering or special celebrations :)The menu is not as extensive as the ones they offer in their other outlets. But food was good and very presentable. Came here with my colleagues, and we thought that it took quite a while for our food to arrive. Loved the waffles and selection of gelatos esp the salted caramel ice cream!Would come back again for the nice ambience :
