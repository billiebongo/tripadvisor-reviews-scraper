Great food with great service! Awesome way to spend a night with friends with a charming atmosphere.

I love this friendly and honest place. Excellent food and attentive service, the owner is charismatic and accommodating. Good choices of antipasti, pasta and pizza in a well-kept environment. Try the tiramisu!

We came to East Coast branch for dinner. Great food. We ordered pastas and pizzas as main. The people around were very nice except the Chinese staff who tried so hard to sell the tbone. When we said, today main course no meat, maybe another day. He just shrugged it off and left. And when we asked him for water refill, 3 times he ignored us - even after making eye contact. Hey we still need water as we ordered a few glasses of red wines....to temper down the alcoholic nature of wine and avoid dehydrating the body. No, you won’t get us back
4
This was my second time at Etna, after hearing about it from several friends.The food is really authentic, and at a reasonable price for the quality. Service is also tops.They have a wide ranging menu featuring antipasto, salads, pasta and pizza, as well as meat and seafood. Everything tastes great!The restaurant is small, do be sure to make reservations in advance
3
Went to try the T-bone Steak because a friend said it was very good. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I really felt very disappointed with the meal. The steak was almost tasteless! I wonder if they use frozen meat. I should have asked them for the source of beef but I was too disappointed to even ask. The calamari was great, though. So maybe this restaurant is better for their seafood but definitely thumbs down for steak. We ordered medium but half the portion came out rare to medium rare.
5
The food to say the least, is fantastic...We ordered a salad... TOP quality greens, perfectly balanced. We could taste the freshness.Two pastas... the ravioli with pistachio sauce is unique and a must try... the second was a spaghetti alio oli with fish.... nice but in my opinion couldn’t match the ravioli.Panna cotta for dessert is presented beautifully. A cold white chocolate dome covering the panna cotta with a citrus coullis. Warm chocolate poured over the white. The flavours are just simply great.Wine recommendations were very good and combined with warm friendly service, my impressions were visit again for a great evening.This place has all the ingredients for a good evening with family, friends..

Etna has a very interesting menu and we were very excited about dining there with friends. The staff had good wine recommendations to go with the meal, and that was one of the few pluses. We ordered the Burrata to start with, and mains were Ravioli (Vegetarian) and the Sicilia Pizza, and a bottle of the Etna Rossa. The Burrata was pretty good - the cheese itself was exactly way the way it should be. The mains portions were off - 4 pieces of Ravioli didn't really cut it, and the Pizza was bland. The service started to get pushy after a point of time when we didn't want dessert but were still on the wine. Quite disappointing in all
5
I don't just mean the food. It's also the robust Italian hospitality coupled with genuine concern about whether you're having a good time. The service is impeccable yet unobtrusive, which is a very fine line to draw and Etna does it well.There's always at least one server/manager/cook who is Italian born and bred and can give a little bit of history about the food you're having. Different parts of Italy have slightly different nuanced cuisines and depending on season, you can get a flavour of the different italys available. The menu doesn't change but the board specials are always different. The pastas are delicately flavoured. The meats savory.Highly recommended
5
it was a last minute decision to have our 15 years wedding anniversary dinner in the east closer to our home due to a busy day at work and our experiences at Etna that evening proven to be the best decision made.the waiting staff are on alert all the time, re-filling our glass water and our wine glass. my son enjoyed his pizza and out T-bone steak was a really delicious, tender and juicy. Tuna salad as the starter - amazingly fresh and delicious
5
This well presented restaurant was a real surprise for my Wife and I. Rarely do you get such a great reception with gluten free requests. The waiter was very responsive and happy to oblige with offerings and suggestions. They had gf pasta on offer also. For those not vegetarian there was a great range of food also. The cheese was amazing and the anti pasta platter very attractive. The food was excellent, the service professional and relaxed. They managed our large group and caters well for the family group nearby without a blink. Highly recommended for some who are missing quality Italian food.
5
Next to Da Luca, Etna is my other go to Italian restaurant. I'm always satisfied and food is always excellent!
5
Benjie recommended this and is definitely fabulous...the location is great specially for nearby residents. Great for special occasions. Must prepare to wash yr hair after dinning though, the smoke for grilling do not exhaust well...
5
Love the food at Etna. Is another favorite Italian place next to Daluca. Their specials are always delicious.
4
A couple friend recommended that we celebrate my brthday dinner at Etna . The evening started well with the wonderful service of Benji who recommended us 2 appetizers ( prosciutto and seafood soup) to share and the T bone steak which was done exactly how we wanted and of the right amount too ( medium rare) tog with a pizza which was topped with very fresh and generous helping of ham! The tirumisu was excellent too!
5
Being able to enjoy alfresco dining with our pet was the reason we ended up here. But the food and service was awesome! Yummilicious Italian food with attentive and friendly staff will definitely see us going back to try their other dishes... Great to have a lovely Italian restaurant in the vicinity.
5
It is an excellent italian restaurant. The rib was by far the best I have ever eaten! The restaurant is very clean and beautiful. There is a very good wine menu and do not forget to try the limoncello after your meal. The waiters are very attentive for giving suggestion for food and explain about the menu wine. It was my birthday and they sang happy birthday to me with a delicious TiramisÃ¹. Lorenzo gave me and my parents the best service we have ever had since we came to Singapore. We intend to come back more times for dinner at Etna
1
2 X pizza (1 X Napoli without mozzarella and 1 X tuna pizza) + 1 X bottle of sparkling water = S$ 68.50. We will never go back to eat in this place! We have never paid so much for 2 pizza and a bottle of water!!
5
Loved the lamb shank + burrata. This place is almost always full so it is good to make reservation in advance if you want to sit inside. However, we have managed usually to get places outside which is fine as well. The staff is very friendly and the food is very good (although a bit pricey).
5
You can easily overlook this restaurant from outside, however, the food and the service there are worth entering. Don't forget to order schiacciata, their amazing bread with truffles and mascarpone - it melts in your mouth and it's almost as good as pizza! (Sorry pizza lovers)The truffles risotto was at its best as well. Etna is located quite far, especially when you are not from East Coast but give it a chance, you won't be disappointed
4
We visited this place a few months back. We are not much into Italian cuisine and struggled a bit with the dishes' names. Our waiter was quick to notice this and helped us in the order. Also, the staff is very well trained and treat the customers very diligently. Regarding the food, I don't really remember what we ordered, but we enjoyed the fresh pizza and wine. However, I can recall that there was one particular dish that really tantalized our taste buds. In the menu its titled as Margherite al Pistacchio(had to check their online menu for this). Further, the tiramisu was just perfect. I would admit we didn't want any dessert, but our waiter praised it so nicely, we had to give it a try! No wonder, it was exceptional. The ambience is pleasant with simple decor. Altogether, we enjoyed the food and hospitality; an evening well spent
4
So this is at East Coast so it looks like a nice neighbourhood restaurant. They had a nice set lunch for under SGD30. Good if you are in the area but not worth driving out for.
5
I really enjoy Eating at Etna; I've never turned up with a reservation yet the staff are always accommodating and pleasant. The food is is really good and fresh; everything is done to a high standard. Try the Mushroom, Sausage and Truffle Pasta, it's amazing!!
5
Every table enjoying the meal, couples and families. Birthday dinner & anniversary + us, the casual diners. Great food, wonderful service & happy diners.
Ps: better book - very busy restaurant
5
Another visit to Etna - cannot get enough of it. Again best food and service in town. Been here 4 times, the previous one was just last Thursday. So that's sufficient evidence how fantastic the food and service are.
3
Read on line they did a decent lasagna. When it came it was more of an appetiser size. We don't eat large portions normally but the size of the mains left us wanting more.
4
Great local restaurant in the East Coast and the same standard as on Duxton Rd. Staff and service were consistently good and nice to share stories about Italy and its wine & food. The wine list is ok with the best options in the red Italian wines. Singapore prices though so no good value. A descent wine will easily be $85 and up. Food was great throughout. In the end we spent about $450 for four people with two drinking alcohol.I'll definitely be back but as it's not cheap it will be for special occasions instead of random midweek dinners
5
What and awesome gem to find so close to where I live! My Friend and I were greeted with a warm welcome, including fresh breads and oils. Then a little explanation of the specials on offer and they did not disappoint let me tell you! I had the bruschetta to start, scampi risotto for mains and an oozing chocolate lava cake for desert. Outstanding and will most definitely be going back
5
We used to consider this just 'our local pop in restaurant' but over time this has become a bit more special. Having experienced most of the Italian restaurants in Singapore like Osteria, Fratini La Trattoria, No Menu, this really is right up there in terms of consistent high quality and service (both are difficult to get consistently in Singapore). Yes, you pay more, but not to a point of poor value. Because of its East Coast/Siglap location it is less pricey that the CBD/MBS located equivalents and less ostentatious. But the food and the service is definitely at least as consistent. The Burata has never been less than 'wow'. The salted sea bass has always been spot on. The wine selection is never blatantly upsold. In fact, on one special occasion, based on our food choice, I was redirected to our usual red which is more than acceptable! As opposed to the 40% uplift in the Amarone I was considering. Overall I can't think of a downside having visited Etna probably more than 50 times I have not yet had a mediocre experience.
4
Discovered this decent Italian restaurant along the East Coast Road which serves authentic Italian/Sicilian foods.Ordered the clam/mussels in white wine sauce, rocket salad and the special fish of the day - airflown from Italy seabream over dinner for two.Was pleasantly surprise by the quality and the taste of the food. The clam/mussels was done just right with flesh still soft and juicy and the white wine sauce was fabulous.The rocket salad dressed with light balsamic vinaigrette, orange, walnut and almond flakes was very refreshing and appetitising.The main of the 700g seabream grilled to the right crispiness and yet have the flesh still fresh and juicy was just fantastic. The accomplishment of cumbers, aubergine, potatoes and carrots made the dish very palatable. The serving portion was just right for two to share. Had the tiramisu with crushed pistachio topping and it was a perfect ending to such a wonderful dinner. Will definitely revisit again to try the rest of the menu such as the pizzas and pastas which looks just delicious when it was served to other diners sitting nearby
4
We went to Etna again for dinner and the pizza was really good. The 2 pastas - one vegetarian one and a ravioli were nice but perhaps a bit under seasoned. We were very happy to get a big container of chilli flakes when requested!)The prices are a bit on the high side but given the ambience and service, it is a nice place to visit some times
4
Kids loved the pizza , it was delicious and crispy thin, generous fillings and super fast served, ideal for hungry kiddos and the ambience is super nice
4
Etna may be located at the East Coast of Singapore, but a meal here easily makes you feel like you're in Italy. The service is top notch and the food delicious. Absolutely worth a visit!
5
Am a regular at Etna. Lovely fresh food home cooked Italian food and extensive wine menu. Great service!! Never disappointed.
5
Awesome food and great services ! Took a while to decide what we wants to eat with so many great choices recommended by the waiters . Will definitely come back for more !!!!
4
One of the better find dining places. Good food. A little cramp in terms of space. But highly recommended.Would urge anyone in the area to try it out.
5
I'm there almost every other month. friendly service staff remembers u n ur orders. simple n yet great italian fare
5
Great place to enjoy some good old Italian food with very prompt service. We were a group of 12 people and the restaurant arranged a long table to accommodate us, but service to each person remained meticulous.
4
Enjoyed our family meal at Etna and was very happy with the good service. Our glasses were never left empty and the food came out speedily and efficiently. I can see why this is a popular place for the neighbourhood. Although a tad bit pricey in comparison to our day to day hawker meals that Singapore is famous for, the cosy ambience, good food and good service makes it all rather worth it. Suitable for couples and families. Had an enjoyable experience and will look forward to heading back again
5
The wine list is fine. The thin pizza is outstanding. The tiramisu is exceptional. I am Italian and really really picky. The wait staff are marvelous, attentive, and genuine. When you ask for extra oregano and dry chillie flakes, you actually get them in small containers to sprinkle on your dish. While we have been twice for pizza we are going to try some other dishes the next time.Convenient location in Siglap. Easy access from Tanah Merah station to Siglap. Near the Siglap South Community Center
5
One of the best food and wine combinations with amazing service. The food was just the right seasoning and just the right type.Ordered the pork ribs and sauteed baby vegetables with bbq sauce was an amazing sensory journey.Prices are not for the faint hearted but when you throw peanuts you get monkeys and this place is for the keeps and keep going back kind.If you appriciate good food, a quite meal and personalized service you are in for a experience worth treasuring.Ask for lorenzo he know his wines and is very helpful
4
Easily one of the better places to get Italian food in Singapore a very good experience thanks to the great food and courteous staff
5
Great Italian restaurant with good service , amazing black truffle risotto e pistachios tiramisu'.We will be back soon for sure
5
One of the finest and authentic Italian restaurant. The Italian chef went out of the way to serve us customized vegetarian dishes. Go with the chef's recommendations as they were really good . And obviously it was not pocket friendly . A definite choice for fine dine Italian 
5
It's a bit of a treck out east from the city but worth it. Food is always excellent as is the service. The group chef was around so looked after us. He picked a dry white from scilly thst was superb and not expensive. I went for the very expensive risotto which looked crazily priced but was totally superb rich yellow with saffron and bone marrow. We had a good red too. It's pretty expensive but very high quality food.
5
We had a reservation for a table of eight; booking is advisable as this popular restaurant can be quite packed for dinner. Wine and food suggestions were spot on and every item we ordered was excellent; the lamb shank and the caprese salad were particularly outstanding
3
When Etna opened a quite a few years ago it was fantastic. Had amazing staff, a wonderful menu (for suburban Singapore) and good prices. Then they got rid of some of the local staff and bought in Italians. I think service dropped, the menu got far less accessible and prices went well up. I am probably wrong as its busy most nights of the week, but I don't love i
5
Don't be fooled by the relatively unpretentious interior: The food at Etna is probably the best Italian fare you can find in Singapore. Be prepared: Prices are fine-dining like, so a dinner here is not cheap. The service is genuinely cordial, another reason why this is a place we like to visit. Make sure to get a reservation in advance as Etna is usually full. There is Insight and outside seating available. We have only visited the restaurant at Upper East Coast Road so cannot comment on the other one which is located at Duxton Hill
5
We come here every other month because the food is consistently good and more importantly, the service staff are simply wonderful. Such a homely atmosphere. The florentine steak is a Favourite, well charred and medium rare, just the way we like it. Pizza, thin and crispy - great choices of toppings. Board specials such as the burr aroma with Parma, rocket and tomatoes - perfect appetiser to share. Dessert - don't forget the pistachio gelato, I only discovered this in the last couple of visits. One of the best gelato tasting of the real stuff
2
I went to the East Coast outlet for dinner, and had quite high expectations. The waiter was friendly but quite reserved. I ordered the Italian lemonade, but it was far too sour for my taste. It took over an hour for the food to arrive, although this is understandable because it was very busy that day. The starters, when they finally arrived, weren't too bad. The main disappointment was the diavola pizza, which we usually get at every Italian restaurant. It had a peculiar taste, and it wasn't just the salami; the entire pizza was 'different'. The meal was also quite expensive, especially the drinks
3
I tried this restaurant and its Duxton Hill counterpart within the space of a month, ordering some similar dishes, so it was easy to make comparisons. Without a doubt the Duxton outlet was better on food. The same pizza we tried here was too "watery". The seared squid was as delicious as ever. Pasta aglio olio which we requested as pretty good. However the mixed Sicilian seafood stew I had was horrible, with inferior ingredients. Corkage is $30 per bottle.
5
Our 2nd visit to Etna Italian Restaurant, Siglap outlet. The service, food and wine is fantastic. The t-bone steak is a must have. Very friendly staff. Made us feel at home. Will definitely come again and again.
5
My hubby and I love the food here. The pasta and pizzas are simply divine and the service is attentive and good.
4
Good food, BUT all tables are too close together, restaurant is too crowdy and certainly not a place to have an intimate meal with yur partner with the next table less then 2 inch from yurs.
Food is excellent though
4
Love the burrata cheese, awesome pizza, mains (we had the pasta, pork chop and lamb shank) and dessert. A restaurant we will definitely go back to.
4
The food is really great esp the pizza but when it's crowded - more food orders I assume.. The ventilation can get rather nasty.
Despite that I will make a trip back but request to sit at the outdoor area instead ;)
4
This place is one of the nicer spots you can have Italian food on in the East. Great wine selection and pastas as well. Definitely worth the try
4
Etna has a more upmarket branch in Duxton Hill but this original shop in East Coast is more neighbourhood in nature albeit it has white table cloth.No on-site car park so you have to uber or park in neighbourhood roadside.The food was good and service to match.Average pasta cost around $25. My angel hair lobster was $48. Dessert was around $15.Hard to find nice place to eat in the east and this is one of them
4
We stumbled across Etna while looking for lunch options in the East on Sunday that would be open till later in the afternoon - a rarity. Etna was a Godsend and OMG that Burrata was so good! The portion was generous and so fresh! The pastas were okay but not something that would blow your mind either. I rated the place highly because of the staff who were attentive and didn't kick a fuss for us dropping by that late
1
Rude with bad service from the waitress . Was having dinner with my Sister in law. We ordered 3 dishes, starter , pizza and main dish , beef. Starter and pizza was ok. But to our disappointment beef was very salty. Basically the beef just tasted salt and our tongue was numb by the salt . When we told the waitress the beef was too salty . She rudely told us off that , they tasted the beef in the kitchen, it was absolutely nothing wrong with the beef . She go on telling us ,that if we don't take Salt, we have to let them know ahead that no salt added on the beef. I was so shock with her comment . This is not the first time I am eating beef . Of course , to grill beef , u added with some salt to taste it better . But Not to cover the whole steak or beef with salt . Unless the beef is bad or Not fresh that u basically covered the whole beef with salt , as what we are being serve . What she trying to tell us, is the way the food being serve . U orders what u eat, even is bad, is your fault and nothing wrong with the cooking even is it bad. Such a bad food with bad service . I will never go back to the restaurant and would not recommend anyone to dine there. Even with bad food , you have to accept it and eat it . Coz this is what u ordered 
5
My friend and I came here particularly for the burrata and we were not disappointed (though the pastas are nice too)! Served with arugula and prosciutto, the combination of flavours were heavenly and the burrata was to die for. Great for a couple of friends to share (it was only the 2 of us... we didn't expect the burrata to be so huge!)
4
Was brought here by business colleague. Nice cosy restaurant, and we had a good appetizer of cheese and ham, and I tried the Angel hair capellini with lobster. Also tried the T-bone steak which was very good
5
My first visit to the restaurant and my family and I love the food.
Good food and service! Specially love the burrata and prosciutto.
Will definitely go back again since it's just a stone throw away from my place ;)
4
Great food and reasonable price. Generally they do not accept table booking on weekends. You have option to dine indoor with air conditioning or at the terrace with fresh air.
5
Good food and excellent service. Excellent recommendation of wine. Cosy restaurant. No regrets having our anniversary dinner here.
4
Very good service nice starched white table clothes.
Daily specials always good. I had a superb pasta with oxtail. Wine list good but aa always tad exp.
Not busy at lunch times so good for meetings although a bit far out of town.
3
We've been here twice and each time are left thinking it could have been better. The pizzas are very good but the other items we've tried lacked the bold flavours u expect from Italian cuisine. Easily surpassed by its sister restaurant in Duxton and others in the CBD
5
One of the finest Italian restaurant I have been to in the recent times in Singapore. Lip smacking fresh mozzarella cheese directly imported from Italy - so fresh and so tasty! Would highly recommend you to try that out here. I am vegetarian - but had good choice to chose from menu. I would love to visit this place as often as I can
5
My Friends took me to this Italian restaurant, its in a good neighbourhood so its regular with locals. Had good suggestions by the team leader and she knew what my friends liked and not and suggested very good food. Had Burrato Salad, Pistachio Ravioli which were something amazing, would recommend to have it
3
The food here is pretty good, as is the service. It's quite a small and intimate eatery and the lady chef often came out to greet her regular customers. Nick, our server, was attentive to each table and the other staff quicky topped up water etc without being asked.Timing between courses might be longish, especially if the place is crowded, but the food is certainly worth waiting for. We had the Pizza Marinara, which was on a nice, thin and crispy crust. There were five fresh and nicely cooked clams in their shells and the slightly spicy tomato sauce was full of minced garlic (too much so, we thought, when the dish arrived at the table) but it all worked together. I had expected marinara sauce to have seafood like squid and prawns but the pizza was delicious the way it was - so much so that my wife kept picking off my plate.When the risotto was served, It looked like an omelette as it was rather yellow but it was also a tasty dish. The proscuitto bits could have been crispier though but that was the only negative of the dish. My farmer's salad was done nicely, with sliced hard boiled eggs at the bottom of a mound of fresh arugula and lettuce leaves, in a balsamic dressing that was just right. The croutons tasted a day old and were hard, and the bacon bits could have been crispier here too, but that are minor issues.My wife had the mushroon soup, which she said was flavourful and rich. Dessert was ice cream served with coffee or tea.All in all, it was a tasty meal and we will certainly return to try other dishes on the menu
4
Etna Italian Restaurant is one of the many good Italian restaurants you can fine in Singapore and my dining experience at Etna was very memorable. The food as definitely very authentic and fresh from the seafood they cooked and served. Etna Restaurant has a warm cozy setting and the attentiveness of the service staff is commendable. We tried their parma ham pizza, seasoned calamari appetiser, caesar salad, beef lasagna, tiramisu and amaretto on the rock and love how it was prepared prepared and served. Will visit Etna again
5
A great place for a bite to eat with Italian charm and a good cook. Friendly atmosphere, and as for the price it is on the border but still acceptable.In any case recommend for dinner.
3
Fine Dining option, but very highly priced for the quality of food serviced. Ambiance is good. Not much variety of dishes
5
Have eaten here a few times when visiting from uk. Went this time with daughter and son in law who live in Singapore. Food always so good service very good. We love this restaurant!!
4
A cosy small Italian restaurant on the main road of Upper east coast road command even half of its restaurant on weekdays.A happy atmosphere brightly litted with cheery attentive service.Its beef carpaccio is served raw and thinly sliced with pamgiano cheese and rockets is a goid starter at S$24.A linguine pasta is done Al dente with crabmeat and soft shell crab is served in lobster bisque and is very delicious and satisfying.Their home made pork sausage with mushroom with truffle paste and mozzarella was done moist and crusty on the outside. All with Porcini beer goes down real well.To end the Italian dinner we had the tirimisu which is soft and creamy.A good satisfying meal of S$101 will certainly satisfy our return
4
Been eating here 3-4 times a year for the last 10 years. The service has always been warm (read about other reviews on their service issues) but it has never happened to me, and I am not that regular a patron. On the main road of Upper East Coast Rd, it is easily accessible by buses (10,12,13,14,16) or cars. Food is consistently good. Burrata w San Daniele prosciutto is a fave, as is Ricotta & Spinach ravioli. Pistachio tiramisu is delicious (although I swear that the portion has decreased). If you are dining between 6.30 to 8.30 pm, reservations are highly recommended, whether on weekdays or weekends as this is located in a residential area). You hv a better chance of dining here without prior reservation if you are planning a late dinner.
3
To me the rating is just slightly more than average but not to the extent of very good. We started with Parma Ham with rock melon (which most people ordered), clam with white wine and garlic broth, and mushroom soup. All went down well. Nice ham and sweet melon. Fresh clams. Tasty broth. Good portion size for all starters. For main, it was spinach ravioli for him, Linguine Al Granchio for me and Norcina pizza (for the kids to share). Ravioli was good to him. Half good half bad for the pizza. As for me, the linguine was a big letdown - I bit into too many (crab?) shells (should have taken a picture), soft shell crab was crappy and so salty and the lobster bisque, oh forget it!We only managed one lava cake for dessert.....just to try. It was okay. Perhaps it was a full house for New Year's Eve dinner that compromised its standard, but I'll probably try out its lunch one day when hopefully it's not that busy and noisy.
4
Cozy place, good food and excellent staff , weekends you might end up waiting for a while so book in advance if you can. I would recommend to try Bruschetta Etna, Lasagna alla Bolognese, Stinco di Agnello al Forno con Purea di Patate. And don't forget to get your beer I liked the Moretti.Cheers have a nice time
5
Etna is nice and cosy place for the family. The food is brilliant and the staff is really friendly and helpful.For starter like Bruschetta al Pomodoro with olive oil. Love the Burrata and the red cherry tomatoes that goes with it. The cheese in the Buratta is so fresh, spongy and tasty. As my wife is vegetarian they give us the Ham seperately with the Burrata.For the main course have tried the Risotta (veg version) , Diavola Pizza (Salami Pizza), Tonno Scottato (seared tuna ). Can distinctly imagine the wonderful memory and taste of these dishes long after we have been to this place. Want to go back for more.The Tiramisu desert is best way to end this wonderful dinner in Etna. Like most Italian food in Singapore Etna is expensiv
4
A small and cosy place for semi-fine dinning in the East Coast neighbourhood. The restaurant is mostly fully occupied during dinner, reservation is a must. The service is professional, attentive and food is excellent. Daily specials provide varieties for regulars. Corkage is $30, or you could have house pour for >$15++, but the volume is rather small. Meal per head is about $50. It is by far the best Italian Resturant in the East side of Singapore. Oh! You have to try their starter: Burrata cheese with tomato and salad rocket. Sopraffino
3
Heard a lot of good reviews and was quite excited. But food was quite forgettable but the boo boos not so. Service excellent otherwise. It is one of my foodie bro's go to place for italian in the neighbourhood. For the price, we really do not wish to see the boo boos they made. For that it is tough for me to return despite convenience. But given the good reviews from others, i guess they had a bad day.
4
This is a neighborhood restaurant and the feeling is so great as compared to all these supposedly fancy restaurant in town. The crew is awesome but most importantly, the food is really great and authentic. I can't wait to go there again!
4
This is not a very big place - with a few table outdoors. However, in Singapore weather, one may prefer indoors and as such reservation is recommended. They have daily Chef specialities and with some options for vegetarians like us.Good service with good food. Can be little pricey and budget for about $40-50 for a complete meal
4
I'm an eat local fan, but this was not my choice and its was a nice surprise. Good range of traditional Italian food, the service was very good indeed. It was reasonably busy on a Tuesday evening which is always a good sign. It's a relaxing dinning experience, go and try
4
I visited Etna the other day. I had been there several times before and was always impressed with the consistent quality and friendly welcome in this restaurant. I love the decor and the choice of outdoor or indoor seating.The menu has been updated, but the food is still exceptionally good. There is an exceptionally good selection of wine from which to choose from. I decided on this occasion to have a salad which was excellent, and not too heavy.A really nice neighbourhood restaurant with a warm and friendly welcome for all
5
When my granddaughter chose this restaurant for our dinner together, I was delighted to learn it was Italian! Small by American standards; reservations are a must. Seating and service were prompt and many specials were explained. We began with Burrata with prosciutto, vine grown tomatoes and arugula......delicious cheese and pairing that was a treat for mr palate. We had Margherite el Pistaccio de Bronte (ravioli. with walnuts and a white sauce - delicious) and Lasagna alla Bolognese with paper thin layers of pasta and sauce. We opted out on dessert needless to say. Upon departing the owner acknowledged my granddaughter and sent regards to the family. Nice touch and a positive experience from start to finish. I am certain we will return before heading home to the USA
5
We had a perfect meal here last night. Greeted in Italian we were quickly shown to a table despite not having a reservation. The decor is understated with clean lines and minimum fuss. The wine, we chose Italian, of course,was perfectly chilled and refreshing. A menu to cater for all tastes we chose off the specials board and were delighted with the delicious food. The waiters were quietly and efficiently attentive; they explained what each dish consisted of. The limited dessert menu provided for most tastes and the special was delightful in taste and presentation
4
Etna is a familiar and cosy dining venue that serves great authentic Italian fare. Highly recommend the Florentine steak, beautifully plated with the freshest vine tomatoes and potatoes with herbs. Another dish we always come back for is the Burrata with tomatoes. Both dishes are sharing portions. You cant go wrong with their pizzas too. A great takeaway order is just a phone call away. Anna, co owner is a wonderful host and her team, mainly from Italy makes each visit a wonderful experience.

Cozy restaurant with excellent service. We ordered mostly from the today's specials and would give the T-Bone a big thumps up (sharing for 2 pax). Food all around was above average. Linguine al Granchio however was not quite my favorite. The sauce was just not quite right. The dessert was great, lava cake and tiramisu stands out for us.The service was excellent. Staff took time to explain the specials, ensured that water was always topped up and random checking to ensure that everything was ok. Overall, a good experience and would come back agai

So I went with my adoptive local family, who were given outdoor seating though there was enough room inside, only gracing us with air-conditioning when asked! As it was a celebration, we ordered cocktails- Etna surprise or whatever etna-ish. Even a sniffer dog would not have detected the alcohol and our bearer confirmed that they do not add too much vodka! The salad and food was just about so-so. The complimentary bread basket looked dehydrated.The only interesting thing there were the lamps. Oh yes! Dessert, I must say was quite lovely.I don't see myself travelling up Mt.Etna again

We normally go to Al Forno's which is little closer to the CBD. This was our first time at Etna and we had a delightful evening. The woman who took us to our table was really enthusiastic about the food and recommended a great Italian red. They accommodated my wife's dietary needs with no fuss and did's make us feel we were being awkward. The food came - it was really good and included a beautifully grilled Italian sea bass grilled to perfection! It's a bit more upmarket than Al Forno's. I would recommend it

I have been there twice and always amazed by the quality of the food.
The Burrata with San Daniele prosciutto were really mouth watering.
Pizza and appetisers were also great.
4
The burrata was really goood along with the ham and fresh tomatoes. The service is great, they are super nice.
5
The braised pork is good. Must try. The gelati are great too! Best enjoy it with your family and friends
5
had burrata and braised pork belly for starters. burrata was so fresh and the pork belly so succulent! pasta was awesome as it was cooked to the right degree. excellent dessert! will visit again!

ETNA along Upper East Coast Road is our local Italian Restaurant. However, its the only place in Singapore that I actually enjoy eating Italian food and my whole family agrees. Service is warm and friendly and Georgia manages the restaurant calmly and efficiently. Great food, great service. Wine List needs updating a bit but minor point
4
I come to Etna quite regularly with my girlfriend when we want some good Italian food that is not in the heart of town. The atmosphere is lively with chatter from all the guests but still quiet enough to have personal conversation. The staff are prompt and friendly and the Chefs regularly comes out to talk to guests and making sure everything is ok. You have to make a reservation at least a day in advance cause it gets booked up pretty fast. What we love most about Etnas is that the food is value for money (ingredients are mainly from Italy) and it gets better with them having an accreditation from the Italian Embassy

Etna is an authentic Italian restaurant. There are two of them in Singapore. This review is about the one on Upp East Coast Road. (The other Etna is on Duxton Road.) The restaurant takes the name, appropriately, from the volcano in Sicily, Italy. The menu leans heavily on produce from that region. In true Italian style the restaurant is now billed as a ristorante, graduated from its humble beginning as a trattoria. The place has an upscale ambience of an elegant, fine eatery decorated with Italian objet d'art. The service is efficient and friendly. We, a group of six, had reservation and were seated immediately. The restaurant is crowded, and it is prudent to book early. Menu is quite elaborate, and is exclusively genuine Italian. Wine list is extensive and is quite impressive. It is available by glass or by bottle. Beer and liquor are available, but in the true Italian atmosphere they might seem out of place.Etna is a restaurant we loved and would love to go back to again

My husband and I visited this restaurant a couple weeks ago. Our meals were very good. We ordered a pizza to share as a main. The crust was thin and crisp, the toppings were generous and the cheese melted and toasted perfectly. We'll definitely return. A minor issue with our meal was dealt with quickly and professionally
1
We make a booking at 6.30pm. we are party of 3 adults and 2 kids. Our house are walking distance to the restaurant. We arrived at 6.30pm. There is nobody outside at the reception so we decide to enter the restaurant. The minute my sister step in, the chief or the captain hand signal to us with his index finger no no. Do not come in. We were stunned. We waited a few seconds to see if he would open his mouth and say something but he was just signaling his hand in a rude manner. I believe he was conducting a briefing or meeting before dinner starts. If we interrupted you, don't need to be rude. For the record he is an Italian I suppose and he would have just tell us to step outside a while we are getting ready. Atrocious ! We lost our appetite and walk away.
4
The food in general is good and tasty and prepared well .. no complaints.The service, from most male staff is poor until your arm gets tired waving for attention. However two staff are very good.Wine list is fairly goodhowever as stated before for a neighbourhood establishment the prices are rather steep
5
Ones of the more authentic Italian Restaurants in Singapore. They serve a great meal and a choice place to go with friends.
5
Excellent food. While the specials are expensive, they are definitely worth ordering. My personal favourite is the Burrata cheese salad and truffle pasta. The sommelier Georgia really knows her wine and has been spot-on in all her recommendations.
5
The quality's food is very good and the staff efficiency is impressive.when You are there seems to stay in a Small italian Village... Congratulations

visited this joint last week for first time. not a big choice of Italian food round so the choice is pretty limited. I must say that the service was good but food is average and very pricey without mentioning their wine.we were a group of 4 and spent 93$ excluding of GST and service charge per head wich is 435$ including ++ with an average bottle of win
1
Service was patronisingly polite, but main course served too late after starters, so we felt full by the time the main course actually came.Food was over-ratesd, the crab linguine was too fishy. The rocket salad had very little dressing. Ine pasta dish was like udon and sausages...Tried to order lava cake, but restaurant could not accommodate because they had no oven capacity (then why put it on the menu?).Bill took ages to arrive, had to go to counter to get it myself.Neither the food nor the service was worth the price
5
I went to Etna in Siglap with a family group, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The food and wine was delicious and the waiter extremely helpful with recommendations. I chose a lobster special for entree, and it was yummy.Recommended for fans of rustic Italian cooking, family style
5
For sure my favorite Italian Restaurant is Etnas the ambience, service and food spectacular, you don't need the menu to looking for options just let you take by Georgia for the wine and the best of the day she make with Giovani a very good team we mis Ana but Georgia take good care of the place, just ask to surprise you with an option, every dish is a experience, the quality and taste beat the price.Don't loose the opportunity to a very good culinary experience. The option any of the 3 places of SICILIA MIA GROUP.DUXTON, UPPER EAST COAST, AND THE NEW ONE IO ITALIAN OSTERIA.For me Upper East Coast

The food and service were ok, just ok. We made reservations and despite several open tables (they did have reserved signs but not occupied the entire time we were there) we were shown to a small (read very small) table wedged in-between another couple and a family of five. It was impossible to have a private conversation and awkward when food was served. The place is small and has many tables. It was not a pleasant experience and will probably not return. There are tables outside and maybe we should have asked to move. It is uncomfortable to sit so close to complete strangers at this kind of restaurant. Menu choices were a tad limited, specials looked good but were pricey. Wine choices lacked. I may have enjoyed the food a tad bit more if I was not wedged in a very small space while trying to eat
4
Great lobster pasta and excellent wine and a great place for Italian. As for the atmosphere, felt that the tables were all cramped together as they are probably trying to maximize the space they have! Could be better spaced out and the lighting could be dimmer.A little pricey but would definitely go back for a special occasion

Let's be fair: the food was pretty decent (pasta and pork cheek were good, lasagna was ok, pizza wasn't anything to rave about), and the person topping up the drinks was attentive enough. The maÃ®tre d was polite and warm.But everything about the experience started to go downhill when we asked to order our food. As we went round the table ordering our starters and mains, the female waitress interrupted us and said it would be good if we could list all our starters before moving on to mains, otherwise it was not going to be possible for her to take down everything person by person. And she delivered this rather curtly.When the pizza came, our friend had the sharpest of eyes to spot a hair sticking out from the centre of the dish. We promptly called the waiter, who apologised and went to make a new one. But there was no separate attempt at an apology or way of making it up later on. We weren't expecting a free meal, of course, but at least have the decency to come over and apologise for the mistake instead of hoping it will blow over.When we were done with our meal, one of the waiters asked if we wanted any desserts. We said no, and asked if there was any credit card discount, to which the waiter said no. But when the bill came, another waiter said there was a DBS card discount. All rather confusing, but never mind, let's pay the bill.When the bill returned for the signature, they passed it to the wrong person to sign. Then soon after that was settled, one of the waiters told us - mind you, it wasn't a request - that he really needed the table. Meaning that we had to scoot even though Etna never told us at the time of reservation or at the meal that we had a limited time to dine there. The waiter wasn't even apologetic about telling us to go. My first time here, and probably my last. We're paying $45 per pax and the least we could expect is some friendliness and courtesy. That's not asking for too much, and there are plenty of places where you can get that at lower prices. What a shame

The only reason to be here was to taste the rich and creamy fresh burrata, served with parma ham! Pizzas are about the least expensive items on the menu.
2
They blame the pizza receipe is special but it's all wrong (I'm from Italy). Everything else has very high quality but the prices can be outrageous.
3
Had a Pizza , Ravioli and a pasta in pesto sauce (All Vegetarian), the bill came to SGD 95!One Staff member was good and friendly but 2 of them had an attitude and found them to be bit arrogant . No doubt the food is good but really not worth the price !!No doubt the table layout and presentation etc is very nice.
5
My friend and I didn't expect much from Etna before our meal because good Italian is kinda hard to find in Singapore. We were totally wrong! Everything was great, they had vegetarian options, gluten free options, freshly made pasta, and great wine options. Most of all, staff was knowledgeable with both food and wine and was also very friendly. It is a place to go for a nice dinner. Not a cheap meal but worth every penny because of the quality
5
5 of us had dinner here and from start to finish we had a sensational experience. When we walked into the restaurant it was completely full - not a spare seat to be had! But despite being hugely busy, the staff were superb - front of house were almost all Italians and really knew their trade. Giovanni was particularly helpful in guiding us with our wine selection. Anna, the executive Chef was as lovely as ever, keeping a finger on the pulse at all times and very much in the foreground!The food was exquisite; between us we had the burrata (a huge serve so do share!) special (sea bream), pork escalopes, tuna and the Mediterranean salad. We can highly recommend the affogato and the pannacotta for dessert. The serves were generous as were the salads and veggies. We shall definitely be going back. Many thanks Etna! Please keep up the good work

This is my favourite Italian in town. High quality Italian cooking very well executed. Great pastas especially the porcini and sausage one and spinach and ricotta ravioli also very good pizza and they will event cook a Hawaian. Reasonably priced for Singapore and you can BYO wine and pay modest corkage. My wife and I live in the area but didn't visit for the first three years thinking it wouldn't be good. Well we were very, very wrong. We know go most weeks.It reminds of a good family restaurant in Italy with a lot of great food and smiling faces. The staff are fantastic. I am very confident about taking my Italian friends there when they next visit.And did I mention the Tiramisu...........don't save yourself for Udders Ice Cream across the road just loosen your belt a notch.
5
This rates as an extremely good neighbourhood Italian restaurant, in my humble opinion at least. I suppose the owners could be Sicilian given the name "Etna" ; they were certainly very hospitable and efficient. What did we eat ? Risotto, lamb, truffle pasta and .... I have forgotten the rest, but everything was superb. All washed down with an Aussie Shiraz which was OK.Good atmosphere - diners included Indians to our right, Russians behind us, various Europeans at other tables and quite a few Chinese. Deo volente, we will be back one day

If you want to go to a small Italian home style restaurant, go to Etna. Owned by an Italian expat who brought his recipes with him, Etna is just a good place for an Italian meal. Pizzas, pastas, fish dishes, salads...all were very, very good. Try the sea bass if it is available. Don't forget the homemade tiramisu for dessert. Great wine list as well...not as extravagant as Garibaldi's but more than adequat

Midweek dinner. On arrival, greeted with warmth and shown to table. Relatively small premises but outdoor seating also available; decor was simple but pleasant. Menu offered selection of antipasta, pasta, mains, and also blackboard specials of the day. Wine selection extensive, and MaÃ®tre d was knowledgeable and un-condescending with her advice. We had: bruschetta selection, lamb, lasagna, pizza with 4 cheeses, ravioli. Brushetta was well-presented and tasty. Lasagna was very rich and creamy - a little different to what I am accustomed to, but nonetheless, nice. Pizza was medium-crust, and rich and creamy. Overall, good standards for food. Service was efficient and friendly, and kudos for serving cold water from the tap (so much more environmentally friendly). Prices were a little on the high side, with mains ranging from $24-$60. Overall, a pleasant experience in the East

Food: delicious and authentic Presentation of food: fantasticStaff knowledge of Italian food: excellentService: top class Wine: pretty exhaustive Italian wine collection Price: mid to high end. With one drink and 2 pax, you can expect to spend about 150 sgdFavorites: we are still exploring! That said, the lasagna bolognese and linguine al granchio are must tries
5
This was just one of those hectic weeks when you feel like treating yourself with some real good bread, cheese wine and risotto awesome place we relished the food and very helpful staff .
5
Etna has become one of our favourite Italian restaurants. There are some delicious vegetarian options on the menu, and we particularly enjoy the mushroom ravioli with pistachio sauce as well as the wood fired pizzas. Yummy deserts too!
4
It's not that expensive restaurant and I quite like the grilled squid( not fried calamari) and baked egg plant and tomato. Friendly staffs and good quality of food. Pizza is good too. Reservation is required on sat night.
4
Me and my girl stopped for a drink and some prosciutto on melon.Very pleasant place with very friendly staff.Excellent on site made bread and grissini, melon and prosciutto of good quality and very quick service.We sat outside, but the inside is very well done and decorated, I am sure it makes for a pleasant dinner !Will definitely return for a proper full meal one of these days

Been meaning to try this place for a while and since both good pal and I are on leave, we went down to satisfy our Italian cravings. We ordered: 1) Clams in wine broth - we were greedy and hungry (often a deadly combi) and since the waiter highly recommended this starter, we happily took it. And it was a great recommendation! The clams were fresh and the broth was just off the charts!! 2) Carbonara - it's lovely in terms of flavour and it's cream is not runny at all. Love it! Thank goodness we were sharing this as we always feel too ger-lat to finish one whole plate by ourselves. 3) Seafood Marinara - I always judge this dish by how flavourful the tomato base sauce is. And this sauce passes with flying colours!! It's not tangy but full of Yumz! Perfect compliment with our Carbonara main 4) Molten Lava Cake - supposedly their must-order dessert and they bake it fresh upon ordering. Didn't disappoint. :) 5) Pistachio Tiramisu - another of their must-order dessert. Nice Tiramisu with a hint of pistachio. Wonderful! Service staff is commendable as they are knowledgable and sincere. Pity it's not at a place with good parking, but it'll remain one of my fav Italian go-to place. :
5
We go here almost once a week and have never been disappointed. Service is warm yet efficient, atmosphere is authentic and relaxed, food and wine is exceptional. We ordered the burrata a few times which is fresh and yummy. However it is a bit much for two, so ordered the burrata pizza tonight which was excellent. Salads are fresh and interesting and pastas that we have tried have never disappointed. My favorite restaurant in Singapore

Finally made it to Etna for a proper Italian meal that is a little more traditional, home style - not the fine dining, over priced version all too common these days. We had high expectations after lots of recommendations and Italian being a favourite cuisine for all of us we can be a bit of a tough audience - there was no disappointment here.Our starter was the highly recommended Buffalo Mozzarella, easily large enough to feed 4 of us and came with large vines grown cherry tomatoes, rocket and finely sliced prosciutto, a perfect starter. For mains we ordered lamb shanks, ox-tail fettuccine, ricotta ravioli and sea bass on pasta. Every dish was perfectly presented & cooked and tasted fantastic. We finished off with deserts of pannacotta, affagato and a personal favourite, real ricotta cannoli.Our hosts, although busy, were very attentive and helped us select our meals a great red wine from a worthy list to accompany the meal, also enjoying a great Limoncello with desert.The restaurant has a very nice feel to it, decked out in country Italian decor.A great evening with good food and wine - a perfect Italian meal enjoyed the way it should be. Definitely going back and highly recommended

Previously I gave this a 5 star review. Friday night ordered the calamari. Now when you order calamari your expectations default to a golden, crispy, simple but delicious starter. Not six damp warmish rubbery rings in a drizzle of tasteless aioli. Mains weren't up to scratch either. Front of house is great, kitchen not so much... maybe previously we were lucky. No idea. Try Bruno's 20 mins walk away
5
I've lived nearby for a year and never got round to checking Etna out. We finally did on Friday... managed to get a table as a walk-in at around 8pm but it was essentially full (as it often appears to be). Warmly welcomed and directed to the burrata starter special. It was very good, as were the two pasta entrees we ordered. Will definitely go here more often

Impressed with the service, staff was attentive, warm and friendly. Plus the chef came out to ask us how our meal was, liked the personalized service.The restaurant had a very homely atmosphere. Nice and pleasant surroundings.Enjoyed our appetizers of Carne cruda al coltello (although we couldn't really taste the anchovies sauce) and Schiacciata: Rosmarino/Aglio/Peperoncino.(the chillis were a nice hit).Had the scallop/prawn pasta with white wine sauce, (one of the specials of the day) which was nice although a little too much olive oil for my liking, my partner had the squid ink pasta with seafood, which was tasty, but also a little too much olive oil for his liking. The seafood in both dishes were cooked to perfectly. Loved the scallops!Desserts and the Limoncello was a nice way to end a lovely evening.Would go back again and recommend others to go as well...
