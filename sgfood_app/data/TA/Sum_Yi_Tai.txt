My wife and i had dinner there, and the sweet and sour pork is really nice! but the important thing is to ensure that you are sitting at the roof!
4
The beef horfun is full of wok hei and full of beef, dim sum selection is very limited for lunch, offering the usual suspects.
3
For new experience, food average if you looking for very good food dinning. The coffee is expensive at 6 buck, not worth. Very normal cup coffee. Only good for drinking with friends, some finger food.
4
Ordered roasted meat and duck for lunch. Meats are tender and juicy. Restaurant is cozy and comfortable.
1
I was surprised with the small portion of roasted meat at $12. It was cold and had to add noodles to eat the roasted meat. The roasted duck was tough and had lots of bones while the BBQ pork was cold and dry.
4
love the vibes of the place, feels like hong kong with grasshopper song playing in the background. I find the food is alright only
4
Really interesting multi storey bar, restaurant. Food snacks are interesting and good, beer selections limited but enough and excellent quality., Service good and great atmosphere, however if it rains, then better head somewhere else as the place is usually booked solid so nowhere to go!

Went there for a pre-dinner drink and was lucky to get in without a reservation (strongly recommended). The roof top bar isn't that big but love the setting of being surrounded by high rise office building and yet have that cosy setting of a private bar. The cocktails were themed along the 1970's HK gangster movies. We tried the chilli fried whitebaits - loved it. Would love to come back again to sample more

Visited during lunchtime and did not order drinks, so can only comment on the lunch menu. Generally thought the prices were kinda steep (total bill came to about $40+ for 2 pax and we only got 3 dishes). Thought the Signature XO Carrot Cake was the highlight of the meal, but everything else was just okay. The roast meat platters (we ordered char siew and roast pork) had tiny portion sizes. I think "double" just means you can choose two kinds of meat and not how many people the dish can be shared by; it was barely enough for one person, let alone two. On the upside, we served complimentary soup and the interior decor was pretty cool
5
Super glad to have chanced upon Sum Yi Tai on Chope's listing. Loved the idea of Chinese food served in small plates. The roast pork belly and char siew are not to be missed! XO Carrot Cake is also not to be missed! We arrived 10mins before our reservation at 8pm and it was a perfect timing as Happy Hour ends at 8pm. We asked staff if they could move us to a bigger table at the rooftop bar, they were accommodating and moved us to the rattan seats. It was a splendid birthday eve thanks to the good folks and food at Sum Yi Tai
4
Great place for a meal or drinks! Service was efficient and our food came out quickly! A crowded restaurant made up a buzzy atmosphere!
4
Tapas style Chinese dish. A little pricy but overall taste was good. Nice place to hang out after work.
4
Great ambience that serve up Cantonese tapas dishes. Their happy hour runs from 7-9pm, the must try is the claypot rice and he meat platter.
5
hands down one of my fav restos in singapore. everything from the decor and presentation of food is lovely. seems like lunch time is especially popular now due to the affordable lunch deals. I still love my salted egg squid and fish skin tho!
4
An interesting bar that offers delicious hawker dishes. Very friendly happy hour drink price. A popular bar and was always packed on my last 3 visits on a week day. Service was always friendly and prompt.
5
we had the set lunch and shared a side dish. the food was awesome and the service was prompt and fast (:
5
I love the pork Patty rice... So tender and consistent in taste. Reasonably priced for lunch and loved the free flow double-boiled soup of the day.
5
This place provides good Value, tasty food, amazing service and food quality is great using fresh produce.
4
Nice oriental restaurant serving Chinese tapas for dinner. My favorite dish would be their triple platter - the roast meat was awesome and being a carnivore cum pork lover, I wished the serving was bigger. Nice chill-out place but felt the music was a little loud. Had to put our ears together as we talk. Price is slightly on the high side but all the dishes were good, no disappointment.Reservations encouraged as itâ€™s popular and crowded
3
I hope the chairs upstairs are better, I made a reservation and was stuck on a terrible table near the lift. Lucky others came and rode the lift as my posterior went numb. The chairs are metal unpadded narrow and too tallThe food was good but its really uncomfortable sitting there.The salted egg fish skins were good, the steamed tofu parcels good. The Gong Bao mushrooms were more than a little too spicy. The Mui Choy Pork Belly Clay Pot with Lotus Buns was very nice as was theWhite Bait, Szechuan Style with Peppercorn.Nice place but for gods sake do something about the seatin
3
Food was ok. The XO carrot cake was so so but then the shrimp paste chicken was really gd. Other than that the ambience Is good.
5
Good food, lunch service is efficient, reasonable and delectable. The bar is well stocked and the service is impeccable. I highly recommend this place.
5
The only downside will be the price of the food. Apart from that, the flavors were really good! Lastly, the service was great.
4
Friendly service though they will be a bit slow due to the crowd. Express lunch set is quite value worth. Food is a little salty
5
Bar setting which will be good to host overseas friends. Celebrated birthday there with free Chinese buns.
4
Went here for a bite to eat and to sample the whiskeys on a Wednesday evening. The place was bustling even during midweek with a large group on the ground floor. We were interested in the Chinese tapas so chose to remain on the ground floor but sit out front on the path. Being out of sight didn't effect the service - staff were on hand whenever we needed to place an order. We enjoyed the spot outside, watching the passing people and traffic and enjoying some lovely food. We had the Gong Bao chicken, Fried Golden Mushrooms, Garlic Kai Lan and the King Prawn Wanton in Chilli. We sampled some Habiki Harmony whiskey and washed it all down with some Asahi. We thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The food was full of flavour and plenty of spice. The chicken, in particular, was lovely, plenty of heat and the flesh succulent and flavourful. The service was excellent even though they were very busy. You probably need to book, as it seems it gets pretty busy, and it may be noisy, but that is all part of Sum Yi Tai's vibrancy and part of life in Singapore's Chinatown. At S$136 for a couple, we though it excellent value. Recommended

From the semblance, this little space looks like one of those western bars that fill up the street every evening. Once you step in, you'll have trouble to decide a theme you want your evening to be. Housed in 3 storeys each offering a different facade, from the rooftop to the intimate lounge, we picked the latter. I wasn't expecting a wok fire culinary to live in such a fancy joint but what turned out on our dining plate knocked me to retest my sobriety. You find a long list of oriental favorites including beef hor fun, brisket with buns and the unbelievable fried carrot cake that took my breath away. Totally unexpected! Following a sumptuous dinner you won't need to move your butt to enjoy the rest of the evening in soothing vibes and the company hippie crowd. Ambience at the lounge was just right... service was impeccable

Sum Yi Tai is located in one of those 4-storey conservation building along Boon Tat Street. Was there on a weekday last week. It was spread over 1st & 2nd and the rooftop. 3rd storey is for staff only. The lifts to every floor can only be activated by staff with pass card! The ambiance indoors was cool and dark with Hong Kong gambling dens of the 60s theme. The rooftop bar was great with a view of the city and its surroundings. Remember to call and reserve rooftop seating because its by reservation only! We managed to get seating at the rattan sofas but had to vacate by a certain time as there was a reservation.The food there was traditional Chinese/Asian and really (and surprisingly for a drinking place) very good. Good variety of drinks and Happy Hour prices were very competitive. Overall a must try if looking for a nice place to unwind after a long day and have some drinks with delicious food in the CBD area
5
Had the chinese mojito which was quite delicious! The Dai lo was however too strong of a kick to us. Each of their dragon cocktails are presented in a unique, cute way. However, the best part is the rooftop bar; great ambiance though not much view, not too crowded/noisy at weekend night. Great place to chill out overall
4
Came here for Happy Hour. Prices are decent during this period. Was seated at the roof top- not that there was much view but definitely more space and air than indoors. Tried the cocktails - "Morning After" was a tad dilute; "Chinese Mojito" had an interesting twist of Chrysanthemum, kind of lovely. "Date a Gangster" was ordinary whereas "Dai Lou" was woohoo, a lot of kick! Wait staff, Vert, was really friendly and candid. Will definitely return
5
Good value, i enjoy eating here. the food is reasonable price and the soup is very tasty!! like out of this world
5
We had a table on the rooftop and were originally just going for drinks. We ordered a few of the Chinese tapas and were really impressed - the beef cubes, garlic potatoes and dumplings were especially nice.
4
Good beer happy hour and service ok. We sat at bar so perhaps better service for us than other groups outside. $10 pints for happy hour. nice room, artwork, seats and atmosphere. A nice place for friends or a date even.
5
Unique decor, amazing food and staff. The manager is a friendly chap that ensures that his customers are comfortable.
4
Ambient was good, food was great. But more rooms for improvement for your Claypot rice. Overpriced for the way it was prepared and cooked.
5
Sum yi tai served really good food and it was the ambience was great! Enjoyed my visit and will definitely visit back again.
5
1 of my favourite lunch places, excellent service and their lunch express is at GREAT value with free flow soup. I have very fond memories of this bar/restaurant because the first time I was there I met a someone a while back...still brings back good memories and if you love reminiscing the good old days u will love the 90s cantopop songs they play there
4
Once you stepped in the bar you would think that the place sells chicken/duck rice. Food was delicious but a tad pricey. I would recommend the beef cubes, fried horfun and salmon skin. They are must try! If you would like to reminisce the 90s feel with past heavenly kings like Leslie cheng, Aaron Kwok, this is the best place to be
2
Just make sure you tell them u need a table for adults. Booked for a table of 6 and was given 2 small tables outside with bar stools and was told it can fit 6 adults which obviously can't. Waitress and manager kept insisting it was possible which we asked them to show us. And if it starts to rain outside, get ready to get wet. Poor experience, bad service.
5
Went to Sum Yi Tai for a colleague's birthday lunch. Lunch menu was very affordable and value for money. Portion size was just right and the food was done well. I had the honey glazed char siew rice and my colleagues had the Kurobuta pork belly. All done well, and not to mention the free refill of boiled Cantonese style soup! Such a hearty meal.
2
Ordered their fried rice, roast pork and kailan, very average and nowhere near din tai fung's for a much higher price
5
Good lunch sets, had the bean noodle. authentic and tasty. the chilli is really spicy but its nice! will return
3
Good ambience! The honey charsiew and the Beancurd skin rolls tasted so good!! :) service can be further improved as one of them was quite rude to us when we asked if there was a smoking area
3
kitschy and fun but food is so so at best. the claypot rice is disappointing. expected better. but overall okay place
4
My usual hangout for lunches with friends. Love their XO carrot cake and their awesome soup. Nice place to catch up with friends
5
Excellent food! Great value for money and fantastic service! Staff are hospitable and we get free flow soup. Their sharing platters and ala carte are decent portions sure to serve the hungry lunch crowd!
4
Food was nice and ambience was cozy. Price and service can be improved. Overall a good experience and will come back again next time
5
Stumbled upon Sum Yi Tai while looking for lunch today... had a good vibe about it, so I looked no further and stepped right in.2 of us ordered the steamed meat patty and minced pork noodle (zha jiang mian) to share - the latter was non-conventional as it was seasoned with hot chilli oil instead of the usual black bean sauce; while meat patty was well seasoned, tender and non-fatty, it's easily 1 of the best I have eaten! As we wait for food to be prepared, we were served boiled soups which was so rich in flavour...this is such a bonus!Price-wise - they have lunch menu, hence each main is about $8 (excludes service charge, GST). Service staff were polite and rather prompt. And, they do lunch delivery as well.True to my instinct, it was really a good find for quick and simple lunch... just what you need in CBD area

We came to Sum Yi Tai for my husband’s birthday, as we had walked pasted this place a few times and thought it looked nice. We also had an “Entertainer voucher” which gave us 1for1 on tapas and 1for 1 on drinks. We had booked and in the comments I mentioned that we are coming for my husband’s birthday, but the table they had for us was not a nice one inside with cool atmosphere but a table outside on the street. What’s the point of booking if you don’t get a nice table and just get a table that walk in customer would get? Also it was not that busy at the time. They ended up moving us 3 times… and we eventually got seated at a table at the roof to bar which was nice. As soon as we were seated I mentioned we have the Entertainer App, which they seemed annoyed about it and the service got worse. When using vouchers I always make a point to tell them upfront so I can know what section of the menu I can use it for, I have never had such horrible service. As Sum Yi Tai had vouchers for food and drinks I assumed we could use one voucher for food and one voucher for drinks (as this is the cases at all other places we had been). However they were quite rude about this and told us only one several times, even though I only asked once. Why advertise yourself with entertainer of you are only going to be rude to the people who use them? The cocktails were watery and not very nice, some of the food was good but other was not. Although the selection of food we seen on other tables looked quite nice. The atmosphere is very lovely – but that is about the only positive I have for this place. We will not be coming back.
5
Love the double boiled soup that comes w every meal!! ITS SOOO GOOD! Excellent service staff too, even gave us advice on how to maximise our experience there - ie. which items are the popular ones and which tables to choose if we have a choice. My third time here and I love it!
5
The rooftop bar has great view of the downtown skyscrapers. Rather cozy layout, serviced by attentive staff. Happy hour prices are very decent.
3
Came here for dinner on a busy Friday night. The place was packed and it wasn't easy to find seats. We missed happy hour so drink prices weren't that cheap. Food was ok but nothing to rave about. Surprised this place is so popular.
5
Reasonable food at great price. the soup is tasty and has this wonderful creamy taste. the lunch seats are good value!
2
Nothing special. Food was just so so. Not value for money. Will not recommend friends. Service and staff not very friendly.
5
The food is nice, and the soup is tasty. The soup is free flow refill! Its a good ambiance. Good to have a beer as well on the side. Most items less than $10. Very cheap and good food in a heritage district of singapore
4
We had a project party here. Good mocktails. The food was unexpectedly good. Gong Bo chicken, chilli garlic fries and chicken wings were great. The barramundi fish also was quite an interesting and unique dish. Overall good experience. The lift was out of order so we had to take the stairs.
5
It was my second time at the restaurant and I have yet another great experience. The food was good and priced reasonably. It was a pity we didnt make it up to the rooftop bar which provides a good view as it was raining. Will be back agai
3
I had $10 sake here during happy hour on my birthday night. I was here at quite an early time in the evening so the place was not crowded or bustling with energy in the slightest. I like the interior of the place with it's 1980's-themed Hong Kong design, especially the outer facade of the bar with it's neon-light sign and minimalist decoration. Unfortunately I didn't try any special cocktails or drinks, but overall, my experience here was very average. The rooftop is quite nice but nothing mind-blowing. Quite an ordinary place, if you ask me
4
Sum Yi Tai is located in a shophouse along Boon Tat Street, in the hip Telok Ayer area. Given its price point and location, it's obviously catering to the neighbouring Raffles Place crowd of moneyed yuppies and expatriates. The bar-restaurant occupies 3 floors: a rooftop bar (nice but not much of a view, given it's only 3 storeys high), a bar on the second floor (Big Trouble in Little China/ Hong Kong Karaoke/ Geylang Nightclub inspired decor) and a bar/restaurant on the ground floor (Canto/Hong Kong theme). The food is typical Cantonese (think sweet sour pork, char siew and fried rice), served "tapas style" (translation: small). To be fair, the quality is actually not too bad but a tad expensive for the servings. The drinks on the other hand were exhorbitant (we passed). Go for the experience, but be prepared to leave value at the door
2
came for drinks after work last friday. it was rather full, but we got a seat at the counter. maybe they were short staffed because it took forever long for the server to get our order. we ordered 2 glasses of wine. when it arrived, one of them had a piece of cork in it. we were surprised that the bartender or whoever poured the wine did not notice it. trying to get the staff's attention even though we were right infront of them was challenging. anyhow, we got the glass of wine exchanged. overall, i do not think much of this, not likely to return. decor is too cheesy for my taste
5
Great place for a drink or two in the heart of Singapore... Fancy Cocktail list and the two i tried were spot on...
Great Customer Service and a place i will go back to.
4
The place is filled with retro decor which brings you back to the 80s, drown with Cantonese oldies to accompany you along the night while you enjoy your night out with your friends.
4
The rooftop bar has a great skyline view during the evening.The Chinese tapas are great especially the cha siew and the salted egg sauce.Great place for gathering during happy H as the happy h deals are great.Level 1 has a cool Chinese interior design too
5
The refreshing soup servings were amazing. Good ambience and great team of service staff! Will definitely be back again
4
They offer Happy hour housepour drinks till 8pm. I didn't go to the other floors, only stayed at the first but I understand they hv a roof top bar.
4
The ambience of the restaurant is nice and cosy. The decoration is also quite unique with a retro Chinese style. The servers were also quite attentive. They will refill your wine or tea often. Although the food is on the pricey side, the taste is really good. We had the sweet and sour pork, salted egg yolk tentacles, father in law's fried egg and claypot rice. All tasted very good. I will want to go back soon!
5
Talk about expectations having been exceeded ! Had dinner at ' Sum Yi Tai Dining Club ' last night , and it was a lovely experience . Arrived & was promptly seated , with the aroma of Chinese waxed meat ( liver sausage ) being steamed wafting around . Creative menu offerings , with numerous traditional classics as well as a few innovative surprises . Best of all , we dined to the strains of Cantonese music - where else can one find this in Singapore these days - greats such as Leslie Cheung & Anita Mui , and contemporary ones like Eason Chan . And the decor was lovely . Very retro Chinese feel without being kitschy . Love it , shall be back often 
3
I had the express lunch choosing the char siew rice. The char Siew was excellent but the vegetable should have been cut shorter. No metal spoon or fork was provided. The soup was re-fillable which was a pleasant surprise but gravy on the char siew was miserably little. Sitting on the ground floor near the lift was uncomfortably warm. Prices were reasonable
3
There is a cool bar on the ground floor, and on the 4th floor rooftop. We came for a private event which started with drinks on the 4th floor rooftop followed by a dinner in the 2nd floor private room. Food was quite good and the venue is looking nice (chinese decor). Service could be improved (no welcome at the hostess counter, aircondition poor on 2nd floor, slow service). Hope it improves by the time you go..
4
Great service from the time we were greeted to seated. For more formal dining request for upper floor. If casual and express dining, sit on high stool bar chairs on ground level. In the evening they open up rooftop for drinks and happy hour. Love their Angus beef hor fun, tender beef and very tasty noodles. I like claypot beancurd with vermicelli. Fried salmon skin is addictive. I like the overall decor and ambience. Will definitely recommend to try
3
We had a table at the ground floor and sampled their express lunch. If you want something more substantial or with more variety, you need to go to their 2nd floor dining room.
4
Great embience, prompt service, delicious tapas and interesting cocktail. Price was a tad expensive.
3
The foods are serve quite slow. We have 3 of us and the food came at 10 mins different each. The luncheon meat noodles are not fantastic but thier soup and salmon skins with salted egg is very nice.
3
Food is okay. Nothing special. Limited space at roof top bar. Nice to chill out. Will visit again to tey out other food and the rooftop chill out.
3
Rather pricey menu. Chinese tapas and drinks don't really pair well. Happy hour bar prices were not attractive.
5
Wandered in for an early-ish dinner w my Mom, prob not their regular clientele but we loved the food! It is a bit pricey, but the food was served fast, albeit we were 1/2 dining parities and the quality was good. The gailan was my favorite followed by the clay pot with chicken and Chinese mushrooms and their 'carrot cake' which is actually stir-fry turnip cake. The roast pork w salty egg dip was very yummy as well. My mom thought the name of the restaurant was very funny.
4
Tucked a little out of the way in the CBD on the increasingly popular bar strip on Boon Tat Street, this place has engaged somewhat more with the locals than the expat community, but is no less engaging for that.Spread over 3 floors with a regularly busy bar/diner on the ground floor, restaurant on the 2nd, and a rooftop bar on the 3rd, the interior has an air of originality and sophistication that's worth a visit alone.Just as engaging is the rooftop bar, with commercial towers all around, stretching some 40 floors above, this is accessible via a lift which requires a keycard held by the staff to activate, so be careful on a busy night that you have a reservation, as it's not a free for all. The bar snack menu serves traditional local dishes straight from the kitchen, and I can recommend the roast pork, carrot cake, and glutenous rice, although it's a shame the only tofu, like the majority of the menu, is fried
4
Went to Sum Yi Tai for our annual CNY dinner with another couple. After having drinks here a few months back at the rooftop bar, wanted to try the food. Ambiance is cool, and a nice change from stuffy Chinese restaurants across the island. Experience started off a good note when the co-founder/CEO was quick to respond to my e-mail requesting a change to the CNY menu. He was really flexible and the dish we chose (lamb short ribs) was excellent. Overall the meal was really nice, with some dishes standing out more than others (the ribs, the crab soup, in particular). I would say one feedback point would be that the service was a bit random. Everyone was really friendly, but at times more attentive than other times. Maybe after a bit more training/time at restaurant, service will become more consistent. The CEO seems to understand good service, so if he focuses on translating that to staff, i see positive things in the future of Sum Yi Tai. A good spot in the CBD -- would def consider returning
4
Was visiting the other izakaya at the other end but it was closed early. So we walked down the street and found this restaurant with a fun name. We just wanted a drink and they told us they have a rooftop bar. It is very cozy and they played cantonese songs which happens to be my era!Their cocktails are also nice but the selection is not wide
4
went there for new year eve and there was a special whereby the drinks got cheaper and cheaper through the night. that made drinks really worth it.Food was good but not value for money. The whitebait had more chillis than fish. disappointing. I would recommend the char siew and carrot cake. service was good. friendly staff. interesting concept with old Chinese music.
5
Good place for drinks. Nice nibbles. Near the office. Not too loud. The roof top is the place to be if the weather is good.
4
Very unique decor and retro chic ambience. Nice and interesting menu. But the table host is not so friendly and helpful..
3
The traditional Chinese interior made the place quirky. Service during lunch is very slow only 1 server cum waiter cum order person. Choice of dishes is quite limited and I wouldn't return as the taste has nothing to wow about. Perhaps a Kopitiam is better.
5
i was looking for a place to chill off the night with my partner and chance upon this beautiful place
4
The price is reasonable and food is quite good. We love the quiet atmosphere. A place Good for chillax.
3
Unexciting food, lacklustre service. Given it's current location, you are better off at any of the dozen or more better dining options nearby.
3
Had dinner with colleagues recently at this restaurant. Friends mentioned that it is quite new and the food is Chinese fusion. Quite easy to find the place but parking will be a challenge at Boon Tat street. The restaurant is located on the second level of a shop house unit and accessible by lift (or stairs).We tried the following items: deep fried fish skin, deep fried squid tentacle, steam fish with chilli paste, steam melon stuffed with minced pork, sunny side egg ("hor-pau dan" in Cantonese) with one large oyster on top, ku-low pork with lychees, beef cubes in pepper, long beans with minced meat and spicy bean paste, fried prawns with pomelo, fried rice and yee fu noodles. The list sounds like food from zi char - perhaps like imagining eating modern and fusion Cantonese dishes at a Hong Kong Street fish head hotpot outlet.Service was just passable as the staff were not experienced enough. But no complains. Overall, interesting presentation and naming of some common Chinese/Cantonese home or comfort dishes. High end zi char..
2
If you're considering dinner at Sum Yi Tai - triple check your booking and come with a LOT of patience. Despite having booked a table at the restaurant, we arrived to find that the entire restaurant was full with a private function. We were offered the restaurant menu at the tapas bar - and proceeded to wait 25 minutes for a round of drinks, told we had to wait even longer while they replaced the keg on their draft beer, a third of our dishes never arrived at the table - and it took a further 20 minutes to get a bottle of wine on the table - 10 minutes of which it sat on the bar. Staff were disengaged with a stunned slack-jawed look of "I don't care". When we finally got the manager to see us - he argued over a discount that was any more than the 'service charge' already added to the bill. Very poor experience. Even by Singapore's very low standards of service without a smile, this is poor. The food that did arrive was good - but we left hungry and $300 lighter
4
As soon as you enter the place you really feel like you are entering a secret place. The tapas bar at the ground floor looks like any other Chinese bar, but once you take the elevator to the restaurant it's like being taken to a Shanghai twenty years from now.The atmosphere is intimate, service absolutely impeccable.We were 4 and ordered 6 different dishes and every single one was really tasty and worth the try.We then had a drink on the roof top which was a nice way to carry on the chats with friends once the restaurant closed,but Singapore has for sure much better roof top bars.Would definitively recommend
2
We waited for 15 mins before the staff came over to take our orders. It was early, not busy but the staff were huddled in a corner chatting and engaged in their mobiles.Food was passable but marred by the fact my carrot cake and fried squid are both heavily seasoned with MSG. Its a nasty taste in the mouth and with the trending to more natural ways of seasoning and flavours we felt let down by both the food, more so by the service
