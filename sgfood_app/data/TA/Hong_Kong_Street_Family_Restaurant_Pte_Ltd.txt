Love their fish soup! Generous portion of fresh fish slices, leafy greens and flavourful broth. For $6. Probably the best fish soup around Novena MRT.

Awesome taste. Absolutely visit this Restaurant when visiting Singapore.
The Barley taste Great. The staff are nice but they are work so fast and the all fluent in Chinese, not too fluent in English.

Family type eating outlet.
Pretty extensive menu for local home cooked style.
Personal favorites are the "Kway teow@ with fish slices, & "sambal" fish head. If you don't prefer fish head, can opt for fish slices instead.
Suggest reservations on weekends.

Went to the Hong Kong Street Restaurant for a family dinner. Though i made a reservation for 7.30pm, we weren't seated till 7.50pm cuz the place was just so packed. Thankfully we could place our order whilst waiting - which then resulted in some time saving. Although the service standards are lacking,the food is very delicious and wholesome. Some signature items worth ordering include the san lor hor fun, oat prawns, prawn paste chicken

When a local restaurant is always packed with families of all ages, it signifies that the food is good and reasonably priced. Very local styled food that suits the taste buds of young and old alike. Their fish noodle soup with xo is delicious. All their Ala carte dishes are all very nice. Crowded daily during dinner times with queues waiting for taxes to be emptied

The hustle and bustle of service makes the outlet a quick turnover restaurant. Before you can finish your meal, new patrons would hoover around and stalk your table - initially waiting for you to leave but, invariably, irritating the heck out of your group that you vacate the table anyway.If this is your scene, the overall dining experience and atmposhere will garner your approval.all the same.That said, a sit-down meal in airconditioned excitement is quite a lark. The crowded feel is, at best, fleeting. At worst, it is distracting rather than annoying. The packed dining space is what good food sprouts.A definite favourite is their white noodle soup with chunks of fried fish, Garnished with chye sim greens, young ginger slices hugging the bottom of the milky soup, Marvellous.We had this plus another version that is without the noodle.With the noodle order, we gulp the soup down to a level barely covering the relatively untuched noode - this way, we were able to yet free topping up of the soup! Yeah,We also had Cereal Prawns, Sweet 'n Sour Pork, Prawn Paste Chicken, Tofu Hotplate and rice.The dishes were all good except the Cereal Prawn, which is crunchy but otherwise lacking in taste. Overall - a good meal

This restaurant is full most of the time. Reservation is highly recommended.This place is famous for their Thick Sliced Fish Beehoon. Almost every table will order this. Milk is normally added and if you prefer without milk you will have to tell them first. Another favorite dish is the prawn paste chicken wing. It is a little oily but tasted really good. Beats KFC anytime. The home made tofu is another great dish. The tofu is soft and smooth. You can skip the sambal sweet potato leaves as it is not that great. The fried rice with salted fish is fragrant and not too salty.On the whole this is a great place to bring the family for a reasonable mid range restaurant. Definite worth a few more visits

When we have a craving for Assam fish head, this is the place we go. The Thompson Road outlet is often full with limited parking in the basement car park. Also tried the prawn paste chicken and hot plate tofu. Where locals eat as off the beaten path for tourists.

Have not been to the restaurant for at least a couple of years. The standard is the same and food are awesome . Introduced the restaurant to my friends and they love it so much . The queue was very long. The staff are speaking too loud and the service is really average .

Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant Bedok There are so many eating places in Singapore. But if you are looking for a good restaurant for the budget conscious, ($ 20 /person) and to cater for a large and family group, you must try the Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant at Upper Changi Road. A good Singaporean friend of mine invited me for a Saturday night with his wife. Although not the prettiest of restaurants, you may not be impressed with the decoration, fairly if not very basic, but you don't go there for that. The place was so crowded that we had to wait for our table, after all This Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant is meant to be enjoyed for its very Asian food, mostly Cantonese not for its ambience .The variety offered on the menu is impressive. We ordered 5 dishes and all were absolute delight and very unique. My favorite dish has to be their specialty Sum lor hor fun (fresh fish slices stir-fried with rice noodles). The delicious fish slices were very fresh and tasty and blended very well with the beansprouts and hor fun which was smooth with nice wok aroma. No wonder it is quite a popular place amongst locals at night. Big plus also goes for the service is efficient, and the staff were friendly and thoughtful, and you allowed to bring your favorite wines and no corkage is charged but you must bring your own wine glasses. The public carpark in front of the restaurant is also big plus. I thought this is quite a hidden gem and would definitely return for more scrumptious Cantonese food again

Went there and ordered a few dishes. Food like fish bee Hoon was terrible as the fish was not fresh and the service honey lemon chicken was not satisfactory

If you looking for some decent Chinese food, this is not the place to eat. You may try the Lao Beijing which is near the same vicinity

We ordered 4 dishes which all introduced by locals.1. Huge Curry Fish Head: very huge and very delicious. Curry is not India style but taste very good(may be Singapore style), spicy with rich coconut milk.2. Fried Chicken Wing with Nam Yu sauce: very very very nice, juicy and crispy. Taste good even without the sauce. 3. Fish(without bone) Rice Noodle: The soup is sooooooooooooo rich~4. Baby Chinese broccoli: Good(no such vegetable available in HK, I eat a lot every time once arrive Singapore)The environment is crowded and noise. Dun expect too much on service or view. Expected that is a air conditioning hawker centre. For the Cleanness, OK.With Reasonable price, I will surely recommend this restaurant

This place serves one of the best Cantonese cuisines in Singapore. It is not posh, but down to earth and at least air conditioned. Not pricey and easy on the wallet. Cantonese dishes like prawn paste chicken and fish bee hoon with milk are splendid. Older folks like my dad enjoy the non-Cantonese dishes like Assam or curry fish head - he enjoys eating the fish eyes!

This place has many Chinese dishes at excellent value. It always seems busy, which is a sure sign of good food. We had cereal prawns, yam basket, chilli crab, fried rice and other dishes that were all authentic, freshly made and delicious. A great Chinese food experience.

We went to try this restaurant over the recent mother's day weekend. Ordered some dim sums, yee fu noodles and roast meats platter (char siew, roast pork and roast duck). The dim sums were ok. But the roast meat platter (which was the most expensive dishes that we ordered) was an absolute disaster for a Hong Kong named restaurant. The roast meat was hard to eat (unlike the other good ones that melts in your mouth), char siew and roast duck tasted terrible. DO NOT order roast meats if you are there but instead just go for the dim sums. Service was also poor - we had to ask twice and were very slow

Everything was quite average. There are some construction works outside at the moment but its not affecting the restaurant much. They wouldnt seat us inside because the empty tables left were all quite big tables. Fair enough. Food portions for the small were sufficient for 2 of us. We ordered black pepper beef, indonesian chicken, claypot tofu and beans with minced pork. The best dish was the chicken. But also had it better from sin hoi san. Claypot tofu had generous seafood in it inc fish slices, squid and prawns. None were bad but had better of each dish elsewhere. I would visit again because its convenient to where I live and probably try another dish instead.

I often eat here, as it's about 5 minutes walk from my flat in Singapore. I also take colleagues, and indeed took my entire family there whilst they were over for xmas.The food is great, the service is speedy enough, and the whole ambience just add up to make your dining experience whole.Sounds a bit gushing, but the place is just right for the food, the location etc. Try the wet tofu

Food here are not consistent, so there are good days and bad days (particularly when busy). Safe food include their fish "san lao" hor fun, + prawn paste chicken. Assam fish head was horrible. Today we tried HK steamed fish head $18 & yee mian $6, both were o

We were a table of 4 and ordered the fish slice bee hoon (soup), coffee pork ribs, prawn paste chicken, salted egg yolk prawns and a plate of veges. It came up to $22 per person- good value! The fish slice bee hoon was good, with a tasty, milky broth laced with a bit of alcohol. The coffee pork ribs was either slightly burnt or the coffee too overpowering. The chicken was tasty but they only serve wings. Salted egg yolk prawns were very good. Service staff tried their best but there was no queue system. You basically walk in and pray that you get a good waitress who would look for a table for you. If you get a waitress who's only busy with serving tables and not looking for tables for customers, you'll be left standing at the entrance for a long time.
