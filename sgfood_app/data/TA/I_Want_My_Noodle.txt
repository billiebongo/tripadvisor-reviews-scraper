I've been here several times and have always liked it. Noodles are fresh, fried chicken wings fragrant, salad is delicious and the sweet potato pebbles are a nice end to every meal. Not disappointed again.

Handmade noodles is quite chewy. Ambience is all right if u go at a non-peak period. It was full house during lunch on Sunday when I went. Service was so-so; slamming the menu on the table was rude. Servers cannot really understand English.

Noodles here were average tasting, but presented in new fusion concepts. Looks good, but basically hawker food at restaurant prices?

Nice location- good service. Noodles only ok/average. In a city with great noodles-- this is simply not good enough

We ordered two starters, wanton and chicken wings as well as two noodles, a chicken noodle with added char siew pork and a lor bak stewed pork belly noodles.Pork in wanton was too porky for my liking, chicken wings were average but the accompanying sambal chilli was delicious. My spouse liked his chicken noodles, mainly because he loved his noodles springy. My lor bak stewed pork belly noodles was average mainly because the pork tasted overly porky again and over use of pork oil and pork lard which makes the taste overbearing.As with the shop's name, the noodles are the highlight here. The service is minimal and don't expect service with a smile from the moody cashier lady

I did enjoy my meal here! First of all, the noodles are fragrant because of the sauces they used. A lot of umami, and plenty of joyous slurps! I loved the meats they used as well. Very juicy and tender. If you're in the neighbourhood, check it out

The highlights of our meal:– the lovely springy (QQ 弹牙 al dente), apparently handmade local ramen-style (i really wouldn't say wanton style) noodles, reminiscent of a local version of Ippudo (which is just upstairs and usually sports a queue). – the accompanying herbal (ginseng?) soup with radish slice, tasted nourishing and looked zen– the bona-fide Japanese style eggs that come in the noodle dishes: marinated ramen egg 溏心蛋 (ajitsuke tamago) and onsen egg– the (baby kale?) salad with a great (zesty?) dressing which begs to be integrated into a new cold noodle dish, cold summer ramen style!– the bona-fide fresh pork lard bits in the signature Lor Bak Noodle– and last but not least, the great value for money Choc Banana Tart on a salted crumb base. It might be a little too sweet for my taste, but the salt adds a great contrast and kick to this truly sweet ending.Not so great things about our meal:–needs better portions. The noodle portions tend to be small, particularly for the Truffle Noodles. I was done in what, I don't know, maybe four mouthfuls? I was definitely still hungry even after having a fried wanton and half a salad. Maybe the Truffle noodle dish needs more accompanying ingredients to make it more satisfying for the belly, eg shiitake mushrooms, oden-style fishcakes/sticks, cruciferous vegetables etc. The Lor Bak Noodle that my friends had were, in contrast, supremely filling, because of the copious amount of fatty protein and pork lard bits. A little jelak, in fact.–the lack of a soulful bona-fide minced pork noodle style local chili sauce alternative for spicy alternatives to the dry noodles. This could add more dimensions to the dry versions, which tend to taste one-dimensional. The pounded chili condiment on the table doesn't have body or additional dimensions, and is maybe more suitable for spicing up thai-style street food.–more variety in noodle selections. can think about doing more thai / indon / indian / malay variations, etc, to keep your customers coming back.–disappointed that the teh tarik/milk tea was just a lipton tea bag with condensed milk. It was really flat and had no body, really not worth the price of a latte charged for it. You need better heartwarming drinks to draw the coffee crowd! A good thai iced milk tea would be great, for example.Will come back to try the Double Roast and Duck Confit varieties, possibly

Get your hand made egg noodles here without the guilt of consuming maggi mee. Hee... Noodle texture is definitely better than maggi, more chewy and thick. Very generous helping of meat and soup is a delicious white radish stock. We also ordered some dumplings in wolfberry soup. I personally prefer wanton dumplings plain with just minced meat, so this bowl with shrimps and crunchy chestnut didn't entice me much.My second time here but due to high price and a lack of 'beckoning' flavours I won't return anytime soon

Interesting open restaurant; no doors nor walls I recall. Simple order and pay first noodle place with rustic decor and utensils. But noodles and food's anything but ordinary. The double roast noodle had more meat than noodle I reckon. The sesame oil green salad will make any veggies haters eat veg. Then there were meatball and wanton soup, and a duck confit of sorts, which can be torn easily off the bone. Will return

@TheKuoKnowsI'm not entirerly sure why the restaurant has chosen such an unusual name for itself. But it works. It memorable. So, too, is the food.The Noodles with Double Roast is quite delicious. It looks very appetising. In fact, it is quite hard to resist digging in, as soon as it arrives at the table.Some restaurants can do roast pork very well. Some places can do noodles very well. I Want My Noodles gets top marks for both.The Noodles with Truffle Oil is an absolute delight. I have never eaten anything quite like it. I only wish there was more of it.A salad never goes amiss with any meal. And I Want My Noodle makes a good salad that, for some strange reason, seem to be a perfect complement for the noodles.I Want My Noodles get the thumbs-up from me. It keeps things simple, and it keeps things real

Found this wandering the third floor of Shaw Centre. Tasty dinner for two for $30. I'd happily go again. Slurped down the handmade egg noodles in no time. My wife was even faster with the truffle noodle. No MSG!

I tried the Chicken Noodle and it tasted good. The price is quite reasonable in Orchard area. But the place is a bit secluded.
5
Hard to find but delicious and probably the least expensive meal you will have in Singapore Hard to spend more than $15 per person

The handmade noodle is really tasty. Done al dente. Assortment of dishes to go with the noodles. Small eatery. Highly recommended.

Another foodie friend asked me to go try out this place with her, after hearing a lot about it on another blogger's site. We ordered the truffle noodles, simple noodles and the big fried wanton.Honestly, didn't really fancy the truffle noodles. It had a very strong truffle smell that was not great to the taste buds. The simple noodle was just plain noodles - we ordered it to basically just taste the noodles without any "added ingredient" which we both decided was really not fantastic. If the noodle was left a little longer, it would be cold and not taste nice at all. The big fried wanton was nice tho.We gave it an overall food experience of between 6.5 - 7 I'm a little more generous! :) out of 10. But the ambience was nice though...and great service staff, thank you!

Went down to try their new menu, truffle infused olive oil noodle. Could smell the aroma once we reached the noodle house. Mixed the sauce with the soft boiled egg evenly before eating. The noodle was springy, aromatic and smooth. The pebbles (sweet potatoes balls) were still as good

Tried the noodles with my hubby and 2 year old daughter. Noodles were nicely springy and well done. Unfortunately that's the only good thing about this noodle cafe.The big letdown was the poor service; we asked for a small bowl for our daughter, but a big porcelain bowl arrived, and was placed unceremoniously on our table. The wait staff also served the wrong drink, and took it away without apology. When the correct banana smoothie arrived, it was served in a really tiny cup, completely different from what was depicted on the menu. My family would think twice before dining here again.

Been seeing this advertised everytime we go to the Cinema at Balestier - so decided to give it a try. It is at the Shaw Centre adjacent to the Shaw House Cinema by Orchard MRT.The food is fresh and service excellent. I tried their current special - crispy duck and my wife had the Prawn noodle. Both were very nice with the fresh ingredients coming through to tingle the pallette. The noodles were spring and very nicely cooked. Also had the meatball soup as a side - the handmade (i assume) meatballs were very nice indeed. Good value too - so will definitely come back

The highlight was the soup, smell nice and had light sweetness as it had white radish.As for noddle, I could taste the crunchy fried lard and the meat was tender, not oily. Portion was not too much, but at the right amount. Taste was not similar to those sold by most of noodle stalls at Food Republic, for instance. This one definitely had its own unique taste and worthy to try. Will surely come back

Chanced upon this quaint restaurant on the third floor of the newly renovated Shaw Centre, which brings you back in time to noodle shops of old. Self service at the cashier to order your food then it gets served very quickly at your table. The pork noodles were great with bits of crunchy lard to add a special touch. The roast meat in the roast noodles was a tad tough and the slices too thick but the chilli was spicy and fragrant. A bowl of soup comes with each serving and though I would have preferred it more piping hot, it was tasty and had a soft piece of white turnip too. The muddy lime juice and the lemongrass soda were perfect and highly recommended. Service was fast and thorough. Would definitely go back again.

Staff is very friendly and informative. Reasonably priced noodles, NO MSG!!! The decor of the restaurant is great.

Must try the double roast noodle
Remember to order the extra roast pork.
Chicken wings are juicy and recommended.
Try the giant fried wonton.
This is a real deal.

If you're looking for tasty MSG free homemade noodles this place is a must try. You can literally taste the freshness of it so noodle fans must come here to try! Also the banana chocolate tarte is amazing I couldn't share it with my friends!

The location is hidden in 3rd floor of Scotts Shaw building behind iSetan Scotts.We accidentally found the place while shopping at iSetan. The double roasted noodle is perfectly made. The broth is so tasty. Ice milk coffee is strong and good. The advocado smoothies is so good. The decor is based on old days. Perfect place to relax and enjoy the good foo

We decided to give this place another try, after seeing lots of locals eating here. The noodles are cooked perfectly - chewy and springy - and the sauces are full of flavour. The meatballs in the meatball soup are too soft, but the broth is very tasty (strange, because the soup accompanying the dry noodles is tasteless). The roast pork is moist and delicious. Service by young students is still pretty haphazard, and prices are on the high side for a casual eatery with barebone decoration, but you pay for the civilised environment of Shaw Centre

I decided to try the pork noodles on a rainy Saturday afternoon. After ten minutes, I wish I'd gone to the food court instead. If you want to pay restaurant prices for a basic food court experience than this place is for you. The service is bad (too grumpy students who throw a menu on the table and tell you to order and pay at the self-service counter). The noodles are no better than you'd get downstairs in the food court for a much better price and stools are hard and uncomfortable. I'm afraid I don't really understand the point of this place.

Having had many satisfying meals at Xi Yan Shaw, we thought we would give this noodle place a try. Must have been too early in the day, but service (by young students) was amateurish and most importantly, the food distinctly lacked flavour - only the giant won ton was good. Many hawker noodles are better than this one

I am a noodle lover, so I made a trip after reading good reviews about this place.Simple place with minimum dÃ©cor. Simple menu with limited choices. But all tasted good.We tried the meat ball soup, tasted very homely. The roast pork in the double roast noodle was so tender and flavourful, noodles very springy. Though the business was slow on that day, they still missed out my dessert order. Waited a while for it. But it was worth the wait, the pebbles (deep fried sweet potato balls) were served hot, crisp on the outside, soft inside
