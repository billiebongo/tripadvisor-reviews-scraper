I returned here for another mutton biryani last week. It remains my preferred choice for biryani in Singapore: real pieces of mutton and not too much fat. Hard to beat the quality. Pricing remains reasonable and friendly service.

In Chinatown, who would think you can find good briyani rice with mutton!
I've been taking visitors there for a while now and everyone likes it!
They would get 5 stars from me if only they would answer their phone and messages!

Its located right opposite to istay.inn and its a decent Indian restaurant with quite a few options. Good for you if you do not like the sea-fish oriented dishes in Singapore.

The service was good and in itself the food was good. Unfortunately, it did not hit my taste. Also my friends found the food only mediocre.

Keep on returning to this place whenever I feel the need for biryani. Last visit was last week and the quality was just as good as usual. Definitely my preferred choice for biryani in Singapore.

Came back here again recently for the mutton biryani. This is definitely the best biryani in Singapore: not too oily and not too spicy either, with the meat cooked just right. It's worth arriving closer to 12 to avoid the crowds and get a seat.

Almost authentic indian fast food. Mutton was cold, naan is okay. Average quality, good value. Could be much worse in the heart of the backpacker district but SG regulations keep it in a good shape. Could also be much better but there is no need because of the constant tourist flow

I was staying in the neighborhood and just craved for Indian food one day. I was glad to find this place just across the street from my hotel. Most of dishes are pre-cooked and I just pointed and ordered them. With rice and two types of vegetable curry, it was only about S$10, so it is relatively cheap. It also tasted decent and spicy enough

They justify the name, I was dying to have Indian food, saw the board and jumped in, initially everyone were reluctant to order, so we tried with Dal tadka with rice, it came I tested and "Heaven" that's the correct word. We tried fish, chicken nan and lot more, food was beyond our imagination. I insist if you are in Batam and are sick and tired of local food pls go and calm down you craving for Indian food. Although they dont keep beer but on request they arranged for us

When/if one gets tired of Chinese food in the Chinatown area.This Indian halal restaurant serves great home cooking, in a simple home feel place, and has a small terrace as well (which may need side protect). Good value to fairly low price. Great family style service

Don't be cheated by the smell when you pass by the shop. Rice is normal even ordered dum briani. No value for the we spent

We went for lunch to this place and we had some food like chicken tandoori, veg meal, fish biryani! The food was not bad but the place is too small and crowded and its self service. The price is reasonable too!

the staff is friendly. but the food is not delicious. the place is so cozy and clean. but the price is not so cheap. the mineral water cost $1.5

In a foreign country the most difficult problem is to get Authentic Indian food. And this restaurant came to my rescue. The food is very good..reasonably priced. A must visit.

Good Indian Muslim food. Tandoori, Chicken Tikka and variety of vegetable curries. Popular and convenient at the junction of Mosque Street and South Bridge Road in Chinatown

Small restaurant. Very reasonable price, if you compare with another restaurants of Singapore. Food are good and tables are neat & clean.

They serve the best Indian food with the authentic flavours. I tried biryani and it was just awesome. The cost is 6$.It's mild and flavorful.the place is just beside Jamia mosque on the corner. Nearest MRT is China town.

I have been to that restaurant many times for the last two years but my last experience was terrible. I am not sure If there is a change of ownership or they don't care about the quality of the food anymore.I ordered fish with rice, when I started eating the fish I was horrified, it was half cooked, I took it back to the counter and the server asked me to go back to my seat and he will take care of that. Anyway, I did not fancy the fish anymore so went back to the counter just to realise that the server was cooking the piece of fish I returned in the microwave.I asked for chicken instead, I got a small piece of wing and another small piece with bones, with same price as I paid for the fish.I felt sick after that experience and will never return back to this restaurant. In addition, the service is without a smile

Came back here again this week for lunch and opted for the mutton biryani as usual, supplemented with some vegetables, yoghurt, poppadums, dal and finishing with some tea. Quality was very good as usual and I still this is possibly the best biryani place in Singapore. I'll be back for more. Cost for the 2 of us was $24
