This was a lovely meal, albeit in a basement of a shopping centre - quick service, authentic Thai meals, very reasonably priced! Very good indeed.
5
Our meals were Very delicious and full of flavour. The service was quick and prompt and cleanly atmosphere. We had the Thai chilli chicken with rice and the Thai vermicelli noodles. The lime juice was fresh as well. Seating area was well tidied.

Visited the PasarBella branch @ Turf Club GrandStand and ordered Thai Basil Rice with Lemongrass Ginger drink. Very tasty meal, friendly staff & great service! I will come back again for more üëçüèª

Cashew chicken was so bad I could not take a second mouthful. Neither could my Singaporean wife. 10.90 for this!

If you're looking for authentic Thai food this place is not it. It's cheap, fast Thai food. Yo get what you pay for.

We ordered a seafood tomyum and a thai green curry for dinner and got delivery from foodpanda to our apartment. Just when I was enjoying my tomyum, and towards the bottom of the container, I found a giant piece of plastic in my soup! I was shocked and surprised how did they get category A for food hygiene

We go to this place every time we go to our favourite city SingaporeWe went there and discovered there were new owners and I am not sure how new.We ordered the chicken with cashew and a fried riceVery very nice, slightly different to what we normally used to get but still greatThe 2 x chicken with cashew , large fried rice and a coke was $34It is opposite Watsons on the river side of the centre

Located in the food-court basement of the Central at Clarke Quay the Thai Affair may not match the lovely locations of all the many restauranta along the Singapore River. But that is certainly made up by their well prepared authentic Thai food at very reasonable prices (well below half of the prices along the riverside).My favourite is their spicy papaya salad, the green curry chicken and then the mango sticky rice

Located in the basement level of the Clarkes Quay Central shopping centre, Thai Affair is in the food hall there. So good we ate there twice, great food at great prices. Avoid the restaurants and eat in the food halls for great food at half the price of the big places

Not far from the hustle and bustle of the popular Clarke Quay restaurants, this place is located within the Clarke Quay Central building on basement level 1, one of a number of eating establishments that form one of many of Singapore's Hawker's Markets.A Hawker's Market is not too dissimilar to the Oasis at Meadowhall near Sheffield in England, where you'll find a selection of outlets serving different types of foods - the main difference being the price.My wife has particular dietary requirements which can be difficult to get across in a foreign country. Armed with a picture of the foods she can't eat with a red cross through them makes it easy to get across the language barriers, and this was no different at Thai Affair.Not the most salubrious of surroundings, don't let this put you off - the food was excellent, served hot as expected, and tasted great.I can highly recommend the Tom Yum Mixed Seafood soup - whilst my wife can highly recommend the vegetarian omelette - both of which arrived promptly after ordering.$18.50 saw us both replete - a thoroughly enjoyable meal for two for just over a tenner - not bad when you consider the prices on offer on Clarke Quay itself, where we were looking at $35 -$50 for a similar meal.Top marks to Thai Affair - we're going back again soon and we can highly recommend it

Recently had a lunch special at Thai Affair. The staff were pleasant and helpful, the food was fresh and of good portions and flavour. Would be happy to eat here again.
4
Plenty of choices and wonderful shakes and other drinks. Green tea iced drink complemented the Thai curry perfectly. Price is attractive too!
4
Amazing $10 lunch had green curry, ice tea and spring rolls very well priced, ice tea too sweet for my liking but this seems to be the same everywhere in asia
Very spicy but beautiful food
5
Really enjoyed our authentic Thai meal. Me and my other half really enjoy Thai food and wasn't disappointed.
4
Nice authentic Thai food. Prices are relatively okay, without the Service Charge. The spice level though, I felt, was not high, probably to suit local tastes. Brought a Thai friend here and he was quite happy with the food, though the spiciness is not authentic enough haha!Nonetheless, it is okay, unless you want to spend more money at some 4star or 5 star restaurant. I would say this is ok price

I have been a regular to this place since the last 15 months now. Good food and helpful staff. They now have memorised my order and I just need to show my face at the reception :)Their basil chicken with rice is my favourite. Less oil & medium spiced. Minced Chicken is lightly tossed and has the right set of ingredients with no strong pungent smell.The rice quality is good as well. Their lemongrass and thai ice team are a good combination

We stumbled on this place whilst looking for a quick bite for lunch. Although not expecting a lot from a food hall outlet we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the friendly attentive staff. The duck curry was amazing, and the chicken and cashew was really good.The staff were very helpful and helped out some newbies to the Singapore food hall scene. We would recommend this hidden gem to any traveller looking for some good food near Clarke Quay who doesn't want to pay a small fortune for average food. Not easy to find in the basement of Clarke Quay central but absolutely worth the effort

Thai affair is one of our fav Thai joints here in Singapore.as my husband is allergic to shell fish..we ask for our soup and other fare minus the fish paste or sea food.the bbq pork is succulent and just tasty.....we had the basil chicken rice....yummy...phad thai ....and the Tom yum soup....all v well made and filling....the gal serving us has such a happy smile that u enjoy the meal...

Was there to collect some stuff over lunch time, saw this Thai Food place and went in for a quick lunch.Ordered the Green Curry Set meal, Rice with Green Curry - Chicken with Ice Coffee all for S$8.Curry was nicely done with lot of veg and chicken meat, it is also very spicy. For the price I paid, is value for money and it is better then some Thai food restaurant
5
Basement food courts usually offer pretty unspectacular fare but this place is way over par. Had the green curry and the seafood noodle soup. The flavours in both were very good - more like awesome - with a great balance of heat, ginger, lemongrass, etc. I'd definitely come back
4
This is one affair with happy endings.
Fantastic massaman curry at a very reasonable price. It is in the basement food court, so there isn't much in the way of ambiance, but the food makes up for it. You can also order a beer here.
5
Food quality is very high, price are very resonable, staff are kind, very clean and functional. The place is located on the basement of The Central shopping center.

Thai food is in my favorite foodlist ever since the world began. And this restaurant, is one of those that serves the best thai cuisine ever. Two thumbs up!
5
The basement of a mall in in singapore may not be the most beautiful place but often is having surprisingly fine quality food. This thai restaurant is having real authentic thai food, equal or better compared to most high end thais in singapore

We were looking for some dinner and I love Thai food and came across "Thai Affair" the service was fast and the food was fantastic. The kids loved every bit of it, but be careful it is HOT. The pawpaw salad was delicious and so was the pad Thai. We will be back.

Saw the big banner sign promotion of 15% off on total bill for BOC credit card. But the waitress insisted that its only applicable to Tom yum soup. And gave 2 credit card bills. 1 for the 15% on Tom yum soup n the other for the rest of the food items without any discount. 1 of the dishes ordered was green curry chicken with rice. The rice was not served with it and when asked for the rice the waitress claimed rice is additional charge of $1. So had to pay $1 for a plate of rice. The menu clearly states green curry chicken with rice. And what type of restaurant serves such dish without rice? Who would just eat the green curry chicken without rice??

I had looked on Trip Advisor for a good Thai restaurant in the Clarke Quay area and this was recommended.It met all our demands and was a simple but good and inexpensive meal that was authentically Thai with both Chefs coming from Thailand.It was a vendor based meal in the Central basement fod hall but I would certainly return and I have no hesitation recommending a good meal and probably the cheapest one you will have in Singapore so really good valu
4
Tasty thai food in this simple basement eatery.I keep coming to this place for weekend lunch again and again. Friendly service, clean, fast and most important: tasty food.They close quite early, so not available for my dinner schedule. This why it has become lunch place
5
I would highly recommend for anyone who loves Thai food and is a vegeterian ..We had spring rolls, Thai green curry with rice, some veggies ...Everything was yum.My 23 month old baby had quiet a Thai food experience.. she thoroughly enjoyed the spring rolls and curry with rice.To my understanding its a family run food jointThai Affair is situated inside the Central mall

Located inside Singapore's The Central shopping centre (right next to Clarke Quay), this clean little place offers a fairly wide choice of Thai dishes. We ordered the Tom Yum Soup with prawns, a Pad Thai (prawns) and a Green Curry. All were good and flavourful. The Tom Yum Soup was slightly different to what I'm used to, but in a good way. The prawns were pretty good, without being anything special. The Green Curry sauce and vegetables were delicious, with very flavourful basil. However, the chicken was pretty much tasteless on its own. Similarly, the Pad Thai's ingredients were all well-balanced and flavourful, but the prawns were just okay. All in all it was a great place for a quick and fairly cheap eat (plates are about $7-8, and beers are $6). I will emphasize on the "quick eat" aspect, since this is not a restaurant you want to linger in. It's very clean, you are served quickly, the staff is nice, but it's located in a mall and it's not particularly fun sitting there (like it would be at a hawker centre as a for instance)
5
Wow, this is a gem of a find at Central Mall basement. The food is very good and inexpensive
Will definitely come again

Papaya salad is a definite must. It taste exactly like how one will order in Bangkok or Phuket. The curry was fragrant. Minced chicken with basil a must try. The friendly service is another big plus.

Thai Affair is located in the basement Food Center of the Center City Center very close to Clarke Key. We went to Thai Affair based on the Tripadvisor reviews and their Facebook page and we did not regret it. I love Thai food and Thai Affair did not disappoint me at all. My husband and I shared 3 super dishes, all 3 tasting so different and as desert we shared one sticky mango rice. For all these plus water and tea we paid 36 sing dollars, amazingly cheap for the quality we had. Staff was were nice, prompt, smiling, only the owner was very grumpy at the counter ruining the atmosphere of the place. We made compliments to the chef and his helper went to the owner to say we loved the food, not even then he looked satisfied for the good job his staff do. Conclusion: food was excellent and if you have the luck not to see the owner there you will enjoy it even more ;)

cant beat the $7 lunch deals with $1 upgrades for appetizers but annoyingly very unattentive service. self service with order at the front but no one at the desk for 10mins. busy standing in the kitchen and sending out food but no acknowledgement to customers in queue. while i waited 4 people behind me went somewhere else.Food is ok, not great, and I usually come by once a wee
5
Well well well, I have a Thai foodie and always crave to have good authentic thai food. to top that, I am a vegetarian, so even more less options for me. Me and my husband happen to bump into Thai Affair last week accidentally. And gosh, the food was just excellent. I am usually very picky on smell and taste, even though restaurants claim they made it Veg, it still gives me a feeling something hidden underneath:) But this smelt and tasted heaven. The owner is so friendly, and she took special care to cater to our Veg requirements. She speaking clear english was another boon for us. We had Green Curry, Pad Thai (my ever fav), Fried rice, Spring Rolls, Lemongrass drink. Chef by mistake made our Pad Thai with egg, however was promptly replaced with another one. Each dish was so freshly made and tasted divine. And prices so affordable. I am darn sure this place will be my regulars from here on. Please keep up the good service...

This was one of those restaurants that I decided to dine based on Trip advisor reviews and also because I was staying nearby. The recommendations by fellow reviewers were spot on ! I chose Vegetarian Green curry with rice (special request made t billing counter) which was just brilliant due to freshness of ingredients, crisp and just rightly cooked veggies and hot bowl of rice. Serving was quite big and filling. Look no further if you are in this location - this place serves awesome fresh food and rightly priced

Just eat two menus because just both of us eat in there in the noon before go to Johor Bahru.The portion is so big,enough for 3-4 people.We ordered Tom Yam Soup and Chicken Curry.The taste is so great,the prawn in the soup is so fresh.and the chicken curry is one of the best chicken curry in Thai style i ever eat.At last,the price is very cheap for Singapore.Thanks to tripadvisor so i can find this nice restauran

The area around the Singapore river is a tourist trap, with numerous over-priced and under-performing dining options. You could pay inflated prices to sit by the river at Clark Quay or Boat Quay and eat forgettable food. We chose, instead, to retreat into the (pleasantly air-conditioned) basement food hall of a shopping mall and eat extremely well-priced, utterly delicious thai food, served with friendly hospitality. Everything we ordered was wonderful. Nothing was too spicy for our western palates. Highly recommended

UOB cards currently having a 15% off promotion on minimum $20 spend which is great as they already do not charge GST nor service tax usually! The service was good - our female server took the utensils etc. to our table. Tissues provided and bird's eye chillies. You can order at the counter or at the table. The food was fresh, not overly oily, nicely spiced to suit most palates and authentic. Only wish my papaya (Som Tum) salad had its peanuts ground instead of whole and some bean sprouts for better balance. The servings of rice (Fried Green Curry Rice) were BIG - enough for 2 women to share. Soup serving size was good for two with generous servings of meat and mushrooms - recommend you get a bowl of rice for SGD1 to accompany. If you don't specify you want pork, they will give you chicken for the soup. Try the Lemongrass Drink if you like lemongrass - it is strong and goes down well when the ice has melted. Clear and refreshing. Dessert SGD5, mains SGD7-8, appetizers SGD6-8 and drinks SGD2-3, if I recall correctly. I'd go back again. Look for it at the centre of the basement food court in Clarke Quay's Central Mall, near the cake in a jar shop. Access directly to the basement via the MRT. I wish more people visited this reasonably priced and comfortable little gem

I ate here one night as it was in the basement of the mall next to my hotel. I had a sore throat and the lemongrass chicken soup was great. I also had the pad thai which was also good except for the hot chili they sprinkeled on the top which I would have skipped. This was freshly made authentic food. The owner was very nice and the service good. The prices were reasonable. They also had alot of vegetarian options available
