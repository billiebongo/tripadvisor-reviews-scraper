I love the pasta as it’s freshly made. The texture and flavor is wonderful. The portions are very generous. I think this price is reasonable considering the quality and quantity. Service was excellent as well.
4
Food this time was so much better than my previous visit and the staff was very friendly, so kudos to them.
4
Value for money with the 1 for 1 lunch promo during weekdays. Food an service are decent. Definitely worth going again.
5
The signature pizza, penne and lasagna are real yummy! This place is definitely a favorite. Thank you too Nai, you made our visit very enjoyable.
5
The La Nonna pizza at the restaurant was spectacular. Pasta was well cooked although it was very saucy.
5
Enjoyed the Pizza and Pasta tremendously. Place was rather noisy but food was great! Will definitely go again!
3
Not much to rave about. Decent food. Location in Holland Village means that you can pop by pubs for a drink
5
Food was great, friendly staff, awesome ambience for couples on dates. Was unawaringly allergic to something in one of the cakes (not their fault) but the staff demonstrated exceptional service by giving us the dessert as complimentary. Thank you!

I went there with my Wife on the Valentineâ€™s Day for dinner. It was fully booked for the day. However, they were nice to offer us a table outside. We ordered one Prosecco bottle, a La Nona pizza and a risotto. Food was tasty and portions were sufficient. Overall we had a nice tim
1
Meal was very disappointing as the pappardelle that I ordered tasted nothing like it was homemade, but out of a box. Also, there was hardly any meat at all. The staff even dared to tell me that there's not supposed to be any meat, "as it is a ragu" thinking that I was a fool. Very disappointing.
4
Serving size of the dessert was not uniformly cut, my friends had bigger piece of cake than me, significantly different.
4
The la nonna pizza is still very tasty and delicious as I had tried before and I am quite surprised the spaghetti Bolognese was really good and nice.
5
Food and service was good.
Place is well decorated and there is also a huge oven where you can see pizzas getting cooked.
Atmosphere was marked down because of the packed layout and the sound bounces off surfaces making conversation slightly difficult.
4
Nice pizza place, good deal during weekday lunch with one for one offers. Will return in future. thank you.
4
Was a pleasant experience with great and service. The people serving the food were thoughtful and polite. Even asked if we wanted to heat up our food when it was cold. Great service and delicious food! Keep it up :)
5
Great Italian food and attentive & friendly staff. Brought my family to La Nonna for the first time & they love this place!
4
Had the parpadelle and ravioli. Quite well executed. The ravioli was with arabiatta which was too spicy so it didn't really sit well with me but that's my fault. Honest, proper food
5
We had their signature La Nonna pizza that came with a nice and gooey egg in the centre with lots of truffle! The crabmeat linguine and lobster ravioli were good and rich as well. The cod fish was really yummy too (: Overall it was worth it especially with the Entertainer app
2
It took 30 minutes for the chef to inform us that the gnocchi ordered cannot be served. Replacement risotto was rice in mushroom soup (which we had) with added cheese. .much too salty on palate . The Namly place outlet used to serve much better food. Sad it closed
4
Wet night and opted for something close . We did not have any reservations but was able to find a table. After ordering,, we requested to change , as music was blasting from both sides.We were abke to be seated upstairs. Food was reasonably prompt. Servers were as attentive as they can be. All were courteous and polite. Food was decent and price was okay.We had two entrees, a pasta and a pizza for a family of three.Magarita pizza was good. And squid ink pasta with seafood was tasty. Seafood portion was small though.ie prawns etc were on the small side.We ordered the promo prosecco for 35sgd that came with a complimentary appetizer. Prosecco was not bad at all. They do serve complimentary bread too. Overall a good italian restuarant
3
Staff were very polite, though they seemed a little short handed on the second level. Lobster ravioli was overly spicy and peppery. Other dishes were decent. Perhaps should have tried their pizza instead. The entertainer app or their lunch deal makes the food really affordable.
4
Who doesn’t love a great deal for a great meal? 1-for-1 mains on the weekdays. Been to the hv branch a couple of times and I love their pastas!
4
Food n service are good ! Restaurant setting is too cramp..seating too close to next table. Will visit again
5
Was here for a birthday celebration and it was excellent! We used the entertainer app and there was also one for one offers. Food was really nice and service was excellent! Thank you so much!
4
We have our team's welcome lunch with our new team member, it was a great place to lunch at. Especially for the 1 for 1 deals.
4
1 for 1 deal for pastas and pizzas on weekdays. Smoked salmon and la Nonna pizzas were great. Great service too.
3
The main courses are so-so. Their pizzas are much better as it's handmade and baked in their oven. Pastas aren't bad too.
4
The nera pizza was great, with a very crispy crust and generous portion of seafood. The pasta in aglio olio style, however, could do better by being less oily. Ours was soaked in oil.
However, the service was great. :)
4
Ordered their Gnocchi, lobster ravioli, tiramisu and torts al limone (lemon tart). Portion is reasonable for 2 pax to share with room to spare for dessert. Loved their gnocchi with chewy texture with tomato sauce. The ravioli skin was too thick, overall flavor was acceptable but not great. Lemon tart has too watery in the center for my taste, their tiramisu is great. Service is excellent and staff is very prompt and served fast when ordered.
3
Amazing ravioli. Pan-fried mozeralla was so soGenerous n yummy portion of free appetiters calamari that came with a nice bot of prosecco at 35bucks.was great and would love to be backBut..... The ventilation - cooking smells from the oven engulf the place. Not the kind of restaurant I want to go to walk out smelling like BBQ.Pls improve. I think u guys have great food n svc n I hope to come bac
3
Food was average, a bit pricey, should be able to do more as i had taste better wood oven pizza.
But waitress are friendly
5
Food was good for the price paid, service was attentive and friendly. Particularly liked the signature pizza and lobster ravioli was great too!
4
The food was generally good! Especially love the risotto as the seafood flavor was rich and delicious! Price may be a little high, but the 1-1 lunch promo made it worth it!
3
House wine was ok at 8 a pop. Pizza was larger than I expected but finished it. Kind of dry for the cheese. Non oozy kind
5
Overall great service and great food. Too bad they did not offer complimentary cake for my hubby birthday.
4
Food is good, but suggest to have more variety in the menu. Great place for small gatherings with friends
5
Every visit I've made to La Nonna has never disappointed. The food is always great and makes for a very satisfying and fulfilling meal. The Lasagna and Salmone e Rucola especially has a very special place in my heart.
3
La Noona signature pizza was nice and they do not skimp on the ingredients so thats great. Tried the crabmeat linguine as welll, works well with tomato based. A pity that the complimentary bread and cracker was hard and not crisp.
5
Went got the weekend one for one lunch specials. Had the salmon pizza and beef pasta. Both were delicious! Staff were very friendly too. Will definitely go again.
5
Fantastic food n service. Love the happy hour special of a bottle of Prosecco with a starter for only $35. Mains are generous servings that you could split the mains. Servers were attentive and were able to make good recommendations. Pizzas are thin, light and crab linguine is a must try. Good selection for vegetarians as well - a must try is the bruscehtta
5
I've been to la Nonna more an 5 times with different guests and it never fails to impress each time. Would strongly recommend
4
Get their signature pizza - it's the bomb. The parmagiana was great too. Service was excellent. Great place
5
Service was prompt.
Waitress was patient.
The food was also served promptly. The food was prepared well. try their dishes with cheese!
5
Had the 1 for 1 lunch deal and enjoyed really good pasta and pizza for half the price. Service was on point as well.
4
Prompt service, the La Nonna Special pizza was delectable, the lobster ravioli w pomodoro packed just the right spiciness. Am sure to come for a return visit!
4
Found this place on the web recommending their pizzas and we weren't disappointed. Their signature La Nonna pizza is yummy!
4
La Nonna's Beef Tagliatelle has been a long time favourite and has never disappointed. Crabmeat pasta is fantastic as well.
5
Had the risotto and la nonna pizza both of which were great as always. Had the lemon tart and tiramisu as well. Lemon tart was excellent
2
Nice location....... pasta okay but main course - Manza - unacceptable. Not tender at all and totally wrong sause. Was very cold in restaurant - food cooled down too fast so Pasta was cold ....When asked to to change this staff reacted fast and efficient. Had late dinner and were kind of pushed out the restaurant .......Expensive for average quality
5
Thumbs up to Raphael! He’s attentive and always with a smile, made our dining experience even better :) ps: he’s like a fashion photographer, offered to help us to take photos from different angles speedily.Food was good and reasonably large. 4 ladies ordered lobster ravioli, squid ink pasta, prosciutto parama ham pizza and truffle egg pizza. Both pizzas were thin crust. We also had white and red wines during the happy hour. We couldn’t finish the pizzas. La nonna served all the food at one go - absolutely the Italian service (and bonus for people like us to take photos! Haha). Raphael even took the initiative to off the aircon for us to light our birthday candles before turning it on again.Definitely going back again
4
i always have the la nonna pizza and it never disappoints. was looking forward to try their pasta - the veal ravioli which was just alright
4
Food waa good especially the pizza. Pasta was so so. Desserts was good took. Enjoyed the breads and dips
5
The food was great, and the service was excellent. My friend had the truffle pasta and I had the salmon. Both were done very well.
1
Expensive and dIsappointing for the quality. Definitely won't be back. Have had better quality Italian food for less. Pizza was low on cheese and dry. Eggplant parmigiana was tasteless.
4
Crab meat Pasta was something different and to our liking.
La nonna signature pizza was normal.
Unlucky that we dined during f1 weekend n couldn't use entertainer.
Staff was very attentive! Good speed.
4
Try the truffle pasta.
The food here is of good quality and service is great. The service is fast and the prices are reasonable.
In the heart of Holland Village, so also an easy to get to location.
5
Almost foods are tasty. Staff is very friendly and they have good hospitality. We would like to visit again!
4
Small cosy place with yummy pastas and pizza. However the risotto could be better as the rice was quite hard.
3
We were early for dinner on a weekday. Arrived around 6.15pm and there was only 1 other couple in the restaurant. We ordered the scallop risotto and crab meat linguine. The bread served was hard and not warm, which is a bit disappointing. The risotto was served in a flat plate which was not typical but my friend said is is nice though a little on the cheesy side. I had the crab meat linguine which was good with generous servings of crab meat. The service was fast but what I didn't like was that the tables were placed very close to each other so I can practically reach out and pick up items from the next table without much difficulty. We didn't order any dessert as the couple beside us was talking very loudly. There are seatings upstairs where the layout may be better. Price wise is quite reasonable. The meal costs about $62 including service charge and GST.
3
Spent a Saturday evening with some friends in this restaurant. The food was good especially the pizzas. The risotto was very (too much) creamy and the gnocchis plate was quite small.Don't expect fancy plates or mixes - it's quite simple but good and reasonnable for the prices
5
Love the atmosphere and food here. Would definitely visit again. Service of the staff were very good as well. Recommended.
5
Quite happy with the service, and the dining experience( we're seated indoors).
The price was quite reasonable as well
4
La Nonna offered authentic pizzas and pastas. They had a value for money set lunch for weekdays. The service was personal, attentive and efficient .
5
The signature La Nonna pizza is very worth it. We also had the oxtail pappardelle which was lovely. Pretty large servings as well
5
Excellent food and the service was great! Very value for money when you go for lunch during weekdays as they have a 1-1 promo for pasta and pizzas
5
Had my Anniversary there & was very pleased with the food & good service!
Food portion was a tad small thou. We had lamb & cod fish.
Calamari as starter is a MUST!
5
La Nonna has excellent Italian food as usual and with the lunch 1-1 promo, it was a really great deal!
5
La Nonna is one of my go to places for comfort Italian. Their lunch promos are also exceptionally value for money, and the service has been great during each of my visits.
5
We recently dined at La Nonna with our family or 8 on a Sunday night. We were seated on the upper floor of La Nonna's Holland V outlet, which was near full house that evening.La Nonna is not a fine dining experience but it provides a very homely experience to enjoy good, hearty, reasonably priced Italian food. I wouldn't call it no frills either - they have a classy, warm decor although the tables are placed in rather close to proximity to one another. Service was also good on the evening that we dined where the servers were friendly and attentive.For our dinner for 8, we ordered 3 appetisers - 2 servings of the Parma ham and melon and 1 serving of the Calamari Fritti. In addition, we had 8 mains which comprised of 2 steaks, 1 cod dish and 5 different pastas (including risottos). We also ordered a pizza to share although this proved too much for us and the portions were substantial. The pastas were particularly noteworthy - especially the crab meat linguini and the lobster ravioli. They are very generous in the portions of seafood and the sauces were flavourful but not over-the-top.Given the portions, there was certainly no room for dessert but the restaurant was nice (and attentive) enough to observe that we were celebrating a birthday and gave us a slice of cake! All in all, this was a very pleasant dining experience for good, traditional and unpretentious Italian food.

Food was actually really decent - but it was marred by the odd serviceOne waiter looked so absolutely bored out of his mind, that it almost felt rude to interrupt his wistful daydreaming. Another guy actually snapped at us when he was walking by, saying he'll attend to us later, with a proper scorn on his face. Alright mate, we weren't shouting at you or snapping our fingers - we actually smiled and said hi before beckoning you over. The same guy later came to our table and took our orders - or at least tried to. He basically went round the table, and somehow managed to skip 2 people sitting at the end. When we asked if he had taken the last 2 orders, he gave us a look of skepticism, as if we were pulling his leg. Hungry people don't joke. Anyway, so we told him that we wanted another crab meat linguine to be added to the order, to which he replied "there's already 2". Uhm ok, and now it'll be 3? Captain Obvious was still doubtful, and shot us skeptical looks. Must have been a shocker for a group of 9 to want a few pasta dishes, I don't know.Overall, service was dull, and a stick short of a bundle.Food was actually good - so if you come in with zero expectations, might not be too ba
4
Was late for the reservation and had to make last minute changes to it, but staff were more than accommodating and understanding. They were patient, friendly and service was amazing. Food was delicious and the location convenient from holland village MRT! Will visit again!
3
Ordered a meat pizza $25.8 and lasagna $23. Pizza weren't meaty enough but cheese was nice. Lasagna was slightly salty for my friend. Free bread was average but they served with balsamic vinegar.
Service was quick though water refills were not. Generally friendly and smiley.
5
Food were good, as usual! Got the tables on the 2nd level. However, after all food were served, there was no staff upstairs. Keep it up on the service!
3
We really loved one of our pizzas, but the other one just didn't work for us. Similarly we liked the crab linguine but thought the cheese risotto seemed to lack something.
5
Service was great and the food too! We were surprised by a birthday tiramisu on the house when we asked for the bill!
5
Food was served promptly and very yummy! Standard of the food is consistent everytime I go there for a meal! Nice place to chill too.
4
My 3rd visit and am happy to note the quality and service is consistent . My friend who is from out of town was impressed by the overall meal experience.

We went as a family of six yesterday - my wife and myself, our domestic helper and three young children. This was our first visit to the restaurant and we made a last minute reservation.1. We were given a table at the balcony. It was very warm and occasionally poorly ventilated. But we are not complaining as it was a last minute reservation. However, we were initially seated wrongly in the air-conditioned section by the waiting staff and were made to shift tables.2. We were given a generous basket of bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil (complimentary) which was appreciated.3. We ordered a total of two mains and two pizzas (average $25 per pizza) using the Entertainer app. The pizzas were good. The portions were more than adequate. According to my wife, the cod ($32) first was decent but bland. My steak ($36) was undercooked - I ordered medium but it arrived rare. I can accept that it may be difficult to cook a good steak - especially when it's a thin cut of less than one inch and most chef err on the side of caution. As, I had already eaten part of the steak (two small parts by the edge of the steak which were not rare) and made a big cut on the steak to demonstrate the doneness of the steak to the waiting staff, I find it totally unacceptable that the steak was recooked instead of being replaced. 4. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT THE GRILL HAS GOT SALIVA FROM ALL THE PREVIOUS DINERS THAT HAD THEIR STEAK RECOOKED? I have been to many restaurants - most of them would get their doneness right the first time. For those that didn't, they would gladly replace with a new steak. I could recognise that it was recooked based on the big cut that I made on the steak to demonstrate the doneness of the steak.Otherwise, service was good. Waiting staff were polite and responsive.Would I go there again? Maybe. Would I order a steak from La Nonna? Probably never ever. Overall poor value despite the 1 for 1 from Entertainer due to the horrific steak experience
4
Food - We had their weekly special Ravioli with truffle oil and for dessert, of course being an italian restaurant, we tried their tiramisu. I would definately come back to try their other dishes.Service - Was average. My friend ordered a glass of Red wine but the staff poured a White instead. Atmosphere - Even thought it was a weekday, the restaurant was packed for lunch. I was glad I made reservations and had a good feeling that the food would be good since the place was full.But it was a little noisy. 
4
We were going for a Sunday brunch, with a reservation and also called the restaurant to be sure everything is fine. Despite the call there was no Sunday brunch anymore and we had to order from the a la carte. We had pizza salmone, lobster ravioli, lamb racks among other things. Everything was prepared very well and the best part was the dessert. The only thing to complain is the sudden disappearance of the Sunday brunch and the high price to pay for the food
3
Its a good place to have gathering, although food serving time is slightly long but overall nice environment
3
Pretty average Italian quality food. Not good but isn't that bad either. Prices are affordable for the quality.
4
Booked this for a Friday night for my girlfriend's birthday. Service was great and Food was excellent. Holland Village gets pretty bustling on Friday night so there was a nice atmosphere as well!
5
We were surprised to see the 1-for-1 weekday lunch deal. We had the pasta and pizza; and the meal was awesome. 👍
5
Great food - pastas, pizzas and especially the mains. Even the appetiser bread was warm and fluffy. Barely managed to stop myself from asking for more.
5
The food was awesome especially th la nonna pizza. The service provided by the staff were professional
5
the food at la nonna is really good, especially for the price during weekday lunch with the 1-for-1 sets
5
Was treated to amazing Italian food! Great ambience as well; service needs slight improvement, but would definitely de back again :))
4
Was out with my girlfriend's little family including her 2year old daughter for my birthday. We had a voucher that could only be used on non-promotional items in the menu and staff were kind enough to split the bill for us. Food was great and service attentive. Pleasant experience indeed
3
The burrata cheese starter is just so good yet the pasta I had was not. The steak my wife had was so so. Bad choice maybe. We chose to sit outside which turn out to be a mistake. The pub next door was pumping out loud music which We didn't like. The service staff was not very helpful either.
1
The food portion was generous, and the food was tasty. However the service was a major disappointment. I wonder if it was because I was using the Entertainer App. Without the app, I wouldn't visit again.
4
It is a nice place for a small get-together, or celebration. The service staff are attentive and the food portions are generous. Overall, a pleasant experience.
3
Nice place for dining but not cheap for the food and drinks. Drinks promo is until 8pm. Din manage to try the wine, but alots of people ordered the wine. So I suppose is good. Food portion is good for sharing among friends.
5
Went in for lunch and they have one for one for mains, pasta and pizza. Tried their mains previous. Nice! This time we tried their pizza. Good too!
4
Was there for dinner, very good service though Holland Village is not a favorite for romantic dinner. Pizza crust was crispy from center and out, perfectly done in the wood oven.
Portions were quite large and prices average.
4
This restaurant is located nearby Holland Village Mrt, very accessible. the ambient of this restaurant is very cozy and it is crowded during dinner time. Staff is friendly and served us ice water and top up frequently. We went there to celebrate friend birthday, had ordered pasta, pizza and pork chop. There serving is consider fast since there are many people. The pizza especially, is very delicious, we have ordered meat lovers and their signature La Nonna pizza, tasty. Highly recommended to try and the price wise is average
4
My family of 5 were there to celebrate 2 of my children's birthday, We went for the Sunday brunch which gave us an opportunity to savour a wider range of food. Overall the food were tasty and serving size was good, value for money. We paid extra $8 for the cod fish main but was worth it. We ended the celebration by blowing off the candles(which we brought along) on the tiramisu.
4
A lot of people think this is an Indonesian restaurant because of it's name but it's actually an Italian. None of the staff I've seen are Italian but they are friendly, accommodating and fun. La Nonna offers 2 for 1 lunches on weekdays which are great value, they also have a good 3 course set lunch. They offer a bottle of Prosecco with a plate of Italian sausage for S$35 from 6 to 8 pm and all you can eat family brunches at weekends. Well worth a visit
3
Our shared starter was the plate of cold cuts and this was disappointing. The quality of the cold cut meats was not what we would expect from a good Italian restaurant. I had their scallop starter as a main and this was very good. My partner had the steak which I'm told was fine to good. The deserts were Ok. Overall, the service was good and the overall feeling of the restaurant was fine. Lots of folks were having pizza's - perhaps this is their specialty
5
I was there to celebrate my daughter's birthday. The place was packed as it was a Saturday night and there were only 2 waiters serving the whole of the second floor. I could see they were stretched as one table after another called for them. But I would like to compliment the male waiter who continued to be extremely polite and cheerful, and even acceded to my request to put a candle on a cake for my daughter and sang happy birthday as he brought it out. The food was great as expected (it was not our first time) but the excellent service stands out
4
The staff were attentive and made several good suggestions for the food items. We had the Mozzarella E Parma for appetizer which is tasty. The pizzas were of good standard. Overall an enjoyable evening.
4
Ordered the smoked salmon pizza and the truffle oil pasta. both were hearty portions. ambience was conducive to enjoyment of the food too.
5
Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday and the food was really good highly recommend their la nonna pizza
4
We had the lobster ravioli and their signature La Nonna pizza. The ravioli was very nicely done, with decent filling size and a well cooked skin. The pizza was fragrant with the truffle oil but was a little on the bland side.
5
Pasta was good. Waitor was nice and allowed us to move to the second floor. Great value for 1 for 1 lunch deal. recommend linguine
4
The food taste amazing and the lady who served us was very helpful. However, it was a little bit slow to get her response as she was the only one who served on the second level. I think this place can use more manpower. Since there were ten of us and we were celebrating our friend's birthday, it is pretty normal that we were slightly loud. We had a complain from other customer due to our noise level. So it would be better to get a table outdoor if you plan to come in a big group.I would recommend this place for the pastas and pizzas. Will definitely come back for the food
5
I had been here regularly since 5 or 7 years ago. Would visit this place when I have a craving for good italian food. I've never been disappointed with the food here. The service staff are generally friendly, attentive. One particular male staff is also very humourous. :) Food is usually served rather efficiently. Outdoors seating offers some music from other bars/ restaurants nearby, and occasionally some cigarette smoke. Indoors seating offers quiet environment, ideal for catching up or for a quiet meal
3
Having eaten in the Namly Place La Nonna for years, we tried and were disappointed by the Holland Village branch (which is rated much better on tripadvisor, oddly?).So I suggest you go the Namly Place if you have the choice - much better service, food and ambience. And although it's close, it's not walking distance. 5 min by car.We had calamari, a bit chewy, caprese, ok, pork chop in brown(?) sauce was nothing special and light on sides, crab linguine was decent and our daughter had a tasty 'red' pasta. And while the wine list has a bottle from every Italian region, none of it was decent quality, especially for the price. I couldn't find anything worth drinking on it.I wouldn't recommend this place. Curry Hut next door is better. Or drive to Namly Place La Nonna branch
5
Been here many times and quality remains as always. I only recall very few restaurants in SG with all three courses being superb! Entree wit classic Bruschetta, mains with pasta penne and signature pizza. Finishing the lunch with the chocolate fudge ice cream dessert. Each dish deserves high rates. My wife and her family (Italien from Tuscany) confirm authenticity in taste and menu. If you sit upstairs you forget being in Holland Village. Only recommendation: a bit less olive oil in the pasta dish. Staff attitude is lovely and above average friendliness in SG
4
La Nonna (The Grandmother, in Italian) serves traditional Italian country cuisine much like what granny would prepare. We went for a family dinner one balmy Saturday night in April 2017. For starters, we ordered Bruschetta. The goat cheese served on the dish was absolutely lip smacking. For main course, we ordered Gnocchi and spaghetti bolognese with minced meat. The portions were a tad small but the sauce was outstanding, the pasta perfectly done and the mince meat just the right amount of tender. We also ordered some Bira Moretti beer, a tad crude and harsh on the palette and did not go well with the dishes. Service was stretched but did not too badly. Reservation is advised
4
We had the special pizza, salmon main course, truffle pasta and crab meat pasta and 3 coffees for the 4 of us. Bill came to $120 with the 1 for 1 lunch promotion.
4
Comfortable environment to catchup with friends with quality Italian food. The lunch promotion is value for money!
3
Place is convenient and easy to locate. Service is good but the food is so so and expensive. Will visit only if there is no other choice.
5
Our daughter gave us a lunch treat during a 1 for 1 promo. Pasta and pizza were great. Main course not bad too. Service was excellent.
Weekday 1 for 1 lunch promo is $26++ for a 3 course set meal. Really great ambiance.
4
Went there for dinner on a Friday. Baby pork ribs is nice but steak is normal. Nevertheless, great service from the staff! Would be back again.
5
Food was awesome, esp the truffle linguine. Generous serving of food. The complimentary bread was served hot. Restaurant is having 1-for-1 promotion for weekday lunch.
5
Had dinner at La Nonna last weekend. Food was good - my companion and I love the La Nonna Pizza and Ravioli.
4
Service staff were friendly and attentive, i like the cosy ambience. Specially love the lobster ravioli!
5
All the service staff at La Nonna were very attentive. The food came in good time and the service staff came to check if the food was okay. Water was filled without having to ask. Quality of food was also very good. One of the best experience I've had.
5
The restaurant is located at Holland Village. The staffs were very friendly and service oriented. One of the staffs knew that it was my brother's birthday and served a chocolate mousse dessert with candle, which I greatly appreciate. The food was truly Italian. Strongly recommend their pizzas
4
If you're looking for quality handmade pastas that won't break the bank, this is the place to be. Service is great, too, with staff being friendly and attentive. Will return!
3
yes I love the squid ink pasta!
great selection on the menu.
a little cold in the restaurant.
but yes it is yummy!
4
Loved the la nonna signature pizza very much, though ours was a little too burnt at the ends. Also, we waited 30-40 mins before our pizzas came! Would have given a 5 otherwise ~
5
a lovely afternoon lunch. My 12pm booking came in handy as the place was filled bt 12:15pm with the office crowds making a beeline for this Italian restaurant. 1-for-1 lunch on their mains (pizza/pasta) is def a HUGE draw!
4
Well balanced and freshly cooked pasta. I dont think the drinks are entirely worth it. But the pastas are a must
3
This place used to serve really good food but I find that it isn't as good as it used to be.
Crab meat linguine still taste pretty decent but the Nera pizza aren't so.
4
Had dinner for four seated upstairs. My order was missed somewhat. When we asked, staff explained that the order was missed and offered a free entree instead as the other three were mid-way through heir main. Great recovery.
3
My hubby and I used to love this place for it's food, ambience and service. But unfortunately, I think the food standard and service level has dropped. Our pasta were tasteless and service took too long. Perhaps we came on a busy Saturday night that's why we had that experience. But one issue that made me quite unhappy was my call to them earlier in the day. I called early when the restaurant just opened to ensure that my reservation was confirmed. Instead of giving me a confirmation, the guy over the phone made me repeat me reservation details - from my name to reservation time, number of pax, etc. It felt like I was making a reservation rather than confirming it
5
We stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for a birthday place in Holland Village to celebrate a friend's birthday. We got to discover the place via The Entertainer and we weren't disappointed. Food was good, prices very reasonably priced. The service rendered especially by Whitney was outstanding. She was attentive, warm, friendly and never complained despite the fact that she attended to a lot of tables. It seemed that she ran the entire operation of the restaurant as she was very busy but she kept her composure and beautiful smile. They even sent a tiramisu with a candle for our friend's birthday. It was delicious. We're very happy with the experience and we will be back.TIP: a bottle of Prosecco with free Italian sausages for SGD35++ from Sunday to Thursday.

Unlike Chip Bee Garden across the road, Holland Village itself seems to have been taken over by pubs and drinking holes, with La Nonna (The Granny) being one of the relatively few remaining full-service dining establishment.The atmosphere is homely, and service was prompt and cordial. Being a vegetarian, I was initially wondering whether I would be limited in my choices to just salads. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the list of primi (main courses) included gnocchi (I wrongly pronounced it as "knock-chee", but later found out that the correct Italian pronunciation was "ngeok-key").Gnocchi is supposed to be a traditional Italian staple comprising dumplings made of potato. In La Nonna, these were served in a thick, tomato-based sauce that was flavourful and went well with the slightly springy dumplings. That was the only dish I had, which was sufficient for my dinner.Their lunch specials stated on the restaurant wall look interesting, There are various options to choose from, and seem to be good value for money. That is probably a good strategy for the restaurant to attract lunch crowds from places located further away.Their pizzas are supposed to famous and popular, so families or groups of friends/colleagues can consider ordering different varieties to share and try (those were the two predominant groups of diners I noticed). The tables inside the restaurant are arranged quite closely together, so if one prefers to have a romantic dinner date, one may wish to have a table at the terrace instead for an al fresco dine and wine experience
3
The pizzas are as good as ever while pasta dishes were dissapointing. Perhaps the kitchen crew wasn't having a good day there.
5
The staff was really nice and alert. Food was good as well. Really nice atmosphere especially when sitting at the 2nd floor.
4
The waiters were very attentive, we love the pizzas ( ingredients are generous) , however we hope some improvement in the potato dumplings.
4
Though at the time of dining, the restaurant was undergoing some renovation as their oven caught fire a few days back, their place was neat and we can dined in comfort. The food was nice and filling.
4
Easy reservation for a sunday afternoon.
Good pastas and portion. Pizzas not available though. Well done team!
4
Nice comfort food thats reasonably priced. My fav was the scallop risotto which was cooked to perfection. Absolute yum! Will def return :)

Went there a few weeks back with an old school friend for dinner. As most of the joints at Holland Village seemed to be restaurant cum bar (which we didn't want), and it was starting to rain, we popped into La Nonna.Overall, it was a good choice. We found the space to be a bit cramped, but seeing as this was in Singapore, where space is always at a premium, one can't really blame the owner for wanting to maximize the seating.To start off, I had the Carpaccio. Thin slices of beef tenderloin were served raw, together with truffle dressing, walnuts and Parmesan cheese. I have to say it was superbly done and for me, it was the highlight of my dining experience that evening!For the main course, I had the Risotto Allo Zafferano. I thought it tasted pretty good, although nowhere closed to the pleasure I had eating the Carpaccio. I think dialing back a wee bit on the buttery cream might be a vast improvement .....All in all, we managed to make ourselves comfortable and it turned out to be a good dining experience
5
I ordered the Oxtail ragout pappardelle, and it was absolute comfort good. The breads served before the main course tasted oh so good I wished there were more. The 1-for-1 offer is good value as well. I ordered the Nerra pizza, and it hit the spot
4
Loved the calamari, lightly battered, nice texture and NOT dripping with oil. The calzone and crab linguine were great and at decent prices too. Service and atmosphere were average of what you find in typical restaurants. Nothing to rave nor complain about. Would come back for decent comfort italian food. :
4
The food at La Nonna is value for money. Portion is big and fresh. We were served some choc tarts as part of set lunch and asked for exchange to something non choc and they gladly served us lemon tarts that looked like crÃ¨me brulee. It was yummy and we ended the meal on high note.
3
Food was above average for Italian food. my boyfriend and i had the crabmeat linguine and the lobster ravioli. The food was tasty and the ambience was a good place to chill.
3
Service was poor, orders got messed up, so food arrived slightly cold. Bread was served to some tables, but not others, and only served together with the food, instead of at the start.
2
disappointed with our first time dining here, the food was substandard and the waiter kept making sarcastic unecessary jokes.
3
Food was ok. The service was good. Joe a new staff for a week, did an excellent job. He's attentive to our needs.
4
Food was good and price was decent given the 1-1 offer. We all enjoyed our pasta dishes and my niece enjoyed her squid ink pasta very much. Only nit is that my penne pasta with chicken and sundried tomatoes was a tad on the salty side. Service was good and staff provided some light-hearted humor
3
Visited La Nonna on eve of xmas, service was professional and staffs were friendly and helpful in introducing their menu.Ordered a Calamari and mushroom soup to start, both were excellent.Had lobster ravioli was slightly disappointing, fillings were not fresh, pasta was undercooked, sauce in my opinion was awesome.Pizza was great, thin crust, not too saucy,chef was generous with the ingredients.Overall, i will visit again
4
Had an impromptu craving for Italian food on a wet Christmas night and was recommended by La Nonna by a close friend whom has been a regular customer over the years. We ordered the taglierini truffle, ravioli, lasagne and one of the pizzas for 3 person sharing and they were heavenly delicious.The taglierini truffle had a balance taste of cream sauce with truffle, which I truly appreciated. The dish was not overpowered with either of the main ingredients - something that most Italian restaurants out there were able to produce such a balancing act.The main stream items of lasagne and ravioli were up to the mark as well - amongst the best I have ever tasted. Pizza was on the average side which I couldn't find any fault but it served as a good appetizer before the main courses arrived.Overall an enjoyable Christmas meal on a rainy night with tip top services from the crew as well. Definitely will be back in the near future soon
4
The service of the night was on point and excellent, from taking orders to ordering suggestions and serving the courses. The server had a good sense of humor and took the effort to joke with us, which turned the order-&-serve routine into an impromptu conversation. Excellent
4
La nonna pizza effuses with the scent of crisp and fresh truffles the moment it enters the dining hall. Simply exquisite. However, the waiter forgot our order and we had to wait almost an hour before our food was served. The manager was genuinely apologetic for the slip up (kind of typical Italian style) and we were given a complimentary side of fried calamari to go along with our orders.
2
I would not rate the place as authentic italian restaurant. The holland village restaurant is not even clean. Had to request change of plates because was dirty. There was no olive oil on the tables as well and the pastas were e tremely average.Not authentic Italian food. Not coming bac
5
Very good service, friendly and professional servers, ambience is good, food value for money, overall great
5
First time at la nonna but definitely not my last! The food was good (ordered the pan seared salmon, cod and Signature la nonna pizza) - they were all beautifully done and delicious. Service staff was very welcoming and pleasant. 5*
5
Especially with the one for one lunch deals on weekdays, this place is a great bargain for everyone. Plently of food choices to choose from.
3
We waited for our food for one hour when there isn't much crowd. We assumed server forgot one of the order. Overall food and service are good.
4
One pizza is enough to share among two pax. My friend and I ordered a mix of Salmone E Rucola & Salsiccia. I really love the Salsiccia and wouldn't mind to come back to try other flavours. Service was better than the previous visit.
5
We had a lovely time great food and good service. The staff went the extra mile to help us celebrate a birthday and it was much appreciated.
5
My girlfriend and I visited the restaurant for the first time, the service is really good. We ordered the la nonna pizza and linguine. Mind blowing! It was really good. The pizza is juicy, cheesy, flavorful. I'm salivating typing this now haha. The linguine as well, yummmmz. Okay nuff said! Try it yourself! (
5
Great for casual dining of authentic Italian cuisine. Food was served promptly and the service staff were friendly and humorous. Both my partner and I had unintentionally finished a whole bowl of Parmasan Cheese for our dishes but the service staff offered us more cheese to go with our dishes seeing that we have finished the cheese in the bowl. Definitely worth it to make another trip there!
3
Went for dinner at La Nonna early on a Friday night. The waiter who seated us didn't say a word when we asked for a table for two, instead pointing to a table with two seats outside. I ordered the penne pasta with chicken, sundried tomatoes and pesto sauce and my friend ordered the creamy tomato lobster linguine. The penne was delicious but was sitting in about 5mm of oil. My friend said the linguine was tasty but also a bit oily. It started raining towards the end of the meal and we had to get the waiter's attention and ask them to roll out the awning as we were getting wet. They also didn't clear our plates when we were finished eating. We ended up shifting them to the empty table beside us where they sat until we left the restaurant about 20 minutes later. The food was nice but I won't be returning to La Nonna because of the bad service.
3
We were at La Nonna for a celebratory dinner, for which the ambiance and service were just perfect. The staff is terrific - smiling and warm, and we had an excellent wine recommendation! The food, on the other hand was a downer. We had a Caprese Salad (which was the best of the lot, the cheese was fresh and the salad was well dressed), Penne Arabiatta (very average, it was neither spicy nor flavourful), and a Mushroom Cream Linguine (super bland and just no flavour, the mushrooms just didn't pop)
4
We have a good time with my family, the restaurant is quite cosy, but lvl can be quite hot. Best to request to sit at the second floor! the risotto was nice and big portions.
4
The food was good. The air conditioning doesn't work well though, we were perspiring inside the restaurant.
5
We got carried away and chatted away until past 10.30pm (sorry). Staff didn't chase us out (thank you). The linguine, risotto and meat lover pizza were satisfactory. I felt the squid ink pizza was a tad fishy.
4
We ordered the lobster ravioli and veal and both dishes were excellent! Coupled with the entertainer coupon, it was a fantastic deal. The ravioli was stuffed with fillings and the pasta itself tender.
3
Food was pretty pricey and some people may only find it worth it to visit with Entertainer or during 1-4-1 weekday lunches. Food was alright, a little salty. Signature la Nonna pizza was good. Crabmeat linguine was full of good flavour but the sauce was not thick enough for my liking.
5
my Chope reservation was not captured by the restaurant, but the manager and his staff were still most welcoming and made every sincere effort to vacate a table for me when they could. two thumbs up to the service here and I'm coming back for sure. didn't get the manager's name but definitely a role model for the food service industry. well done guys! signature truffle pizza was superb. don't miss it! and their 1 for 1 on all mains, pizza and pasta was an excellent offer too
4
We had our team lunch at La Nonna on the 2nd floor of the restaurants a few months back, and it's now one of our executives' favorite dinner places. Their 2nd floor is a nice private area, good enough to fit around 30 over pax with comfortable space. Overall, good food, of cos, but the serving time is pretty slow. It would have been better, if they allocated more staff on level 2 for this big team lunch, since we prebooked a few weeks before. It took them 20-30 min before our drinks are served. Well, saving grace is the 1-for1 lunch promo which made it worth the trip
5
Their signature pizza with truffle is worth trying. Portions are pretty generous and they do live up to their price tag. We tried the baked lasagna too and it was good, good portion too. Beer is cheap too at $6/bottle during happy hour!Service is prompt but a few waiters were rather clueless. Will be back
4
Food was served promptly and service was efficient. The only downside was that the staff did not clarify that cheese toppings had varying prices and the final cost was greater than the $1.50 stated on the menu. Would be good if they could remind diners of the additional cost (on top of the $1.50 add-on price)
4
Spur of the moment to visit this restaurant I normally just walked past. Very good services with surprisingly good selection of Italian food. My experience was made better by a good Prosecco that paired quite well with the crab linguine and their signature pizza - La Nonna, a tomato-based pizza with toppings of truffle and asparagus.
4
Yummy food. The signature pizza is a definite must try! Conveniently located near Holland Village MRT.
4
The service was excellent except for the part they forgot to bring the wine but they brought it eventually. Overall will definitely go there again
4
Good basic fare and child-friendly staff. Prompt service. Lively place with simple decor, not romantic.
5
Had the la nonna pizza and the ravioli and was pretty decent! When we came during dinner, the place was half full and the service crew was attentive. All in all a reasonable dining experience
4
Great service with prompt respond from the team. Thumbs up for their La Nonna pizza and daily chef special, veal ravioli!
3
We tried the linguine pasta with crab meat and pork chop that were highly recommended. Somehow the pork chop tasted salty and hard. Not that fantastic. Linguine pasta is average with overcooked spaghetti . The 1st floor temperature was hot even aircon and fan is turning on. This needs to improve so to enjoy more. Service was great with very friendly waiters and waitress. Overall experience is good but food wise is average.
4
I went there with 3 other friends. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We tried the crab meat linguini and lobster ravioli. Good quality of food. The desserts were great as well, i really enjoyed the tiramisu. If you have an HSBC credit card, you can get a 15% off, and it makes it really worthwhile. Definitely a great place to eat if you are at holland village area
3
First floor of restaurant is pretty hot , air flow is not good at time when inside the restaurant. Should add more air con and not letting eater keep sweating.Food is good but small portion, only two waiters attended to customer at peak time, consider pretty slow. Expecting a better service with the price it charges
3
"La Nonna" Pizza - a tomato based pasta topped with asparagus, an egg, and truffle. The pizzas here are cooked in a wood fired oven, making the base and crust rather delectable. The toppings were simply but reasonably well done - the asparagus soft but retaining a little crunch, with a mild truffle flavour.Parma ham and rucola pizza - nothing special here. Just your average parma topped pizzaOxtail (?) ragout pappardelle - the oxtail pappardelle was decent, though I couldn't tell whether it was simply a beef ragout or actually oxtail. A note about the pasta here is that they seem to have a very slight heaviness and stodginess, though not extremely offputtingPenne with chicken and pesto genovese - the worst dish of the afternoon. The penne was undercooked, leaving it too chewy and unyielding. Pesto was very (almost too) light on the basil flavour, and too salty. It was speckled with olives and sundried tomatoes, which was nice. The chicken too was underwhelming, being boring slices of chicken breast.Service was rather unattentive, even with the slow lunch service the 2 waiters did not take the initiative with filling water etc. Can definitely work on the whole 'italian' ambience - the only semblance of which was excessively loud and unpleasant italian music piping through the speakers
3
Food was alright. Calamari is way over priced for it's quantity and quality. Pasta and Pizza are alright, nothing fantastic. We were at the first floor indoor area, there are only 2 service staff running both inside and outside areas. Took a while to get my bill.
4
Food was good value and tasty. I would recommend the venue, especially for lunch we they have a 2-for-1 offer
4
Always a good choice for business lunches as they offer one for one and the pasta, services is good.
4
Went there to celebrate my bf's birthday! Service was prompt, was brought to the 2nd level which was air-conditioned. However, hoping that the Spaghetti wasn't that drenched with olive oil but it was still delectable! 😊
4
I had ravioli and it was fantastic. Food was served pretty quickly. Servers are very nice. It was quite difficult to get their attention to order and pay, though. I wasn’t in a hurry so it's no big deal.
4
1-for-1 lunch deal is amazing! People should totally check out this place for lunch during the weekdays!
5
Love the their lanona's pizza (truffle) and many others. Nice atmosphere however it can be a little cramp. great service with great value too.
4
Enjoyed the food. Has always been a fan of la nonna at HV. However they are slightly understaff, besides that everything was really enjoyable.
2
food was decent but took 30-40 mins to arrive. It was hard to get the attention of the service staff despite having already been seated. Took us a while to get our table (with reservation), the menu, bread, water and food. All in all, a whole lot of waiting during lunch.
2
We arrived - ignoredWe wanted waiters attention to order drinks - ignoredWe wanted to order - ignoredWe wanted the bill - ignoredWe wanted to pay - ignoredWe wanted our credit card back - ignoredThey weren't busy either. We were the only table outside and inside was half full. The wait staff were just bad.Pepperoni pizza was good - we'll above averageCalzone had cheap supermarket packet ham in it. I'm sure Nonna didn't cook that way. It's a good location. The service was just rubbish and they knew it too. They were embarrassed when I pointed it out (loudly) and half the restaurant nodded in agreement. They were more interested in themselves than their customers
3
I booked through Chope for Friday Easter brunch special and I was disappointed with the dining experience there. The Chope reservation did not indicate that the package was for two or more persons and imagine my disappointment when the server told me I can't order from the Easter menu since I was just one person... after I had ordered from the Easter menu. There was no apology given as well so I just went on ordering risotto from the a la carte menu. To be fair, the food is alright though the price is a bit steep but the level of service was simply not there. My experience convinced me that this would not be a repeat visit in the future
4
Pasta was good, although I prefer it to be served warmer though. Overall service was attentive and acceptable!
3
Decent Italian food at average prices.
Neither economical nor luxurious it's suitable for a weekend dinner treat.
1-for-1 lunch deals on weekdays but haven't tried yet.
Service staff are prompt.
4
Good, wholesome italian food. The service was prompt and the food was flavourful and good.
While my date liked the crab meat linguine pasta, I very much liked the baked eggplants with cheese.
4
The place is crowded even on a weekday night so better to reserve. Good food and service! Try their signature La Nonna pizza
4
Loved the pesto and sun-dried tomato penne and my friends enjoyed the spaghetti bolognese. Recommend the restaurant thought it can be a little pricey. The food is fresh and has simple Flavours. Very authentic Italian :)
4
The food was lovely and the service was really good. Recommended for a romantic date or cosy family dinner.
4
Would be better if water was served promptly without being asked when guests are seated down and refilled. Overall food was excellent and staff was friendly.
4
Love the pastas at La Nonna. My favorite is the Shrimp Fettuccine with saffron. Their pizzas are good as well. Service varies.
4
Heard this place has been around for many years so we had to give it a visit. Did not have an entree but the desserts were pretty good. Tiramisu did not disappoint
1
Decided to venture into Holland Village while holidaying in Singapore. Decided to try La Nonna for dinner and will not be returning anytime soon. We definitely started on the wrong foot when we found a long thick black hair in our entrée. The waiter was apologetic, but then joked about it when serving our next dish. The rest of the meals were average. To be honest I have tasted more authentic tasting meals out of a packet from a supermarket. The experience was quite costly coming to about SG$ 130 for one entrée to share (with bonus long black hairs included), two mains and a half bottle of wine.I don't think I'll be returning.
4
It was a quaint little place with good ambiance and our food was served with us really fast. Definitely a place worthy of the price you gonna pay for good italian food.
3
Tiramisu is very good.
Great Price! $39++ per pax which is very affordable.
Service is slow though.
One plate and one glass broke by service staff during the 3 hours I'm there
3
one for one lunch deal is good, food is good too. but service needs to be improved. location of restaurant is convenient
3
1 for 1 lunch is a great deal, though I wished the veal ravioli was as good as it used to be! ......
4
Celebrating a simple wedding. You can rent the full floor (max 20-25 persons) including a small veranda. The food was delicious and traditional Italian. Wines and water authentic Italian. All guest have been impressed.
5
Had a nice light lunch today, their salad special. Right in the pedestrian zone of Holland Village. We got there as it LA Nonna opened. Within 15 minutes, all tables were packed with patrons. Speaks for the quality and value of the food.
4
We have been here several times and it is one of my favourite places for Italian food. We are vegetarian and all their vegetarian dishes are excellent. Service can be a bit tardy at times but once the food arrives we are all happy again!
1
Went for lunch where they had a "buy a pasta or pizza get a second free". Got the bill and was charged for all pasta and pizza. Questioned why and got dirty looks before they fixed it not before a 20 minute wait for the bill to come back. Managed to see the table next to us also didn't get their second pasta free. If you're going to offer a promotion then offer it. Service was slow and inefficient. Food was ok at best
4
First time we went to this place and it was far from disappointing! Very nice ambiance, interior and Italian music playing in the background. Ordered the brochettes and the lamb rack. Rest of the family pizza and lasagna. All were freshly made and food was hot when served. Lamb could have been more seasoned but the garnish made up for it. All other food served was more than delicious. When make reservations for a romantic dinner, ask for a table at the balcony.
2
They advertise themselves as "Italian food the way Grandma made it in Italy!!"Maybe grandma cooked so bad that they all ran far far away to Singapore.A detailed and insightful review below..Net Net -- OK service / Bad ambience / Bad food.....Ambience -- BADThe pictures in the website (which look like a heritage shophouse or bungalow) have no resemblance whatsoever to the actual restaurant. Someone said - "A picture can tell a thousand lies" and this picture does.The surrounding area was not the quiet green area that we expected from the website. It was instead very reminiscent of Pattaya walking street minus the shady parts of course -- buzzing with hordes of people in shorts and tees. The actual restaurant is crowded with a distinct college canteena feel (not in a good way) with tables so close to each other that you can hear the entire conversation of the neighboring tables. There is no rustic feel the way grandma would have had. Lighting is too bright and no soft music or ambience to speak of.Service -- OKWe had reserved our table in advance but when we arrived there was no one to greet us. So we stood looking around goofily for about 5 mins after which I decided to take things in my own hands and walked inside to accost a waiter. We finally got our table but wanted to change it which the management kindly obliged -- but alas we got placed at a table with the dreaded "loo view". Seriously, no one should be seated bang in front of the loo door. I didn't like the starter at all and they agreed to replace it with something else which was a plus. I found one aspect of the service geniunely Italian though -- Throughout the dinner you get a feeling that in a past life, the waiters were all henchmen of "The Godfather" Don Vito Corleone -- As deadpan as they come with no one smiling even once during the entire service. Food -- DEFINITELY NOT GRANDMA'SThe starter was "supposed" to be grilled octopus salad. And bam -- out came half a can's worth of cold tinned octopus shreds with a bunch of rocket leaves. I returned the dish and refused to pay. Canned food for SGD 17?The replacement was a sea-food soup which tasted good enough but the best food critic in the world could not guess the contents as everything was shredded - even the prawns..The main course of Lamb Rack was tough and chewy -- at one point my knife slipped trying to cut it.Final Advice - Give this place a miss and go to Burlamacco in Amoy Street which for the same money will give you a super fine dining experience
5
Food is consistently good. The woodfired pizza and creamy pasta never fails. Go for the delicious crabmeat linguine!
4
Been here so many times because of their lunch deal. The food is consistently good but the service? not always.
3
It's a cosy restaurant, just right for our family of right. The truffle pizza was amazing. We had the beef, lamb and cod fish too which were cooked just right.
4
1-for-1 during lunch, worth the value ordered 2 pizzas lanonna pizza is tasty and delicious : ) will come back here again
2
The worst Italian meal I have had in a long time. Lasangne was tasteless. My wife thought the soup was nice. Overall very poor.
5
Being back at this place twice in two weeks says a lot about the quality of the food. Their signature La Nonna pizza is a must try. I guarantee you you will be wishing you had four stomachs like a cow to eat more of it in one sitting. Their soup of the week is awesome too!
3
I've dine at La Nonna several times in the past few years and it has been consistently good. My visit last evening however was somewhat disappointing in terms of food standard. We ordered the crab linguine and the seafood aglio olio - the pasta was barely al dente and taste was mediocre. Al dente pasta is the basic I expect from any respectable Italian restaurant, so I was really quite disappointed. We also had the signature la Nonna pizza which came slightly burnt on one side and affected the edges of 2 slices of pizzas :( Taste was still good as I remembered it to be but the burnt bit was really not pleasant - if I were the staff, I would not have allowed that to be sent out of my kitchen. I may come back again some time later to see if things have improved as it has been 1 of my fave restaurants in Holland V, but for now, I will be taking a break and hope they will sort out what went wrong.
3
Ordered the Mozzarella Parma as the appetiser and my friends and I didn't quite enjoy this. We expected the cheese to be soft and oozy but it was hard. The Parma ham overwhelmed the taste of the cheese and was a tad over done. Had the La Nonna signature pizza and Crabmeat Linguine as well. Both were decent and hit the right spot. Service was good and the waiters surprised my friend with a Tiramisu birthday cake although she was too full and declined dessert. But it must be great cause she finished the entire slice of cake. If you hate noisy restaurants, you might want to book a table at the Alfresco area as we had to move outside when a big group came in. They were loud and the low ceilings didn't help.
3
This is mostly a generic Italian restaurant in the Holland Village neighbourhood. Though the traffic in the area has gone down, the good eateries can still fill up quickly on the weekends. We chose La Nonna because it still had a table available (which should already have been a negative sign). Nothing wrong with the food overall; it was alright, if not inspired. Quite functional - and hence, a but pricey for what you are getting. Still, the one dish I would recommend is the (cheesy) bruschetta, which was a notch above the usual staple that you find in other restaurants
3
La Nonna in Holland Village, Singapore It was our second day in Singapore and after spending a long day in the Botanic Garden and visiting the Raffles Place we needed a simple, but decent spot to have our dinner. On the recommendation of our friends we decided to go to the Holland Village. The restaurant La Nonna was just the right place. Not too large, rather tight in respect to the seating space but neat. To start with, we ordered the Fish soup and the Pumpkin soup. Both were tasty and we looked forward to our next orders. The Pizza “diavola” was indeed spicy, almost too much; however the Risotto was well flavoured and also the Ravioli tasted well.After all, we have enjoyed our meal and wouldn’t mind to come here again
