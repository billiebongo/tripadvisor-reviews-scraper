I cannot emphasize more how amazing this place is. Stumbled upon it through a friend's recommendation, and would strongly encourage anyone with a sweet tooth to go and pay a visit. Their tarts are absolutely amazing and decadent. Their GWC (Get Wasted Chocolate!!!) tart and nutella/rocher cheesecake is probably the must-try for first time visitors. Their menu varies slightly. Do check out their Instagram or Facebook page for updated daily menu
