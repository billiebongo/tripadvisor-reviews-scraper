It is value for money as a dinner for two with BBQ combo, fried tofu, two drinks and two watercress soup only cost $24 in total. The BBQ meat is nicely marinated and the service is fast.

One of my favorite place to eat good char siew that has the roasted favour. The shop offer many other dishes and soup beside the roast duck and char siew.

The ambience here is an open concept and be prepared to come early for seats as its first come first serve basis.The portion and quantity of the food is good enough and the price is reasonable for this neighborhood eating place.The quality of the roasted meats are good and succulent enough with the generous amount of sauce and the chilli sauce that goes with it.Great place for lunch or dinner in large groups but have to come early to get seats

This restaurant has been for more than 20 years but it has changed location before.I would say that their roasted meats are definitely better than average. Considering the price, I would say that it's good value for money. Should try their noodles which is the typical Hk style noodles, springy and full of texture
