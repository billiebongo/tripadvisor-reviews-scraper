The luncheon meat fried rice at this restaurant is simply delicious. And the price is pretty reasonable too. Service is not bad too.

Food was really yummy and comparable to top chain restaurants. Dongpo rou is a must try as the meat was really succulent and not really fatty. Service was pretty great too!

I am a vegetarian,however this review was important for my carnivore Hubz "wink,wink" I opted for Avocado snow white and Hubz jus couldn't stop ordering...taking his feedback and views i am writing this review.We ordered: Pork Rolls,Pork Chops,Pan fried Dumplings and much more that i don't remember now.All i could see was the flavor when they started hogging(eating is just too small for a word)...the red chilly oil combo beats everything and anything in the world(hubz says so)

Ordered a number of dishes. The menu seemed to be different or changed from the usual Asia Kitchen I had in the past at ION and city link. They do not have the famous duck dishes. The steamed siew mai was too big and below standard. The fried curry noodles was tasty but would be better if it's less oily. Luncheon meat fried rice was flavorful. I like the fried kailan with mushroom the best.

This restaurant is not on Harbourfront Walk as TA asserts but down in the basement of Vivocity Mall.We had an S$28 one course measl of sliced duck and bok choy along with chicken chops fried rice.The quality was excellent, as were the drinks of cranberry juice and a dragonfruit shake

TripAdvisor insists on showing the location of this little restaurant as being on the Waterfront.It's not. It's inside Vivocity mall, at the first basement level, along with plenty of other restraunts. Vivocity is on the Waterfront, which is probably the reason for the confusion.If you want to eat at a family restaurant which serves a blend of Chinese -Singaporian food, this is the place. It's a comfortable functional eatery, with long wooden tables and hardwood benches, set close to each other to accommodate maximum number of people, happily eating their way through steaming bowls of food: a bit noisy, but hey, you're in a Mall& not out for a quiet romantic dinner.You come here for great Chinese food cooked Singapore style, & that's what you get. I love their Xiao Long Bao, the delicate dumplings, with translucent skins that almost reveal the morsels of meat and soup within. I rate them the second best in Singapore- the best Xiao Long Bao are at Din Tai Fung.This time, we had egg fried rice with crispy chicken on top, and a bowl of kai lan , stir fried, with their crunchy stocks and deep green glossy leaves.They do serve chinese tea, but the problem is it comes in large glasses & not the usual small mugs. So it tends to get cold if you plan to sip it with your meal. And they don't top up your glass, as is done in most chinese restaurants. Also, I usually avoid their desert- its too colourful & vivid for me.Whene er I'm in Vivocity, this is where I like to eat
