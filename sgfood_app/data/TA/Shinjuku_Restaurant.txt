Great for a late night Japanese meal. Usually packed with many locals and tourists even at 11pm. Food is on the pricey side but portions are just right especially if you plan to share with someone. Many items available on the menu and do make sure to check the whiteboard for food and drink promotions.Ingredients were fresh and service received was good

What a better indicator for a superb restaurant then visiting multiple times the same week you've first entered. What a fantastic place to eat, both at the tables, bar and traditional Japanese stye in the private rooms. Sashimi was just as tasteful and fresh as you can imagine

Its a small restaurant , kinda constrain for 2 big size fellows.I ate the sushi and salmon set , the salmon was prepared really well and the sushi's was good. Kudos to the chef , while my friend ate the udon with tempura....he didn't say it was bad. Really loved the sushi...very liberal with the ginger and wasabi, even the wasabi taste spicy and not stale,We enjoyed , nothing wow about the service

I have always felt that restaurants in malls can't be that good but Singapore is fast changing my mind. Cuppage plaza on orchard road host many Japanese restaurants. Shinjuku is a small but cosy restaurant on the ground floor. The food is standard Japanese fare, tasty and most importantly reasonable priced. They also have a small bar that is well stocked with Japanese malts. This is not a high end or gourmet restaurant.
