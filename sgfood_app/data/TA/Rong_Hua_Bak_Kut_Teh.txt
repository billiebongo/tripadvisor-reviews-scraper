Good and quiet environment. But most items are out of stock. We order 5 items and 2 has sold out so we have to reorder again...foods are nice..
3
Long queue and waiting time more than 15 mins. Food good. Storage of manpower hence waited quite long for our food.
4
Like the hot bah kit teh soup and the fritters. We love the side dishes too.
Service is also very good.
4
Decent and value for money. Service was fast and good. Will come back again with friends in the future

Ordered normal pork ribs soup and dough fritters. The soup is tasty but not fantastic. The dough fritters were quite good. There are usually seats during lunch time and the order is out to us within 5 min.

Just across River Hongbao we found our hunger delightfully satisfied at RongHuaBakKutTeh Marina Square. A variety of flavourable soups were served piping hot with extra refills too, matched with fragrant white rice or mee sua. Side dishes like fritters and salted vegetable made it complete. Special receipe dishes like deep fried prawn rolls, smoked duck, char-siew, braised pig intestines were also a steal. Ending the meal with warm lychee tea complimented very well to what we ate. Restaurant ambience is warm and inviting & staff were prompt and attentive too. We'll surely be back for more

Had my lunch at Rong Hua Bak Ku Teh yesterday with my colleagues. We all agreed that the soup was excellent and so are their chef recommended items. Friendly staff were very attentive to refill the soup and comfortable ambience and will definitely come back again

Often frequent BKT places when in Singapore but this place does not warrant a good rating. On the plus side, the restaurant has a nice environment and prompt service. On the down side, the food was rather mediocre. The soup had a weird after taste and the rice served during our meal wasn't cooked enough. Certainly room for improvement
5
Doesn't know what to eat for dinner and came across Rong Hua Bak Kut Teh at Marina Square.Had tried many other Bak Kut Teh and for now, this is my favourite.The food tastes good and it's super affordable. The servings are considered a lot as compared to other brands of Bak Kut Teh. I really love food businesses that are not stingy when it comes to food servings!Service is excellent. Soup is refilled for us 2 times without us asking them to! And I realized they didn't charge customers for the wet tissues. Thumbs up!Also, there are quite a lot of varieties of food to choose from in the menu.Will surely come back for more

Food was excellent and waiters were really friendly and courteous.Unfortunately, that all was in past tense; today the service was really sub-par and the fried chicken we order had quite a bit of feathers on them.We alerted the waiter but she insisted that was flour, I know because I consume fried chicken on daily basis. :(I had to pluck out one strand but after that all she did was put me on hold, later telling me that they will "take note".Dang son that day I was one plate of fried chicken poorer and left with an unsatisfied craving

Best bak kut teh in Singapore and JB and some say Bintan. The meat falls off the bone by just looking at it.
4
Set meal was affordable and nice. Free refill of soup upon request. The taste is more to peppery and good for cold weather
4
Bak Kut teh is very tasty especially the pepper smell for the soup is strong enough and weekday lunch meal is very worth it
4
Came here on a rainy day! It was a great meal. Love the soup here. And the youtiao is a must try! Crispy and chewy!
4
The braised meat is nice and juicy. The service is prompt and tge lady refill the soup on her own without asking .
4
came with my wife . Share a pot of tea. The premium pork ribs is superbly nice. Take this over the normal one. Will come again.
4
The soup is pepperish and it tastes good. The service is prompt . The you tiao is nice and food is served hot. We enjoyed it.
4
tried the set lunch pork ribs BKT, it's really good. The garlic flavoured clear soup base taste just right and soothing and not salty & peppery, The ribs are nicely cooked till tender and without the porky taste.
3
Ambience is good, food is decent. Has quite abit of variety thou. Quite a family friendly place with adequate pushing spaces for prams and plenty of child seats
5
The one dish that stuck to me throughout the rest of my stay in Singapore was the signature dish from Rong Hua Bak Kut Teh. It is one of the best! The meat was just so tender and well cooked and the soup with the white pepper and garlic is genuinely enjoyable and tasting very good, you can even ask for unlimited refill of soup at no cost :). Really good food, staff are attentive & friendly and ambiance is very nostalgic making it a great spot for date's night, for family dates and even for business/group dinners. Definitely worth visiting
4
Food is decent and staff are friendly. Nice and quiet place to come especially during lunch. They have other dishes other than bak kut teh too.
4
The food is good and tasty. Generous with their meat too. It is most definitely worth to come here when in Marina Square.
4
The place is really nice and service is superb. Meat was not overcooked. The only issue however is that the serving is a little small.
4
Ordered their signature pork rib bak kut teh at marina square. Soup was just nice, not too peppery nor salty. The fried dough fritters is crispy and quite a generous portion for regular size. Recommended.
5
Food taste great. Will come back again. Excellent service. Clean environment with good selection of food
4
We visit the outlet at Waterway Point regularly. Service is always good and food quality is also good. Prices are reasonable.
4
Friday dinner@ marina square. It was not too crowded and the lady is quick to point out soup may be to spicy for my kids.
5
Love the hot peppery soup and the tender pork ribs. Must also try their hometown chicken, crackling roast pork and honey baked char siew. Yummy! Excellent service too! :)
5
Had good meal here, great service and friendly staff. Ping Theng and Joycel were very helpful in recommending what to have with our orders and the tea as well. Worth a visit.
5
Famous brand in Singapore that did not disappoint. A small menu of tried and true dishes which were tasty and well priced. The pork rib soup was excellent with waiters coming regularly to replenish the broth. So many dishes we wanted to try but as there were only two of us we have to leave them to another visit.
5
Good food and nice staff ..for those who are coming to visit Singapore!your Singapore experience won't complete if u never try this .
4
Great food, and very friendly staff :) will recommend the BKT with the salted egg yolk wings--must try! Kodus to Jocel for giving the extra mile. Will definitely come back
5
The food is excellent and there's value for money. The service was good too! We will visit more often here for lunch or dinner.
5
Affordable lunch sets. Good service. Very nicely done braised intestines. Aunties were very efficient in refilling the soup.
3
Famous for BKT but I find pork over cooked n soup a little saltish but the chicken feet was yummy . Service excellent n they kept re filling your soup without request .
4
Good service, food came quickly, attentive staff, always taking initiative to refill the soup. Quiet place, good for short gatherings.
4
Ambience there is nice. Service is good and the food is great too. I don't recommend to order the ice tea. Barley is okay.

I had been dinning with Rong Hua Bak Kut teh for a number of times. The soup and the dishes had been always good. Just recently in June, the taste of the soup had change. The pork meat was hard and tasteless. I am quite disappoint that the food had been become good to bad
5
Soup is tasty and flavourful. Peppery and spicy. They allow multiple refills. So it is very worth it.The hometown chicken is crispy and well marinated. Tofu is worth a try too. Tofu texture is very silly and the sauce they use is a good accompaniment for the tofu.
5
Food is delicious and reasonably priced. If you have a group of 4, it's highly recommended to go for their deluxe feast. Very value for money and ingredients of TOP quality. Impeccable service from staff who are always attentive and go around to top up the soup frequently
4
Soup was tasty and peppery. Meat is tender too. A bit too peppery for my taste buds. Staff are prompt and efficient.
5
We always order the BakKutTeh adding something (pork, tail, or stomach) so we could taste both ingredients. Free refill for the tasty soup. Worth going.
4
The staff were helpful and friendly and accommodated our requests for an additional bowl of soup :)
The food was good - the meat was tender and the intestines were well cooked. All in all, worth a second visit!
5
Have try a few Bat Ku Teh restaurant.. love the taste of Rong Hua food. Nice and friendly people too.
5
Ronghua's bak kut teh was simply fabulous. The broth was bursting with flavour and the pepper added a nice kick to the whole soup. It is one of the nicer peppery bak kut teh I've had in Singapore! Very affordable priced as well!
5
Soup is rich and peppery, and the meat falls off the bone. It is soft and cooked well but not overcooked. Recommend to try.
5
Good Bak Kut Teh, prawn roll and dough fritters. will definitely come back for more. Prompt topping up of soup.
5
Good variety . Friendly staff .I love the soup and veggi very much it's very spicy and I had 4 serving.
5
Was looking for a place to have some "me" time for lunch.
Chanced upon this place with the $7.90 lunch promotion .
Absolutely love it
4
Enjoyed the lunch here, one of the better bak kut teh I tried. The soup tasted good, can ask for top up. The premium ribs were a bit over done at certain parts, though still tender. The dough fritter still retained the crisp after being soaked in the soup! The pig stomach is super tender, easy to chew. Great service too! Waitresses were friendly and prompt in response. Recommended
5
This is an excellent value for money and nice dishes for a no frill dinner if you buy the Groupon voucher. Highly recommended!!!
4
Tried the outlet at Waterway Point. We ordered the promotion set with fish, bak Kut Teh, vegetable, pig trotters which was more than sufficient for 4 person. Like the soup which allow to be refilled non stop.
5
You must try their char siew recommend for you guys. Bak Kut Teh @ Fusionopolis ambiance was good. You enjoy eating as you see other people enjoying eating their dishes. Pork Rib is one of the best also comes with unlimited soup.
5
Simply love their soup;fragrance and spicy. Their pork ribs is tender and their signature toufu is a must try.
5
We ordered the standard pork rib dish with all the sides. The soup is delicious and the meat falls off the bone. The best side dish is the braised peanuts which are slightly crunchy but full of flavour. The staff also provide free soul refills to allow you to enjoy more of the flavour.Gets very busy at lunchtime on a weekday due to the office crowd so suggest visiting off peak
5
I am a bak kut teh person and rong hua know how to make it well. They offer two types, one normal and one premium. Be sure to get the premium one, you will not be disappointed. Everything is priced affordably. Service here is also excellent, with the service staff frequently coming over to top up your soup. Other than the bak kut teh, you also have to try their fried chicken wings and the salted vegetable. I will definitely recommend this place!

The soup is the peppery one. They are generous with their soup, of course. Will fill for you non stop if required.We ordered the liver, kidney, spare ribs (of course), mee suah, veggies, haey zho (prawn wrap?!) and you tiao (the fried dough or fritters). The rest of the dishes were all ok except for the fried dough. It seems so "powdery" and soft, so it did not taste nice with the soup Neither would we eat it on its own. So, you tiao was no good. The liver and kidney were all ok. The oyster sauce veggie had way too much fried shallots on top!! Hahaha... it was as if they were trying to clear stock!! ;)Overall, quite nice food in a mall

"Just visited Rong Hua Bak Kut Teh @ wate­rway with my family last weekend. The por­k rib was tender, soup was authentic. The­y even serve prawn roll which stuff with ­chestnut. Overall the price was reasonabl­y cheap for family meal. Will visit more often with my family.

Almost every week, I will come here with my colleagues. They have set lunch which we feel that it's quite worth it and attract us. Usually, we will order the pork rib bak ku Teh soup set lunch comes with either you tiao, biased peanut or veg. Most important, every $20 spent you will get a chop on the promotion card. Hence, you can get certain items for free when you get the X number of chops. I love to spin the wheel and hope to win $80 but always no Luck. :)Their staff was very friendly and helpful. It's always long queue especially Friday. Procedure: Queue for your turn to be seated, pay for your food and wait for your food!

This outlet is located at the new Waterway Point. It is highly accessible by mrt n buses. It is quite convenient to drive there except there is a 10min queue to get inside the carpark. Carpark fee is standard rate like many of the Fraser shopping centre This outlet is located besides Best Denki and opposite the M1 n StarHub outlet. Strategically it is a good location to draw crowd from the well known brands located within 5m from this outlet. The premier rib is worth the price and the overall selection is great in price and portion. The tea experience is one of its kind and you probably crave for more. Overall verdict: very good food n staff experience
