Plenty of meal sets available. Just renovated, so it looks bright and clean inside the restaurant. I received a cute toy teddy bear after my meal as a grand opening gift.

It's at jurong area. Food is not bad. I ordered teppanyaki sirloin, teriyaki chicken, chawanmushi. Portion is reasonable. Service is ok. I went for dinner. Ample parking space. Menu have quite a variety. Have some promotions.

We went as a family of 5 to this restaurant. It's a little out of the way if you're not living in the West. But the 50% Eatigo discount was enough incentive for us to make the trip.What a delightful experience for us. We were very pleased with the variety and the attentive service, particularly by the petite Indian waitress who was very efficient.We will be back!
