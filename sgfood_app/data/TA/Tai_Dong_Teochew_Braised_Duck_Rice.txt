Has been following the stall from city to neighborhood. Traditional Teochew style braised duck. My favorite dishes: stew cabbage，猪头肉，猪耳，豆干. I also ordered the duck for reunion dinner and it's one of the dish cannot missed.

It is worth making a trip to this hawker centre to sample their traditional braised duck rice which is served with other dishes to make it a balanced meal. Owners are friendly and open to requests, but do note that they close once everything sells out

My whole family and big bunch of relatives had this duck rice since the 1980s. The taste today is exactly how it taste like many years ago. The dark gravy is superb, duck meatis tender and juicy. Not forgetting the soft 3 layer pork meat and a plate of cabbages to lighten your taste buds. Slurp.
