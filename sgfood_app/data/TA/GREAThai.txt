Tomyum was just spicy enough. Fried squid was crunchy. Stuffed wings were tasty. Mango salad was really good.

Nice restaurant. A large menu of Thai dishes and very well prepared. It is a halal restaurant which is something rare for Thai food in Singapore. All dishes i ordered were delicious and definitely come back again.

Lovely fresh Thai food, we were greeted by a lovely lady who was most helpful explained everything to us & the food was reasonably priced.We went back for a second feed, the lady remembered who we were and the service and food was just as wonderful, would highly recommend. Only wish we had a Thai restaurant back home as yummy

Small little place along river valley road. There was a thai service staff so i presume it is pretty authentic.Ordered tom yum soup, basil chicken, phad thai, thai fish cakes and mixed vegetables. All were good. Bonus: halal food so all muslim friends can come here too.

Visited this halal Thai restaurant located in the River Valley district for dinner. Restaurant setup was great and inviting with friendly and courteous staffs.Generally, the food was good. The spring rolls tasted differently from what was expected, but it was still quite okay. Good food, good service, good ambience - a GREAThai place indeed
