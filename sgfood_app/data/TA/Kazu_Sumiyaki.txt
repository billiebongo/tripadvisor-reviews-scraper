Yakitory style . dont miss

I have been to much fancier restaurants that were no better than this place or indeed slightly worse. The food was great and the specials stunning. Already want to go back
3
Food standard has dropped slightly. The chicken skin is not as crispy and foie gras is overcooked. We had to rush through dinner because there's now 2 seating time slots and people are waiting for our table!

This place is incredible. I have been visiting regularly for a few years and it consistently delivers with quality. The food is very fresh, tasty,!service is good and reasonably priced for Japanese food in Singapore. Would thoroughly recommend for visiting with friends, as couples, for business dinners, or any excuse really! :

Very good sumiyaki. I've been here more than a few times over the years and I've never eaten a bad meal here. That means consistently good food every time. Its great. They change the menu from time to time and often offer seasonal items and at the same time still continue to keep their popular items

~Recommended by Selina 2016Aug & back with family 2016Sep, this is an absolute delight~getting up to the 4th floor, corner the granite looking exterior belies the edge of a very small but charming eatery, with staff that have worked there for ages and still happy with what they are doing ~without a "STRONG" reservation it's impossible to get a table without a long snaking queue outside (you gotta know someone who knows someone)~attentive staff all round with constant recommendations on what goes with what and what else to try just made it an amazing experience with many memorable tasting moments~I started to look at the menu, then apparently the no menu approach was the in thing... sorta just look at what was being delivered over your shoulder to other tables and just order the same~really just be adventurous and let their experience tell you to leave it to them to deliver the 1st time ever to remember... crispy ice cold cabbage with delicious miso sauce my firstraw chicken sushi OMG really delicious my firstmelted rice savory sticks my firstWOW dessert creations a sight to behold~there were just so many many choices that we didn't know at all existed until we let it go to everything they wanted to serve us and let them ask the right questions to discern our palate and let what happens next just beI cannot begin to say just how many YUMz moments that were TOPPED over and over, Kazu their grill chef, their raw sushi chef and their dessert chef outdo themselves many times over :)If you are ever able to get yourself a first seating, grab it! Well worth the wait and although not perfect venue for a romantic visit, once you are inside Kazu the MAGIC happens to YOU

After hearing about this place for so many years from foodie friends, I've finally tried it for myself and was totally blown away.There are menu staples and daily specials that change, but when I was there, these were what I enjoyed: foie gras skewers, akamutsu (sashimi of whole fish - $90), kinmedai (lightly aburi-ed), mochi ice cream, sweet potato, marinated ankimo (monk fish liver), scallops w tobiko n mayo, grilled mochiThe akamutsu is a first for me, WOW what a fish, totally worth the $90.Kinmedai is always a favorite of mine and not commonly found, so glad they served it and I also learnt that its skin should be lightly seared for optimum flavor. Nevermind that it's totally not in season but whatever, the pieces I tasted were excellent!The sweet potato is outstanding. Do order it the minute you sit down as it takes a long time to prepare. I think they do offer to cook it in 2 ways - butter / powdery. Definitely choose the buttery.Foie gras is simply foie gras; foie gras can never be bad in my books.The marinated ankimo was excellent. I've never tasted it prepared like this - mixed with a very umami-rich seaweed gel.The grilled scallops w tobiko and mayo is tasty and rich.Grilled mochi was just that - simply charred plain white mochi pieces. The appeal is in the chewiness and the smokey flavor.Mochi ice cream was so good. Lovely mix of chewy, sweet and creamy. Ask what flavors they have but we tried the strawberry and sweet corn and it was such a lovely combination.Be careful if you're ordering a lot of different things. Our receipt showed some items that we didn't order and the staff did mishear some other items we ordered. But I don't believe it was malicious.Make the reservation (1 week in advance), be prepared to spend a bit, be adventurous with your ordering, listen to the serving staff advice and go

We often come to this place for special celebrations. The chef and his spouse are always nice with us. As I say, simply cooked but so delicious. We order few dishes which we love and let the staff, help us to order the rest. It has been always a good surprise. Kazu has real talent when it comes to cooking and choice of ingredients
5
I went for dinner at Kazu (reservations needed for the 2 sittings of 6.15pm and 8.15pm) and was very very pleased with the overall standard of the food. It is not very often you find a Japanese restaurant serving lamb chops but here they do and cooked to perfection. Also worth trying the grilled foie gras and the beef. Light and black Asahi draught beers go well with the chilled sake which is poured from little glass teapot like servers.Service was very relaxed by pleasant staff with a great attitud

I have been going Kazu for the last 15 years. Over the years I noticed their prices slowly creeping up. Tonite was $280 for 2 pax (inclusive of their cheapest sake at 300ml). What was shocking was the sashimi mori for 2 persons (with only white fish) not very fresh for $50 and the sweet potato at $22 for 2 slices. Maybe that's why for an average izakaya the pricing at $280 for 2 of us is pretty shocking. But u know what, they are still always full and always buzzing! So maybe that's what u have to pay for

Used to dine with my wife at Kazu.
Now going down to dine with my family of four.
Excellent food and service. Handsome Boss from Japan.
Reservation is highly recommended.

Came for dinner. Was seated at bar counter, great service and great food. Had good variety of skewered meat and the bacon wrapped oyster was heavenly. Should recommend early reservation to get a seat.
5
Located in a sleazy building. This place has probably the best yakitori in Singapore. Casual place to have dinner and drinks. Love the pancake balls and chicken wings. Expect to spend SGD100/per person.

We've been regular clients of Kazu Sumiyaki since we arrived in Singapore in 2008. And this is our number one restaurant in Singapore. I don't even know how to describe the experience as it goes way beyond just "food". Everything is perfect and you can tell that the Chef and his wife put so much love and perfection in everything they do: the food, the setting, the cutlery (you get to drink your wine in the finest glasses I have ever touched), the decor, etc. This is a place where you can re-discover asparagus: simply grilled with sea salt crystals, you can eat oursins or simple (but not so simply cooked) yakitori everyone will love. You cannot go to Kazu without talking about the service either: it is no doubt one of the best in Singapore either. You know that the chef works in a family style environment: for 8 years, we have always been attended by the same team, smiling and efficient staff. When we ask them "how come you are still working here after so long?" everyone will answer: it is a good job, it is a family and we love what we do here. We are very well taken care off". Because food is all about balance and harmony, you can imagine why Kazu Sumiyaki reaches this very rare level of perfection. And yes it is busy and noisy - and there is no way you can get a table on a weekend without a reservation. And I am only glad as it confirms quality is always rewarded.Kazu is a gift you want to offer to your best friends in life

Before you can get to the restaurant, you will need to battle your way through throngs of ladies of the night, charmingly, if somewhat persistently calling out for your attention. But I digress. Kazu Sumiyaki is a very small, crowded Yakitori place that serves up a great selection. The standard is very good and some of the dishes, like the oyster and bacon are quite outstanding. All in all, you could do much worse.
4
This place has had consistently great Yakitori and the selection is pretty good, and now they even have Hamburg steaks. However, the place is always crowded so you have to book and food does not come that quickly as it is cooked by batch and type of food, so be prepared to wait 30 mins for certain items

We were there for my daughter's birthday and the yakitori that we ordered did not disappoint at all. I have tasted sea urchin "uni" from various places but the one served here was awesome. The fresh oysters were also fabulous and the Foie Gras was cooked to perfection. The only miss was the beef tendon yakitori which I reckoned was beef brisket. We told the staff that this is our first experience here and she was really helpful in providing guidance for our orders. The service was great with very attentive service staff and the ambience was great for friends and family. Expect about S$80/- to S$100/- per head if you ordered the expensive stuff with Sake thrown in. Reservation is strongly recommended as it was always crowded and the place sits only about 40++ in a tight but still comfortable arrangement. The first seating is from1800 hours and the second one is from 2000 hours. Oh, one more thing, we get to select our own sake glass! One of the best for Yakitori

It's the festive season and we decided to treat ourselves to a extravagant dinner. We had our server to decide most of our dishes, with additional like abalone, oyster and fish sperm. The ingredients are definitely fresh though some dishes were kinda hit and miss. Common dishes like yakitori, pork belly were good but more exquisite items like fish sperm and foie gras were overly-seasoned while the grilled scallop, prawn as well as the uni and wagyu steak was rather mediocre. Over all, decent food, worth a try but be prepared to pay
5
This place is always fully booked and signature skewers are always sold out within a couple of hours of opening. That tells you a lot about the quality of the food. Staff are friendly. It is a small restaurant but it doesn't feel like a Japanese establishment if it's not a bit small
5
This is an interesting Japanese restaurant with limited seating. Its difficult to order from the menu as there's no picture, so we get one of the waitress, Linda, to recommend. Linda introduced us to a wide variety of autentic Japanese food in small servings; food that we normally cannot find in typical japanese restaurants. Overall its a little pricey but it's worth it. Something special and authentic... worth a try
5
The food is always great, worth the booking. always good for a date or a group of couples or a boys' night out. Yakitori and Sake what else can you ask for !
4
Another excellent meal at Kazu. Nicely decorated, although seats are a little bit close to each other so your conversations are always within earshot. Notwithstanding service is professional and attentive but please make advance reservations.
5
Love the food, hard to get table without advance reservation. Staff is usually good, not too friendly which is fine. I recommend ordering the food slowly otherwise they all arrive at once and you can be done in 10mn:)
4
yakitori here is delicious and it is also pricey. try the foie gras, tebayaki, chicken ball, oyters wrapped in bacon. wish they were so sticky about their reservations in 2 seatings.
5
An amazing choice of yakitori and seasonal fresh cuts, the tuna sashimi was amazing, and all the recommendations from the staff were worth trying. This is definitely a place I will go to as soon as I can! Booking is mandatory.
4
Well this has to be one of the top easy eat places in Singapore we were 4people and the service and choice were up there with many 5 star establishments, Just sit back relax and let them look after you.
5
Kazu continues to be my favorite yakitori restaurant in Singapore. A bit pricey (averages out to $80 per head excluding alcohol) but the quality and freshness of the food is excellent. My favorite are the Gingko nuts- available w/ shell on & salted in a bowl, or peeled & roasted on a stick. Other favorite dishes include: garlic fried rice, foie gras, mochi with pork, Kazu pancake balls (okonomiyaki), and wagyu beef w/ enoki
3
Went to eat over here after recommendation from some friends. End up leaving disappointed as the food and especially the service was not up to exception. Some of the food was good, some can be better. The service was k only as then focus on the regular customers. Tried the one at star vista and think there is better.
5
Went for an early dinner at 6pm on a Thursday night with our family of 4 and had to make a reservation in advance as restaurant is usually full. Service was professional and friendly. Decor updated since the last time we were there. Food was excellent - particularly liked the lamb chops, foie gras and fresh sea urchin. Meal was reasonably priced for the excellent quality and quantity. Would certainly make our way back again very soon
5
have been visiting Kazu since 1999. one of the last few restaurant fully managed by the Japanese owner right to the final details. It's not just Yakitori. the fresh cuts are great too.They only open for dinner. Booking is required. the most coveted seat in house are at the bar. they have recently renovated and it adds a touch of modern contemporary touch. Ask for Ms Linda for recommendation of the freshest produces available. good venue for entertainment as Linda can take the cue and decide your menu for you without too much trouble
4
restaurant is located at cuppage plaza, fully occupied on a sat night and long waiting crowd can be seen outside the restaurant. food was served piping hot and promptly. For foie gras lovers, this is a dish you should not miss.
5
Ask for their seasonal special. Had the sweet tomato and corn when I was there. Highly recommended to have the foei gras, chicken meatballs, pink pork and wagyu beef. The goma ice cream and mago yuzu mochi is also highly recommended.
4
The yakitori served at Kazu is a notch above others and my favourites are:
Hokkaido fresh oyster
Foie gras
Chicken skin
Lobster cheese
Squid tentacles
Scallop and prawn wrapped with bacon
Four of us spent $70 each.
5
What can u say about a tiny place in a mall,, Well this has to be one of the top easy eat places in Singapore we were 8 people and the service and choice were up there with many 5 star establishments, Just sit back relax and let them look after you
4
Having turned up twice without a reservation and not being able to get it , it was 3rd time lucky. Food was really good, lots of variety. Favourites included tomato maki, teba, pork shiso , chicken meat wrapped in seaweed and the reckon nikuzume.Now we know why you need to book. Will be back
5
My wife and I have been dining here religiously nearly every Friday for more than 10years. The food menu needs to be extensive enough for is to do this, and it is. The atmosphere is great, just like the bustling joints in Japan, and the experienced service staff helmed by Linda and Wai Ling, makes every visit extremely pleasant. The Omakase hosted by Kazu-San himself is even more special.
4
Just been to this restaurant and have to say it is a hidden gem. Everything we ate was delicious. I highly recommend you try this place. The staff are friendly and helpful and sake is good too. When you enter the centre, don't be put off by the karaoke girls, the whole place is filled with Japanese karaoke bars..
5
while you go tup through the stairs of cuppage plaza you may ask yourselve that the chice was not the best, but just keep on going to the last floor and you will find in my mind one of the best yakitori restaurants in Singapore, as its often the place in the city the best place to eat is not the nicest looking from the outside. very good overall quality
4
The food is SO SO good! But definitely not for the budget conscious! Tucked within Cuppage Shopping Centre, this restaurant is quite hard to find but you'll be surprised how popular it is! We go there a lot as we love the food but was a little disappointed at our last visit when about 25% of what we ordered were sold out... it was a little embarrassing as we had guests. A good experience nonetheless and the food (whatever we could still order), was great as usual
5
Food here is delicious and yummy. Must try their apple pork belly, foie gras, the apple-pork belly, chicken balls & their grilled mushrooms. Staffs are helpful and friendly. Do make reservation before you come if during peak hours but its definitely worth the wait. Overall, I will certainly come again.
4
very good yakitori. pricey tho. dinner for 2 set us back S$200++.
small place, always packed, reservation is a must.
5
Try your best to ignore the dodgy atmosphere of the building, and the other establishments on the fourth floor. Make sure you have a reservation (especially on Friday and Saturday night) and head straight to the restaurant. Kazu only opens for dinner and is usually closed on Mondays.The foie gras and australian wagyu will melt in your mouth. Beef and cheese is a personal favourite and must be eaten hot! Garlic fried rice and chicken wings are also worth trying. Ask about the specials of the day, you might be lucky enough to try a delicacy that was specially flown in.The chef uses a generous amount of flavoured salt on the meat. Drink lots of fluids, the Hakaizen sake is smooth and goes down a little too easy.Despite the humble atmosphere, this meal will not be cheap, so close your eyes and hand over the credit card
4
Three of us went to this place yesterday night. For monday night, the place was quite busy. The gyu tan is a must to order, although is not cheap for one stick, since the meat is imported from australia i heard. The chicken skin is crispy and yummy.But the highlight for us is they gave you the cabbage for free appetizer with miso dipping sauce. It was so sweet And fresh, we ordered the second bowl, and it cost 6 dollar. We spent 125 for 3 person. It's not filling for us but its a nice experience
4
This restaurant is hidden in the cuppage plaze.Be sure to make reservation as the place is packed with people.The waiter was very helpful in making selections even recommending that some order may be a bit too much. Also nice is that they serve smaller portions so you can sample a lotThe taste of the yakitori is very good with many specialities to choose from.We had also very interesting & nice deserts which are certainly worth a try
5
One of our favorite restaurants. The food is great and staff are friendly. Be prepared for a long wait during peak dinner time. Closed on Mondays and first Sunday of the month, last orders at 9.30pm. Recommended:KawaChicken wingsFried squid tentacles Foie grasJapanese sweet potatoes (order immediately upon getting a table as it takes 30mins to prepare)Snowdrop (signature dessert, also order early as it could run out
3
Food very good and service fast, however the ignorance showed by the waitress and the end of the meal lets the place down. First clearing the plates as soon as the last morsel was eaten and asking us if we wanted the bill, without it being requested, then deciding she had to move the partition adjoining our table immediately, in a not so subtle hint for us to leave to create space for the next customers. Obviously not Japanese because the service staff there have learned some manners and to treat customers with respect and don't try and get them out as soon as they can't make any more money from them.
4
This restaurant is highly recommended by a friend. We braved few levels of sleezy pubs before we reached the restaurant. Reservations is a must. They have 2 seatings - 6 to 8pm, 8pm onwards.We had sake, signature garlice rice and quite a few of the yakitori - asparagus in pork, enoki in beef, grilled mushroom, pork and beef balls, chicken skin, prawn/scallop with bacon, quail egg, beef rib etc. They were all yum, grilled to perfection! The service was quite good ... the service crew might recommend more costly stuff to you but it's ok to reject them. It costs us SGD $50 each (abt USD 40) but it was a great dinner ... very satisfying and I'll definitely come back again. BTW, beer and sake selection was good too
5
An amazing little place that serves fantastic yakitori. the tables are a little too closely packed by singapore standards, but it's comfortable. it's a bit on the pricier range, but it's really worth the cost. you do not have to worry about smelling like food when you leave the place as well! some must tries are the foie gras, the apple-pork belly, the beef short rib and the chicken balls! they have occasional specials which the waitress should introduce, but not all are hits. if you have space for desserts, the ice cream is not bad as well. definitely a must go! do remember to make a reservation at least 2 days before. they have 2 seatings each evening, one at 6pm and another at 8pm
4
A great izakaya that specializes in yakitori . The food are grilled to perfection with no need of sauce to mask it's authentic taste. It is a perfect venue for gathering of friends and you will end up just will the evening away . Just order what you fancy from the menu, don't take any of the waitress recommendation as those are usually the " special " and they are over priced. Be prepared to spend average S$100 a head ( group of 4 diners ) that would include quite a substantial amount of shochu , well a bottle actually that concort to nice " lemon sour " cocktail ! Note : seating capacity about 40 pax, so reservation is a must
5
Attentive waiters who overheard my discussion with my guest about what options and very helpfully shared what they had on the menu. Food fresh off the flame, just done to perfection. All the food done with shio instead of sauce so you taste the essence of everything
4
After a bottle of sake...then u start to enjoy the food more..cheers..
5
it's been a while since i actually went there...reminiscing that night...haha, but i still recall that it was superb. hard to get a reservation, not too expensive, and the sticks just pile up. lovely place
4
Foie gras, tiger prawn, quail's egg... skip the dessert though
4
The yakitori range and taste is fantastic!
4
Great little yakitori joint buried in a corner of Cuppage.
3
Often cited as one of the best Sumiyaki Restaurant in Singapore. Am personally not all that crazy about this place. At between S$50-$70/head, I find this place a little too cramp and poorly ventilated. Food was alright. Some interesting choices like pork&apple skewers etc.
4
I went to Kazu on Thursday evening with a friend after hearing so many great reviews and recommendations from my friends. We ordered fresh oysters, bacon-wrapped oysters, scallop and cheese, beef tongue, black pork belly, wagyu steak, chicken and leek and shared a dessert crepe with salted chocolate ice cream. The star of the meal were the fresh oysters which came with chopped spring onions and a seaweed sauce which was refreshing and utterly delicious. The wagyu steak was delicious too, but you can't actually go wrong with good quality beef done medium rare. The dessert was extremely more-ish and we felt very stuffed at the end. When we ordered, the waitress kept saying it isn't enough and we should order more dishes and recommended the rock fish, crab and sashimi which were all really expensive. We took her suggestion for the fresh oysters and wagyu steak which turned out to be $60 just for those 2 dishes. Our total bill was $170.00 for 2, without drinks. Although the food was good, i didn't appreciate the waitress trying to upsell all the time and being slightly pushy
4
What to order- Wagyu Beef on the skewer (S$8.50 per skewer, with a choice of US or Aussie beef - I had US)- Sea Eel (seasonal price - mine cost S$38 but was very good)- Whole squid (S$18 - it was gigantic)- minced garlic chicken / garlic pork- ask for their seasonal specialWhat else to do- Make a reservation - the place is small and gets packed- be prepared to spend cos it ain't that chea
4
I'm a regular customer of this restaurant.Being here for more than ten times this year.Very Cosy place for party,gathering..etcStaff are quite friendly n helpful.Booking in advance is a MUST as it can be very crowded even on weekdays!! They are closed on every Mon n they only open at 6pm!!U must try their starter dish which is cold cabbage,Miso paste provided ( with slices of lemon)Squeeze the lemon juice on the miso.The cold cabbage is very crispy.Then u can order the main dishes like Grilled scallop on cheese,chicken wing/chicken meatball,Shitake mushroom w meat,Bacon w Aparagus/Avocado,Black pig cheek,foie Gras,garlic fried rice,baked sweet potato n lastly their authentic green tea ice cream.All their products are air flown from Japan!

I have been coming to this restaurant for about 5 years now but it has really dropped in quality and increased its prices. Staff are friendly, but insincere and motivated to upsell. This used to be one of my favorite spots, regrettably I will not be returning anytime soon.Expect to spend an average check of SGD 100 per head (with out alcohol) for a below average meal
