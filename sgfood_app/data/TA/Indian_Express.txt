Went with business lunch. Good atmosphere with good quality food. Service was also good. Price is reasonable.

This one is mid range Indian restaurant.
Got most popular dishes in sizzling style
That’s speciality. Overall food is good. Happy hour options available
5
They have a limited menu but amazing food. Every dish is very amazing and tasty. The cook is very good
2
I went with my wife, and we thought we will give it a try.
we ordered some basic vegetarian curries, and the taste was useless. Service was slow too.

Pros:
Food is good.
Ambiance is nice
Staff is friendly.
Cons:
Serving time is very late
Quantities for some dishes were less

I had a percect Indian dinner with my boyfriend last summer. The sauces was so good that I asked the server to write the sauce's name down so that I could find a restaurant as perfect as Indian Express in Seoul myself. Unfortunately, I haven't found one yet. I hope I visit Indian Express one more time in my life
2
We went as a family, the food taste was inconsistent (the tikka and gravy tasted good while the pulao was terrible). They have limited varieties and prices are on the mid-high ranges. The service was ok. The dining ambience was good but i found the wash area and restroom unusable and unhygienic(who would expect such from a restaurant that looks decent from the outside). It is not crowded mostly so you could easily find a place here. I would have considered giving a 3 star if at-least the wash are was clean. Not a 'go to' restaurant atleast for u

I dined at Indian Express, Race Course Road last night with my family. Honestly, I was contemplating whether to go in or look for some other place down the road. But at last decided to go in and dine. Food was so amazing, especially Tandoori Platter and Butter Chicken. Not much of Service staff around but very empathetic and professionally trained. Loved it.................You made our evening folks ,Good Bless you all and Keep doing good work.RegardsJimmy Masia

What a fantastic really tasty meal. All staff so friendly and didn't mind chatting to my wife and myself. I asked if they used a proper tandoor oven and with that they asked me if i wanted to come and have a look. Recommendations were excellent on our choices and it was if he knew what heat level I wanted in my curry. So attentive and nothing too much trouble. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Singapore who wants an authentic Indian meal

This restaurant is located in little India Singapore.... We went to this hotel only bcoz other restaurants were full or closing down... thr was no one in restaurant so I told my family not to go here... But my dad insisted as it was open nd ready to serve food.. we ordered lime soda, prawns, paneer,roti nd some starters... Well the lime soda tasted like medicine as they made it from some artificial liquid... The prawns were undercooked nd were very chewy...We ordered spicy prawns but they turned out to be little sweet.. the paneer was ok.. the chutney with the starters was very sour.... Nd to top it all they don't serve water .... U can have only​ mineral water which they charge separately.... So pls don't waste ur money here instead go to some other place...Note: if u really want to eat good Indian food go to Delhi restaurant on the same street..
5
We randomly stumbled on this place and loved the food. Wines were reasonably priced and the food was bursting with great flavour. Loved it!
4
Very good connected place in the middle of many Indian cuisine options. One can find many good options over here and you can ask for chef special to get better option
5
It was good experience going to the Indian express and went couple of time, they served very good and bear is also cheap and honest servents
4
Delicious food so tasty. The supervisor is obliged us even though we forget to reserve. The service is bit slow due to under staff. Never the less, attitude of the staff is very good. With Groupon vouchers its more than value for money. Must try.
4
We had purchased 2 coupons from Groupon which entitled us to have food worth 30 SGD at 15 SGD. The food at Indian express was good. Average veg meal for 2 adults and 1 child was around 60 SGD (a soup, 1 veggie,1 dal, few rotis, rice and something to drink). The restaurant is easily accessible from Little India MRT
4
We were looking for a place that also sold beer, not so many places in little india have brew. This place advertised a beer special price, so why not. I was quite pleased all around. Food was tasty, though less spicy than I normally get and the beers were ice cold. Atmosphere is modern and you can see into the kitchen. I would certainly come back here again, recommended.
2
I'm a huge fan of Indian food, but even I can't stomach Indian Express. I ordered the Chicken Biriyani and Masala Chicken and neither tasted very good. The Chicken Biriyani was at least edible. The Chicken Masala is probably the worst tasting Indian dish that I have ever tried. It was bitter and almost tasted burnt. I'm quite disappointed that I wasted my money
3
We were on our way to little India and had booked this Groupon voucher for Indian Express.. Though e had made the reservation, as suggested on the Voucher, but still had to wait before being seated. There were only 2 Staff in the restaurants and they did all the work from serving to clearing the tables to serving alcohol.. Service was hence very snail paced. They only have one Chef and arriving of food takes times.We ordered a 3 course meal and had to wait for atleast 10-15 minutes for each course to arrive. The food was not up to my taste as it differed in great deal from what was written on the menu. When I told this to the server, that this food differs, he gave me some lame reasons. Though my husband liked the food he had ordered.Mixed reviews!.. I would not go here if I dont have a discount voucher to be redeemed.P.s- Food was so heavy with Cream and butter that it upset my stomach for the next day..
5
We had dinner in this Restaurant tonight, actually, because the beer was really cheap ;) (3,90)We had dinner in another restaurant in this road before, where we had almost the same dishes. They were comparable in taste and price but i think the staff in the indian express was nicer. We even got a dessert for free! So i would really recommend this place! Even if you don't see a lot of guests in there
5
Sadly, this place has closed down but it was one of my favorite places to go to. Every dish I have eaten at this restaurant for 3 years as being stunning. The briyani when cooked fresh is so so good and meat is really tender. Dishes to die for are the mutton roganjosh and the full platter. The mutton roganjosh comes with a spicy curry and tender mutton. The full platter is a mix of tandoori chicken, fish, sheekh kebab and lamb shank. The serving size for any dish is HUGE. Just order one rice and even two people would not be able to finish it. The naans are big in size as well. Staff are really friendly and pricing wise it's pretty cheap compared to the quality and serving size of the food you get. This was truly my favorite indian restaurant that I have eaten in Singapore
5
good food, black dal available, which you wont find in other restaurant located near by.nice ambiance,nice people,
5
Naans are brilliant, curries are sensational, service is acceptable and prices are crazy. All up a great visit on a loaded wallet.
1
Waste of my money !! Never will step into this place !! Horrible .. Feel like vomiting when I think of it .. Don't ever go there for Biriyani .. May be other dishes are good. I hate this place
4
Food Taste is good but less Vegetarian options available. They provide only bottle drinking water, which they charge. Less specious and average service.
4
Liked the food. Liked the ambience. Near to little India Mrt.
Price is ok. But lunch time closes by 3 PM so be the before 3 PM if u r planning to have lunch.
5
Tasty North Indian Food with good service and very friendly.
Walking distance from Little India or Farrer Park MRT.
4
Great hospitality, great deals on drinks. The Lucknavi cuisine did not disappoint and while its not exactly Lucknow it comes close. Awadhi style goat biryani is specially recommended. Have come here with groups of 2 and 4 and 6. We always begin with a feast on an assortment of fine kebabs, both vegetarian and meat varieties available, portions generous. And the manager and host Gurpal Singh is always attentive and helpful. The only small minuses are the small size of the place and poor acoustics at times. Love bringing friends here
3
Good location, good ambience, the service was ok, I totally understand but the food was kinda average. I have tried many indian cuisine and I am expecting solid indian authentic where I can feel and enjoy like I had back in India, and I missing it. I hope my next visit, will be better
4
The food here is absolutely incredible. Good portion sizes, great value and friendly staff! I will certainly be returning and strongly recommend others to try it also. Extremely fresh and tasted fantastic. But try and visit the toilet before or after, as the toilets here are disgusting and in need of sorting out

Visited the restaurant yesterday with family and friends. Ordered few items like Garlic naan, fish tikka, Tandori Platter, biryani etc. None of the items except the garlic naan was ok, they were all below average. Even you get better food in food court where you have to spend only 5-6$. How are they surviving in Race Course Roard neighbouring to so valued restaurants. The prices in the catalogue are as expensive as very standard reatuarants.I feel they don't have good chef at all

I had Indian Express meals from Marina Bay Sands food Center on 12th Dec evening. I was surprised at the poor food quality and taste. It cost nearly 10 SGD/meal. The rice was orange/yellow colored and bland. Not recommended.
5
It was a great experience with indian express , this was my first visit. Everything was perfect and staff were very friendly and food was very tasty specialy tandoori chicken in hot pan with mint sauce ....good Job .....keep it up .
5
already the second time i've staied in this Restaurant and again, I am fully satisfied with the Quality of the Food, the mood, and the perfect Service.
For sure I will have another stop when i come again to singapore. Thanks!

Very average restaurant, I would not recommend it nor going back - there are many better places around.
5
you would find lots of Indian restaurants in little India, but we preffered visiting this one the most. It serves excellent Indian food with great hospitality. Don't forget to try the Dal makhni....
1
I use to frequent the restaurant for a few years now. It use to be a decent eatery with friendly and fast service and good food. However, my visit with friends yesterday was terribly marred by the poor service and the attitude of the staffs. It started fine with a staff taking our drinks orders immediately. Then, everything went downhill. We waited for 20 mins with nothing being served not even our drinks or the usual appetiser (Papad). The staffs were just lazing around near the kitchen or on the phones most of the time during service. It was a small restaurant and there were only few tables were filled. One finally came to our table for the entree order after waiting for such a long time but quickly left to answer a call without a proper courtesy. He was on the phone for 10 mins. I was totally annoyed and we just cancelled our orders and walked off immediately. Don't waste your time coming here as there's a lot of place with better food and service nearby. I would certainly not recommend this restaurant to anyone

Yesterday visited to this small casual restaurant situated near little India Mrt with few friends , food and service was decent through they were busy , the main focal point was excellent quality mutton Rogan josh and the very crispy Naan I enjoyed to eat that :
1
We ordered Chef Special Kundan Kaliya (lamb) , Kadhai Paneer , Kulfi and Pani PuriOverall food quality is very poor.Chef Special Kundan Kaliya is the worst - we returned our dish as we thought its rotten and chef confirmed its not well cooked. They served us again but nothing changed- basically poor quality Lamb.Pani Poori was bad .Veg food very average,Only silver lining was Veg Pulao which tasted good.Overall many other better options available in singapore for Indian food - so avoid.30$/P
4
On our last day in Singapore we ate close to our hotel.Under Orchard MRT station we found food hall.We decided to eat Indian.We watched from our table as the chef made our food.It was good to see the meals being made all fresh.The Nans were excellent , light fluffy and hot.The tandoor chicken was excellent so were the Kababs.The Samosas , salad & mint chutney were also good
5
The restaurant was very close to Little India MRT and Tekka center. The food was really tasty and hot and the person who served it was serving with a smile. We tried Dal Tadka and Kadhai Paneer and both dishes were really very tasty. The price was ok not very expensive. Overall a very nice Indian restaurant with good food and nice service
5
Truly enjoyed the Lucknavi experience. Amazing food and very good staff. Definitely visiting it again. Specially recommend 'Ulte tave ka parantha'.
4
Rather small restaurant with a intimate and homely atmosphere
Very refined and subtle Northern Indian cuisine where flavors complement each other.
Suggestions from restaurant manager are always well proposed.
Authenticity is the driver behind offering.
Very reasonable prices
5
Clean, polite and great tasting food! Speaking as someone who eats a lot of Indian food, I think you cannot go wrong.

we had some misgivings about this establishment, having read some negative reviews about the staff attitude and service. were we "lucky" that we do experience much negativity other than the fact that the service was slow.there are,however, many positives at indian express.it is a small thirty or so seater restaurant but cosy with some sort of elementary decor and decent lighting.we found the staff to be attentive, polite and helpful. the food was very good when it did arrive. the menu folder is well laid out with graphics and sufficient (though not extensive) range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices. the vegetarian choice includes the common dhall, vegetable done in several ways and palak paneer, which was exceptionally good.the palak was not unduly coloured up and had good body.taste wise all the dishes were very good, highlighting the indian spices subtly blended to bring out the full aromas.their non vegetarian specialities are kebabs.the fish tikka was brilliant, served on a bed of fresh vegetables. it was moist yet well done without being burnt.the dessert choice is rather limited to icecream, kulfi and gulab jamun.the kulfi , while being nicely flavoured was very small and increasing the quantity should be considered.the restaurant also has takeaway and catering services.mr gurpal singh the manager is extremely hardworking, lending his hand in whichever department needed it - be it the kebab section or the tandoor section. he explained that the reason for the slow service is that good indian food is prepared fresh; hence the delay.i would say that in addition to mr gurpal's reasoning it is the limited staff the restaurant is operating with that is a possible cause of delays. i can understand that situation with the high cost of hiring and the rental the management has to optimise to stay afloat.muti tasking by the staff is also essential to ease some of the hardships.i am ok with slow service as long as it is well handled and it sure was in our case and your wait is compensated with reasonably priced good food. it is so at the indian express. to ease the pain of the longer wait bar service at very fair rates is available. enjoy

We went there to have Indian Food. The ambience was quite ordinary but that was just the beginning. The soup was cold and the food was disappointing. To top it all, the staff were absolutely indifferent to guests having food and replied rudely. One of them called Gopal Singh was the worst of all and claimed to be owner. We just walked out of the restaurant without finishing our mea
4
Very good North Indian food. The manager is very friendly and his recommendations are always correct! This has been my 5th visit in less than a year and never disappointed. The food menu is more suited for non-vegetarian although they have a few vegetarian main courses

This was a return visit to a restaurant I liked initially. Walked in with wife last night for dinner. And ordered exactly the same order as last time - grill mix platter, butter chicken and naan, gulaab jamun (costing about 40sgd++ for 2 peopleI was disappointed that though the staff remains friendly as usual - the quality of food has declined considerably over last 3-4 months.The lamb kebab in the platter was quite tough and there was no fish in it this time. The rest of the platter was just about average. The "chutney" has been considerably diluted down.The butter chicken remains as good as my previous visit. The naan was tough in consistency and i suspected it was cooked probably a few hours ago.Thankfully, the gulab jamun was really nice. The whiskey that i ordered was priced 30 sgd++ for a double which felt a bit too pricy considering this isn't exactly a fine dine restaurant.Bottom line- stick to butter chicken. Ask if naan is freshly baked. And don't order alcohol. The are much better places to splurge on liquor and feel good about

Our friends are regulars at this restaurant and they wanted to know what I thought being half Punjabi and raised on foods from Northern India. As I said at the end of the meal, my Punjabi father would have been singing the praises of this place as the food was so fresh and flavoursome - no oily take away food here! Service was excellent - staff have a calm, quiet and non intrusive manner and effectively provide recommendations if required. The chicken dishes were packed with flavour and were not taken over by chillis - a good sign of an effective, non Westernised Indian restaurant. My childhood favourite was baingan (smoked aubergine) and I make it regularly at home so when I saw it on the menu I, of course, had to give it a go. My only niggle was that the baingan at this restaurant was not smoky enough and needed to be left under the grill for a little longer. Every other dish shone and I would recommend going here if you want authentic food from Northern India. The price tag was fine also - $12 Singapore dollars for a main meal is not bad. We had lots of food left at the end of the meal so had it put in a doggy bag for the morning after
4
We spent some time studying the menu, and had decided. However, we asked the waiter if he agreed with our choices. He didn't, and picked out other dishes for us. The dishes he chose for us were fantastic, we were really pleased with the quality of the food. Also he suggested we only ordered rice at the end if we really needed it - we didn't. We went at about 8.30 on a Saturday night and it was pretty quiet. It was a lot busier by the time we left so I would suggest going a little later on.
4
Good find in the Indian restaurant strip in LITTLE INDIA, Race Course road.It's a smallish place as most are here but the food is solid - maybe a trite bland for hard core Indian palates - but I am not so it hit the spot. It's all reasonably priced and service is efficient. The highlight is the Air flown Paneer - Indian cottage cheese - which if you are a fan, you miss in Singapore.All in all a good pick if you crave North Indian
4
Had some Indian cuising here and food was above average. Their main pulling factor is cometetive prices. Worth a visit.

I went with my family to this restaurant as we'd heard a lot about it. Since it was from the same folks of The Song of India, the expectations were of high quality food.Our experience was a bit mixed.We went in primarily for the kababs. The Chicken Tikka was pretty standard and not really special. We'd also ordered the Gaulati Kababs. These obviously took a while to show up but were not really as satisfying as we've had at Yantra on a good day.The surprise however was the Ulta Tawa Paratha. We were quite taken in by the name and decided to order one. It was absolutely delicious. Yes, it is a bit heavy on the calories but completely worth it. We ended up ordering 3 more as they were just amazing.The service was prompt an very professional. And the decor is typical of a Little India area restaurant. Absolutely nothing to write home about. Its one of those places you'd pop in for a quick bite and then not linge
5
We were welcomed into the restaurant by the staff and ushered into a cozy cornerThe spiced lamb rack I ordered came in sizzling (a surprise) and was perfectly done.So was the chicken butter masala and cheese naan.The chicken tikka was nice as well. Gurpal, Rohit and other staff were very welcoming.Overall a great experience.

I was roaming around Little India and we thought of having some authentic Indian food.. kind of feeling homesick :-) ..It was just by chance that we entered this restaurant and it was a great discovery ! Of my two weeks stay in Singapore, where I had mix of Indian, Chinese, Continental and other different cuisine food, the best lunch I had was at this restaurant. We ordered classical Yellow Dal and a Paneer Gravy with Breads and the taste of the food was awesome ! On top of it the people serving there were from North India and it was a pleasure to catch up with them in Hindi ! whenever I go back to Singapore, I am surely going back to this place :-
4
This small branch in Ion on Orchard is a regular haunt now, they do excellent Chicken Tikka and a very nice Naan bread in the tandoor. I always top it up with some dhal and overall its good quality and reasonable price. If you want a change from the many other Chinese centered food stalls this is worth the effor
5
We went to this resturant because of Galawati kebab is being offered in menu, which is not aviable in any of the resturant in singapore, but it was a let down. The galawati kebab was more of seek kabab. but the other food we ordered was exceptionally good and match the indian taste buds and suitable for any westerners.the over all food quality is excellent, ingredients are fresh. the staff is courteous and listen to customer and offer advise.Dishes are moderately priced with mains around12 to 13 and vegetarian dishes around 8 to 10. they do not add service charge on bill so leaving a tip will be a good idea.This is a part of the song of India chain and does live upto expectations. The menu is nice and offers good choices.i will sure like to go back for other food than for galawati kabab
4
This is a part of the song of India chain and does live upto expectations. Dishes are moderately priced with mains around12 to 13 and vegetarian dishes around 8 to 10. Decor is comparable to other restaurants in race course road. Service is a lil slow. You can expect to find kebabs which are not so common in indian restaurants . The menu is nice and offers good choices. I found the salt levels a tad too high but overall a good dining experience
4
Some of my friends recommeded this place, we had very decent called lucknavi food with my collegues, lamb shank was good , also the naans with spicy sauce , as i am an indian i love the chatpata food lover of meats, that is taste i can campare with with it. over all a decent dinner we had . i can recommend to visit this with not too much expectation for a decent meal at decent price

Having read a few good reviews about the place, hubby and I decided to check it out last weekend. Only 2 tables were occupied so it definitely wasn't crowded and I can see why now. We were served water but hubby discovered lipstick marks on his glass which we asked to change. I was ready to head out for that alone but we decided to stick around seeing how we wanted to try the Lucknowi cuisine. Big mistake!!Hardly any popular items from Lucknow, like Kakori kebabs or Patili ke kebabs. Gilawat kebabs were a let down. Ulta Tawa Paratha not available, reason being the guy who prepares it was off, on a weekend of all days when they might see a few people about. We had the murgh shorba, so so, Gilawat Kebab as said earlier were a let down, chicken tikka which thankfully was the only good dish we had, Tawa Ghosht quantity good, could have been better, and garlic nan. I should have stuck to my earlier thought and walked out to enjoy the usual restos closeby which we usually go to. Never again..

Had been wanting to eat here for a long time as had read the review in a local paper which said good things about it and the menu looked interesting. Went during the Diwali weekend and found it very crowded with poor service because there weren't enough service staff. In fact a few people walked out after waiting for more than 10 minutes without anyone attending to them. The manager was overworked - cleaning tables, handling the cash as also baking nans at the tandoor. Their signature dish, Gilawati Kebab was not availaible. The other items we ordered - a mutton dish, a chicken curry dish and the breads were not too bad. Tandoori chicken was a disappointment - it was too bland and too stiff
