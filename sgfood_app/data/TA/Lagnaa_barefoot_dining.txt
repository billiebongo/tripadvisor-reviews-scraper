We were walking around and stopped in for a beer. Couple in our group had coffee but my reason to visit was a cold beer. We had a nice conversation with the owner and wish we could have had lunch. The food looked great.
5
The service is so great, everyone is very welcoming. The food is also soooo delicious! I also love the concept of choosing your spice level (I can’t get pass a level 5 though! Haha) I recommend to everyone to come here :)
5
The food is seriously good and the owners are seriously fun, you’ll enjoy your evening no doubt. Me and the wifey have even booked in for a cooking class. Can’t reccomend this establishment high enough.

Went their with friends for dinner. Staff will ask you the spicy level for dishes. They have high spicy level as well.
But some of the dishes you can find raw spiciness.

The prices are outrageous. For that reason, this gets my rating as “tourist trap”.Everything is al la carte. For lunch, I had one order of chicken tikka masala $17 sdg. It had of sauce with 5 small nuggets of chicken. One order vegetable Koorma $12 sdg, (a few veggie in a green sauce), basmati rice $3, 2 orders of nan bread $3 each (only one piece comes per order) a lime can soda $6 sdg, and a ice masala tea $8 sdg. So almost $60. Wow! Good flavor to the food, but certainly not “special”. Nothing special about location or view. Servers here are good, but have been good everywhere we have eaten. No reason to pay exorbitant prices here.

We were invited here as our first dining-out experience since moving to Singapore. The people we were with were regulars, so much so that one of them even has her photo on the menu! Food was delicious. Unfortunately I'm not really a fan of Indian cuisine (I prefer Mediterranean flavours) but I ordered a prawn tikka with a side of raita and steamed rice. I thoroughly enjoyed it, particularly the spice level which I'm usually quite fussy about because I'm a weakling when it comes to spice! But it was spicey enough not to be bland and unadventurous, but not spicey enough to blow my (pathetic) socks off.Husband had an Indian chicken curry level 4 spice (which is apparently akin to a British vindaloo), which he ate in full without any drink or raita dip, which means he was awarded a level 4 wooden peg which he doodled his name on and clipped up on the wall of HUNDREDS of other pegs (levels 1-10) belonging to other people's accomplishments. FYI attempting spice level 6 and above is by invitation of the restaurant only as these levels can only be attempted if you have completed levels 4 and 5 without issue. I believe I heard that only 1 person has ever completed level 10! He was a chap from Nepal who did so many years ago.Staff were just unbelievably pleasant. Felt like we were family.The entire exterior of the restaurant (not sure about the inside) is covered in beautiful and sentimental written messages from customers from all around the world, spanning hundreds of countries and decades of time. Shame I didn't take a picture but I was too busy enjoying the evening.Would return and WILL return next week actually

We found this place on a whim, down a side street off the main road and ventured in given the busy shopfront and trip advisor posters (consecutive winner since 2013). Met with such friendly staff happy to offer their recommendations (knock out beer was ). Their curries come with ratings 1-10, anything above 3 if you can manage the dish on your own serves you a peg on the wall (only up to 6 and once you're on the wall you can go back on full moon and take on 7-10). I had the chicken curry L2 and it was possibly the best curry I've ever had, the naan was delish and not greasy at all, definitely recommend the yoghurt dish to tame the curry or (not) if you're game. A must visit in little Indi

A great little restaurant in a small side street of Serangoon Road. At first glance, it may not look particularly special, but the selection on the menu is good and the quality of the food is simply amazing. If you like your meals spicy (to the point of numb tongue and lips), then this is the place for you!

I was entertaining a colleague visiting Singapore, who wanted to walk through Little India and grab dinner. Since our go-to Indian places are in other neighborhoods, I consulted Lonely Planet for some suggestions and off we went. The staff is friendly, but overall, I was disappointed by the small portions/high prices, and the overall food quality. I eat Indian food 1-2x a week in Singapore, and this was different/not as good. The Paneer in the Paneer Palak was tiny-marshmallow sized rather than Feta cube; the sauce was green and soupy, not rich and creamy. Butter chicken was breasts, which was a nice change), but there wasn't much of it. Lassis are all ~$8, which also seemed expensive. Our meal for 2 was $110, and honestly, I left hungry. They do have sampling menus, which are perhaps a better value, it just didn't offer the food we wanted. The staff was very friendly, and the restaurant full of tourists
5
Food was really good, I was surprise to learn that the chef is making its own paneer.The spice challenge is fun, if you have a friend or two who are brave (fool?) enough to try you will definitely have a fun time. Finally, the staff is very welcoming (way above Singapore standards)
5
Great menu choices. I was happy with the cheapest one: 25 dollars and you get fish, chicken, saffron rice, naan and paneer.
3
Nice ambiance and nice service. You can choose to seat upstairs in an air corn room. If you sat on a the first floor, you might see a mouse running around like us.
3
Visited the restaurant as a group of 5 as mystery shoppers for our school module. An eye-opening experience for us as we had mix impressions afterward. Food was great and somewhat worth the price. Our total bill came up to $99 for 4 pieces of garlic naan, 1 variety size Palek Paneer, Koli Curry Leaf and 1 quantity size butter chicken, 1 basmati rice and 1 jug of mango juice. We went during non-peak periods, love the ambiance on the top floor, it's perfect to just hang out. Lady mistook our bill but was friendly and amended the mistake. The service staff could smile more but he was knowledgeable about the food when we enquired. We enjoyed the experience and love the mango juice and butter chicken, but it would be a once in a lifetime visit for all of us
3
We had a pleasant meal here, eating a modest amount of food on a family meal out. But $135! The following day we ate a very similar amount of food in a far more salubrious part of town at a Japanese restaurant for $40!The curries were good, but small portions. Rice and naan were average at best. Living off its Tripadvisor rating and amenable staff.
4
Four of us,plus our baby granddaughter ventured into little India in search of the Lagnaa. Cold beers greeted us as we arrived in the very busy and tightly packed lane that housed many many restaurants. This one only stood out because it was rated on TripAdvisor. Little India, as a whole, is a shock to the system after the cleanliness and order of mainstream Singapore. Chaos rules baby! The food was Okay, not much different to the Indian across the road at home, although with a lot more going on. The whole eating in a noisy alley in a rough looking neighbourhood has its appeal somewhere I guess, but seems wildly out of place in the meticulous Singapore. Probably three star
5
Went today for a late lunch and wow! We were blown away with the flavors, quality of food and cozy family run friendly service. They gave us a good download of the menu and we chose butter paneer (vegetarian), butter chicken and fish curry. We got burry naan and yogurt rice with them and by far the best Indian I have had. Kulfis were amazing. Loved the conversation with the owners and really glad we went. Think this is must go spot during visit in Singapore.
4
Good was tasty, I had a 0 level curry and chicken tikka while other half went all out in a level 6. Many other posters have complained about the price but the curry was clearly freshly made and good quality.The only thing to be aware of is (as with many places in Singapore) wine prices are $60+ per bottle.
5
We went there on the first evening in Singapore and came back again! The service is great and the people are very helpful in helping you to choose you food or the rice that best fits with it. Today, we sat and spoke to the owners who are extremely friendly and kind! The little restaurant they have created might not look that posh but the food is so great that you forget anything surrounding you! It really is a place to eat at and envoy a curry !! Don’t miss the footprints on the floor, they’ll lead you right to it!! Go there and if you like it, recommend it as places like these should last forever and be enjoyed by many!
5
Nice and tasty Indian food. Some people will say it is small place and awkward due to limited space but I enjoyed it. Nice waitress and the freshly cooked meal was just yummie. We had Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala and both were incredible tender and tasteful
1
I don’t normally write reviews online but I feel a need to share (warn others about) my experience eating here. The price to food quality and quantity ratio is ridiculous. I’m a local Singaporean and I’ve eaten at a lot of Indian restaurants not just in the Little India are but also all over Singapore. I’ve had much better food for a lot less. Our meal (2pax) here cost upwards of $60 and all we had was a Dahl, butter paneer, one lassi, 2 naan, and one skewer that consists mainly of vegetables and one cube of paneer. We were so disgusted by the experience that me and my husband went two doors down to New Madras and ordered their sets for less than $10 each. This place targets tourists who do not have much experience with Indian food, who mainly want to drink and dabble in the gimmicky “hot chilli factor”. You can do much better at almost any other restaurants in the area: Gokul, New Madras, Komala, Delhi, Anjappar, etc. Most of these other places have earned our Long term support for years. Tip for tourists: peep into the restaurants at lunch or dinner time. If they’re packed with locals, you know it’s gotta be good. Suffice to say, I’ll never return here

I love Lagnaa for , Good choices of Indian food, Customisable spice level, Excellent friendly service. Great people..!! And u will be invited for fun events, meet new friends. Simply one of the best indian food in country...!!
5
Lovely restaurant. The staff are delightful and full of energy.
My mate and I went for some chili challenges and somehow made it to being offered a tequila shot infused with a ghost chili. The food is top notch.
Very funny night had by all.
5
Authentically cooked food and traditional floor seated dining experience. Great hospitality and service. If you like your Curry hot, this is the place in Singapore!!!
5
Excellent Indian food made authentically rather than with cheap ingredients & a quick process. Gluten free awareness was great.
Options for those who like a spicy challenge also!
5
Absolutely loved this authentic Indian dining experience. The owners went above and beyond with recommendations and explaining the dishes. The food was over the top. We chose to sit upstairs in the floor for our meal. Had our two teenagers with us. The owner came to sit with us a while after we were done. It is evident that he loves what he does. I highly recommend this place. If we would have had more time in Singapore, we would have returned as well have tried their cooking class. The food was very flavorful. Almost everything could be made gluten free which they are extremely knowledgeable about.
2
Other than very good, friendly service- very little is good here. Food was very average and value for money terribl
5
I recommend Lagnaa not only for the good indian food but also for the nice conversations around the table with its highly skilled staff, always willing to teach something about Indian food, cooking techniques... great people!They organize fun events during the month where you can meet new friends while tasting new dishes and challeng your foodie skills. Highly recommended

We were 4 walking through little India. One person with the Lonely Planet in her hand. We passed a dozen interesting and cheap Indian restaurants, but thought we give this one a try. When arriving, it was already rather busy with other tourists. We got a table on the side walk, far from ideal. Anyway, the food was decent - nothing outstanding or remarkable in my view (but than tastes differ). But the prices were rather high for what it was. I thus learned my lesson and will not follow anymore just the "Lonely Planet" guidebook. Surely the owners are friendly. But each LP place starts to look more like the last one (in the same or a different country). In the future I will again venture off, try out places which appeal to me and not just follow in the footsteps of a million other travellers. Yes, occasionally you might not be positively surprised, but most of the time it will be a unique experience, which surely it was not in this restaurant
4
No one told me they have a spicy food challenge! If you eat all of your curry at a level 5 or over you get to have a clip with your name on it next to the spice rating. There has only ever been one guy to do a level 9 in twelve years. A Nepali guy. Forget it if you think you can walk in off the street and order a level nine. The owner won't serve it to you, you have to start at 6 and work your way up from there. They only do a level 9 challenge maybe three times a year. If you make it to 8 they take your info and will mail you your own invitation to the challenger. The reigning champ said he'd fly back and beat anyone if they ever caught him at level 9. Fun! The owner is so nice and talked with me for a long time. Good food too
4
Service is great and it has a very welcoming atmosphere. You almost feel like you are in the chefs home. I've even seen him sit down with a table and talk about the food for over 30 mins! They also offer cooking classes on Saturdays and if you're the first to sign up you can choose the dish! This is a must if you're coming to Little India
3
The food is somewhat above average but way too expensive for the choices available.
Service was not as great for if you were to go in a big group.
However, they do have an unique choice of spiciness, if you are in to it.

2 Dutch friends and a Singaporean (I) were looking for a dinner place after exploring Little India and we happened to stumble upon this place. It looks cozy with nice atmosphere. But please do NOT be deceived by its looks. The Chef / or Owner is very keen to push you to try their over-priced set meal ( I think its SGD$25/$48 per person and above, EXcluding 10% service charge) . We were not very hungry so decided to go for ala-carte. This has probably pissed them off as they earned less $$? While we were ordering, we are unsure of the portion and wanted to make sure we had ordered enough for us, so we innocently asked "How many Naans are there in 1 portion?" We did not realise an innocent question from a clueless customer would lead to mockery and hostile reaction from the Chef/Owner. He started laughing at us. And asking "Where are you from?", "Haven't you hear about us? " Have you ever ate in a such a well-known Indian restaurant like us?" “When you order food in the World, don’t all the food comes in 1 piece ?” " all Naans in the whole world comes in only 1 piece "They are a total disgrace to Singapore Tourism Industry. If you enjoy being ripped off like a tourist, or enjoy being mocked at after paying a premium price, then please go and try this Barefoot dining experience.We were so appalled by their behavour that we left immediately after paying SGD$45 (EUR 28) for 3 drinks (1 soda water, 2 vodka lime) and a portion of Papadum. We can't say much for the food though except that the Papadum was not cripsy and fresh at all. It is soft, like it had been fried and left for long time in the high humidity of Singapore, turning soggy. So I guess if an Indian Restaurant who can’t even get a basic Papadum right, one should not even have any high expectations on other dishes.Oh and on the contrary, their Papadum portion comes in 3 or 4 pieces, definitely not 1 piece.There are many other restaurants in Little India which costs much less than them, while giving you a more authentic Little India experience and better service. Example: Banana Leaf, New Woodlands, Komalas and many more
5
I enjoyed a lovely anniversary dinner with my partner at Lagnaa in Little India. We chose the "barefoot dining" venue upstairs at the restaurant and shared a selection of three spicy curries with naan and rice. Since it was our anniversary, Shanti @ Lagnaa even prepared a special "Say it Softly" Naan which included a special message which was a pleasant touch to the evening. Recommend this restaurant for Singapore residents and tourists alike
2
This may have been the gem in 2013 when the Washington Post wrote about it but I don't see it living up to all that glory. The food is still ok but it's not that remarkable. The portions are TINY and it's extremely overpriced. The service was slow, inattentive and even hostile. Would not recommend to anyone and will not be coming back.
5
Really good Indian food and excellente service. Come early (by 7pm all tables were taken). Menu card really have a lot. If you are 2 or more, they have set menus. I had chicken tikka marsala, raita, Rice and garlic naan. The White Wine is also very good. The food come with your choice og chili level from 1 to 10. Do go here, if you Like Indian food. I will for sure come back.

To be very clear: the food here is delicious. We had a variety of dishes and everything was excellent.The staff were extremely friendly, the place was clean and sitting upstairs on the floor with no shoes feels authentic.Why -1 star?It is pricey. It is more expensive than anything around AND the portions are small. They do offer two “sizes” but we ordered 3 curries, Saag aloo, Dahl, 2 portions rice, one naan and one roti for two people, and it was modest. Plus two tiny glasses of wine and a glass of water it was £130. There is very little meat in the portions - it really is two or three pieces. I also asked for a second glass of their excellent Sura wine, but it never appeared.Despite all of this I would 100% recommend this restaurant. They have totally aced the flavours of the gravy and we were literally scraping the bowl. I would certainly return.The butter chicken was amazing, and not spicy. We also had chicken curry and mutton masala which both had very soft heat.Full marks for flavour, but portion/price definitely loses a star.I would question whether they needed the tables downstairs? I strongly suspect going the whole way to traditional Indian dining styles wouldn’t put any potential customers off, and probably invite more.Definitely a hidden gem
5
Unique concept the place has set. The spice levels can be chosen on a scale of 1-10. I would not dare cross 5. The food is excellent and the staff is very hospitable. Would definitely recommend this nice and cosy place for Indian food in Singapore

As we stayed in the hostel right next to Langnaa we had to try the food here! Now we were two girls who aren't really good with spices, but we thought we would give it a try! The owner/woman who worked there was super nice and super helpful! We had no idea what to pick or what new things to try - and of course we did not want our mouths to be set on fire, so she helped us with two nice curries, with two different types of rice, some lovely and yummy bread and some amazing sides.. Unfortunately I can't remember any names of the dishes, but we certainly wasn't disappointed, with the choices made by the owner! We left Langnaa were happy - and super full, so if you fancy a nice India meal, I can definitely recommend this place - and if you are like us, don't really know what you want, you can trust their decision making skills! It was a little bit pricy, but if I am ever in Singapore again, I would definitely come back
3
Lagnaa had always amazing food. Yes, way too expensive, but you were in food heaven. Service was always so so.Our last visite was super dissapointed. Service was very poor; they forgot our drinks, forgot to bring 2 glasses, then didn't being the glass after the remark and so on. Unfortunately they forgot to ask the spice level; so the food was too sweet :( and nothing special anymore. Ordering an additional bowl of Rice or naan takes too long.The bill was 170 for 3 and it was basically no longer worth it. I am wondering... is Lagnaa fading glory or will they improve and shine again
5
With such good reviews online we went to Lagnaa for lunch. The Indian food was the best we'd tasted since being in Asia for a month!!!They cater for all levels of spice tolerance as some dishes allow you to level the spice 1-6. I had butter chicken which was amazing and my boyfriend had the mutton masala. He had a 3 on the spice scale (gaining him a peg on the board) but said he could have gone to a definite 4 maybe 5.They offer a chilli chicken starter which helps you decide which level of spice suits you, I would definitely recommend this as we wish we had done after. It's quite a small restaurant (seating upstairs too I think) so I can imagine it can get really busy in the evenings, so get there early to get a seat instead of hovering for others to finish. We were leaving Singapore the next day, unfortunately, other wise we would have been back for more! The food itself was exceptional but also the service. The lady serving us was very helpful and so welcoming!
5
Noval concept on rating the spice level and challenges, I was a great fun to try this out. and if you achieve some reasonable level of spices your name gets published there permanently
the Lagna family to encourage and support you in the spice challenge
5
Really enjoyed Lagnaa, very good indeed. Food was excellent - first class, and he family who run it are lovely. Will definitely be coming back on our next trip to Singapore.
5
Been visiting this restaurant many times over the years, and once again they don't disappoint.
Food, service and atmosphere is perfect. Can highly recommend this restaurant.
5
We stopped by for lunch, the staff was very welcoming and expat friendly. Cold beers served, good portions for the money, very tasty food. I loved the heat levels you can request, and enjoyed some spicy level 6 curry. Great place to stop.
5
First thing is that the owners and staff are hands down the nicest people. They are happy to give recommendations and generally just chit chat. We stopped for lunch on our honeymoon and we were surprised with a little dessert and candle. So thoughtful. I highly recommend. Great food and great company.
5
A friend who's been to Lagnaa before suggested going there for lunch. Turned out to be a great idea. We had a very enjoyable lunch, chatting with the friendly owners and digging into yummy curry fish, butter chicken, and tender okra served with naan and freshly made dosai (complimentary). I didn't have a chance to read the reviews here beforehand, so without being influenced by them, I was very impressed with the beautiful flavors created in each dish served and quality of ingredients used. We went for a "cowardly" 1.5 spice level this time... will try a 2.5 or 3 next time. The portions are just nice for those who like to enjoy a variety of dishes and feel pleasantly satisfied (i.e. without having to roll out of a restaurant afterwards 
5
I had an absolute blast st this restaurant. The Chef is amazing and the staff is wonderful. We took a cooking class to learn how to make butter chicken and I also tried the spicy curry challenge and made it thru the level 6. A must go if you are in little India
5
We enjoyed a superb meal here the other night. We were greeted by extremely polite hosts who directed us upstairs & to remove our shoes. We were on level 2 where you are sat on the floor, which greatly added to the experience and as we had 4 young children with us, it also helped. We ordered a selection of dishes - butter chicken, dahl, aloo gobi, saag paneer, mutton curry, yoghurt rice (which is really yum), tandoori chicken tikka & tandoori prawn and an abundance of naan breads. We were a group of 7 hungry adults and this was more than enough. Each dish was delicious and flavoursome. They even sell authentic Indian lagers, the names of which set the tone for the content... The Godfather and Knockout! This place is definitely worth a trip.
5
I ate at Lagnaa this weekend with friends and had an absolutely fantastic meal. Would highly recommend the Butter Chicken- there is the option of sitting on the floor barefoot but we had a table as there were a few of us. Excellent service- the owners were so friendly and really made us feel welcome and helped with menu selection and recommendations. We also had the pleasure of taking part of the tandoor oven challenge at the end of the evening which was good fun. Looking forward to our next visit :
4
Was invited to a tasting session at Lagnaa's by a friend and was greeted by the friendliest host and hostess, K7 and Shanti. Along with us were 9-10 other fellow tasters. 10 course dinner with an engaging explanation of the dishes and a crash tamil class too. Dishes were traditional and unlike the usual Indian cuisine that most people were exposed to. Enjoy myself greatly food wise and in terms of the great boisterous company we had too. Would definitely go back again soon!
5
Great food, great service, good location........ Will be back soon. The laguna special dishes are delicious.........
5
We frequent this place offer at the suggestion of Trip Advisor. The food is unbelievable, as is the service. Can't wait to find time to go back for a cooking class!
5
Went straight to a chilli 6 strength but could not go past that, tried the 7, may be next time. Fab food, great quality & staff😀
5
Really good food and excellent service. One of the best curries I've had and the peshwari naan bread was amazing. Also the staff are were very friendly. All round great experience.
5
The team at Lagnaa embody everything great about the hospitality industry. They do everything they can to give a unique experience to each and every person that walks through the door. The food is excellent, the energy is amazing, and if you walk out without feeling that you've made new friends (from K7 all the way to the dishwashers), then you're doing it wrong. If you're lucky enough to have a few minutes with the boss himself, you'll know that passion for food and people, as well as a sense of humor, are the driving forces behind this amazing place. Singapore is spoilt for choices as far as restaurants go, but Lagnaa is always the first thing out of my mouth whenever someone asks about a special place that's more than just great food
5
Lagnaa barefoot dining. Located at 6 Upper Dickson Road, (Little India) on our visit at Little India we decide to try something different for dinner, we had many choices but Lagnaa come to mind. The food was great, different than your usual Indian restaurant, flavorful dishes served up in generous portions. The food that we ordered, especially the Fish Head curry were all excellent. Overall nice atmosphere, and nice food .The waiters and staff was fantastic, they presented flawless service, friendly and professional. The attentiveness and enthusiasm of the service made for an enjoyable, evening. Great place for a real Southern Indian cuisine. Definitely must try if you are in the mood for Indian flavors. I love it that much, I will definitely come back
5
We visited India Town in the evening to see the preparations for Dipavali. We went into one restaurant, but it lacked warmth so we stepped out and so glad we did. A few doors up the road we came to Lagnaa, A really enjoyable evening, tucking into god food and talking to the owners. They have 3 floors - ground, opens into the street, 1st floor for barefoot dining and 2nd floor for private functions. For a curry in Singapore I would have not hesitation in going bac
5
A must go when you are in Singapore! This is the best, most special way of getting to know the real Indian cuisine. Cooked with passion.The staff is very warm, fun and intelligent and make you feel at home so that you can't leave without the feeling you just made new friends. This makes it also easy to go alone or with a group. Real spicy people are able to test how hot they really are and even conquer a place on the wall of fame. Best curry ever! We come back every time when we are in Singapore. Try to go when its full moon to have the real Lagnaa experience. :

This restaurant sits in Little India. Obviously there are many choices for both South Indian and North Indian cuisine. What caught my eye was the relaxed almost traveler lodge Hostel type of feel when you look at their entrance. On that at day I noticed mainly expats clearly enjoying their food and drink. I looked at the menu with my family and we thought we give it a go. Service was not so quick and the restaurant was clearly not that crowded. But the food made up for the lack in service and the price. As I said there are many choices in this area, especially for South Indian food. We ordered Fish Head curry and I must say after 20 years plus in Singapore and other parts of South east Asia, This dish was a delight. Looks can be deceiving but the manager at the time was helpful in explaining about the herbs used and their slant on preparing the dish. BTW they offer classes in cooking and have a scale and a grading system for the amount of Heat that you can handle for spices in the dishes. Overall a 4, they need to work on their timing. But the food made up for it
1
Overall the food was average and the service was below average. Dishes which usually are not sweet were sweet. Prices are on a high side than expected. Even if the whole restaurant was empty, since we came in for early dinner, they still gave us the small table
5
Dropped into this friendly restaurant after reading a review on the spice levels that can be ordered. Sat upstairs (barefoot of course) and thoroughly enjoyed our meals and the ambience.
Would return in a flash.
5
If you're in Singapore and you're up to give your taste buds an aromatic and spicy challenge try Lagna Restaurant where they serve sublime Indian dishes, an absolute delightful experience.
Enjoy 😊👍

I love spicy food, especially spicy Indian food. When we heard about lagnaa (we didn‘t do the barefoot-thing), we had to stop by. Because we just wanted to try it out and dind‘t want to have a full meal, we just ordered a small chicken curry for us two. On the spiciness scale ranging from 1-10 we ordered a 3. I was surprised that I could already feel the burn. So if you‘re not used to spicy food (and believe me, I am) go for a 1 or 2. The food was not just spicy, but also quite delicious
3
We opted for all three specials of the day. The owners were very hospitable and took the orders, offering helpful advice. Our entree went to the wrong table. The remainder of good dishes arrived in a somewhat haphazard order. As we sat by the front of the restaurant we had a succession of people queuing for tables watching us eat our food. I would suggest not taking this seating. The portions of food are small, but the food was tasty. The food was not inexpensive, with 5 beers the cost was close to SGD200 for two. There are many alternatives in the area, but this was fine
3
It was our first night in Singapore and we didn't know where to eat so we checked trip advisor! The good reviews are true but what they don't tell you is that portions are small as opposed to the bill you will get! You can get equally good food in many other spots in little India for way less money.
5
We are regular visitors of this restaurant, and always enjoy the quality of the dishes. For people who compare prices with a foodcourt will think this is expensive but ever felt so good with eating at a foodcourt... probably not as the chicken, rice etc is really close to trash there. So value this one for what it is a real great indian restaurant with honest food. For sure not too expensive and on top great hygiene and quality
4
We had one of the set menus with an additional course, based on advice from the waitress after acquiring what we liked and our preferred spice level. The food was very tasty, abundant and arrived quickly and service was friendly and efficient throughout our visit. This is a good place if you require some guidance as the staff speak English well and make recommendations based on your preferences. It's quite a lot pricier than eating on the street, obviously, but if you're lacking in knowledge and/or experience of street eating this is a safer bet
2
Unfortunately this place is one of those that get a good Tripadvisor rating, they display the certificate of excellence, but don't deliver on food. Service yes, but, food not in terms of taste or value unless you have the apetite of a squirrel. Let's start with the overpriced drinks. $8 for a mint lassi and $12 for Kingfisher beer. Ok, Singapore's not cheap but......Now onto the food. Thank goodness we ordered the large portions or we would have been re- eating at another indian restaurant. That is not to say that 6 tiny pieces of chicken is a sufficient portion. The eggplant dish was the size of two tablespoons. A fish dish of the same size. Two non crispy poppadums and the total was $86. I have spent a month in India, a month in Sri Lanka, live in one of the biggest Indian communities in London so I know good Indian authentic food. Yes, i know each country changes the food slightly but people writing comments like "best and tastiest" are not as well versed in the culinary stakes. You could see this from the overwhelming majority of white customers who came looking for authenticity. Save your money and eat alongside the locals in the stalls. Also ambience was nothing special. Decide for yourself

I ate there a few weeks ago and I was impressed with the food so I enrolled into a group cooking a class. Sadly I came down with a harsh cold and had to cancel on the day of the class. I don't want to go into a public kitchen and hack and blow nose every 15 minutes while trying to cook. GROSS. They did not inform me of their cancellation policy and I requested that I either a refund or attend the next class. NO REFUNDS. Ok, that's fine and they offered me their next class which I could not attend due to a mandatory presence at my school's 85th anniversary. They insisted that they could not push any further and would not offer me another class after July 29th. So they took my 72$ without even an offer of a partial refund or a voucher to use in their restaurant. I'm so disappointed as I thought I found my go to Indian restaurant in Singapore

We went here on recommendation. Should have followed instinct and taken the opportunity to visit one of the many truly authentic Indian eateries nearby in the hustle and bustle of Little India instead as this place is tourist hyped. Veggie dish was more like sweet an sour and non-authentic. Staff were friendly though. Very overpriced for below average Indian food. Made for the guidebooks not for your stomach or wallet
3
Had a lovely meal here food was tasty but portions were very small. They say you should get a few dishes to try but at the prices they charge it costs too much.
5
With a barefoot experience (sitting on the floor) we had very good Indian food. We we're surprised as it is a twice listed Michelin restaurant! Great flavors but beware with spice... even 2 from 6 can be very spicy! Portions are small but very tasty!
5
A buddy of mine is a good friend of K7 who owns & runs Lagnaa, and he suggested we go try their awesome curries and take on their famous Spice challenge over dinner. We arrived and were greeted warmly with friendly banter, and then proceeded to order. Spice level 6 mutton curry for us, accompanied by rice, as we were there for the awesome spiciness & challenge - it was super fiery, mouthwateringly flavourful and very balanced ... a supremely satisfying & sweaty experience! We also had other curries which were less spicy, each uniquely different and delicious, as well as some wonderful naans. I am looking forward to eating at Lagnaa again, and am planning to prepare for the level 7 challenge (by invitation only) which I'd qualified for by successfully completing level 6! Highly recommended, not to be missed when in Singapore
3
There is no doubt the food here can be good. Very good.It can also be average.While we very much enjoyed our butter chicken, raita and even the ghee rice, the pakoras and the naan were pretty standard and the tandoor offerings were quite bland.Add to this the price, which feels set at about 20% more than it deserves, and you may leave your second visit here feeling that twice is enough. And maybe it was one time too many
5
Working in the industry, I find it very difficult to pick a restaurant to dine in and agonise over every decision I have to make. Lagnaa came highly recommended from my online research, so that's what I decided on and I'm so pleased I did. Lagnaa's spice challenge is a great attraction, but they offer so much more than that. From the moment I sat down I was greeted with a smiling and welcoming face and owing to my visiting later on a slightly quieter night and as solo diner, I was invited to spend my entire evening eating and talking with the owners and their friends. It's refreshing to speak to people who are so passionate about what they do. Kaesavan (master chef), can certainly cook, but his knowledge of the history of Indian food and the care he takes in sourcing ingredients and preparing his recipes is what really stands out. From kitchen to the front of house, this is a really impressive operation. Please, take the time to talk to these guys, they will be more than happy to share their passion with you. The food that I sampled was simply outstanding and such a marked difference from the mass-catered Indian food that is so often offered in Indian restaurants, with their base curry sauces carelessly spooned over some some meat or vegetables: if you're after that kind of "pile it high, sell it cheap" thing, please go elsewhere, but if you want to truly try something unique, Lagnaa is the place to go.I hope that I get the chance to return to Singapore and if I do, this place will be first on my list. Next time I may have to try the spice challenge! Thank you Team Lagnaa for really making my evening so special

Walked past and had seen on TripAdvisor before this place....Wow the food was so amazing, best Indian food ever! K7 your hospitality in your restaurant from both you and your staff is warming! We enjoyed our meal and our conversations with you. Thank you for inviting us back and we enjoyed it just as much the second time! Highly recommended and will be back again next visit!Don't forgot to visit us in Australia one day!G&Ny...
5
We had lunch in Lagnaa and it was very good. The food is well done, you get to choose your spice level and the people are awesome. Good mood and always happy to serve. Definitely the place to go in Little India to have an excellent time and great Indian food.
5
We came across this small Indian restaurant and decided to go inside and try some food. The restaurant itself is small but nicely decorated. It was possible to dine upstairs in the traditional way sitting on the floor or sit at the table downstairs. We have chosen the second option. The menu is very good sorted, with a big range of different dishes, so it took us a while to decide. When the decision was made, we've both chosen spicy dishes with chili. It is possible to choose from spicy level one up to six. But be careful! If they say "spicy", they really MEAN IT! :D my husband chose level three and was struggling with his food, it was very hot :D I had level one and it was just perfekt! The food, the quality and the service were superb! The nice lady (probably the owner of the restaurant) asked us about why we are visiting Singapore. And as we told her, that we are on our honeymoon, she was so touched, that offered us a chocolate dessert on the house. The dessert was beyond any expectations, so please feel free to try it, if you are into chocolate. All in all I would definitely recommend to visit this restaurant. You find a very tasty food and lassis for a reasonable price and will definitely not regret it
5
Little India is a great place for a good curry, no shortage of good curry houses but if you want the best head to Lagnaa in Upper Dickson. The owner is super hospitable and the food is incredible. The heat scale 1.5 - 10. The norm for most appears to be 2. Yoghurt Rice was so unique, the individual curries we order were each full of flavor. Can't wait to return for tasting night next week.
4
As its Trip Advisor category indicates, this establishment is a little higher up the price curve than some of the other local Little India eateries, but delicious and thoroughly enjoyable. We tried a variety of items from vege samosa to curries and all were very tasty. Kaesavan is a delightful and entertaining host. Sit at a table and chairs downstairs or on the floor upstairs. Located just off Serangoon Rd and not far from the Indian Heritage Centre, it is easy to find
5
Very spicy, but fun. It's like a contest now amongst us to go up higher levels.
Will be back for more.
5
Just stumbled across this restaurant with my sister and very glad we did! Excellent food, great beer and a reasonable price. Great range of veggie options, would definitely come again.
4
Very good taste of India. Simple place with incredible food and very nice and friendly staff! I fully recommend!
5
Went to Lagnaa for a second time, with two friends. We wanted to have their chicken samosas and masala tea, which is really really lovely but ended up staying for dinner too. Some dishes are their specials, like this time I had salmon tikka which was a unique way of incorporating salmon into Indian cuisine. This was our favourite! We had some garlic naans and butter chicken too. The butter chicken was flavourful without too much butter. Previously, I tried their chocolate naan which I hadn't tried anywhere else before. Great food, friendly staff
5
Shanti at Lagnaa Barefoot Dining was so welcoming and friendly on our arrival for dinner on our first night in Singapore last week! The food was beautiful and authentic and my partner enjoyed his Level 3 experience! Highly recommend at least one visit here during your stay, we even stopped by to say hello / goodbye on our last day!
5
You can always count on Lagnaa for a great meal and enjoyable company! Tried the new salmon dish- don't usually get salmon dishes in Indian restaurants so thought this was something nice and different! Don't forget to order the mango lassi and butter chicken to go along with your meal too- all were a hit with my friends! Special mention to hostess Shanti who was spot on with her recommendation of the popular dishes to try and the spice level for the dishes! Truly enjoyed my meal here and will be back soon
4
This place is warm and very friendly. The people greet and treat you with warmth. The food is good and caters to all, i.e. from a kid to an elderly in terms of taste and spicy levels. Its the only place I found where you can sit down and eat, like home
5
Love this restaurant. It's owned by an older couple, super friendly, really down to earth and rustic whilst the restaurant still having good decor. Their USP is spice levels. The food menu is not very wide but what they do have is all excellent and each order cooked from scratch/fresh. Spice levels are 1-6 and you're given a 1.5 as a starter to give you an idea of the scale. I'm a big curry eater and have eaten vindaloos but I could not go more than 4 so take that in mind! If you do a 4 or above you get a clothes peg to pin on the wall on "level 4" and it gives you an idea of what levels of spice other people can handle. If you've got the stomach or mind to finish a level 6 you're invited back for another "special" evening of levels 7-10! One person has done a level 9 (only 1 peg on that level), and nobody has done a 10.They also do cooking courses there too.Really cool messages/doodles all over the walls from visitors leaving comments and I will definately go again. For those who are not keen to sit on the floor you can eat downstairs with tables/chairs. Great place. If you're in Little India wondering where to go.... this is the place
1
For a moment I thought I was in Gaggan - "haute cuisine" with an arrogant service and high prices... But then I noticed that it was just a place with an over-priced butter chicken, strategically located near backpacker hostels, poor service and with astonishing high delusions of grandeur..If you want to eat real indian food at decent price you can try your luck at any of the restaurants around in little india.. If you get it wrong at least you pay a tenth of what you pay there.

Let me just say--we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will remember our visit for years to come! My husband and I visited Lagnaa for a late lunch while on our honeymoon trip to Singapore. We had just enjoyed ayurvedic massages across the street when I recognized the sign from my guidebook, and decided it looked too fun to pass up.I plopped myself down on one of the sunny sidewalk seats right in front of the fan, and we were guided through our menu options by chef K7 who happened to be sitting right next to us enjoying his lunch. My husband is brave and loves spice, so he ended up doing the chili challenge, with a mango lassi held back in the fridge for dessert (no cheating!). I have heartburn so I stuck with a spinach paneer and lime soda!The service was the best service we had in all of Singapore, complete with full color commentary of my husband's (successful) attempt at the six chili challenge. They also were happy to celebrate our honeymoon with us, and made us feel extremely special and welcome--and it was clear to see they enjoyed interacting with all of their guests in the same way. Yes--it was clear a lot of tourists visit Lagnaa, but for us, that added to the excitement, and was not a drawback.If we ever return to Singapore, we would absolutely return to Lagnaa--maybe visit the upstairs area in the evening for a barefoot experience.The folks at Lagnaa are my favorite thing about travelling--getting to meet locals who love to meet and entertain travellers

Nice people. Food was really just ok. Not overwhelmingly delicious, quite average, and lunch was $80USD for two people...just not worth the price.
4
I visited this place after reading reviews . Did the reservation earlier to avoid disappointment later.They have two levels.Ground level where they have table and chairs Upper level is having bare foot sit on the floor style dining .We tried the upper level. Noticed that the restaurant is famous amongst foreigners. I assume less Indians visit this place for unknown reasons. No one in my circle visited this place in last 10 years.My ratings:Ordering : very pleasant and personalised Service: Good but can be improved Quality of food: goodAmbience : GoodPrice: mid to highNoice level(upper level): very less.The best part of the restaurant was their personal touch and they're concerned about their guests.During my dinner, owner visited and asked about food, services etc. Overall, I enjoyed my meal there and I may visit the place again.Already recommended the place to my friends.All the best
5
Excellent food, warm hospitality and I liked the level of the spice we get to pick for our orders. I had fish head curry and it was delicious with perfect amount of spice on it. Overall I like the food and the hospitality of the owner.Peace ✌️
2
Really not worth the money. The place is OK, the food average, but definitely not a recommended place to try Indian food in Singapore if you only stay there a few days. In 6 years in this city I have seem much better for at least half the price. Be ready to pay SGD 30/40 per person with tax/drinks etc. while 10 to 15 can get you really authentic and tasty food elsewhere in Little India or in the CBD / Raffles Place as Indian expats are very picky about their Indian lunch. Food on Fire and Vatan Se Food From Home In Raffles are a good start in Raffles, and the ones opposite Mustafa center as well for Little India. To the management you should either reduce your prices or enhance your food, your concept really has potential to fly if done well
4
This is not a pretentious Indian restaurant. There is outside seating and a small inside area which does not have aircon. Upstairs, which I have not seen, has seating on the floor so you have to remove your shoes.The lady who is front of house was charming and very informative about all the dishes. I asked about chicken dansak and she informed me I would need to order it a day ahead as could other meals not on the menu. The service was excellent and the food as good as you get. The only mistake was mine in ordering a strong Kingfisher beer which was 8%.I drank it slowly. By the way the curries come in different strengths from 1 to 9, A 2 was enough for me but my son managed a 3. Looking forward to returning in September.
4
We had a nice meal at Lagnaa Barefoot. The mangi lassi was the best I have ever tasted, apparently they make their own yogurt. We had a korma and butter chicken - both were very good. My suggestion to start slowly - order a couple of dishes to share and then add more if needed later the little bowls of curry are very deceiving!Prices are similar to Australian restaurant pricing - do not expect hawker prices as this is not a street food stall. We were happy to pay the extra as it was a lovely meal. Owners were also lovely.If you want to eat upstairs make sure you book
5
I checked Trip Advisor for places to eat in Little India and Lagnaa came up as the top recommendation. My wife and I ordered a level 3 (out of 10) curry but the owner insisted that we only try the 1.5. He told an entertaining story about the food and the rating system whilst we waited for our meals. We probably could have managed a 2 but I'm glad we didn't go for the 3. The food was wonderful and the host returned to our table several times to chat and see how we were enjoying our meal. Definitely a place to seek out in Little India, but take a map as we only managed to find it by acciden
5
Located on a narrow road in Little India, Lagnaa provided a great dining experience. We were made to feel very welcome and were advised well regarding the degree of spicyness. You choose a dish from the menu and then select the level of spicyness, with 1 being the least spicy. I like quite spicy food but was advised to have level 2 and was glad I didn't go higher. The woman serving us said she didn't go above level 3!Lagnaa effortlessly combines simple but interesting surroundings with great service and delicious food. I would definitely go back next time we're in Singapore.The restaurant is wheelchair accessible although Little India itself has narrow pavements, uneven surfaces and some high kerbs to negotiate. I don't think Lagnaa has a wheelchair accessible toilet
5
Lagnaa might be the best indian restaurant I've had in Singapore! I challenged myself and took chicken tikka masala at spice level 6/10 (which is the highest you can get in the restaurant, higher levels are on invitation only, and require to finish level 6). Although being very spicy as expected, the chilli doesn't take over the other ingredients, and you can taste all of them in a perfect balance.Apart of the food, the service was great and the owners are very friendly! Looking forward to go back for level 7
5
We visited this restaurant twice during our week's stay - it was that good. My husband achieved a level three chilli peg :) We didn't brave the authentic barefoot experience upstairs, but the food was fanstastic (even a mild level 1.5) and we were made to feel most welcome
5
This was a great challenge and the food is just great. I recommend everyone to come and check his or her level of Chille Challenge.
4
We found the restaurant in the busy Little India. Really good food and helpful staff who helped us with our choices of meal. If you like Indian cuisine, it's definitely a place to visit in Singapore.
5
If you are looking for a great place to dine in Little India, then this should be at the top of your list. A few minutes walk from Little India MRT and also the renowned Mustafa Centre, this fantastic eatery is located just off Serangoon Road.Here you have a choice of sitting downstairs using tables, benches and chairs or their floor sitting area upstairs, great for those of you who are flexible enough to sit cross legged for your meals.A large range of dishes available with 10 levels of spiciness......having visited with friends who love that kind of lava burning heat, they really enjoyed their meals at level 5 only! - I however cannot take that and managed a 1.5Must try - Butter Chicken, Dory Fish and their Mango LassiThey get extremely busy during dinner and at night, so if you intend to go during these hours then do book via email or phone.The food is delicious, the atmosphere is awesome and the service is great
4
Small, off the street restaurant that delivers big on flavour, mixed with humour, friendliness and welcome by all of the staff. They also have a challenging spice league table, from 1-10. Ten of course being just plain stupid in terms of heat. Not surprisingly nobody had attempted this level. Regardless of which it's worth going just for the food.
4
We tried Lagnaa Barefoot Dining after wandering around Chinatown and Little India ll day. We were excited about choosing our own level of spice and about the barefoot dining experience. I love spicy food - and eat ghost peppers regularly. I tried the level 6 on a vegetable dish and only ate 3 bites. It was totally worth it! The service was great, staff was knowledgeable and the lassi to wash away the spicy was perfect
5
Because our lunch experience was great, we revisited ‘Lagnaa...barefoot dining’ for dinner after few months. Surprised twice, I could not stop myself from writing this review. We reserved a low-table for us at upstairs and had a great time. The ambience is simple and pleasant, especially when you compare with its noisy surrounding areas. Low-laying seating arrangement with cushions is very relaxing. Many items in their food menu is graded for chilliness from 1-10. We tried a 4 level chicken dish. It was heated with a lot of spices but the taste superseded the hotness. May be next time, we will try level 7/8. To surprise one of our friend, we also ordered 'Say it softly naan'. It’s actually a sweet bread made as a dessert. Not only our friend was surprised, but also we were too. They had a puzzle to solve with it. The staff clicked a lot of pictures while our poor friend tried to solve the funny riddle.We had a great time and enjoyed the good food and tranquillity Lagnaa offers. Not to forget, the staff is calm and hospitable and the owners are very down to earth
5
I decided to try out Lagnaa to celebrate my birthday after reading online about the barefoot dining experience. However, I couldn't make it to the restaurant before 08:30 PM and had to settle for the table and chair.The food was great, the ambience is amazing and they even did a surprise birthday celebration for me! Shanthi was very nice and helpful and she really was a pleasure to talk to and seek advice from.Be careful with the spice levels, they really mean what they say!I will surely plan another evening to actually try the "bare foot dining" experience
4
Ate her this evening at our daughter's suggestion. Highly enjoyable, with super friendly and helpful service. For heat lovers, you can order your curry to specific levels of spiciness. The chicken tikka and veggie samosas to start were excellent, and the range of naan bread is spectacular - didn't try the Chocolate Naan but that's one for a future visit. Seating downstairs, and sitting on the floor upstairs if you're feeling limber. The staff are lovely; very friendly and helpful. Big thumbs up from us - we will be back
2
After having reviewed the comments, I had quite good hope and obviously the boss and his wife warmly welcome us and took care of us (like every client actually). However I was very disappointed by the food (I have some references after having travelled 3 weeks across India). Some water with the chicken tikka, one dish of tomato spicy shrimps (sorry I don't recall the name) made of cheap frozen shrimps. Quantities are pretty small. The cherry on the cake has been the bill (>110 SGD for 2).After getting out of the restaurant, I had a look at the menus of the restaurants around. I don't know if food is better over there but at least 3-4 times cheaper and full of Indians..
2
Visited Lagnaa on our first night in Singapore based on such good reviews;Food was not bad at all; but it was definitely not anything special...it was fairly stock standard Indian fare;We has sample sized chicken, eggplant & Dhal with 3 Naan a beer & a lasi.With the total bill being $82.00;If the food & service was fantastic; i wouldn't be complaining...but everything was....ok;Considering the amount of options in Little Indian; there must be better choices
5
The food was good just that they are a little overpriced. The lady by the name of Shanti assisted with the suprise naan for my boyfriend for his birthday at the end of our meal. Glad with the service.
4
My wife and I met a college friend on a brief layover in Singapore. I had been to Lagnaa and had great memories. We arrived late in the evening, so not too many people there to share the great sit on the floor barefoot ambiance. But nonetheless the food was really, really good.We benefited from the perfect recommendations from the owner who guided us perfectly. Everything was spiced to our liking and the beer was nice and cold.I guess it was a bit expensive, but much of Singapore is expensive and for the quality of food probably pretty appropriate
1
The quality as well the portions of the food were really bad. The chicken was rubbery, not a true depiction of Indian food. I wonder why only non-Indians love the food here while actual Indians who know the real taste dislike it.The manager was discourteous as well, when I made a suggestion about the quality & taste of the food being served plus the small portions he was non-responsive and arrogant in saying, "hard luck, everyone else likes our food, go check Tripadvisor
5
As a Brit our love of Indian food is in our DNA and Lagnaa Barefoot Dining ranks up there as one of the very best. The buttered Chicken is to die for. Plus I love the atmosphere with lots of creativity - everything from the Chile Challenge (how hot can you take your curry) to the monthly specials. Well worth a visit
5
Had a fantastic experience!They offer monthly specials. I took chicken in mint sauce - can recommend it.The marketing trick is that they allow to choose different spice levels. I think that level three should be no problem for most people. For the ones who like spicy food, level five is the choice
4
We sat on the street to watch the world go by and keep our shoes on. Upstairs you can sit on the floor barefoot which is quite unusual if you like that sort of thing. More important for us was the wide variety of food available as well as a selection of strong beers - try The Godfather, very nice
1
We didn't enjoy our experience at all. We paid 65 for a price fix lunch that was under seasoned and uninspired. We could not add to the spice level for some reason. Service was awkward and slow. It's a hot open air place. Better food is all around and at better prices. No idea why it's got such praise on Trip Advisor or Lonely Planet
5
The staff at Lagnaa and head chef K7 keeps you excited everytime you visit them. We have enjoyed their signature dish fish head curry once again... While my friend Shankar tried chicken curry with spice level 5 at first time and excited to try level 6 in the coming visit on a full moon day... Lagna looking forward to visit again for the fish head curr
1
Lonely Planet said this was a must do! We weren't allowed to choose a spice level and were made to get level 1. Soooo bland! Needed more salt as well! No air conditioning. Slow service. We had the 2 person pre fix and it cost $65.
4
We took visiting family to Lagnaa for a unique experience. We sat upstairs on the floor cushions and everyone found it slightly uncomfortable as the cushions are not very big! The staff were great - friendly, knowledgable and enthusiastic. While the food was good, we did find that the price didn't 100% match the value and was overpriced for the portion sizes. Would we recommend it? Yes, but remember it's on the pricier side for food in little India
5
Very good food, very strong chili if you want it, great service. Visiting Singapore for the first time and I recommend it.
4
If you are challenger, please try level6 curry! You clear level6, You can option is trying level7.
It is very spicy.
Staff's service is good.
5
Simply awesome food. Courteous staff and in budget dining best spot in singapore for indian food. Great experience
5
My second visit to this excellent Indian restaurant. The staff are so friendly, welcoming and really want to talk about their food. I strongly recommend it. If you're brave enough, you will get to permanently record your visit on the legendary "peg wall".
5
the food is simply sublime and there is a very lovel lady working there. recommendation if you're into Indian cuisine.
4
We all had a nice time having dinner seated on the ground at a low table. The food was good, while somewhat pricey.
5
The most welcoming and fun place to eat curry in SG. Ask Chef to come out and talk to you about the different ratings and don't forget to try at least a five!! Great all round fun and well worth it every time we have been. Always come back to visit.
1
We been there yesterday after seeing lots of positive reviews. We found this place par below out expectation. Ambience, heavily priced and level2 of 10 chilly level , super spicy that cant taste anymore.They certainly needed a huge improvement
4
The highlight of our meal at Lagnaa was the delicious mango kulfi! Without doubt it was the best one that I've ever eaten! I would return just to enjoy that delicious flavour and texture again! The rest of the meal was nice and we enjoyed sitting inside/ outside in this tiny restaurant. The service was swift and friendly.The owner stressed the high quality of the food and while we certainly enjoyed it ( especially the tandoori starter) we thought the meal was a little expensive compared to many other places in Little India. But who cares? With a Kulfi that good, it was worth it!
1
Overrated overpriced - 28S$ for a curry rice and tea masala. What a rip off. In Europe it is nicer better and cheaper.
5
Somewhere I visit on every trip to Singapore - let Shanti or Master Chef K7 choose for you and you won't be disappointed.
5
It's been awhile since we've seen our good friends that run Lagnaa. Shanti, K7 and the team gave us a wonderful happy welcome. While individually joining us at our table we caught up about life, the restaurant and friends. Almost forgot we were in a restaurant !Food was as always - fantastic! Great flavors, combinations, and just the right portions. Delicious. Need to get back to being a more regular visitor. Thanks for a great night

After ordering a 'buddy meal' at $25 each,2 minimum (so let's just call it $50) we expecting a decent meal for 2 to share Unfortunately we were presented with an average portion for 1.. was this an accident I thought, or perhaps more to come..? ..No, this was it The $50 meal Included: Butter chicken (extra $6 to upgrade from the curry chicken so we're pushing $56 now!) with 3-4 small pieces of chicken; a meagre main course for one at most. Accompanying this was an equally average portion of saag paneer, 3 small pieces of fish, 2 naan (the only part of the meal which hints this might be for 2 people to share) and again just one small portion of rice..I'm slightly gobsmacked at the audacity of whoever priced this "deal" clearly aiming at tourists, but I guess nothing will change. The food was good but certainly not fine dining as the prices may suggest. With 2 drinks the bill was way over $80. After leaving verbal feedback about the ridiculous portions, I was told we could have up-sized to the $37 per head "buddy meal" ($74!) which frankly missed my point. Good Indian cuisine needn't be expensive in singapore, with a multitude of options nearby at a fraction of the price. Unfortunately at this place the prices are a joke, sorry to say... Note to the owners: I can see you have many positive reviews and this is clearly a testament to the quality of your food so please take my comments as constructive criticism, not an attempt to deter future customers.Kind regards
5
Fantastic evening and food in Little India. This is not posh Indian Dining in any way but in terms of service, quality of food and a real Little India experience, it can't be faulted. I prefer to sit downstairs (at European tables) but if you want authentic you can sit upstairs on cushions with low tables. Enjoy
3
Went here because it was recommended on TA, it did not disappoint. The food was good but portions were small. It is not a cheap place to eat, but it was worth it for the experience. Sitting on the floor in your bare feet was different for sure. Check it out
5
Apart from food, what we love about this restaurant is it's unique, special atmosphere (dining on the floor - great idea!). The owners are doing their best to make you feel welcome. Their special herbs tea they served us at the end of the meal - a must try! We are definitely coming back
2
The food is okay but portion is very small and way overpriced. There are numerous Indian restaurants in Singapore offering similar or better food at a fraction of the price. Unsurprisingly almost all diners are foreign tourists. I don't think any local who knows a couple of decent Indian restaurants here would ever consider revisiting this place after first try.The ambience isn't even particularly nice either, next to a busy road and very hot and stuffy downstairs. Upstairs is the advertised barefoot section with airconditioning, but staff was very reluctant to let us go upstairs claiming it's fully booked. After we insisted for half an hour, they eventually let us upstairs, and surprisingly it was almost empty there. With such dishonest staff and overpriced food, we won't ever visit again
1
As a business traveller , I have been visiting Indian restaurants all around the world including India as it happens to be my favorite cusine in the world , Lagnaa takes the title of the worst Indian restaurant I have been from a VERY long list of restaurants ... The sauce of the curry was very runny , passed through a blender and you could not find a trace of a substance ... The only taste in my mouth was Garlic ... Not only food was bad , but it was also overpriced ... almost $100USD for a party of two ... One of these cases where a very high Tripadvisor rating is going to fool people ... that after they have visited , will be ashamed to say it was so bad and will most propably give it a better rating than what it deserves ..

I loooove Indian food and had a taste of the real one for a few times in Bombay, Delhi and Hyderabad. We decided to try this place from the good reviews on the internet. The place is easy to find. Just tell taxi driver to go to Upper Dickson Road and look for shop number 6. The restaurant signage was inside the walkway so u wont be able to see it from the road. Just look for hanging string of bottles (beer bottles). The lady was super nice and the menu was large. We had the buddy meal for 2. The middle one with the square. Personally i think it is overpriced. The food came in small portion and it was just enough for 2. It wont do it for 3 as advertised. The price on the menu was per head so it made it 70 SGD for 2. Personally i think it is very expensive based on where it is located. This price u can already have brunch in some nice hotels. The taste of the food was delicious. But because I have tried the authentic Indian food, i know their taste was catered for western. Less spicy and less herbs used in their dishes. Not as rich as the real Indian food. Overall i am still very happy i tried this place. It feeds my Indian food craving.

In the centre of Little India, it has a perfect location. All of the staff are very friendly and join in with their clientele. Our daughter had been to this restaurant a couple of years ago and told us that we would have a good meal here.My wife cannot tolerate onions, which can make a visit to an Indian restaurant quite difficult. The head waiter prepared her a curry with mutton and lentils, from scratch. Not as tasty as the curry that I had but she did not have any problem after the curry.Mango lassi was very good.We thought that the bill was quite expensive, but found that most places to eat in Singapore were
5
Probably one of the best currys I've had. The fish head curry was exetremly good, and well worth trying. The owner clearly has a great passion for his food .
4
The food was very, very good! We only wanted a small lunch and were recommended accordingly. I deducted one star as it turned out quite pricey. The lime lassie was to die for!

Over rated - food lacking flavour, roti and naan no way as good as at the hawkers stalls!!
Over priced, left feeling like we'd wasted $40

We stumbled across this restaurant when taking a walk around the Little India area. It was the busiest place around so we thought we would give it a try.We had vegetable samosas to start followed by chicken curry - level 3 hotness - which was just right for us, we could not have gone any higher and a mutton keema - level 1.5Food was delicious. Not lots but just enough for lunch for 2 people with some rice and a naan to shareVery friendly staff who were happy to offer advice on dishes and the level of hotness to go for

Today we had lunch at Lagnaa. It's a great location in the Little India neighbourhood just about a four minute walk from the MRT station.We had the chicken curry, aloo ghobi and saffron rice. Everything was flavourfull and nicely presented on a wooden lazy susan and garnished with some matchstick vegetables. The lady who served us was pleasant and helpful when we asked about gluten-free items. A bit pricy $47 for two with soft drinks and chocolate frozen dessert. Good experience.

We had gone there with two couples and dined on the first floor-sit down style, very relaxed approach and great for chatting with friends. The food taste however was not good- and way over priced. There are many other places in Little India that one can try- this one is missable
2
I Read about this Restaurant in Trip Advisor and also in Lonely Planet.I went there for my First indian Lunch.1) It was difficult to Locate, as there is no sign board from the main road.2) Food is not good (North indian food is Sweet)3) Service is just Bad (on asking for a glass of water, waiter said that you have to get it yourself from the kitchen)4) and above all this ,its not cheap.this is the First Time, Trip advisor Review Failed in this case.I was really wondering about the authenticity of this place
5
Lagnaa came highly recommended. The food is excellent. The chicken tikka masala was brilliant. I went for a spice level of three and it was pretty hot so it is better to err on the side of caution on the spice level. The atmosphere was jovial and it is an ideal place for a brilliant Indian meal and fun evening. The staff were all friendly and the service was excellent.

This place stands out among a bunch of very much for-the-locals eateries in Singapore's Little India with its defiantly backpacker-friendly ambience (credit cards are accepted! there are fans!) but the food is fortunately a lot better than that may lead you to expect. A lot is made of how hot what you're ordering will be and whether that will place you on the Wall of Fame or not, but everything we went for (breads, rice, curries, starters) was uniformly delicious as well as challenging. Perhaps best of all is the extremely friendly service, which stood out against the rather more po-faced experience at many of Singapore's East and South-east Asian places we also tried
3
Discovered this place 6 years ago and loved it so much I make a point of returning every time I am in Singapore. Was very disappointed this visit as the food really lacked flavour and did not stand out as it used to. The prices were high and when you compare to the many amazing offerings in Singapore it just wasn't worth it
4
A great atmosphere with fun and friendly staff/owners. As a dining experience this was unique and the service was smooth.
3
We tried the tasting menu, really good but not much food so we thought it was a bit pricey. Nice and friendly staff!
5
Just love this restaurant. The food and service are great, always with a smile and good advice. Strongly recommend when you are around little India.
5
Yummy food! Will highly recommend! Dared to try the Level 4 of 10 levels of Spiciness! Service staff were extremely friendly and polite. Offered excellent suggestions on menu. Chef came out to mingle with us too. Was a overall jolly feel!
5
Love this place- the staff are so welcoming and friendly. The food is amazing, and well who doesn't love a chilli challenge!
5
The food in this place is amazing. Been visiting these guys for about 10 years and the quality of their food has been consistent. Do try out their spicy challenge. But be warned, their level 3 itself burns!
4
They really mean barefoot - you take your shoes off to go upstairs and sit on the floor at low tables - not great if you are older or have joint problems (FYI). Visited with the husband and had a set meal, the medium option, which was S$35 per person. That plus non-alcoholic drinks came out to be S$94 total. Don't get me wrong, the venue has great ambiance, and the staff were absolutely wonderful. The food was very tasty, but we did not eat/drink what we paid for in the end. There is a nearby area with hawker stalls, and you could have had a similar meal for S$25 or less - the dining experience would have been quite rough in comparison though. So, I recommend this restaurant for good food, contemporary Indian cuisine, but not for its value.
5
I have been in Lagnaa a 2 or 3 times. Last week I took part in a food tasting. It was incredible, we were offered 9 dishes: meat, vegetables, curry; one delight after another. We had to rate them and choose the 3 best: it was a hard job!!. The excellent presentation, the attention to detail, the range of colours, smells and tastes flooded the mouth and the senses. I will come back
5
We visited Lagnaa for a curry with a friend visiting Singapore and we absolutely loved the experience. The food was fantastic and the staff were super. Some people say that the meals are expensive and I disagree, the pricing is exactly right for a the quality of the food you get (certainly not expensive). It's a special place to enjoy a meal and has quickly shot to the top of our list of preferred places to eat in Singapore. We opted for a level 3 and a level 4 curry experience which was a spice challenge but beautifully cooked and presented. I will definitely be back to try the level 6 and hopefully qualify for the full moon parties! After dinner the master chef stayed back to chat with us and we quickly lost ourselves in his expert knowledge of food and produce for another 30 minutes before leaving :D We really cannot recommend this place enough! Can't wait for some cooking lessons from the master chef himself in the not-to-distant future and will be back to feast very soon

We visited the restaurant for a take away yesterday after seeing the reviews at trip advisor. We walked around 10 mins just to get at the restaurant cause we read such amazing reviews. We did a take away as we had a toddler who was quite irritant at that time. We realised the quantity was so poor and priced quite high. I found Komalas veg restaurant had authentic tastes of South Indias dishes but was quite disappointed with Lagnaa
4
Really nice curries and rice! Had also mango juice. Had a nice personal chat with the owner! So comfy to have customized spiciness in your food! It definitely worths a visit while in little India
5
I'm always dubious when I see a restaurant that's been highly rated for so long. I'm glad I went against my instincts today! Take the managers advice about your choices, it won't disappoint ;)
3
The food is good but it's the typical place where you just find tourists, not local people and it's really expensive. I think you can find better places for a more reasonable price.
5
Try the various spicy level dishes.
The food was average, people were friendly, and welcoming. Want to try the spice level 3 which I.feel very spicy.
A must try and highly recommended.
5
I would give this restaurant 6 out of 5 if I could! Food was brilliant, we had a lovely chat about the food so an educational experience too. We sat upstairs on the floor in the barefoot section which added to the enjoyment and we were given a very special surprise dessert to celebrate our special occasion. Overall hospitality was great, food was superb and we would definitely go back. Please book as they do get busy!!!
2
Nothing to write home about except the price: Â£9 for 4 small pieces of chicken tikka. A typical tourist rip off, looks cheap but no locals or expatriates in sight. The drinks are phenomenally expensive. The rice portions were small as were the servings of the other dishes. The interior is tourist tatty and the lavatory floor was swimming in water? My wife hopes.
2
Prices here are extremely high for the area and the portions are not very large. The single portion curry is 12$ per plate and for that cost I would expect to have enough to eat with my naan. However, I found myself running out of curry nearly halfway through my naan. Before you try this place I HIGHLY suggest you go to one of the other places nearby first because they are just as good and your money goes a lot further. Service here was good, but not enough to make up for the small portions and high prices. Btw, make sure to try and get a seat on the top floor since the bottom floor doesn't have air conditioning.
3
We had a late lunch in this tiny place. We chose it because they serve beer unlike most of the restaurants in Little India. Curries come in different grades of hotness you can choose from (the scale is from 1,5-6). Unfortunately, you could taste the chilli powder that had been added to create more heat. This is not the way it should be. We had the chicken curry and jalfreezi vegetables and unfortunately they came with identical sauces which was dissapointing. The staff could have mentioned this upon ordering. Don't order the garlic naan bread, it's not real naan.
4
You can't find Indian dishes like these in Chicago. Everything was perfection. Don't miss the Yogurt Rice! I was very upset to learn we couldn't sit upstairs, even though they weren't crowded. I did feel like they were trying to up sell us on food. Putting both of those points aside, the food was amazing and the staff were very friendly. We will be coming back
5
Took my better half for a dinner at lagnaa. The people were welcoming and clarified all my questions on the spicy challenge and the restro activities. Tried level 4 and my name was on the wall yay J. The food was ok and bit expensive though, but the experience was fantastic. Will definitely go and try higher levels. Must try and highly recommended
5
An enjoyable experience and the food was very nice. I had a lovely chat with the owners who told about the family history of chefs. They also provided some lovely advice of where to get some other Indian delicacies for tasting.
5
Found this place whilst wandering around little India, beer was ice cold, service and welcome were fantastic and the curry's superb
Wife had the chicken tikka masalla I had the Goan prawn curry both were delicious
4
Sometimes you just need a spicy curry without all the fluff and this is the place to go. Friendly staff and a relaxed atmosphere. Dare you have a level six curry.
5
It was my first time in an Indian Restaurant. The place is located in Little India, not far from Mustafa Market Center. We heard about this restaurant from our italian friends who live in Singapore.The food was fantastic. You have 7 level of chili intensity.We took starters both seafruits and chicken.I highly suggest to take the chili chicken to see which is the level you wanna try. Afterwards I choose level 3 and it was pretty hard, tasty and funny.From 3 to 7 they propose you to have a clip with your name and you can have it only if you finish it without share.Great food! Great experience!Highly suggested.Enjoy!D
3
Bottom line: Very friendly service with good food. $70 for 2 person lunch set + Mango Lassi + Masala Tea + bottled water + Tiger beer = $114.00 SPD or $80.00 US.When you head down Upper Dickson Road, be on the look out for the hanging beer bottles from an archway and you'll find this place. Oh, there is also a chef statue with chili pepper printed pants that will also tell you you have arrived.Took a seat at one of two sidewalk tables and ordered one of their "Buddy Meal" lunch sets for 2, which included Chicken 65 (fried chicken pieces slightly spicy), Dory Fish Curry, Butter Chicken, Aloo Palak, Garlic Naan, and just enough basmati rice for 2. They also served us papadum with a side of mint sauce for $1.00 extra. Best dish was the Butter Chicken (nice slightly sweet sauce) and the Dory (oh, I get it now) Fish Curry. The other thing they served which was also very good was their dosa (fermented crepe) which you could also cook yourself at the table if you cared too.For the price, it was much more than I had anticipated paying for but it was good nonetheless. My wife and I just considered this meal our "expensive meal" for the day :-

This is a two storeys restaurant. The upper floor is characterised by very low table and no shoes are allowed. Downstairs, there is an open space, normal tables and shoes are allowed. I personally liked the set up downstairs. The chef was initially sitting close to my table and gave me suggestion on what to choose according to the spice level I like. I went for butter chicken, sesame naan and saffron rice. Everything was cooked to perfection and yummy. The service was also great. I definitely recommend this place. If you are in Singapore and craving Indian food, this is the place to go!

One of the worst Indian restaurant in Singapore. The restaurant is difficult to be found. Once i found it i asked the old lady who im not sure if she was the owner or just a waiter " why you dont add a sign so people can find you easly and her reply was totally rude "we dont want".Anyways, i ordered the food and i was shocked to receive 2 peaces of what they call it "palak chaat" as small as my fingers for 16 dollar. The quality of food is just avarage and nothing special here at all. The restaurant is very small and i really wonder why they charge so high ? Im not sure how they got awarded from tripadvisor but this restaurant doesnt have any quality to be recommended.Lunch , 16.12.201
5
We tracked it down via trip advisor, we had a party of 5 of which they couldn't sit us downstairs, The nice lady said well we have an upstairs dining area. Up we went to the 1st floor, eager to see whats inside, a nice surprise was 6 small round tables where you sat upon the floor with a comfortable cushion also. We were the only people there for the next 90mins. We ordered meals so all 5 of us could share plus recommendations such as yoghurt rice with a particular dish (beautiful) and some of there wine. We all were very satisfied with the experience which will remember with fond memories, Thanks Lagnaa bare foot dining ( ps...we had too remove our shoes for the upstairs area which was cool & airconditioned and great personal service
1
Me as a spice food lover went to this restaurant along with my husband.The food was very disappointing and was way too costly for the quantity they served.And the taste of the food was terrible , i was able to smell the raw masala/chilly powder taste in it.Will never head to this restaurant again

Okay, this place is not only about great food... it's about a great experience! I was staying at The Inncrowd Hostel just around the corner and up the street a bit; maybe a 10 minute walk so very convenient. There are so many places to eat here in Little India, how does one choose? I pulled up Trip Advisor and right at the top of the list was Lagnaa's Barefoot Restaurant. I read several of the reviews and despite the caution of price that some reviewers posted, I decided to spurge. I was so glad I did! The cuisine was exquisite and the staff was so friendly and helpful helping me decide on a vegetarian meal for my particular taste buds. Of course if you have read some of the other reviews, you know about the Spice Chart Challenge. The chart goes to 10 and I chose 3 which was fairly spicy but tolerable. You need to clean your plate at a 3 or above to get your name clothes pinned to the chart. Quite frankly, I could handle a step or two higher but then the spice over powers the subtle and delicate flavors. K7, the owner/chef says he personally doesn't go above level 2. If you don't mind not getting your name on the chart, I would also recommend level 2.K7 is so personable and interesting. We struck up a conversation that could have lasted for hours! I ended up returning the following day before they got busy, experienced more excellent Indian cuisine and was able to spend more time conversing with the chef. What a great experience! I highly recommend trying this place. You won't regret it
5
Love the place, great food great staff, found K7 to be so interesting and passionate about there food.
5
Make sure to stop here for lunch during your visit to Little India. The entire team was so friendly and the food was wonderful.
We're not big on spicy, and they made it just perfect for us. Everyone there was enjoying their experience.
3
Would have to be the most overpriced Indian food in Singapore. Mediocre food and venue. Friendly staff doesn't make up for this basic dining experience. Don't expect anything special.
4
Very easy to find. The staff were really helpful in recommending what to eat. I do not like spicy food and even the veggie korma was too hot for me, but lots of vegetarian options.

Wandering around Little India I was hungry for an authentic Indian meal and Lagnaa came up as one of the top suggestions on TA, as well as scoring a mention in Lonely Planet, so I figured it had to be worth trying. Located just off Serangoon Road on Upper Dickson Road, it's so nondescript that we actually walked right past it. Lagnaa has several classic touristy elements (the witty menu, the bright yellow tiled walls on which tourists can leave comments, the rows of pegs denoting competitors in the spice challenges, barefoot dining around low tables) which is why it attracts so many foreign guests. The owner K7 is very personable engaging with all his customers. We started with Masala tea, which they brewed really well - right amount of spices, together with what I assumed was complimentary pappadums - as we hadn't ordered yet. Keen to have a genuine feed and having a high chilli tolerance I was fine with having a 'hot' dish but I hadn't done my research and K7 then proceeded to school me in the rules of the restaurant's chilli challenge. Personally I would have started with a level seven but I was instructed that I'd have to earn my spot so I had to settle for level six. After travelling around India at the end of last year I had a fair idea of how i needed to tackle this. I was a little surprised at the small size of the servings provided but K7 assured us it was quality not quantity that was important. The meat in the curry was moist and succulent the chilli had some bite but was no where near as hot as all the hype had made it out to be. After another Masala tea, it was that good, and pegging my name to the level six line, K7 advised that I would be invited to the level seven challenge at their next full moon party - shame I wouldn't be in Singapore, as I think I could easily manage a level eight. What did surprise me was the cost of the bill. For the two of us it came to just over $100, which considering the size of the servings and the relatively small number of dishes came as a shock (and the pappadums weren't free either). If I paid that much at a good Indian restaurant in Australia I would expect to be bloated, whereas here I still was a bit hungry (and it was only lunch, imagine the cost if I was buying dinner). I mean the dishes were tasty but I've had much better in India and at home. If you are looking for value for money there are plenty of other restaurants just as good in Little India, just check where the locals are eating not the tourists

This was absolutely great curry. A must try if you are in Singapore. I wanted to have a very good curry since I left South Africa in 2009. My wife went there with business colleagues, so she recommended we go give it a try......The Mango lassi was bliss before the food.....The food came and it was awesome. I ordered the number6 in hotness. Not for beginners, my wife and mother-in-law had mild, which also tasted amazing.Going again on the 14th of December to try number7 burn....
4
The spicy challenge is the perfect group-bonding activity. You get to put a pin with your name on the wall and sign the registry if you complete the challenge. Level 6 is intense! Can you take the heat?Very friendly staff, good service. Staff even emails you photos / video.
5
Cool place to try great Indian food in Little India, and a spice scale that's worth the visit alone! I only wish I could have eaten more, and I also wish that I lived in Singapore so I could return to try the hotter dishes (by invite only). One day..
5
We visited Lagnaa upon our trip to Little India for lunch and we were not disappointed! We enjoyed pakoras, pumpkin curry, Ghana masala, chapati and popadoms, all suitable for our vegan diet!The curries were fragrant, flavoursome and just the right amount of spice! Thank you for a delicious lunch!
5
What a place! The food is marvellous, it's so tasty you can't stop yourself! Staff is friendly. It's a little bit complicated to dine with the infant because you leave your stroller downstairs, but staff makes everything to entertain guests including kids:) If you are spicy food fan - there are 10 levels of spice . But if you are asking for non spicy food, they can really cook it for you
4
Welcoming reception at this simple, delicious place. I ordered a level three spicy which earned me a clothes pin.
Look for the sign on the street and the footsteps painted on the ground to get you in.
3
This is an unpretentious restaurant with excellent food, including some more unusual dishes. Our masala chicken and bean & potato curry were great, washed down with some cold Kingfisher. Definitely worth the trip from the Marina to Little India.
5
This place is amazing as is the chilli challenge I plan on doing until the end!! I highly recommend this place for groups and those of you who fancy a challenge 👌🌶
4
As soon as we entered the restaurant the staff was really helpful and informative. The food was really nice. The flavors amazing the spices exceptional. I would visit it again in order to taste a 5 from the chili level. If you love spicy chili food this is the place to visit.
4
I went there alone and got a table at 1st floor.Food was good and the staff there were very friendly and kind.I had mutton keema curry and garlic fish tikka with naan.The lady took my order made my curry less spicy (level 1.5) for me because I asked if it's really hot but yet it was pretty spicy. The fish and naan were great though.Overall it was good but I will recommend going with friends so you can have more choice of food
4
Meals are rated out of 10 for their Chilliness in relation to Scoville Units. The hottest dish they let you try as a first timer is level 6. You put a peg on the wall with your name if you're successful. I'm keen to go back to try a level 7. If you complete level 8 you photo is put on the wall. Only one person has complete level 9. I tried a former world record Chilli paste from the Chilli factor - that would be 15 on this scale (not a whole meal!
5
I had been told by a friend who travels to Singapore for business that this place was special. The ambiance is simple but the food is excellent. I ordered off the monthly specials and was treated to a fantastic combination of fresh fish and great flavors. Definitely worth seeking out in Little India.
5
Good Indian food based in Little India tucked away we nearly missed it it does not look a lot from the outside we only tried it as it had a Trip advisor sign outside but the food was great not cheap but you only get what you pay for. Staff very helpful and freindly and spoke to Kaesavan the Head Toe (Chef and Owner) Very informative they also do cookery lesson
3
Loved this quirky little Indian restaurant with its varied offerings of authentic Indian food - cooked according to your chili rating preference. Delicious.Was a little surprised at the price as we had expected to have an economically priced meal by actually going to Little India. Food was very tasty and owners very helpful accommodating; however servings were small. Restaurant is licensed; but corkage of 35$ Singapore seems a little excessive for a neighbourhood eatery.Rating of 3 is based on value for money - and doesn't reflect the quality and taste of the food
5
This small hotel in Singapore, serves the best fish head curry in Singapore.. probably in the world... Their chilli chicken (indian style) is just out of the world... They also have customized levels of spicyness (hot) from 1 to 10 as per the guest's choice... The masala, what seems to be used in cooking is sourced from its best origin, looks like... Which brings the best taste for the food... Thanks to the chef's for serving such a tasty indian cuisine... Last but not least Mr Kesavan (we call him K7) is an amazing personality... And its very rare to see such people in the restaurant business now a days... Thanks May Soon for introducing such a wonderful place in Singapore...Karthi
4
I ate with a Friend and we were both impressed. Very attentive service (very helpful) to translate the whimsically written menu. Spice levels adjustable and the food very good. Sitting on the floor.....not for all
5
Best Indian in Singapore. Eccentric, authentic, exciting and delicious! They go the extra mile to Ensure you get a truly tailored curry, combining you likes and dislikes, how hot you think you can go (you can't, but don't stop trying!) to create a totally unique experience. Just go.
5
Nice place tucked in a corner of Little India, nice concept/ambience where u need to remove your shoes and sit on a cushionFood portion was a good size for small eaters like my partner and I.Some of their dishes are also unique and can't be found at other Indian restaurant
5
Located in Little India, this gorgeous little place was chosen by one of my colleagues for a special business dinner. The hosts were very gracious and attended to us in the upstairs dining room. We had a preselected dinner menu, and I couldn't be more complimentary of the food! Thank you for a lovely experience and great dinner! I will be recommending your place to all of my friends!
2
I had a chance to visit this place yesterday with many of my friends from different parts of the world including people from Colombia, Netherlands, States and off course India :-)I will say ambience it's USP but you need to be beware of these greedy people who will be writing orders for you, our experience was bad. If "A" person is taking care of order on behalf of all, they will silently ask "B" that order is very small and you should add one more dish for sure. They will urge non-indians to order as rubbish starters as roti and naan without any curry as starter, holy crap!!They will deliver more drinks at your table even if you haven't ordered all and off course they will charge.Worst part is after we were done with food and payment, restaurant person came to us to know how was the food. When we gave feedback that Dal Makhani could be better instead of accepting with hospitality, he defended back saying "you make it yourself". Is this you call hospitality, crap all!!Very money minded people!

We visited this place as it had good reviews on trip advisor. Unfortunately we found it to be extremely overpriced. Uncomfortable seating also as you have to sit on the floor on a very small cushion. This would be fine if the prices reflected the 'traditional' feel they are trying to create. The food was served in extremely small portions -only 4 small pieces of chicken in the curry and barely any vegetables in the jalfarezi. The naan was small and equal to a serving for one. Still hungry, we decided to order some vegetable Samosas. They were served on a tea cup saucer and only filled the middle part of the saucer where a tea cup would normally fit - approx 2x2cm each max. They cost $12 SD! I would happy pay $4 EACH for an oyster, but for a tiny ball of floury dough? Very disappointing flavour too, given they were very flour heavy and not deep fried as would be expected. When attempting to order water (which wasn't offered when taking order) we were told that we had to go outside by the toilet- the tap water was self serve. With prices like this, you would expect they could at least bring the tap water to the floor where you are sitting. In summary, the restaurant is set in the middle of Little India yet charges 5 star prices for OK but minute portions of food where you must sit on the floor. We were surprised on receipt of the bill, given the tiny portions of food received. We were also told that 'the staff have to carry the food up the stairs!' (To justify the 10% service charge). If I wanted to walk to the kitchen and pick up the good myself I wouldn't have visited a restaurant!On the positive, the room was air conditioned, but we weren't allowed to sit near the window as requested as those tables were 'reserved'. (They remained unoccupied throughout the duration of our hour long visit). I understand the title of the restaurant clearly states 'barefoot dining'-but you would not expect to pay top end prices in such a place, nor receive Lego man sized portions of food for your money
5
I had a great time at the food sampling session organised by the restaurant. The hosts and chefs were all really nice and it was a great experience to dine alongside other people and decide together on which dishes were the best. Food was great too.
4
The family that owned the restaurant is very nice but the food was basic. The butter chicken was excellent but overpriced and the portion were small.Our dinner for 2 cost around 70 for 2 butterchicken, 1 rice, 1 naan and 2 beers..I recommande this restaurant if you want to eat in Little India, otherwise it is not worth it
5
Simply love this place. My favorite Indian dining place in Singapore. The chef is awesome and can these guys cook! The balance of flavors and heat is just perfect. I travel a lot, a hell of a lot and always looking for those little gems to get that perfect culinary experience. If you like food, not a cheapskate and willing to pay for great quality tasting food then this place is for you. This is my third visit in 6 weeks!
5
We had a tasting experience at Lagnaa Barefood Dining last night and it was so delightful. Not only was the food phenominal but the service was great and also the staff so pleasant and friendly. This is one of my favourite places to eat in Singapore
4
Excellent time there. Food was really spice but I enjoyed a lot also with the company of the owner of the restaurant! IT shall be tried when in Singapore!
3
The food is undoubtedly good. However, if you are looking for hospitality - this place earns a zero. Yes, you may be treated differently if you are an expat.
3
While the owner K7 was friendly and the food was above average, it's extremely overpriced. I ordered mint lassi, fish curry, bhindi(okra), rice and cheese naan. Total $52sgd, $37usd for 1 person. Although I liked the portions bc I'm not a big eater, I was able to finish everything except half a piece of naan. Sitting on the first floor, perhaps I didn't get the full experience of sitting barefoot upstairs on a cushion. Regardless, I don't see how it could justify the price. Please spend your hard earned money elsewher

Having lived in Singapore for almost 5 years, and having been a vegetarian for almost 2, I have had the privilege of eating some beautiful and authentic curries in this region. I had heard about Lagnaa from many friends and wanted to give it a try out of curiosity more than anything. I was disappointed to find it to be everything you'd expect from a typical 'tourist haunt'; overpriced dishes, small portions, bland food and a spice'o'meter gimmick on the wall to entice travellers. I found the place was setup to take as much from you and give as little back as possible - and I won't be going back - spent 60 SGD for 2 and were still hungry when we left. Best thing about it was the mango juice

Found this restaurant after reading Trip Advisor. So glad we did. Quirky little place in Little India that you would probably just walk past. Dined upstairs at the low tables where you must remove your shoes and sit on cushions. You can sit at normal tables downstairs but I loved the atmosphere of upstairs. Had the best Indian food ever wiith great guidance from the staff. Kumari was a wonderful hostess and the staff were delightful. Highly recommend this restaurant

The Chicken Sambal is delicious with a nice spice and sauce ratio. The naan was very well cooked and the vegetable dishes tasty and healthy! The people are friendly and the service was timely. The place is not huge so arriving a bit early or later helps
5
Owners were extremely friendly and very helpful on the menu choices and most importantly on the spice level selection. I love spicy food and thought a level 3 wouldn't be enough for me but boy was I wrong. Good back heat and amazing taste. Best Indian food I've ever had!
5
We went to Little India to wander around and stumbled on this wonderful spot. We chose the set menu for ease and were not disappointed! The fish tikka was delicious as was the curry chicken and paneer laoo. The only thing better than the food was the conversation with the staff and proprietors. This is a must stop for quality handmade Indian food in Singapore!

This little restaurant in a classic building provides a relaxed atmosphere in which to enjoy fairly authentic Indian food. As there were 8 of us, we got a fixed menu (for simplicity's sake) and were not disappointed. For my tastes, the food could have been spicier, but perhaps the chef was affected by the size of our group and the need to please all. It seems a place with a potential to please the adventurous

Price is too over neither food nor beverages. a cup of hot tea is 6$ while bowl of rice is $2, a curry start from 15$ but the taste is just an instant curry paste in the boil water. Especially chicken butter, poor taste, just chicken grill in the instant curry paste. Curry itself is taste nothing.If you looking for a place to experience an Indian food or Indian curry then this restaurant is not your choice at all.Honestly, we found this restaurant accidentally on TripAdvisor then we follow to experience and now we know and highly aware of all top top rating restaurant on TripAdvisor.Service from the owner is just fine.Overall is disappointing
5
We loved the food as well as the strategy to make us eat spicy food - if you want too that is. It's a must in Little India and get you peg up on the wall!!! Wayne and Penny
5
Staff is super friendly. Chicken curry was top notch! Naan was great too. I would definitely recommend. A little hard to see Just look for the bottles hanging from the arch in front.
5
Such a fantastic experience. The staff are incredibly and the food is out of this world! Try and get on to the free food tasting event they hold, you learn about the origins of the food and a little about the language too.

One of our most mediocre experiences with Indian food in Singapore. Food was simply bland and service was poor / snooty. - We asked for water and were told that they serve bottled water at the table; tap water we would have to go get from the kitchen ourselves. - Their upsize portions were what I'd consider standard size portions anywhere else. Ordered palak paneer and navrattan korma (chef's special). Both were simply tasteless, especially the latter. Didn't even look anywhere close to what the dish is supposed to be. - Asked the chef when we were waiting for a dish and got a very disinterested answer. - The mint lassi and the mango kulfi dessert were good. The naans were decent.Perhaps the tastes suit travelers to Singapore who come for the first time, but I feel that you just need to stumble into any other joint in Little India to get a better food experience

Having travelled in excess of 1.5 million miles on business over the last 20 years, I can safely say I've visited some nice restaurants and some not so nice. The one that pulls me back time and time again is Lagnaa, that little hole in the wall in upper Dickson Singapore.K7 the master chef has, in my mind hit upon a winning formula. Look, as a Brit, our national dish is now curry and the flavours and spice levels you get at Lagnaa are second to none.Cranberry Nan, an interest spin on a classic but... once tried you will never want any other kind of Nan.K7 and his staff are always so attentive and now I don't even ask for the menu, I have his staff select my main dishes for me. I have never been let down by what turns up.The theme of the restaurant is the spice level of the food, I never go above spice level 3 as I like to be able to taste the best ingredients rather that the burn.I have never been able to find something like Lagnaa else where in the world not even at ABC Farms in Pune or brick lane in London.Keep doing what you do K7 and looking forward to my next trip to Singapore already!

We went on our first night in Singapore as it was a short walk from the hotel and had such good reviews on Tripadvisor.We thought the food was ok, certainly not bad, but certainly not in the top 30 restaurants in Singapore.We were also surprised at the cost, the final bill came to almost 70 SGD for two and we shared a starter and only had one main course and a selection of sides.I ordered a chef special (19 sgd) which was 4 pieces of chicken, which was tasty but not great value for money, especially as this was put on our table a few minutes before my rice and the rest of our order, so it was getting cold by the time I started to eat it.We thought that the staff were helpful when we placed our order.All in all, a very average meal, quite expensive for what it was, and we don't understand why it has such high reviews.We have much better curry at home in London for less money and higher quality service and ingredients

Not easy to find, but worth the search, is this Jewel of a restaurant in little India. We asked to sit upstairs and sat barefoot on cushions on the floor in a tranquil air conditioned space. Just what we needed after walking around on a very hot day. We were advised to start with the chicken taster, to see how spicy we would like our food to be. Good idea. We made it to spicy level 1.5 out of 6 (today being a normal day. On festival taster days, the spice level goes up to a staggering 9!). Bunch of tourists that we are . The food is made to order and thus you have to wait a few minutes for it to be served. No problem, we had a banana lassi (a home made yoghurt, iced fruit smoothie) while we waited, which was very nice and refreshing. The chicken taster was melt in the mouth gorgeous. Our mains were the chicken Korma and chicken Tikka, with rice and garlic Naan which we both recommend. The flavours are so full and lovely. One small minus was the fact that our Naan bread was served about 15 mins after the chickendishes, which we had eaten by that time. Prices reasonable, food quality great
5
A great place to eat great Indian food! I really love the "butter chicken", you canÂ´t get a better gravy here in Singapore. you can choose a spice level, so you can customize the food to your taste. The stuff is very friendly and helpful. I like the fact, that there are some outside tables
4
The restaurant helped us understand their chilli scale with a carefully selected starter that allowed everyone to pick the right heat level for subsequent dishes.Food was great and I enjoyed that rare luxury of a meal hot enough to feel, but not so hot as to hide the flavours. Only one person in the party struggled with the lowest chilli setting for their selected dish, but other dishes, spicy but not hot, were also available
4
Food was good but the unique scoville test you can go through at Lagnaa is a special experience. Prior to lagnaa i never knew there is a unit to measure pungency of chilli. We attempted level 4 and 5 and it was really hot. Service was ok and we appreciate the chef coming and explaining details on scoville levels.Overall must go place and nice food
5
Don't let the appearance fool you. This simple restaurant has amazing food and great service by the owners. The rice with raisins and spices was delicious.
It's difficult to find since the sign is not very visible, but the address is accurate.
5
From the outside u might keep walking... but then u would miss the great food and great service that waits inside. Was referred by a friend who lived in Singa for many years and we loved every mouthful. Thanks K7!
5
Try the delicious butter chicken and combine it with the cranberry naan.
I never write reviews on Trip Advisor, but this place has everything: atmosphere, coziness, delicious food, and extremely nice waitresses and owner.

Had booked for 15 people for our monthly Indian curry club evening but at the end 21 showed up so they had to rearrange tables and get some extra food in. The food was great and arrived shortly after we sat down. Portions could have been a little bigger so we ordered some extras not only big group also high eaters. That with the nice beers made a great evening. There high light was the curry number 6 challenge. One guy from it group had his name amongst those who completed the bowl completely. Over all a great evening
1
The food was okay, the owner I think has a horrible personality on two ocassions we were actually told that if the crowd gets too much we would have to move on after the meals and not sit too long chatting (we had coffees). The irony was that it was empty
4
Been here twice. Love the garlic naans, enjoyed the tandoori chicken and fish on both occasions. Can determine spicy level. Even though I love spicy food, level 5 was the max that I could go. Tried level 6 and did not enjoy the food as much due to the burning sensation from the chillis.Recommend that you go to the 2nd level for the aircon and quiet ambience unless you have problems with barefoot dining or have difficulty seating on the floor. No issue with service although the Indian chap who served us has some difficulty with English but that's really not a problem as the lady boss speaks fluent English if you need help. Serving takes a while though so be patient. Kitchen is surprisingly clean.Paid S$60-70 for each meal, 3 dishes for 2 to share

Tucked away in a little corner of Little India, it was 3 years before I discovered this joint - and I'm an Indian who visits this part of town more frequently than most. There are no Indians dining at this joint - my first impression of this place was that its a fusion place that appeals to expats from the west. You know the types..not spicy at all, with food most unrecognisable from their original forms. My expectations were expectedly low. I could not have been more wrong. Chef K7(Kesavan) whips up culinary brilliance that appeals to both the western palette as well as hardcore south Indians such as myself. Even my pal(who I was there with) who resolutely denies any food that has less than 100kg of red chillies in it enjoyed the food so much that we were promptly back a few weeks later. And again. And again. Here's what the have - a chilli meter from 1 to 10, which is leaderboard of sorts, with bragging rights for anything above 7. But 6 is as high as you can go on your first visit - if you can clear that, you'll be invited on a full moon night to try the next level. Its an obvious marketing ploy but its also genius because you just want to want to do it. Did I mention the staff are super friendly and make you feel like you're dining at their house? That might have something to do with me going back too. All in all, this has become one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore very quickly.
5
I found this place through a family recommendation (and a dare to have the hottest level 6!), am I glad I listened!This has to be the tastiest curry I've ever eaten, and I've eaten a lot all over the world. When travelling from the UK to Australia I will now always try to route via Singapore with enough of a layover to get to this place - it's THAT good. I'm looking forward to my next trip - hopefully I can time it right to get a fabled Level 7..
5
I recently went to Lagnaa during a 1 week stay in Singapore and it was the best night of the holiday! Gorgeous food and brilliant atmosphere - the head chef even came and joined our party for a post dinner beverage! Highly recommend to anyone in Singapore
4
As someone who normally will not eat curry,I had a delightful meal. Our hostess was able to advise me of the best choice for my palate. The yoghurt rice made the meal incredible. It was interesting to note how they catered for novices like myself (1 in level of heat) whilst others were eating food at level 
1
Highly priced and not Indian taste. Owner Chef thinks he can cook but curries were prepared with just Chilli powder. All curries taste the same. Waste of money. Don't even try if you want Indian food.
5
Went here and sat on the floor upstairs, the service was sensational and they made an effort to understand our preferences.
The food was one of if not the best Indian I've ever had and the experience itself complimented the food...
4
Fantastic restourant, the chiken Tandori is super! Better then in India:). Clean and nice place in the middle of little India, I suggest you to book the table because is always full
5
The location, kind hosts as well as the tasty food make Lagnaa a Singapore favourite. The cranberry naan is a real treat!
5
My husband and I had a wonderful evening here... Great hosts and fab food... Sitting on the cool floor on a hot balmy night was v relaxing!

Friendly staff, amazing food! Portions are not very big but enough if you have a starter followed by a main!
Definitely an authentic experience! 👍🏻👍🏻

My wife and I had arrived after a 12 hour flight from London . We were not sure whether the breakfast we had eaten on the plane- served in a foil container with cardboard lid- had really been our supper.Singapore was humid and busy. But, after a bath, appetite returned and acting on Trip Advice, we made our way to the Lagnaa. I walked past without noticing it, but my wife is a better scout and spotted the board over the entrance. The choice was to sit at one of half a dozen narrow tables on either side of an aisle wide enough for the waitress to come and go from the mysterious interior , or else climb a steep flight of narrow stairs to an upper place where you can lounge on cushions and rugs while you eat if you prefer. Feeling tired, we opted for the former.The waitress was friendly and helpfully guided us through the menu.The strength of sauces is explained on a helpful chart on the wall. At the bottom was mild- anyone can. Then hoy still anyone can. Then hotter still- the chef can't. It went up a further four ranks to be so hot if you can eat the meal without a Raita you may be awarded it free. There are a dozen apparel wires hung with monograph end cloths-pegs to record past customers' attainment.. And the wall is tattooed with the appreciative legends of many more. We nibbled popadoms and drank Bullit 7 per cent proof Bangalore beer whilst we chose our starter- Pakora with green coriander freshly fried with a delicious mint sauce.Then Threadfin fish curry with yoghurt rice and Bhindi-and for pudding we shared a mango and cardomon ice cream- and I drank a gingered cardomon coffee.It was lovely.The fish was so fresh it melted in the mouth.The sauces were made to linger over to decipher their subtle blends of fresh herbs, peppery sweet, sour and bitter flavours.Memorable. The affable bespectacled moustachioed owner came out to ask us how we found the fish.There followed a conversation on the merits of sea fish over those of the river-in this part of the word we were told the latter tend to "muddiness" .We promised-perfectly sincerely- to tell our friend about the Barefoot diner , and left satisfied . Judged by its own standards of modesty it could not be faulted. 5 stars
5
We visited Lagnaa Indian restaurant barefoot dining experience and what a wonderful experience it was. You can either eat at the tables downstairs or sit on the floor upstairs in bare feet. The food was brilliant. There is a diverse collection of Indian dishes which the staff discuss with you and the strength of the flavours are matched to your individual needs.The restaurant prides itself on high quality food with exquisite flavours and also likes to test customers ability to see what strength of curry they can eat,ranging from 1 being mild and 6 really testing your palate.This is a little gem hidden away in Little India. A must if you're in Singapore
3
Visit Lagnaa for lunch with friend.This restaurant provide many kinds of indian food. For example Naan they provide about 10 kinds.Most of food in menu shows photo and explanation by English and Japanese, Korean...So you can choose dishes even you don't know Indian food.Most of customers are not Indian, looks like tourist.May be price is bit high.Interior is very casual.They have celling fan under light so every time blinking it cause me stress.Food is average service is good.You can request spicy level.Recommend for groups to share many kinds of foods

My husband and I had dinner there on his 40th Birthday just last week. We had Mutton Curry, and Buttered Chicken, Samosa and Naan bread. The Mutton Curry is very good. My husband love spicy food so he order 3.0 Very spicy ;-) We Love to eat mostly Indian food so this place didn't disappoint us. The price is a little bit expensive compare to other Indian restaurant in Little India. But the food is great! It just hurt my Butt sitting on the floor. ;-
5
A delicious and typical cuisine !
10 level of spices, you have to pick yours
Starting 3, your name will be placed on the Hall of fame
Starting 7 your meal is for free
From curry, to naans, to lassi, all is delicious !
5
All the food was great and you can customise it to your spicy level. Great people, always taking care if we needed anything.
Very recommended!
5
Since we didnt reserve a table we just sat outside which was nice. The main chef of the restaurant was off that day and he was sitting next to us at a table and tried new dishes. He explained all the dishes to us and recommended things and also told us which currys would fit with which naan and which rice. He also told us a lot about the indian kitchen. It was soo interesting and the food was amazing! He also recommended the carrot dessert (I forgot the name) which was amazing!!It is a bit pricey, but everything in Singapore is! So just go there and enjoy :
5
I am not big fun of Indian food but I found that I can enjoy it a lot. That food was delicios. I tasted also from girlfriend and despite it was too hot for me I loved it too.Do not expect luxury, the place has casual easy going atmosphere. You should call and book The stuff is friendly, means they really behaves like friends: give you advice on the food, chat and lough with you, make you feel free and easy. Cooke came to ask our impression.I think we met people who love their job. Thank you for this and for taste of India in Singapor
2
Value for money really low.considering the quantity (it was the first time i woke up hungry after an indian dinner) and quality (the food was not so warm and not so good to justify such prices).We took an appertise that in any real indian restaurant they gave for free a mix plate of fish and meat, water and coffee for 100 dollars...never any more
5
We stumbled across this place and ended up with a very tasty lunch! Friendly staff and a variety of dishes on the menu. We had a few small dishes with bread to try different things and it was excellent value. Barefoot dining area upstairs is only open for dinner
5
We got to this place on the basis of great reviews here, and it's fantastic. We got perfect service and advice what food to eat as we have our own way. (No chilli and no seafood.) we both got a super delicious meal. Tried the butter chicken and murg dil khush. Drunk ice masala tea and sukku coffee. Yummy!!!! Great team! Perfectly cooked chicken. Indian spirit.

While the barefoot dining concept is exciting I don't see the hype about this place. The curries were average. I love spicy food but was advised by the waitress not to exceed spice level 2 so I ordered level 2. Was disappointed with its spiciness as it wasn't as spicy as expected. Pricing was a little on the high end for what it is. When I went to pay the bill they tried to be sneaky by putting a charge for the "complementary" papadums they provided when I sat down at my table initially. She removed the charge when I explained they should be free if I didn't order them but slipping such a charge in your bill is just sneaky and wrong
3
We had a dinner at the restaurant, food was good but almost no spice so for an Indian restaurant, it does not make any sense to me. For information, I live in little india and I lived for a couple of months in India so I do know what I am talking about. Then we got 2 plates each for 4 persons $35 per person, while we were only 7 and that was not enough. Honestly don't waste your money there as many restaurant will provide the same level of service and delicious Indian food for not the half of the price. I am wondering how reliable Tripadvisor is at some point. Very disappointe
5
Great small restaurant with two floor in The Middle of Little India. If you want to enjoy the Air Con, you will sit on the floor at second level, if not stay at first floor to feel the life of the restaurant and sit on a chair. Do not play rising the levels of chili (level 1.5-2 is good enough for a trained mouth). Love the chicken butter, mutton masala and masala tea! To cool down try the knock out beer
5
We love everything about this place! We bring friends and family all the time because of the great atmosphere. Congrats on The Bib Gourmand Rating!!!!
5
Food was great but the atmosphere and friendliness of the owner was even greater!! Wonderful evening in the quaint downstairs part of the restaurant.
4
A great fun night ... where food becomes your foe for a while! In the end though, an armistice is declared and the spoils go to the peg winning victor. Recommend.
5
I was recently asked to accompany a friend to one of lagnaa's tasting evenings where they pick which dishes to have as their specials. I turned up with no expectations and left blown away by the food, service and the overall great experience. Ten dishes tasted, all exquisite. With each came great explanations of how the dish was created.... I learnt so much in a fun and tasty way. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. No wonder Michelin just gave them recognition.
5
A must visit when in Little India/ Singapore. A sample of chicken with a strength of 1.5 is served to allow you to determine the strength of curry that would best suit your pallet. Staff are informative, attentive and very friendly. Book to avoid being disappointed.
5
A good food experience is not just about the food, or the ambience or the incredibly charming staff, it's a perfect balance of all three - and at Lagnaa this is exactly what you get! The food is gloriously delicious and the staff treat you so well and make you feel at home in their really cozy set up! Tables downstairs and siting on cushions on the floor upstairs which is a super fun experience! I love it!
3
The novelty factor(being the level of spice in each dish) of the place seems to justify exorbitant pricing on its menu for small portions. A small stuffed naan and a lassi is almost double of what other good Indian restaurants would charge. Our mutton curry came with 2 prices of mutton... Disappointing
1
It was a nightmare! The chilly chicken can well be termed as tomato sauce chicken. The chicken tikka masala was nothing but chilly paste with just 4 pieces of boiled chicken. Lastly the chef's special was a chilly paste chicken fish and few potatoes!!! The portions they serve seems like they think the customers are below 6 years. Period

I've been meaning to write this review for awhile now. I'm just amazed this place made the #1 spot on Tripadvisors when there are so, so many other great places. But alas, I shall put in my 2 cents. This place offers good food but definitely not worth the price on their menu. The dishes came in tiny serving bowls (imagine Super Bowl veggies tray with the dip bowl in the center). Upstairs seating means you sit on the floor. I saw some seating on the first floor but it's not a/c'd. This is the first Indian restaurant I ate at after arriving in Singapore, and have since eaten at least ten others since. If I had to rate all the Indian restaurants I've eaten at, Lagnaa has to be pretty close to the bottom of the list. Don't get me wrong, if you are not accustomed to eating at "local" establishments, then this place is great for you. The staff is nice and will walk you through the menu suggesting what works together and what doesn't. The place has nice ambience and is clean. So you are paying for the extras and the service. You will not get this kind of time/service from more adventurous eating options. But if you know what you want and don't mind rubbing shoulders with the locals, then there are plenty of other places to get your Indian food fix. Just my opinion
3
The place was nice but I was wondering how we could fit 5 people's food on top of 1 small low table. Turned out everything was brought on 1 single plate....the portion was soooo small...for the price, I was so dissapointed. Food was good but in a normal indian restaurant, we would have several bowls with lot of food. Anyway, I got the "barefoot" experience but would not return
5
We sat in the downstairs part, which is very down to earth. However, don't let it fool you - the food is amazing. The upstairs sitting part looked nice but was closed for cleaning.
5
Delicious food and we were very well looked after
Advised on the dishes and what to order according to our tastes
3
Very nice place, lot of authentic indian food, as well restaurant stuff! Recommend chicken curry, so delicious! In the middle of little India!
5
We visited this place by chance! We were pleasantly greeted when approaching the restaurant to read the menu by a lovely lady.... my husband was after a vidaloo and he asked could 1 b made as it wasnt on the menu. She assured us they could! The service was amazing and the food was the best indian i have eaten (i have been to india). If we get time on our stay we will b back
5
We found the restaurant by walking through "Little india"!I can fully and truly recommend the restaurant, extremely good service and delicous food! Not only is the food delicious the quality of the ingredients are prime and the the awareness of how spicy you want your fod is impeccable as they follow the "scoville scale" , medium spicy is probably 1-1,5 on the scale!The restaurant is small but having a great ambiance due to the staff.All of you who come to Singapore and crave for Indian, it is worth coming to Little India for this restaurant!Ann Charlott
4
We chose this restaurant after a passing it on our tour. We had just finished a 3 hour walking tour of Little India and the thought of barefoot dining upstairs in the cool was just too tempting. Getting down on the floor was a little challenging for me with my arthritic aches and pains but with shoes off and a cool cocktail all was forgotten. The staff were very attentive and explained all the various meals and most importantly the heat levels of the spices and curries. We shared our dishes and they were tasty and flavoursome albeit on the small side for the price but it was ample for lunch
3
Nothing special about this place except for the fact if you want to show off your chilly eating expertise as per their wall mural. Indian food is not about its chilly spicyness but a fine balance of spices. Portions are very small for what you pay, so be prepared to order more. I sincerely dont understand how this establishment has won an award for its food when there are so many better more aunthentic indian restaurants in Little India Singapore. That was unfortunately going to be my last visit to Lagnaa. Much better choices out there in very corner around you
5
Little skeptical about this place when I walked in there were only foreigners in the restaurant, which normally means that it's not going to be authentic or tasty. BUT I WAS WRONG! This place is delicious! We ordered the butter chicken and palak paneer with 2 naans, 2 lassis. And everything was delicious! The service is by far better than any other service you get in Singapore.
4
Been there quite some time back probably months back . Don't remember. Anyway, food was great. Did not order much as my girlfriend is not a big water and the table wasn't that big. Staff was very friendly upon taking our orders , as I was new to Indian cuisine , the staff recommended some of the dishes and we followed on.Overall had a good experience and most probably would be back for more next time and definitely with larger parties so that we can try more varieties. Price came out slightly to the pricey side but it's not too bad
4
Visiting Lagnaa was certainly a good experience! We started by taking a taxi from our hotel close to Chinatown and arrived at a relatively anonymous restaurant. The whole experience, however, was everything but that. We were greeted by their friendly owner who guided us to the nearest table. We hadn't reserved a table, thus we're placed outside on the sidewalk at a small two-person table, which was fine with us, since the atmosphere was great and still felt like a part of the restaurant. After that, we were guided through the menu; recommendations, spice levels, etc. We ordered a mango lassi and a soda water. I really tried not to drink the whole lassi at once, because it was so delicious! Since we weren't that hungry, we just ordered the butterchicken and chicken in cream and coconutmilk with a side of white basmati rice and cranberry naan bread.It all arrived really quickly, and was super delicious. After that we had nice and long talk with their owner before we took a stroll on the streets of Little India.Nandri for the great experience.Best regards from Denmark

Lovelystaff, great food but don't get lulledinto ordering all their suggesstions. It's a lot of food and unnecessary.
5
Had a lovely dinner meal here with a friend. Good portion size and very tasty food. Poppadoms $1 on arrival. Right in the middle of Little India. Would recommend to others for sure!
4
I visited with my wife and teenage children. We loved the butter chicken, chick pea curry, mango lassi and the very attentive, friendly service.
4
Food was excellent. But, it was a little pricey. We had a good quantity mixed grill, chutneys with some type of cracker, two different curries, two deserts, and 3 large kingfisher beers. It came to $208 Singapore dollars.
1
Went with some friends based on reviews in a well known travel guide (initials L P). Had trouble finding the place but unfortunately we did.Were sent upstairs to find a table and then the waitress came up and tried to move us to a table in the corner next to a fire extinguisher.Food was dull and portions were small and over priced. The chilli rating is a gimic rather than anything to do with the food.In 9 days in Singapore this was the worst meal we had after trying everything from local hawker markets to a range of restaurants. There are better options in Little India with better atmosphere
5
Went here with couple of friends and was pleasantly surprised to find Old Monk Beer and good food.They have marked path to hotel with foot print stickers on road which are neat.Had best time and food was good too. May be more suitable for Couples
5
Excellent menu choice which was explained clearly to us - though we stuck to a spice level 3 as that was hot enough! Food was excellent - the chilli chicken was hot but didn't overpower the tomato sauce, and the vegetable pakora delicious. We also had the butter chicken, kourma, and a chicken in cashew nut sauce which I can't remember the name of. A fantastic meal and would recommend this restaurant highly
5
Went here after reading reviews so thanks previous reviewers. Had a Korma just to play safe and it was fantastic together with the the rice and peshwari naan. Afterwards i had a bowl of fennel seeds given to me and it was great that the chef took time to explain the benefits of a small teaspoon of the seeds to aid digestion. He also explained the different types of curry. Great experience, thank
5
Always nice to come back and see the Front of House serving you the Dishes and knowing our needs inside out. Of course not forgeeting to have a Lime Lassi in a warm afternoon during lunchtime! A fabulous place to hold your 1-on-1 meetings over drinks among the variety of Hot Masala Tea, Hot Indian Green Tea or a Cold Glass of Lassi. Now they have a jug of Lassi (which is equivalent to 4 glasses
4
Barefoot dining begins on the upper floor. Choose from different levels of spiciness and if you can finish the top few levels, you get it free! They had a wall of fame plastered on the side and it was a great experience. Friendly non intrusive service
4
this place is quite expensive at the first place, the food is ok, not exceptionally good, I do believe you can have equal quality food nearby with half of the price.
the boss is nice too, she likes to talk around the customers
4
Hot hot hot, go for a six'er. It will challenge you and your internal organs. Most importantly it's such a warm feeling not just cause of the curry but also the waiters and Chef. Hats of for a great and fun evening. Thanks chef

Indian food to die for.
An unprepossessing venue presents remarkable food, subtle, richly flavoured and utterly palate delighting.

Lagnaa is a small restaurant located in little Indian. If I had to select the best indian restaurant in Singapore I would choose Lagnaa. The food is fine, very tasty and cooked at the perfection. All along the meal, you will travel through different flavours and tastes. Moreover, the owners are very friendly and have always the smile. A must try absolutely

Had a really nice experience. The barefoot dining experience brings a really relaxed feel about the place. The staff are really friendly and take the time to talk you through their menu and are generally warm and friendly. They have the heat scale on some curries so it's worth while getting the chicken starter which is set to 1.5 on the scale of 6 and helps to calibrate your spice level. I had the lamb marsala at level 3. 3 is hot (but enjoyable if you like spice). It was just about the limit for me and I like hot curries. If you like spicy but not too spicy then go for 2 max. I think I could have 'taken' 4 but a whole curry might have become uncomfortable. The food itself was very nice and good quality. The flavours tended to be a smokey sort of flavour and was hoping for something a bit more sharp to give it a lift. That's my only criticism of the food. The starter was really really good (the chicken thing). I'd have that as a main. The prices are fair. About 15-20 for a curry. A beer is 9. Wine is about 13 I think. I'll definitely come back and I'm interested to try some of the vegetables and other curries.

A friendly little restaurant with great Indian food. If you are into spice and heat then this is the place to put your taste buds to the test of what heat you rally can take (that said they do equally cater for all tastes from mild to hot, hot, hot!). This is the second visit and it won't be the last!
5
Visited this restaurant because it had good reviews in our travel guide and it lived up to the review. From the outside it does't look like much more than a small cafe. However, the food and service received was amazing. The owner explained the menu to us, as they have different spice levels. The food was simply delicious. One of our party is a vegetarian and he could not believe how delicious his food was. The owner was very good at informing us that vegetable curries are hotter as they do not absorb the spices. Amazing experience and would love to go again
5
Decided to visit this restaurant based on Trip Advisor reviews and we weren't disappointed. We received a very friendly welcome from the owner who advised us on the different strengths of curry available (1 - 6) and menu choices. We chose 1.5 for the mutton curry which was more than enough. The korma was nothing like those served in England. The food was lovely and the kitchen, which we could see from our table looked clean and organised.One wall of the restaurant is tiled and previous diners have written on it, commenting on how hot a curry they have managed - very amusing. The restaurant also run curry cooking classes but we were not in Singapore long enough to partake.

Had to sit out the front as the indoor area was full. Had some starter which wasn't very good followed by a couple of very disappointing curries. Get better from any food court for a fraction of the price. The middle aged female server was overbearingly pushy too, constantly trying to tediously upsell food every single time they came over. It gets very tiring having to tell them for the sixth time we don't want anything else. I don't think the Banana Leaf around the corner is amazing, but it is miles better than this place. Genuinely clueless how such mediocre food can be so highly rated on here. I can only surmise that the reviewers must never have had decent Indian food.
5
Felt very welcome the moment we arrived and appreciated the advice re the curry heat rating! The threadfin fish curry was delicious and the chicken korma excellent also. Great with a beer or three, and when they found out it was my wife's birthday we even got a free dessert and candle! Highly recommended for a great casual meal and has a great Lttle India street vibe too..
5
Food is amazing, the experience is fun, although does get a little uncomfortable after a while sitting on the floor. Still love the concept and experience, worth a visit!
5
Great food and very helpful staff. Some of us like hot food and others not so they catered very well for all us. Very enjoyable venue but we were lucky to get a table as we had not booked.
5
great food, lovely staff. Next time we'd love to try the upstairs area (with AC), but really enjoyed being near the kitchen, and our son loved being invited to help cook his own naan bread.
5
We came again to the Lagnaa and were not disappointed, again great Indian food!Try the special dishes of the month, uniquely created for this month. The Naan with Cranberries is also great in combination with one of the curries.If you would like to dine upstairs take some additional clothing with you – it is really cold! And be aware that you have to take off the shoes (….bare foot dining)
4
Came with work colleagues Enjoyed the meal - they have a curry heat scale where you choose how hot you wish to go.. I did 5 and it was HOT! I think only 1 person has done 9! The staff/owners are wonderful - came and chatted for ages about curry and spices. Recommend
5
I would not have noticed the place if not recommended by my friend...well hidden well along Upper Dickson Road...1.5 spicy level chicken feels nothing...ordered level 4 koli curry leaf chicken..first few mouthful feels nothing...now my stomach is still burning (wed night till now)...will i be able to take any higher level spiciness?? I wonder...but i must say the Dhal Makhni is super, many other things on the menu unexplored...i will be back to try barefoot dining on 2nd storeyzz
5
This has got to be one of the best restaurants that I have ever visited. The food is amazing, and the menu is shaken up regularly, helped by the master chef challenging the kitchen to come up with new tastes.I went there to have a dining experience and left feeling I had made new friends. The staff are so nice and friendly, and really make an effort to stay and chat with you. There is also, of course, the chilli challenge, but this is not the only attraction as I mentioned previously.I visit regularly both alone and with my family and can't recommend it enough
5
The atmosphere is pretty nice. People there take great care of you and help you with everything you need. The chicken tikka masala is amazing especially Level 4 and 5 on the spice ladder. The banana lassi is also amazing! Definitely a must go restaurant when visiting Little India. Be sure to make a reservation
1
Having eaten indian food all over the world for many years this was probably the least pleasant experience. To start with it took long before they would take our order and we had to ask for the food menu. Tap water is apparently self service so one has to walk into their kitchen to get a glass and fill it from a dirty tank. First after 25 min the food arrived and it unfortunately did nothing to improve our bad impression of the restaurant. We had asked for level 2 spiciness for both the mutton curry and the butter chicken but the mutton curry did not taste anything but chili and the butter chicken wasn't spicy at all.. In addition the curries were tasteless, too fatty and the raita felt like eating heavy cream. This restaurant seems very hyped up as it's full of people despite the terrible service and less than average food. Also, the owner or manager was quite yaya-papaya. Not recommended
5
We met K7 (Kaesavarn) one hot Singapore afternoon. He is the front man of this terrific authentic Indian restaurant. He is affable and knowledgeable both about his cuisine and also Singapore. We had the set meal with an additional "hot" curry. As restaurateurs ourselves we recognize fresh ingredients and food that has been prepared in loving and thoughtful manner. The chilli scale on the wall is a good laugh, and and the lassis in jugs were both very refreshing and effective in curtailing the chillies' rage. The food here is authentic and fresh. The vibe funky and fun. A really good dining choice. We will be back
5
Being a fan of Mangos, the Mango Lassi tasted great! Worthwhile to have this drink in this hot month in Singapore!
5
Thanks to Shanti and the team at Lagnaa for a great evening. The food was delicious, the ambiance relaxed and welcoming, the organization extremely efficient and easy.
Its Indian food with a difference and highly recommendable!

Prepare to be upsold by the charismatic owner at this cosy joint in little India. The fish curry and variety of unusual naans are worth trying. The owner will happily match bread and rice to your chosen curry and spice level. Not cheap, but that's Singapore. Would visit again.

Based on good reviews, my husband and I decided to visit and booked to sit upstairs. The service was very good, with pleasent staff and efficient service. When ordering, the lady kindly explained that you get to choose your spice level. She explained the spice level numbers and helped us decide which was best for us.The food arrived quite quickly and was very tasty. Nice presentation and very enjoyable, however the portion sizes were on the small side. The experience of sitting on the floor is a nice experience for people to try, however, I was a little disappointed with the decor upstairs. Apart from the floor tables and cushions, the room was pretty bare. There were various walls which could have been used to hang things etc. Personally, we would have liked the decor and ambiance to have felt more authentic. Overall, very nice food and good service.
4
Visited Lagnaa at the (insistent) recommendation of my son who visited last year with my wife on a visit to Singapore. The host was delighted to hear that their reputation had spread as far as Scotland where we are from and took me up to the barefoot (well, sock-foot for me) dining area upstairs. I choose coconut rice from the Tamil new year menu along with mutton masala which is one of their signature dishes. The food was excellent and totally lived up to my family's account. The service was a little tardy, but with a large Kingfisher to keep me company I scarcely noticed
2
We were really disappointed with our experience. We were a group of five that had reserved a table. We arrived to a table of four even though the reservation card on the table said five people. It took some time for this to be sorted and we had to wait for another table to finish their meal. The service was very poor this night. It took 30 minutes for a can of beer. It was over 1 hour before we got our meal. We were told they were one waitperson down but we really don't think this would have helped, it was just too busy for the number of staff and we did have the set menu so that should have been quicker. We have eaten a lot of Indian around the world, the food was okay, it is authentic but we expected a lot more based on the reviews and the fact it cost us $350 for five people. Very expensive Indian that did not live up to the reviews. We have had a lot better meals in Singapore
5
This restaurant was the best curry I have ever had. Only downside was that they would not let me order the set meal (which is the only way to get a good price at the restaurant) because it was just me and not two people. I understand, but I only went because the original waitress told me it was okay to order it anyway. But overall, a great meal. My mouth was on fire. I loved it.
5
If you love spicy food and would like to challenge yourself, this is THE place to go! From level 1(not hot)-10(the king), Very original and tasty Indian food. The lady we spoke to is very helpful in terms of ordering, she also shared with us a lot of info regarding how the food is prepared and stories in this restaurant, very nice! If you don't like spicy food, you can go with the level 1 without any problem. Though a little bit expensive but recommend!
5
Friendly greeting... Delicious fresh lime juice arrived promptly. We were well advised on spice level (I think it was a 2, just enough to clear the sinuses but not over the pain threshold), complementarity and quantity of dishes, and those arrived quickly too. Lagnaa's decor looks like a Lonely Planet magnet, but don't let that put you off. Nice folks, not your cookie-cutter mass-produced menu, and a great place to spend an evening. You should arrive hungrier than we did to take full advantage. Dinner for two was around $60 with two beers; you could certainly eat for much less in the neighbourhood but we think Lagnaa was worth it
5
Went there with friends as a friend of mine won a "make your own dhosa" class. It was real fun! We were given dough and pans and learnt how to make our own dhosas. Staff was extremely friendly and recommended dishes we could have with our dhosas. Everything was awesome, we had tons of veggies and the fish curry. Really enjoyed and will definitely go back for the barefoot experience upstairs!

Great place Amazing venue people and food I had vegetarian options but was great quality and very tasty the people who worked 👍
5
Great healthy food and very friendly staff which is a rare thing in the service industry in Singapore.
4
Food was fantastic. I had the vegetable korma with a toto. Service was really good. The owner could have been friendlier.
5
Quirky little eatery in a busy sidestreet. The owner K7 is friendly and helpful. Karsavan speaks english well and even understands Aussie ☺ made sure my food was gluten free and amazing.

We went with our two children and were met once in little India by lots of men holding hands - where are we we thought !Anyway we arrived at the restaurant and we slightly underwhelmed at the establishment. However, we took our shoes and popped upstairs to a very basic but clean eating area. We were greeted by a very polite and quite waiter ( who did have a little BO problem ) but he was nice and took our drinks order. We actually had to go get our own water from a brown cooler through a door labelled Pantry.The manager ( I presume ) then came to take our order. As a regular curry eater I was all for a number 3 strength on the spice scale but I was advised not go go above 1.5. I took his advice and was pleasantly surprised, he was right !The food was very good, the service was also very good and all in all ( except the waiters BO ) we had a lovely experience.If you want an authentic Indian night out then Little India is for you - be aware, it's not quite Scotts Road but we did feel we had actually been to India
5
We arrived early, before the evening rush and chatted for a while with the owner. He was happy to share his passion for food; share recipes; share cooking techniques ( see Facebook videos on tempering)The food was wonderful. I had a mild, flavoursome fish curry with yogurt rice. My dining companion had a Level 4 mutton curry which earned him the right to add a peg to the Peg String of Honour . . The peshwari naan bread was the best I've ever had the pleasure of tastingSurroundings were cosy, comfortable and relaxed. it is a cNeeded shop-house opening on to the street. We sat downstairs and watched the world passing
5
The Butter chicken was delicious, it went well with the jeera rice. I like the idea that they offered degrees of spiciness for various dishes. Shanti who welcomed us and took our order remembered my friend who visited the restaurant more than a year ago. I will definitely go there as I live in Singapore
5
A place to go when you are in Singapore. In Little India you will find this cozy nice restaurant, the best Indian Restaurant I have ever been. The food is brilliant, the different flavors are tasty. Compare it with other Indian restaurants. Upstairs you get seated on the floor and that makes also the difference. Multiple tasty dishes and a choice out of several spice levels will result into another experience of Indian Food (level 2 out of 6 is already spicy). Rely on the recommendation of the boss, she will be helpful (as all other staff members)
5
We have read the varied reviews of this place and the main issue people seem to have is that it is overpriced /tourist prices. Well it is more expensive than a lot restaurants around it, however the prices are very clearly stated on the menu so you can choose to depart at that point.Upstairs is the area where you can sit on cushions bare foot. We chose to eat in the cafe area downstairs. We were promptly seated and handed menus. We were given information about the dishes. When something ie poppadoms were suggested it was made clear that there was a cost. You can opt for the spiciness of your dish. Level 1-10. If you eat a level 3 or higher you can add your name on the wall. No one has finished a level 10. I am a bit wimpy so I had korma. DH opted for a rogan josh . He initially went for level 4 but after talking to the manager decided to err on the side of caution and opted for level 3. The food was really really nice. The Manager checked up on us a few times and was very good humoured. She took a photo of the pegging ceremony too and sent it to us the same day. The main thing to note about the dishes were that they were made to the spice level. The spiciness was blended into the flavour of the dishes as opposed to tasting like lots of chillies had just been added afterwards. We really enjoyed our dinner and left very satisfied
4
A very authentic restaurant in a side street in Little India. Very friendly staff and the food was spot on. If you like tasty and spicey then this place is for you. It caters for all levels of chilli bravery too. It would have been a five star rating but for the fact it was a little on the pricey side. We all walked away feeling very satisfied after the good food and soaking up the atmosphere.
5
A quirky place in a side street. It would be a shame to walk past as you will be missing out on the complex tastes of their curries. Hands down the best curry I have eaten to date!
5
You won't go wrong if you choose this place; A hearty welcome, great service and a yummy taste experience awaits. From 'mild to blow your socks off scale' will help choose your spice level.
5
Had a great time, great ambiance and the food was great. It is a great place to bring friends and family. People working there was very thoughtful and nice! Worth a visit.
3
Overrated. Food is an good attempt to North Indian Cuisine, reduce spice component. Good service. Must add more dense cushion for comfort floor sitting.
5
Being a somewhat 'regular' at Lagnaa, myself and a friend attended the Monthly Food Tasting' evening where we were served ten fantastic dishes with the difficult decision of selecting the best three which will form the April 'Specials'. As always, the atmosphere was warm and family orientated with the owners treating us like old friends rather than customers. A fabulous night was had by all with special care and attention being given to all the dishes we were served. I have no hesitation in recommending Lagnaa to anyone who wants a quality dining experience in a friendly and caring atmosphere
2
Visited this restaurant based on tripadvisor rating: I expected something exceptional but was disappointed. the food was of good quality but not something that special that I would go back for. The prices are quite expensive compared to others but what bothered me most is the size of the portions. If you are hungry, ordering a main dish will likely not be enough. I had an ice cream for 7 Dollars that was extremely small, about one scoop. Really more of a tourist trap
3
We ate our way around Singapore on our recent visit - mostly visiting hawker markets and were really impressed by the quality and flavours. We were looking forward to going to Lagnaa based on the reviews - however were left a bit disappointed. It was our least enjoyable meal and most expensive of our stay. The food was ok, but not great, and not as good as a lot of the cheaper meals we had had. The paneer palak (or saag, can't remember exactly what it was called but spinach and cheese curry) was particularly bland (saag is one of my favourite curries typically so this isn't because I just wasn't a fan of that type of curry). A chicken curry we had was great and packed with flavour, but the rest of the meal was a disappointment. The staff were friendly and informative
5
My sister lives in Singapore, so she introduced me to Lagnaa. It was the best curry I have ever tasted, good authentic Indian cooking. I'm not really into anything too spicy but the Lady who works there is very helpful in helping you choose something that will suit you, she even got me to try new dishes that I would not normally go for! I was not able to get a peg on the wall (you can get one with your name on if you eat a curry hotter than a 3/10) but the experience was still amazing. I will definitely be returning on my next trip in a weeks time
5
Having lived in Singapore for some time, this is certainly the best curry I have come across. It might be a bit more expensive than other places (e.g. Banana Leaf Apollo), but the quality of food and service certainly make it worthwhile!Book in advance to get a place upstairs, where you can sit on the floor around a low table. The atmosphere is very cool!The service is second to none! Greeted by a lovely lady (so sorry I never took her name) who will run through the menu, the spice levels and make excellent recommendations.The food is very high quality â€“ from the meat right down to the bread. They have a great selection of dishes which you can cater to your preferred spice level.I first went here with colleagues after work. It was so good I have been back several times with parents and then my siblings who came to visit me in Singapore
5
Chef Keseven offers an original take on authentic Indian food. Lovely food, lovely friendly staff. You can control the level of 'heat' in the meal. Quirky atmosphere, menu makes you laugh. Generous ambience ever so slightly undermined by charging for poppadoms which are automatically supplied to the table. Staff now do tell you though
5
Amazing food, ambiance, and service. Indian dining at its finest. We tried the butter chicken and level 6 spicy chicken tikka masala. Got a few garlic naans on the side too. Fantastic experience you shouldn't pass on. Definitely coming back!
5
We ate here whilst in Singapore and it was one of the most delicious curry we have ever had. The staff were so friendly and welcoming and we would recommend level 7 of you like heat and spice, if not stick below 5!
5
Been here a few times and had fun each time. Can be a bit on the $$ side but good is tasty and service good.
5
Awesome meal last night here in Singapore and its my favorite food when I travel. Saw all the positive reviews on Trip Advisor so had to check it out. Kaesavan or K7 as some call him is the owner and he sat right across from me almost the entire meal. Educated me some more regarding Indian food! Super nice guy. Top notch Tikka masala and butter chicken. Had to have both! And, the cranberry nan rocks! Can wait to visit again next time I am here
4
We went 5 times to this restaurant. Maybe more commercial Indian food then authentic. The staff is very friendly and helpfull with the intensity of the flavour. We are scoring a 0 if it comes to taking the heat so we won't make it to the wall of fame. But who cares when you are staying with the Lagnaa restaurant.
5
Probably one of my best Indian restaurant experience in Singapore. Very very kind service by a lady helping you making the best choice in a very rich variety of food. Try the strong Tiger beer, excellent ! Wear comfortable clothing as no sitting at table well laying on the floor, even without shoes, which makes your culinary experience even more exotic!
3
Dining here was pleasant but not incredible. The waitress provided useful knowledge ons what dishes matched and everything.I think for food verse value my assumption that it is more upmarket and suited mainly suited to tourists as I noticed everyone the night we went either spoke French or English English.If you want a local authentic feel, I think heading over the main road to the big indoor market and try it with the locals
5
This place is brilliant! The food is really tasty and the owners are always happy to explain the menu or make suggestions. The curry spice levels are good fun (although above level 3 it's really quite spicy!). I visited once with my family and once solo and felt well looked after both times. I would recommend the mint lassi (delicious and haven't seen it anywhere else!) plus the koli leaf curry. I saw some reviewers have complained about portion sizes but for me it was the right amount. It was one of my more expensive meals in Singapore but I would recommend nonetheless. Sit upstairs if you can as it has a really nice vibe (you may need to book)
3
I must agree with other trip's fellow. This place is overpriced for what you get.You will not get sick from the food and this is the good part.The portions are small and the price is high.We were sitting on a table on the sidewalk with cars parked in front.At 50$/ pers. one can find a better place
1
we are not impressive with this place. Average food, above average price. tiny plate fish curry for s$21, small plate of butter chicken for s$15. it sounds like a price in 5 stars hotel chain with best food. But it is not. The owners said the room upstair was full. After 30 minutes eating there, none came downstairs. We assume the owners want people to eat downstairs on the street so the restaurant looks crowded. walk around, so many good restaurant with better taste and price around
5
We had a great lunch here. Five people split five dishes and everything was superb. Everything was rich, fragrant, and exactly as spicy as predicted when we took the order. The portions were big enough to satisfy without overdoing it.
4
A great start to spending time in Singapore. Friendly greeting, nice casual atmosphere good suggestions for menu choices and good value. What's not to like?
4
A great place to eat with delicious food and excellent service. Will be coming back here next trip to Singapore.
4
Not very familiar with Indian food but followed the advice for chili fish and yogurt rice, which is fantastic
Probably due to Trip Advisor and Lonely planet the place feels like a backpacker hangout thus only go if you're after authentic food and not atmosphere
4
Nice little restaurant located in Little India. Restaurant has two floors and upstairs no shoes allowed. That explains the name of the place. Restaurant has a sort of backpackers style of setting. It's a friendly laid back environment. Staff is very attentive to help you making a choice. English is well spoken by the staff. Food can be made mild or spicy. Price wise this restaurant is a bit on the higher side. Indian food can be had cheaper elsewhere. Quality of the dishes are good, however portions are rather small. My curry dish was basically served in a cappuccino mug. If you would have to share this dish with friends it's simply not enough. Overall: friendly staff, enjoyable setting. Good quality but small portions taking the price into consideration.
2
The Food was OK considering there is plenty of great food in Little India.. the price was ridiculously higher than the competition considering- the competition (for a 1/3 of the price you can eat the same dishes in the area, the desserts were way overpriced )- the location (too small, the tables outside are exposed to traffic, the floor upstairs where you can go barefoot is cramped)- the quantity (way too small)If you are upstairs service is spoardic.. better order everything right away as you will not see the waiters for a while
5
This area was disappointing but not at all this great restaurant ! We have been greeted with the kind smile of the chatting owners ! We went for lunch and they told us that for dinner we should have booked as it is always full and I believe as the food is great! For lunch you can choose between cheap menus or a la carte .The menu was plenty for us ,great yougurt rice and mild curries for us ,but you can have different levels of hotness .The cheek pea patties with veggies were the best ever and their sauces refreshing and tasty .Loved their breads and the mango lassi .Definetly a restaurant I would suggest 
2
We have been here many time, the standard has dropped over the years, and the price is getting higher. We had the $35/head set, but felt ripped off, the curry fish head is not cook and we had to send it back, they return with the same pot but the taste is off. 8 of us spent $443, would be better off ordering ala carte and get better value. Don't think we will go back again.
4
Lagnaa has a unique heat grading concept in Little India. You can choose the heat of your curry based on a scale from 1 to 10 (nobody has achieved 10, yet). 1 and 2 are mild and warm. Based on our experience there, my wife had a level 3 (somewhere between madras/vindaloo heat by UK standards) and I had a 4 (around a phall level of heat). The levels above this must be a serious challenge. However, the great thing was that even at a serious level of eat the curries were full of flavor. The use of multiple spices, including cinnamon, blended together skillfully by the owner/master chef produced such depth of flavor that the experience was extremely enjoyable. Add to this the novelty factor of getting to write your name on a peg and clip it to a heat-level denoted string on the wall for completing anything from level 3 upwards and the friendly banter from the owner and his wife and you have yourself a great eating experience in Little India. Yes, this is more for tourists than locals but it's good food and fun. Highly recommended
4
Greeted by the "Head Toe" (the owner) Kaesavan, we were seated and greeted with fanfare and humor. It is a really casual dining experience in Chinatown. We selected a combo platter to share (the middle one at about $28 SPD p/p. Excellent choice and great beer was Kingfisher. They have a star rating system for the hotness or spice level of the food. We like spice and wanted to go for 2 out of 5. The Big Toe suggested we go 1.5 and we were glad we did. Just perfect. Come and relax, there is no rush or fuss. Just hang out. Recommend this place as does Lonely Planet
4
Sat upstairs in shoeless eating region, sustenance was great and administration was mindful. Would prescribe to others. We had the chicken korma and the prawn masala too!
5
Fantastic food enjoyed by the whole family, with brilliant service. Will definitely go again when I am in singapore!
4
We stopped in for lunch and a beer. We sat up the top on the floor the music was nice and the service attentive. We had the okra with rice. It was a good meal and fairly mild. The mango lassi was nice too.
5
You just have to visit. The place is nestled in the heart of little India so you've got the aromas wafting around the place and making you hungry as soon as you step of the train. A work of caution though - when they say 'spicy' they mean spicy!!
5
I have visited this place multiple times, with it's large sample of different tastes, 1-10 spice challenge and authentic indian beers it couldn't get much better, then it did. The staff always offer a kind smile and conversation and invited me and friends back for a regular tasting session as part of their menu selection process. Great food, in the heart of little india.
5
We chose to enjoy an authentic experience and sit upstairs on the floor. At first, we were surprised by how small it is, and thought it lacked atmosphere, but it wasn't long before we were mixing with some of the other guests and had an enjoyable night. The food was fantastic, and we even enjoyed a bit of a chilli challenge! I only got to chilli rating 3, but my partner made it to 7! The chef mixed with the diners which added to the experience. Would return to enjoy great food in the heart of Little India
5
My husband and I went to Lagnaa for lunch on our 17th anniversary. It was wonderful. The food was delicious. The butter chicken was great and my husband tried the Level 3 Mutton Curry. I loved the concept of trying different heat levels and if you had Level 3-6 you got a peg that you signed and added to the wall of fame. I also loved that you could leave a message written on the wall. It was great reading all the messages from around the world. The staff were so lovely, they even gave us a free dessert for our anniversary, gave very useful tourist advise and took pictures of us that they emailed to us. They were beautiful people and the atmosphere was so welcoming. Perfect sized meals, well priced and super tasty. We will definitely recommend Lagnaa to friends and go back when next in Singapore. We might even try Level 4!!! Thanks Lagnaa for making our anniversary extra special xx Dee and Ja

Spices blended with the skill of an alchemist and the flair of an artist to create a unique depth of flavour combined with as much heat as you can handle. The heat grading system is a good guide and the owners are wonderfully hospitable. A great experience.

Mmm... This place came up on my tripadviser as being a well-rated nearby Indian place. Indeed the ambience of the restaurant was welcoming and warm; the friendliness of the staff cannot be faulted; and they gave helpful suggestions on accompanying dishes and drinks and seemed genuinely interested in whether we were enjoying our dining experience. Even the owner/chef came out for a chat which was a lovely touch. And the food was delicious and beautifully presented. However, it's certainly on the pricey side and they do charge for everything. No complimentary popadoms here. To be honest it was disappointing to later walk down the street and read the prices for similar meals in other restaurants that were often three times cheaper.Overall I enjoyed this dining experience. It's a good place. But would be better still with more competitive pricing
4
Went to this restaurant after reading review in Lonely Planet Guide. We were there on a Sunday which was interesting as Little India was bustling with indian workers on their only day off to shop etc. there were 100s of men standing around talking etc and we sighted only 3 women . We enjoyed our experience at the restaurant , the food was delicious but the serves tiny and very expensive . We felt strongly that they probably had a menu for obvious tourists and a different one for locals

Dining at lagnaa offers a great taste of what india has to offer. The food and service are excellent!
4
A nice restaurant in little India which is a bit different from the rest of Singapore. Good, strong food and extremely good service where the waiter guides you to the right combinations and strength of the dish accustomed to your taste.

Sat upstairs in bare foot dining area, food was good and service was attentive. Would recommend to others. We had the chicken korma and the prawn masala
5
The chicken Korma is outstanding, great choice of beer, good atmosphere and the best service we've ever had at any Indian restaurant. Highly recommended!
4
Had a very enjoyable dinner for two, nice authentic ambience, very tasty, great service, decent prices. I had their most popular fish curry, the garlic naan was delicious and i still dream of the mango lassi. Will return!
5
If you are looking for a relaxing atmosphere, friendly people, and delicious food then this is the place to go. It is right in the heart of little India and the very best Indian food I've ever had. It is definitely worth the visit.
5
This has to be one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Hidden away once you find it you'll definitely be back. The food is amazing and it is improved by the warm and friendly owners and fantastic service.

We wanted to post this review earlier but time passes . We booked Lagnaa on the back of TA reviews again and as ever this lovely resturant and the staff delivered a memorable dining experience for us as a family. Little India in Singapore was one of my favourite places , rough and ready but the people and food were great . The staff at Lagnaa are superb and attentive , we know our way around UK Indian food but this was different , delicate spicing and a different ' better' experience . Yes these guys do hot curries but they are full of flavour and taste. We opted for No 3 & 4 s which were on our edge but didn't compromise taste , a table next door ordered a ' special' No 7 due to it being the end of the month ! They cried and cried.... Happy I guess...our advice as a a family go and have a meal here , the food is great and the staff and owner make you feel special ...what more to say ...thank you Lagna

I was craving some "Indian" Indian food for a while before a friend referred me to this place. I've had Indian food in Singapore earlier but it just wasn't spicy enough for me. Being from Rajasthan in India, the spice levels I prefer might be considered moronic by some! But the moment I arrived at barefoot, the aroma of spices told me I was at the right place!! it is no mean feat finding the restaurant because it can easily be missed owing to its small size and other huge hoardings of bigger restaurants. But once there, the helpful nature of the staff just takes over. I took the famed chilli challenge and if u complete a stage, they let you put ur name up on the spice ladder! The best thing about the place is that unlike so many places which consider adding an insane amount of chilli to make a dish hot, while obviously losing out on the actual taste of the dish, the chef here knows that hot and spicy food is not just adding chilli. You need to strike a delicate balance of making the curry hot while retaining the flavours of the other ingredients. This was achieved to perfection and I can't wait to go back again and try the next level of chilli!

Stumbled across this restaurant with the family one evening, unremarkable from the outside, the interior is distinctive and fun.Not a cheap restaurant, though really only western prices. However i suspect they make good profit from alcohol as one beer i drank was double what i was paying for the same at a different restaurant only a couple of days before.The food ranged from solid (butter chicken) to brilliant (mutton masala), staff very good and service quick but not rushed.Would definitely return to try more dishes from the menu, but probably have a rest from the beers
5
If you want to eat Indian food in Singapore then stop reading this and go straight to Lagnaa. Now. You won't get better in Lion City or anywhere else. The owners are great too.
4
Food great
Seated near fire extinguisher with small kids which wasn't great
Needed to wait 15 min while they got our table ready even though we had called to book
Food delicious
5
Lagnaa serve great tasty Indian dishes! As well as that they have a great 'heat rating system'1 to 10. If you have a 3 or above you get a peg, put your name on it and pin it on a string line adjacent to your level of meal. The maximum you can have have on your first visit is a 6, or on any visit other than a full moon, which you have to book for. On a full moon your can have a meal with a heat level of 7, 8, 9 or 10; BUT only if you've achieved the previous level prior to this i.e. before you have a 7 you need to have achieved a 6, before you have an 8 you need to have had a 7 etc. only a handful of people have had an 8 and only one a 9. Great restaurant, great food, great concept, need to come back on a full moon as I've had a number of 6's
3
special barefoot dining experience, authentic indian curry, good spicy curry challenge concept. (they have 10 level of curry, those who pass the challenge can clamp their name on the wall. so far no one has passed level 10) we tried level 6, it's indeed quite spicy. the food was quite expensive. a single drink will cost you around $7. good service
4
The place is located in a shady street and there is no board with its name written. There are liquor bottles hanging outside.The food is amazing...the flavor and aroma of rice is amazing.There is a touch of south Indian flavors in the food.These people charge you for additional mint sauce, pappad etc.The place is quite shady and could get a makeover!
3
If you think Bali is all about Indonesia, and Edinburgh is Scotland, then this is the place for you.Also, you'll need deep pockets. We were stung for over $260 dollars for 6 of us today...I am still in shock, as I got a naan platter from my local hawker centre for $7 a couple of days ago, and that had some heat and flavour to it.This place caters for people who obviously think that pepperoni is spicy. The chilli challenge stuff on the walls is there for whom? We have better curries in Glasgow. There are much better places, and more authentic ones in the area.However, the Staff were great, but they must know that this is a tourist trap and once the threshold is crossed they have them!! It looks like a surfer bar, and has marketed itself very well to the tourist trade - so good luck to them. We will be back in Little India in the next week or so, and when my family leave for the UK, I will still head there for food, but not here
5
Went here for lunch and ordered a lunch set for two people (the middle one in terms of price). The food is fantastic - some of the best indian food i have eaten - and the staff is very polite and welcoming. Will be happy to come back again and try other dishes in the menu
2
I went to this Indian restaurant as suggested by trip advisor. The food was decent but not exceptional. Also they charged for items like chutney and papads which is complementary in most of the Indian restaurants though we never asked for it. On asking the cashier she told it was normal to be charged. The cheque was of decent amount as compared to the quantity of food we ordered. Never going back to this restaurant
5
Upon arrival the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The waiter sat down with me and took the time to explain the menu in detail even though the restaurant was busy. I ordered the mutton marsala and butter chicken. Both curries were beautifully spiced and the meat was incredibly tender. The butter chicken is a mildly spiced dish so I ramped up the mutton marsala to a chili level of 4. I love spicy food and found this to be quite hot so beware! The food was delicious...the best North Indian style curries I'd eaten in years
4
My wife and I dinned here, it was recommended by the hotel we were staying at (Wanderlust) and it is only a short walk from the hotel. I'd agree with another reviewer who said it's good Indian food for Europeans. I'd also add that the waiter who took our order was excellent. He was relaxed and easy going, and made us feel very comfortable. Great friendly service. The food was great, and our meal at this restaurant was the best meal we had in the 3 days we were in Singapore
5
Each time we go to Lagnaa we enjoys the time we spend over there.
The food is excellent and the service staff is so friendly. The Chef comes always to speak with us. I Love This Restaurant.
4
Restaurant is quite small but friendly service with an explanation of the 'chilli challenge' readily provided. Excellent lassis and makhni daal, whilst a level 4 chilli chicken was indeed spicey. Prices reasonable but not that cheap.
3
Nice food but not value for money. Beer too expensive for a street restaurant. Service is good and friendly staff
5
I was walking down the street and noticed the trip advisor logo. When I stopped, the owner and his wife invited me for tea as we discussed Indian cuisine. He was such an expert, and I was supposed so tempted to try the varying levels of heat, I decided to have an early dinner. I relish hot food and a number "6" was a challenge but I managed to finish it and proudly sign a clothes pin and add it to the wall of fame. I look forward to returning to Lagnaa during my next trip to Singapore for the wonderful food and conversation
5
Here you can try the best of the Indian cuisine with the touch for Europeans stomachs, the best is the location: in the heart of Little India (nice Singapore area) I recommend to go during weekends (Sunday is the day off for indians in Singapore so streets are plenty of people, you will think you are in Mumbai) The restaurant is quiet nice also and the staff very attentive, you can choose how spicy you want your plate.I recommend the butter chicken curry and korma chicken
5
We enjoyed an evening here with son and girlfriend who are SG residents and have eaten here before. The upstairs barefoot dining is a little quirky to us Europeans who do not normally sit on the floor to eat! It added to the experience although we shall not throw away our dining table and chairs at home. Service was exceptional, giving friendly and helpful guidance to us as we made our choices and continued throughout our meal. The food was very good and enjoyed by us all. We did all enjoy the desserts, especially my wife who chose the unique made to order option.
5
I visited midweek with a group of friends, all of whom had been before. We sat upstairs in the "barefoot area". You sit on the floor at low tables and it can a little while to get used to.Our dishes were at the lower end of the restaurant's 1 to 9 heat scale (we had 2s) but these already had enough heat to be interesting and tasty without being a firey struggle. Breads, rice and veg dishes were also very good.Owner/chef made time to come and chat with us - overall very welcoming atmosphere with fine food
5
A friend based in Singapore recommended this place. Downstairs opens up onto a side street sitting about 24 people - upstairs is barefoot dining - slightly larger. The owners have been there 10 years - for your starters they will recommend a few small dishes at varying 'hotness' - starting at 1.5 going up to 2 or more - this gives you a benchmark to order your mains. Try to sit downstairs - you may need to book - it's more fun watching the world go by - we had various dishes from 1.5 to 3.0. If you make it to 5.0 you get a peg - very few 9.0 and no 10.0
5
Very interesting spice level options, excellent customer service! It is indeed a combo to have for any customer....Tired level 6 and surprised that I survived the battle, looking forward to an enjoyable path to 10! sound ambitious but why not! Worth the visit, so stop reading more, start googling the place!
2
We sat out on the street sidewalk and put up with cars parked about 1 metre away so can't say I found the ambience to my liking. We were also asked to move to a table for 2 (granted there was only the 2 of us) but shortly after that, another couple arrived and were allowed to sit at the table we were asked to vacate.The waitperson suggested we might like an Indian beer and our fault for not inquiring about the price as they were S$17 each. Very small quantity of chicken in the curry but very liberal with the sauce. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant based on this experience
5
Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore so far.. Great food with very good service! Lagnaa has a chili scale (1-10) - a must try if you are a fan of spicy food.
5
Something new on the menu always and it is a special dining experience everytime, wonderful staff and amazing food!
5
Excellent indian food in the heart of little india. Has a real family feel to it. The food can be spicy so watch out.
5
For the past months I have been visiting Lagnaa about two times a month, always receive a warm welcome and the atmosphere is amazing. This month I had the luck to be one of the winners of their monthly competition where you get to be part of a jury, to taste and vote for 10 dishes, to determine the coming months 3 special dishes. Such a nice evening! Regarding the food, the staff always make sure to help you pick out what ever dish that matches your tastes, they really know how to work the Indian kitchen, do not forget to try the challenge were you have the possibility to get your name on a clip on the wall
5
I have lived in Singapore for two years and Lagnaa is one of my favorite Indian restaurants. The food and service are both great. Additionally, Lagnaa offers a good selection of Indian beers. If you are adventurous, Lagnaa has a chili scale on the wall (1 to 10) and you can test your tolerance. Only a handful of people have made it beyond level 6. Recently I particpated in a ten course tasting menu in which Lagnaa hosted ten guests to determine which three items should be selected for the December specials. Great experience, great food and it was clear that the management genuinely values the customers' feedback and recommendations
5
The tiny frontage of this lovely little restaurant in Little India (Upper Dickson St) belies its awesomeness. At the start of the day, this was my goal for lunch and I found it easily. I loved the dummy waiter statue outside and the come in and relax atmosphere. The lady serving was on great form, explaining to me the chilli challenge chart on the wall from 1 to 10 and the "peg" award line (those who have managed the challenge successfully, at whatever "hotness of chilli scale", are commemorated forever by a named "peg" on the line alongside the "hotness" chart. There are some crazy dudes at the top end of the "peg" line. I am a coward when it comes to chilli hotness so went for the Butter Chicken and Butter Naan at a score of 1.5 on the "hotness of chilli scale" - no "peg" for me (those taking-on anything below a 3 are not worthy of a "peg"). Butter Chicken and Butter Naan were divine - perfect portion size for lunch. Mango juice and coke to wash it down. Sheer bliss for an hour this place. I can see why it gets so high ratings from Tripadvisor members
5
Went upstairs to the barefoot dining downstairs is Western tables and chairs. We dined here during Deepavali week celebrations it was amazing. The naan was spectacular as were the dishes served in authentic metal platters. There is a chili challenge for the brave ones which we thought was Quirky and a toilet and handbasin upstairs. The diners were a mix of Indians and Tourists,even child friendly.They will not let you dine upstairs if you have a Henna Tatoo.The walls are white and stain easily. Best Indian dishes I had in One week of Singapore Holiday.!! Even had Indian wine
5
The taste of the food, mix and combination of the spices and ingredients resulted in tasting new flavours not tasted before, the food is great. Presentation of the food and friendly service , help with deciding on the selection on food on offer was excellent. The atmosphere upstairs in the barefoot area was lovely, calm and good for conversation with our friends go try the place if you are in the area Tony 
5
I had seen this restaurant on TripAdvisor and I knew I had to go here so I made it my first go to when I landed in Singapore. On arrival to the restaurant, I was unable to sit at a table downstairs as they were booked out so I would recommend making a reservation. They do have more seating upstairs which is still as good. Barefoot dining is exactly what it means once you walk upstairs. Beautiful little tables and cushions are awaiting you once you arrive and it makes you feel like you are somewhere in Mumbai having dinner. The food was perfect and the service was beautiful. I recommend anyone coming here for a delicious dinner
5
We came here on our honeymoon and couldn't recommend it more highly. It's not hard to see why this restaurant is so popular, the owners are great fun and go to a lot of effort to give you a good experience. They offered to talk through the menu and highlighted any specialties. Another key feature is the chilli scale which seems to have put this restaurant on the map. We had a butter chicken (1.0) and mutton masala (1.5) which were both delicious. The 1.5 had a delightful afterburn...I usually tolerate chilli but this packed punch. We had a chocolate mouse dish for dessert which was superb. Highly recommend a visit if you are in Singapore
5
Simply the best for us. We don't want to even try somewhere else when we feel like Indian food. Service is great and quick. The butter chicken is amazing. Thanks for the smiles you bring when we visit.
1
This restaurant targets foreigners. It's not that authentic and their marketing gimmicks is on the spicy level. Portion is very small. Super overpriced. Locals do not eat here only tourist. Two person for $80. Super disappointed. Never going back !!!!!!
5
Highly recommend the tasting platter and the butter chicken here is great (by Australian standards). Vegetarian curries were very good. Staff very accommodating and the meals well priced, approx. $100 with drinks for 4 adults.
4
Loved the food here, I tried at least 5 different Indian restaurants & nothing compared to this place. Great service & amazing food! A most do in Singapore!
5
Amazing flavour even at the level 6 spiciness. Chef really knows how to work with the ingredients while bringing the heat.
With the friendly staff, the whole experience makes you feel like you are dining at a friends place.
2
Curries all looked the same, and tasted similar, very little texture, the different spice levels just a gimic.No one that knows Indian food would rate this place highly.Service was decent but it hardly matters with such uninsipred food.The whole gimic of different heat level curries is just a ploy to cover up lack of culinary talent but clearly it works...Only good thign we consumed was the beer
4
It was tough, but I did it. Restaurant is in a cool location with open-air vibes. Average price (I think my lassi was more expensive than my actual dinner). I went for the level 6 challenge and it was hard, but I finished it. Not sure I'll be back to take on level 7. Staff was fun and friendly, service was prompt and everyone seemed to enjoy their meals, leaving full and happy
4
Came to Little India in search of good times with friends, good food, and good service. We found all three at Lagnaa . . Barefoot dinning and had a wonderful time taking on the spicy food challenge. The reviews were correct, this place is definitely worth putting on your checklist if you're in search of Indian cuisine and ready to challenge your tastebuds.
2
A restaurant where a Singaporean or Indian would never eat. You only see unsuspecting tourists sitting here.This is one of the restaurants in Little India area with below average Indian food and service. Yet they price the food up so high by inventing a fancy dining concept of sitting on the floor and eating. The floor is not clean, the cushions provided to sit are not clean. The low table was a not clean. The food that we ordered was poor in taste and ridiculous in quantify. And they argued with us about where we can sit and made us sit at a place where we did not want to sit though the restaurant and seat we wanted was empty until we left.Now you can price up an Indian dish to $20++ in CBD or Raffles area and it would seem reasonable given the rents you need to pay and a dearth of Indian restaurants there. But in Little India with some really great Indian food stone throw away in every direction, I can't believe it they are able to get away with such pricing for the quality, quantity of food offered and the 2 waiters only for 2 floors service provided.Dear foreign tourist, there are many Indian restaurants better than this around the area. Do not fall victim to social media hype and concept dining hype
5
Off a side street in Little India this is a little unassuming restaurant that offers the best curry I tried in Singapore!We sat outside and before ordering where brought a 'benchmark' level 1.5 curry - dishes are rated 1-6, you can't go up to 7 till you have tried a 6 and passed the test! We had a variety of dishes and all were delicious along with sides.The beer was reasonably priced (half of the cost compared to Clark Quay) and the wine was good value.Upstairs did not appear to be air conditioned but that didn't affect us outside. Very friendly proprietor who I had a long chat with about Singapore in general. It is no wonder he gets a lot of repeat business
5
Excellent curry and atmosphere. Highly recommended. 6 is very hot!! The quality of the food is second to none. :)
2
Went there for dinner. Had butter chicken and rice with naan. Chicken was not spicy instead a little bit on sweeter side
5
We have been twice to Lagnaa, staff are super friendly, food delicious and we liked the bare foot sit on the floor low tables but also sitting at the table downstairs an option. Right in the heart of little India. Great place.
5
We stumbled across this restaurant by chance as we wandered around Little India looking for somewhere for lunch. What a fantastic find and a wonderful surprise. The food was absolutely fantastic, cooked to perfection and so much better than the normal UK curries we have! The most enjoyable aspect was the service though. They took the time to explain the menu to us and the differences between cooking styles and heat in North and South India. And they absolutely adored our little 13 month old daughter, even giving her a personal foot massage! Couldn't recommend this place enough
5
The best curry i have had in ages!! We had samosas for entree. Quite small but delish and good because not too filling. Followed by butter chicken chicken korma and aloo ghobi. Butter chicken was a winner. But we wnjoyed the whole meal. Great experience. Would like to try it barefoot upstairs next time. I recommend booking it is very busy!!
5
This took me straight back to my roots! Simplicity at its best, yet not the norm when it comes to western dining. From the whole ambience to the way the menu is written, the humor in the menu makes you want to eat straight away. Something like..."Chicken Korma...pepper and cashew put chicken into a coma". When the food hit the short table, it was all worth it and more! I've never enjoyed food so much, sitting cross legged on the floor, barefoot, it was quite an experience that took me right back to my childhood. The service was superb, Kumari and the young,lanky ,tall, friendly fella who tried his best to explain the chilli levels and served us were quite great. Be warned, the chilli is hot! There was a Chinese lady sweating and looking rather a deep Beetrooty colour but had reportedly only managed to conquer level 4!! Highly recommended if you dare..we found out only 1 person in the last few years had completed level 9 and that record stands to date. We only managed a modest level 2 but we thoroughly enjoyed the flavours of India, the food as well as the service.
5
Excellent, tasty Food! Try the butter chicken and yogurt Rice (good to neutralize if the Food should be too hot for you – also the dishes we had where not too spicy)Nice and very friendly peopleNice drinks as well, try the peppermint lassi – refreshing and special
5
The only downside to this restaurant is that I only went there on my last night in Singapore. Had I gone there earlier I would have eaten there every meal. The food (butter chicken, as recommended by another reviewer) was super, great, excellent, super yummie... quite close to Little India MRT, if you can read a map, quite easy to find. Next time I'm in Singapore I will go back for sure, what else needs to be said..
5
Lagnaa have the best indian food, hands down. Make sure to have the chili chicken first and check the spice level and then move on to a curry of your preferred spice level. The lassi is a must have as well! Any flavour will be the best you've had
5
The food is SO good at Lagnaa, but the staff make it the most enjoyable experience. Eating at low level tables without your shoes on is a great, authentic twist. The flavours are just the best...haven't found an Indian restaurant in Singapore that comes close to Lagnaa
5
Great atmosphere, great staff. We were made to feel at home. The cooking was great. We had the curry challenge, I made it up to #6. Yes very hot!!!.
4
The dishes we ordered at lunch time were simple and presented without much fanfare. However, they were spiced perfectly and allowed a great experience of traditional Indian cuisine. The service was very friendly!
5
1st time going to this place for my wifes Birthday surprise. I was simply impressed with their delicious food and fabulous service. Definitely going there again sometime soon.Keep up the Good work team!
5
Very nice and welcoming people and delicious food! I learned about chillies and spiciness while eating and was also cheered through my curry challenge. A must for those who like it a bit spicier. But please remember that a hot curry always burns twice...
4
Lagnaa was recommended by a friend who had recently made a visit to Little India so we decided to give it a go. The food was delicious and the staff were really helpful and friendly in describing the various dishes and spice levels. The set up is fantastic, we ate downstairs and ordered the chilli chicken starter, two mains, 4 naans, dips and popadoms which came to $70 SGD, which we thought was great value. They also have a great selection of strong Indian beers which I had never seen before, served ice cold.The chilli challenge is fantastic especially if you love spicy food and have a competitive streak! I returned the next day and took on Level 6 which was a struggle but I made it. At the time of writing only one person has ever made it to Level 9!Thoroughly recommended as a restaurant and experience
5
The food here is awesome and the atmosphere is fun. As the name suggests, you need to remove your shoes to dine upstairs. You sit on cushions on the floor at low tables. Based in Little India, this is a curry restaurant with a difference. You can choose your level of spiciness for most dishes....we went 3 chilies, which is the hottest the chef will eat, spicy but just right if you love chilli. On a full moon you can go as high as 10 chillies. So far one man from Sydney, Australia has made it to 9, but no one has managed 10 yet.We didn't book, but I would suggest you do so. Even on a Wednesday we were lucky to get a table for 2. And if you can't sit on the flor, they have regular tables on the ground floor and the food is worth it. The food is delicious, the price is reasonable, the atmosphere is great and the beer is cold. A fun night out
2
My husband and I were really looking forward to having dinner here based on the reviews. We were served our starters about 45 minutes after our order and the mains were served very soon after. Unfortunately the starters had been left out in the kitchen too long. It was cold and rubbery. When we asked for a fresh serving, the manager argued that the food wasn't cold and that it had been served straight away. She went on to explain that it was a busy night. How is that my problem I do not know. I shouldn't have to eat cold food because it's a busy night for the restaurant. In the end she took the platter away and it was returned minutes later after being microwaved. She insisted it was made fresh again but my husband was able to see the microwave oven from where he was seated and it was definitely not made fresh. We refused the platter and it was taken off the bill. But it was no longer an enjoyable experience and we finally gave up on the meal and decided to pay the bill and leave.Till we left, the manager was insisting that the starters were served warm. Well they weren't. The whole incident could have been handled so much better by simply replacing the dish with a fresh platter accompanied and not arguing over and over. In the end the entire experience left a bad taste in our mouths. Won't be returning here
2
We were really excited about trying Barefoot considering some of the reviews we'd heard and read. We went by for dinner with friends - the ambiance is very comfortable and welcoming, and the service is warm and friendly. We had the Veg Pakora, Palak Paneer, Bhindi, Chana Masala, Kashmiri Pulao, & Garlic Naan. The portions are very small so we had to upsize the curries. One of the things that stood out was that the food uniformly was barely salted. In general, the food was low on flavour and any sort of spice. We checked on spice levels and everything pretty much was quoted as mild. Considering the place is known for the varying levels of spice and customising the food to the diner's tastebuds, the definition of spice levels would've been really helpful here! I wouldn't go back, as the food was very unimpressive
4
Great little place, we found it by accident and stopped for lunch. That was so promising we decided to go back in the evening and were welcomed back like long lost friends. Lovely people, lovely food, good value (for Singapore) and a large bottle of extra strong Kingfisher was a very nice accompaniment. Have to be a bit careful not to go OTT on the chilli ratings. Level 3 was fine, and probably 4 also, but when we arrived in the evening there was a young Chinese trying to get over a Level 6 and seemed in quite a bad way for a while! Loved the large statue with board outside too
5
Welcome to the caring world of new dining experiences! The Team and chefs at Lagnaa spend so much time making your experience stimulating, educational and when possible, very interactive and the competition of choosing the spiciest dish you can handle to compare yourself to others who have done the 'challenge" make Lagnaa a real experience rather than just a meal! Thanks team! :-
5
Very helpful staff. Would go back. Air con upstairs. Not very cheap but very good curries and very authentic foods. Helpful staff.
5
It has a very family feel. The people there are friendly and makes u feel at home. Food are served at a fast pace. It's quiet enough to talk to friends and spent quality time.
5
Its different in presentation and ambiance, simple buy tasty food. Might recommend to local more than people traveling.
5
Great place to enjoy with friends and family. Food portion is quite alright. Nice setup, the staffs are friendly and there is a homely feel to the whole place. Good place to celebrate small events.
5
Excellent little curry house which is located on a side street off the beaten track. We found it from the Lonely Planet book and from the outside we had second thoughts - we were wet through with sweat and there was no air con!Food however was excellent. I chose chilli level 3 and my other half had none. Her 0 was full of flavour, as was my 3, but my spice level nearly took my head off at that time of day. Without a few pints inside me to aid my adventurous streak I was glad I declined the level 4. Garlic naan was delightful, very fresh. Reasonable price for 2 including rice and naan, a beer and a soft drink, 23 quid. Would recommend as very tasty and efficient
5
We found this on trip advisor so decided to head there for lunch. The staff were great and the decor was very unusual but quirky. We ordered the butter chicken which was one of the best we've tasted as well as the yellow lentils rice and garlic naan. We loved everything we ate and also enjoyed the broad range of Beers. We will definatetly go back. I think the chilli rating is a bit of fun. Down a little side street pretty easy to find just follow the footsteps.

My husband and I have eaten a fair few indian meals in our time in the UK, in India and other parts of south east asia, but unfortunately this one was off the mark in authenticity. When the waitress insisited on us putting a number on the spice level we knew things were not looking up. In our opinion the flavouring of a dish should be left to the chef, and using what we think was red chilli powder to vary the spice level was something best left in the curry houses of the UK in the 1980's. On the plus side the chicken tikka and vegetable pakoras were tasty and they had a good selection of indian beers. They also made chapattis which were not on the menu. The bhindi dish we had was covered in a tomato sauce and for me bhindi should be served fairly dry. The vegetable koorma dish we had was passable but nothing to write home about. The service was average. They forgot about one of my husband's beers and seemed more interested in other diners.
5
The mango ice cream is so much better than anything one can buy anywhere ! The vegetables and meat is cooked so gently and well and they delight in cooking food to suit your tastes.If you want hot curry, which I did;t then they can heat it up to any level you dare to eat.The staff are so kind that I felt like a long lost friend, which was lovely when I was on my own.Plus the free wifi was just what I needed as I failed to buy a Singapore phone card - thank you

It's about 10 minutes from mrt and a bit of road from the main road about 30 steps.Had chicken curry with the best yogurt rice. Nice plate presentation very humble and good hospitality. Small but coz place perfect for small groups or for whom is travelling alone like I was

We were introduced to Lagnaa five years ago on our last trip to Singapore and made a point of reserving a table for this trip, long before we actually got here.Lagnaa is two restaurants in one - a 'regular' restaurant downstairs with chairs and tables and a more Indian restaurant upstairs where you sit barefoot on the floor with low tables and minimal silverware.Both times we've been to the upstairs part and both times the service, food and atmosphere has been excellent. There's plenty of variety of both meat and vegetarian dishes with a small but delicious selection of appetisers.Lagnaa is small - very small - and a tremendous amount of their business comes through word of mouth and (now) internet reviews. As such they don't have a need to fill tables more than once per night so if you want to spend a couple of hours or more sitting, shooting the breeze during and after dinner, that's just fine. The waiters will leave you alone unless you beckon, which I find to be a nice way to run things. The owner and his wife have been super friendly both times we've been and should we come back to Singapore, we'll make every effort to eat here again.Tip for American visitors. Lagnaa's mildest spice level (1.5) is on a par with what most US-based Indian restaurants would consider spicy. I'd suggest you order a couple of mild (1.5) dishes and maybe a 2.5 or 3 for comparison

We loved the food, the service, the fun around spicy levels. On the pricy side but very much recommended
5
Got trapped into the restaurant atmosphere and what a good surprise !!
Food is really good and staff is amazing
I definitely recommand this place
5
One of the finest meals I have eaten in a homely setting. With a variety of dishes and cooked to your heat specification it offers something for everyone.
4
We had a group meal and the food was excellent. The spice levels are insane so be careful! Also clarify whether you want a table or floor seating. Will be back!
4
We are here with our 3 kids. They were very accommodating with our younger children and the food was excellent. It was a little expensive but worth the visit.

Ee literally stumbled upon this restaurant as we were wondering what to eat at Little India. Such a surprising find! Food was good, the hosts were friendly and the chilli dessert is really interesting. Best part is that for those who can really eat spicy food, they have a spiciness level challenge! Go check it out!
5
We visited Little India and used a review from the lonely planet to dine at Lagnaa barefoot dining. The food was delightful, an excellent curry worth following a map to get there. Offered a starter to assess our 'chilli rating' and then main course is chosen with a chilli value. Food was delicious! Staff very friendly, and the Godfather beer wasn't too bad either. Highly recommend
2
we found it highly rated in trip advisor and decided to visit..but must say it is no more than a average restaurant especially if you are an indian tourist...the food was kind of tasteless because of less of salt and spice..may be to cater to the visitors who wouldnt like it too spicy.
5
As a family of five visiting from the UK, we were looking for this restaurant based on recommendations. It would be difficult to say if you would happen upon the place if you didn't know where to look. We did not get the opportunity to go upstairs to the barefoot dining but sat downstairs in a small but atmospheric room. My son and daughter-in-law wanted their 11 and 13 year-olds to 'taste' authentic Indian cuisine other than that back home.My son has quite a high tolerance for chilli-hot meals and on the wall next to our table was a list of 'hotness' based on the restaurants 1-10 scale. There are pegs attached to lines on the wall bearing the names of visitors who achieved level 4 and above. Pictures were attached to the handful of level 8 attainees and the lone photo of a level 9, although I wasn't sure if it was taken post-mortem!!! There were NO level 10s.Do not see this as a direct challenge! Remember only certain curries on the menu can be 'raised' in chilli-heat terms.Sensibly, the restaurant advises you to have a starter which is set at 1.5 on the chilli scale in order to allow your choice to be made accordingly. I chose a Koorma which was not on the 'hit-list' but was extremely tasty and green!!My son had a level 4 curry and said if he was honest, his limit would probably be a 6. So heat-freaks beware, if you do come here, prepare to visit at least twice and start 1 or 2 levels below your bragging level!The quality of food was very good and enjoyed by every family member. It was also presented very well and the service was good. I felt the cost was a little high in comparison to other restaurants but certainly didn't feel robbed.All in all, I would certainly recommend this restaurant to any 'Western' visitor wishing to eat good quality, authentic Indian cuisine in an enjoyable local atmosphere.As the street is often packed and is a fairly busy, tight thoroughfare, make sure you have the address with you when you go

My husband and I really wanted to have Indian food during our visit to Singapore and decided to go to Lagnaa. We made our reservation online and we were promptly answered. As my husband didn't fancy sitting on the floor, we made our reservation downstairs. We were seated at the entrance of the restaurant which is better than sitting inside as that's nearer the kitchen, and, since the ground level part of the restaurant is not air-conditioned, the nearer you are to the kitchen, the warmer it is. And there're also ceiling fans at the entrance area.The food was really good. My son, who normally is not easy to please, loved his Buttered Chicken. What was good, too, was that you could choose how spicy your food will be. Spice level 2 was enough for me, my husband had it higher. We finished everything that was served. The lime lassie was really good. The mango lassie was not as good, was a little too little mango, even less the second round.What disturbed our dining experience was that in front of the restaurant, repair works were being done. Towards the end of our meal, it got so loud that my son had to yell for him to be heard since they were doing drilling work. Why they had to do the repairs in the evening during business hours escapes me and was the main reason why we left and did not even look at the dessert menu. Maybe if we had sat in the barefoot area upstairs which is airconditioned, it would have been better.But in any case, the food is really good.
5
The food here is fantastic and the portion sizes are just right so you can order a few dishes to share and taste without feeling like you over ordered.
4
4pax had a wonderful lunch. Service excellent, food tasty n portion good. Masala tea was superb. Birthday dessert was very creamy n melted.
5
We were passing by in the area and popped for a meal with our 3 year-old, who is the fussiest eater! We loved our food and he was particularly happy with his chocolate naan bread, compliments of the chef. Great atmosphere and great food, thanks!
4
We went to the restaurant as a group of 8 and we're expecting some great food. Some was promised to be very hot from a great blend of spices. We were not disappointed. The food was great and the service was excellent.
4
In the middle of Little india we stopped by chance to this very nice indian small restaurant Of u are not used to eat indian The host Vino, will suggest you the best food to take .Don't miss the chicken butter.Not very cheap but it worth a stop! And if u like spicy food.. Make your challange .. Ask Vino to play and write your name on the the clothespin;) Silvi
4
It took my boss from Japan and a colleague from Hong Kong to introduce us to this little gem of a Restaurant of culinary delight..... My favorite dish has to be the Garlic naan and dhaal makhani. Simply divine! I did take the Level 6 challenge (Mutton)Concept and food looks appetizing.. Sure I will be back to visit. Especially to see what other delights we can sample
3
We are here on our first night after reading reviews and were ripped off, even if the food was tasty and the staff were friendly. If you like to have your Indian food less spicy then perhaps Laguna is the place for you, otherwise little India has many fantastic restaurants with similar food at more than half the price. We also had to argue with the waiter for the "spice level" we wanted and he wouldn't let us go above 3 which we weren't satisfied with. We asked to sit inside but we were sat outside, so we had no chance to appreciate the "barefoot dining" or any of the other highly rated aspects of the restaurant
5
Do you like spicy food? Do you like amazing service? How about a totally unique and fun dining experience? If the answer is yes, Lagnaa has it all. We first came on recommendation of a friend and as soon as we sat down (and I mean DOWN - you sit on the floor, barefoot as advertised), I could tell I was going to enjoy the experience. Everything on the menu is rated 1-9 on spice level (most people enjoy a 2-4; we tried a 5 and definitely felt the burn!) and there are all sorts of interesting North and South Indian dishes (don't skip Satan's Fiery Naan - one of my faves!).We came back a second time for a 10-course food tasting, during which you try different chefs' concept dishes with the intention of choosing the menu specials for the following month. Yet again - what a fun night! We got to taste and vote on all sorts of interesting nouveau-Indian dishes, all while enjoying our favorite Indian beers (an extensive list!) and the occasional lime lassi (tangy deliciousness).Whether you're a Little India local like us or a tourist looking for a really entertaining dining experience, Lagnaa is the place to try. Your palate and tummy will leave fully satisfied, and you'll have a smile on your face to boot. :
4
I'd read about Lagnaa on trip advisor but wasn't sure whether it was going to be touristy or a genuine experience. In fact we stumbled across the place by accident and were enticed to enter by someone sitting at the entrance (it could have been the owner). It appears dining downstairs is at normal tables whilst upstairs is the "barefoot sitting on the floor" offering. Being seekers of new things it was upstairs for us! I wasn't sure the five of us would fit around the low tables but we did. It was suggested that we calibrate our chilli tolerance by trying the chilli chicken rated at 1.5. The dish was enjoyable and not at all hot so that set our expectations that we could achieve great things. All at once my youthful "who can eat the hottest meal" competitive spirit returned. You get on the wall of fame by eating a three unaided but based on the chilli chicken I was sure a four would be fine. This was met with some scepticism by the person taking the order but I was undaunted. As it turned out four was absolutely fine. I now need to be held back from coming here every night to continue working my way up the hotness scale. Great fun
4
In the middle of Little Indian in Singapore, you'd walk past it and not notice it. Its not the sort of place that shouts at you and drags you in. The people are very relaxed and friendly, unassuming. But the food is fab if you take the time to stop! Really tasty. You can choose your temperature ie how spicy you want to go. You can event win a place on the league table if you want to compete with the spiciest of dishes. Lovely people, great food and you can sit and watch Little India rush by
4
Best indian restaurant so far. The food is excellent and staff is great! My favorites are dahi makni and fish tikka. Wonderful experience, cannot recommend enough!
4
It was out of box experience & loved the spicyness level & hawt hawt curries, Though the service was not upto the mark. Best was bday surprise for the girl.
5
I can not say enough good things about Lagnaa. The people that work there are wonderful, they make suggestions (always listen because they know what they are talking about). The food is spectacular, there is a scale of 1-10 for heat, I think you have to call ahead for levels 7-10. Let's just say I love spicy food and I'm not getting anything above a 3 here! The dal is fantastic, the aloo galbi to die for. The butter chicken is interesting with a hint of nutmeg, the chicken sambal is beyond good. (I could keep going but I think you get the point, it's all great!) The drinks can sometimes take a little long to be delivered to the table, but that is ok because if you order juice, they juice it fresh- so it is worth it! I love it here, there is seating downstairs with normal chairs and tables and then upstairs is barefoot dining on the floor. I have done both
5
I spent a lovely evening in Lagnaa! Had a wonderful battered chicken, amazing dessert and great Indian spiced tea. The owner- amazing host and Indian food specialist- accompanied me with an interesting conversation, and made me taste some new dish to be appearing on the menu! The food is well worth the price- highly recommended Thank you K7 :) !!
5
Just a warning ahead: If you order a spicy meal, they will make you eat the whole thing. So think twice :)You can choose from a range of 1-10 of spicyness (nobody has managed to finish a 10 yet ...)The atmosphere is beautiful, the music is nice. You sit on the floor with bare feet. The staff is helpful and lovely.
5
Wow, wonderfull place in little India. Super friendly and helpfull staff. Very good and tasty food. Tried the level 3 spice. Thats out of 10. Only one person has completed 9 :) 3 isnt that hot if you like spicy food. I should have tried 5.Good beer tooWorth a visit!
3
This a cute little restaurant with eye-catching decor and amiable staff. But I have to agree with other reviewers that the food is very average and very expensive. We had mutton masala, one of the chef's recommendations. It was small and the gravy was doughy - too much flour or corn starch perhaps - and uninteresting. I think it is clear the Indian community does not agree with the restaurant's TripAdvisor rating. They were down the street at a number of packed restaurants while a few sad foreigners who like us rely on TripAdvisor reviews sat at Lagnaa.
2
We are fond of indian food and followed tripadvisor recommendations but we were quite deceived by this restaurant. The food was ok but the portions were small and the prices clearly exaggerated. 12$ for 4 (very) small pieces of chicken curry only (no rice included of course), 8$ for a lassi, ... and 17$ the beer (ok 640ml but come on...).Singapore is an expensive city but in the current case, it is clearly exaggerated. The restaurant relies too much on 'travellers books' recommendations to find its customers.There are plenty of a lot cheaper restaurants in the same area, give them a try
4
We had really good fun at Lagnaa, my friend convinced me to take the chilli challenge while he whimped out with a level zero! Food was lovely, staff were so helpful and kind and knowledgable. I was delighted to get my peg on the wall of fame and then received a follow up email with congratulations and a pic. Really great experience in little India
5
This restaurant is by far the best part of my Singapore visit. The food was really good. everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. The staff was friendly and helpful. You can choose your level of spice and 2 was enough for me. :) I highly recommend this cute restaurant to anyone visiting Singapore
4
We visited this restaurant because it was recommended in Lonely Planet. Have to say it was one of the cleaner restaurants we saw in Little India so that was a bonus. Service was friendly and food was yummy if not a bit expensive.
4
This is a quirky cafe-style eatry in Little India. The food here is authentic and tasty and the service attentive.
However, not particular cheap.
5
Great authentic feel and food - loved the upstairs escape from the maddening crowd of Little India...
An assault on the senses and great service, but beware the pegs !
5
Excellent and informative cooking lesson and a wonderful dinning experience in the heart of Little India.

Heard of this place from my friend for the first time and did some google search for reviews and videos on youtube too! They have a very special concept where they do the chili challenge. Choose your spicy level from 1 to 10. All the people there are friendly and fun, like the dim atmosphere of the restaurant and it actually made me feel that I am on a holiday mood! Before we decide to choose the chili level, they served a small portion of chicken which is level 1.5 of spiciness. It was delicious! This is the right way to help us to judge how is the spiciness and I decided to do level 3 for a start! We were allowed to have the masala chicken with rice or naan, but you need to finish the whole dish by yourself to complete the challenge! My friend did level 6! We completed the challenge at last and were given the clip to write our name and YAY! Our name is in the list! We were invited for the Fullmoon Chili Challenge Party as well. Leave your email and contacts for more chili challenge and food tasting sometimes! They do cooking classes as well! Worth a try and definitely want to go for higher level next time! They have good variety of food on the menu, and all of them seems yummy to me! Thanks for everything. See you guys soon! =

On our last night in Singapore we headed into little India to find ourselves an authentic Indian restaurant. Our hotel (Wanderlust) recommended Lagnaa barefoot dining which was just down the road. We nearly missed the restaurant as we walked straight past it however when we found it, it was unique and warm. The walls are covered in writings from past diners and visitors. We went upstairs where it is barefoot. To eat, you sit cross legged in the floor. It's a wonderful, simple and peaceful room. The waiter was very friendly and gave us some great advice on what to eat and what spur level we were likely to enjoy. He was bang on too. The dishes were simply sublime and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. I fully recommend a visit to this amazing restaurant.
4
Came to Singapore for a weekend to see a friend who was flying through. Saw a review of Lagnaa on TA and thought it sounded like fun. Booked a table and Shanti got back to me straight away to confirm the booking. When we arrived we were shown straight to our table and Shanti helped us to order a number of great dishes. Food was excellent as was the service and the atmosphere. Would highly recommend Lagnaa for anyone visiting Singapore
5
Very personable service. Small restaurant, giving each guest very personalised attention. Appreciated the pictures taken and then sent via email to us. It is hard to find a place that feels like you are going home for a meal in busy Singapore these days. But Lagnaa fits the bill.
4
We went for a cooking lesson to Lagnaa..Barefoot dining and had a great experience learning how to cook Butter Chicken. Chef was great and knowledgeable and made it a fun experience. We also had dinner after and found the food very tasty and wonderful, staff also very friendly. A wonderful experience in the heart of Little India
5
My boyfriend and I have visited the place couple of time. The food is amazingly good and we cant get enough of it each time. We also learnt about chillis and spices from the friendly staff there. Be sure to leave your contacts down as if you are fast enough to reply to Lagnaa's SMS, you will get an invitation to the monthly food tasting for new menu. Thumbs up!!   
5
It was an amazing experience. Very warm staff simply perfect! Food is a must try really ! Go Lagnaa !
4
I went here with my fiance and wanted to have small surprise for him. I requested the staff and they were extremely co-operative and arranged everything at a short notice - the surprise turned out very well and we had a great overall dining experience.
5
Excellent Food and Service!
The personalized service is exceptional
The food is the right portion and just like home cooked food
Presentation is excellent
5
Very good food in small restaurant. You can chose the level of spicyness you want. And the people are really nice. Would go back there anytime!
4
Very delicious and well-made Indian food. Recommend to sit upstairs and be barefeet. A bit expensive but worth it.
5
I have been a regular here for the past couple of months. On 17th afternoon, I decided to drop in to check out on the crowd size on weekends.. My friend ordered Mango Lassi, while I ordered the Lime Lassi. Shanti has been a great help in recommending the drinks. The Lime Lassi was fresh on the palate and refreshing on a hot Sunny Da
5
Worth searching out. Terrific tasty Indian food - trusted the owner to choose for us - stunning selection. The staff are genuinely friendly and made us feel very relaxed. Considering Singapore is generally pretty expensive - this felt like really good value. Give it a go
5
We found this place by chance and did not regret to stay and eat our holiday's last meal here. Such delicious Indian food with great combinations, taste and presentation, and one can choose the wanted chili level. Super friendly staff who offered us to go to nicely decorated upstairs, barefoot of course :) When leaving the lady heard we are on our honeymoon and we were offered a free dessert and got a video of us eating it. A bit pricy but truly worth it
5
My wife and I stopped in here during our honeymoon after having some great Indian food for lunch in the nearby hawker stalls and reading positive reviews of Lagnaa, hoping to find a dinner that would top off a day of memorable eating experiences, and Lagnaa really exceeded even our high expectations. The service was friendly, attentive, and genuine. My wife and I both remember it as the best Indian meal we've had during our travels. The fish curry was delightfully spicy, the sweet and sour eggplant dish was unique and delicious, and the recommended yoghurt rice was a perfect complement to both dishes. We'll definitely be coming back next time we're in Singapore
5
This is my second time dining at Lagnaa. The spices taste extremely fresh and the chef will meet with you to discuss how you would like your meal. My wife cannot eat dairy, and they prepared dishes special for her needs, just wonderful. It may not be obvious, but you can eat downstairs or upstairs. We recommend upstairs. The atmosphere is great, but be aware there are no seats (you sit on the floor on a pad). We love this style, but for some people this may not be comfortable. Hint, look for a pad by the wall so you can rest your back! The food here is truly amazing, but you will not be getting cheap eats. We spent $126 Sing for two adults and 3 small children. No alcohol and just two meat dishes. But, for the quality and service I do not mind it much. Definitely some fantastic food in a wonderful atmosphere that feels far removed from the chaos of Little India. One hint for people visiting Singapore, Little India is purely insane on Sunday afternoons/evenings. I strongly recommend you consider any other night of the week EXCEPT Sunday - not unique to this restaurant, but if you come on a Sunday evening, you almost certainly will not get a taxi out of Little India without a massive wait or you will wade through crowds of men wandering the streets on their day off. Go and enjoy this great food, just do it on Monday-Saturday night
5
The food there is excellent,and the customer service is superb. Not many restaurants allow their customers to choose their spice level,but this restaurant does. They even threw in a birthday ice cream because it was my birthday. A must visit if you are in Singapore!
5
Very nice place to taste Indian food and specialities. The team is very friendly and give good advices to choose. The food are realy good with different spice levels. Perfect place to have dinner with friend or couples.
5
Everything you want from a restaurant in Little India - warm, friendly service and exceptionally good food. Will definitely return again.
4
This is a fun spot for a taste of Indian food. Food is really good and the staff is very friendly. The service is a tad slow.
5
Firstly ...... What a find , it was the best.The hosts were friendly and great to talk to .Beer was ice cold..... How it should be and the selection of Indian beers was vast , great work.The food was gorgeous and full of flavour, my dish I love was not on the menu but no problem at all as they made it at my request.... Now that's service. Had the sheesh kebab, chicken tikka , chicken saag, saffron rice and cheese naan. Could not fault one thing.What made us go there was as we walked by they smiled and said hello , did not follow up with the usual request to dine there (don't like being hassled), so when we turned up 2 minutes later we were greeted with "your back, welcome" . Another fantastic thing that needs to noted was there was a baby in the restaurant and crying as babies do , so the owner took the baby and patted his back and rocked away while his parents ate their meal, he fell asleep and his parents were able to eat without concern, just wonderful.I will defiantly be back next time we are in Singapore and I will let anyone know this is where to go for great Indian food.You have the choice of downstairs with fans and the street parade, upstairs (bare feet only ) sitting on fusions on the floor in air conditioning and there is a third level for a private meal with friends and family.Thank you again for a wonderful afternoon 
5
Excellent butter chicken, great balance of flavour but also a good one if you're not accustomed to spicy food. They do a great garlic naan, just the right amount of garlic without being overpowering. Great atmosphere and very friendly hosts - I'll definitely be going there again. :-
5
We were looking for a good curry our first day in Singapore. We ended up here more by chance than anything else. We had a curry with heat level 1.5 and one with heat level 2. It does not sound like much, but it was. The brave people that managed higher levels get their name on a peg on the wall. I WANT ONE!!! Friendly, helpful staff, good food! Pick this place if you have a chance
5
The food was really delicious.. they had a great selection on their menu and the ambiance was adorable! I loved eating on the cushions on the floor and the upstairs room was really cute. I will definitely go back whenever I go back to Singapore. The staff was also very friendly. Highly recommend
5
My wife and I went to Lagnaa last night and had not just an amazing meal, but wonderful service. The food was incredible, and the service so passionate, attentive and welcoming. I can highly recommend the mutton masala. At the end of the meal we mentioned we were in Singapore for our honeymoon and they made us sit down and brought us out a special dessert and took loads of photos that they later sent us. Couldn't recommend this place enough, if ever I'm in Singapore again I will be going straight back to Lagnaa. Thanks everyone at Lagnaa for a GREAT night!
5
I randomly found Lagnaa the first time I went by opening Google Maps and looking at what was around. I never regretted it: excellent butter chicken, great ambiance and service. I came back yesterday for a second visit to confirm my excellent first impression and that was an obvious second win
5
OMG The July specials are amazing, we had the mutton, chicken, lentil rice and the amazing sag paneer dish - All excellent.
4
Great food and a super friendly team. Relaxed atmosphere. Different spice levels available. Perfect for a relaxed evening with friends...
4
Gotta try the Lagnaa spice challenge! Great fun, definitely not for the faint-hearted!!! Hubby tried and it was so good, he was crying literally! S:)
5
We had a great time with Lagnaa, service was always good. Good to spend the evening there with friends/couples. Do not leave there without trying their chilli level. :D
Thank you once again, looking forward to cooking classes and chilli challenge!
4
Food is really good. Just be careful with the spices! I ordered non spicy butter chicken and I could still feel my tongue burning somehow. I really enjoyed the Massala ice tea.
Oh, and prepare your pocket, because it is quite pricey.
2
Its only for people who want to have a different experience of barefoot dining.There are different spice levels for the dish which makes this restaurant unique.But they just seem to add more and more chilli powder to make it spicy and it tastes terrible.Though there were a few dishes (only a few) which had a standard spice level and they were pretty good.Also its on a expensive side
4
Fancy a place you can literally kick back and relax in? This is it. The place is usually heaving, especially during weekends so make reservations - and the best part is when you do, you can actually order something special. Shanti, for instance, managed to get for us fresh fish head for curry. 
4
Usually come here for a get together meals with friends. Personally find the atmosphere and ambience is really authentic yet unique. You actually sit on the floor with cushions and low table while eating tasty indian cuisine! Food are delicious depending on the level of spiciness and hotness!Will come here again for a unique dining experience with friends
5
We organised for a group of friends to take each other on in a "spice challenge" at Lagnaa barefoot dining. Shanti and the Lagnaa family were so great at helping us to organise a table for our group and were excellent hosts! The food, lassi's and atmosphere were spot on and legit - we will be back again to attempt the next spiciest dish! Thanks for a brill evening
5
I would recommend this for travellers to visit. The place is nice and cozy and the food is pretty amazing. The waiters are nice and would explain what is used to cook the food and also you get to choose the level of spicyness. If you are really adventurous then go ahead for Level 6. The mutton curry was awesome as the sauce was thick with flavour. Highly recommended if you are into Indian cuisine or really adventurous..
4
Had little money and ate here. Simple curry sauce with rice or bread and was absolutely delicious. Some of the best curry we have eaten. Waitress was really lovely and helpful.
5
Superb service staff that were very friendly and genuine. Homely atmosphere adds a unique twist to the usual dining experience. Would most definitely recommend this restaurant to other circles of friends!
5
Had a great time at Lagnaa's. Fantastic service, wonderful attention and staff that were fun and friendly. Be warned, the chilli challenge is not for the faint hearted. I am still recovering
5
I have been visiting Lagnaa for years and love the place.
It's all about the food, as it should be...
5
Have been visiting Lagnaa ever since I turned up in Singapore and absolutely love it. Best Indian food in Singapore, with brilliant service and great ambiance - everyone MUST try it! You will not be disappointed.
5
Stopped in for lunch and enjoyed one of the most flavoursome curries in Singapore. Tried the fish curry with yoghurt rice, together with super-tender morsels of chicken tikka. And fresh lime juice to cool down. The place has a chilled vibe and great service at a fair price
4
A small local restaurant in Little India aimed at the western tourist. Very friendly and passionate owner and staff. K7 very proud of his parathas and naans and rightly so. Wonderful choice of Indian beers - a lot I have never heard of. I don't want to be negative as the staff were so very nice but if I am really honest the curry did not blow me away. It lacked a depth of flavour. Portion size perfect for me but some might think on the small side. Do visit though as it is a nice friendly experience
4
We had a great experience at Lagnaa. Our waiter introduced us to the menu and explained the "chili" levels which was interesting. We picked level 2 and ordered a chicken entree, with lamb, fish and an eggplant dish as mains accompanied with some rice and naan. The food was very nice and chili levels were just right For us. The place itself was very clean and had a nice ambience. I highly recommend this venue and we're definitely going to go back and maybe this time be adventurous and go up in the chili levels

This quirky place in Little India will offer, if nothing else, a memorable dining experience. The managers of the restaurant are extraordinarily friendly, a real rarity in Singapore, and I think it adds to the experience. The food is of a very good quality. Be warned: this please appeals overwhelmingly to Westerners, who appear to make up the vast majority of its patrons. Among the highlights for me are the "Dessert Experiment", where you name a price (over $10) and the chef will make a bespoke dessert for you. The dessert itself is not really worth the price, but there is a real element of fun in anticipation of what you will get, and then later guessing the ingredients, and it is different each time (I've tried it three times).Other gimmicks include choosing a naan with a "special message" (I did not try), and specifying from 1-6 the spiciness level of certain dishes (I've tried from levels 1-6). All of these gimmicks create for a rather fun dining experience, if you have an open mind. It's something different from the typical mediocre cookie-cutter dining experience in Singapore. My main criticism of this place is that the portion sizes are too small for what you pay. Unless you have a very small appetite, or just want to fill up on naan (itself very expensive compared to other places), you will end up spending quite a lot.In sum, I recommend this place for the uniqueness of it, where the manager will engage you in friendly banter, where you can challenge and evaluate your tolerance for spiciness (tread carefully with a "level 6"), and you can experience a "bespoke" dessert unlike any that you will have tried in Singapore. However, all of this quirkiness comes for a hefty price tag which is not proportionate to the amount of food you will get (even by the horrid standards of Singapore's dining scene). So if you find quirkiness refreshing in a land that rewards conformity and large chain restaurants, then do give this place a try! If you are just after a "value for money" meal, then give it a miss

Dined here last Sunday with my family and a friend. Always wanted to check this place out to try their chili challenge and finally did it. The menu is pretty basic with few items that are made from chef's exclusive recipe. We ordered Yogurt rice, garlic naan, chicken tikka masala ( level 2), jeera rice with okra masala ( level 6) along with lemon soda and lime lassi. The chili challenge works this way. You choose a side and its heat level from the scale of 1 to 6. You're only to eat only main along with your side and you can't eat yogurt rice. You're not allowed to drink water as well. Follow these rules and wipe your plate clean then you're deemed as a winner. Level 10 is the highest and you do that challenge only on a full moon day. Level 7 to 9 can be done only after completing level 6 and you have to complete each level before trying the level 10 dish.The food was pretty average. The jeera rice was tasteless. The chicken tikka masala was let down. The chicken didn't taste like it was grilled in the tandoori oven. The garlic naan was passable. The level 6 okra masala tasted raw due to the excessive use of chili powder. The drinks were fine though. We ordered two masala teas and it was pretty good. its an unique concept of chili challenge and barefoot dining but its nothing impressive for an Indian who dines barefooted every day at home. As for the chili challenge, give it a miss if you're an Indian. I bet you won't appreciate the raw taste of chili powder which is used as the primary ingredient for the heat in all their dishes. Overall, its just an average restaurant

This place changes my perception of Indian cuisine forever. Must try are their curry Threadfin, butter chicken, and lime lassi. Kulfi is another yummy dessert goes for.

Lagnaa just startet this Kind of concept. We were there with a whole group of 10 People and had great fun. The Food is amazing as well as the hospitality and the kitchen expereince was "hot" as well as the Level 4 gravy :-)

This is a little restaurant in Little India with a funny and very nice host. The food is spiced in accordance to your own whishes and the end result is just a great food experience.

My wife and I love curry and we’ve eaten lots of them over the years to know the good from the bad. We both agree that Lagnaa does the best curry we’ve ever had and is definitely a “must do” for any trip to Singapore.There are many reviews on Trip Advisor that explain why Lagnaa is both different and special than other restaurants. It’s authentic, simple Indian dining at its finest, and the waiting staff are as hospitable as the food is amazing.Jenny and H – Perth, Aus

We organised a leaving dinner for our friends at Lagnaa. We had 3 tables for 12 people on the 2nd floor. The food was awesome and the staff very friendly and helpful. They accomodated our special diet requests well.Shanti was a great organiser and communicator, helping us to arrange the event and sending us menu choices. She was very accomodating and a fantastic hostess. She even sent us photos of our group on the night!Wonderful experience all in all and it will definitely be a place we will take our friends/visitors back to

Visited Lagnaa Barefoot Dining on my recent trip to Singapore. Located in little India its a double story restaurant. To eat up stairs, leave your shoes at the front.You'll notice the HOT scale on the wall down stairs, I LOVE hot food, and could only handle a level 3. Be sure to ask about their challenges.The food was incredible, and the staff so friendly and laid back. Enjoyed a chat with the lady down stairs, as she handed us a texta to write our review on the wall. Memorable!Can't wait to return!Ps. Cocktail of the month - TRY

Lagnaa is just plain awesome!Nested in Little India where there are other competitive Indian restaurants, none will be able to measure up in terms of constant good food quality and constant friendliness of the hosts.We can always get good food any where, but not many places can deliver a constancy of exceptional food each and every time. How do I prove it? Well, personal experience!2 years ago, my then-boyfriend had his first bite of Lagnaa's level 6 Tikki Masala Chicken and I had a fish curry. He wanted to challenge himself and completed it within 10-15 minutes. At the end of our dinner, he could not get enough of the curry! I was still scoping my fish curry with the delicious garlic naan. The fragrances of the curry spices, the heat of the curry and the freshly made naan was still salivating in the air for him as he eyed my curry, but I was trying to complete my own level 4 challenge! The most amazing observation was that a spicy dish would usually leave you cringing and numb taste buds, but for Lagnaa's curry, the spiciness actually enhances the flavours of the curry and packed a good punch. When my then-boyfriend returned to the States, he was not able to return to his favourite Indian restaurant because he was upset that it did not match up to Lagnaa's high standards. Finally, after 6 months, he gave in as he needed his weekly dose of Indian food.Last May, my SO came to Singapore (since two years ago) as we were getting married in Singapore. He proclaimed that he is not leaving Singapore without going back to Lagnaa and off we went. We had the same Tikka Masala Chicken (level 4), a prawn curry (level 3), lentil, leek naan and saffron rice as per recommended by the host. It was perfect! The leek naan was a special on the menu and it was a good match with all the curries. The saffron rice was cooked perfectly with each grain being not too fluffy and not too dry. The curries were, as always, flavourful and thick. Tikka Masala Chicken did not only maintained my husband's high standards but reaffirmed that Lagnaa wins handsdown for all curries. The curry's thickness is not of one you overcook it, but the consistency of a well-timed dish. The de-shelled prawns were not shrivelled but rather juicy and plump. To top it off, the host and the chef provided us with a newly created dessert upon hearing that we were newly-wed. The sweetness of the Rava Kesari at the top added a good balance to the home mad yogurt pudding and curbed any remaining spiciness.It goes to show that the master chef has taught his team well and each chef is very talented.You MUST make the effort to dine at Lagnna barefoot dinning and experience the exceptionally good food, the friendly hosts and the magical atmosphere when you are dining at the second storey.Thank you Lagnaa for making every trip memorable for us

Went to Lagnaa for lunch today, together with a friend. We had a soursop juice and mint lassi to drink which were super refreshing and not too sweet. Then ordered vegetarian food of which there is a nice range and the kind lady working there recommended a couple of dishes which go well together. In addition we had some rice and the super yummy cranberry naan (which alone is a reason to return to this restaurant). All food is cooked freshly, you can determine how spicy you want your food, the veggies were delicious, spicyness varied (brinjal quite spicy, paneer mild) and while waiting, you can read all crazy comments scribbled on the tiles or find out who managed to eat spicyness factors above 5 - have no idea how people manage!! Nice and friendly place when you want to rest from the buzz of Little India
5
OK, I have tried nearly all the places listed here on TA for Little India. Somehow, I missed Lagnaa. A friend of mine (from India) recommended I try this place out. It is a tad tricky to find by cab, they will probably miss it, but once you get to Upper Dickson you are close enough, you can walk around and find #6. It is worth it! They asked us if we wanted upstairs (A/C) and sit on the floor bare foot, or, sit outside or in the lower part. We opted for the upstairs, which I think is far more fun and better ambiance. The waiter will sit down with you on the floor and discuss the menu. He recommended we stick with spicy level 2 or less. Because of our son, we went with spicy 1.5, which was a solid recommendation. It still had some kick, but I could have handled 2 easily. We had the mutton chef's special, AMAZING! I cannot even describe it accurately. We also had a vegatable special, which was good, but not amazing. The naan was good and the tandori chicken was fabulous. We also had saffron rice which was the best I have had in Singapore. This place is great, please don't come too often as I hope to get a table when I return over and over again this summer
5
I returned to Lagnaa this weekend after first visiting in April 2015, I was craving their Mutton Masala dish and had decided to back down to a level 5 as I was eating late. This restaurant has dishes that are prepared to your particular need for heat, usually 1-6 with a by invitation only to try levels 7+!! ^ is super hot but very tasty and if you add vegetables such as Bindi it is amazing. Probably the best curry I have had in Asia for sure. I invited the Owner & Chef, Kaesavan (K7) to join me for a beer and he treated me to sea salt chilli poppers and chili chocolate sauce, this was amazing but it was so spicy that I had to assume a yoga position to deal with the heat of the chili and the head rush that I got from this special treat from K7! Be warned that chocolate sauce is dulike dynamite to the body - WOW :-
5
While visiting Singapore I went with working colleagues from Singapore to this Restaurant. What should I say ... fantastic food and very nice people. I'll be back.
4
Warm welcome and good shop recommandation to buy India peppers. I did level 6 which quite uncommon for a Frenchman and ....I survived. I move to another spice level when I come again in Singapore !
4
Great food and hospitality. Very nice staff and had a good chat whilst enjoying the food. Nice and hot, and looking forward to getting to the Level 7+ heat level.

On my third visit to Lagnaa, I had the pleasure of dining inside for the first time. My two previous evenings had been "special events" hosted for the Singapore chapter of the International Curry Club and located in the impromptu alfresco setting of the laneway. :) As per usual, my most recent visit was filled with wonderful food and excellent, smiling service. As I was due on an early morning flight the next day, we dialed down the spice to "Level 4". Rather than detracting from the flavor, this added to the subtleties of the varying spices in each dish. The result was a new look at the same meals I had had previously and an improved enjoyment (and more breads). I highly recommend you experimenting with the spice level of the same dish on multiple visits to find your balance. If you are looking for a mid-priced, authentic and exceptional curry experience in a comfortable and friendly setting, look no further. Well done to the Langaa team for their great restaurant. I will be back

Food was great.. Their menu is creative and fun to read :) Challenges etc got us excited and we looked forward to the food :) The seating arrangement is comfortable! Would be awesome if they had something better than a cushion to sit.. something with back support would be awesome! :) All in all, we loved the food and had a great time :
5
Everything from the food, ambience and staff especially Mr.Vinoth were so good, feels/smells/taste Good. We were two couples along with our brother went for lunch. We were firstly intoduced to the hotel and its function such as wat do they provide, wat has the menu to offer especially the ones with barefoot (can not get anywhere wlse) amd thumbs up (chef says must try). After quite flaunt introduction, we start up wit starters like lassi, Gundu urundai, vada type. So much to offer differently and so nice that you will remember it for sure. There are combos for couple and couples. Later we came to know Lagnaa means lakknam (லக்னம்) - spiciness Spice level starts from 1.5 to 10 where yu can go upto level 6 if you dare. More than that is all that yu bet on yurself.On a whole, from starters, main course and dessert it was wholesome.For those under budget, you may try combos with lagnaa. Will go there again
5
We visited Lagnaa whilst on honeymoon in Singapore on the recommendation of our guide book. When we arrived the owners and staff were so friendly they really made us feel at home, the atmosphere is lovely and the food is really delicious. The spice challenge adds a bit more fun to your evening and my husband now wants to travel back to work his way up the clothes pegs (he only got a spice level 3!). Definitely worth a visit if you are traveling to Singapore
5
As an American expat living in Singapore, and traveling extensively for work, I search out Indian restaurants where ever I go. I keep a mental list of the best Indian spots around the globe. Lagnaa is now on the top of the list. Tucked away in a side street in the heart of Little India (one of Singapore's most lively and authentic ethnic neighborhoods), this hidden gem features "barefoot dinning" - upstairs seating on the floor (with cushions) and no shoes. (You can also eat downstairs with shoes - but upstairs is a much better atmosphere). A good variety of non-vegetarian and vegetarian options, from Northern and Southern Indian cuisine - with quality ingredients and complex, thoughtful curries. Fantastic. I judge an Indian restaurant on their Dal and Nann. Both are exceptional at Lagnaa. But you go for the heat. Lagnaa has a curry challenge for guests. You can order the dishes on levels of spice (0 being "normal" and 5 or 6 being the maximum)(although there is a rumor of an Australian man that ate at 10). I have a high tolerance for heat and started with the "4" for with my chicken vindaloo. It was fantastic. Hot for sure, but not in an obscene and crude way. Rather, the heat was slow to arrive and subtle, albeit strong. To reward my accomplishment, I was entered into the "hall of fame" which consists of wooden cloths pins with your name on it strung along the downstairs dinning room. I have been back several times and completed level 5 for the vindaloo. Again, it was terrific.I have dined at Lagnaa with friends and for business. It is a great spot for visiting friends and business associates as it provides a nice slice of Little India in a unique setting (upstairs on the floor).In short, very good food in a charming atmosphere

Went with 22 friends on Saturday 23 may 2015. Had made a booking for 18 but unfortunately for a few more than expected. Hostess was less than accommodating, chastising us for not booking in advance, and generally behaving very much as a headmistress throughout the evening. We had to make do with four tables which we squeezed into, as the rest had been booked. For tap water, we were asked to fill glasses ourselves from the pantry. The service was efficient but done extremely curtly, I felt that friendliness and ability to accommodate was missing. The food was not anything one could write home about. The palak paneer was especially bland, and the fish curry was more gravy than anything else. Our friends had Great fun trying the spice challenge, but if you came here for decent food, as I had, then you were left very disappointed, especially because of the $50 a head bill. On a plus, the sukki coffee was incredible
5
Fabulous evening at this Indian Restaurant in Little India. Don't be fooled by appearances. This is a diamond. Tasty food, we had the chicken tikka, the mutton masala level 2 spiciness, the spinach and cottage cheese. Everything was exceptionally tasty. The lime juice was a perfect accompaniment. But what made the night was our fabulous hostess Shanti. She was a pure delight and made us feel as if we were dining in her home. Will be back next time we are in Singapore and we'll send our friends
5
This was honestly the best Indian food I have ever tasted! Absolutely incredible staff! Would come back in a heartbeat!!
4
Just visited the place..very tasty food.. Not just spicy but it also stays in your mouth...preparation is different from regular same dishes at other restaurants..great friendly service..
5
Great service. Good for non spicy food diners as well as spicy food lovers! Will surely visit again :)
5
Had level 5 prawn masala and naan. Amazing meal, quite spicy but I was looking for that (you can get it normal or less spicy).They make everything in house including yogurt which is incredible btw. Amazing place, staff is super friendly and very welcoming. Next time I'm Singapore I'll visit for sure

We had allowed ourselves one day in Little India, on a recent trip to Singapore, and knew that our lunch absolutely had to be at Lagnaa Barefoot Dining. We had our visit there at the end of April and it was a great experience. It was a very warm day and to start the meal off with mango lassi was perfect - so refreshing. We were given plenty of advice as to what we should order. We ended up with the Fish Curry, Palak Paneer and Bhindhi - all of which was thoroughly enjoyable. The "chilli honour wall" is a great idea and the seating, upstairs, on the floor is another thing that makes this restaurant stand-out. From the lovely people who served us to the chef who was very invested in the meal and finally to the photo they sent us afterwards ..... we had a great time and would definitely visit again when next in Singapore
4
My friends and I had an excellent dining experience at Lagnaa barefoot dining. We came for their spice challenge and being the fire eater that I am I went for their spiciest curry (level 6); Levels 7-10 are only available during full moons. The curry was hot but it had good flavor (after a few bites I couldn't taste much because my tongue was on fire). I drank a delicious mango lassi to cool me down after eating the curry. Some of my friends can't handle spice so they got mild dishes which they said were good. The service was excellent as well; very friendly, attentive, and quick. Overall we had a lovely dinner and a great time dining at Lagnaa
5
We were walking in Little India at evening first night we arrived to Singapore and came across this place. Thank god we did! Do not let the street facade of the establishment fool you! We were taken to a table witch was located upstairs in a wonderful dining room. All tables there are "benchless" so you get to sit on a floor enjoying the nice ambience and grate service of the place. Food was simply amazing, We had butter chicken and a vegetable curry + amazing naan. When we paid the bill the owner found out that We were on a honeymoon so they served us a little bonus surprise as a dessert (Indian Icecream) not my cup of tea but a very nice gesture! Overall i would say one of the best if not the best Indian restaurant I have ever visited. Pros:+Good service+Amazing food+Good selection of beers+Very nice setting Cons:- might be hard to find- might be full if you dont have reservation - price could be tiny bit cheaper (but this is Singapore after all
5
Such a refreshing change from the standard soulless disappointing Singaporean restaurant experience where the staff seem to look through you and the management are out for a quick cash grab. Our meal at Lagnaa was wonderful. The staff and chef were so friendly and welcoming. We spent the entire meal chatting with them and sharing stories. The food was delicious and beers so refreshing (warning - the lesser know. indian beers are strong so leave the car at home and get a taxi!) The good was delicious - great to sample lesser known treats like the salted chilis with yoghurt. Take the staff's recommendations regarding spice levels. I love very hot curries but the level 6 spice was too much for me! Will definitely be back. Cheers, Alex and Melissa
5
I have lived in Singapore for 3 years and have tried many Indian food restaurants. This is hands down one of the best places for food, environment, food, atmosphere, and food. Lagnaa is in the heart of Little India and if you aren't looking for the place, it can be missed as it falls more into the "hole-in-the-wall" category from curb appeal when compared to some of the more touristy establishments. Don't be fooled. This place is amazing.The staff is wonderful and the chef/owner often will come to the dining room to talk to the guests, explain his take on the foods, and recommend from the menu and off the menu if you so wish. In addition to fantastic non-spicy food, Lagnaa will also cater to your spicy side and add different levels of spicy "heat" to any dish you wish to your liking.Go there and then go there again and again. If you are only visiting Singapore, make this one of your dinner engagements. You will not be disappointed
5
I went to Lagnaa with my mother for Mother's Day. They suggested on the phone that I help to prepare her curry in the kitchen for her which was a fantastic idea. My mother was thrilled and we both loved the food. 5/10 on the chilli chart- not too shabby! Definitely recommend this place
4
A nice and cosy place to chill out and relax with friends. We tried their set menu and the fish curry is fiery to the tongue, yet enjoyable. Would recommend to my friends and worth visiting again.
5
Very delicious indian food and if u wish also spicyyyyy. Love it! You can chose your spice level from 1 to 10. I was already satisfied with level 3.
4
Tasty authentic food, relaxed cafe style atmosphere, with great hosts who really made the evening fun!
5
Excellent service and wonderful food in this traditional, family run restaurant. I discovered it by accident in 2007 and I make a point off eating there every time I visit Singapore. In my opinion the best India restaurant in Asia.
5
My favorite Indian restaurant in Singapore, and a must-visit for anyone who enjoys excellent food, with advice and service from friendly, attentive and knowledgeable staff, in casual surroundings. And I speak as a vegetarian and something of a fussy eater!Do try the roasted onion naan. I first asked for it about 5 years back, and it seems to have become my "signature dish" :
5
We walked to Lagnaa from J8 Hotel in Little India. It was easy to find from our previous Google Map search and print out we took with us. We were warmly welcomed and and led upstairs to a quiet area where tables and cushions on the floor are standard. The waiter told us what was the most popular and we ordered Butter Chicken, Garlic Naan and Mango Lassi. Delicious
4
Hidden in the alley of little india, Lagnaa is one of the best restaurants to patronise, firstly for their great service and the way that handle their food. Owner cum chef would ask how spicy you like your dishes to be, and also not forgetting to recommend dishes appropriate for individuals. Walked past this restaurant around 2pm and decided to stop for a light snack. Snacks were great, tapas style and not too heavy. However not the cheapest place to have snacks, but definitely worth a visit if you have time
1
We were persuaded to visit Lagnaa by the extremely favorable reviews on TripAdvisor. The waiter explained their levels of spice for their dishes and the waiting time as dishes were freshly prepared when ordered. We ordered the Chicken entree, as recommended, to gauge how spicy we would like the remainder of our choices to be. However the waiter insisted that we had to order our other choices at the same time. We found the food to be bland and tasteless. Perhaps if we could have had our entree as an entree and then been able to order, we might have had a different experience. Not much point offering an entree which arrived well after the other dishes were served. Despite being assured that serving sizes would be ample for three adults we found they would really only serve one adult reasonably, particularly the rice. We also thought the prices charged were absolutely outrageous for the poor quality food and service received.Quite honestly I felt that some of the Indian stalls in the food courts came up with a vastly better quality, far more tasty and inviting product. I bitterly regret that we wasted a precious night on what can only be considered one of the worst dining experiences ever
5
Was recommended by fellow old boys to try out barefoot dining experience at Lagnaa for our catch up session! We were informed by the Lagnaa team of the full booking on that day and boy how packed the place was!!Our food was freshly cooked once we reached and was trying the level 1 and 1.5 curry as recommended. The overall taste was delicious and forgiving to the tongue for those who cant eat very spicy food are highly recommended to start from level 1.Enjoyed my dinner there, great ambiance accompanied with awesome company! I will definitely be back for another try at the level 2 and 3
5
We were introduced to Lagnaa by some friends two years ago and ever since have been back almost Every other month!!A couple of things about this place... Firstly, the chef K7is super passionate about his food and makes some of the best Indian I have tasted outside of India. He also boasts the secret to making incredibly calculated spicy food which he can dial up or down to your tastes! Great for both spice and non-spice fans.. We often end up having him sit with us and talk to us about his food.. His passion for his craft is very apparent.Secondly, the staff. They make you feel more like family than a customer. A rare find in Singapore. Enough saidThirdly.... The spice. Make sure you get your name on the wall of honour for spice eating. You are awarded a peg for each level of spice you achieve. And for those who like it hotter than is possibly humanly tolerable, a full moon chilli challenge evening will allow you to test your limits with spice intensity...Finally, this is just a great place to eat. Quirky and cheeky, with lots of personality and oozing with character..Please go and enjoy... Suitable for family, friends, couples and small casual business dinners. Make sure to sit outside and enjoy the warm weather and people walking by.
4
Quality of food is really good and authentic Indian taste. We had good time dinning at this place. Only minus point is service is bit slow.
5
Delicious curry. From level 1 to 6 the flavors are spot on, and above expectation. K7, Shanti, and the Lagnaa Team make for a great dinner experience. Perfect place for couples or small groups. If there is a little bit of a wait for your food, it is well worth the wait! If you are brave enough to try the level 6 then prepare for a delicious and flavorful experience.
4
During my recent 2 day stopover in Singapore, a friend persuaded me to see the authentic traditional side of the city and to take in some of the ethnic experiences...We visited Lagnaa in Little India...we did the seated downstairs experience rather than barefoot upstairs....either way would have been delightful.Our table was located below the "chilli level" heat scale...starting with "not hot(anyone can)" going up to level 10..."we declare you (king)".We started with a mild chicken starter to test our "heat capacity"...this was mild by my taste..and I then decided to select the lamb marsala as a main course...my regret was that I got talked into a a fairly mild heat level..anyway it was nevertheless well prepared and delicious..The restaurant ambience and location reminded me of previous visits to Chennai in India...a bombardment on your senses from the sounds, aromas, colours and humidity..the hustle and bustle of the crowds jostling to be in front...Worth a return visit
5
When a place serves amazing food in a cozy atmosphere, service is efficient and the staff friendly and kind, the only missing proof you need to recommend it is to visit it again and again, bringing new friends every time.Last time was my third dinner at Lagnaa. The spiciness competition is a challenge I can't stand (I'm practicing to reach the 3rd level..on a scale of 5 for humans, on a real scale of 10 for heroes), but I truly love the variety of choice, the always wise advice of the staff and the relaxed feeling of dining barefoot sitting on the floor.I'd recommend to make a reservation to be sure to enjoy this great food experience
5
I've discovered Lagnaa years ago when wandering past and have been back many times since. It is reliably a great evening out, a wonderful vibe and Shanti and the team really look after their guests and make sure you order the right combination of things. I am able to eat very spicy and can eat a number 5 with relative ease but I enjoy spice lever 3 the most. I've always liked their monthly menu and last week we finally had a chance to find out how it comes about by being part of their food tasting. We tasted 10 very different dishes and all gave a vote, the top 3 will be on the May menu. We had so much fun at the food tasting and have decided to make Lagnaa our number 1 go-to-Indian
5
Singapore has no shortage of Indian restaurants but Lagnaa barefoot dining stands a class above most. Whether you sit downstairs and watch the cooks at work while viewing the pegs of the spice challenge contestants on the wall- or you sit upstairs on the floor (in the aircon), each gives a great experience. The owner and head chef - "K7" takes pride in his dishes and in ensuing his staff of cooks are always striving for a better dish. They run tasting challenges each month (where we have been fortunate to be selected as taste testers) and this really showcases the creativity of the cooks and the love of flavour and mixing things up. You can tell when tasting the meals that the curries are made fresh and the bases are all cooked from scratch. The paneer is house made, the butter chicken is outstanding (the method in how it's put together can be shared in a cooking class) and the garnishes / additions in each meal are amazing. We've never had a bad dish! To top it off the the wait staff are the cooks and they are managed by the lovely, open and warm Shanti. Visiting Lagnaa is like visiting family. We cannot recommend it enough
5
This is without doubt some of the best Indian contemporary cuisine in Singapore. The food is outstanding and they have chilli ratings from 1 to 10. They will only let customers go up to No 6 usually but I can say that if you go over 3 you will not necessarily get the full enjoyment o fhte beautifully prepared dishes. The Butter Chicken is just melt-in-the-mouth delicious. The Fish Head curry is worth the wait and even the Mutton Masala at Level No 4 was delicious, the mutton was beautifully flavored and intensely hot without losing the original flavor of the lamb.Great ice cold beers and other cold drinks.Excellent staff with great food recommendations.Definitely worth a visit for a quirky Indian meal in Little India, Singapor
5
We still have full bellies while I write this. Without expecting anything we went into this tiny place and felt welcomed before we took a seat. The menu is overwhelming, but is was no problem I didn't know what to choose since one of the lovely owners helped us to make decisions in the most helpful way. And it tasted more than good!!! After we finished we had heartwarming discussions with the owners about food, what it means to eat in balance and about life in general :) if I would live in Singapore this would soon turn into my second home :) thank you so much Laagna! Kim & Davi
5
I thoroughly enjoyed visiting this place night after night. The did was terrific, there was plenty on the menu to try on different night, if your one for spice go as high as you like.The staff really shine and there is no doubt why this place is so high ranking. When your there meet the chief, the owner, the cooks and the hostesses. Every one is so friendly it's like you stepped into some ones own home.This was my home while away from home while I was in Singapore, so I invite you to try the same
5
Great service from all the staff, who are all very informative on the dishes being sold. The owners take time to make you feel at home. The service was great and the food delicious.I tried the level three curry which was smokey and honeyed in taste, this also got me onto the bottom rung of the spice ladder with my own peg. If you like good spicy or even good , tasty mild curry and want an easy ambience to your dining, with a feel of mothers (grandmothers) kitchen table then this is certainly a place you should try.As Arnie said on numerous occasions "I'll be back...
5
We had lunch here quite by chance not having read the reviews. It was one of the best Indian meals I have had outside of India! We sat upstairs and asked for recommendations for food. Our waitress explained all the food and the chilli test...we opted for a 3 but could have gone to a 4 at least.The food was beautiful, service great and we felt like family. The chef even took us into the kitchen to explain some of the dishes.If you are in Little India you must go and if your not there make the trip - sooo worth it
4
I heard about Lagna as a Kulfi Bar, so I was curious to try. I was with my family from Bruxelles visiting Little India and every body were very enjoyed to stopped at Lagna.The service was very friendly and give you suggestions for the level of spice.The room upstair is very quiet and relaxing (seating on the floor). After several hours of visit of Little India, it is very appreciating!! We didn't try too much things but the different variety of Nan was amazing, the butter chicken and the Palak Panneer (if I remember well the name) were delicious. And the Pistachios Kulfi... HummI've definitely found my favorite place to eat in Little India and I'm looking forward to visit Lagna very soon in order to try new dish!!

I really loved eating at this place. Had the chefs special fish curry and it was one of the best curries I've ever eaten. Actually better than many meals I've had in India. The staff is friendlier than you can imagine. Would love to go back

We went to Bare foot dining attracted by the idea of experiencing exotic food in a relaxed atmosphere, sitting on the floor. We were not disappointed. We had a very good time, the staff is really welcoming and funny, and we really appreciated all the food we tasted, full of flavor and which can be not too spicy if you follow the advises! I don't know if it's a real taste of India but it's become our favourite Indian restaurant in Singapore

Went to Lagnaa because of the high rating on TripAdvisor..The atmosphere is nice upstairs where you sit barefoot on the floor with Indian music playing in the background. But the food is terribly boring! So disappointed! We ordered two vegetarian dishes and a chili chicken starter. Tasted like the stuff you can get in a jar from the supermarket.If you're hungry you'll probably need 2 dishes per person and you'll land around 50$ per head. Not worth it.

Well what a great little find we have here, we've been to lots of so-called Indian restaurants this one in our opinion is well worth experiencing, great hospitality, good food and great experience. Not the easiest to find deep in the heart of little India but thoroughly recommended, keep it up don't change
5
Picture this: it's earth night and this restaurant joined this great initiative. Good food, you can pick your own spice level. Wonderfull depth of flavor in their curries.....candlelight. It doesn't get any more romantic in little India

Was introduced to this wonderful little restaurant in Little India about a year ago. Friends working in Singapore invited me to a Lagnaa cooking class as it was my birthday. It was a totally fun experience. Cooked my dinner and wrote a review at that time. Recently visited Singapore and went to the Lagnaa with a colleague from the National University of Singapore. Tried a variety of dishes and we both agree that the food was without equal - a totally wonderful dining experience
5
This place is great! The owner and hostess are both so interesting and welcoming, and the food was amazing (I recommend the samosas and the iced masala tea!). The chilli rating system with a peg on the wall for anyone that eats a 3 or above and getting to write on the walls was also lots of fun. Our dinner was really memorable and we'll definitely be back
5
The greeting on arrival was excellent, so friendly and prepared to sit down and explain the format of the menu and restaurant. The food was the best tasting Indian I have ever eaten, so good I returned two nights later for another feast. The Indian beer was also special "Godfather" who could ever go past that. The levels of intensity range from 1 to 10, the first nnight ate at level 3 and the next time around ate at level 6 and accomplished the meal on my own so placed my name up on the wall. Will return again and hopefully achieve a higher level
5
We were wandering past and went in thinking it was a bit different. Seating upstairs was bare foot and sitting on cushions on the floor seated at low tables. The staff were really friendly and we asked them to bring us food that they recommended for the 5 of us. The starters were great and the selection of curries were really tasty. They do spiciness on 7 levels. We went for level 3 as we wanted to be able to enjoy the food without coming out in a sweat. Would go back for sure and highly recommend

Was searching for a really good Indian in Singapore and I definitely found the perfect place! If I get the chance I will definitely make a second visit this trip and increase my spice level, maybe a 7 next time?! I can do it! The service was super friendly - was really made to feel at home and everyone made it an experience not to forget. The food was absolutely delicious- best Indian food I've had in a while and this is one of my favourite types of food. This is a restaurant in Singapore which is definately not to be missed! Can't wait to get back

Is not the first time and won't be the last, I'm sure.Discovered by chance, is now one of my reference point when I wanna eat Indian food. The service is good and the quality is over the average. Friendly, kind and well prepared personnel is ready to give you the right advice on what are your requests. Definitively VERY GOOD....I Forgot: they are organizing kitchen lessons. What do you want more

Found this wonderful little place by following the footsteps on the payment from Serangoon Rd (Little India one MRT stop from Clarke Quay) and was not disappointed. Lovely quaint setting on the street side with choice to eat al fresco or upstairs (no shoes). The service was informative and with a smaule as she explained how the spice system worked and we used the chilli chicken taster as a base (1.5 on the scale). We had the fish tikka starter which was tasty and succulent then I had a level 3 mutton masala. Level 3 would be too punchy for most of my friends I think but was a perfect heat. Will be trying 4 next week! My friends had level 2 chicken masalas which still had a lot of warmth and heat so don't get too ambitious! All the food was beautiful, spicy and rich. The naan breads were good too. Also on offer was a range of well priced strong Indian lagers. Had a great night, will definitely return. Highly recommended if you are hunting for an excellent well priced cut in the streets of Little India
5
This an an excellent off the beaten path restaurant in Little India. The service was outstanding and the staff made great recommendations. The food can be made spicy, but we also had dishes that were mild enough to be shared by all. We sat on the sidewalk which made for great people watching. Its down a side street, so the experience is very street-like. You can get less expensive food in Little India, but we felt the value was good. It is informal, and we ended up conversing with other diners. If you have only one meal in Little India, I would check this place out
5
A fantastic restaurant with a wonderful owner - try the chili challenge if you dare! We played it safe at 2 but try the 3 for a peg on the wall. Highly recommended
5
We frequent Lagnaa on a regular basis as a business group and as individuals with friends and visitors. We always have a great time with very good service and Indian food that cannot be matched in taste and price point. There simply aren't any dishes that will disappoint. And, new ones all the time. For the adventurous there is the Chili challenge that brings out pre-meal bravado and post meal bragging - or humble admissions of defeat. Definitely a show to watch.K7 and staff provide a wonderful evening of "barefoot dining" in the heart of Little India. A strong recommendation to give them a try
5
This cooking lesson was a hands on one where were told how to rectify mistakes made in the cooking We cooked our own butter chicken with the help of the master chef and many tips were given as we cooked our dish.Different from other cooking lessons where the master chef does the cooking and we just watch and ask a few questions.Enjoyed the lesson Thanks master chef

I would like to extend our sincere thanks to Lagnna's Shanti and her team for making this party a success and everyone had a great time enjoying the food and company. Shanti and team made us feel comfortable and they never fail us everytime I'm having a meal there with their superb service and friendliness.Kudos to Shanti and team of Lagnna.Veronic

Went there with my husband on the basis of good reviews but were disappointed. Our experience mirrors grumbles from other posters who have left unflattering reviews. In short we found the food (but not service) not really up to scratch, and the meal expensive (compared to others locally). Shortcomings for us included a dry naan, vegetable curry with no vegetables ( just gravy with a small separate ramekin of past their best crudités) and cuts of chicken which seemingly had very little meat (but lots of skin and fat). Overall this restaurant was just not for us - we didn't enjoy the meal at all and could not recommend the restaurant to others.
5
This place has been a favourite with friends and family for over 5 years. The staff are always really friendly and helpful and go out of their way to make it a fun night! They've even let my son cook the Naan bread on his birthday which was a highlight! Also a great plce for overseas guests.

Noticed this little gem during a guided tour and I came back for lunch. I was on my own but with such a warm welcome, I felt immediately at home. Chart suggested level of chilli from one to ten, but I admitted I was really a minus one. It was not a problem and after discussing the menu, the waitress suggested butter chicken. The subtle flavours were absolutely delicious and the staff eating on another table sent across a sample of what they were having. Yum, Yum.Quirky, authentic and great value for money. Thanks so much. I`ll be back on my next trip

I have been eating at Lagnaa for over six years now and all I can say is that there is always that new dish on the monthly special which just simply delights the taste buds but that is not the only reason I keep going back its the people , staff and the chefs which really make your dining experience something to remember they are all just so welcoming and friendly to the point that after the second visit you think you have known them for years.The atmosphere is just fantastic form sitting outside in the cool breeze and absorbing the living mosaic of Singapore's Little India to sitting downstairs inside with the action and smells of the kitchen or just stairs in air-condition conform sitting on soft cushions on the floor.They are always happy to explain the meal , the history of food and the spices and suggest drinks to suit the tastes. The head Chef is a true experimental chef and loves to create new flavours or bring back old traditional Indian dishes long forgotten or every served in main stream restaurant's.If you every get time I would also really suggest you book into a Saturday morning cooking class so you can not only learn how to make a meal but understand why and how the ingredients compliment each other.The one thing you will always get is a friendly smile with lots of good Humour.K7 you have a great team who all care about food and people you should be proud of what you have achieved as it not just about eating food its about the experience

I, together with my friends visited this restaurant. We were greeted by a pleasant lady whom we were told the Manager.We were led into the restaurant where we took our shoes off. That was a great relieve after all the long walk around Little India.The bare-foot dining experience was so unique. The ambience was simple and relaxing. We were briefed about the various chilli levels and was advised to do a spice check dish , Chilli Chicken before jumping into the spice level.Thank god, we did the spice check. Thereafter,we ordered, mix grill platter, veg pakora, mutton masala spice level 3 and palak paneer , Garlic Naans and Saffron Rice. Banana Lassi and Mango Lassi was lovely. The rice was fragrant and fluffy. Meat was tender and the masala was flavourful. The Service staffs were very friendly and attentive. We finished off the meal with Masala Tea which was owesome. I would highly recommend this restaurant
4
Enjoyed a lovely meal here, food is simply amazing the flavours are delicious. The staff are friendly and helpful and the service is great. There is a great atmosphere in the restaurant and all in all it was a fantastic experience. The only thing stopping me from giving a 5 is the portion sizes which we found to be rather small, I could have eaten 2 dishes easily
4
The food is very tasty, and the place is very clean. You can seat in traditional small Indians tables. People just have to be aware that it's a pricy place
5
My wife and I were taken to the restaurant by some friends (we were visitors from UK) who wanted us to share an experience. What an evening! Lovely food and a great atmosphere. Great service by Kumari, the manageress. We opted to eat on the pavement (under cover) rather than go upstairs: there are only two outside tables. Information was given about spice levels (1 to 9) and each dish is cooked accordingly. Good beer as well; there is no bar as such. We returned there on our own the next day for lunch and we were joined by Kaesavan (pronounced "K7"), the owner (and Kumari, in-between serving others). The conversation was lively and 2 hours flashed by. What a great place! Enjoy

Clean, very friendly service, delicious food. I agree with what most of the other reviewers have said. Yes, you can find much cheaper food at other restaurants in Little India . However it is all freshly prepared , you can discuss how spicy you want your food and what to order, plus there was a homely atmosphere.The portions were not very big but there was enough for the two of us. We had chilli chicken to start, then prawn masala, butter chicken, raita ( yogurt) and an aubergine dish as well as a portion of rice and naan. The naan was thin rather than the thicker type I'm used to.I would definitely go back
4
I have visited many Asian restaurants but this one is very different. One leaves shoes at the front door and goes up the stairs to a narrow room which has only low tables behind which you squat on the floor to eat The word authentic is used by most Asian restaurants but here it is very true Home cooking at its best, not to be confused with that of the myriad establishments that have sprung up in England.Innovative and amusing descriptions of spice levels and dishes add to the mood of this establishment.Previous subscribers to this site have somehow missed the magic.We would never have found this little gem without the recommendation of three Ladies that met us on a coach tour of New Zealand.The world indeed is a small plac

It must have been really unimpressive for me to take the time to write this. But really to have to pay 80 bucks for lousy food is a crime. Don't bother coming here. There's plenty of better options nearby for a lot less. Palak paneer tasteless. Dal makahni tasted nothing like it should have nor did the butter chicken. The quality of the food and the portion size was not worth the money they charged. And simply throwing a bit of spice in at the end does not equate to anything worth eating
4
Was a incredible surprise the prawl curry... Delicious!! The taste was super. Its a local restaurant in the indian neighborhood.
I really recomend!
4
I love this restaurant, the food and the staff! Have been several times, and it's consistently good.
3
We went there for our new year lunch expecting it to be very good after reading some reviews, but the food turned out to be average only. The starters were good especially ivy gourd fry(kovakkai poriyal) and mango lassi. Then we ordered Veg Jalfreezi(spicy level 2) and Panner Butter Masala and some breads. Breads and Panneer Masala were good but Jalfreezi was too spicy(it was just raw chilli powder and tasteless). But the Chef was too kind to change the Gravy but even that too was not tasty. Overall it was average food and too expensive for the ambience and food
4
Thanks to TripAdvisory to find this great place. Spice level "system" is funny and working well. Even level 2 was enough for us. :) Nice spot
3
I had the mutton masala and dhal and both were very good. Was talked into ordering the beer on special, Godfather, only to discover it was over 7% and not very drinkable. Asked for some iced water and was told to help myself upstairs and pour myself one from a warm plastic drum. Ok, not convenient, but the next person to ask was handed a glass with ice and water. 4* food, 2* servic
5
This is possibly the best restaurant in the world. The staff are incredibly friendly. The food is unbelievably delicious. The atmosphere is homely. Everything about this restaurant is incredible. We stayed in Singapore for 3 nights and ate there 3 times. Highly recommended!!!!

We are currently working in Singapore, one of the guys had visited this place a few years ago and recommended in.we had 6 guys in our group all challenging each other to go as high as they could on the spice level the restaurant is located in little India, you can eat upstairs and you sit on the floor very traditional or sit on the the ground floor normal table etc.the service is top class and the food is very good you pick the level of spice from 1 -10 on first visit you can only go to 6 and this is hotter than every curry in the UK out of our group only 1 guy finished a level 6 and one finished a level 5 I would recommend this place food is great and prices are bette
4
Went to this restaurant on Sunday 30 Nov with my friend, and i must say that the barefoot dining place is good. The food is really tasty and we opted to go for level 6 for the food that we ordered. Wow it was not only spicy but the food is good too.The lady who attended to us was nice and recommended good food. The only comment i have is that they could have improve better on the Cheese Naan as i couldn't really taste the cheese.. Overall go for the level 2 on the floor sitting instead of level 1 (normal sitting chair)We had a blast with the food and our stomach was burning from the food, will definitely return to go for level 12
4
We enjoyed our evening at Lagnaa, we sat outside and the atmosphere was good greatly assisted by the cheeriness of the staff, general affability and excellent service.The food is certainly not cheap, nor is the alcohol, we drank a 'bucket' of lager, two vodka tonics and two gin and tonics. We chose starters and the three specials for main course with rice etc, it was delicious, not especially plentiful but we all agreed that we were full and very satisfied.With more drinks and extras the total bill amounted to 248 SD for three adults, a very good night out and hugely entertaining
5
Little India can be overwhelming but you won't go wrong if you make your way to Lagnaa's. Delicious food, made exactly the way you like it, and the service is wonderful. Do yourself a favour
5
What a great place! Great atmosphere and the staff are amazing!
Best Indian food I have had in a long time and very great value! Would highly recommend.
5
I am in love with this place! The service is easily of the best in Singapore â€“ they sit down and guide you through the menu and spice levels. Last time we also had a visit from the chef asking if we enjoyed the food; which of course, we did! The atmosphere upstairs is great; I always take visiting friends and family here because of the unique experience it offers. Definitely five stars. Tip: Go for level 2 if you like spicy, go for level 3 if you like to sweat
4
An honest, reasonable priced, no frills curry house in the heart of Little India. The service was warm, fun and informative. The food delicious and the perfect size. The heat of the curry your choice from 1-10, people rarely reach anything above 5! Wonderful little place, a real gem
5
I must say that service here is excellent, from everybody at Langnaa. I had the amazing opportunity to meet K7, Kumari and Chanti. They are the warmest and friendliest people, they approach you, chat with you, make sure you are okay. They cook, serve and manage the restaurant together. Even the waiters in the back are very service minded, giving this place a very comfortable dining ambiance.I really underestimated the spice challenge they have, but if you are up to it, give it a try. They rank from 1-10, I had a 6 and could not finish it. It was however a fun experience especially taking the time to talk to the staff. Taking the challenge, you cannot have any drinks such as a lassi or milk to assist you which makes the challenge even more challenging. (No one has finished level 10, only one guy has finished level 9 in the past 8 years). I caution however if you take the challenge that it will probably deter your experience in appreciating the quality of food. Once you are at the level of 6 or above, it's a fight to finish the dish and mind over matter, so you will not be able to appreciate the quality of food at all. As a result, I cannot give my full opinion on how good the food was, however the mango lassi was really delicious when I was not able to finish the curry.When I return to Singapore, I feel obliged to come back here simply because the staff are so warm and caring. I also am excited to come back in to trying the food out of the challenge so I can appreciate it. Food is slightly expensive in my opinion however food in Singapore is generally expensive so you make your own judgement.Even though I cannot address to the quality of the food (since I did the challenge), I am confident to say you can just come here for the warm and excellent service. Drinks are good.Thank you is much K7, Kumari and Chanti

Walked past this place twice before almost giving up. My colleague even asked someone who just returned a blank stare. Then he spotted a signboard which said we were only 50 steps away! On the footpath were 'footprints' which we followed dutifully and after a misstep, arrived at a staircase with footwear on it. Ah, so that's why it's called barefoot dining.Up we went. Now, I'm not the most flexible guy at 6' with long legs. My colleague was from India so sitting on the floor to eat was nothing new to him. Cross legged ended for me after primary school.Ordered the chilli chicken starter and a lamb and chicken main, with rice, some roti and an old monk beer.On enquiring what heat we wanted the main to be, the waiter suggested we advise him after 'testing our heat rating' on the chilli chicken, which we were told was '1.5'.Coped with that OK, so went for 2.5 on the main , only to be told there are no .5's. Ummm....so we went with 3, which was hot enough to bring on my hiccups but perfect compliment to my Old Monk.Servings were ample as we were not bake to finish it all. 4* because I noted on ordering my second beer, that the first was past it's best by date...( after having drank it ). This was highlighted to the waiter. No discount given or replacement foc offered.Still , it's far better than the standard fare they dish up nowadays at the Banana Leaf Tourist Trap, and I recommend it. I don't recall any a/c in the upstairs room.You pay downstairs, where there are also tables and some out front; not sure who eats there. Take a look on the wall down here before heading upstairs for dinner - there is a heat scoreboard alongside which are long stringlines most of which are full of washing line pegs. I believe you can have your name added to a peg to attest to the heat score you achieved. Be warned, the scoreboard rates 9 as the highest. The closest anyone has achieved is 8. I eat pepper, and I reckon 4 would be a challenge for me. Now there's a challenge for you!Give them call and ask about any special events they have organized when making a booking, you might get lucky

The absence of Indian patrons in a restaurant in Little India should have sounded warning bells. But we were charmed by the enthusiastic staff and the quirky decor. You learn quickly enough that this place is geared towards the unsuspecting tourist, with one of the restaurant walls plastered with scribblings of happy, contented past patrons (who probably couldn't tell a papadum from a paratha), staff who recite the same gimmicky lines about the 'hotness' challenge to guests and its Tripadvisor Best Restaurant 2013 award (for what?) proudly and prominently on display. We should've known better, having been living in Singapore for the past 2 years. The dishes which we ordered (either among the chef's recommendations or on the special menu) were truly disappointing. It wasn't anything like the superb grub you'd get in just about any restaurant in the areaThe flavours just felt wrong. I can't put my finger on what exactly was wrong with the food. We felt even more wronged when we got the bill which was double the price we'd pay in any good restaurant in Little India. I'm still reeling in shock by the bill as will our friends when we tell them. To be fair the service was warm and friendly and restaurant experience was pleasant and 'different' to the stock standard but for the price and the quality (any true blue Indian would've been appalled) - I'd recommend anyone to go elsewhere. You'd get better value and a taste of what real Indian food should be
4
Really friendly restuarant in the heart of Little India don't be put off by the back street and the number of people...this was one of the best experiences of Singapore. The food is excellent and against the backdrop of the general cost of living it was good value for money. I would recommend to anyone if you just wanted to do something a bit different for a night in Singapore. One tip if you dine upstairs and sit on the floor it's air conditioned downstairs isn'
4
We enjoyed the food, especially the mutton massala, chicken tikka & yoghurt rice. We just regret the portions were a bit small
4
Food was very good and the owners were great! A small, great spot in Little India. And if you are a fan of spicy food, then you must take the spice challenge (and this is serious stuff). I completed the level 6 this Friday and it was very nice. I now look forward to clearing level 7 in the Nov full moon, where you can go all the way to level 10 after you qualify with level 6 (which in itself is enough to send most people home crying). Definitely a place worth checking out - whether you are a spicy fan or not, you will not be disappointed
5
We visited last Saturday for a small family celebration for my husband's birthday. Made reservations in advance and communicated particulars on the special event in email. The restaurant personnel were extremely responsive in confirming details and met expectations to a tee! Food was outstanding, spice according to the patron's level, and service outstanding. Sat upstairs and glad we had a reservation as when we arrived, downstairs was completely full and when we left....the restaurant was packed. Will go again...a new favorite restaurant in Singapore
5
The food at Lagnaa is the best Indian I have ever had. Good Indian food served, warm and hospitable staff. A nice place to take your friends who love Indian food.
5
Went here on Friday with a colleague and had an excellent meal, very tasty good beer (Godfather Strong) and very friendly service, will visit again and highly recommend
5
Revisited Lagnaa to take on their level six chili challenge! All their dishes are tasty. I love that smooth buttery texture of their butter chicken. It is made to perfection. The chicken masala of chili scale six would send you into space!! Take on the challenge if you are game for it. I enjoy the ambiance whether it's on the cushion barefooted or on the chair by lots of wall scribbles from diners. People at Lagnaa are friendly too, had a good conversation on chili and spicy cuisine. Worth dropping by for a yummy meal in a cozy environment
5
We ate here earlier tonight having reading the reviews and all the good stuff is true!!A light starter at 1.5 on their chili scale was delicious so I went Chicken Tikka Masala....a bit of a wimp out but with a 2 on the chili scale, what could go wrong? Flipping heck that .5 was a hell of a difference....fantastic flavours though and with the ghee fried jeera rice and the garlic naan and Mrs Cheffy had Paneer butter masala which had no spice to speak of.Not the largest menu just what they do is very very good but whoever orders above a 6 on the scale is not of this world!!$100 sgd for two including 4 beer
4
My brother, who lives in Singapore, took me here on my visit as it is his favourite indian. It was a nice, small, intimate restaurant where we sat on cushions on the floor, upstairs.If you pick the 'chicken curry' you choose your spice level from 1 to 10, i went for a 3 and it was delicious but already pretty spicy!We had the monthly special to start, some prawns, which were delicious, and shared some paneer and spinach and aloo gobi with our mains. All delicious and good value
5
We had dinner here last night . we both love indian cuisine and this was one of the best indian meals we have had -the naan bread was out of this world. Everything freshly cooked and topped off with delicious Godfather beer. The staff could not have been nicer. Also loved the ambience. Will definitely go back
4
Had dinner here after reading about it online. The staff are very, very friendly and helpful. Before even settling down at our table we were given a basket of poppadums! The menu is not extensive but this turned out to mean what is done is done well! If you like spice there is a scale displayed on the wall. We opted for level 3 and that was sufficient! Can't imagine more! The food came quickly and was very good.
5
This was the second time is been to Lagnaa and this time I brought my sister. We had the number 4 curry and a gorgeous cold Godfather beer. Shanti our waitress was really lovely and after telling her it was my birthday she came out with the chefs and gave me a fabulous rich chocolate dessert with a candle and sang happy birthday! I'll be back to challenge my Brother-in-law to eat a higher number on the chilli-ometer
5
Knowing very little before we went, my husband and I visited Lagnaa for dinner on Friday and were immediately charmed by the warm welcome, personal service and relaxing environment. We opted for the barefoot dining upstairs, and despite being rather less limber (!) than other diners, managed to negotiate the floor cushions and low tables without difficulty. The food was excellent, and helpfully introduced by the hostess (Shanti) via their witty menu (which does bear a good read, as it's deliberately tongue-in-cheek). You have a starter dish to gauge the level of spice you feel comfortable with, and then choose the rest of the food from there. We also decided to try the Indian red wine, and loved it - quite a surprise, but definitely one to repeat. Thank you, Lagnaa. We will be back ..
4
I visited Lagnaa for a solo dinner after reading about it on Lonely Planet. Although I didn't venture upstairs to the barefoot dining room (my bad), the atmosphere downstairs was just fine. Service was pleasant, not rushed - better than most I had in Singapore during the two months I was there. The food was outstanding. I highly recommend the upara rice, first of all - I've not had anything like it in Indian cuisine before and it was worth it. Everything tasted fresh and the blend of spices was really enjoyable. Great spot for a chill evening with friends or a good date night
5
Excellent waiting staff, reasonable price for a delicious spread of dishes and a wonderful unique dining experience. I'll definately return here soon!
4
My partner and I were looking for somewhere good to eat that wouldn't break the bank and we searched google and this place was highly rated, and with all right! Amazing food, great service. The little India area can feel a bit rough but just embrace it an enjoy the evening!

This restaurant in Little India was right near my hotel, but did involve walking through what seemed like dodgy areas of town. But since everyone told me Singapore is super safe, I didn’t worry (too much) about roaming around Little India as a solo traveler. The restaurant itself has a small intimate downstairs space. It has a good sized menu with all the Indian favorites I like, as well as some I hadn’t tried before. I had the Aloo Gobi and the Chicken Tikka Masala, rice and naan. They ask you to choose your spice level from a chart on the wall (1 = not at all spicy, 10= I Dare You!). I would say I like spicy food, but apparently I don’t even know what spicy is. I went with level 2 and it was just about the spiciest food I’ve ever had. It was delicious, but definitely spicy (as in mouth on fire). Be forewarned. That said, I enjoyed the meal very much and would recommend the place
4
We were told by a good friend to visit this place whilst in Singapore so we did. The food is quiet good and you can ask for a level of chili to suit your desired taste. Unfortunately, I had to go with the majority decision and had to opt for a lower level than i would have liked. I don't like taking my shoes off to visit places whilst travelling so we ate downstairs! We were well looked after by the manageress, Shanti, and the meals were very good but didn't quite match what we'd been led to expect. Prices were a little high compared with the local markets but that's what you pay if you want the extra atmosphere
1
This place is a rip off, even by Singapore standards. Portions are for birds, the taste is mediocre, the prices are a rip off. With a glut of Indian restaurants in the area, the only reason this place still survives is due to the gullible patrons that characterize much of Singapore. I also saw a number of westerners there, who probably are turned on by cheap gimmicks/novelty employed by the restaurant like eating bare-foot to give it return business. Bad. Do not go
5
I've been to Lagnaa on previous occasions with my other half and with family, friends, and work colleagues and enjoyed it every time both upstairs (barefoot style) and downstairs (normal seating). The food is always very good and the spice level selection adds a fun twist, or a challenge if you like!This time was the first time I was invited to the monthly tasting evening where patrons taste-test many dishes before voting for their favourites. The dishes with the most votes are added to the specials for the following month. I can honestly out of all the dishes I tried, I would eat every single one again.Besides the food, the service is great - really warm, friendly and welcoming. They are talkative and engaging and love to tell you what you want to know about the food. There is a laidback, homely feel to the place and the staff are used to a wide range of different customers. The kitchen can adapt most dishes to suit.The atmosphere on this night was really good. The other tasters were mostly couples too but everyone is seated together so you soon get to talk to the people around you. I'm sure it can vary but we luckily had a lovely group and had a real laugh.All in all, I would recommend Lagnaa without hesitation, whether for the tasting club or any other time
4
One of the most memorable meals we had in Singapore as a family. The service was great - catering for the little ones taste buds all the way up to those that like to spice it up. Friendly and quick - we'd definitely recommend

An unassuming but original restaurant with high quality food and service. There was a wide range of choice on the menu and the idea of choosing your level of spiciness is a good concept especially if you're up for the challenge

Took kids for the fun of barefoot dinning. Look it wasn't bad and for Singapore it was inexpensive. But the menu only hand a handful of dishes and all you did was increase the chilli. It's not what I would expect of an Indian. The whole barefoot thing just meant sitting on the floor. On the plus the owner was very friendly and helpful. But I wouldn't go out of my way to go there

I am a frequent visitor to Singapore and on one of my trips a couple of years ago I found the gem that was Lagnaa! Lagnaa is a wonderful restaurant with great tasting food! The atmosphere is incredibly warm and inviting and the staff there are so polite and friendly! Being a Sri Lankan, I am not usually the kind of person who eats indian food outside but who can resist Lagnaa's mouthwatering dishes??? My favourites are their Jeera rice and their masala tea! At first I was disappointed at their portions but I very quickly realized after my first meal there that the quality of the food was excellent and while the portions seemed small, their food was so filling! I am going to blame the Lagnaa team for most of the weight I have put on over the last couple of years ;

Friends living in Singapore took us here for a meal, and I really loved it. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and the quirky levels of spiciness with the option to chose what you can handle adds a different angle to the eating experience! Especially if this appeals to any competitive curry lovers in your party. I love the ambiance in the barefoot level upstairs (leave your shoes at the bottom of the stairs), I found the low tables and sitting on the floor arrangement really helped with the relaxed atmosphere - although my 6'4" boyfriend struggled to get comfortable!The menu isn't huge, but didn't need to be, we left feeling satisfied, happy, keen to return and proud to leave a 'level 4' peg with our name on it on the wall

I just remember my honeymoon visit to singapore and how i insist on having my launch at lagna ,(we miss it ).spending more than hour searching for the resturant ....we really like the food it was exellent ..it was worthy to spend time searching for it . . We hope to visit singapore and eat at lagna again soon 
5
I went to Lagnaa with my friend first, she has been there before and was harping about it for a while until I finally went there. I got to say Iâ€™m not much of a vege person but the palak paneer was nice and it made me salivate just by smelling it, plus I had it with the gageree rice which was extremely good. And as mention off course I had to have some meat so I got the mutton masala which was another stunner. The whole dining experience became a huge mouth-watering evening
5
Amazing ambience at level 2, soothing, relaxing and calming! Food was flavourful and colourful! Our kiddos were fascinated by the presentation. We were so well taken care off, as staffs possessed an extremely positive attitude. They were so warm and welcoming. I can't say enough of all the goodness we received from you. Thank you so much for making our lunch a memorable ones
5
What a great find. Barefoot dining sitting on the floor upstairs, normal table and chairs downstairs. The owner and all staff were so welcoming. They give you a spice taste tester so that you can gauge and order food only as spicy as you want it - great if you're not sure how hot you want it.We've eaten hundreds of curries in several countries and can honestly say this is up there in the top three. Great quality at a reasonable price, I'd recommend it to anyone.Peter

On the recommendation of a colleague - I brought some friends to this place. The food, the service and the general atmosphere was wonderful. The staff were very friendly and took the time to get to know us and tailored the meal to our preferences. The food is freshly prepared and was delicious. We will be going back for more.
5
You know you've stepped into a magical place when you first see the walls of Lagnaa...Barefoot Dining restaurant. The messages on the walls are testaments of the quality of the food, the professionalism of the staff and the general atmosphere of the restaurant! The mango lassi here is the best I have ever tasted!!! :

I came here with an overseas client and our families. This Restaurant is very unique as it was my first barefoot dining experience with genuine service and customer interactions. There was a variety of Indian food with exceptional quality and even has Chilli Levels. It has a friendly and warm environment with an unparalleled Indian cuisine. The service was friendly with an understanding dietary requirement as I'm lactose intolerant. It was so much fun I even signed up for the cooking class, food and wine tasting. I would highly recommend this place to everyone and hope you enjoy it as passionately as I did

Very highly priced for crap food quality and very less quantity. Weird Service. Just there to make profit and not as promised as serving homely/good food as put on its website. I visited restaurant based on reviews. If you know what Indian food in India is like, would not advise you ever to go to Lagnaa. Where to start from, there is nothing Indian about it. I always expect if Indian restaurant ( moreover they claim we are homely) that water be served on arrival. One may order drinks or not, its irrelevant. There is no water on arrival. Its Self-Service. Then the waiter is too much into your face, rushing you with choices. We sat on ground floor which has appalling ambience and its cramped. The waiter did not even arrange the table so we could sit properly in that cramped place inspite of asking. Instead we were asked to arrange our table by ourselves. We were not even allowed to sit on neighboring empty table which was less cramped and non-reserved. We had decided to have vegetarian. Were surprised to know its limited choices. The veges have real small portions ( hungry or not hungry), so does the rice and starter. For those small portions and quality the price is stupidly high. The veges tasted not at all as they should taste. The waiter recommended starters were burnt. I dont even know what non-veg food be like!! The only respite for me was drink which is not a specialty (sour-soup freezy) It has concept of spice levels, which is equally appalling. Any cuisine have some dishes that are spicy, some not. Ditto with Indian cuisine. They have separate dishes for different levels of spice. How's that different from other restaurants that simply mark spicy food on the menu. Perhaps, Lagnaa is designed more to cater Westerners or Locals as its generally observed that many of them find Indian cuisine spicy. For benefit to all folks wanting to try "spicy indian food" will not recommend Lagnaa. Perhaps, I may sound too over the line to some people, but this is one food experience, I want to forget. Being an Indian and appreciated for having very good food and dining sense, sorry thumbs down to bottom of the ground

We came here because of its rating on Trip Advisor and thoroughly enjoyed it. Authentic tasty Indian food. It's on the spicy side, so when you're asked to chose one of the three spice levels, suggest you err on the conservative. My favourite was the shish kebab and the chicken tikka.When we finished we mentioned that one of our dishes had a bitter taste. The chef came to see us and then invited us into the kitchen while he adjusted the salt and spice level before our eyes. It was such a treat and genuinely caring about delivering good food. To his word, the bitterness was gone. Who does that these days!! We would definitely come back.To the lady and the chef who served us, well done and thank you for great food and service tonight

After reading all the good reviews, we decided to try this place yesterday and was highly disappointed by the quality and quantity of food. The Good - unique bare foot seating concept in restaurant. Although this is very common in Indian household but seeing first time in a restaurant so gives a bit homely feel. Ambience was pretty relaxed and laid back.The bad - portion of food is very less. Bit pricy for the quantity. Bad tasting food.The ugly - we ordered chicken chilly and I did not even recognise it. First time seeing chicken chilly red coloured and sweet tasting with lot of tomatoes. $ 60 for 2 persons having light meal was bit expensive for me.Watch out - the lower seating does not have AC, so if u gonna pay the same price and sweat, better to sit upstairs if u comfortable setting on floor. Quantity is too less, so if u really hungry, don't go.I am an Indian and I swear by my mother land -THIS IS NOT AUTHENTIC INDIAN FOODThe place is full of tourist and foreigners and I conclude reviews are by them and for them. If you really Looking for authentic, quality, quantity, I am sure there are plenty options
4
We enjoyed our tasting of the month with Lagnaa, my Indian companion even went so far as to say she would try and make the same as the food was soooo good, but also unusual. High praise indeed from an Indian woman who cooks a lot
5
Passionate staff, great food, wonderful atmosphere. Highly recommended. This is a great option for a casual dining experience. Definitely coming back
4
Barefoot is not a bad place to eat. Unique as you can order your spices from 1 to 10. Apart from having messages scrawled on most of the available surfaces from happy diners it has a scoreboard along one wall from 1 to 10,needless to say nobody has been able to get through a dish rated 10 and only 1 person managed a 9. Whatever dish rating you get through gets you a peg and your name inscribed on the wall.You can order tasting dishes ad l advise to do this as it gives a good idea about what you will be comfortable with. Staff are great as is the chef who is the owner.Thought it was a bit pricey but that may have been the amount of beer we drunk, it is an unusual experience and well worth a visit
5
Judging by the hundreds friendly notes written in that restaurant's wall, it's not five but twenty stars that it deserves. Lagnaa is a little Indian restaurant hidden in Singapore's Little India, not too far from the mosque, at 6 Upper Dickson Road. It can sit approximately 20 customers. The food is excellent, the price more than affordable and the service all smile. Each time I'm in the Lion city, I dine there (butter chicken, naan and lassi for around S$20). There's a rich variety of dishes that are cooked with quite a range of chili content, so you have a zillion ways to feel your palate slightly challenged or literally disintegrated. Fear not, there's a firemen station around the corner.Anyway, this place is always a pleasure to come back to, and I highly recommend it
5
I came into the restaurant today with my family of 3 and we were warmly greeted by Shanti, ushered to our barefoot dining table and were introduced to the menu. All recommendations made were absolutely divine. The fish curry we had tasted like nothing I've ever had in sg before. Fish was fresh and the taste awoke my taste buds. Paired with their warm yoghurt rice, this combination is a must try. Will definitely return here to try their other items. -Raji
4
The concept of barefoot dining is interesting. A group of us went and we really enjoyed this unique experience. The service is great! Need to be prepared to wait for food thou. Overall we felt at home in the place thanks to the warm hospitality!
4
The food is very good don't get me wrong, but I still have had better Indian food and other restaurants. This place is still absolutely worth checking out because of its reputation and uniqueness! I would return absolutely and bring friends there too! The servers were charismatic and friendly and the spice level wall is an awesome idea.
5
I had a 'Singapore Six' here and have been searching for the same buzz ever since!There's not a lot else to say about Lagnaa, except - "GO HERE!"I met up with an old primary school buddy from London here and we had the best reunion we could have hoped for! Challenging each other to try the "six", I submitted and ordered a Vege Jalfrezi.Since Dhal Makhani is my favourite back home, I also had to try it here, so I added one of these to my order too. And some bread and Kingfisher beer. The staff were awesome and joined in with the hilarity as we awaited our soul-burning hot food, and more so once the chaos of eating it began!I wasn't allowed to touch the dhal while I attacked the 'six'. I began eating and burned up once. I swilled some beer, rubbed some bread on my tongue, then went back in. After a couple of burn-ups, I realised that I just needed to yam it down! So, that's what I did. I earned my peg, along with my old friend and we placed them proudly up on the Number Six wire.I then ate my dhal.The resultant buzz was like nothing I have felt in my life. I have been on a curry rampage of Auckland attempting to find a similar spice, but one that has the same flavours and taste as Lagnaa's special six. I haven't found one, despite ordering "Indian Hot plus 1" in a take away the other day.After the meal, the boss (K7?) joined us for a chat outside, while we finished our beers. Great chat and a truly great experience. Like no other restaurant experience I've ever had.Next time I am passing through Singapore, I will be back here to claim my place on the Number Seven rail

Great meal for party of 6. The food is terrific and the service just as good as we were taken care of by both Big Toe and Little Toe. We sat downstairs on the sidewalk table (rather than upstairs barefoot dining room). If you don't want to sit on the floor, ask to sit downstairs. We let the house choose the food for us, which they were keen to do. They also took the time to give us some small bites to gauge both our preferences and heat tolerance. For those who like heat, real heat, Lagnaa's got it
5
It was one real spicy treat that I had outside of India. The hostess at the restaurant is very engaging with the guests. The food, service and the ambiance, everything is spot-on.
5
Had a great meal with an old long lost friend a few weeks back.Was tempted into trying the 6/10 (heat/spice level) curry and O. M. G. it was hot, but still very very tasty. Building up the courage to go back for the 7/10.Awesome and very friendly service, would definitely go back and definitely recommend any one to try, although make sure you have no important meetings the next morning if you go over 5/10 on the spice levels!!!
4
Little India can be quite daunting if you do not have a restaurant recommendation - this was a lucky find. Caters for visitors but not in a touristy way. Great food- great value and very attentive staff. Good explanations about the spice levels -would definitely go back
5
We returned to Lagnaa after first visiting on a lay over around 3 years ago, how brilliant to see that the service, food and atmosphere are still the best in Little India - my boyfriend and I just got engaged and the staff made it such a special evening for us and really went out of their way to make our night unique, we can't thank you enough! We will be returning! This is a must visit if you are staying in Singapore, you will not be disappointed
5
Visited on a Saturday lunchtime. The food (butter chicken, naan bread, poppadoms and dips) was all delicious and tasted fresh. The staff were very knowledgeable about the food and the owner was around chatting to everyone. Great place and will definitely be back - the dip with the poppadoms alone is worth a return trip
5
I had a very pleasant early evening at Lagnaa. I was greeted by the owner K7 himself who really makes you feel welcome. I chose to eat at a pavement table but there are also tables 'inside' the open fronted downstairs and a fully air conditioned upstairs room where you sit barefoot on the floor at low tables. The food was excellent and you have a choice as to how hot they make your curry. K7 or any of the other staff are more than happy to discuss what your safe level may be
2
First the staff is friendly as lot Indian restaurants. The dining upstairs is nice to eat on the floor, the one downstairs is looking like a foodcourt.unfortunately the food was not as good as expected, the vegi and specials dumplings were average and the meat ordered was with lot of sauce with no much meat.The main courses based on vegetables were saucy without no specific taste.The worst was the red wine from Chile which was not good at all.The staff is very good in marketing, with tripadvisor logo everywhere, but better to focus on the cuisinePlease check my review tried 2 others indian restaurants lately130 SGD for 2Tandori a bit expensiv
5
I visited Lagnaa Restaurant to meet a good friend, May and she introduced us together with my bestfriend, Inna to the true essence of love for food-Lagnaa. The food was great! You can choose the level of "hotness" of your meals. What strikes me most is the best service I got from Lagnaa headed by K7. You have to meet this guy together with Kumari and Krishna! They will served you with warmth and sweet smiles. It feels like home amidst the busy street of Upper Dickson Road. Lagnaa Restaurant is the star of all Indian Restaurants in Singapore! Ask K7 the difference between Stars and Satellites! You will be amazed not just with the food but the personality of the Master Chef! If you happened to be in SG, please visit Lagnaa- the true essence of love
5
Went to test the chilli scale, managed to eat a chicken curry on level 5 and made it to the peg wall. Wow that was spicy I'd hate to think how hot a 7 or 8 would be. Overall the food was amazing and service was great. Next time I'm in Singapore I'm going back to test a 7 or 8
5
So many reasons why I love going to Lagnaa. I always feel good choosing this popular restaurant. Great conversations with locals and visitors compliment my meal. You choose the level of spice, No MSG, each order cooked just for you. Not 'warming pans' holding in wait for an order. Fresh, tasty, full menu, and great staff. Server made perfect suggestions for me. She asked questions getting to know my likes first. A bit hidden in Little India so look for the 2 1/2 meter chef statue close to the street that welcomes you. PS. a very clean toilet/bathroom/WC upstairs for customers
4
Great spicy food, not for the weak ones though. Located in the lovely "little India" the atmosphere is really mellow. The lady taking orders and inviting to friendly chats is a champ.
4
Friendly, informative and very welcoming. Maybe a little pricey but worth it imo. We made it to level 3 chilli! Maybe could have gone a little higher but that was still hot!
4
We stopped in to Langnaa during a recent trip to Singapore. Deep in the Little India it differs from all the others due to the Chilli challenge. Not for us, but plenty have tried and failed.
A great menu, great friendly staff and fantastic flavours.
5
Had a very enjoyable dinner for 2; nice authentic ambience, very tasty, great service, decent prices... will return!Note: upstairs dining means sitting on floor pillows - some physical flexibility required...
5
went to lagnaa after a friend recommended going. they food was amazing and they service was even better. The owners were accomodating and helped me figure out what to order. I had their most popular fish curry, level 2. SO PERFECT, the garlic naan was delicious and i still dream of the mango lassi. everyone should go if they have the chance
4
Great curry, atmosphere and off the track location.Love the hotness rating on the food although watch peer pressure doesn't push you too far. Hot but still great flavours even at a level 6. Now I have to wait for a full moon to retur
5
This is a very nice pick, located in the funky "Little India" district. Tucked in a small street, the friendly restaurant welcomes travellers from around the world in a very relaxed and playful atmosphere. The Indian dishes on the menu cater to all tastes: vegetarian and non-vegeterian. Food is flavourful and delicious, and served in nice portions with traditional Indian bread and sauce. I have especially loved the chicken Tikka and chicken tandoori. As for drinks, they have nice imported wines that pair well with the spiciness of the dishes, but also Indian cold beer and traditional drinks like lime lassi, masala tea etc...The service is absolutely SUPER: very friendly, easy-going yet attentive and efficient. You are in for a very good time, no matter your spice tolerance. Talking of which, some dishes are flexible and you can chose your spiciness level. Prices are really affordable too.But the funniest part is the "Spice Contest" that Lagnaa organises every full moon nights. On this occasion, you can sign-in and hope to be part of the "spice wall of fame", which is divided into spice levels from 4 to 10. Every participant has to go through a check-in procedure, and even sign-in a formal disclaimer in case of spice intolerance! The dish of the competition is a single-dish of chicken in sauce, with different spice levels. I tried the level 7 and almost died. But it was so much fun to do. There are some rules too: you can't eat cheese nan or drink lassi to help...and no one should help you finish your dish: 1 dish 1 person. Upon validation by the staff that you have finished your entire dish without sweating or cheating, your minute of fame comes: you are given a clothe pin with your name on it, and you can tie it to the wall of fame, at the level you have achieved! As from level 7, the Boss will personally come to shake your hand as a sign of recognition, and as from level 9 (very few people!) you have your picture on the wall! I loved it. It was SOOOO much fun. Before I started eating my competition dish, I recall an American man with his wife who was going "oh god...oh god" next to me, full of sweat. It was hilarious. Be careful though: you can really hurt yourself if you have weak digestion or ulcer problems. But you can still have fun watching the funny faces of the folks doing the contest! A great place to go with your friends.I always go back to Lagnaa every time I am in Singapore. Even months after, the Boss still comes to salute me in memory of my painfully-achieved level 7 :)A tip for budget travellers and back-packers: the restaurant, never short of tongue-in-cheek humour, is looking for what they call "slave-workers" to work night shifts at the restaurant (waitressing or kitchen work). While expectedly it isn't paid, they offer you lots of food to eat. So if you travel on a tight budget, here's a fun way to get great food and great fun for no bucks

Look for the owner (Kesevan - pronounced 'Kay-seven') or his sister. Lovely, friendly people who are as passionate about the people as they are about their food.Delicious Northern Indian with a mix of southern indian dishes with the ability to choose your level of spice/heat. For those who are not so used to having their mouths on fire, start with a 2, after all, SOME heat is needed for maximum enjoyment. My friends tried a 4 and they were perspiring profusely even though they are old hands and have asbestos palates. The palak paneer is mild and delicious (creamed spinach with curd) as was the butter chicken. The lamb/mutton was spicier and the papadams made out of glass. They crackle snap and pop with the best rice crispies.Great experience rounded out with great hosts. Niggles;A bit warm downstairsRecommendation; Go upstairs to the air condtioned area for the full experience. You'll be sitting on the floor and ask them to show you how to eat with your hands
4
The place caught my eye as I was walking by across the street. We decided to stop,in for an early dinner/late lunch, 'round 4:30.Service was quick and friendly. Had the garlic naan, a couple lassis mango and sweet, the buyer chicken and mutton Marsala spice level three.Very tasty, the chicken was creamy and flavorful, the mutton just spicy enough at three - I'm glad I didn't let the waitress talk me into a lower spice level as she tried. I think I could have gone to a four but a six or seven would have been out do the question. By Singapore standards the price wasn't too bad. I could have done with a larger portion of naan and rice, but overall I was pleased. We will be back
4
Amazingly creative and interesting decor. Slightly offbeat but lovely and colorful. I could tell that these guys WANTED to give their customers an authentic taste of Indian food and not just a pathetic excuse that you get in most places in Little India. That might explain the slightly higher prices. Having eaten my fair share of Indian food growing up in India I could tell that they had used the right mix of spices and ingredients that most restaurants ignore. I didn't see too much artificial colour in their food as well (a chronic ailment these days in most indian restaurants).Great Experience. Hope to go back there
3
Many people have written good things about this place but in my case the experience was average. The food wasnt any special, portions were small , and the prise for so small portions was a little bit heavy. Not going to visit again.
5
Brought my clients here for dinner and Shanti, the manager, took very good care of us. The menu was well planned and service was excellent. All my guests enjoyed the food, especially the grilled items and the saffron basmati rice.
4
Very very tasty food. However the only problem is the price. It was very expensive. Loved the service too. Seating area was a bit uncomfortable. Overall a different experience
5
We visited Lagnaa last Saturday and had a wonderful evening and I would strongly recommend this restaurant. The food and service was excellent! My friend is 5 months pregnant, so we decided to forgo the barefoot experience and instead, sat at an outside table alongside the street. It was perfect. As soon as we arrived, the staff was attentive and informative. To determine our spice level, the staff suggested we try a chilli chicken that was at the 1 Â½ level. It was a great way to see the spice tolerance of the 6 people in our party. The staff were very eager to please and at our request, ordered the main dishes for our table with a wonderful variety of naan bread. All the dishes were absolutely delicious and enjoyed by each of us. The highest level of spice ordered was a 3 and feeling brave, we decided to order one more dish at the 5 level. It was so good and also confirmed that this was probably the limit for us. I look forward to dining at Lagnaa again and would recommend this restaurant to friends
4
Ate here with my girlfriend and it was perfect! Meal size was spot on and the price was good. The idea of having a spice level was genius. I had a level 3 and the spice was just right. My girlfriend had 1.5 and that was too hot for her. (Not good with spice) if you are not sure what spice you would be, you can have a spice test which will be your starter. Great idea. Wish I could stay here longer to go back and beat a 3! Staff are friendly and knowledgable. Highly recommend
2
I like the concept of barefoot dining and wish more restaurants followed it. On the day i went, only regular seats were available though. They were probably 70% full and yet dishes took 45 minutes to an hour to arrive. There was no compensation by way of discount for the waiting. There are some interesting dishes but 8$ for special naan and 7$ for mango lassi is just way too expensive. We ended up spending $100 for 3 people, limited portions, vegetarian meals. And still had to go to another place later to fill our stomachs.The whole 10 chilli levels thing did'nt entertain me. I can live with normal or less chilli. I do not eat to challenge myself. So i find the concept silly
4
The food was very tasteful and there were a broad variety of dishes to choose from. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We choose to eat in the second floor, which is barefoot dining. This was a new experience for us, and a bit uncomfortable for the most of the group. Besides that, food, service and atmosphere were great.
5
Lagnaa is our go-to restaurant for interesting, creative Indian food in a friendly atmosphere. The staff are authentically friendly and passionate about their work. I recommend the second floor where you take off your shoes, sit on pillows on the floor, away from the hub-bub of the street. Try at least one of the monthly specials
3
Lagnaa is my favourite indian restaurant in Singapore. The food is so good. However the prices are expensive and even if I came there 100 times and often with large groups of friends, the owners know me well but they never gave me any discount or free drinks or desert...
5
I dropped by twice, first time with bunch of friends, second time with my wife. Both times left me pleasant memory, especially the latter one on Valentine's Day. I made the reservation. They prepared the best seat for me and my wife, two glasses of wine, a candle and great service of course. The highlight was when they came to my wife with a heart-shaped naan with a small candle and strawberry on top. The surprise was there hiding a secret message inside the naan which I told them to write down for me. Great night!I will definitely visit more. They are opening the third floor for even privileged get-together/party which can contain 12-15 ppl
4
Its a worth going place, I'm not an expert on Indian food but I found very tasteful specialy the Naam .
5
The food is spectacular and the owners are warm and friendly.
Even with a strong spice the food still has lots of great flavor.
3
We went there on a Saturday. There were may be about 15 people upstairs. It took an hour to get our food on the table. I won't say the food is extraordinary, especially in Little India where you have several Indian Restaurants.
5
The Food was good but not lip smacking..where lagnaa stands out is its service making the entire experience one to remember..way to go lagnaa...
4
Was craving some Indian food and saw the reviews on TripAdvisor. The food was great and the owner and staff were very attentive.
4
I had been to 'Lagnaa Barefoot Dining' once before with friends of mine and was most impressed with the simple, genuine and heartfelt ambience, not to mention the delicious food and impressive selection of unique beer. So when my sister, whose recently arrived in Singapore, came to celebrate her birthday, I suggested Lagnaa.We were 5 people for dinner (2 kids & 3 adults) and ordered a variety of different curries from chicken tikka masala to prawn Goan curry, a lovely daal, plain and garlic naans, raiita and mango chutney. My sisters kids were both intrigued and slightly intrepid with regards to the spice scale so we never ventured beyond 1.5 out of 10. The food was perfect, extremely delicious and the staff were truly wonderful. Master Chef K7 joked about his age, challenged my niece to a timed running race from one side of the restaurant to the next (probably not the best to do with a belly full of curry!) and even organised a chocolate birthday cake and a signed barefoot greeting card. We had a great night, the kids loved it and the staff of Lagnaa were very friendly and great fun. I would wholeheartedly recommend this little gem of an eatery to anyone passing through Singapore or in need of a fun night out and a desire to test their tastebuds! Thank you to the Lagnaa family for a memorable night! We will return.... and next time maybe push our spice'ometers to a 2
5
This restaurant was amazing! Staff were so friendly, happy to tell us everything we needed to know about the food and interesting to talk to. The dining experience was different to anything I have had in a standard restaurant and I loved it! The food was all great, really delicious flavors. If you are travelling through and want a restaurant to remember then go here, the perfect night out
4
The service was great, restaurant is clean and the food is very nice.The food is served in grading from 1.5 - 10 for spiciness.I like hot food but I don't think I could handle more than the number 2. The chef will even tell you he can't do more than a 3
4
We've been to Lagnaa with a group of 8 people and had foot on the 2nd floor, where it was for mostly all of us the first time dining barefoot while sitting on the floor.Shanti - the host of the restaurant - was very nice and helped a lot during the reservation and ordering. She even took some pictures and mailed them to us afterwards. very nice!Food quality was very good, the highlight for me personally was the different types of Nan, which I never have had before. Rest of the food was also good, comparable to other good Indian restaurants I've already been.All of us really enjoyed this experience and we left the restaurant satisfied. Highly recommendable if you seek for a good Indian Restaurant in Little India
4
The place is neat and clean. The food is superb and the waiters corteous and willing to make suggestions if you ask them. We requested a dish that was not in the menu due to new chinese year and they prepared it for us right away. If you want a mild spicy meal you will get it unless you prefer a real hot and spicy meal, in which case you will have it prepared according to your taste. Price is good. Located in little India. Go upstairs where you have to eat barefoot. It"s nicer than downstair
4
Sitting on floor bare-footed upstairs was novel. Staff were incredibly nice. Only thing was my mutton was too salty, but chilli chicken starter was perfect.
If you like it hot, go for 4+.
5
I enjoyed my meal very much. Best food I've had in Singapore so far. The food was great and the service was even better.
5
Excellent warm friendly service , with a few great quirky ideas such as the chilli chart :)
Food was lovely
5
We found Lagnaa by accident, looking for somewhere tried years ago. Staff were friendly and chatty as we were deciding to try or not, but not pushy. Chicken Briyani, Mutton Masala, butter Naan, all incrediably tasty and very delicious. Will absolutely return next time in Singapore. Fun rating board on how hot you can handle your chillies, is a fun talking point,with no-one having reached #10-we salute you!

I stumbled upon this small restaurant walking around in Little India with my wife. We saw the challenge of the hottest plates and decided to try it. I couldn't even get through level 6. It was fire! Everything was delicious and we had a wonderful conversation with the owner about indian food and the different types of hot peppers. I Definitely recommend it

My husband and I visited this restaurant yesterday, based on its TA rating, but without reading the reviews. The food was ok - nothing to write home about, though the mango lassis were delicious. The service was good, though I found the waitress a bit patronising with regards to the chilli scale. It was very expensive too - even by Australian standards!!Overall, the restaurant seemed geared towards tourists - not an authentic Little India experience.

We had food there last week. (+) The barefoot dining is upstairs. Leave shore on the stairs, sit on floor with small tables for dining. Not bad a setting. (+) Food had 1-10 spice ratings, one being mild and getting spicier as you climb the scale. On normal days ratings 1-6 are only open and only 'full moon party' or something they open the 7-10 scales. Interesting and worth a try.(-) Very pricey.The food was tasty (mixed review) and service was quick. Staff were friendly. Did not catch the name by there was a local chinese chap who was quite friendly and had good advice on spice scales etc. Appreicated! The main course was mixed in taste. Bread and curry were nice. Youghurt rice and lassi were just terrible, So try your luck! Not that extensive a menu, but sufficent.Recommendation: Try to stick within spice levels of 4. Anything above is just for fun as you cannot taste anything in the dish except for the chilli. We tried a 6 rated chickpea masala and it just tasted of chilli paste

We were off Serangoon road in Little India and stumbled upon this small place that looked cute so we took a look at the menu and gave it a go. I've been living in Singapore for 3 years and love Indian food. Unfortunately this has to rank as one of the most overpriced and disappointing meals I've ever had in Singapore. $35 bought us the tiniest Tandoori meat platter - 2 lamb, 2 chicken, 2 fish, 2 prawn. All small and not special at all. No rice, no nothing came with it. Perhaps it was our mistake going meat at a place with an extensive vegetarian menu but nonetheless it was egregious
5
Shanti and Kesevan are great hosts. K7 is a master chef who cooks the best indian in Singapore and possibly elsewhere! Try the chili challenge if you dare or book for some other great nights like cooking classes, wine pairings and food tasting. Either dine barefoot upstairs in the aircon or sit downstairs and watch life go by in Little India. Superb food, excellent service, friendly staff and great times

Keeping up with our family tradition, we decided to eat out the new year's lunch. With parents being around our choice was limited to Indian food. While doing an online search for an exclusive place we stumbled upon Lagnaa and despite quite a few warnings on this site and others we decided to give the place a try hoping that the experience would be unique.I called them on 31st Dec and booked a place for 6 "upstairs"for our lunch today, but when we turned up at noon time today we were surprised when the server said that they did not have any reservation but can accommodate us! It would have been quite a turndown if we reached a bit late as the place eventually got full.The place itself was quite unique, both upstairs and downstairs, pleasingly different from a bunch of thousand other choices available in Little India. The building is run down but the decor is quite simple and clean. Even the restroom was surprisingly very clean.Our server helped us order fro the menu, explaining to us the various levels of spiciness that they have. With my parents being pure vegetarian we had a mix of both vegetarian dishes and non veg on our order.As has been mentioned in many previous reviews, we found the serving quantity quite small and overall food quite overpriced. 2 of our dishes, yellow dal and chicken kurma, had less salt BUT I must say that each of the item that was served had a very unique taste. Even the vegetarian items like the Pakoda was quite unique and tasty. All our dishes scored high on the taste meter.Service was quite slow, but that should be expected from similar restaurants, but they could have served us in the right order. For eg, the veg starter took quite long to arrive and it would have helped if they had served us the starters together. I realised that they billed us for the "Pappadums" served on the table. For a place that costs almost $40 per pax, I believe that they should not be charging this item, especially since it is served to us even without ordering.I was surprised not to find many Indians visiting as is evident from the other reviews, but considering the prices I am not surprised any more.Our overall experience was quite unique and satisfactory. This is certainly not our everyday restaurant, but unlike any other one certainly come out with pleasing memories.We will try a chilli challenge in our next visit!

We stumbled upon the restaurant whilst exploring little India and were pleased that we did. You can choose the heat of your curry and there is a good selection of veggie and non-veggie. The owner was great and staff really friendly.

My father (a retired judge from the UK) was visiting Singapore and wanted to sample a "very hot curry" so I took him to Lagnaa Barefoot Dining as I had heard about the spice levels. He sampled a Level 6 mutton curry which was delicious (although he complained still not hot enough!) and he got his peg on the wall. I enjoyed my tasty Level 2 prawn curry. After our meal the staff then invited us to join them and share their wine and conversation which was a highlight of the trip for him. Thank you Lagnaa
5
I have not enough good things to say about Lagnaa. First, the attention was excellent, they make you feel like you were at home, an invited guest. Second, they give you advice on which dishes you would enjoy, this is something I value very much at a restaurant. Third, the food is amazing, the rating system for the spicyness is very funny and I certainly will be back to beat my mark (sadly at a measly 1.5). Wrapping up: absolutely recommended from someone who has eaten Indian food in many countries
5
We got to know Lagnaa from our colleagues who had been to the restaurant before. They were all praise for the service and definitely the "SPICE LEVEL CHALLENGE". So me and my brother decided to test our limits but as this was our first visit we could try only level 6. The food tasted very good and it reminded me of my grandmothers recipes. We thoroughly enjoyed the dishes and very able to successfully complete level 6. Will cetainly make it a point to go back to the restaurant to challenge myself with the other spice levels as well.Thanks to the warm smiles and wonderful service of the staff

The sitting on the floor atmosphere was fun, waiters were attentive and friendly and overall a nice way to spend a dinnerWe had 3 plates, naan, rice and drinks for under s$100 which was fine, but the main dishes were fairly small serves. That would probably be the only criticism, if you are going to make good food, be more generous in the serve size. Little India on the other hand has issues which did not make my wife feel comfortable to be around, and cabs would not stop for us making the return a non starter. The Restuarant is a good reason to visit, the precinct is not.We wish the operators the best in getting a cultural change to the location and taxis (what is their deal ?
5
We walked to the restaurant from the Bugis area and the Map on trip advisor gave us the wrong location. Make sure you look for Upper Dickson rd not Dickson rd.The restaurant owner welcomed us and talked us through the different menu options. The food was great and you can choose the chilli level of each dish. We choose level 2 out of the 10 point scale and it was hot and spicy enough for us.Service was attentive and friendly with our only negative being we believed the dinner was slightly overpriced.Other than that I would recommend this restaurant if you are after a great Indian Meal
5
Lagnaa is the place to go for awesome authentic indian food, combined with great service. We've been 6 or 7 times since we moved to Sgp. The food tasting nights are great for trying new dishes and choosing what makes it to the specials next month.Always welcomed with a genuine smile and staff who know there and enjoy their food.Cant wait to go back again
5
Great food, excellent service: a must-try! Friendly people, giving good advices et attentive while we chose plates. I highly recommend this place to everyone who wanna spend a nice time exploring tasty indian food and discover their chilli tolerance level ;) Visit the place for your birthday to enjoy some surprises
5
Having visited 6 years ago and enjoyed the experience I really wanted to return. We'd read the various reviews on trip advisor prior to going and with a few of the more recent being unhappy we weren't sure what to expect.We shouldn't have worried. The service was good, friendly when we arrived, attentive while we chose and ordered and then we were left alone while eating. Both our dishes (butter chicken and a chicken with mushroom dish) were tasty and whilst the portions were not massive they were certainly big enough. The price didn't seem excessive by Singapore standards (S$80 for two of us) and with the added bonus of being able to choose spice rating according to taste and sit barefoot on the floor (we know it's a gimmick but it's a fun gimmick) we'd definitely return next time we're in town
2
3 pax for dinnerLocation: easy to access but a killer if you're driving. It took us half an hour to find parking and my party didn't feel comfortable with so many men lurking in poorly lit alleys. 3/10Decor: eclectic. Downstairs wall decorated with graffiti highlighting the many tourists that have dined here(a prelude to the pricing ....)Upstairs is barefoot ( wear clean socks and make sure your feet don't stink). All sit on floor cushions with low tables that accommodate 3-4 pax depending on your girth. 6/10Service: warm & friendly 8/10Food presentation: Poor. No introduction to what the various coloured dishes were. All served in ubiquitous dishes and frankly didn't appeal visually 3/10Food quality: above average 7/10. It actually tastes better than it looks. But it's not mind blowing stuff that I couldn't find elsewhere.Food portion: small 5/10Drinks: assortment of Indian beer albeit a little overpriced.Value for money: poor. Overpriced. About $200 for 3 pax including drinks.Would I return? unlikely. A twist on the usual north Indian restaurants because of the seating arrangements but that's insufficient to justify the prices
5
I loved this place. The food was incredible, and the service was great. Not much more to say than that. If I'm ever back in Singapore I'm headed straight back to this place.
3
Eaten a lot of Indian over the years and wouldn't rate this one in my top ten. Curries were just ok, not great and quite small servings. Spinach Paneer only had 3 pieces in it. Price was high compared to other outlets. Service however was really good
5
Fantastic place to eat! Fantastic food! Fantastic atmosphere!! They have a unique system of choosing how hot you want your food. If you like spice try a five but if you dare go a ten. No one else has ever done ie finished it.Mild curries available and the taste is fantastic. Staff are friendly, polite and treat your like friends. Highly recommended!

So here we are with my wife in Singapore - she for the second time, me - for the first time. I have good friends and colleagues from India and i've been taken to many dining places. But this place we found ourselves by accident and it's a gem. *I'll start with the food quality - it is very well prepared and very, very tasty. The tika's (we tried chicken and prawns) were great. We went again today (i'm re-writing the review for the second time 'cause it didn't work out with the hotel's internet, but that's another review.) We had some more dishes (e.g. palak-paneer and some very tasty rice) which also were great.*The menu is big enough for one to have multiple visits there and i really enjoyed the wonderful nans and the fresh mango juice.*Hygiene: Katerina-my wife was absolutely ok with it. Grade which, trust me, is very difficult to achieve:) Plates and silverware are absolutely fine. To wash your hands you need to go to the kitchen - the sink was clean, the kitchen was fine too.*Location and interior: The location of the restaurant is good, even if you decide to go there by the MRT, you get off at little India station and then walk for about 10 minutes along Serangoon road till Upper Dickson road. The first floor is all small tables (2's and 4's-i'm not sure by the last thing) which could be combined as we saw. There is a second and a third floor which we found out when we were leaving after the first visit - it looks very cozy (we just went there to look around) and you need to take your shoes off before you climb the stairs. You are seated on the floor which i like a lot. You should definitely see the first floor's wall tiles scribbled from top to bottom by guests who had markers...we didn't :S there are also clothing clips with names written on them on long strings along the wall.Tip: if you go in the late afternoon or evening you should call in advance to book places.In general - amazing Indian food and warm, very nice personnel there.Tomorrow we leave and one of the things i'll miss will be this place
4
I enjoy the cosy atmosphere here. The guest are served to sit on the floor, which sometimes is interesting. Indian food is good and spicy. The staff is so friendly to explain the menu for us. Good jobs!The price is affordable. Good place for a try on Indian food

We went to Lagnaa on the strength of the reviews on Tripadvisor. We were told to remove our footwear and were led upstairs to the second floor, which has small tables laid out with little floor cushions strewn next to them. The ambiance is casual and the diners were laid back and seemed to be enjoying themselves. The staff was quite pushy and tried to get us to order drinks; she actually appeared irritated when we declined.The menu is distinctly unexciting for vegetarians. We ordered a butter paneer, a chilli cauliflower and mushroom dish that was not the menu, and some naans. We realised how overrated and overpriced the restaurant was when the food finally arrived. The portions were pathetic. I could hardly find the cauliflower and mushrooms in the tangle of onions. Further, I have never had a paneer dish with only 7-8 almond-sized pieces of paneer floating in the (overly sweet) gravy. The food was totally disappointing and a far cry from authentic Indian cuisine. We left feeling hungry and dissatisfied. There are much, much better options to be found nearby in Serangoon Road which offer better value for money
4
Properly cooked Indian food with delicious roti/naan etc on offer.... Fun environment as well and especially good in the evening. The restaurant is small and gets very crowded... Has a slightly "hippie" feel to it.... No idea whether you can book. A very good choice for indian food....
4
We had a lovely dinner accompanied by two large bottles of beer, Indian brands that we hadn't tried before (S$15 each). The appetizer was a Chilli Chicken dish (S$10), and mains were Prawn Goa (S$17 and Kathiri Pach (S$10), accompanied by naan bread. We rounded everything off with pistachio ice cream (S$7) and Indian coffee (S$6). We found everything delightfully to our taste and couldn't complain about the quality; additionally, the staff was very friendly and helped us choose the right level of spiciness for us. The only thing that took us aback somewhat was that the total bill came to almost S$100, which is a good bit higher than what we are used to paying in Hong Kong for a similar meal. The price of the beer particularly! It was about three to five times what we would pay under similar circumstances. However, we had been warned ahead of time that Singapore was expensive, so it didn't come as a complete shock. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to visitors who are looking for a good Indian meal
2
We visited this restaurant due to the excellent reviews and the trip advisor certificate of excellence but have to say were very disappointed by the lack of authenticity. We were greeted very warmly by the staff and took a table upstairs where you have to take off your shoes. This is just gimmick and after a full meal of sitting on the floor it did get very uncomfortable. The prices are also very high and there are many better options for dining in Serangoon road, the waitress gave us the drink menu first and when I asked for the food menu, she replied back with a 'no order a drink first'. Very appaling behavior from the restaurant staff, the food took a long time to come. They have a monthly food tasting team and when I saw the photo of them, they were all of non Indian origin - need I say more about the authenticity
3
This restaurant comes highly recommended and has a trip advisor certificate of excellence, so we thought lets try it. The food is really only so so, bit bland and just totally not exciting. We were very disappointed. Even though the restaurant is cute and cosy, the owners are really nice and wonderful, but for the food I would not recommend it. There is so much fantastic food in Little India, it really gets a lot better (and cheaper) than at Lagnaa
5
very nice restaurant with excellent food. The friendly staff make you feel at home and help you relax in the madness of little india. The upper floor is the best place, something different!
5
This is simply the best Indian food in Singapore. The owners are very friendly and always willing to give advice on the food selection. A perfect combination of spice levels from the most mild of tastes to the true fire eaters, this restaurant suits all.
4
We'd been recommended this tucked-away restaurant in Little India and from the moment of our arrival we felt welcomed and relaxed. Sitting outside, in the company of the owners as it was early evening, we not only enjoyed an exceptionally friendly atmosphere, but the food was great (although a bit pricey). We were guided through the main menu, based on our 'taster' dish to determine how hot our taste buds could cope with!A memorable and entertaining experience - thanks
4
We stayed in Wanderlust which is down the road. If your staying in the hotel its back up Dickson Rd towards Little India and its on the left. The restaurant offers goods range and surroundings. The wine isn't the cheapest and not what you would expect from the place.Not a bad place but probably better value/more authentic in Little India
5
We usually don't eat early but all of us found ourselves to be hungry even though it was barely 6pm. Finding Lagnaa was easy enough although I was pleasantly surprised with it's modest appearance and decor. At first I was a little anxious about sitting upstairs because at my age, sitting cross legged isn't as easy as it once was but I was able to make myself comfortable just the same. We had the room to ourselves and the full attention of our server who made several recommendations, all of which we accepted. The food was served very quickly.Everything we ate was delicious with bright, fresh flavors. There had been substantial discussions on how spicy we wanted our food and while I prefer my Indian food spicier than ours was served, there were others in our party who wouldn't have enjoyed it it had been any hotter. Regardless, there wasn't a single dish that produced even the slightest criticism EXCEPT that I felt that all the portions were too small. We had five entrees plus three appetizers to share and whereas no one in our party of four left hungry, I felt that there should have been leftovers. While we were ordering, my wife kept saying, "We're ordering too much food!" but our server thought that we were ordering the right amount and she was right.All that being said, it was a delightful and memorable meal
5
We loved this restaurant. The service is excellent and the food very interesting and well presented. The staff were very helpful also. We didn't sit upstairs as we didn't like sitting on the floor. Downstairs was buzzing. Its in a great location and was well recommend by our hotel which was a 5 minute walk away. Would certainly go back on our next trip

I knew about this restaurant via net friends who organized get-together event at this restaurant. I wasn't able to join so I went for a visit with my friend. What is special is there is no chair and you have to seat on floor while dine. When I reached there, I found they actually have normal dining area with chair at level 1 (no aircorn) and level 2 where you have to remove your shoes and sit on the map. We were there for lunch and no much people. We were the only when we arrived, then later a family joined. Food tasted average but it is considered expensive for me as 2 of us with 2 dishes and naan and 2 drinks costed us more than $50. The portions are the normal size(if you been to Indian restaurant then you will know the normal size I referred) that you usually have in most Indian restaurant.
4
From the moment hostess Kumari welcomed us into the restaurant - we were initially trying to figure out whether this was an all veg - we felt very much at ease and began to enjoy ourselves. The chili hotness rating chart immediately placed a challenge to me and thank goodness good sense prevailed and we settled for a #3 "Hotter (Chef can't - can you?!)". The food and presentation were well above what you would normally expect in Little India (usually meaning canteen style ambience and service). We'll be back - and will try to move up the chili hotness ladder

Having lived in Singapore for over 20 years as an expatriate, I can honestly say I know what constitutes value for money. Singapore is a melting pot of cultures and food with prices as diverse as the experience. My wife and I stopped off at Lagnaa this evening, partly enticed by the quirky ambiance (travelers are encouraged to pen their love for the restaurant on the wall tiles, or onto clothes pegs attached to one another on a clothes line) and partly because of the TripAdvisor recommendation adorning several wall spaces, including a huge poster at the back of the restaurant.We ordered 1x Mutton Biryani and 1x Fish Biryani. After waiting over 40 minutes it arrived. The presentation was quaint, but having waited over half an hour we were swiftly tucking into the dishes.The taste was good, and even for me, very spicy. Wanting to share my mutton biryani with my wife I dug to the bottom of the rice pot for more mutton, having had two small pieces already, I was presuming there would be more. To my astonishment, there wasn't any mutton left. In my eagerness to appease my hunger had I mistakenly eaten 4 or 5 pieces without noticing? No, I had not, that was it. 2 tiny morsels of mutton engulfed in rice. We were both quite upset. Yes we knew the price of $17 was much higher than what you would pay at Chat Masala (established Indian restaurant in stylish air-conditioned comfort) for example, but we were presuming the portions would warrant that price. How wrong we were.We approached the restaurant manager who explained that the portions of mutton were weighed out, was this an excuse? or an apology of sorts? We simply said that $17 for two mere morsels of mutton was extortionate, yet it seemed to fall on deaf ears.After receiving the bill another lady stepped forward and asked whether I had dug down deep enough into the bowl, which was a little condescending. The bill included additional extortionate charges including $1.50 for pappadums- which had arrived at our table without our request - so you would presume it were complimentary and $2 for hot water which you would presume was also complimentary!In an establishment where they pride themselves on their TripAdvisor ranking we were both upset and disappointed that Lagnaa had charged us for the main meal and even more so that they had charged us for warm water!On their website Kaesvan the founder and head chef prides himself " ..in ensuring that everything is done to make your visit a delightful experience." I beg to differ, travellers beware!A pathetic hole-in-the-wal

Made very welcome on our arrival . Our host spent time to explain the menu and purpose of the taste test regarding heat of the meal we about to order . The four of us ordered a selection of meals which we shared all very good , however the buttered chicken was a clear winner with two of the party . Good selection of beers and interesting deserts. Would recommend if you want to try something a little different. Not the biggest place, therefore probably advisable to book 
3
Food I had was little more than average,and a bit pricy compared to a lot of eating places in little india.Suffered with an upset stomach for 2 days!
2
Ate here yesterday and have to say the food is pretty good but not worth the price tag. The portion sizes are very small and cost arm and a leg. I would suggest eating at one of the indian places in the mall that are as good and at one fifth of the cost.In addition, there seemed to be alot of fishy activities going on. Many people were entering the kitchen and walking around that did not work at the restaurant. The owner knew them based on the conversations. It was quite unsettling
4
I traveled to S'pore for business, alone. One of my personal goals for the trip was to sample as many different Asian cuisines as possible. I decided one night would be Indian night, and chose Lagnaa as my tentative destination based on earlier reviews. I set off for the 20-minute walk from my hotel to the Little India quarter. Being from suburban USA, and having never been to India, the neighborhood made me feel immersed, almost transported. This is not a locals' joint, and there were no Indian customers, so I guess Bourdain (who I love) would disapprove. The staff was friendly, and service was prompt. I found their number scale for spice/heat was helpful, and I followed the nice lady's recommendation for mutton curry. Her suggestion of a 2 on the heat scale was just right as well. By mid-meal, my eyes were watering and my nose was running, but I didn't feel like it was a Man vs Food challenge. I asked what would be typical in South India and she said a 3, so you've been warned. I'm glad that I went, I enjoyed the meal, and I suspect you will too

5 of us ranging in age from early thirties to mid-sixties visited this gem of a restaurant tucked away in little India in Singapore. Due to the variety of physical states we opted to eat downstairs rather than upstairs where one takes off ones shoes and sits on the floor. ( after the food I think I would have needed lifting up !)From the moment we entered, we were treated as though we were the only clients in the place. Fantastic inter personal skills shown by all staff. The food was exceptional and their challenge to eat some of the dishes on a 10 point spiciness scale is unique a provides a great talking point. We had 2 dishes at point 1 on the scale , 2 at point 2 , 1 at point 4 and 1 at point 6. You have to manage a point 6 before even ordering a point 7. Only 1 person since they opened over 5 years ago has managed a level 9 and nobody has managed a 10 !The graffiti wall is brilliant and we will certainly visit Lagnaa again on our next visit. My son who lives in Singapore is already arranging his next visit. Try it you will NOT be disappointed
5
Been here a couple of times before. A unique dining experience and a must visit - great food selection with the choice of spice from 1-6 (for those who can manage a 6 if you visit again on a full moon, seriously, you can graduate from 7-10. Although only 1 person has ever managed a 9). The staff are friendly and the Indian beers are great. Takes some getting used to sitting on the floor but that's all part of the experience
4
Amazing experience in this restaurantEither you go to the upper floor and you take your shoes off on the stairs or you got lunch on the gr floorWe choosed the ground floor cause no body is up after taking off our shoesWhat is the most amazing is that they propose to you 10 levels of hot 1 is not hot and 10 is the maximumThey have a scale fixed on the wall and a definition to every level with wood pinces on wich they write the names of the person who ate  From level 4 and aboveNobody achived the 10th but only 1 maked No 9You can his name from a washington post article saying that he is austalian and he will come back to try the level 1
5
You have wasted a trip to Singapore if you don't eat here. I read a lot of reviews complaining this restaurant was more expensive than others in the area but let me just say you get what you pay for. The food is absolutely amazing and if you are really into spicy food, like my girlfriend and I, this restaurant is not afraid to bring the heat. The chili scale ranges from 1-10 (with only one person in the world being able to eat a level 9 and the chef himself can't go above a 3). The heat is great but the flavor and quality of the food is what should make you want to eat here. When you order a shrimp curry you get at least 10 shrimp. When you order fish curry there is at least 7-8 big chunks of fish meat. The staff was incredibly friendly as well and made good recommendations for the indian beer and first time spice levels (we started with a 4 and a 3). Another diner there let me try his level 6 and it was HOT, I cannot wait to go back to Singapore to eat here during the full moon party so I can try a level 7. The heat is very intense so don't get overly cocky when you order a level 4-6 thinking it will be "western level" spicy. Make sure you eat upstairs without your shoes to make the most of you experience to this awesome restaurant. Also, if you can, have a chat with the chef. He is an incredibly nice guy and we had a good chat about a possible curry in the future using chinese and indian spices as well as wasabi. Thank you Lagnaa for the wonderful dining experience

In the heart of Little India lies a hidden gem - Lagnaa (means Your Essence) Barefoot Restaurant. It is easy to locate Lagnaa once you turn into Upper Dickson Road as you will spot a thumbs-up, winking chef statue - Manmathan (means Handsome) guarding the entrance. At every corner of the ground level, your eyes will find something interesting such as the ubiquitous signoffs on the walls from happy patrons and the Chilli level scoreboard from levels 1 - 10. Lagnaa conducts a monthly Chilli Challenge where you can challenge your spice level by completing a bowl of masala cooked by the executive chef-cum-owner - K7 (Kaesaven). You even have to fill up an Indemnity Form first! Lassi (yogurt drink) is not allowed as dairy products can quell spiciness but one can take naan or rice. I could only managed up to level 7! Lagnaa also conducts food tasting and wine sessions and cooking classes where K7 will share his secrets behind the delectable cuisine. Going barefooted makes one feel unencumbered, connected…. the 2nd air-conditioned level (furnished with low tables and cushions) is where you can thrive on real food in bare feet. You will be first served with a dish of light, airy, crispy papadums. For appetizers, the wonderful and charming staff – Shanti and Kumaarrie may recommend starting with chilli chicken at spice level 1.5 to gauge your spice level. My favourite dishes include the tender fish and chicken tikka, ambrosial butter chicken which comes with a creamy, decadent goodness, tangy threadfin fish curry and mutton masala suffused with authentic spice mix. Pair the dishes with the fluffy and slightly crispy garlic cranberry naan and the flavorful Kashmiri Pilau or basmati Rice. Don’t forget to order the thick, creamy, smoothie-like mango lassi. So rare it is now to find an authentic restaurant with fantastic food and superb personable service like what Lagnaa offers

The wife and I had a good meal there. It was different in that we sat on the floor and had the place to our selves. The food was good but unremarkable. With a bottle of wine, three dishes, two desserts, and an hour later, I was $155.00 poorer.
5
We dined here last week, and were very impressed with the dishes we ordered:1. Vegetable samosas (not the standard defrosted variety)2. Fish tikka (yum)3. Butter chicken (absolutely delicious)4. Eggplant/Brinjal curry (standout dish)The service was impressive from the moment we were seated, the wait staff were warm, enthusiastic and provided good recommendation including the Portuguese wine which I very much enjoyed. We were seated upstairs, a quieter area than below, with barefoot dining and seating on cushions with tables low to the floor. The intimate and casual feel made for a great dinning experience.Highly recommend this place and will certainly be returning the next time we are in Singapore
5
Nice place, extremely friendly staff and delicious food. I've tried tandoori fish and it was fabulous! Jusy and tasty. If you are not "hot chilly eater" this could be an option as other dishes tend to be hot. Highly recommend this place!
5
If you like the good indian food you must go to this restaurant! Excellent food and service! Very friendly atmosphere!
5
Enjoyed some very hot curry, very cold beer and warm service. Would happily return, but I don't think I'm tough enough for the full-moon curry challenge!
5
The food was superb and the staff were friendly and helpful - we were a party of 6 plus 2 children and they went out of their way to accommodate us. A must visit restaurant when you visit Singapore.
5
This is a hidden gem of a restaurant in Little india. The staff are just lovely, it is relaxed and casual and you can either eat upstairs barefoot on the floor or downstairs at table and chairs. Upstairs is air-conditioned and just really relaxed, with short tables and cushions, which was fun.The food is excellent, a must try is the yoghurt rice and the prawn curry. However all the food we had, was really good indian food. The atmosphere and friendly and very light hearted staff alone puts this place on the come again list

We visited this restaurant while on a guided tour through Little India, Singapore. The interesting part about this restaurant is the spiciness ladder and who have met the challenge and thus got a clothe peg on the line. We decided to go to Lagnaa for lunch after the guided tour as we wanted to try the barefoot dining room up on the second floor. You will have to remove your shoes as you will be sitting down on the ground. So if you are worried about adding additional "aroma" to the surrounding, stay on the first floor. The second floor is decorated simply and the tables are really low, thus the seats on the floor. There is a round padded mat for you to sit on but we were not used to sitting on the floor so we were shifting into different positions every few minutes.The food is very good. Had butter chicken, chicken masala, lamb and spinach with naan. We went for a the minimum level of spiciness and it is tolerable. According to the waitress, the chef can only take up to level 3. Oh, the waitress will sit down on the floor next to you to give you the menus and talk to you. It was very quiet for us that day and we had the whole room to ourselves until near the end of our meal when 2 other patrons came up. The down side of sitting upstairs is that they may forget you were there after they delivered the food. So if you need some thing, you might have to go back down. A "I need service" bell might be good thing to have.The lasi was very good and, according to someone who loves Indian food, best she has ever tasted.Tip - if you want to have a glass of cold water, just go to the back door that leads to the restroom and you will see glasses and a water dispenser, so you an get your own water any time

Have been visiting Lagnaa for about a year now and have a fantastic time every time! I recently visited and as it was my birthday month was treated to some wine. The service is so friendly, above any other I have received in Singapore. I always feel completely welcome. The food is wonderful, full of flavour with new options each month. I can't recommend a visit more

This is another gem in Little India. Unfortunately the upstairs section was booked out, but we managed to get a table downstairs. The waitress was exceptionally friendly and was readily available for any questions we had. The food was traditional and very tasty. Slightly pricy, but well worth it

Recently visited Lagnaa, as I always do when I visit Singapore. The staff are very friendly and the food is excellent, although I have not been able to exceed level 3 on the 'Chilli Score Board'.On this occasion was to celebrate my friend's birthday and we were surprised to be given a birthday desert plus a birthday card on which to draw an outline of my foot.Will definitely return and recommend to my friends
5
What a great place. We were the wimps who could only manage a 1.5 curry, but so full of flavour and fragrance were our chicken, aubergine and fish offerings - as well as our samosas - we saw no need to prove anything. The service was so friendly, the atmosphere fun, the chance to try some really flavoursome food not to be missed. Loved this place and recommended it to all and sundry during our stay in Singapore

Very friendly and helpful service, delicious food (especially the fish curry), and a lovely relaxed setting.

You enter this restaurant with barefoot and sit on the floor to dine! :-) A very different dining experience in SG.
Must try - Prawn Biriyani & Mutton Biriyani
Pros: Customized spice level for every diner & great service
4
A warm welcome and delicious curry to match. We dined upstairs in the aircon, sitting on cushions. Great selection of north and south indian food and beers with attentive and friendly service. Recommended.

My husband and I stumbled upon this place just walking around Little Italy. It was just so wonderful. The service was so amazing and the food was delicious!! We both love Indian food but always have problems knowing what to order. Our server was so helpful and really worked with us to help us pick our menu. We loved every bite! The atmosphere was great too... it was fun to sit on the floor barefoot! If you are ever in Singapore you HAVE to eat here... it's a Singapore must
5
The food is very authentic, and they have a nice "sit on the floor" concept in the second floor, which makes it a very relaxing nice experience. Its hard to find good north indian food in little india (or across Singapore), and Lagnaa's menu can get you the best Chicken Butter Masala in town. Try the yoghurt rice and ask Shanthi for some "good along" curries to go with it
5
The warm Santhi will welcome you into this charming restaurant. Try to book upstairs to enjoy the barefoot experience. Either she or any of her colleagues will guide you through their Indian dishes and the desired "spicy level". If you are in Singapore you have to visit this place

We came on a Tuesday for lunch. We were the only people in the restaurant. The place is really cute and clean. The service was friendly and efficient. The food and drinks we had had really amazing flavour. Although the portions were quite small and priced a little high for what you get. There is also free wifi at the restaurant.
5
We chose this place based on TA reviews and as luck would have it our hotel was just down the road. We wandered up in the afternoon to check it out and make a booking for that night. Met by a lovely man who upon learning that I was coeliac arranged to make a special semolina dish for me as I can't eat naan or roti. The upstairs area is very comfortable, in fact I'd rather sit barefoot on floor cushions than on some of the hard timber chairs found in some restaurants these days. The Mr struggled a little as he is not as flexible as I am! We really enjoyed our meals although I am a little regretful we played it safe and went for a spice level of 1.5, I think I could manage a 3 or 4 - I like a bit of kick! The service was excellent. You will pay a bit more here but IMO it's worth it for the treat. We are not big eaters so found one curry each with bread and rice was fine but if you are a big eater you might want to share 3 dishes between 2 people. Can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu
5
Good food can be found in many places these days; but good food alone does not a good restaurant make.A good restaurant provides also a great setting in which to enjoy a great meal, and this is exactly what Lagnaa offers. Not too may places offer barefoot dining, especially with the focus on safety in just about every aspect of modern life. Lagnaa manages this well, and this relaxed setting paves way to the delights which emanate from the kitchen.The attention of the staff, and the propensity to fully engage with guests further compliments the food quality and setting. They offer great advice, and will happily explain the chilli rating system. A note to fans - be sure you like hot food if you take on the higher levels of spice! For those that do enjoy hot food, your taste spuds are in for an absolute delight. For these who are not as fond, there is more than plenty to cater to this as well. Surely worthy of at least two visits in your next stopover, maybe more if you are a local

I ate here at a friends recommendation and it was everything that I was told to expect. TThe staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonable. It is a typical open front without air conditioning but, for me that wasn't a problem. Te food was very good, I had the the Mutton Marsala at a level 2 spice. It was very good but next time I will bump it up to 3 (there are 10 levels). Just for reference, I like spice and don't consider a jalapeÃ±o very hot. Like I said, I'll do a 3 next time, maybe work my way up to a 4. I highly recommend Lagnaa
5
This place is worth the time, especially when you're in the area.
The green tea is exceptionally memorable
4
Nice atmosphere, however a lot of tourist and expats. Food is nice. Friendly staff. I think it is a bit overpriced. But if you stay in the neighborhood definitively a nice place to have dinner
5
We got to this restaurant after reading positive online reviews. It met all of our expectations and even exceeeded them. we are a family of five and everyone had a blast. As we climbed barefoot to the second floor, it was well lit and air conditioned and seating on the pillows around the table was fun and unique. Calming Indian music was playing in the background The host Shanti came and sat with us, expained the menu and also took pictures of us. She gave us very personal service. The food was amazing and we kept ordering more and more. The deserts and tea at the end were also great. They also surprised my daughter who was celebrating her 13th birthday with a nice chocolate desert and a special greeting card. All in all, a great experience. We definitely recommend it to Singapore visitors. We also hope to return one day
5
We went here on our honeymoon and it was a perfect evening - ate upstairs in the air-conditioned dining room and had a truly memorable night; the chef even came out to wish us well!The staff could not have been nicer, and the same can be said of the food: flavoursome, punchy spicing, and light and clean - a world away from the ghee-laden goo that masquerades as Indian food in the UK.Try this unassuming little place if you want a warm welcome, and a warmer plate of authentic food in your belly! And the lethal strength Indian beers are a treat! Try the malty goodness that is Old Monk 10000!And for chilli fiends, there is a sliding scale of spice - dare you go for the record and try for a 10 point curry, a feat achieved by no one in the history of the restaurant? The best so far has been a 9, attained by one lunatic from Sydney (for reference, the chef won't go higher than three!)

Ordered butter chicken, dal makni, mutton dhal with butter naan and plain rice. After reading all reviews on tripadvisor, I was disappointed. Taste was ok not spectacular. Mutton not lean as it should be. I've had better Indian food in Madrid (a city with limited international cuisine)! Will not recommend it to friends. Will not be back.
5
I found the service, cleanliness and food quality excellent. I am usually quite an afficionado of spicy and generally 'local' food wherever I travel which so far is ~40 countries.I was somewhat skeptical as the well-spoken host sat down to describe the various levels on "hotness" my mutton could be prepared to. On a scale of 1.5 - 6, I chose 4. So did the tables to my left and right. Off in the corner another table selected a 5 while others were less aggressive.I thoroughly enjoyed the complex flavors to the mutton but have to admit hte spiciness was "challenging." I sweat through my shirt and hair. So did my neighbors. THe guy who ordered a 5 was still nipping on it when I left.The host was very friendly, even gave me an umbrella for the walk home. I told her I'm leaving tomorrow, there's no way I'm going to be able to return an umbrella." She still insisted I take it.I would definately come back and left a few cards at the Ritz for the Concierge
5
We went for an early weekend lunch, and the staff were amazingly friendly and accommodating of our toddler (the staff ended up playing with him as it was before the lunchtime rush).The food was excellent, especially the lamb tikka. Much better than the food that I'm used to back home
5
Sit upstairs and listen to your hostess, she is not kidding about the heat levels. Just go with her recommended heat level and you will be fine. I got to say I am impressed by the heat level that this place can offer. By all means be my guest to challenge your digestive system by daring to go beyond the base minimum heat level of 1.5 @ this place, but be warned that this will "cleanse your system".I was there on a full-moon night when they had the monthly Level 7 contest going on. God bless the people who graduated to level 7, I like to be at level 2. We stuck to the base heat levels and tried the Chicken tikka, Mutton masala and butter chicken along with the mango lassis and naan. Everything was amazing and to my surprise the 1.5 heat level was the most I could have asked for. Love what the chef has done with the menu, very classy and real
5
We discovered Lagnaa in April 2013 and have been 5 times since! The food is delicious, the prices are reasonable, the staff are so nice, and there is a lovely relaxed atmosphere. The bare foot dining and the Chilli Challenge add that little extra to the experience! We have been to wine tasting nights, have made it up to Level 5 on the chilli challenge and hope to try a cooking class which they host! On my boyfriends birthday he got a free bottle of wine and a delicious chocolate dessert with a birthday candle! Such a nice touch. Highly recommend Lagnaa

Well, until we got the cheque this had been a terrific experience - great food, very charming welcome, good service, etc. etc. But S$86 for two (large) beers, three dishes, and a couple of nan!!!!!!! We paid the same amount for a meal at Boat Quay in an upscale Italian restaurant. No matter how great the food no one would describe this little backstreet place as upscale. Still, no regrets about going. Seems to sum up Singapore - very very good; very very very expensive

It does provide traditional barefoot dining. However, the service is not great, the food is average and the portions are small. The ambience is ok. I am not sure I would frequent this place.
5
Barefoot dining was the highlight and the most memorable experience of our weekend trip to Singapore with my in-laws and our 14-month old! It was recommended to us by a friend who used to live in Singapore who told us there is upstairs seating - if he hadn't told us, we would've just thought it was a tiny, hole-in-the-wall, sweaty little Indian place with 4 tables crammed into the ground floor with some ceiling fans. We took off our shoes and immediately headed upstairs to the barewood floors and were instantly relieved by the air conditioning. However, to my dismay, my husband said we wouldn't be able to sit here because the little one would wreak havoc as the tables and the cutlery (spoons, forks) were at the perfect heigh for him to destroy everything. So with a big sigh we trekked back downstairs and crammed into a tiny 4-person table that was obviously built for tiny Asian people who like to rub (sweaty) elbows and sweated our way through ordering from the menu. Luckily, the marketing manager, who is absoultely LOVELY, asked us why we weren't sitting upstairs since there is so much more space for the little one to run around. When we mentioned our concern for the cutlery, she said she could clear them from all the tables (there was no one upstairs although all the tables downstairs were taken). Fantastic! We skipped happily back up the stairs. Sure enough, the little one started grabbing the cutlery from the table next to us but after those were gone, he was surprisingly good and didn't play at the other tables.We had a lovely meal with 3 curries and 2 vegetable dishes, perfect for the 4 of us adults. Our son was content eating the crunchy popadoms and drinking our mango lassis. After our meal, the marketing manager lady (who used to be a school teacher) came over to us with a balloon she blew up for him to play with. She was awesome and totally in love with him, helping us keep him entertained while the adults ate! By now, our son was bold enough to walk up and down the 2nd floor and play, including wandering over to another table and playing with another couple who were eating there. We've had Indian loads of times before so I chose a selection of lamb, chicken, fish and vegetable curries for us to eat but I did notice that the marketing manager took her time to explain and suggest dishes to those not having had Indian much before. After eating, we had that "I've eaten too much" feeling you often get after eating Indian food, so we just sat there on the cushions on the floor, dazed, while we watched our son playfully walking back and forth. It was a lovely building that was tastefully decorated and highlighted the architecture of these lovely old buildings. There's also a 3rd floor with 3 x 4-person tables, also cozy-looking and perfect for booking a private party. IN SUMMARYA perfect place to take the little ones for tasty food and a great, relaxing experience during the day

I had my most awesome bday surprise at lagnaa barefoot dining, the food was fantastically superb and their spice challenge is something that makes u wana go there again. Their hospitality is something to look forward to, overall I had a wonderful dining experience there... From: Gun

We found this restaurant through Trip Advisor and decided to give it a go, we were not disappointed! From the outside it looks like any of the other places to eat around little india however once we were upstairs my view totally changed. We hadnt booked a table however they still managed to fit us in even though they were visibly busy. The food was lovely, some of the best indian food i have tasted. The portions were just right, not too big but just enough for one. I couldnt fault any part of our meal/experience, all the staff were very friendly. When we mentioned it was our honeymoon, they went out of their way to to make us feel at home.When we return to singapore we will definately be coming back here
5
If you want Indian food in Singapore you can't go past this restaurant on Upper Dickson Road right in the heart of little India. Home style Indian cooking at its best, even the kids can enjoy because their butter chicken and other mild dishes are very kid friendly.Highly recommend it, our favorite family restauran
5
Discovered this place a few weeks ago and have been twice since, and we are back tomorrow. Great food, great owner, and the chilli challenge is a nice touch to make things a little more interesting. I have only managed a #4 so far and it was HOT! Hats off to the 1 man who managed a #9. Highly recommended anyway, give it a go

My wife and I visited Lagnaa during our honeymoon in Singapore recently. We had read about the chili challenge, and both being pepperheads, we had to try it. Per the house rules, we were allowed to try up to level 6 on our first visit, so we selected two different chicken dishes at level 6. Usually, when we order food extra hot at restaurants, we're dissapointed, but not here. The dishes were both delicious and hot enough to satisfy our hot pepper cravings. We eagerly cleaned our plates, and got clothespins on the wall to mark our accomplishment. I suppose anything hotter would start to push the pain envelope, but then, that's why it's a chilli challenge. Unfortunately, living 10,000 miles away, we aren't able to frequent Lagnaa, so it wil be difficult to move up the wall towards level 10. Oh, well. Hopefully we'll make it back on a full moon one of these days and continue the challenge.Shanti was a great hostess, and treated us extra nice for our honeymoon. Thanks for a great meal
4
I highly recommend their food and customer service. The people who work for Lagnaa are exceptional when it comes to service. The good is really tasty and worth the money. It is more pricey compared to the food you can get at Little India - but your few extra dollars will be well spent. Don't miss the butter chicken
4
We are already familiar with Indian food, especially in Singapore. The good point with this restaurant is that you can choose your spice level. One of the best butter naans I ever had, good paneer butter masala, great for vegetarians ! They also have a great choice of Indian beers. Next time we hope we will join the food tasting session! Staff is very friendly and speaks good English.Sitting on the terrace is also cool, street is quiet and you can enjoy the street scenes

I have been to this restaurant 3 or 4 times, including a food tasting session.  On every occasion we have loved it apart from today. I did even write a review in the past but my opinions have changed.  My parents were staying in Singapore and we wanted to take them to Laagnas because of our past experiences.  We booked a table over the phone for upstairs in the barefoot dining area.  On every previous occasion Shanti has served us and I believe she is co-manager.  Tonight we were served by a gentleman who I believe to be the boss.  The staff here are very helpful, they like to tell you all about the food, which we have found to be really nice.  Previously we also loved how their spice chart system worked.  Tonight was a different experience.We were given the drinks menu and I told the guy I normally have a Haywards 5000 strong beer ($12 each) but wondered what the other strong beers were like? He suggested I try a Godfather beer. I suggested we order 3 but he said it was better to order a bucket because it was cheaper. When our drinks came there were 3 different beers (only one being a Godfather). I asked the waiter (not the main guy) about this and he said all the drinks were of similar quality so we just decided to have them.  Later we noticed a bucket cost $44 but the 3 beers I initially wanted to order would have cost a total of $36, this was not cheaper.  It's only a small amount so we just left it but we did become more annoyed by this guy.The main guy didn't really give us time to have a good look at the menu and he said he would bring us a chili sample dish so we could accurately select our spice level for our order.  We did wonder about whether this would be charged but actually thought that it was free! It looked nice so we ate it.  At no point were we asked if we wanted this and genuinely were made to feel that this was a service they did to help customers select the correct chili level.  It was such a tiny portion that surely it was not going to be charged?  We all selected our spice levels and informed the guy.The guy came back to take our order and was very pushy in telling us what we should and shouldn't have. It was odd and we were all looking at each other wondering why he was telling us what to order in this way, not just being helpful but purposely telling us what we would like and not like! He actually told my mom "no you won't like that".  We all felt very awkward as he was far too quick to make selections for us.  We knew the food was good so genuinely felt that we should trust the guys recommendations and that he was making them in a kind manner.  After we chose a main dish each and a side dish each the guy said something I was taken aback by. He said that we needed to order something else because we didn't have enough food!  I said we would have another rice and he said "no, not carbs, you need to order 2 more main dishes".  This I found to be totally wrong, I said we had been before and felt fine with the portion size but he insisted we still ordered at least one small dish off the specials menu as a starter. We felt pressured into this and again, as we had been before we just ordered it and didn't really want to question him.  He said, this would be okay to start and we could order more later!!  At this point we then felt very awkward and suspicious of this guy. It was only now we started wondering about the way he encouraged us to have a beer bucket.  On a previous visit we then remembered how our food was brought out and moments later told that our spice level was wrong and if we wanted we could order some raita to help lower the spice level...was this a ploy just to get more money from us?? On that occasion I just ate my curry at the higher spice level and didn't think anything of it.The food came and you can see the spice levels clearly because they put a small leaf sticking up per level.  However, the spice levels were all wrong compared to what we asked for.  Plus, two dishes of the same spice level tasted massively different in heat.  Again, we didn't want to say anything as the main dishes were decent despite the strange spice levels and we were all sharing anyway.  The guy had told us all the food was cooked fresh to order but our two rice dishes seemed cold and our naan bread was extremely dry which suggests to me that it was not made fresh.  You can go to the tekka center just outside Laagna and get amazing garlic naan bread made in a large bin in front of your eyes, why would anyone pay for Laagnas dry tasteless naan bread? Again, as we had been before and was treating my parents we didn't really want to complain.We finished our food and at no point were we asked how our food was. The restaurant was not busy.  As we were upstairs there were no staff to ask to get the bill so we decided to go downstairs and get the bill.  On the bill we had been charged for the chili level sample starter dish (that was forced on us basically) and it was clear to see that the larger bucket was more expensive than the 3 beers I wanted to order.  I made our feelings very clear to him and to Shanti and he pretty much just told us that we can always say no.  He very cleverly worked us to achieve a slightly better order than we would have ordered on our own and we heard him being pushy with other customers.  Im sure if he does this to every table every night then the place will be making a larger profit. Yes, we could have said no but we felt obliged to follow his recommendations as we had been before.  We paid the total bill because the food was generally nice and at the end of the day we did eat/drink it all but anyone visiting this place should be vary carefully when ordering and checking the bill.  Don't expect loyalty as a returning customer and they clearly mislead customers into ordering more off the menu.We won't return to Laagnas, which is a great shame because the food is generally pretty good. There are many good Indian food options in Singapore so won't miss it but we will not stand this sort of sneaky service.  My parents were stood waiting while I was discussing all this with the staff and the main guy who served us even approached them to ask if they had made a reservation, which just shows how much attention he was paying.  This guy spoilt the normally cheery atmosphere this place has and frustrated us to the point where even small negative issues became bigger. I guess it's one of those greedy places that just see so many rich expats paying for their bills without even looking.  If you want good Indian food with good honest service then I advise you don't go to Laagna Barefoot dining in Singapore

I do not argue about the quality of food, but all the same be warned that everything costs twice as much as in other restaurants in Litte India. That's why I never saw local people sitting at this restaurant, just tourists.
4
More pricey than most of Little india, however it's made to order, authentic and top quality. The lady waiting on us was attentive and likable. Definitely recommend.
5
I love this place as not only is the food ala carte (cook upon ordering), but the food is NOT oily... I always thought that Indian food MUST be oily as I have tried in alot places...The food here is not oily and I have to say the quality is good.I ordered fish curry at Level 3, yoghurt rice and ice lemon tea. This restaurant is rather busy, so have to wait for the food at times. They seem shorthanded so I just waited for the food while watching the people go by.If you are someone who loves quality Indian food (not all curry contains coconut and not all curry are spicy, that is what i realised)... go to Lagnaa.Adios

My wife and I visited on March 15, 2013. The vegetarian food we ordered was non-descript and way over-priced (50 SGD for a meal that cost 15 SGD on Race Course Rd. and far better). The service was just average (we ate downstairs). The restuarant's only other patrons were Westerners. We have come to learn that the best Indian food is where Indians eat--unfortunately this was not the case at Lagnaa
1
This place has become too successful for its own good. Frustrating service with extremely average food at ridiculous prices. The minute morsels of chicken that made for a chicken curry were laughable as were the few cubes of Paneer that made for our other dish. Then we had the bread - any restaurant that thinks it is acceptable and justifiable to charge $8 for a Roomali Roti needs a sanity check. The fact is there are 100's of restaurants in Singapore and plenty in Little India that will not rip you off and tell you to fetch your own glass of water (from upstairs) when you have just paid $85 for a meal
5
Really enjoyed eating here. Chilli chicken starter was so tender and considering it was one of the milder dishes (1.5 on the chilli scale) still had a kick. Awesome mutton masala (I went for a 4 on the chilli scale) and was perfect. Meat fell to pieces and the sauce was thick and not oily at all. Garlic naan was really good too. The portions don't look huge, but boy I was still full hours later and in hind site you wouldn't want more. Also had a Gulab Jamun for desert that melted in the mouth, and it had a great twist using Baileys instead of the usual syrup. Great resteraunt and the owner and staff were lovely

I have been traveling to Singapore for three years. I did discover this restaurant because of reviews from tripadvisor. First time Lagnaa did not look anything special, and I was not sure that this would be a good choice. BUT WHAT a mistake to think so ! From the first time I did eat here, I always come back everytime I am in Singapore. I am from Norway and I have traveled many places around the world, and I can say from my bottom of my heart - this is by far the best Indian I have tried in Singapore. Also since I am a Indian food lover, this is absolutely one of my favorites top 3 in the world (from my experience in the places I have been). What I love most is the splendid food, that always is "top notch". Some will call it "pricy" in Little India, but it is worth every penny.My best recommendation is to have a seat at the table outside on the pavement, and just enjoy the atmosphere in the streets while eating. K7 and Shanti is nice to talk to and they always remember you from last visit. I am in Singapore sometimes every year. Maybe you can get better food, better surroundings, better location for some, but the total picture of being in little India, eating at Lagnaa with all natural spices, the warm hospitality - can not be found in any combination !I rate the food as 5 points, this is compared also with Mumbai - where they all say is very authentic (of course since it is in India). The spices and flavor are absolutely "world class" at Lagnaa..... I will soon be arriving in Singapore again, and I can´t wait to be there enjoying my next splendid meal here !I am above average "food lover" and really want to take some cooking classes, but I have not had the time to do so yet. One day I will, and I can´t wait !Best regards Thornado from Norway...

I'm proud to be a grandma and have met other ones here. The restaurant caters to everyone including families, singles and seniors. The staff are all so patient and kind, explaining the many different dishes. Most fun was one of the cooking classes. It was an excellent class, fun and very much a good value! You can be lucky enough to be on a 'tasting committee' and vote on your favorites for the next months specials. It was a blast! The panel was very young, and my age, singles and couples. Great way to meet new friends. I was there again today and must say "Wow! another great meal". The tandoori mixed grill, yogurt rice and cranberry naan accompanied with an ice cold beer! Every order is fresh made (not sitting under heat lights) and NO MSG
5
Having eaten at Lagnaa regularly over the past 18 months, I would like to respond to some of the negative comments. Yes, for the amount and price you can get more and cheaper at other restaurants in Little India, just look for the B or C sanitation rating. The difference is Lagnaa cooks to order with no MSG. You can go to other establishments and get a beer or bottle of wine cheaper because Lagnaa does not get the quantity discounts as larger establishments. The "Western" toilet is upstairs for those tourists who rarely travel - along with the air conditioning. As for all the "foreigners" you see in the restaurant, most of them are locals not tourists. As for the owner ( K7) Yes, he will take issue with impolite comments from a "first timer" with "attitude" - so will every other owner of a restaurant I have eaten in all over the world. There is a reason Lagnaa has a loyal following who are willing to pay "more" - BECAUSE IT'S WORTH IT 
5
The ratings are well deserved. Just a few doors off the main street in a character shop house. Recommend you go upstairs abd sit on the floor. Here each dish is cooked to order. They go to a lot of trouble to discuss with you your chilli level ans soon after the most beautiful fragrant food arrives
5
I found this small family owned place by accident in 2007 whilst trying to navigate the maze of Little India. It is in a beautiful old shop house with open front seating down stairs and a "barefoot" dining area on the first floor. Here you leave your shoes on the stairs and sit on cushions on the floor eating off low tables. The food is excellent and curry strength runs from 1 to 6, except once a month on full moon night when they do special curries up to strength 10. I have only ever made it to level 4. I did try a spoon full of 6 and it blew my sox off. Perhaps that's why they insist you take your shoes off first. Food is served by the very lovely Shanti and accompanied by a selection of great Indian beer. The Kingfisher Extra Strong is highly recommended but after a couple of bottle it can be a bit tricky getting off the floor. After a great meal you can write your name on the wall downstairs and those who manage a strength 4 or above curry get their name on a close peg which hangs on the wall. I love this place so much I go there every time I am in Singapore

Great Food, esp. the butter chicken...but actually just everything was really tasty with a perfect spicyness. The service is equally great - really friendly and helpful.Even though we only spend 4 days in Sinpagore, we just had to go there twice because the food was just too good
5
Great location, super service and amazing food without having to remortgage your home. The spice test is a a fun idea so you can enjoy your curry without pain. We sat downstairs to soak up the atmosphere of Little India and I would recommend this. Terrible wine list but that's my fault for not wanting beer

My husband & I came here after reading trip advisor reviews & we weren't disappointed. The two lady hostesses were so friendly & explained the menu thoroughly with the spiciness grading system from 1 - 10 (No one has ever managed to eat a 10 & only one person has mananged a 9)! We both love spicy food but the 3 was hot enough for me & the hubby had to order a mango lassi after the 4 proved a little hotter than expected! The flavours in all of the dishes we tried were so wonderfully different from what we've tasted before & if we were staying longer in Singapore we would definitely come back! Thank you!
5
From the moment I stepped in, till the last goodbye , it has been a great experience. Loved everything about the place - great food (level 2 is enough) for me, very hospitable staff& well-thought through concepts. Couldn't resist ordering Ice Chocolate They have so many interesting events going on too! I signed up for Food Tasting. You should too

Quite frankly we were appalled. One comes to expect service in Singapore restaurants, it's pretty scanty here. We walked past the place early in the evening, glanced at the unusual and tempting menu and were sold the idea by a cheerful and friendly lady, explaining that we had business elsewhere first and would return in an hour or so. Upon returning we were given a table, handed a menu and ordered two beers - which I might add were considerably more expensive than many other local establishments. Over the next half hour we tried many times to attract a waiter's attention to place a food order - no reaction whatsoever, not even a "Be with you in a minute Sir." Therefore after finishing our drinks I went to the pay desk and said I'd pay for the two beers and call it a day. They even had the gall to try and add a service charge!Little India is an amazing area full of some great restaurants, many of which feature excellent welcome, service and food. Maybe the food here is good, I don't know and doubt I ever will. There's enough competition around here not to return to a place that doesn't want your business
5
Ate here on the 1st of February after spotting the spice challenge, (i like spicy food) The service was excellent and very friendly, just know what your spice level is. If you can handle food ask for spicy, but be realistic too. I ate with two friends, I had really spicy, loved it, one person had mid level spice, he also loved it, the other had a dish with no spice and loved it too. Not anymore expensive then the surrounding restaurants, I would definitely recommend trying this restauran
2
The food is okay, but over priced. The general atmosphere is pretentious, and probably the least authentic indian eating experience in little india. The "chilli meter" seems like something that is good for luring in customers, but honestly who wants to eat really spicy food if it's not got more to it than that. Bite on a chilli instead...
5
Was here back in December. Staff were very friendly. There Garlic Naan was very Garlicky (important) and Butter Chicken was Buttery (also important). Favourite dish was the mutton masala. I would be back time and time again if I lived in Singapore and be there next time I return. The Masala Tea is a must. C

After wandering through the back streets of Little India, four of us stumbled across this charming "bare foot" dining restaurant. Lunchtime loomed so we ventured inside. Reading the hand writing all over the walls covered in along with the large Chilli rating scale was pre lunch entertainment. Two in our party were keen to make it onto the Chilli rating board but after reading the ratings where a little shy! Food and hospitality lovely. Do try this restaurant if you are in Little India. I would dine here again
5
excellent food, well priced.
take the chili test to qualify for the heat contest
the woman who owns and runs the place is lovely
5
Staff very friendly. Other diners cheer when you finish a level 6 curry - honour board presents a friendly challenge to all diners! Not to be missed!
5
My girlfriend and I visited Lagnaa last night after it was recommended to us. It is very near little india MRT station but not obvious to find even when standing outside the place. There is a downstairs (seated area) and upstairs (no shoes) area. It is very rustic but has real character. The owners and staff are so helpful and kind. They discuss the food in great detail and are clearly very proud, and rightfully so! There was a large selection of drinks, I particularly enjoyed some authentic strong Indian beer! All the food comes with a Chili level from 0-10. Zero is literally no chili at all which is good as many people ask for food to be hot in some places and it still ends up being mega hot. I had a curry at level 3 but probably could have had it at level 5, it's a very accurate system I think. They do special tasting sessions each month so the specials are all chosen by members of the public who get invited to a tasting session, again this was a nice touch. So all in all superb food, decent prices in what is an Indian food paradise area anyway....highly recommended
4
The food was delicious although the portions were quiet small compared to the price. The place is buzzing, so make a reservation is you wish to make it to the upstairs tea tables. The staff is very attentive and friendly and the decoration suits the traveler vibe of challenges and quirkiness!
5
During a stroll through Little India nearly a year ago I accidentally stumbled upon this place - I now stop in at least 3-4 times a month to feed my addiction to good Indian food. The food is simply amazing with many unique dishes to choose from. The staff is very friendly and the Master Chef (K7) REALLY REALLY knows Indian food. If you prefer A/C and the "barefoot" experience, make sure to sit upstairs. If you want to take in the action in Little India while having a curry and a Kingfisher, sit in the downstairs section. This place is simply a must go for those that appreciate a good curry and a few beers at a reasonable price

The incentive was to a have a barefoot dining experience but it almost turned out to be a 'foot in mouth' experience. To begin with, the waiting and serving staff is friendly but not well-informed, They choose not to tell you the restaurant food policies conveniently so that later you can be penalized for the same. The restaurant follows a spice chart which we were not informed about at all. We were told the rating is from 1 to 5 and we thought that 3 would be the average. So we ordered a 3 and a 4 of Veg Jalfrezi which turned out to be a broth of raw red chilli powder with no taste of vegetables leading to palette irritation during consumption. Paapads and pickles were kept on the table as soon as we sat down and it being an Indian restaurant, we thought they were complimentary but they were not. A second round of paapads were served to us which was apparently for another table and at the billing time it was told to us that we should have informed that the order did not belong to us. All the chutneys, paapads and pickles are sweetly labelled as "open food" on the bill. When we enquired about the same, they said this was normal. I asked them to point out where these charges were printed on the bill and they had no answer to it. If you have a term called as 'open food', learn to be open about it.Last but not the least, when our feedback was asked and we gave a feedback stating that the spices were not cooked, we were told by the head chef that "we were punching way above our weight levels" and that we were eligible for a 2 or a 1.5 and that the food item tastes just fine. Such a cocky attitude is not really cared for in customer service industry and be rest assured, that we would, without any struggle, forget the path to this restaurant
4
Barefoot dining is a lovely way to spend an evening, the staff are welcoming and kind and without some of the attitude experienced elsewhere in Singapore. The food was better than any Indian food I had eaten in London and the unique wall on which customers can write reviews or comments is lovely to read as you are waiting for your chilli challenge
4
We have just returned from Singapore, we love indian food and this restaurant serves very good food indeed. The lovely staff are just so welcoming and funny with smiles all night, thankyou as it is so rare to find this type of service anymore.We tried some of the recommended monthly dishes but we reckon it would all be great as is all cooked fresh. Try level 2 chilli only as we do hot and their hot is hotter than ours!Atmosphere downstairs was ok, probably much more fun and cooler in the a/c upstairs with a gang of friends, though the wall art is interesting. Will be back

My partner and I went to Lagnaa on Christmas eve 2012. It was very quiet as everyone was getting ready to go out to party for the night but as we had just got into Singapore from London that afternoon and still jet-lagged we were happy for an early dinner and bed. Do not let the small restaurant (8m by 3m) deter you or if they have little clientele: the food was absolutely amazing and definitely what we were looking for as we wanted to try food local to the country. If you are not staying in Little India (where the restaurant is located) the nearest MRT (metro) station is Little India Exit E to Kerbau Road. Lagnaa is situated at No. 6 Upper Dickson Road. The Chilli Board is a must try for anyone with a tough palate. Chilli number 2 on the board was hot enough for both my partner and I and we always try to go hotter when ordering a curry in England. The staff were so friendly and almost surprised at having non-locals wanting to eat at the restaurant as they mostly have locals eat there - which is a good sign for the food to be very local. Absolutely amazing, I would have gone back again the next night but we wanted to try as many different things as possible. We found this restaurant through travelers tips on Tripadvisor and can see why it is one of the top-rated restaurants located in Little India
5
That's it - Wow. We stopped here for lunch after a hot and tired morning of wandering the streets of Little India. We just wandered in. We didn't want to eat at a hawker stall, the food at the stalls is great and the prices are very low, but we wanted to sit and relax and it's hard to that at a hawker stall. Lagnaa was a great find. It's on Upper Dickson Road, so it's a block or two off Dunlop Street, Little India's sort of main street where a lot of restaurants, bars and backpacker hostels are. The food was great, the best we had in Singapore, a city of great food. We ate lite, chicken curry, somosas and naan. Each was terrific. The chicken curry was ordered at spice level 2 (out of 10) but it would have been at least 4 or 5 anywhere else. It was quite spicy but very tasty. The manager can explain the spice level in very specific terms using the Scoville scale. If you like spicy food talk to her before going off the deep end. The somosas were incredible. Flaky pastry wrapped around a sumptuous mixture of vegetables. The naan was light and puffy and equally tasty. The food was excellent, the setting charmingly funky (the walls are covered with comments left by customers) and the conversation (with the manager) very pleasant. All in all, a good find and a place we really enjoyed
4
Nice Place with Good Food. If you like hot and spicy Indian Food you should go there. We Tried Butter chicken and chicken kadhai. Great!
5
I went with my family to Lagnaa after hearing so much about it from my office colleagues. We chose to sit downstairs as mum has leg problems. (Upstairs was barefoot dining - sitting on the floor). We ordered some of the Chef's Specials & chose only a very low spice level after trying the Chilli Chicken. They also had some dishes on the Monthly Specials & we tried both the Mango Chicken & Coriander Rice. It is usually difficult to please my mum but she loved the food so much especially the Coriander Rice that we ordered another. The naans were soft & the food simply fabulous. Loved the place, the service & the food! Great combination! Will come back for more & this time sit upstairs
5
The food at Lagnaa is the best Indian I have ever had. Just don't go too spicy or you're in trouble as my fiance found out!There is a variety of Southern Indian food on the menu - I recommend the Butter Chicken or the Pepper Chicken. The garlic naan is so good that my father in law said it's the best bread he has had in his 70+ years!We thought the price of the food was quite reasonable. Only downside is that both times we have been there it has taken awhile to get our bill. They don't seem to want you to leave!Highly recommended

Tucked away in a corner in Singapore's Little India, this restaurant is housed in a two - storeyed, rather unassuming building. The highlight of the restaurant is that you can't take your foot wear to the dining area. Good Indian food served, warm and hospitable staff. A tad bit expensive for the servings. A nice place to take your friends who love Indian food.
3
Lagnaa is a restaurant which is likely to get strong opinions from people who visit, and I suspect the views are likely to be quite divergent. It seems to be building a somewhat unique business model, clearly trying to get the word out online, through friends at sites like TripAdvisor. Without these, it would be a hard-to-find restaurant, not only because of its location, but also due to the fact that the name of the restaurant is not even written in English at its entrance. I suspect that it is likely to be an unusual dining experience for non-Indians (sitting cross-legged on the floor), but most Indians won't probably find it that unusual. On to the food itself: it isn't all that bad, though not spectacular. It IS spicy though and certainly not recommended for people with a sensitive palate. We went at lunch time, and the place was empty. We had three pieces of bread, a couple of vegetarian dishes and one chicken dish (the dishes are small). No drinks. This set us back about S$40, or about 20 bucks a head. They are clearly selling an experience, because for that price, we could have had a lunch buffet at far-superior choices like the Song of India.One thing that upset us though: they will tack on charges for basic things without warning you, so please don't assume that even the tap water is free. For example, we asked for warm water (common in all Singapore restaurants), and were shocked to find a $3.50 charge because they brought it in a pot (to their credit, though, they took off charges)

I'm currently living in Singapore for a few months & have been to Laagna on several occasions with a group of friends. It's a small & unassuming place with tables downstairs & bare foot, seating on the floor upstairs which is nice but could do with some thicker & bigger cushions on the wooden floor!The staff are all so friendly & willing to chat & laugh. The service is also pretty quick unless its really busy & then you have to wait a while like you would in any restaurant. I would say the food is pretty good. There's a wide choice & you can pick your spice level which is great. The portions are a little small which is a shame as they're quite tasty. For me, it's a nice place to eat & I would go back, but it's no better than some others I've been to which were better value for money. I don't think it's worth the major hype, but it's a nice place to go.
5
Tried the chocolate and cranberry naans, which I felt were novel ingredients to add to naans but the result was a delicious dish. Definitely something kids and kids at heart would enjoy. The lassi drinks were yummy and refreshing,especially in this humid weather. I enjoyed the mango and lime lassi drinks the most. Service was also top-notch! The hostesses were extremely warm and inviting and took time to explain the items on their menu in great detail. The spice level concept is a good idea as we can customize the spiciness of the dish.They also provided good recommendations with regards to our spice tolerance and had good knowledge of their dishes (something I greatly appreciate in restaurants).In all,this was an enjoyable and delicious meal,made complete with a friendly and warm service

Living in Singapore, I had to try the "famous Lonely Planet" restaurant, Lagnaa. The staff was fabulously friendly, the most wonderful wait staff I have had since moving to Singapore. Really, they are very nice and love their workplace. The upstairs area is quite small and part of it was leaking on our visit due to rain and the age of the building. The tables are very very small. It's hard to even fit the drinks on so we were wondering how our food would fit. We were surprised by what seemed to be good prices, only 7-8 dollars for vegetarian entrees. We wondered how all the food we were going to order would fit on the table. When the food came, it was on a lazy Susan with TINY amounts. If we had loved the food it would not have been enough! Simple inaccuracies in the menu were irritating to people like us who know Indian cuisine. (Vegetable pakora was actually a fritter with frozen mixed vegetables instead of the Indian style tempura. No excuse for lack of ingredients, they can buy everything in Little India....Baby potatoes in sauce were not baby potatoes but rather mashed potato balls with raisins inside, yuck!) Wonderful waitstaff, the food, value and atmosphere was not good. We felt rather fleeced when we left.
3
An extremely warm welcome awaits you at Lagnaa. Friendly staff can help you navigate the menu and level of spiciness. It's a safe, first-time choice for those unfamiliar with Indian food; children would enjoy the experience. No, it's not as cheap nor as authentic as other nearby choices across the road or around the corner. But sometimes a pleasant smile beats a stark fast-food canteen
3
I was disappointed by the food after having read all the good reviews. It is really just average and very costly as the plates are very small. However, the ambiance is nice and the service is really friendly. To me, they need to upgrade the food. I will not be back
4
we had a great time here. the staff were friendly. we were a bit confuse what to have and they manage to helm us into the right direction. we very much enjoyed our tandoori.
2
Yes, the service is charming, but the prices are high for suspect food quality. There was a big sign on the wall recruiting for a curry and tandoor chef. Until that sign is taken down, you should assume the worst of this kitchen. I got sick within two hours after eating a fish curry that tasted sketchy from the first bite. Too authentic, in the wrong way
3
Average food excellent service ... Rather it be the other way around ....sitting on the floor is uncomfortable as the tables were not made for this as in Japanese establishments .we could not eat downstairs as there was a cooking school.the dishes the food was served in was curved and awkward and belonged to the 1970s fondue brigad
5
Ate here with my husband, we stayed in a hotel nearby and passed this restaurant a few times, the chili chart on the wall is what attracted me to this place. The food was excellent, fresh and clean. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the different extremes of chili that they offer for some of the dishes. I love hot and spicy food but opted for a level three, after eating my chicken masala, I think I could have gone up to a level five and no further, three was already intense. Every full moon they have competitions where level seven through ten is served for those who are brave enough. I highly recommend this place for the variety of northern and southern Indian dishes, wonderful taste and of course for the chili
3
For many people not familiar with the culture visiting an Indian restaurant can be a little intimidating, however the friendly staff at Lagnaa make selecting great tasting Indian cuisine easy.The service is excellent and the staff exceptionally friendly without being over the top. The restaurant is exceptionally clean, but sparsely decorated.We had prawn masala, thakalli tikka chicken and aloo gobbi, along with some naan and tandoor prata. The food was quite good, but not the best Indian I have eaten. You can select the spice level of the food - we chose 3/10 and I have to say that even though I love spicy food it still had my nose running by the end of the meal. Consider yourself warned.One let down was that the food was quite expensive. Compared to other restaurants around the area out bill of S$50 was a bit of a surprise. One thing to note when you sit down they will serve you poppadams which you assume are complimentary - our bill showed they were actually S$1.50.Overall we felt a little disappointed - we felt like we had paid about $20 more than the meal was worth - for example a Moroccan meal in Kampong Glam two nights previous had been $38 for a much bigger meal with entree.
5
My wife and I were in Singaore for a week and went here on recommendation from a Wanderlust Hotel pamphlet. We were not disappointed, delicious food, very friendly waitress and staff, and a little bit different to other restaurants. May be a little more expensive than other places but compared to Australia where we came from, still very cheap. You have to try the kulfi for dessert, absolutely amazing. If we ever go back to Singapore for a holiday would definitely go there again. I chose 2 as the spice rating for my chicken curry, and was quite hot so advise not to go over 2 if you don't like your food too spicy
5
What a fantastic find! Not only was the food outstanding, the service was faultless. The lady who owns the restaurant greeted us like long lost friends and made us feel so welcome. The menu was explained to us and we were told about the chilli rating. Well, thank god we were because we went for a 2 rating and a 1.5 - both of which are hot in comparison to what you would expect on a scale of 1 - 10! That being said it was perfect for us. So tasty and the Aloo Ghobi was a particular highlight for me along with the fab naan bread. If you are in Singapore and fancy a curry, this is the only place you should visit. I will be recommending this restaurant to anyone who visits Singapore, it really is a must see place.
3
we went there following strong reco from tripadvisor reviewers. Indeed service was very kind but frankly the setting is ok at best and food is average. we tried appetizers - chili chicken and veg set. the first one was very testy making us feel like it will be great diner but it was where the great food stopped. veg set was tasteless. chef speciality (mutton in spices) was spicy but nothing else. also spinach with cottage cheese was rather tasteless. net, a bit of disappointment
5
As my 14-month-old daughter and I walkeded up and down the streets looking for a place with good (and not spicy) curry, we finally stumbled upon this little restaurant called Lagnaa on Upper Dickson Road. The only reason we stopped here was because there was a lovely woman out in front who came to ask us if we had questions about the menu. I told her we wanted a good chicken curry that wasn't spicy. She said, "Try the Butter Chicken Curry". Done.This dish was probably one of the best curries I've ever had! It was so flavorful, and not at ALL spicy (I don't do spicy), but you can get the dishes to any level of "spicy" you'd like. Linna also had some of the chicken curry, but she REALLY loved the Papadum, which is a crispy bread made with lentils. The Papadum came with a mint dipping-sauce that was to DIE for. The nice woman who helped me select my meal also recommended their Lime Juice to drink. OMG yum! It was so refreshing, sweet, and ice cold. Linna sat so nicely in the chair next to me (they don't have highchairs because the restaurant can only fit about 25 people), while the ladies in the restaurant entertained her, and I devoured my delicious food.Read about our entire experience in Little India on my blog: http://minnesotababy.blogspot.sg/2012/10/little-india.htm

We found this restaurant on Trip Advisor & decided to go. We found the service to be amazing - super friendly & helpful when ordering. We sat upstairs where you do sit on the floor but this just adds to the atmosphere. We ordered 2 meat dishes & 2 vegetarian dishes plus naan and roti & 3 drinks and it was S$53. We found the food to be delicious, must try is the butter chicken. Would highly recommend
5
Great cozy environment, amazing food, very laid back ambiance. All in all, the perfect place to go and have a relaxed fantastic Indian food delight!
Strongly recommend

We ate here last night and were very impressed. We had two large beers, 1 chicken appetiser, 1 (spice level 4 soooo hot!) lamb curry, 1 vegetable curry, naan & rice with a chocolate fondue for dessert which came in at around $85 which is pretty decent when you take in to account how heavily taxed alcohol is in Singapore. The owners are wonderful people & were really helpful suggesting places for us to visit. Would definitely recommend. A++
5
We first looked at this place because we were staying at wanderlust around the corner who recommended it. however we nearly skipped it because the doenstairs didnt look very enticing wirh yellow tiles on the walls. Once upstairs though the ambiance is completely different - you sit on little tables on the floor barefoot, and the waitrress comes to sit down with you to explain the menu and the chilli ratings. She was fab - her english was excellent and she understood what food we wanted and heklped us pick some delicious food with the right level of spicy.I have seen some people complain that the portions are small, we found them perfect and a great example of quality over quantity! we happened to go on a quiet nightand the chef sat and chatted to us after dinner too. i wouldnt hesitate to recommend i
5
I liked a lot about the place. I like the staff, I liked the local of the place - very informal & above all else I loved the food. Perhaps the best Indian meal I have ever had. I must say I am no great fan of Indian food but this was good. If everybody else is saying lets go to an Indian place and your not 100% sure go here. The kitchen is spotless - they have an A - rating very few of these smaller places have that in Little India - I like the way the cooks from the kitchen bought you the food instead of waiters - that very Michelin. I think the place has a strong following - perhaps book & understand that this is not a fast food place so you do need to wait while they cook your food. If you only have 30 min its not the place for you
4
Very nice staff introducing you to the Indian cuisine and very good food, generally a good "insider tip" although TA turned it quite public of course. They could however work on the atmosphere, the walls are just plain white and everything looks a bit spartanic. Also portions are a too small, which comined had me rate it rather 4* than 5
4
We read about this place in tripadvisor and decided to give it a try. There is normal seating downstairs but it is much more atmospheric upstairs if you don't mind sitting cross legged on a cushion on the floor. The standout here is the service. The staff are all really genuinely helpful and friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we wanted, including explaining the spicyness index (#2 is probably enough for Western tastes!) for the curries. The food is fine but not outstanding bearing in mind it is situated in the heart of Little India where there is a fair bit of competition for this genre of food. However as a dining experience we would recommend going to Lagnaa
3
I had heard a lot about this restaurant so decided to try it out with friends. Yes, it provides a unique dining experience, but sitting on the floor really kills the atmosphere of sitting back and having a good time with friends. We all wanted to get out of there as soon as we were done eating to stretch our legs. The portions were also really small! I could eat one of those dishes as a snack. While I understand that we went at peak time, the place was understaffed, we were not properly attended to, and when we were, the waitress was flustered and told us to hurry up. And the food was average, nothing mind blowing. For that price, I probably wouldn't go again
4
We had a lovely family meal here with our children. The food was excellent and they even made us some onion bhajis, which aren't on the menu! The service was impeccable. Dishes a little on the small side for teenage boys, but nevertheless delicious. Oh and yes, you have to take your shoes off and eat barefoot.....nice touch!
5
The lady who owns this place is just lovely and friendly it's like eating in your mums house. Food is delicious and authentic.Barefoot dinning is comfortable and fun upstairs or you can sit downstairs amongst the cute notes written by customers & challengers. Not just an ordinary restaurant, they do cooking classes, tastings and the famous chilli challenge (you get your picture and a signed peg hung on the wall!).I'd recommend the butter chicken its divine in a rich red sauce perfect for dipping garlic naan! You also get popadons when you arrive but these are added on your bill on the end.I ate a lot of Indian food while staying in the Little India neighbourhood. This was by far by favourite. Great atmosphere. Definitely a satisfactory last meal in Singapore
5
I was walking around on my last day in Singapore. ( it turned out to be my second last day as myself and 14 others got bumped off our flight). Looking for something different to eat when i saw these painted footsteps and walked in to Lagnaa.When you walk in there is a sign that says take your shoes off, so I did and walked upstairs.i was astounded! they say absolute refinement seeks simplicity, and this place was so simply designed but it was perfect. the tables are all only a foot high and you dine sitting on a cushion on the floor. The lady in charge. Shanti, was great - the food was out of this world and i'll be going back with my wife in a few months time
4
I wasn't so sure of the barefoot thing but Singapore is so blessed warm it really wasn't a problem. Very good curries, moist rice, prompt and friendly service. Reasonabe prices for Singapore so altogether I'd recommend Lagnaa !
5
Had a quick meal at Lagnaa this week with a friend. we shares a biriani, some dahl and some breads and it was delicious, quick and well presented. The place has a great feel and the prices were good. What more could you want ?
2
Following Trip advisors reviews we decided to try this restaurant even though the favorite in the area is Khansama.I just don't get the reviews. The food is very average. Dishes are bland and that even includes the breads and condiments. I just doesn't seem authentic.Much better food in the area is available
5
We had dinner here on the last night of our honeymoon. We managed to get a table upstairs (barefoot area) even though we hadn't booked. Shanti was delightful - obviously loves being a hostess and genuinely interested in her guests. We tried the chicken sampler (at 1.5 spice level) before confirming our order for main course. We are regular eaters of Indian food and felt 2 was hot enough. It was just perfect for me - my husband said next time he'd like to try a little hotter (yes, while we were eating we were talking about the next time we would travel thousands of kilometres before having dinner here!). The fish tikka was superb - I usually don't like Indian fish dishes but this was succulent and delicious. We had the chicken sampler to start, two curries, two naan breads, rice and fish tikka and felt that was just about the perfect amount for us. By the time we'd finished the restaurant was very busy so we thought we'd go to the counter to pay. We were asked to wait a minute ... and out came a little surprise cake with a candle in it to wish us a happy honeymoon. What a lovely surprise. We started to eat but they asked us to wait a second - they were getting a camera ready. We didn't have a camera with us; so we were doubly delighted that they asked for an email address to send the photos to us. The next morning the photos were in my email inbox. We passed by the next day on our way to the airport loaded up with our backpacks and Shanti was out the front. We thanked her for the photos and she remembered not only who we were but even where we were from - wishing us a safe journey back to Australia. We were overwhelmed by the service, the food and the fantastic atmosphere - you can't feel too stressed sitting on a cushion with your shoes off. Thank you Lagnaa ... barefoot dining. It was a perfect way to finish off a wonderful trip

Visited the Lagnaa on the back of trip advisor reviews. Only small and situated off a side street in Little India we opted to sit in the downstairs part of the restaurant. Initially you look at the place and think cafe not restaurant however we received a warm welcome and the menu was explained to us. The Lagnaa has a chilli board depicting the strength of the curry you want. Firstly pick your meat/fish/veg then decide on what chilli strength you want....simple as that.We decided to have a chilli chicken starter between us and this was a 2 strength and was simply delicious.My wife then opted for a 3 strength and i bottled it and had a 2. Both dishes though were outstanding. Together with a very freshly cooked naan bread we had a great meal for a very reasonable price.The staff were all very attentive and helpful and overall I would definitely visit the Lagnaa again should I get to Singapore

I loved everything about this restaurant! It's on a side street in Little India, very easy to find. There are a few tables downstairs but upstairs is where you want to be - you sit on cushions on the floor and leave your shoes downstairs.Great, relaxing atmosphere and the staff were charming and hilarious. We ordered several different curries, garlic naan, basmati rice and plenty of cold beer. Everything was seriously delicious and very, very spicy! When there's a full moon you can order a spice level between 1 and 10. Every other night you order a spice level between 1 and 6. We asked for 1.5 - 2 for all of our dishes and it was SO hot!! i thought it was the perfect spice level - hot enough that you start to sweat a bit but not so hot you can no longer taste your food. No idea who can manage a 6!

We ate here August first 2012, and have to say that this is a fantastic spot both with regards to food and staff. Its located in Little India and is well worth the short trip for the city center. If you are looking for affordable indian cuisine with excellent staff - go here

A coworker and I ate an early dinner at Lagnaa on a recent trip to Singapore. We wanted to get a taste of Little India, and saw the good reviews on TA. Because it was early, we were seated downstairs (not in the barefoot section). The setting was a simple city cafe; nothing fancy, but very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and walked my coworker (who had never eaten Indian food) through the menu. He settled on some curry fish, and I had the butter chicken. We shared some basmatti rice and garlic naan. Everything came out together, and was all piping hot and freshly prepared. My coworker really enjoyed his fish, and my butter chicken was the best I've ever had. A quick word of warning. My coworker claims to love all things spicy, however on the advise of the waitress he only ordered his dish a "3" on the 1-10 spicy scale. He told me afterwords that any spicier and he would have been in trouble. Prices were very reasonable, and the service was fast and helpful. Singapore is a city full of great food, but for quick and easy Indian food, it would be hard to beat Lagnaa

This was the best meal we had in Singapore!!!!The food is amazing, the service fantastic.Sit upstairs and dine barefoot for the best atmosphere.If we are ever in Singapore again, this will be our first stop for dinner

Do you care enough for having an Amazing meal? Do you like your food? Do you love enjoying your meals? Do you like good service? Do you like feeling happy after having a good meal? If your answer is yes to all the above questions, please head to Lagnaa right away. They have different levels of spice - 1 to 10. I have gone upto 6. I survived. Food is mind numbingly brilliant. Their Biryani is a MUST TRY. They do not cook in batches. They cook per order. Imagine having Biryani cooked and customized as per your taste. Lovely! Their curries are different. They have a whole range of curries. Their Poriyal is lovely and so is their Yogurt Rice. Being a south indian, I have tasted various varieties of yogurt rice. But I have never had better curd rice in all my life. Service is brilliant. They are kind and they also celebrated my birthday in style! They gave me a surprise dessert with a nice little candle and a beautiful card.I want to keep going back there - again and again. I am sure after you go once, you will go back again and again!Three cheers to lagnaa for maintaining standard, having wonderful service, brilliant culinary skills and the tastiest food in Singa land

We had a great time sitting barefoot at this gem in Little India. The staff was very friendly, great service and great food. Watch out, food is MUCH spicier than you think!
5
Ok, this place is all about spices. And decent service, presentation and a great atmosphere.The staff is helpful, and they detail their spice levels very well to you. The place gives a very good vibe over all. One caveat though, the portions are rather small - but then again, they're so spicy that they have toMUST GO
5
The food here was delicious and I especially enjoyed the little touches that make this place special. Our waiter suggested we order a small starter of a 1.5 spice rating so as to gauge what spice rating would be best for each of us. He then customised our dishes to match our chosen spice level (the rating goes up to 10 and if I hadn't done the spice test I would have ordered a 4 – the test made it clear I wouldn't be able to handle anything higher than a 2!). We ordered a mixture of dishes and each tasted amazing. I definitely recommend
5
I don't know much about indian food and i was very pleased when the waiter explained it to me in great details. What were the differences between south indian and northern indian food, which food has what etc... It was more expensive than a regular indian restaurant -they didn't have set menus, but it was worth it. For the first time i found an indian food that suited perfectly with my taste thanksntonthe waiters suggestions. Wi fi was working perfectly
5
À must try if u like indian food!Very Nice people !100%satisfied!They advise you wisely what to eatNice atmosphere relaxingGreat taste Had chicken masala and with mushroomsU can leave à word on the walls of the place!loved it! <3Had Nice chat with owner Who advised what to check out un singapor

We stumbled across this restaurant by accident and Im happy we did. We took our shoes off and went upstairs for our barefoot dining experience. We were attended to, by lovely staff who explained Indian dishes to us and made recommendations, I loved that we could choose our spice levels. We enjoy spicy food and have eaten Indian food many times before, but were happy to have a bit of a lesson and soak up the atmosphere. Ok so maybe the staff were trying to sell us, more expensive dishes and maybe they were just being friendly so that we purchased more expensive dishes- but in the end we chose to dine there, and they are running a business. We were `chilled` and thoroughly enjoyed our evening dining experience -food beer tea- and each other's company (mother and daughter) sitting on cushions on the floor at small tables. Good fun and a memorable part of our holiday. Cant wait to take my husband next visit

An interesting little place in the heart of little India. The owner and staff are very pleasant and the menu although somewhat limited was ok, as to the best curry, sorry far from it. It lacked a great deal of authentic style and flavour I'm afraid. If you want a real curry you still try the original balti style dishes from brick lane in London. I did like the way they did the spice levels from 1 to 10 on the wall and I must say the basmatic rice being served in a little bamboo pot was also very different. Rice and nan bread both good
2
No matter how you slice it or dice it, this place is the quintessential tourist trap. The entire PR draw of the restaurant are the 10 increasingly spicy levels at which the food is prepared, other than that everything else is forgettable. Most customers are foreigners for a reason, the majority tourists (that most likely will never visit again) unaware of what good Indian food should taste like, not that it matters if you pick anything with a 'spicy' level above 4, cause your taste buds will be castrated regardless.To all those who wrote rave reviews.....did you even ask yourself why no Indian customers are to be seen?! That's because no sane Indian would eat there. Besides the ridiculous price for such small portions (hello...you are eating diced chicken, plain vegetables and white rice) food is bland and uninspiring....so much for the 'Master Chef' touted in the menus and literature. You get better tasting food at any food court around Singapore.It's not coincidental that all my Indian friends that tagged along with me on my first and second (and last) visit, adamantly said it will be their last time....I wonder why.Decor is as bare as it gets. My recommendation is to sit downstairs where at least you are sitting at a real table. Upstairs you have to remove your shoes (nothing wrong with that) and sit on the floor on small and uncomfortable mats. I guess that's an other ploy to move customers quickly......but wait.....if you happen to be there when it is busy, you will end up waiting at least half an hour to get an order of naan bread (which anywhere else in the world takes less than 5 minutes) and you'll find yourself sitting well over an hour to get your tiny portion. Don't dare to complain, as you will get to experience a good dose of passive aggressive (but polite) attitude from the serving staff/manager. Beers range from the usual selection of local and regional brands popular in India that normally sell for a handful of rupees, but here (nevermind we are in Singapore) are priced at least 5-8 times the amount. Essentially you are paying the same price (actually more) as at Brewerks in Clarke Quay, minus the ambiance, service and comfort.Yes, the managers are 'nice'...as in they will chat with you in a friendly manner and slyly con you to purchase the more expensive items on the list. Oh, water is free, but you are 'kindly' asked to go get it yourself in the Pantry-Restroom (great name combination).If you happen to be one of the brave folks that test their bowels in order to earn bragging rights on the 'clothes-pins wall of fame'...I have a couple words of advice. You should be aware that for this restaurant the term 'Spicy' is used (or abused) rather leisurely. I doubt that they use natural ingredients to jack up the Scoville heat units. Any dish above level 6 will contain a concoction of several spices aimed not at increasing just the heat level, but at rendering your stomach digestion as uncomfortable as possible. It's ironic that they use the word chili everywhere, but actually use very little of the natural thing. Do you really think they go out of their way to find sun dried Habaneros or Naga Bhut Jolokia?!One other tell tale is the manager's complete disregard for suggestions or constructive critique. He will systematically rebuff any mildly negative comment with an excuse or conveniently divert the conversation.In the end, if you want to have a bunch of laughs with your buddies while nuking your taste buds then this might be a good place.If you are looking to actually eat Indian food, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else a few blocks away

A few years ago I visited this restaurant aswell. Last month I was in Singapore and I had to eat here an other time, so I was very glad that I found Lagnaa again. If you love spicy food, this is the place to be. They offer 10 different levels of spicy-ness (from 1 to 3 for normal people and 4 and higher for dare devils). If you don't know what to choose their staff is friendly and very helpfull!Must try: banana lassi and chicken masal
5
We were initially a little miffed that we weren't allowed to order anything higher than spice level 6 - rules have it that you have to eat a level 6 dish before they'll serve you a 7 - seems a strange policy to not allow customers what they want - but our disappointment wasn't long lived when we ate our level 6 food and found it plenty spicy enough. We would like to have the chance to eat level 10, but in all honesty, it would be more a case of saying that you have climbed Everest - you would do it to prove something, but not for the pleasure!Anyway, spice levels aside, the flavours were very good and the quality excellent. The dishes and presentation is nice.Weren't so taken with the rice. We usually like pilau but here it is served with raisins and chopped vegetables, and lacked the yellow colour and strong aroma you normally associate with pilau.The manager, who we mistook for the owner, such was her passion and friendliness, was lovely and added to the experience
5
To keep it short and simple:
- Great food
- Great setting
- Great people
- Great service
Highly recommended
5
The price is expensive but worth the money. We ordered Indian (Nan) Pita Bread. They serve few versions - Garlic, Sweet and Plain. Garlic was great. Butter Chicken, Masala Fish were excellent.
4
Whilst exploring Little India came across the Lagnaa.
Great choices on the menu and a wall plaque indicating the chilli strength.
A daily special as well as the menu to choose from.
Highly recommended.

I have been traveling to Singapore ever year during Dec/Jan holidays for heh past 25 years. I was introduced to Lagnaa about 3 years ago. Since then, I have been frquently going there more than once every trip. Een when I meet up with friends, I use that place as a meeting point. First of all I like the concept of bare foot dining; somthing different. Then the friendly staff who greet me and also explain the chillie concept. I'm a suki lah lah when it beomes to eatinng hot and spicy curry. Much to the disgrace of my culture. The taste of the dishes is also different not the norm that one can get from other Indian cusines as I have eaten may iNidna cusines from a variety of restaurent in Singapore. As to the price, I have eaten in a more pricey restaurent with lesser delicious taste. So come on everyone who visits Singapore; Go to Lagnna.Thevi Chellia

This place is located in the buzz of Little India, walk too fast or if u dun pay too much attention, you would miss it - This place is a like a gem among the stones.I am a regular customer and I simply love the food here.My favorite dish - fish curry at level 3, upsize gravy :) I am a Chinese, I love drinking my curry :) and yoghurt rice goes hand in hand with this dish.This restaurant is like a family-run restaurant; homely, personal, and sincere.They do get busy at times, because the food is cooked ala carte - food is only prepared upon ordering, therefore, do bear with them when the food takes more than longer to arrive. They do their best to make sure the customers get their order as fast as they can already.Other items to try would be (at least my favorite), ice lemon tea, ice chocolate, cheese naan, tandoor prata, mutton masala (no mutton smell), dhaal and the mixed grills :)Hope you guys enjoy the food as much as I did...Lagnaa, a place where sincerity begins..
5
Finding good customer service in Singapore is like winning the lottery, but we definitely won with this one. As we were celebrating a birthday, the staff helped to make it special with a heart shaped naan bread and delicious chocolate! The butter chicken was AMAZING and the yogurt rice was fantastic. A great atmosphere plus amazing food sealed the deal for us. We can't wait to go back
5
Went to lagnaa after a recommendation. V good Indian food in a relaxed setting(2 to choose from). Ground floor is an open concept while e 2nd is barefoot n sitting on e floor w cushions.Great ambience n v friendly staff. A must for all Indian Food connoisseu

Despite the high prices we were charmed into eating here by the friendly staff. We were served chips and dip to start, and convinced to try the chicken chilli dish (in hindsight rushed into the decision). We also ordered the garlic naan and Tandoori chicken. The chilli chicken arrived and the portion was shockingly small, but after all it was only an $9.50 appetizer. From then on things got worse and the portions got even smaller. The boneless Tandoori chicken had bones in it ($15 I wish I had back). The garlic naan was ok at best. We asked for the bill and were presented with an extra $1.50 charge for the "complimentary" chips. We did not even order them! I complained and the woman said "well you ate them, and most other places nearby charge for napkins" We will not return nor recommend this tourist trap. Look elsewhere

If it wasn't for Trip Advisor I would never have found this place. Print a map!! If you were to walk by it, you'd not know it was there. I couldn't make out a sign or anything. But you can tell it's there by the # of people eating there. It's a popular place with good reason.I booked three tables upstairs (A/C) for myself and 12 co workers. We got three set menus and the food was fantastic. I love spicy food and appartently this place does not dissapoint. Like I said I was on a set menu, so of course I couldn't order food as spicy as I'd like, but the set menu came as a 1.5 on a scale of 10 and I could tell that food would have a good kick as you went to 3. I'm used to ordering 10 and being dissapointed, this place would kill you at 10. :)The owner and chef greeted my group and were extremely friendly and gracious. They even served us some free chili specialties to test or spice abilites. It doesn't feel like a restaurant, it feel like a friends house, which makes things that much nicer
4
We went to this restaurant at the recommendation of a friend of a friend, and we were not disappointed. Casual barefoot dining without chairs. Good Indian food served by personable staff, who stayed to chat about Singaporean cuisine. The restaurant is easily overlooked so keep an eye out for the ingenious signs they have along the road. A fun place to go with fun people
2
If they just bought and reheated marks and spencer's indian takeaway they would have authentic shop AND decent curries.
Good choice of naans thoug everything is bit on the pricey side for a streetcorner shop.
Why is this #24 in Singapore???
4
The 1-10 spice/heat choices are a bit of a gimmick, but it is fun idea.
All the food we had (nothing hotter than a four) was delicious, the tandoori cooked paratha and the yoghurt rice were particularly good.
1
Lagnaa was mentioned in Tripadvisor to be the one of the better restaurants in Singapore. However, for me it was the worst indian restaurant I have been in my life. Atmosphere was more like a dirty place on the street and food was for me terrible. I selected the Masalla with chickenpeas and it did not taste at all (with a heavy butter sauce). Also the price was rather high than low. I really cannot recommend this place. I also did not feel well afterwards
2
Because we love Indian food and after reading the positive reviews on Trip advisor we decided to give this place a try, we were exploring little India and went and had a look and were greeted by a very friendly waitress and a satisfied customer. We booked a table for the evening and were really looking forward to the experience.We arrived and knew were would be sitting on the floor but the cushions were not overly comfortable and we thought this was just a gimmick that was not really needed.The beers were quite expensive (although this is the same in lots of places in Singapore)We ordered our food to share 1 vegetable curry and 1 chicken special dish, they were served on plastic plates which would have been OK but not in somewhere that was charging a premium. The portions were also very small compared with other Indian restaurants.The dishes tasted OK but unfortunately the chicken was raw and pink in the middle! When I complained, the dish was taken away and 5 minutes later the same waitress asked if we were waiting for anything, when we said our chicken she seemed surprised but a little while later a replacement arrived, by this time all our other food had gone cold and we had lost our appetite.We decided to cut our losses and go and another lady asked if we had enjoyed our meal and we told her no and she insisted we sit down and she would make it up to us. She returned with 1 frozen Ice cream dessert to share and also did not charge us for our chicken dish.We would say that this place was not great for us and is overrated, and when we looked at the clients in the restaurant it was full of Tourists with not one Indian customer. In hindsight we would say look how many Indians are eating in the other restaurants and then choose carefully
4
We really enjoyed our meal at Lagnaa and loved the interesting decor and the idea behind the 'chili challenge'. I am pretty weak when it comes to hot food and found even the lowest level of heat a bit spicy, but most people wouldn't have that problem! The staff were great and we left happy and full.
4
The indian food here is very good. The owner and the chef (K7) were extremely helpful with the menu, and were fun to chat with. They obviously enjoy running their business and making customers happy. A great choice when looking for good indian food in Singapore
5
Great Indian food, from shrimp, to mutton, to chicken, vegetarian, etc. this restaurant knows the meaning of spiciness. You can chose from 1 to 10, and if you finish your dish you make it to the wall of fame. My advise: think twice before getting spiciness 3 or above. The staff is amazing, they are sweet and friendly, and make you feel at home and part the family. I recommend you try the lime lassie, as I had never found it before and it is very good.
5
If I am to describe this place in one word, it is CHARACTER... This restaurant is oozing with such!Tucked away from the chaos of Little India, Lagnaa has been in existence for 6 years already (according to the owner) - despite being a resident of Singapore for more than 3 years, I did know about this restaurant until only last week courtesy of an Italian colleague (who ironically has only lived here since late last year).The food is great; for most of the dish, they will ask you on your spice level. I believe this goes from 1.5 to 6 - so far, I can only manage 2!! Order the chicken masala @ 2 and arm yourself with lotsa rice and a mango lassi to fight the spicyness.Ambiance wise, I love it... This is a very good place to just chill out after a very very bad week at work. The second level of the restaurant, they do not allow you to bring in your footware hence you will be eating barefoot and sitting on the floor.Will I come back? Definitely, I will be bringing more of my kinds there..
5
We ate upstairs and took off our shoes and sat down on some cushions on the floor. The staff is very friendly, upbeat, friendly and accommodating. We started our experience with a yummy alcoholic grape drink (which I had another). We choose level 2 for our spice level but could have done hotter. We had the the three types of lentil dish, eggplant dish and a shrimp dish with saffron rice. All the food was absolutely wonderful. For dessert we had warm spongecake with baileys. A wonderful experience
5
If Indian food is what your looking for you cannot go wrong with Lagnaa.They offer you great service, freshly made Indian cuisine, and if you can go for a strength four and above you get your own peck to leave as a memory.Certainly one of the best Indian meals we have enjoyed with great service we will return
5
The staff are really friendly here, and you order your curry according to how spicy you want it. There is also a good range of dishes here. I've been back several times and have always loved the food.
3
$7 for a 2nd rate Peshwari Naan. Nice food but too focused on trade and margin rather than value and customer satisfaction. $98 for a mixed starter platter and a bottle of wine!! Ouch!!!
5
After wandering around Singapore's Little India one evening recently we stumbled across Lagnaa's graffiti covered entrance and walls. Offered a seat outside by their very friendly staff, as both upstairs and downstairs was full, we enjoyed one of the best Indian meals we have had for some time. The steamed rice was served in a small bamboo pot, which kept it warm, and the garlic naan was flavorful, without being overpowering. The tender lamb was cooked in a tomato and green pepper curry, prepared at two on the heat scale, which my wife toned down a little with what would have been one of the best yogurt raita's I have tried. The accompanying dahl curry was also very nice, with it all washed down with an icy cold Kingfisher beer. When I asked K7 (the Chef) why their Raita was so different from what I had tasted before he gave me a very detailed explanation as to why, but unfortunately stopped short of giving me the recipe! We had a very pleasant night, and by Singapore prices we felt it was reasonably priced. Sure, you could find cheaper in Little India, but I don't believe you would get the same quality of food, service or atmosphere as Lagnaa and it's staff offer. Highly recommended

The restuarant, although appealing by its website, is not as great as I had anticipated. I guess you are not supposed to always expect the best simply because the website is appealing. From the street level, the restaurant looks like any place in Little India. There are two dining options (upstairs where you must take off your shoes and sit on a pillow short table or typical table and chairs on the ground floor). Although I chose the downstairs seating option, there were quite a few diners going upstairs throughout the evening. First and foremost, the staff are very friendly. I was greeted warmly by three different people. As this place is very small, the number of people greeting diners is significantly large. The decor upstairs is very nice while downstairs is very basic with little to no decoration other than the chili scale. Yes folks, there is a scale for you to select your "heat level" of the entree you choose. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 and anything equal to or greater than a 3 will get you a clothespin to document your heat level experience and place on a wire extending from the respective heat level you chose. There were a lot of 3s and 4s, but as the scale got warmer very few seemed to venture into this area of tongue torture. I chose two dishes with various heat levels to take part in the Lagnaa ritual as well as to try different dishes. For both, the sauce was fantastic. However, the paneer was cut to chunks smaller than peas and the chicken I had could only be described as chicken fat. Although the gravy/sauce was fantastic, I was left with below average quality for the primary ingredient thus rating this restaurant as "Average." If you like Chipati, order one at a time and let them be fresh and warm as you need them.The price is above average for Little India, but definitely lower than the restaurant prices you find throughout the rest of Singapore when dining at a restaurant or a non-Hawker center. I paid approximately $8 for each dish and $7 for each beer. In total, I spent less than $40 for two entrees, two beers, and two chipati. The restaurant does take credit card, so no need to carry cash.If you are wondering about the amount to order, I think that most people will opt to select two entrees as the portions are small. However, I recommend that you order them separately so that you can consider increasing your spice level and take the Lagnaa challenge! Even if the food is average, the experience may leave you with some lasting memories. According to the lady that works there, only one person has claimed the right to eating a Level 9 with no one meeting the Level 10 challenge with success. If you like competition in these things, give it a try
5
Fully deserving a 5, we were welcomed b y the staff who explained the menu and the spice scale, have a starter at 1.5 and see how you react! We had a 2 for the main course which was pleasently tingly! Everything was spot on, if you are fussy about meat then lamb was less fatty than the chicken but that is a small observation, visit, enjoy, tell others! but not too man
5
Take that statement with a grain of salt, since I've never travelled to India. But Toronto is a very cosmopolitan city with a large Indian population, so I've had my fair share of Indian food - but nothing that comes close to the flavours experienced at Lagnaa.The place is located in Little India, and while it seems popular with the backpacker/expat crowd, the food is very authentic from what I could tell. The restaurant offers a "standard" dining room at the ground level, as well as barefoot dining upstairs, where customers sit on cushions on the ground. Takes a bit of getting used to, but still comfortable.The manager was very friendly, and great at recommending/describing different dishes, spice levels etc. My personal favorite was the mutton masala (have it spicy!). This restaurant is considerably pricier than most of the nearby Indian fast food joints, but still reasonably priced by North American standards. Portions seemed small at first, but 6 dishes + naan was a good amount for 4 people. We went back the next day and our meal was just as good (even though we upped the spiciness a little past my comfort zone)
5
An excellent dining experience sitting in a cushion in an immaculate floor (they have chairs in the first floor, but we were very comfortable).Food was a little expensive, but IMHO worth every penny.Spice level (in my case 6) was REALLY hot (the way I like it).My son is still trying to guess what was in the fruit punch, he absolutely loved it!The service was excellent, overall a winner.Will definitely return if I visit Singapore again
3
The quality of the food (Indian cuisine) is very good. The prices on the other hand are far from being average. The restaurant has tables and chairs downstairs and floor seaing upstairs which is not all that confortable. Furthermore, the restaurant is located in Little India where you will find excellent Indian food at much better prices. Summa summarum: not worth the money
5
Lagnaa is a special place were you eat very carefully selected Indian specialties, test your tolerance to different chili levels and have a super time with your friends and everybody around! K7, the master chef and the staff will take the time to walk you through the menu, the monthly special and much more. I highly recommend the Thread Fin fish curry, the basil fish, and many other dishes. To enhance this experience, you can also take cooking classes, which I'm planning to do sooner rather than later. It's a must to try the food and to enjoy the atmosphere in Little India (a few minutes away from the MRT). Enjoy it
5
Went to Lagnaa a couple of days ago and had the best time! The lady who runs the place is an absolute gem! Perfect mix of efficiency, humour and general loveliness!! The food was incredibly fresh tasty and simple. Being Dewali it was really busy in little India so the atmosphere was great. Can't recommend the place enough. Oh and as Singapore goes it was great value for money!
2
Extremely disappointing food and service and overpriced for Little India. The owners fawn over tourists and give locals short shrift when it comes to service.
5
Best Indian food I have had in Singapore and by far the best value. If you dont know what to eat ask the staff friendly, informative. The resteraunt is a work of love for the job.
5
A wonderful evening with great tasting food and superb service. Would recommend this resturant for those looking for good Indian food.
5
Stumbled upon the place, coincidentally as we were preparing for an Indian dinner at home with some friends. Sat down for a great disccussion with Kaesavan and left with a lamb dish rated at level 4. Delicious in the way spicy should be. Definitely climbing the scale on the next visit
3
On my last visit to Singapore I wanted to go to this Indian restaurant. Location was not as easy to find. Lot of crowd but average downtown restaurant. For that matter it is not bad. The service and the staff were good but the food was very hot for any average hot food. I am from Bangladesh and quite familiar with spice and hot food. The spices and the chili really camouflage the real quality of food. I could not like the food as much as many other seemed to have liked
2
I'm British and live in Singapore so have been brought up on Indian food and regularly eat around Little India. I like curries very much so when offered a choice of spicy/hot between 1-6, like most people, I selected 3 but was advised by the waitress I would be better off choosing 2...I could barely eat the meal as it was so spicy/hot it actually hurt to eat.The portions were very small indeed and come with nothing. Rice needs to be ordered and I was waiting for a charge for a plate. They charge you for the poppadoms they place on the table when you sit down without mentioning that.In short very expensive and not great value for money.Lastly, and possibly worrying for me, I have never had an allergy to anything in my life but came out in a horrible rash later in the evening so for me I wouldn't return as something definitely wasn't right..
4
The food is very good and fresh, the service is exceptional friendly. The shop is small but good enough for a small family like us. There is an interesting level of chilly spiciness that one can choose. The price of the food is a bit on a higher end
5
Very friendly hostess gave us a sample dish to try, to get the spice level of our order. Good technique to avoid disappointment either way. Food was brought out in a timely fashion and was extremely flavoursome. Our party of seven enjoyed our meal immensely, and it was a great introduction to Singaporean dining on my first visit. I'll be back
4
Lagna was better than i expected. initial response when i first heard of it was of a tourist trap but its not. its a nice cozy restaurant with a great cook calls himself the Big Toe (?) ,runs the place with his wife who's an amazing host.The spice levels are graded so that you can select the level of spice ( or the amount of chilly ) you want in your food.must try "gulab jamun in baileys" as desert.loved it
3
Service = very nice - super friendly, cheerful, and helpful advice on level of spice. Food is made to order and comes out in 10 mins or so.Ambiance = so, so. It is upstairs in an oldstyle 2-story building. Limited windows. You eat sitting on the floor. Room could use some decorations.Price = expensive for Little India. Mains were $8, which is fine, but Lassi's were $6 and you must by rice and naan separately. Plain rice and naan were reasonable, but flavored in anyway were around $5. Bear in mind you can eat a whole meal in Little India for $6 pretty easily. Beer was very expensive - I think around $12 a bottle.Portion size: dissapointingly small. The masala (Kashmiri Dum Aloo in my case) was served in a bowl about the size of a coke can cut in half. There were only two Dum Aloo balls. There wasn't enough masala to mix with a full portion of rice. I didn't leave full - very rare for Indian food.Food quality: pretty good. Naan was moist and not burnt. Kashmiri Dum Aloo was the right consistency but a bit bland - lacked the richness/robustness you would get in the US/UK.They seem to have a dedicated following as indicated by other reviews here and also that they throw themed parties and have a wall of fame for people that eat the spiciest food. The niceness of the service makes you want to like the place and come back.I'd give it another chance if I was with someone scared to eat at one of the more earthy, cheaper shops that are all over the place in that area, but I thought it was just ok, not as great as its rating on Trip Advisor suggests

We ate at Lagnaa for the first time last night. I only wish we had discovered it 2 years ago when we came to live in Singapore. The food and the atmosphere were absolutely perfect.

My boyfriend and I went to Lagnaa a couple of weeks ago while in Singapore. The food was great and the staff were wonderful as well.We chose this restaurant because of the great reviews on Trip Advisor. We agree with all of the positive comments we read. It's a simple restaurant with great food. There are a couple of 'regular' tables on the ground floor which you can sit at or you can go upstairs and eat barefooted. We sat upstairs an loved it. The food was proper Indian food and you can ask for various levels of spiciness.Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone and would definitely return

I took my family here based on the prominence of this restaurant among those reviewed in Singapore (#3 among "Romantic" restaurants; #6 overall). The downstairs (street level) seating is open-air; upstairs is air conditioned (thank Goddess!). "Barefoot dining" strikes me as a superfluous ("So what?") concept among Indian restaurants, and those featuring Asian cuisine more generally. Go to any Indian (East or West) household, and you'll find the same practice a commonplace. Is this supposed to appeal to Western tourists for whom dining unshod is a novelty?The food is adequate unexceptional. Indeed, I've had tastier Indian dishes at local food courts and hawker centers. Much is made of the "Full Moon Day Chili Challenge," but food seasoned to such a severe degree is purely a tough-guy (or -gal), "I survived _____" novelty, and has no attraction to genuine connoisseurs of Indian (or any other) cuisine.I have three specific complaints:1. Slow service. Although our party was only the second one seated in the upstairs, our entrees were delivered 45 minutes after we placed our order.2. Cook refused to prepare menu items. Our server returned after we place our four-entree order to inform us that "Cook says he can't make Shrimp Biryani; he's too busy." Bear in mind that we were only the second table seated. We were 'allowed' to order a shrimp dish, and a separate saffron rice dish--but the cook was too overwhelmed to accommodate our initial order.3. Poor value. Probably my biggest gripe is the portion size (about 6 oz.) to cost ($10-15) ratio at Lagnaa. It is simply dishonest to respond to this criticism by suggesting that portion size is kept small in order to afford patrons the opportunity to sample more varied flavors. Pathetic! The only one who benefits from such an arrangement (which the first-time customer is in no position to imagine) is the owner of the restaurant. Would they be satisfied if I offered to pay my bill suing Monopoly money (in lieu of Singapore currency), arguing for its varied color scheme? Of course not. As it was, I paid pennies shy of $100 for a small dinner for two adults and two little ones (aged 5 & 3). Ouch!I'd be delighted to learn of some changes in restaurant policy and practice. The place has the makings of a fine Indian restaurant, and could be redeemed with some judicious changes in approach

Visited for the first time last week. Lovely staff and atmosphere. However, a few things...the wait for our meal was nearly 40 minutes. And we couldn't order what we really wanted off of the menu, because the chef was too busy. But after reading what many other reviewers have written -- and the restaurant staff response...I must stress one point above others: portions are too small for what they charge. Not a good value in comparison to many other restaurants in the area. In response to other reviewers who have also commented on this, the restaurant staff say that it's so that customers can sample a variety of flavours. That is a ridiculous line of thinking. For example, we ordered a dish and when it came out we thought it was a complimentary dip -- it was so small! If the prices were brought down even slightly to reflect the portion size I would be a repeat customer. If the restaurant is truly interested in having customers enjoy and sample what the chef has to offer then, again, bring the price down. As it is, I have to agree with other reviewers that there are so many other options in Little India that will leave you feeling more satisfied -- instead of paying for a gimmick, as another reviewer remarked. Taking off your shoes is not unique/limited to this restaurant. Go to another restaurant and pay less to take off your shoes

This is my go-to restaurant for whenever I play host to new visitors to Singapore and thus far everyone has had nothing but good things to say about it. And why wouldn't they? It's a lovely place for a convivial gathering; it has a cozy second floor where you remove your shoes and sit around a table which makes it feel a bit like having a meal at a friend's home.Very conducive for long, relaxed conversation. The staff are friendly and extremely accommodating - they offer vegetarian options that aren't on the menu, just ask! Most importantly, the food is delicious (and reasonably priced!), complex and full of flavour as is typical of Indian cuisine. My personal favourites are the chicken masala (anything followed by 'masala' is great), aubergine, aloo gobi paired with yoghurt rice. It is nestled in Little India, one of the more interesting parts of Singapore, so it really is worth visiting
3
Our experience was not consistent with other recent reviews. The concept is gimmicky and not very comfortable.The choice of heat in the meal had no precision, we could not distingish between 2.5 or 3.5, they really just have mild, meium or hot.The meals were OK but we had meals of the same quality for a cheaper price elsewhere.The service and friendliness of the staff was the strongest feature
5
One rarely goes wrong in Little India in Singapore - but Lagnaa Barefoot deserves a special mention! The food is innovative but yet hits home for those in search of good Indian comfort food. When I went there early in August 2011, there was a fun promotion where a free appetizer is given in exchange for a few lines from Singapore's national anthem. Overall a great dining experience
5
i have been to Lagnaa 3 times. We are treated like old friends. the food is amazing, you get to choose how hot you would like your dish.That, coupled with the fantastic service is enough to keep me going back again and again.If you only eat in one Indian restaurant in Singapore, I highly recommend Lagnaa
2
The concept is great, sitting on cushions shoes off makes for a more entertaing experience. Add that to the ability to choose the level of spice for your food and this should be great. Unfortunately the actual food was a big let down, It was all relatively bland (irrespective of heat level) and really nothing special at all. Given that this costs circa $30 a head, which is quite expensive for Little India, it was big let down. There are many far better restaurants in the area for far less cash, please visit these instead

We went there with a friend as I was tempted buy all positive comments I saw online. I also recognize that I love indian cuisine but not especially the atmosphere (not cosy and not really clean) of some eateries around Lagnaa.Therefore the value of Lagnaa is that it is clean and cosy.But regardless how long you have been living in Singapore you will feel like a tourist there. Staff is friendly but a bit pushy in suggesting additional items to order. In all places around they would serve you ice water without even asking. Here they come with bottled water you have to pay. These little things even if you are welcomed in a warmly manner make you feel like a fool tourist. Food wise the taste is average but good point is that it looks fresh

Great food, great service and a great price. Great place to eat in Little India

Went here tonight for the first time (24may11)Almost walked past the place, but we took a look at the menu and decided to give it a try. The hostess ( and waitress since it was a Tuesday was very welcoming and fun. We went upstairs to the barefoot area and sat on cushions- fabulous ambience. I started with the masala margarita, which was recommended by other people- not exactly my taste- more like a tequila eggnog - but maybe worth a try if you are looking for something different. We had 2 mutton dishes, 2chicken and 1 veg. grading for spice is a 1-6 scale- if you like spice, a 3 or 4 will cut it! Overall, good quality & excellent taste- will go back
5
When we travel, we expect meals to be 'hit and miss''; some good, some okay, some woeful. We end up being grateful if we are served something edible and relieved if the staff are reasonable! So, when the cuisine is divine, the staff friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere relaxing, we pause, we savour every mouthful, we enjoy the total experience. Such is Lagnaa. Fresh ingredients imaginatively prepared by talented chefs who even give you a test run to find out your spice tolerance. What a great idea! We enjoyed our dinner so much (the food, the Indian spice tea, the thought-provoking notices on the walls), we returned for lunch the next day. We love Singapore and always stay in Little India. Next time, we know where we'll be dining. Do yourselves a favour and check out Lagnaa too. It really is an exceptional place. You can sit on cushions upstairs for a different experience or, like us, at tables downstairs

I have been coming here for two years, it's the best place for indian food (well any food) that I know of...(a couple of my friends argue that mustard is better - I disagree!) But anyway, great food for any palette, if you like delicate carefully balanced flavours then you can't go wrong, equally if like me you often crave crazy spicy, but still like the curry to taste good under all that heat then go for the level 6 murgh curry leaf...delicious. also try to get in for one of the tasting evenings, or treat yourself to a cooking class

I’m sorry to say but this makes a mockery of Trip Advisor’s tag line “Reviews you can trust”. On a day trip to Singapore in early March 2011, with time to spare and unfamiliar with the city, I decided to see where Trip Advisor’s members recommended eating. Lagnaa was right at the top (still today it is shown as 3rd out of 1,614 restaurants in all Singapore!) and since I love Indian food I decided to go and find it. I wasn’t expecting much of the joint (Mackke described it as “rather low end”) – and it is pretty basic, but that didn’t excuse the uncleaned table top. I sat downstairs as it was empty (late afternoon so no surprise) – there’s no AC here, maybe that’s upstairs, and not much to look at except the tiled wall covered in customers’ graffiti and the kitchen. However, I was expecting great things of the food after all the positive reviews on this site – and in that I was very disappointed. The chicken dish I had (sorry forgotten the name) was sweet rather than spicy while the daal was absolutely tasteless. It was only 6pm when I left and Lagnaa was still empty. Walking back through Little India the restaurants on Serangoon Road were bustling with customers. You would surely be better picking one of these at random if you visit the area

For some reason this restaurant has a great reputation by tourists and expats. Have now been taken there twice. Yes you pop off your shoes and sit on the floor. And you can choose how spicy you want your food on a scale of 1 to 10. But for the money, you get small portions that are less shiok (the Singapore word for "delicious") than any number of Indian restaurants in Little India or elsewhere in Singapore. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with the place. But in a city of delicious food of all sorts of different cuisines and price levels, it's not worth seeking out

I was very excited to go there after I reading all the fantastic reviews on trip advisor. However, I was very disappointed. I am an indian food fanatic, and me and my partner (who is less fanatic than me) did not think that was real indian food. No spices, no flavors, portions were very small and naan breads were not very nice as well. For a starter we had a mint and yogurt dip which was fantastic and we thought we were in for a fantastic meal. Then the mains arrived and leaving us disappointed. The staff was very nice and friendly, organized and fast. If you are very picky with indian food I wouldn't recommend it. Singapore is packed of place to eat

After numerous trips to Banana Leaf, we thought we'd give somewhere else a whirl in Little India. We love a good curry and were not disappointed with Lagnaa. We all loved the idea of choosing how spicy you wanted your dish (on a spice scale from 1 - 10) as this suited those of us that prefer a less spicy dish as well as those who like the chilli kick.Really recommend this place, lovely atmosphere, great food and a nice change to the canteen style curries served up elsewhere in Little India.Favourite dishes were Butter Chicken and Lamb Bhuna
5
What a great place!Meals are authentic Indian, full of flavour. They're not too large, so at S$8 to 10, you can order one or two per person and really try out a few different varieties. Asking the staff what they suggest is a good idea, we would have skipped dessert if not for their suggestions, and they were great. Don't miss out on a post-meal tea, or the fennel breath-freshener upon paying at the register

Went here after recommendations from Trip Advisor. It was simply not what I expected.
Rather low end establishment, with very slow service and limited choice of drinks (no lassies available).
Food was decent, but nothing special. Get much better indian food in London.
4
more or less all the indian restaurants around south east asia have exactly the same menu, same taste, same setting. They are actually quite tedious. Well this one is a little better in any point or view.
5
This is the second time I've visited Lagnaa & put quite simply, the food, the quirky ambience, the chef & the staff are all exceptional. It would be easy to miss this little gem, hidden away in Little India but if you make the effort to seek it out, you will not be disappointed. It is fun, fabulous & friendly - a great place for you to kick off your shoes, relax & enjoy a delicious meal
5
We read the reviews on trip adviser and decided to book a table. We were not disappointed, the food was fantastic, the staff were absolutely lovely and we had a night to remember.If you like Indian food this is the place to go as is doesn't get any bette

Being English, we love a good curry and often visit Little India to satisfy our cravings.We have tried a number of the restaurants now, initially on guide book recommendations, but we stumbled across Lagnaa on a quiet street by accident and have kept returning since.The food is excellent quality but the real win is the friendly service and welcome.My partner has also been to a cookery class run by the team which he really enjoyed.You can try the barefoot dining upstairs but we tend to opt for a seat on the street so we can enjoy the evening atmosphere in Little India

This fantastic restaurant is easily missed alongside it's neighbouring shops and busy roads. Not neccessarily a bad thing for guests like us who seeked it out based on the reviews. We were treated to lovely food in an unbeatable atmosphere - busy enough to have a nice ambience without being packed in. We dined on a weekend and hadn't booked. The concept (barefoot dining) is brilliant and sitting on cushions on the floor eating felt very natural and was enjoyable. Service was great - you're taken through the menu options, get to choose spice level (I recommend level 3) and the staff join you on their knees to speak to you and deliver the food rather than tower above. Food was delicious. Highly recommended

We arrived to a warm welcome from the lovely owner and went upstairs (removing our shoes) to a peaceful air conditioned room with about 8 low tables and cushions.The food is graded for heat from 1 to 10 and we had the delicious chilli chicken (a 1.5) to start which led us to limit the heat of our next courses to 2 and no higher!This was diligently followed and the main courses of chicken and lamb were absolutely divine.The meal was rounded up with a chocolate fondue and we had a couple of cold beers each. The total bill was just under Â£50 - a complete bargain and the best indian meal we have EVER had.So drop buy on Little India and if you want a good liquor store find Irene at the rambly store she runs in the same area. Wow quite a scramble and a bit like looking through a second hand store - only alcohol not clothes are what are haphazardly there to find. And some gems to boot with some vintage XO brandy at a knock down price and wines over a decade old at less money than duty free in the airport.Little India is full of fun and we loved the whole experience which was the highlight of SIngapore

Have been here a few times since moving to Singapore. Love the chilli challenge concept of eating at different spice levels (for 7 and above you have to wait for a full moon). Food is fresh and tasty and they have a good selection of Indian beers. Fun and friendly service. Enjoy

Although this restaurant is a little more expensive than most in Little India, you get what you pay for, and in this case you are paying for great food in a comfortable and extremely friendly setting. No one is going to hover over your table or try to move you on, so you can relax with friends and have a good night.It's probably best to ask what's good for the night, because the daily specials are excellent. If you order curries you'll need to specify a chili-rating and unless you're fire-proof you won't want to go over a 4.Lagnaa is an excellent example of a backpacker/tourist restaurant that's done well and also attracts locals. Little India can be a bit daunting for visitors, and Lagnaa takes away all those cultural worries. Everyone is extremely friendly, English is perfect, and they are perfect hosts who know how to make you comfortable and guide you around the menu.Downstairs is chatty and open to the street. If you're traveling alone then this is a great choice and you won't feel lonely here. Upstairs the decor is simple and if you like to sit on the floor at home then you'll love relaxing here with a flow of beer and small dishes.There's a great range of breads (naan), including a sunflower version and a sesame version, but I think plain naan is sometimes best.I've been here a couple of times and haven't had a bad dish. They often have regional dishes on the menu that are more interesting than the standard fare on Racecourse Road. They know what they're doing in the kitchen and some dishes (especially the ones from the specials menu) have been very memorable. My favourites from a recent visit was the vegetarian prawns and a delicious dark dhal

www.lagnaa.comNo only north Indian food is available. If somebody don t like to spicy food you are able to select your spice level before ordering. relaxing atmosphere in the restaurant. you also could sit outside > recommended for smoker. I prefere to order some sesame nan and butter marsala.between five beers you could decide or you just order all. However, I did spice level 6, if somebody could go higher than 7 I guess they cheat. btw 10 is maximu
