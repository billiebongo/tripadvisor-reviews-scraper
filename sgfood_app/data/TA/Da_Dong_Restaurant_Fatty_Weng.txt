Very crowded on a Sunday afternoon. The food was so salty. Overheard another table also complained about the food being too salty. Service was average.

Everything you would want from this type of restaurant is here. Service was quick and easy,great range of beers on offer and the food was excellent!!!
4
Stopped in here for main course after starters in the street. I opted for liver because I thought it was traditional and not some thing you will find everywhere. It was great!! Food, service and price was really good. Give it a try.
3
Great food in a hectic shopping area. Old school abounds. So many locals eating here you knew it had to be good. Pretty cheap too!
5
Clean, airconditioned, friendly staff and most important very good food!! Maybe a little more expensive than in the Foodstreet but therefore you eat inside with tableclothes and napkins. I have added a short movie on how the duck is served (says more than words)

I've been coming to Fattys for 30 + years and met the original Mr FattyHowever it has progeny nowDon't go there if you expect Anglicised food - Chinese totally authenticThe lived with ginger fantasticBrilliant value: food and copious amounts of beer Â£200 for 8Can't knock it Not the best part of Singapore in middle of Mkt but safe yet boistrou

We drank a few beers here and watched people eat over a couple of days before deciding to eat here. The service is "efficient" getting close being rushed. However, the food is really nice and it comes out quickly. We had a half Peking Duck which was initially served as skin only with a sauce, cucumber and small pancakes. After that, the meat was presented stir fried with finger and vegetables. Excellent. Yes it was reasonably expensive for Chinatown but we enjoyed it.
4
Seems to have gone through a rebrand, but the place is the same. Go there for the duck. $35 for half a duck is great value. And they serve the duck with rice pancakes, instead of the normal wheat ones. They're great and a little different. Second course, go simple with Spring Onion. They bone the duck too, which isn't always the case and makes for an easier, less messy, second round. Not the best duck in Singapore, but great value.
4
Chinatown is bonkers and the choice is daunting! So, with so much choice you have to choose somewhere. I picked this place for its location at a busy pedestrian intersection. The food was ok. The service was very good. The best aspect is being able to people watch whilst eating. The menu isn't extensive which is quite appealing and the prawns tasted delicious. So, with so much choice this was a perfect place to stop and refuel. Is it the best? Probably not but you have to choose somewhere.
5
I took a photo of the empty plates as we sat discussing the fabulous meal we had just had at Fatty Weng's. The restaurant is on a corner in the busiest part of Chinatown so you can watch the busy world go by as you enjoy your meal and drinks. The staff are courteous and quick to refill glasses and dishes if required. We had returned again for another great dining experience at Fatty Weng's

Went here with my family for brunch on a hectic day in Chinatown. We had the crispy duck, which was alright. The service was good and the location with outdoor tables was also good. Nothing spectacular, but ok.
4
Dined here twice during our singapore holiday and were very surprised by the excellent service and food. The staff went out of there way to recommend dishes and we were not disappointed by their suggestions. thank you....

Great tasting local food, good value. Comfortable to eat inside as Esther noisy outside, well worth a visit.

We were a group of 5 friends had read good reviews so decided to try. We were disappointed not at the food it was very nice not over the top but we were happy enough the service was a little slow to none & the waitress was abrupt. The restaurant was not full there was only us & another 2 couples BUT what got us was You're brought peanuts and a paper napkin which is charged for on your bill! We were left waiting when we asked for a 2nd round of drinks & one of our party asked for a glass of water no ice when it came out it was warm & brown looking and we were charged 30 cents. Would not recommend going ther

We went there for late dinner on a weekday. As a Cantonese the food there was close to my taste hud. We order sambal Kang Kong, veg with tou fu. Roasted duck with plum sauce, roasted chicken and slice fish with ginger and spring onion.I really love the roasted duck with plum sauce. The duck skin was crispy and the taste of the sauce was just right for my taste. As for tou fu they are generous with the thick gravy which serve as a good complement for the ric

We went with trip advisors average reviews and can see why it's average! Pushy waitresses pointing out expensive items with loud utterly fabricated 'hmmmms' every time you mention anything. You're brought peanuts and a paper napkin which is charged for on your bill! If you've ever had crispy duck, this ain't it. It's a pre cooked duck deep fried in cooking oil. They bring it out on a trolley, demand you take a photo of it, 'hmmmms' all around again before removing the crispy skin ( no meat) and together with 6 microwave steamed pancakes, 4 tiny tiny cucumber sticks and a bit of ginger and hoisin sauce were left to it. The rest of the duck returned later in a different dish which was okay and we had some egg fried rice and one beer. Total bill $67 singapore dollars. Even though service was included, they still demanded a tip. Not good

We we're recommend to this restaurant and we weren't disappointed , the meal was excellent seafood clay pot what a meal , the fried rice was the best I ever had then to top it of the mango pudding yum yum , and will be going bac

Having been to Fatty Weng three times during our two last visits to Singapore, I struggle to understand why Fatty does not score higher in TA.We have kept going because we love the duck. We always order a full duck for 4'and a few more dishes on top. The peking duck is just fantastic. All other dishes are equally good. Unfortunately, this year, even if the restaurant has been refurbished, they did not offer the amazing dim sums of the past.Lunch for 4 (inc the whole duck) cost us around $125. So a very good value for the lovely food you get.We will go back everytime we visit Sg
4
In the crowd of this highly touristic area, with so many stalls and shops selling all those goods "China made", still a good address for generic Chinese food. Nothing regional nor really authentic however really fantastic Fatty Wang pork ribs, really delicious. Sichuan style prawns were goods as well though not really spicy. Good, really good roasted chicken with soya sauce. Expect 25 SGD per pax including a Tiger beer
5
Stopped in after some shopping in Chinatown looking for somewhere cool to eat. The food was great... We had noodle soup and shredded duck with noodles and was authentic Chinese flavours for a great price. Spotted the chilli crab and BBQ duck so will definitely be back again
5
The restaurant have finally opened after the refurbishment. Really nice interior inside. However abit cold - will need a jacket.
As before - Food very good. Best Sweet&Sour pork... :-)
1
As of July 2013, restaurant closed for renovations. Unclear when it will reopen. Plenty of yum cha in vicinity, however quality may - or may not -be as good.
3
I realize that this is a tourist favorite but I wasn't impressed. They really cram the customers together and there's little to no a/c. The duck was just okay.One good result is that we ended up meeting a very nice Australian couple next to us and had a nice chat. Otherwise, I just didn't enjoy my experience at all
5
An escape from the wonderful hawker and more casual joints. Fatty Weng's provides actual table service in a clean, air-conditioned restaurant. Though casual by Western standards, it's certainly a step up in formality from the hawker centers.But the highlight is the food. We had perfect pepper crab, salt-and-pepper prawns, and Malaysian vegetables (though the vegetables -- sauteed with fermented shrimp paste -- might be a bit pungent for blander Western palates). Service was earnest and friendly, even if it wasn't at flawless Michelin-starred levels.There's a reason why Fatty Weng's is one of the only actual restaurants along Smith Street that don't have someone outside actively soliciting your business: they don't need to

Visited Chinatown in the middle of last December and restaurant was very much closed with little sign of any renovations going on - so pleased to read it is back in business again ! Location is good and the street outside was in the process of being covered over to make an enclosed pedestrian / food street. This should probably be done by now and I am looking forward to my next there in April - and to check out the food at the new Da Dong - report will follow then
3
Usually visit Da Dong in Chinatown a few times during my trips to Singapore. Turned up there early April and found the place closed up with a sign in the window that it was undergoing renovation for six months. No obvious evidence of any building work etc going on and no clue as to a date as to when it would reopen, or even when the renovation work started - guess it might be back in operation towards end of this year 2013. I am back in Singapore Nov/ Dec and look forward to a visit - food was usually pretty good
5
Whenever I visit Singapore I never book a room with breakfast included.A long time ago I discovered the "Da Dong" restaurant in Smith street and if you plan your day day correctly, Da Dongs Yum Cha there can be just about the best brunch on the planet setting you up for the rest of the day.The restaurant is simply furnished and service is attentive and fast. The Dim Sum are worthy of the highest accolades that Dim Sum can acquire.The huge array of Dim Sum (steamed, fried and baked) are prepared fresh every day and washed down with a pot of jasmine tea represent the perfect way to start any day.Inexpensive and tasty this is a chance to discover the wonders of Chinese Yum Cha at its traditional best
3
This was not a particularly memorable experience. The food was lacking in taste and the way it was served up was pretty grim too.The Bai Lin mushrooms with vegetables were totally tasteless. The special bean curd with brocolli and mushroom was poor.The chicken with dried chilli was ok and the salt and pepper prawns were not fresh, the Beef Hor Fun would have been ok but the beef was dry and overcooked.The staff were semi attentive but seemed pre-occupied with some private party going on upstairs. Doubt if I would return. Prices were similar to Jumbo Seafood the quality was not
2
Food was yummy, but as everyone has said, it is a rip off. I was savvy enough to send back the nuts and wet towel napkins ( they then brought out paper napkins)... But I forgot to ask about the crab. I had had chilli crab several times before after living in Singapore for 6 months. We asked for a small one, but I didn't ask the price or the weight. Big mistake. The bill came out and it was $58 for the crab alone. I asked the question and thu told me market price was $6.80 per 100g , and our crab was 900g. In my head I knew this was expensive- a hawker has crab for $3.80 per 100g, and that our crab was no where near 900g, but more like 600g. As we had already eaten it, I had no argument. Also, when eating the crab, I noticed it was not the full crab. Normally they cut the body into 4 so you get. Meaty part plus 3 small legs in 1 piece. They had removed 1-2 small legs from our crab and they were not part of the dish. After (reluctantly) paying the bill we left. On the way out, I asked to touting man outside how much the crab sitting in the tank was, and he said it was a big size and should cost about $45 for one that size. I balked, told him we paid $58 and walked off fuming. Although the food was yummy- we also had duck noodle and seafood fried rice ( with minimal, small frozen seafood), I would never go back after being so blatantly ripped off. Places like this give Singapore and Singaporeans a bad name.

I've been several times to Da Dong restaurant and if I keep coming back there it is because, despite the fact that it is a highly touristic area, they managed to keep their authentic Chinese character for the food, the interior decoration, and the service. The food quality is good. I recommend
2
we choose this resturant following the lonely planet suggestion, and for the first time we were quite disappointed. We choose a plate with several different appetizer but only one of them was wort the price ($70!). Service quite rude. We wouldn't recommend it.
4
Great food and fast service. Do try out their Peking Duck which is served in the same way as it is done in Beijing.
2
I was looking for dim sum but only menu tor tourists available at Night.... noodles band prawns ...to share... 60dollars... do note recommend..better Street food..
4
Lunch was fantastic, a little pricey. We started with Peking Duck a real winner. Also had Sweet & Sour Pork along with Schezuan styled Prawns (fresh and Tasty). Tiger Beer is reasonably priced and cold. We did pay for the hand wipes only 50c each, we were not charged for the nuts. Never assume anything is free, we got offered Desert but knocked it back, not sure how being offered desert is a scam. Great location for watching people and the owner / manager is entertaining, listening to his spruiking
1
Oh boy. I wish I had looked at reviews on Tripadvisor before eating here. The people working in this place have finely honed rip-off skills. We, like so many other reviewers, fell for the mango scam. It is not complimentary, nor are the nuts or the wet towels. The food is nice but really over priced. If you're walking past and hear "Hello, China food" keep going. In fact, head to Maxwell Road food alley. Cheap, delicious, huge choice from a number of food stalls and a buzzing happy atmosphere. Ours was a rookie error which we will put down to experience
2
Stay away from this restaurant as it will rip you off. Food was nice but it charge you for the peanuts and hand towels put on table which you did not ask for and the lady conned you to saying yes to a mango dessert which you will assume it's complimentary but they actually charge you $15 for. At the end our meals cost more than $120 for 2 adults and 2 children in a not very nice atmosphere restaurant so even though the food was quite tasty the experience left a very bad taste! It would of been cheaper to go to the raffles

I stopped off in this restaurant after wandering around Chinatown district. I ate outside, and had a good view of the comings and goings of this busy area. The Main Waiter, kept advising me how to eat prawn crackers as I was apparently eating them too slowly..U started with crab-meat corn soup and had a main course of beef with sir fry vegetable and some prawn crackers along with 3 lime juices it came to S$47. They had also added in S$0.50 for a towel that had neither asked for or actually got. Quite a few places in chinatown area are doing this now.It was mainly tourists, myself included that seemed to frequent the place.The food was good and the service was fast.I felt it was a little pricy for what it was
3
Not having been in Singapore for a few years I fell for the "Value added" scams of receiving a bowl of peanuts when I ordered a beer. After ordering Chilli Crab we were given a few packets of "wet wipes". These all appeared on the bill. I found the food to be very good but well overpriced for the surrounds. I hate scams and will not return
4
A good friend and local citizen suggested this place as one of her favorite restaurants in the Chinatown part of Singapore. The service was great. The food was good too, but I'm not sure I'd get the same thing next time, and am somewhat ignorant when it comes to Chinese food. It was busy, that's for sure, and full of tourists and locals
5
The food we ordered was ok but expensive given the surrounds. however i do object to being charged for peanuts and hand towels we didn't order. we were also brow beaten into ordering a sliced mango which was ordinary and expensive. yoy'll do better at a hawker's marke
5
for the best Peking Duck combined with friendly service the Da Dong is the place, absolutely brilliant!!!!
4
Enjoyed great food in the centre of Chinatown. The prawns over scrambled eggs and noodles was excellent. We were disappointed to pay for hand napkins and a small bowl of peanuts left on the table.
4
we have been here 4 times. we love the dim sum in the morning. the staff is polite and very helpful. we also liked the shrimp, the three combination platter and hor fun.
1
I payed $30 for a small portion of mediocre roast duck. Go across the street to the hawker center under the mall and you can get better food for a fraction of the cost. The hawker center is more for locals I guess, but ordering is easy enough

One day during our last trip to Singapore after a particularly expensive meal the day earlier we decided to save some money and have good food at the same time by visiting the China Town. My experience with most city China Town, and including Singapore, has been of good inexpensive food albeit in a pedestrian ambience. So after some walking around we chose to enter this restaurant which had a half way descent indoor seating. Immediately upon seating we were accosted by the elderly steward who wanted to give suggestions even before we have had a look at the menu. Finally he manged to brow beat us into ordering fried 'soon hock' fish for SG$50 for 600gms fish. He served us Jasmine tea and peanuts without asking. We wanted confirmation that the fish was a single bone fish which he confirmed. After about 15 minutes our order arrived with steamed rice. The fish had one head and two three tails. Immediately we knew this could not be a single bone fish. Anyway it was tasty but difficult to eat with all the bones. My wife was scared through out the meal having gone through a messy boney experience with a fish meal recently. We did not want to venture out for any other item and paid the bill for over SG$66 and came out. we were charged for tea, peanuts,paper towels. We felt cheated which is our first in China Town that too in Singapore

Hi, This place is maybe a bit pricy compared to other joints in the neighbourhood but if you are staying a couple of days in Singapore happen to be in Chinatown and would like to have a nice food experience this is the place. I recommend lunch only! Food is great and you have plenty to choose from! Do not forget to try one of the dim sum dishes as well as the chicken in lemon sauce. Both are excellent.This is supposedly one of the oldest restaurants in Chinatown and the high ceiling and fans makes it nice to be inside even during very hot days. It has a sort of open air feeling even if it is indoors.Service is very friendly and staff knows the food they are serving so they can easily help you out with the menu and see to it that you make the right choices. I can also recommend the peeking duck served traditionally and very tasty with the plum sauce
4
Wish we'd seen some of these reviews first! We had Pekin duck and mixed veggies. Both were very tasty and the service was fast and polite.A little surprised about the peanuts and hand towels. Also "gave" us some custard tarts which appeared to be "complements of the chef" but were $3 on the bill.I would say go there but be very clear what you are getting and what you are paying for

the worst ever service encountered and i entertain alot mind youthe captain, 50 yr old local is there just so that he gets his payand the 3 china girls are at sea literallyhis bochap and si lao beh looks make you vomitwhen I asked for plum sauce the third time for the roast porkhe was like angry and called out loudly to one of the girlsone of the girls poured out nearly all our bottle of royal saluteinto the 8 whisky glasses to nearly 3/4 full!!!fatty weng boss, yr restaurant will chup lup in no time if yr captain stays on..take it seriousl

I can't believe how we were treated at this restaurant. I wish we had walked out. We were forced in to ordering crab which my husband went along unfortunately! The waiter ( owner I think) snatched my menu off me and I said to him "you mean to tell me I can't choose something else?" He was a male chauvenistic pig. I ordered duck. The finger bowl that came with my husbands crab looked like a brown rusty colour. It was expensive and tasted terrible. We got charged for nuts and a towel wipe ( which we did not order). It ruined our evening as I almost fell out with husband since he was more willing to go along with being bullied in to ordering what the owner wanted us to get. Obviously he needed to get rid of crab. We had one course and it cost $89.90. He also added on a 10% tip. Totally ripped off and I would never eat here or suggest anyone ever eat here. Go to McDonalds
5
We ate here for both lunch and breakfast. Our lunch was delicious and so too the yum cha for breakfast. It is a bit pricey. If they bring out a bowl of peanuts you get charged. The packets of face wipes will also see you being charged regardless if you use them or not so make sure the bill excludes them if you don't use them
5
We had a fabulous lunch here- fresh handmade tofu and mushrooms and honey spare ribs- both excellent choices. We didnt realise they are famous for their duck, so will try thayt next time.Not cheap but worth every cent- very tasty food.
3
The food at Da Dong's is fantastic. We had a light meal of stir-fry vegetables and ginger beef: the vegetables were crisp and fresh; the beef and ginger soooo good we had to finish the sauce as well.Service is OK, but what really annoyed us was being charged $2++ for the world's smallest bowl of peanuts and 50c for each hand wipe, both which we incorrectly assumed were complimentary. A small gripe, but it tarnished an otherwise great dinner.Watch out for the ++ tax of 17% to

Visited this during the recent F1 in Singapore. A very hot day and what a delight when we entered to be offered a table upstairs that was air-conditioned. We were greeted cheerfully and decided to let the owner order for us. A sensational meal was had, and overall I would say it was very nice and despite other reviews I found it to be ok. Lots of locals eating here which was encouraging and a nice buzz about the place.I did find the charge for wet wipes a bit of humour and agree with previous reviews that this may be a tourist trap, however we had a good time and found it inexpensive
2
The Da Dong restaurant is a basic restaurant tailored to local tastes, the food is to a high standard, but be careful when eating here...this restaurant is in the middle of China Town and as such it must see its fair share of tourists, who will be paying more than the locals for what they eat. Having told the waitress that we were not tourists (as we are caucasian), she still tried every trick to get us to part with more of our money. With there being only two of us she tried to get us to upsize all our dishes as well as delivering to us the biggest fish I have ever seen for dinner. As the price was based on the weight of the fish.We had rice, kang kong and lemon chicken, all of which were cooked to a good standard, but then we were faced with the Moby Dick of fishes....Moby Dick was tasty, but difficult to eat with all the bones, he also appeared to have changed weights before hitting our bill at a hefty price which more than weighed out the cost of the rest of our dinner and the shopping we had done in China Town earlier.As I said be careful eating here......

We dined here early evening on a hot singapore afternoon. The staff were very helpful and super friendly - they were really great with helping with the menu as to the size portions we needed as we were dining with our 15 month old son. Duck was yummy and copious for 3 adults. We had chinese beer which was good and the restaurant has a load of highchairs which is always a plus.When we got back home from our holiday we noticed that the restaurant had charged us twice - we were really angry as there was nothing we could do about it. The next day we checked our bank and were pleased to see that they had noticed the mistake and had got in touch with the credit card company and refunded the amount as well as sending through an apology and a discount for next time we are in Singapore. We were really happy with this - well done Da Dong!

This Place (I'd dare not accuse it of being a Restaurant) is in 39 Smith St China town. It has been a long time since I have seen such rude outwardly obnoxious service in any business let alone in a restaurant anywhere in the world. Farmers treat their livestock with more decency and respect than we were treated here. We asked to go upstairs which I know know was a mistake because it is more difficult to escape. There are a small bowl of peanuts and 2 mist towels on the table as you arrive and you'll find them on the bill at $2 +$1 whether you want them or not, this is of course on top of the mandatory 10% service charge and 17% GST. We tried the Dim Sum which is again a mistake because you have to rely on the rude almost hateful staff. They barked at us like we were animals. The small amount of food we did actually get to try was only edible due to our hunger. We just had the 1st selection of Dim Sum and had to wait 25 mins or more to try and get the waitress which by this time was to try and get the bill and get out of the joint.The only pleasing part of the experience was leaving. It was a shocking experience and Very ordinary very overpriced food. My girlfriend didn't even leave 5 cents for a tip which is the first time I've seen her do that

Recently while visiting Chinatown in Singapore my wife and I chose to eat at Da Dong.. We selected items from the menu outside the door and were then shown to our table by a very polite waitress. The meal arrived and was indeed very nice and presented well, as we were in a rush we did without dessert and requested the bill. I had roughly estimated about S$30 for both meals and was shocked when the bill totalled S$85. When questioned, the waitress told us the menu outside "only displayed small portions" she thought we would like to share our meals and provided medium dishes. The accompanying fried rice was an "extra" at S$15 a portion. Also, when we arrived at our table there were peanuts and tissues already on the table, these items were then added on the bill,- $2 for peanuts and $1 each for tissue. It was plain the staff were used to people complain as they seemed to have "manufactured answers " for everything. Dishonest merchants like these deserve to be put out of business and the only way to do that is not to eat there. Food is great but its great everywhere in Chinatown

My sister and I really happened to chance upon this restaurant, while we were in Chinatown four hours ago.As we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by a tall, Chinese waiter, who ushered us to a table. Being the festive season, he started off by recommending the 'Yu Sheng' (SGD 28++), which is traditionally eaten by the Chinese to usher in a new year full of abundance and advancement.We really wanted a simple meal, so we declined his kind recommendation. He tried in vain to persuade us to try the dish. After that, he tried to recommend other kinds of 'expensive' dishes - roast peking duck, etc.We politely declined. We chose to order just a plate of fried noodles ('ee mian') (SGD10)and sweet and sour fish (SGD12). We could see the look of disdain in his eyes. After he has finished taking down our order, his co-worker asked him about our order, and you could hear him repeating our order in a sarcastic tone.I was dismayed with his attitude. Thankfully, a courteous waitress served our dishes with a smile. The food was tasty, but seriously, even some foreigners from more affluent Western countries might find the food expensive.The crowd was mainly Western tourists, who probably can afford and won't mind spending above average prices on Chinese fare.My advice is: Unless you are NOT travelling on budget, you may want to try this restaurant, if you happen to be in Chinatown. As I understand it, it's one of the oldest Singapore restaurants around, with a history that dates back to 1928

First, the food was fine. Just fine.Also, the upstairs is well air conditioned. It will feel good on a hot and humid Singapore night.I dined at this restaurant with a large group of friends. The manager came to serve us, and as I am picking my $14 SGD dish that I would like to eat, he suggested a family style meal, of which he will pick the menu and set a per person price. This sounds reasonable, particularly for a Chinese restaurant. He also started pushing the Pecking Duck (which I hate, but some friends really wanted). The manager came back to propose a 3 course meal (egg rolls, many main dishes for the table to share, and MANGOS for dessert). The first price given was about $35/person. Then, when I pointed out that a quarter of our party only eats chicken, he hesitantly added a chicken dish... and then between the duck and the chicken, we were up to $40, maybe $45/person. He wasn't specific. At some point I heard we were at $50/person. Nothing more was ordered. I can tell you that we left at $75/person, including service. I never had a chance to see the bill, so I was curious how we got up to that point. Perhaps the other reviews of charging for the wet towels that were set at the table explains some of that. Some of the people in our party mentioned how they felt that we were a bit taken as we left. It didn't site right with me.Although the food was fine, I am sure there are other places to dine that won't leave you with a uncertain feeling
2
Food was fine, but servers must be on commission and push costly extras.Server enthused about mangos being fresh and demanded we order them for dessert. (Our fault for not being firmer.)Two plain sliced mangos were billed at $15. Bill alsom included $1 for towel wipes on tables and other bogus charges.Steer clear - you will spend far more than the place is worth
