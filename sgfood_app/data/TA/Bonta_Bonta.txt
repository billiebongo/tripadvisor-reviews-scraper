The food was average. Was expecting the unagi to be very nice as per the picture n it being premium. The soup they serve before the dishes were served was good for the palate.

Nice soup, price a little high in singapore context but in Japan context is consider normal. Food fresh.

One of my favourite places for a good Japanese rice bowl - great quality and value! Had the unagi and tamago rice bowl and enjoyed it very much :)

Many restaurants at Japan Food Town in Wisma, orchard. But we decided on Bonta Bonta (Japan Food Town). Small restaurant but very cosy.

Good Food and getting crowded in a short period of time. Will recommend singles and solos to go if you need good food after working long hours!

Can't ask for any better in terms of quality and value for money. The quality is always consistent. Generous portions of free rice. The condiments are just as good. Love my rice dotted with sesame seeds.

There was a ‘Kindai Maguro’ show on 1Jan2018 which 2 Chef cut a 40kg tuna from Japan and the fish was distributed to a couple of the outlets at Jalan Food Town, and Bonta was one of them, meal and sides were Super oiishi and the sashimi was fresh

We ordered the basic Four-Grilled Don Set (Grilled unagi, salmon, fluke-fin and squid) and the Special Donmaru Set (Tuna, minced tuna, salmon roe, sea urchin and squid) to try out, since it was our first visit.The food was exquisitely presented and satisfactory in enjoyment. The "kinme mai" rice was suitably moist and very tasty. However, the dashi broth was mild and nondescript (lacking the characteristic burnt flavour of bonito etc).Premises has limited seating and space though, and the closed proximity among diners was rather uncomfortable for us. The serving staff however was amiable and helpful

If you decide to try this tiny hole in the wall restaurant at wisma atria shopping center, just order their Unagi dons. Shipped in from Japan, the eel is dense, meaty and flavorful. All guests all receive complimentary dashi broth which is decent.Apart from that, the sashimi, salad and other dishes are just poor. Sashimi especially is just not good at all and there are much better options around Orchard Road

This is fast becoming our go to place in Orchard for a tasty and healthy Japanese rice bowl. You are served a delicious pot of dashi soup while waiting for your main course.The rice bowl toppings come in a variety of combinations - most a combination of different sashimi. Prices are wallet friendly with most of the basic rice bowls under SGD20 (usd 15). Service is efficient and friendly. We definitely recommend Bonta Bonta

Went twice for their rice bowls - superb fresh ingredients and every bite was tasty and delightful. Will visit again!

Food was underwhelming. Sea urchin was not very fresh. Rice & dashi was nice. Was disappointed with the food.
4
Very fresh ingredients and good quality. Limited choices mostly on seafood. Overall very good Japanese dining experience.
3
Food is good. However, the table seating is limited. So for big group, it is not a good place to go .
5
The food is fresh and great. Quite cheap. The portion are not big though. We still went twice in 4 days...

First time here and we ordered the Unagi Kabayaki Don (Whole) and Premium Fresh Seafood Bowl. We expected the whole unagi to bigger, but it was still really tasty. As for the premium seafood bowl, it was one of the best I ever had, all the seafood in it were really fresh and sweet and in abundance. Would definitely be dropping by again in the future!

If you happen to be at Wisma Atria and fancy a simple Japanese meal, head to Bonta Bonta (located next to Food RepublicThe place was small. Maybe 10-12 at any one seating. And only one big table of six. The rest were counter seats. But I was satisfied with my humble rice bowl. Bonta Bonta doesn't pretend to be anything else. Lots of confusing promos but worth the hassle for some good deals. I am thankful to the staff on duty who was patiently trying to explain the promos

We decided to drop by Tokyo town in Wisma Atrium for a late lunch and since Bonto bonto, specializing in Kaisen don was one of the few restaurants opened we gave it a try. They start off with a teapot filled with hot tasty dashi. I actually thought it was tea. Then our entrees of fatty melt in your mouth salmon don and maguro don followed. It was delicious. I ordered the grilled don of unagi, salmon and ika too which was prepared with perfection atop rice. It was truly splendid though you may have to order 2 bowls since the portions are a bit small.
3
I ordered premium unagi rice. Unagi was fresh, good. But the portion just too small for the price. Not really worth. My friend ordered sashimi rice, small portion too and not really worth the price. Food only average. I am a big eater, i understand i couldnt expect any shop out there to serve my size of portion but this is just too small for me. Ive been to other famous shop who sell unagi as well, theirs are expensive, big portion and with reasonable price instead of bonta bonta. I dont think i am coming back again.

Frequent diner at this restaurant as they serves one of the best value for money premium Kaisen Dons! Fresh and wide variety of sashimi slices on the rice bowls. The only downside is the small area (seating for about 15 pax?) and you might have to wait quite a bit.
