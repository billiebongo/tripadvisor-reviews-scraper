Celebrated best buddy's birthday on 24 Jan 2018. the 3 of us ordered the spring set dinner, about $120 per pax plus a bottle of NZ wine! Though it's a little pricey, but it's worth it!
I will definitely go back again!

Taste & presentation of food was good. However would have expected better service for a fine dining restaurant. Worth trying but wouldn't come back
5
Very nice ambience and private rooms are perfect for business settings and celebration dinners. The food is also done very nicely and great service too. The restaurant also revolves so the view changes which is a nice touch.
5
Ambience was good, service was tip-top and food was awesome. My guests enjoyed the high class treatment.
4
Revolving restaurant as we sat in our private room. The service was impeccable and staff was attentive and alert. The food was interesting - excellent and elegant preparation. Our food menu cost around $250++/pax. It is worth a visit with the ambiance, view & food.

Great view of Marina Bay but just be aware that the restaurant rotates and it takes 2 hours to go one revolution. I am not sure but I think the restaurant tries to give you a table with a view of Marina which you can enjoy for about 30 minutes before your are facing away from the Marina and staring at office buildings. The rotating restaurant made me a bit dizzy but so I got used to it after 15 minutes.Most of the set meal was good but not exceptional. The tempura lobster and sticky rice was very good. The wine was very expensive.
4
Very refined - albeit not sublime - food, using expensive ingredients. Excellent wines on offer. Service is professional but s bit too stiff. High prices and stuffy atmosphere make this venue more appropriate for business entertaining where the need to impress is high, than for celebrations with family and friends

My Wife celebrated her 60th birthday here 5 years ago. My Son must have been impressed to select it for his Low key wedding there. Service was great. An appropriate place to solemnise wedding and arrangement was made by the restaurant for a wedding tea ceremony. The dinner for 17 pax was about 3500 including a few bottles of wine. Considering it is a revolving restaurant with very personalised service, it was a good deal. The food was very good and service impeccable. My Son could not have selected a better place for his very special occasion. More joy when I found out that my TungLok first card qualifies for a 10% rebate

My friends booked a table at the restaurant which offered a scenic view of the marina Bay Area. The restaurant is a revolving restaurant and sits on the 10th floor of what used to be the former Neptune restaurant. Cosseted in our private room, the service was impeccable and the wait staff was attentive and alert. The food was interesting : roast pork, wild fish, bird’s nest and baked lobster. Including a really expensive wine which we shared amongst the 6 of us, the bill was about $220 per pax. I can’t fault the food - excellent preparation and elegant preparation Coupled with the view, it is worth a visit.
4
Was here last night with my family. Food was great, not over the top. Service was friendly. Nice experience since it’s revolving but a little giddy at times. We had the Spring Cherish set menu. The marble goby in pickled vegetable broth was surprisingly good, crackling pork was slightly dry. It will be better to serve wine by glass. Fantastic night view of the marina bay at level 8!
4
Excellent host / reception. Was most helpful to change rsvp at the last minute to incl more pax. Lovely ambience.
3
The dinner was just an ordinary dinner. Food was average. Although it is a revolvoing restaurant, the view was not as great as we expected.
The revolving mechanism needs attention. The constant clicking noise and vibration from the floor was not pleasant at all.
5
Very nice of them to decorate the table with happy birthday greetings and a complimentary deserts that come w candle. Needless to say the food was fantastic. We choose set of $120 惜春。 The staff were warm and friendly.
4
Itâ€™s a revolving restaurant on 10th floor with a spectacular view. Try to go there during the dinner to enjoy the view. The food is good but not excellent and bit expensive. I thinks with its revolving thing and view thing, the cost is somewhat ok
3
Perfect Location; with the rotary restaurant, dinner accompany with 5stars view throughout.Very warmth welcome once we step into the restaurant. Superb wine recommendation.Appetizer did not give us any surprises. Food and ingredient creativity have some improvement area.Thanks to restaurant prepared a mooncake wishing for our anniversary :)
5
I went for the Spring Cherish dinner menu and was very pleasantly surprised when they gave us some exclusive complimentary desserts between our soup and main courses. The food quality is really good and well prepared from the kitchen all the way till it arrives at your table. Truly a great restaurant to bring your partner to enjoy the 360 view of Singapore as well as to watch the Marina Bay Light Show while enjoying a very private and romantic evening dinner

~why just very good, I always shudder when I look at the bill here! but no doubt the tantalizing tastes you're gonna be exposed to is still excellent~a 13pax group with set lunch menus including 4 vegetarians, well prepared and serviced, any dish will compare well with a Michelin starred restauranttaken 2016Oct lookup the photos

I was impressed with the excellence service provided by the staffs. I called up to make a pre-order of the menu and request via Ms June, the lady who attended to me with lovely tune of voice and initiated great offer such as arranged for a private room just for the both of us. My friend was surprised and stunned with the professional approached by each staff who attended to us during the dinning experience. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all the staffs, Keep up the awesome" WOW" attitude with all the beautiful smiles on, you are the best
5
A great experience for dining at a Chinese cuisine fine dining that comparable to a western fine dining. The food are delicious and well decorated for both non-vegetarian and vegetarian 6-course meal.Not forgetting the stunning view that you could see the surrounding buildings, and Marina Bay night view is romantic indeed.We had a wonderful birthday celebration that came with a complimentary special decorated pastry (not chocolate cake..but was nice & not sweet)!
4
As the name suggests , this revolving restaurant at OUE tower is for private dining , there are sections created that offer quite time. Views are nice , slightly hindered by the light reflecting from the restaurant but still good.Food is Chinese ,my partner and I ordered the vegetarian set menu , which was decent,though I wish they had some more spicy options in this set. Service was on spot , considering the lowest price set would also set you back by 200+ $ this quality was expected.The place is good for a quite relaxing evening 
4
The view of the restaurant is very nice.
The food is quite delicate.
Will recommend for business dining.

Interesting dining place in a revolving tower. Food wasn't impressive. Was expecting a lot more from Tong Le, unfortunately it was a disappointment.
5
Enjoyed a very good set menu for lunch in this beautiful set out revolving restaurant
The views complimented the food and excellent wine list
The overall experience was excellent highly recommend
5
Very good food and services ! It was my wife's birthday celebration dinner and they purposely arrange a fried rice for my 5yrs old son and special cake for my wife.
We enjoyed our dinner here and definitely will come back !
3
Food was alright but not exceptionally different or special.
Noodle was rather salty.
Partner was feeling a bit of headache due to the turning of the restaurant.
4
Took the $80 menu but was a little disappointed as i compared against the last round with the same pricing. The dishes were so much nicer and agreeable to the value that I paid.
4
Ordered the $80 and $120 menu. Vast difference but not worlds apart.Service was prompt and non intrusive, the set menus were fixed and explanation was given in cards placed in front of you. The revolving of the restaurant is ok, NOT to the extend of being dizzy (which i laughed at a certain review).I think good chinese food is served here, its fusion but doesnt lose its origin
5
This upscale restaurant provides a great private dining environment for groups small and large10 stories up the rotating floor provides every changing 360 views of Singapore The wine and sake selection will meet your needs They have fixed price dining experiences that make your pallet smile. Left their very full and have included pictures with my post of various dishes and the view

My rating of Tong Le reflects the agreeable ambiance, the good service and the revolving feature of the restaurant but the cooking was rather varied in our experience with some outstanding dishes and others that were less impressive. A starter of lobster with egg white was delicious and different whilst the pumpkin dessert was a bit ho, hum. More disappointingly, the noodles with Alaskan king crab did not do justice to that magnificent ingredient let alone the air miles it had put in. The up market wine list is impressive and the sommelier very knowledgeable but he will endeavour to upsell you quite blatantly (ask for a simple white and you'll be offered a Grand Cru). If you wish to spice things up you should ask for vinegar or chili to your taste as they are not put on the table. Tong Le means "happiness together" and you can certainly have a fun evening there in one of the well appointed private dining rooms as you take in the ever changing external view, and the staff will be very attentive, but the kitchen is unlikely to hit culinary heights on a consistent basis. Whilst there are individual tables between the private dining rooms I imagine it would be a little soulless to eat at them
5
A top pick if you want to impress foreign visitors with a panoramic view of the Singapore skyline in the financial district and Marina Bay Sands while enjoying fine Chinese cuisine. Their set menus allow you to sample their signature dishes and each course is served in individual portion with attention to presentation. Staff are attentive and helpful with recommendations, making it an excellent dining experience
3
Food was hit and miss. Noodle was delicious but beef was disappointing. Staff was really great. Love the service
5
Exquisite cuisine and beautifully presented. Lovely view of the bay, good for special occasions and romantic outing. Food is fusion but incorporates the best of Western Chinese and Japanese influences. Worth a visit.

From the time we called Tong Le Private Dining to make reservations for lunch (the next day) until we left, I was impressed with their friendly and attentive service.This is high-end fine Chinese dining with individual plates of 6 courses being served, at a well-paced manner.Our menu cost SGD80 ++, and each decadent course was delicious and adequately portioned.There were sauteed fish with egg white (a light but appetising first dish), chicken soup with lobster dumpling (which was delectable), steamed wild fish (one of the freshest and delicate fish dish I have ever tasted), Jiang Nan style braised pork belly (too fatty for my liking), tender Irish duck with springy noodles (which I rather enjoyed although I am not a fan of duck) and Tang Yuan for dessert (I always enjoy this Chinese dessert).They are accommodating, and could have changed the pork belly to either a prawn or chicken dish instead.The 6 courses were more than sufficient and pleasingly presented, and we were well sated.They even provided us with a small private dining room, which is conducive for business discussions.They were almost full, on a Friday afternoon.Highly recommended if guests or family prefer Chinese food in this area, in a classy restaurant ambience with great panaromic views thrown in for good measure.You enter via a private lift entrance, at the foot of OUE tower

~not for the faint hearted, or one time splurge, this is a destination venue worth visiting as much for it's fine dining as the magnificent ambience in beautiful Marina Bay~this was an impromptu team lunch, we'd walked past the Tower hundreds of times, never actually went inside for a meal with whispers of it being too expensive for the working crowd!~after our team meeting we made a reservation barely 2 hours ahead, and we'd printed the lunch set menus online (looks affordable) to decide which we're gonna select~I'd a UOB 30% Discount for Tong Le so everything looks great :)~one mistake, it's mine so you don't make it. The set menus are not for when you have a discount voucher... don't use the vouchers unless you wanna order from the normal menu!~the restaurant revolves and we'd 360 amazing views which adds to the ambience~Sous Chef Kelvin Tham came out to our table to explain many of the dishes which were lovely, he caught the eye of one of our colleagues and gave her special treats!~one of the more eye opening dishes was served on a heated salt slab much like a sizzling hotplate but less intense, it's used for raw beef slices to cook over and absorb the salt for seasoning... he actually packed one of those slabs for us to take home as they could not be reused and were discarded after just a single use at the restaurant~Kelvin the Sous Chef told us to heat the salt slab in the microwave for 10mins and we can cook any raw meat on itregardless of the prices, each and every single dish that was sent to our table was delicious and a feast for both eh eyes and mouth, it'll set you back a bomb to eat here but a worthwhile experience :
5
Warmly welcome into the revolving tower by lovely hostess which ushered us to level 10 where the restaurant was. Had a private room which comes with a magnificent view that changes as it revolves slowly thru the evening. Only set menu available which was ok with us. Each item was served timely as it progressed. Every dish was beautifully presented that makes the palette lingers with the appetite. Another bonus was the free corkage of a bottle of wine when you order another with the restaurant. Definitely a lovely evening with my team , and already looking forward to the next reservations with them .

I was invited to dinner here as a special treat - one of my uncles was the architect and my cousin thought it would be nice if we went for dinner while on holiday. A very nice gesture. The restaurant is on the 10th floor and can revolve fully in 30 mins - usually not set to that as it's pretty fast. I think it took 1.5 - 2 hours for one revolution the night we visited. We found the staff to be professional. The food was cooked well (if very small portions) and some of the dishes were very interesting, e.g. the dessert used test tubes and you mixed different ingredients together. It's not for everyone but I enjoyed the meal. I think it's very expensive - much more than what the dishes, service, etc. are worth but at the same time, it's an experience (although not one I would say you must absolutely have when visiting Singapore).

Sited at OUE Tower, this restaurant occupies the previous revolving Restauant site. One turn is about two hours and has a good view of Marina Bay. We had a set menu and it was done elegantly. Service was good and they did have a good wine selection.

Tong Le Private Dining serves fusion Chinese food. It closed on Sunday. Located at Collyer Quay. 5 minutes walk from Raffles Place MRT. Limited tables. Reservation recommended.It's a revolving restaurant facing Marina Bay with good view of the city lights. Personalised waiter and waitress to attend to individual table. Small portion of tasty food with wine made a perfect match. The cod was exceptionally fresh and melted in the mouth. Dessert was also refreshing.Truly enjoyed this dinner. $440 for 2 persons

- I have visited the restaurant to celebrate my birthday and thank you for your interest .- for me The food I eat was first time in my life and leave with an excellent impression .- I have loved mixing between the Chinese and the Japanese in the way food .- The restaurant offers views of where is going in a circular motion .- Staff on high quality 
5
It was our first visit to Tong Le private dining , in a heritage listed building . The service was impeccable. The food was excellent and an interesting combination of old fashioned Cantonese and modern. The crunchy duck rolls were totally delicious, the abalone succulent and tender and the scallop was excellent. The presentation was stunning. The building is interesting, it is a 1970's design and a revolving restaurant, which offers amazing views of MBS, the cbd etc. you can take photos from floor 8 so the Windows don't reflect A very enjoyable dinne

Just love this fine dining venue. I've been taken here as a client by business associates many times; then I had to return to dine with family & friends out of my own pockets simply because I have to share the amazing experience I've had. I've tried holiday set dinner (with friends); vegetarian set lunch (with friend); ala carte lunch (with family); and many business lunch/dinners. Their food & service never disappointed us. The menu is innovative and changing from time to time, the presentation is so artistic, and the 360 degree revolving view is just divine. A bit pricy though. Highly recommended

Having been swayed by glowing reviews of this place from trusted blogs before deciding to try their version of Chinese fine dining, my experience turned out to be extremely disappointing. I only write reviews for the extreme experiences, either good or bad... and this time, I felt compelled enough to write a review so that whoever decides to try the restaurant can be more informed of what they are getting themselves into. Perhaps it was an ominous sign of things to come when my call to the restaurant 1 week before the reservation went unanswered. I then decided to send an email instead. 2 days later, when I didn't get any reply, I decided to call them again and finally made the reservations with the admittedly helpful reservation agent. Nothing very wrong here except that only 1 day before my reservation did I receive another call to apologise for missing my email! Nonetheless, I was still anticipating a great dinner there on a Saturday night for a birthday celebration for my friend. Given that it was a special occasion, we had the $180 menu (we eventually paid excess of 220 per person without any wine). Set in a standalone extension of the OUE building, the concept of the revolving restaurant, with separate & (fairly) private dining spaces, does impress. The floor to ceiling glass walls provided beautiful views of the Marina Bay, but the reflective surface unfortunately also gave us a view of the service staff behind us milling away preparing the food or congregating for some discussion (and the conversations were occasionally audible... so much for privacy). Sadly, it seems like the ambience is its only saving grace for the night other than the service recovery effort they offered (to be elaborated below). And it was not enough to save the night.We were served an appetizer of preserved radish. Much like any Chinese restaurant. Plated in a small plate - probably scooped from a large container without any afterthought. To me, the function of this appetizer is analgous to the amuse bouche in the usual fine dining restaurant, but the way it was presented (or lack of) and the quality of it baffles me. My friend's comment that it tastes like achar pretty much sums up the feeling at this point. However, there was marked improvement in the next two dishes.The starter of chilled Alaskan crab with watermelon radish and caviar was plated beautifully on a slate plate over dry ice. This was followed by braised sharks fin with winter melon paste and black truffle, which was rich in flavour and remained hot as it was served over a tealight. Excluding the dish they served for service recovery, this was probably the best dish of the night. It was downhill from then on. A steamed wild ocean fish with pickled chilli came rather cold, and with a fishiness that couldn't be masked by the chilli / soya sauce marinate. This was a point that I expected a good Cantonese restaurant to have dealt with easily. They then served a sorbet (I think it was lime... and it's a question mark because the manager / assistant manager who served it, just left it on the table without saying anything) as a palate cleanser before the next dish. The next dish - named as "Salt-grilled Kagoshima Wagyu Beef accompanied with foie gras" - turned out to be a disappointment and a blessing. 5 thinly sliced wagyu beef without any visible marbling served over some mushrooms and foie gras. Our waiter told us that we should eat the beef together with the foie gras which was hidden underneath. Problem - the foie gras was never there. After clarifying with the manager, he confessed that the chef "forgot" to include the foie gras. To me, this was a fatal mistake (and the mistake that compelled me to write this review) especially for a restaurant that markets itself as fine-dining, and having charged me more than 200 per person. Yes, I am disgruntled and I think I have the right to.To the credit of the manager, he was apologetic and immediately offered to make a new replacement. They even "upgraded" it to a larger portion of beef and foie gras, and used a much higher grade (A4) wagyu. This was the blessing, cause the beef literally melted in your mouth and went very well with rich flavours of the foie gras. Without doubt the best dish (and a million times better than the dry, scrawny pieces we were given initially), and demonstrated how the quality of the beef can influence the taste so dramatically. Yet it also felt like rubbing salt into the wound. It was a stark contrast to the inferior quality of the wagyu served initially. Why on earth was this not served in the first place? If you scrutinise their different menus, ranging from 80 / 120 / 180 and 250 / pax, you don't see this high grade wagyu beef anywhere. It was a valiant attempt at service recovery but with a fatal mistake like "forgetting" to plate a vital ingredient, it was never going to be successful. We then had the rice vermicelli in seafood broth and geoduck clam, pleasant but nothing to rave about. The ending was meant to be the highlight as the birthday boy was looking forward to the salted egg yolk chocolate lava cake. Sounds delectable and possibly a heavenly combination. Once again, extremely disappointed as the cake and its filling was barely warm. Probably left outside for some time. The restaurant, knowing that it's a birthday celebration did provide a complimentary dessert which was a nice gesture... but it was too little, too late. Overall, the service was adequate but inconsistent at times. For example, not every dish was explained to us when served (even when the manager / assistant manager was serving us). In line with the idea of private dining, they did their best not to be intrusive but as mentioned above, the reflective glass windows and audible chatter were still a distraction at times. To me, any restaurant, high end or not, should put the food as its highest priority. This restaurant failed to live up to my expectations, committed a fatal mistake in my opinion and represented very poor value for money. It would have received a terrible rating if not for the attempted service recovery

Oh my! At first we felt like we had chosen the wrong place. But after the food started coming we were amazed and delighted! It was a surprise and a sensation at each course. Such Imaginative cooking! Note: The restaurant rotates so everyone get a view of the entire city while at your table. They offer only fixed menus for at least two people, so if you are a group of three you will need to order the same menu choices. Which is probably a good idea anyway so that you're eating at the same pace. There is no background music and it's so calm & serene that we felt like we had been transported to new world. (Also, We couldn't see any other diners.

Arranged for my boss to host some overseas VIPs in a private room on a quiet Monday night. Some feedbacks were: Beer took a long time to be served even though it wasn't crowded; dirty hand towel that has turned from white to light grey-ish; the rotation mechanism which causes the restaurant to move seems to malfunction with momentary jerks at intervals....grrrr

I was not sure if it's worth the while having a meal at this restaurant. After all, the set meals are priced above most Chinese restaurants. But we decided to give a shot nonetheless.We picked the 6 course set meal at $80 per person. The appetizer was a letdown, it was just mere few pieces of salted vegetable plated nicely. The 1st course was some dim sum, which again was nothing to shout about. When the soup was served, I was blown away. The coloured of the soup did not seem appetizing to most, but the ingredients in the soup was what mattered. I have never tried nor heard about sea cucumber flower and was amazed at the exquisite taste of it. I fell in love with this soup. The steamed fish came next which was not bad. What I was not impressed with would be the steamed tofu. Thought it was rather ordinary. The 5th course to be served was another delight. It was millet fried with Chinese sausage and lobster. The taste was simply delicious and felt healthy. The final course was pumpkin purÃ©e with a scoop of coconut ice cream served in a small coconut. It was so intricately plated that it looked too good to be eaten. And the taste was better than great!Probably what the management can do is to train their young waiters and waitresses better. Especially in the delivery of what each dish is. Otherwise, I msut applaud to the good service rendered and the cosy seat reserved for us. And the view was amazing. So coupled with the good food, would I return? A definitive Yes! And this time for dinner:

I was amazed that this restaurant really trying to do Chinese food fine dining as it is in European style fine dining. The foods were offered in sets and all came in small portions but a lot bigger than the European sizes. The service was rather far from expected fine dining services. This restaurant also has a Japanese section (sic). However, the food quality was nice.

You barely feel it as you stand on the restaurant platform and gaze out into the black night to the ever-changing horizon of Singapore. From amusing sights like a neighbouring commercial building with a full floor of people performing pilates, an empty office reflecting the grey sheen of the eyes, Fullerton hotel with the whole of Marina Bay Sans accompanying its side and wonders you may barely notice if it weren't for those moments without food on your unusual stone plate placed before you. The plate is completely flat and circular is decorated with two black fish, appearing to swim for your entertainment as you await. The food had marvelous presentation, echoing the high-ambience that the restaurant provides. Although the responsiveness and lack-of-smiles catered by the staff could be a questionable part of quality services. The fusion food was of fair quality, although not of overwhelming graces. My personal favorite dish was the peking wrap. Followed by the cleansing pallete raspberry sorbet and mango-yam-in coconut dessert. The rest of the dishes were rather ordinary and some were strange. The strange one being the very first dish, the appetizer: poached and skinned tomato. It was sour and its texture mushy. This texture was similarly copied for the beef, which left me cringing in my seat. Nonetheless, despite it all, if you are looking for a place with ambience and conversational food, come to Tong Le

Atmosphere: 4/5Great seating arrangement, with partition separating diners from each other.Food: 4/5Food was fantastic, especially their seafood dishes. Wine selection was fabulous.Service: 3.5/5Only the manager seemed very happy and passionate to be serving everyone with smiles. The waiter and waitresses do not really smile (maybe they got scolded earlier?)Value: 4/5Overall it is definitely one of the best places to enjoy Chinese fine dining with a fantastic view.Important Things to Note:The full rotation requires about 2 hours.I highly recommend to get seats facing the building first when you start your dinner, so when your at your main course (approximately 1 hour to 1.5 hours later, you would be overlooking the entire harbor, esplanade, Fullerton area and MBS.We started at 7.30pm, which at about 8.30pm to 9.45pm, we are overlooking the entire harbor - MBS has a lights show at 9.00pm sharp (which we had perfect views).P.S We were very lucky to have fireworks that night

Came here for a business lunch. (1) Food. Set menu is a lot of food. Everything depends on whether you like the food since it is a set. Our first dish was the dian xin and they had the most amazing radish cake. For soup it was lamb belly which was really fatty and a lot of Chinese don't like lamb. The alternative was shark cartilage which a lot of people have issues with. There were no other choices. I really think this choice should have been improved. We changed the rice to black ink soup noodle which was interesting (except now there was two soups). Didn't like the desert at all. (2) Service. Senior waiter was good but the more junior waitress had no idea about what food she was serving. (3) ambience. Quite nice. Its a rotating restaurant.
4
Beautiful ambience!Good:- revolving restaurant that provides a really good view of the entire Marina Bay and CBD.- private dining set menu which takes the stress off ordering and you know what you are in for.Hit and miss menu items. Some dishes are really interesting with a modern take. Some dishes just don't quite work.Lunch menu ranges from $80 per pax to $250. You can see the menu on their website.Parking is confusing as there isn't actually a carpark at OUE tower. Park at OUE building and walk to the tower. It is right by One Fulllerton hotel and Customs House

Celebrated my mum's birthday at Tong Le. Attentive staff yet not intrusive, fine cooking and pleasant night view as the restaurant revolves. Lovely attention paid to mum, with longevity buns and a "tea set"
Well worth the experience

New Year's Eve countdown 7 course dinner was $450/person. Hubby and I wanted a good view of the fireworks without having to squeeze with the rest of the world.
Oh well, expensive but still worth it.

Beautiful gastronomic revolving restaurant with a breathtaking view on the Marina Bay Sands and the Fullerton by the Bay Hotel. Part of the restaurant is a Chinese and the other part is a Japanese. Excellent food and good service but expensive for Singapore.
4
Went here for my 3rd anniversary with my wife. Food is good, fine dining. From here u can see have a fine view of Singapore. Here is unique as the restaurant sit in a revolving plate, so the view is constantly change. If anyone wan to come for Chinese food, fine dining style, I would recommend here.
4
We were a big group and all had a wonderful time. The menu was advertised as Chinese but the presentation was Western, and attractive; portions were small. Service was efficient, and each course was preceded by an explanation and description. The pace of the 7-course meal was leisurely and we were there for over two hours, enough time for the revolving restaurant to go at least one round. The view of the Marina Bay would be quite a treat in the day. The ambience is ideal for a romantic outing, a business dinner, or just to have a convivial evening.The prefixed menu was, I feel, a tad expensive.Reservations a must
4
We went to try the only Private Fine Dinning Chinese Restaurant as advertise in town - Tong Le.It was a bit of a venture because of its usually a tourist spot which is high and revolving as a attraction.We were totally surprise with the greetings from the start and caring service, sommelier was helpful and only degustation was offer but it's great food with reasonable prices.Good dining experience.
5
Had the opportunity to see this beautiful place again while dining at Tong Le' , since the Resto is a revolving one, we saw the entire landscape and it never ceased to amaze me because it is indeed a beautiful sight. There are some additions to this picturesque landscape and they are just beautiful
5
First time to dine in this revolving Resto in Singapore, fabulous view specially the view of The Marina Bay Sands, we had the full view in all angle since we were revolving while dining. The place is very impressive! Our meal was specially prepared and ordered a few days ahead. We had an appetizer of red beets with truffle, crab and sharkskin . Wagyu beef with 3 sauces then sherbet. Main course was abalone wrapped in clay that was cooked for 6 hours, ( had to croaked it with a hammer) followed by a hot soup, poured right into the bowl. Dessert was a chocolate lava with rice crispies! Everything were delicious and mouth watering. I felt very special being served one meal at a time. Fabulous view, great meal and fantastic host

The location is amazing and the constantly changing view (it's a revolving restaurant) keeps you entertained with the sights in Singapore Marina Bay. However it was the food and service which really stood out. This set of private dining rooms is truly fine dining with a blend of Asian cuisine matched with some western style dishes. Each course was delicately prepared with a series of smaller sized servings that focused on perfectly matching the range of wines. The head Sommelier Vincent Tan is one of the most knowledgeable wine people in Singapore and the fine food is complimented by a very comprehensive wine list. If you are a group looking for a fine dining experience then my recommendation is to book ahead, choose a menu and even get some wines selected with Vincent's help to allow him to prepare them to perfection

The 1st thing that catches your attention is the very nice view of the Marina Bay area from 10 floors up. This is a more down to earth perspective than from the top of the Marina Bay Sands (e.g. at Ku De Ta). It's a revolving restaurant. Speed of movement is appropriate to dining. Roller coaster fans would be appropriately bored. HOWEVER, my compliments for the place stops here. The food is mediocre. This is not a good example of fine "Private Dining" of Chinese food available in Singapore. Tung Le is part of the Tung Lok group and you'll get better value for $ ordering similar items at other Tung Lok outlets. The service staff is are also just "ok". Nothing wrong with the service per se. Polite enough and attentive enough but no style or finesse that one would expect (ok, that _"I"_ would expect) from a place with this pricetag and calling itself "Private Dining". The tired looking waitress draged her feet while walking - and I don't mean in a figurative way. No suggestions as to the menu. Very Very brief clinical descriptions about what's being served.I would not go back.Specifies as to the dishes which we had - $180 menu. (Ref to attached photos)Wagyu and foie gras on rice. Issue is - The Wagyu is a "hamburg steak" - minced. Not a slice of meat. AND it isn't FAT enough - no oil dripping onto the rice (if you think that's good, we have different tastes). Similar complaint for the foie gras - somehow no fragrance of goose (or duck) fat at all. I would prefer the rice lightly burnt at the base layer (but ok, that's My taste). It wasn't at all.Dong-Po meat. One of the Leanest dong-po I've ever had. That said, it was nicely seasoned/soaked with Chinese Wine. (in case you're not familiar with Dong Po meat, it's supposed to be belly pork stewed with <secret> sauces). For me, if it is meant to be Belly Pork, it should be FATTY. This pig was clearly working out and went the whole hog.The caviar and lobster starter had some mango and sauce at the bottom of the serving cup. I am of the opinion that the flavours (which are good, I give them that) should be mixed instead of waiting till you get to scraping the bottom of the barrel to figuring it out. For a top notch "Private Dining" place, I would have expected the serving staff to say something along the lines of "...there is also a layer of mango and fruity molasses below and you might want to dig in to taste it together or mix it up before tasting." Nothing was mentioned. This is the primary example of what I meant above by the serving staff being mediocre. I would not go back again
