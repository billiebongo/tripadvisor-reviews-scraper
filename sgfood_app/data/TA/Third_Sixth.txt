Been here a couple of times and the standards have remained fairly consistent!
Service was great even though service charge is not levied.

Happy hours with one for one drinks till 9pm. House wine by glass is about $12.80. No service charge. There is smoking tables. Their burgers taste good. However the porky strip is quite weird as there is icing sugar on top.

Excessive use of salt and over 40 mins to get a burger with only 4 other patrons in the joint for dinner.
Terrible food and even worse service.

I came one evening and sat on my own at the bar. The burgers were great, well cooked and enjoyed the fries as well. The setting is very hipster in a cool way and the staff was friendly.

Came here without a reservation with 8 of us on a weekday night and it wasn't very crowded. Getting here is rather easy as the joint is just located within 5 mins of City Hall Mrt station.There are free arcade games, beer pong tables and table football in the bistro. The ambience is very laid back and the music choice had contributed to that as well.We all had the $20 dollar combo which gave us a Corona and a burger, which is a good deal given the location of the place.While waiting for the burgers we all had a go at the entertainment. The burgers and the sides we ordered came rather quickly, not only are the burgers well made, they are cooked to perfection as well.There were only two staff members that night but the food and drinks came out without a hitch.We had a great time!

after a week of business dinners and lunches, eating Thai, Chinese, Singaporean, Malaysian and Indian fare, on my last night I just wanted to eat alone, sit at a bar and have a burger and a beer. This place hits on all those cylinders.kind of a hipster vibe, but not pretentious like the San Francisco hipsters I'm used to :) the burgers are great, the beer selection was not extensive but entirely serviceable, and the waitstaff was friendly, but not trying to become bffs with you. I will be back in Singapore a lot and and already looking forward to sneaking away to have a burger here

Staying at the Naumi hotel next door and didn't want to wander far, so took a seat at the first place I found next door. Got served immediately and it was surprisingly one of the best burgers I've ever had. Messy but so delicious! Burger doesn't come with fries (tsk!), so ordered a serve of onion rings to go with it. They had a distinctive, herby taste and at first wasn't sure, but in the end loved them. Burger, onion rings and 2 beers $44 - but pretty good for SingaporeRecommend it

If I could, I would give it 3 and a half stars. I had the Messy Mexican, which was really a sloppy joe. The chili con carne was a bit on the salty side, but taken together with the patty and bun (which had sunflowers seeds, talk about being healthy!), was ok. Burger came with nice potato slices, and a few slices of tomatoes and lettuce. It was very filling, cost $16, and there is no service charge or gst. This is a bar kind of place that also happens to serve decent burgers. Servers are attractive young women, some heavily tattooed. Worth checking out if you're in the area for it's (somewhat) reasonable price and laid back atmosphere.

Despite the bar that I wanted to check out being closed I am still glad I wandered down this way because I wouldn't have found this place (and the Toy Museum) otherwise. Located on a street that runs behind Raffles hotel, this place is in complete contrast to the high end hotel that happens to be its neighbour. This place is really relaxed, quiet, and has a much better ambience, almost similar to what I would get from a hole in the wall bar in Melbourne. The staff were especially nice, and incredibly helpful. In fact it took a much shorter time for me to get my beer here that it did at Raffles (and then extra time for the bill to arrived). Here I had my drink and had paid for it before I could even blink. However, as I have mentioned, what gave this place its character were the wonderful staff
