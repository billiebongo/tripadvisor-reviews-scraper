Up to the mark which they serve around the world. Fresh breads nice staff. It's at the food court . Prices are the same which are in the city outlets.

As all Subways food it as fresh as it could be and you get value for money with no fat. We find the fresh Subs the best full of good salad.

One of the few places with vegetarian eating options - the staff is very friendly and the ingredients are always fresh. It is right next to the food court and therefore you also get a nice comfortable place to eat and enjoy your meal.

Hey you can't beat a good sandwich. I started taking my Subways on my next flight. Good for accepting foreign currency or credit cards

I love their fast service, although sometimes some breads are out of stock. I always find a table here at any time of the day.
Well worth taking the Skytrain from Terminal 1 to this Subway for a meal.

If you are like me and not too fond of airline food, I look for a snack to carry onboard , When I saw Subway I just had to grab a sandwich for the long flight. Subway provides freshly prepared sandwiches which are great value, and ideal for the flight

One of my children favorite sandwich. But the seller lady said I could not order there because the food is not halal. Eventhough I ordered tuna sandwich, they won't sell it to me. The reason was they use the same oven for ham or tuna sandwich. Good reason. I accepted that.

The food in this sandwich chain is always great; there is a wide variety of bread, toppings, meat and sauce. The staff were friendly and flexible; they were open to my request of having 2 3-inch sandwiches by splitting a 6-inch one. The chicken breast here is a must-have. In my opinion, it is the best meat you can eat there (but you need to pay extra for it)

Pleasantly surprised to see the breakfast meal of Subway. 3-in flatbread ham and egg sandwich with light lettuce and a slice of tomato. Seasoned with salt only and no sauce. Together with hash brown and a cup of coffee for only 4.50. Nice! Makes a 4:30am airport checkin not so bad experience. Delight is brought about by the design of the coffee cup. It has rugged edges to prevent slippage and potentially burning your hands with hot liquid. Good service, even early in the morning. This Subway branch is located at the 2nd floor of terminal 2, at the Straits Food Village which provides a nice local ambience.

Service was very slow. Plenty of staff. But did.not move very fast. Then went to McDonald's, which was actually worse.
Fast food in other Terminals is much more efficient.

This is a place which always seems to have a crowd. Its located at the basement near the arrival hall. Had to wait for a few minutes to find a place to sit. There is always a long que here. Vegetarians can also here.

Disappointing. Not your normal Subway standard.
It's 5.30am & the queue is 7 to 10 people deep & has been for the past 10 mins.
Once served I'm informed there's no hash browns due to no toaster.
Seems strange since they appear on the menu?

this is a boon if you are looking to grab a quick healthy bite or get a take away this one is just the right place ..

This Subway outlet serves the standard menu similar to its other outlets. Choices of sandwiches with good taste and good price too.

I don't usually write reviews about restaurants but would just want to praise their services under this circumstances. We came to Terminal 2 during our transit. We are bodybuilders so our options were limited. Subway was one of the few choices as we can choose what to be added. The staff and we had a lovely short chat. I have paid visits to a lot of different subways worldwide and this was the first time I had such an amazing conversation with their staff. They were amazed by our healthily-restricted diet. We were amazed by their dedication to their work

Sometimes when you are visiting abroad a familiar restaurant can make you feel right at home. Subway in Singapore is like that. They are all over the city. The bread is fresh, the ingredients are fresh, and the sandwiches are nicely made, the chips are crispy and the cookies are just like Grandma used to make. Plus you can get in and out quickly so you can get on with exploring the city

I recently ate lunch here while waiting for a flight. The food is fresh, the staff friendly and good reasonable prices. On a budget go here for a good size meal.

A clean eatery fresh bread salad crispy , drinks cold. People friendly. An exciting airport . Great rest rooms. Shopping endless such great service .

Teenagers are easily pleased with their favourite Subway sandwich before flying out. Attention here a regill is 1,2 S$ extra- for the normal food no extra charges are applied

Same as with other branches of Subway. Same menu, same efficient service. Same taste. It was ok for a quick bite. Nothing exciting but good for a quick breakfast if catching a flight.

Located upstairs in Terminal 2, Subway makes a nice change from McDonald's, especially for breakfast. Reasonable prices.

This Changi airport subway is good.The prices similar to other ones. The service is good.The sandwiches are tasty.

Located on the second floor next to food court. If you are looking for healthy fast food and you are also looking for a quick bite in T2 this is a good choice. Service is fast and efficient and unlike the Malaysian Subway they have bacon... Pork bacon .... Yummy and sinful

Upon landing back in Singapore, we had wanted to enjoy a nice meal of Subway. It was a terrible decision as we ended up being scolded by one of the staff for his own mistake and we left after purchasing our food feeling extremely maligned and unpleased.Said staff in question was a tall man whom had clearly no idea what Subway's service sequence was. From my past 10 years of experience with ordering Subway, the staff is supposed to ask what vegetables are to be placed inside the sub before actually putting anything in. Needless to say the man had skipped the step and started placing lettuce in before I even addressed the vegetables I want. I let it slip as we had ordered 2 subs at one go - both had lettuce and tomatoes.However, when I gently told him that I didn't want cucumbers in my second sub, he proceeded to take everything out of the sub perhaps as a display of his annoyance? Puzzled, we pointed out that we wanted tomatoes and lettuce, but not cucumbers. To my shock, he then told us off gruffly that next time, we have to "be clear or he would add everything in". I'm not even going to go into what was so horribly wrong with the second part of his statement - he then proceeded to add cucumbers into our sub anyway. Angered, we pointed that out and his response was that we were "blur". Really? This is the first time I have encountered such ridiculous service over cucumbers. It wasn't even about his mistake over the fact that he had been really rude to us. Oh well. I hope Subway takes the time to properly train their staff in the future

It is by far one of the most complete and convenient airport that i have ever passed by. Wide range of Food and Beverage Outlets, Retail outlets. There are even places for our legs to be massaged and adapters to charge my phones. Staff are generally friendly but need to improve on personalized service. Overall, Top 5 i ever experienced

Living in Singapore for many years it is getting harder and harder to find western food that actually taste like werstern food. Anything containing pork products seems to dissapear rapidly. Luckily the Subway here at Changi Airport Terminal 2 has it. And it tasted good - just the way I wanted it. Served by smiling staff....can highly recommend it for westerners (and locals alike) that fancy real meat on the nice warm bread and not a lookalike immitation ham that is served everywhere else..
