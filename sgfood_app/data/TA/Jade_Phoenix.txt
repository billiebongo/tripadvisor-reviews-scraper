Visited with friends during Chinese new year. Great dim sum and noodles. Excellent service. Best to book in advance if you a large party. Membership not needed to eat at this restaurant which is in the Singapore Swimming Club.

Went for a lunch with friends and was not amazed with their dishes. Just like normal fare and nothing impressive or deserve special mention.

Well done. Much improved in food quality and preparations. Service attention can be better. Pricing can be softer; too much for its standing.

This restaurant is located with Singapore Swimming Club. The food here is nice and has private room. They serve vegetarian dishes as well.

Surprise to find quality Chinese cuisine right inside the Singapore Swimming Club near to Fort Road. Ordered the 2pax set menu and almost every small dish is commendable. Very fresh and quality ingredients and the menu is surprisingly extensive! There is also an impressive list of vegetarian dishes! Service staff was prompt and attentive! The restaurant is situated on the 2nd floor.

Jade Phoenix is a relatively new restaurant at the singapore Swimming club and thus the "new" feeling is there in the decor. It has a reasonably extensive vegetarian menu - and the staff was willing to accommodate request for small changes. All the items we ordered (4 of them) were tasty... and the service was attentive. Desserts were excellent - mango with sago is definitely worth a try

The 7 course lunch consists of buns; roasted tea duck; double-boiled shark's cartilage soup with fish maw, dried scallops and bamboo piths; steamed giant marble goby; braised Chinese long cabbage with shredded mushrooms and dried shrimps; braised noodle with lobster; almond cream with glutinous rice ball.The buns are normal, duck skin is crispy but with tea smell, the soup is good, cabbage is soft and tasty, noodles is nicely braised and lobster is good and almond cream is well balance

The Chinese food served is very delicious and fresh.Some recommended dishes include the braised pork with bun,duck,fried cod fish and prawns.Service by staff was above average.The prices charged were comparable to similar class restaurants in Singapore.There is no service charge levied.Only drawback about this restaurant is that as it is located within the premises of Singapore Swimming Club,you need a club member to "invite" you for a meal at this restaurant.It is not open for the general public

Having the reunion dinner at Jade Phoenix in Singapore Swimming Club, Level 2. We have 8 courses dinner - loi-hei, shark bone soup, crispy duck, scallop, fish, jelly + red-bean cake, rice-ball and glutinous rice. Loi-hei is good mix of crackers + vegies. Shark bone soup is creamy and good taste. Duck skin is crispy and the meat goes with the plum sauce is very good. Fish is fresh and steam just nice. Scallop is salty might due to he dried meat added on it
