The best dishes were the salads on the menu. The tea leaves and penny worth salad were excellent combination of different vegetables and nuts. Thoroughly enjoyed the salad.
The main dishes were average. Nothing special.
I do not think we will be back.

You can taste authentic Myanmar cuisine in this restaurant. This restaurant always offers new dishes inspired by traditional Myanmar foods.

Nice friendly restaurant. Wide selection of Myanmese dishes. Majority of the dishes are spicy, even the vegetables and soup. For those who dare to take spicy food.

If you want to try the Burmese Food for the first time, Inle Myanmar will be the best for you.
I love the place which is more relax for having the food.
But the price is high compare to other restaurant.

Very flavourful food! Fast service and reasonable servings :). Nice ambience inside the restaurant!
I ordered the butter flavoured rice and pork curry. That Chilli thing that came with my food was a flavour bomb! I'm really pleased, I'm glad I went here. :)

Prices are pretty good for City Hall area, though they're expensive for Burmese food. Good variety of rice, noodle, protein and veg dishes. They have inexpensive sets which include an appetiser, main and soup.
No frills and just simple, hearty food.

We had never tried the Myanmar cuisine, but we have been encouraged by colleagues just coming back from this (not usual....) Country.Although being located in the Basement level of a business tower, not very attractive, INLE is known as one of the "highest level" Myanmar restaurant in Singapore.The menu clearly show the points of contact with Thai kitchen, but the use of different spices helps to identify the different origin; I have to highlight the tasteful fried catfish with dried spices. Prices reasonable. Main dislike is the lack of a toilet (it's not an hawker centre.....in a restaurant, this fact it is not acceptable), then ther closure hour (10 p.m.) which, for a central restaurant, is clearly too early

Singapore is not a cheap place to eat and drink so we were so glad we found this restaurant. As we were staying at the Excelsior over the road it was most convenient.The food was lovely with plenty of choice and service very good. Reasonably priced beer

My Myanmar colleague treated me to this lunch, saying that the original restaurant in Myanmar is well-known known for good food of consistent quality. I had Shan Khau Hswe. This was Shan sticky rice noodle with pickled vegetables and sesame seeds. The taste of the spices used was typical Burmese, something that would appeal to those with a preference towards the sweet side. There was a pleasing contrast in both colors and texture, with the dish made crunchy with some small peanuts, which seemed local to Myanmar. For dessert, I had Shew Yin Aye. This was essentially a Burmese kind of chendol. It featured coconut, agar agar, white bread and jelly served in chilled coconut milk. With the bread as an ingredient, it was an interesting variant of the dish so familiar to Singaporeans & Malaysians. My colleague had chicken curry, a less spicy version of what we are used to concocted with its own selection of Burmese spices. But the dish that I loved was the fried eel. Crispy, spicy and mixed with a variety of condiments, I felt that both taste and texture were perfect. I think this is a credible place to explore if you want to have authentic Burmese food in a setting better and quieter than the neighboring food court

We enjoyed our food!! Very good. Staff does not really understand/speak English I think- they did not seem to understand what we were saying... Anyways, coming back for sure!!! Loved that mango salad, and pork ribs!

This eating place is underground at Coleman Street, close to the Grand Park City Hall. Rustic and charming. Here you can test odd dishes (odd for Westeners), very good, and spices that might take your breath away. And beer brewed in Burma.

Tea leaf salad is the best item on the menu. Get it mixed. The seafood fried noodles was also good.
I find the Mohinga just so-so. Shan noodles was a better option.

Good enough to try out the local cuisine, but would not recommend it for a couple set at SGD75.While the food was sufficient to fill your tummies, I expect a bit more on restaurant ambiance and service standards.Nevertheless it seems that plastic cups and plates are acceptable.The food was ok-ish, wouldn't be back again soon

I came to this place twice and I plan to come back more! My Burmese friend brought me here and she has vouched for the authenticity of the food. On my first visit, I tried the all day set meal ($14.90 excl tax) it came with a tea leave salad, milk tea and a noodle soup dish called <Mohinga>. That was my first time trying Burmese food and I loved it! The broth of the soup was rich and I could taste the chicken in it. The <tea leave salad> had a crunchy texture because of all the assorted nuts and vegetables in it. All my friends loved it. The milk tea was very rich, as they use evaporated milk. It isn't as sweet as the ones we have in Singapore, where they use more condensed milk. On my second visit I had <citrus salad> which came with my meal. It was so good, because I love citrus and this was made with lime, along with some nuts and vegetables. It is refreshing, try it! I also had <Zhar zan hing ha>. I enjoyed it. My Burmese friend had <shan tofu> and she savoured every bit of it. Approved! Portions are big and very filling. Service was prompt and very quick. The moment we got seated, they brought us water and the menu. Staff were very attentive. They are mostly Myanmar nationals, but they understand English. I'm happy to pay the 10% service charge because they well deserve it. The price is fine, for a foreign cuisine. If you're on a budget, order the ala carte which comes with salad. I think it is value for money. Recommended!

I've wondered about this underground eatery for years, but just recently stopped in. I wish I had not waited for so long. The mixed tea leaf salad was excellent, and the curry was brilliant. The assorted fritters did not add much flavor, but the quality of everything else surpassed any expectations. You will not regret a visit to this wonderful place

This cheerful but unassuming restaurant in the basement of a small shopping center offers delicious tastes of Myanmar. The flavors are clear and bright with perfectly adjusted seasoning. A group of friends went and we thought the standout dishes were the spicy prawns, the tea leaf salad and a seafood noodle dish. All of us have actually travelled to Burma and thought that the food, while absolutely authentic, was better than anything we ate there. The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful. If you are deciding between dishes they can explain what they think will go with what else you've ordered and also caution you against ordering things that are too similar. Love this place! For four of us, dinner including beer came to about $60 USD

I used to stop by this restaurant at least bimonthly because of tasteful dishes. Variety of choices of traditional Myanmar foods and desserts out there with reasonable price, and comes with free ice water. You may feel as if you're at Inle lake (2nd largest lake of Myanmar) because of decoration. Here are some exclusive Myanmar foods- Mohinga (thin rice noodle with fish soup), Shwe Taung noodle (noodle with coconut milk curry), Shan noodle (sticky noodle with cooked pork with fermented beans), Nan Gyi Thote (thick rice noodle dry salad), Pone-Yay-Gyi Pork (Pork with black bean sauce), Shwe-Yin-A (sweet dessert with sago, bread, coconut milk, jelly cake), Fa-lu-da (Rose syrup with icecream). Above average service with not long waiting time.

Stumbled across this place and glad we did. Delicious food and excellent value (as opposed to many other places in Singapore). We paid S$34 for 3 mains, 1 coke and a desert. Staff friendly and welcomed kids. The basil chicken was so good for $8. There's an extensive dessert menu, our kids enjoyed their Burmese treat. Clean and fresh food. Highly recommend.

I've never been to this exotic country. But, once you go to peninsula plaza, then you'll feel as if you are in Myanmar.I tried Inle out of curiousity. Wondering whether the food is similar like thai foods.Surprisingly, i found that Myanmar cuisine is a mix between thai, chinese and indian food. The combination makes it interestingly delicious.I tried their chicken biryani. Different with the original indian style, they put fried garlic and shrimp inside the rice. One more thing, they use normal rice rather than bashmati. The combination is very nice and more like nasi goreng ( malay fried rice). As for the chicken, it is tender, and quite tasty.I tried their chicken curry which has a mild curry taste ( i feel it is more like chinese indonesian curry style) and salted bean pork ( more to chinese style). Every food they served and the service is very good. One more thing, they also serve ice water fir free
