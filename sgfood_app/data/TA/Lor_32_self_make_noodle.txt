Always long queue but the food is good. Love the mee hoon kuey. One of the best around. Prefer the dry version and the chili is well made too.

More suited on cooler evenings.

Business is good. Expect long queue. Noodle is fresh and soup is nice. Chilli is shiok too. (Shiok = exciting). Frequent visit here whenever close by. My personal favorite is the fish and shrimp combo.

Be prepared to wait 40min or more for a bowl if you come at peak mealtimes, especially weekends. I haven't tried a tastier bowl of ban mian anywhere else. Soup version is very comforting while dry version is very tasty. Highly recommend if you're in the area!Only downside is the griminess of the tables. Place is closed on Mondays

You will wait, but it is worth it. The hand made noodles here are pretty fantastic. You can order the noodles in a soup (Ban Mian) or dry. You can also choose from a variety of meats or fish to go with it. I choose the dry, pork noodles and asked for the egg yolk to be mixed into the noodles. The soup then comes as a side dish, which is tasty on its own. The dry noodle dish is similar to the Chilli Pan Mee style of noodles as once the egg and sauce are mixed with the noodles, they have a nice rich texture over them, which adds to the flavour. The noodles themselves are a little thick and chewy, which is how I like it, as they soak up the sauce. The sauce itself, when mixed with the chilli is delicious as it has a nice soy sauce flavour, but is also spicy. All in all, this is a great place for noodles, but you have been warned about the wait, which is usually around 20mins plus plus..

Heard so much about this Ban Mian located in a coffee shop at Lorong 32. Finally came to try. It is really good. The boss made his own dough and offers 3 types of varieties namely You Mian (thin noodles), Ban Mian (flat ones like mee pok) and Mee Hoon Kueh (the irregular shapes). I really like the texture of the mee hoon kueh. You can have the choice of dry or soup. Both are good in their own ways. The prices are attractive too. I ordered the soup with mee hoon kueh that has 3 fresh prawns along with it. The prawns were cooked just right n were succulent and fresh.Will definitely back again although is crowded with waiting time approximately 20mins

1st time here ⛰. Very good indeed. The noodles were nicely al dente without the "doughy" taste. Soup stock was balanced. The dry version was even served with an egg (蛋花) soup. Prawns were super fresh & sweet. Will definitely be back. be prepared to wait 15-30 min
