I recommend the frog-dish which seemed to be a local speciality. Actually they serve all dishes at a very reasonable price.

Ordered the lemon chicken for lunch. The lemon sauce is not bad. But the skin is so thick fatty with lot of flour. Not sure if I want to come back to try other menu.

Came across this place by accident whilst wandering about as it's away from main shopping areas. Ate there a twice during our 5 day stay in Singapore. The interior is modern, fresh, bright and clean and I was especially impressed that the kitchen was visible and the hygiene was of a high standard.Thourghly enjoyed the traditional Singaporean fare whilst sitting at a table outside chatting some of the local guys who regularly meet up there.The price of the food and Tiger beer is very reasonable. Great value and atmospher

This is a go to place when looking for authentic inexpensive Chinese cuisine.There's chili crab, steamed grouper, sweet and sour pork, fried rice, hor fun noodles, scallops in brocolli flower, sharks fin soup, chicken dishes and many more. (Ok, the Sharks fin soup is a bit expensive; but all others should be alright with the budget-conscious.)Try it once, and you may end up coming back.
