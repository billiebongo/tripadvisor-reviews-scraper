Mitsuya have few sets of pricing tier.
each dishes serve was fresh and chef explain what we are having. however for the price, the items could be better.

Amazing sushi and fantastic service. The Head Chef Harada is very friendly and extremely creative with the fish he gets from Tsukiji. I recommend going for the Omakase menu for a truly authentic Japanese sushi meal.
5
Fish was fresh & seasonal. Tastefully prepared by the head Japanese chef. Quality comparable to the standard at Shinji, Hashida Sushi & Shiraishi. Will be back for another visit.

Wonderful food in genuine sushi restaurant close to the centre of the banking district of Singapore.

My wife and I had dinner here, recommended by a friend.Classic decor, wonderful service. Everything very fresh and beautifully served. Had the most expensive Omakase menu and a lovely sake. Not cheap but well worth it. Will go back and would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant. First class!

Celebrating wedding anniversary and decided to take advice from TA and decided to give this place a go even though they been in business for over 4 yrs. We seldom venture out for dining in Singapore as we prefer to eat from the original food supply source if we want good dining options. Made reservation for weekday lunch the day earlier and manage to get a counter seat (only 10 customers at counter and another 8 in private room).Ordered the $200 lunch offering but was left disappointed and hungry. Had to move to another joint for ramen later.I told the Asst Chef (Sean) that I was still hungry and he offered to give me an extra piece of sushi which I decline. Sean was a nice guy answering most questions truthfully, like the type of aged rice from Kumamoto, Russian Uni short thorn (though pack in Hokkaido - if u buy at bulk from Tsukiji market and ask the vendor the source of supply, they would tell u if it was from China, Korea, Russia or Japan) etc.The only saving grace is that the fish variety offering are more unique than the usual sushi joints and their rice portion was perfect.At this price point for lunch, I would highly recommend Hachi at Mohammed Sultan though offering maybe a slight difference but ambience, service, food quality, presentation and value much better.I can't imagine those having the less expensive lunch sets, what they having as their mains after lunch?Too many choices out there for me to make a repeat visit (young Japanese Head Chef cum owner has a grumpy appearance and was told he is always like that)

We chanced upon this place during lunch and wasn't expecting anything special as we have never heard of this place. But, we were proven wrong as the sushi here is awesome!!! We sat at the chef's table and could see the food preparation in front of us. The fish was very fresh, excellent quality and we enjoyed the whole dining experience. Would definitely recommend this place sushi lovers
5
This isn't one of those serious and meditative sushi restaurants. The chefs carry out their work with verve and there is a positive energy about the place. There was intelligent conversation about the fish, the other ingredients and their origins. We had a biggest omakase meal and it seemed to go on for a long time. Servings were generous and I felt full halfway into the meal but as it was a birthday treat, I could not simply stop eating! The chef gave me a generous serving of toro and even made me a sushi birthday cake
5
Probably one of the better and authentic sushi places in Singapore. The price is higher than many other restaurants but hey, you're paying for quality and delicious food! Service was really good too. It's my second visit but definitely won't be the last. Keep up the great work

The place was simple in decoration, with a small menu with 4 items at the door. Inside the first one saw was the counter seats with a couple of private rooms on the right. All the customers were sit at the counter, each chef serving about 2 to 3 customers. I decided on Mizukagami 水鏡 lunch set (S$100++) as it had both raw and cooked items in it.AppetiserTsubugai - soya sauce boiled sea whelk. Not too salty and kind of chewy.Assorted sashimi, served with seven years aged soya sauce. White fish Hotate - scallop topped with black charcoal salt and yuzu zest, refreshing tasteAkami zuke - soya marinated tunaFish topped with grounded ginger and spring onionHotaru ika - firefly squid, seasonal spring item, inside was very creamy and delicate.Cooked DishRainbow trout fish wrapped with sakura leaf, topped with sakura flower. The flower actually tasted not bad. The fish was very smooth.5 piece Sushi MedleyKinmedai - snapperTako - octopus, surprisingly smoother than what I usually had. Chūtoro (中とろ) which was medium fatty tunaBafun Uni - rich and buttery texture of the sea urchinAnago oshisushi - unagi served in osaka style with marinated rice, it was kind of blandMini Don Finely minced fatty tuna with salmon roe, on top of sushi rice. Served with 7 years aged soya sauce. Super tiny serving. Simply melt in the mouth.SoupSuimono. Clear seaweed soup served with a chewy piece of mochi. Refreshing smoothing in the tummy.DessertGreen tea jelly, topped with red bean. The jelly was chewy with slight green tea taste. It was served with Sakura sorbet which was milky with a slight floral taste.Service was not bad. Tea was refilled regularly. The japanese chef serving me explained each dish he served but half the time I could not understand him. Sometimes the staff serving tea would help to explain too

Perfect setting, service and menu. A pleasure to enjoy the sweet uni from Hokkaido in Singapore. Great experience for anyone seeking true Japanese food. The picturesque quarter add to the pleasure. We will definitely go back!

Came back here today for another visit and opted for the chirashi lunch set. This consisted of a chirashi bowl and a selection of smaller dishes served in sequence. Efficient service throughout and very tasty and fresh fish. Worth returning for another visit.
5
Was there for lunch today.
The ambience was great especially the private room.
Good selection of sake.
And the Chef selection was most scrumptious.
5
It was a truly bespoke dining experience and every piece of sushi was a delicacy put into our mouths. Loved the sea urchin sushi! One of the most authentic Japanese dining places in Singapore!

Mitsuya is so under rated. While Shinji at Raffles Hotel is considered the best in Singapore, I find it too formal but quality and traditional jap sushi. Mitsuya, under Chef Harada-San, brings certain creativity to sushi, often surprising you with some combinations! Not to mention he can speak Cantonese (picked up during his stint in HK-Sushi Hiro). The staff and chef constantly makes you feel like home with informal laughs and jokes. However, he will professionally leave you alone when you are hosting a business lunch/dinner.The omakase meal will not disappoint with quality sushi. I often request for my "3-color" rice bowl which Chef will prepare with Baby Shrimp+Chopped Tuna+Uni. It's heavenly! Once, I went into the restaurant at 930pm (they finishing last order) just to have a small bowl!Sometimes, they have uni-night or tuna-night where an entire blue-fin tuna is dissected in front of you. And the best part, you get to taste different parts that you won't get at other restaurants.For those that prefer a lighter atmosphere but quality sushi, try to get a table in front of Chef Harada

Chef Harada of Sushi Mitsuya is the consummate chef patron. Every diner is warmly welcomed & it is a joy to return each time. Put yourself in Harada-san's hands & you are guaranteed a superb dining experience. I usually opt for the Omakase menu & have never been disappointed. Course after exquisite course of the best Japanese food you'll ever eat. In my opinion right up there with Sushi Ichi Ginza and Shinji, if not better. Go treat yourself.

Sushi Mitsuya is a must visit for seafood lovers.Chef Harada has lots of pride to serve only the best of the best of seafood imported from Japan. Incredible produce! Very good service & Chef Harada being the main attraction. Incredible skills! Watching Chef preparing the food is amazing! Had a scallop sushi - it was to die for. Will never forget! Scallop, black salt, yuzu - on rice. A mind blowing treat.

Been to Sushi Mitsuya several times for dinner but today is the first time I've had lunch there. Took the $180++ set. It was worth it.Baby squids were out of this world. Toro was very good too. Everything was good if not very good but uni was not the best. Sometimes they have Number 1 uni which is really great
4
Located in the hip Tras street, Sushi Mistuya is one of the few High end Sushi restaurant.Chef Harada cooking and ingredients are a bit different from classic Japanese restaurants you can find in Singapore. The texture of the Sushi rice is also something different, some may not like it.The lunch omakase is a good value.The service could be a bit more friendly

I know it is place renowned for supreme quality and rewarded for excellence in every way. However, it is not place for everyone. Someone like me, used to "westernized" version of Japanese kitchen appreciates the variety of exotic ingredients, the precision of the cut, the beauty of the entire setting... but I actually didn't like the food. I found it bland. Maybe I faced too many strange textures, unknown type of sea creatures, but to be frank it out me off Japanese kitchen for a while. The price is fairly steep as well, almost 400$ for the mid-price Umi and two beers, l can say it was interesting experience but not "my cup of tea". In other words, consider your own degree of bravery when booking, there are no small dishes here to try and quickly find out it's time to go somewhere else. Service was very prompt and kind, but all these dishes were served too fast. I think we've had 6-7 dishes served within one hour
5
Sushi Mitsuya serves authentic Japanese cuisine at top level! Produce are top notch - Chef Mitsuya is an artist / craftsman on its own.
Service is top level and ambience is like back home on Japan.
Will be back.

We had the most expensive Omakase set but the food was not spectacular. For the price you pay, you are better off eating at Shinji at Raffles Hotel.
5
Fresh fish, authentic Japanese processing. I love the tempura cod fish, inside it's Super creamy and just like liquid. We had the middle level receipt and it is very satisfying. Next time may try the best one to expect some surprise. Good place to visit and saves your choice.

Chef Harada is behind this fantastic restaurant. I have been here several times and it is a great place for a business lunch or dinner. Leave it to him to serve up delectable portions of his masterful creations. Everyone that I bring here for the first time leaves as a customer booking their next visit soon after.
5
I have eaten at Sushi Mitsuya for at least 10 times over the period of 2 years and I must say the sushi is consistent. The owner and head Sushi artist, Ryosuke Harada San is a artist at preparing fresh sushi and a very friendly person who caters to whatever is requested. I've been to many Japanese sushi bar's in Singapore and Sushi Mitsuya is as close as you will get to feeling like you are eating at a very good sushi restaurant in Japan.
5
Visited for lunch. 4 menu choices to keep it simple. We ate the chirabashi and the set sushi menu. It was wonderful to see the chefs at work. Fish was extremely fresh and sushi was wonderfully prepared. The set lunch was very good value for the variety, quality and overall experience
5
One of the best place to enjoy Edomae style sushi in Singapore. Chef explains throrughly about the sushi (it's almost like a sushi lesson!) with his fluent English and it's so much fun. He will never make you bored even if you visit alone. HIghly recommended for Sushi lover
5
The food is perfect, the service was really friendly, every one of the staff said hello and goodbye and our waitress was attentive and took the time to explain the menu. Food was fresh and the flavours, although initially sounding a bit odd, worked really well together
5
Even though it is known as sushi restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of cooked food that was available. The counter seating was full for our visit, which helped boost the atmosphere.Service from the chef was amazing, he can communicate in Cantonese and was very hilarious.Value was great, something unexpected. I was actually full. Definitely will revisit
5
One of the best Sushi places I have ever visited. Granted, it is very expensive, but it was an experience worth having. The dishes were extremely delicious and even things which I would normally not enjoy (uni and unagi), were so well done that I throughly enjoyed. Staff are very well trained and service was great - very attentive. Highly recommend.

Japanese Chefs, fresh ingredients, good service, expensive, not cozy, easy to walk in without reservation. It is better than many sushi places in Singapore yet I have mix feelings about this restaurant.
5
A classic and yet traditional sushi restaurant tucked in the humble lane of Tras Street. Website suggested to park at Orchard hotel and take a small walk (about 5 minutes) to the restaurant.Ambience is very bright, comfortable, not over crowded and just like a good sushi restaurant that you can find in Japan. We have our personal sushi chef, Sato with us that evening.Great personal experience with the food prepared right in front of you. And it is absolutely beautiful to see and dancing with joy in our palates. Sake selection is good too. We were offered to try it in 2 different shapes of sake glass to appreciate it in different way. Great stuffs.oh, did I mentioned that the service is impeccable too?A make-you-want-to-come-back-again restaurant for sure

Came here for lunch today with a colleague and opted for the Chirashi set at $50++. This comes with a couple of small appetisers, a miso soup and dessert. Pretty happy with the quality of the sushi and the presentation. Service staff are a little amateur but intentions are good. It's only a small place so reservations are essential
5
If you LOVE good n' proper, use-your-hands, pristine-flavoured, lovingly prepared sushi and can't get yourself to Japan, Sushi Mitsuya's your next best bet. The food and experience here is authentic, refined and basic in the true-blue Japanese sense: perfection in simplicity. The space is bright and spacious enough so you can see the chefs work like the maestros they are. Every morsel is beautifully put together with careful consideration for balanced flavours and textures, centring on super fresh and excellent ingredients. The menu starts with clean flavoured sashimi and moves towards more complex and bolder sushi and cooked dishes. I lost track of the number of dishes I had, but I loved EVERYTHING I ate, ranging from favourites like mackerel, tuna and otoro (rolled around a luscious dollop of egg yolk and miso emulsion, omg I could have eaten 10 of those!) to specials like tuna tendon, heart clams and sea eel. I'm not usually a fan of uni, having had varying experiences even in notable restaurants â€“ but Chef Harada-san's red and white uni dishes were so sublime, I don't think I can have uni anywhere else. Dessert was simple but very welcome by the end of the amazing meal: peach sorbet, almond panna cotta and sweet melon. We went full hog for the $300 omakase menu and it was totally worth it for its authentic freshness, quality and genius pairing of flavours and textures

Is another authentic sushi restaurant. Very authentic yet you wont feel stressed dining in that kind of the ambience. Everyone is friendly even though 1 or 2 of them look abit serious...hehehe. Nonetheless, must try the in-house special Tamago. Alcohol drinks are abit pricey caompare to others Japanese restaurant. Try to make a reservation before going down. Parking may be a problem, suggest to park your car at Orchid Hotel

Came with friends. We had amazing dinner set. Lost count of how many sushi and sashimi platters we had. Service is top notch. Good ambience which was optimal for good catch up. Not a romantic restaurant but good for business and catch up meals.Our dinner set has the following:uni/sea urchin, tuna, cod, fresh crab meat with roe, fresh wasabi, assorted vegetables.

My wife loves sushi so based on the reviews this looked like the right place to eat it. I have no doubt it is, but it is clear that this restaurant is in a league above mine. The staff were amazing, the decor stark, the air conditioning freezing and the lighting bright enough to perform a medical operation (which is pretty much what the chefs were doing)!We went for the mid range menu, and I could appreciate the freshness and work that had gone into it, but I have to admit it didn't add up to justify the price for me - I realise that this makes me the sushi philistine and I am comfortable with that, but I don't feel any urge to return
5
This is a great restaurant for business. First, ambience is great, not noisy at all, you can easily talk softly and be heard :-) Second, it is great fun to watch chef Harada handling his knife to make the sushis. Third, when we go out for business lunch to "regular" sushi places, we always order some of each type, then you get to that situation where no one wants to get the last one, so this prevents that from happening.Apart from that, I enjoy going to a restaurant that is not in a mall (rare in Singapore), price is adequate to the quality - everything is flown from Japan. Highlight the wasabi, grated on the spot, it tastes so much better.And for last, everyone treats you very nicely! Can't go wrong

First time taking a counter seat in a sushi restaurant. I love to observe how the chef work to prepare our meal. Service was great and the food was excellent. Harada san is also very thoughtful when he dished out the sushi. He had cut some sushi into half so that it's easier for ladies to eat. Thank you

Sushi Mitsuya only has counter seating & a limited number at that. There is a private room but really all the action is at the counter where Head Chef Ryosuke Harada's winning tableside manner will bowl you over. But what will keep you coming back is the freshest of the fish. I had dinner on a Sunday evening & opted for the Shoju set. This comprised a seasonal appetiser, 5 kinds of sashimi (the clam ones were the best), assorted cooked dishes, sushi, miso soup (chef replaced this with a clear broth with mushrooms & a prawn ball) & dessert. The presentation was beautiful & you soon sink into a comfort level that is unrivaled. Definitely one of the best in town with excellent service to boot. Weekday lunch is almost always booked as are some weeknight dinners. I would certainly return & the list of sakes is exceptional
