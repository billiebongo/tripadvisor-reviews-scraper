Just a typical bar. Not a huge choice of beers and the atmosphere was pretty standard for what you get. Nothing out of the ordinary.

We ordered a bottle of wine and it's quite affordable. The service was great. New Harbour cafe & bar has very nice roasted pork (very crispy and delicious, it's a must try!)

I have eaten at this place a number of times.
The crispy pork dish is very good and is accompanied with a good hot sambas.
The grilled mussels with garlic butter is also a very tasty option.
I will return again.

There is absolutely no complains about the food. Been here at least once a month for a few years now and standards are still the same. Roast pork can feed 2-3 pax and Mah Mee can serve as a main course. Wash it down with Guinness

Six of us had lunch here at patio table. Service was fine and adequate. We ordered various dishes and everyone was pleased with what they got. Nothing spectacular but decent cafÃƒÂ© foods. They had good beer selections, albeit way to expensive. After spending a few days in city we quickly realized that these prices are the norm, takes lots of getting used to for us westerners!! Lots of choices in area so check around for what suits you

We went there for after office hour drinks. Tried their Archipelago PTA and Irish (darker). Both were good as they specialize in these. Server directly from house tap. I also tried their Guiness Stouts as all their servers wear in Guiness black T-shirt. Turn out the drink was superb taste. Highly concentrated and fluffy

My first time to this restaurant as was strongly recommended by my bestie that their food were great! We had ordered roasted pork belly, love their chili, roasted pork chop, black pepper chicken, sirloin steak, fried mamee. We also ordered their soup of the day: crabmeat fishmaw. Was great! Must try! Was succulent I was surprised that plain water was charged.

food are very delicious but damages can be slightly higher than some other similar cafe and bar. they do have happy hour for some beers but quite a few choices though! no smoking in the cafe premises but available outside the cafe. it is about 10 minutes walk from after exiting Tanjong Pagar mrt exit-A

Just been here few days ago..... The environment was good but service was just average. We ordered Roast Pork & Sirloin Steak but the steak was totally a mess.....
It was really disappointed.

Nice pub, good range of beers. Not cheap but typical Singapore prices. went there twice as it was near where I was staying.

Food and drinks are good, but the service is another story. We ordered hot green tea which came in a small cup with saucer. I requested a refill from one of the standing-around waitress after finishing the teeny weeny little cup. Because the cup is small and the tea is concentrated, I'd like another cup of hot water. But the request was declined by the grouchy lady and also the bartender whom I asked separately. "We only refill hot water once." What??? It's just hot water and the servers aren't busy at the moment. You've lost this entire table of customers forever

I have visited the place for a few times now, after a recommendation by a good friend. I frequent the bar side more than the restaurant side, as I found the servers there more personable. I enjoy Kilkenny on draft which goes superbly with their bar food like the Hainanese roasted pork and my favourite white clams cooked in beer stock. I've seen conflicting reviews of the place but so far, I have been satisfied with their service and food

I went there with a colleague visiti g our Singpore office and the dishes of the day were fish & chips or beef pie! Same offering that we get on friday in the english pub close to our London office. The quality is very good, prive very affordable, waiters wonderful and the location is nice.It is indeed a group of different spots all grouped under one umbrella. Will surely come back
5
I have been here couple of times. I like the food here especially the hainanese roast pork, clams in beer stock, root beer, hainanese pork chop rice and many imported beers. It's located near to tg pagar mrt at duxton road. The only thing I don't like is the service which I think is getting worst. The food and beer is good for sure.

Ordered the NZ sirloin steak...medium rare...if I were the steak..I would have felt insulted and rudely seasoned...because a steak should be a steak..succulent,juicy and true to its beefy taste. .and yet I am (the steak talking)is being immensely rubbed and heavily seasoned in salt..with no herbs or spice to speak of...and swamped in a pool of tasteless over done onion sea of salt sauce...! Wah! I felt (the steak talking) I had induced hypertension to the eater of the steak! The only redeeming factor here is actually the $1.20 bottled water that quenched my eater's thirst!Hannibal Lector wld have eaten the chef instead for causing rudeness to the steak!lol.

After flight delay we checked in at our hotel later than expected and were looking for a quick and simple dinner at one of the nearby restaurants in walking distance. Some of the neighbor restaurants were full so we finally decided to have some snacks here. The food was average and so was the service. DonÃ‚Â´t expect too much but for drinks or simple meals this is a decent place

This bar cum restaurant is always busy especially lunch and dinner time. They do serve beer in the daytime and finger food besides the set lunch menu.The most popular dish is always the roasted hainanese pork and grilled fish. The grilled fish is only served at night and goes well with the beer. Good place to hang out as its also located near to many other bars.There is a bus stop that is right in front of the restaurant. The train station is located quite a distance away from the bar

My girlfriends and I first dined in on a Friday night in August. I ordered the Spaghetti Alfredo, which was fragrant and tasty, and probably so far the best Alfredo I've ever had. What I loved most was the Fish and Chips that my friend ordered. The deep-fried breaded crumbs which coated the fish were crispy and the fish was served fresh and hot. We ordered a variety of their mild-flavoured draft beers which we enjoyed very much. Overall, it is a very nice chill-out place

Service standard is volatile. Sometimes it is good. Sometimes it is bad. Perhaps, you have to depend on your luck.
For the food, it is a mix of Hainanese style food with Western garbs.
Though the drinks were excellent. Archipelago beers is on draft.

Happen to drop by this place for a drink. Ordered my favorite Kilkenny, unfortunately the drink tasted very diluted. I was not even able to finish the drink. So if you are dropping this place. Don't order the Kilkenny draft. I am sure they have other better drinks.

Been to this cafe bar several times and it have never fail me in terms of food and service. Not only they served western food well, they served good local food as well but with a little flavoured. I'm always at the bar side (they do have a cafe side which is more like sit down dining) as it's like having food and drinks with a one whole big family. Everyone seem to know one another and even if you there alone, you will get hooked up with conversation in the next minute. The owner (Francis) is super friendly. They served super killer good Guiness Draft and till today, they are one of the few in Singapore that seved good Guiness with the right temperature. Additions, they do carry many types of imported beers, wines etc. Suggested finger food to go with your drinks and to anme a few would be Roast Pork, Lamb Masala, Fried Mamee (egg noodle), clams with beer stocks etc. Tried their bitter beans with killer chiili paste and cripsy anchovies (only seasonal), it goes very well with beers. I would strongly recommend you to make a trip there and have a go for it. Service wise was just average but what do you expect when you are apying for cafe price but getting superb 5 star hotels quality food. Reviews is subjective but you will never know if you are not there yourself to try it

Despite good food, the impolite waitress spoiled our lunch. Waitress dismissed our request of switching on the fan and gave us crap excusses. Me: Can you please switch on the fan as we feel hot?Waitress: All the aircons are switched on, we cannot switch on the fan(note: The main door is wide open and hot air gushed in every now and then)Me: Yes. But we feel hot. Can you please switch on the fan?Waitress: No, fan will blow away the air from aircond(What!! seriously? The door is wide open and it is not even a concern??)Me: Is there a policy when aircond on and fan cannot be switched on?Waitress: Yes, instruction from our bossMe: May I speak with your boss?Waitress: No, he is not around. He is on the way to.Me: He will reach half an hour? one hour?By then we would have finished our lunch. May I have his number so that I can call him?Waitress: No, we are not allowed to give his number out.Me: So, can you please call him and I talk to him over the phone?Waitress: No, we cannot do that.No apology, and very very bad service. I will not go to that place again

Water is essential and vital for everyone. It is the basic necessity. Cafe and bars usually serve free water. However, The New Harbour Cafe & Bar does not serve free water to their customers considering the pricing standards of their food and drinks. If a customer who is really dying of thirst has to buy a bottle of water. We also notice some customers having their meals without any drink at all. The question we have to ask ourselves: What if a customer chokes and dies? The waiters/waitresses cannot possibly bring beer to the casualty. His/her family members have the rights to sue the cafe thereafter. Small issue of not serving free water to customers can lead to more phenomenal problems for the restaurant owner. Shows how cheap and stingy a human can be. Water should be provided free for everyone who patronizes restaurants and eateries. What comes around goes around

A well kept bar with great bar food. Burgers are second to none... and its all I ever wanted when I went here. Keep it simple. Great Little bar with a lot of soul. Boss always used to play rock n roll too. Handy sanctuary when you wanna forget your in the City

My colleagues and I decided to visit this cafe for a farewell lunch after hearing relatively good reviews from our staff and let me be clear it is one of the WORST decision ever. What started out as a happy gathering turn out to be a disaster when we inform the waiter about the white crawling insects which looks like maggots in the ketchup sauce that we used. Instead of apologising to us, the waiter came back with a bowl of tomato sauce, claiming that there were no flies or insects in it. She even have the audacity to question us and tell us that we should have inform them while we were eating. This form of service is totally unacceptable for a cafe or bar. There was ABSOLUTELY no apology or remorse from any of the staff in the cafe. Instead, the waiter even talk to us in a sacarstic tone saying, " THANK YOU for informing us ". I mean seriously, why are we even paying service charge for this kind of service. Depite the nice ambience and relatively good food, I would STRONGLY DISCOURAGE anyone from visiting this cafe. Why should customers pay to get such poor service and risk eating food that will pose danger to our health and safety

the food is nice, but the svc suxs. Waited ard 1hr for the food, when the next table which arrived LATER than me got their food already.. (Same order).. Checked 3x w d boss - Sharon only to be rebutted w her telling me if I wan to cancel my order..& that its our fault that we shifted 1 table to d side.. When she was d one who shifted us..  Not even a word of apology!! What kinda Svc can u expect when the boss is jus as attitude? The worst dining experience ever, with d most insincere n proud boss who doesn't give a hoot abt yr biz..

The location is great as you are on the street at the start of China Town. The only downside of it all is that the service decided that when I ordered a bucket of 5 beers they would open each of them when they brought it to the table. There was only 2 of us!

Found this bar/resturant some time ago and always enjoyed a pint here when visiting Singapore on business. Few tourists here but lots of locals and business people make it very natural and relaxing. Service is friendly and efficient. But the best kept secret is the NZ Sirloin steak. Great flavour and cooked to perfection. Sorry France, but never had anything as good as this when visiting Paris. It gets busy of a night (including weekdays) but I note you can make reservations. Recommended if in a group. If I am staying somewhere else in Singapore I take the MRT to Tanjong Pagar MRT station and it's a quick walk to the location. What I really like about this place is that it is genuine and authentic. Hope it doesn't change. Back for a pint later in the year
