This recommended Thai place in a quiet neighborhood in Aljunied. The food is nice with lot of variety. Leave some space for desserts.

After a week of home cooking and loads of weekly routine activities, what I was craving for that Saturday evening was awesome Thai food. We were browsing on the net for places that served thai cuisine near Paya Lebar, as we happened to be in the area. And we found this quaint little place, Spicy Thai Kitchen. It was bustling with lot of family laughter and warmth, and the nice ambience which was relaxing. The service is quick, the menu is vast , the price is reasonable and the taste puts you in another world..!!When I took the first bite of the Mango salad ...It was just awesome. Then the green curry, mushroom soup, chicken wings, prawn salad and fished it off with a wonderful coconut ice cream. If around Paya Lebar/Gelang/Aljunied or just visit specially for the food. Slurrrrp!

#batamliciouzinsg . Now I wasn’t sure if this cafe is suitable for an Oppa like me. I am not a “thai thai” you know. But for good food, I am onzzz lahhhhh. So this place serves Thai food! And it is not those kind of chill out modern kinda cafes. It is actually more like an eating house..Some of the dishes really remind me of the flavors I had in Thailand. Here is my recommendation!- Kaeng Som Cha Om (soup) $18- Spicy Mini Wings with Deep Fried Lemongrass $10- Thai Sambal Sea Bass $Seasonal Price- Lala Bee Hoon $18.The overall flavor here is the very strong and tasty type. Especially Thai’s trademark soury taste. Just the way I like it because my tongue can take strong flavors. Some say the food here is spicy but for me, definitely not enough chili. Hahahaha➖➖➖➖➖CONCLUSIONLet me just say that I am impressed. To be able to produce such quality Thai food in a small neighborhood eatery like this, hats off to you guys! Hunt this down guys.➖➖➖➖➖#NONHALAL.LOCATION: @spicythaithaicafe- 115 Aljunied Ave 2, #01-35, Singapore- Nearest MRT: Aljunied or Payalebar (Green Line).HOURS⏰: 11:00 - midnight➖➖➖➖

First time after reading good review.Had phad Thai, Pandan chicken, tom yam (clear) & belachan fried rice.The phad Thai is one of best found outside Thailand. The tom yam is spicy but the taste is great and subtle.The belachan fried rice is a bit of let down as the seasonings are too subtle whilst the Pandan chickens have too much seasonings and not crispy as usually do.All in all, it's a good place to go if one misses Thai food

Large group of 7 so we had a chance to try a lot of choices. All were very good, but some tips... must order the butter prawns, absolutely delicious. The green papaya salad was great, order it over the green mango salad. Batter fried morning glory leaves were nice, everything we had was great

Spicy thai thai is my go-to neighbourhood Thai restaurant every time I crave for Thai food. I tried many Thai food here in SG and Spicy thai thai is the best one so far! The food & even the sauces are so authentic. Very underated restaurant. They deserve more attention!My favourite are Claypot Coconut tom yam soup, Grilled Pork neck, Green curry chicken, Fried Tang hoon. Sauces are awesome too!

Located in a ulu corner in Geylang East.. Food choices are not bad but prices are a bit inconsistent, the dessert ($8) cost more than a pineapple rice ($6). Food portions are small and a bit too salty. Deep fried pork knuckles is very dry and hard. Can be better

U can get a wide variety of Thai dishes in this restaurant. More notable are lala bee hoon, fried Kang Kong, basil crab and pineapple rice.Their fried pork knuckle can be quite a challenge to the teeth. Desserts wise the sticky rice and tapioca is good. The Thai milk tea is good also

Nice relaxed ambience, big al fresco dining area. Food is good and they have a fairly large variety. The prices & service are decent.

just got back from there, nice and cosy area. food over there is nice and affordable especially their Mookata (thai style bbq) is very nice

Tried at this restaurant, read the Menu and saw a nice pic of the "Mookata Starter Set" priced @ S$35 - decided to go for it. To our horror, the food arrived unappealing and fell deeply short of what we expected as compared to the illustration in the menu.(1) Veges served were rotten.(2) Egg was cracked.(3) There was no tofu, fish, squids, mushrooms and other veges as illustrated in the Starter Menu.(4) Meatballs tastes sour.(5) Scallops tastes wierd.Upon clarifying with a staff, it was then made known that the illustration on the page of "Mookata Starter Set" was meant for illustration purposes only, which wasn't indicated anywhere on these 2 pages of the "Mookata" menu, and not briefed at all by the staff during order taking.Felt cheated

I was recommended by a friend who knows I like Thai cuisine, but the food standard is really a disappointment. Not sure if the cook is a Thai or Malaysian as the waiters & waitress are all Malaysian. Paid S$45 for crab tang hoon but the crab meat is hard and cold, and the tanghoon is so bland absolutely tasteless. Fried Pork is not fresh as there's a smell of it, it's awful. The only dish that I feel is fresh & good I think is only the fresh Thai coconut. Waiter is not very friendly too, when he takes your order he will not answer to your question and when we order the dish in English he don't understand at all just flip the menu and ask you to point to him

Typically when one orders crab, the price is quoted as $ per kg. We were told the seasonal price is $45 (assumed per kg), but when we found the crab to be rather small, they said the quoted price was based on per unit of crab (typically around 0.6 - 0.7 kg). This is obviously underhanded way of pricing, as restaurants typically quote $ per kg. The small portion of "tang hoon" that came with the crab did not help. Taste-wise, this item was salty. The saving grace was the papaya salad with salted egg; it was good. Will not be back

I went to Spicy Thai - Thai Cafe Restaurant today . The food is authentic and very spicy ! There was a wide variety of dishes . They have every possible dishes you could find in Thai. From their menu , I saw that they also have Mookata . I would try more dishes when I go again . The prices are down to earth . We paid $47 for 5 dishes, two bottles of mineral water and a Red Ruby dessert. I will definitely go again when I crave for Thai food . Oh ya ... They accepted my reservation over the phone , unlike Nakhon Kitchen . Good recommendation !

Tuck away in an obscure area of Aljunied area, you will be hard pressed top locate this eatery serving amazing authentic Thai food at fair prices. Great service, clean and good spread of dishes ensure room for future visits to explore more ! If you are not sure what's good? stick to the norm - tom yum soup, som tam, pineapple rice, etc. You can't go wrong. Chances are, you would be planning future visits as the menu is quite wide. Is not air-conditioned , but the fans make the place breezy. Usually reservation is not needed, but for big group, best call in advance and reserve. Get transported to Thailand during the meal...it's that good :

Ordered Tom Yum seafood noodle, Phad Thai, mango salad and chicken drumsticks. The chef must have a hangover from last night as I never ate such a bitter and sour taste of meals in my life. The Tom Yum is not drinkable, Phad Thai has a weird taste. Only dish commendable was the fried chicken wings. This establishment will not last very long if it cannot even cook its own national dishes properly. The manager approached me and apologised but offered no discount although I complained how sour the dishes were. He said next time he would do something for me. Well, I doubt I would ever come or recommend this place and he would definitely not remember me! Bad service added to bad food

Another nett priced Thai restaurant that serves great value for money food!!! I love their BBQ chicken wings.. Similar to the hawker centre ones but bigger :) the seafood pad Thai was good :) a lot of squids and small shrimps. I also tried their tom yum soup but I don't normally spicy food. But this tom yum soup was pretty decent. I liked their shrimp omelette however, it was quite oily.. Even more oily than the BBQ chicken wings. The pineapple fried rice served with Chinese dried sausage and cashew nuts was good! :) it had the wok Hei taste too! I really liked the mango sticky rice :) for $6 it's a little pricer than Jal Thai but still decent chunks of mango :) I love the lemongrass drink, it was a cooling relieve for my sore throat

We have lived in the area for over 4 years and used to go shopping and eat out on a regular basis one block over. Little did we know that one block over was this nice Thai restaurant. The food is very authentic and the price is very reasonable. The menu choices are plentiful and the servings are quite reasonable. Since we were recommended this place we have been a couple of times and would recommend it if you want to experience the local eating yet in a clean place and value for mone
