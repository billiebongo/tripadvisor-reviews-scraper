Had high expectations due to advertising but must say that while food was decent, it falls short compared to other fine dining chinese restaurants. For the prices they charge, they could do better.

Making restaurant booking through Chope is a breeze and simple exercise and getting reward in return.

I always love the dim sum in Tung Lok Signature. The food is good n we had a good time there for lunch.
4
It is near office area. So it is quite convenient for us. My parents always enjoy the quality of food. Though this time we waited outside for 10 mins and there seemed to be no one there escorted the guest.
5
I love the atmosphere and food there, they are always good!!! I have always gone there for meals with my family..
5
Good place for Tim sum and not too crowded. Recommended food item are the egg tarts, Cheong Chong fan, steamed custard bun
4
Took the promotion set lunch for $39.80 consisting of Fish, Chicken Soup with Fish maw, Chilli crab prawn, Fried vegetables with mushroom, Fried rice followed by deserts.
Value for money, Decent.
4
The selection of food is good and the staff are very polite. The ambience is nice but a little cramp.
We enjoyed the meal together as a family.Thank you for enjoyable experience.
4
Nice food and good service. We went as a group of 3 and 1 of us do not like pork. The staff highlighted to us which are the food items that contain pork (as it is not stated on the menu) despite we were just talking among ourselves

I'm on a business trip and visited Tung Lok on my own. First disappointment was being seated next to a table the waiters use to clear plates and cutlery from other tables. I only realised that after some time after being seated, in the mainly empty restaurant. I ordered the signature Fois gras and the garoupa cooked two ways. A few minutes later the waiter told me the signature Fois gras requires a minimum order of two people. Well it didn't say that on the menu! I chose the more expensive Fois Gras dish instead. The fois gras arrived first. It was very burned on the outside and very mushy on the inside. I was very disappointed. The garoupa cooked two ways. The fried garoupa was served with salad and with what looked and tasted like burger sauce. The other garoupa was tender and had nice flavour but the quantity was very small. Overall the experience was poor for what should have been a quality dining experience, especially for the price
5
The Service team had been attentive to our needs. Even small request had been given upon our inquiry.
4
We went for late dinner and ordered shrimps, chicken and cucumber with garlic. All were delicious, service but good but they forgot our noodle dish.
4
staffs were very attentive and polite although the set meal served was a bit rush but I can understand its a business lunch hour
5
Food and Service was good, the standard of food was there, serving was acceptable, price was reasonable.
4
The food was good and prompt. Service staff were polite but as it was the peak period during lunch on a Sun, we had to qave to attract attention to get them to refill the tea. Otherwise, it was a pleasant lunch.
4
Went to Tung Lok for a business dinner. The atmosphere was very nice and the food was above average. We had many varieties of fish and local dishes.
5
Food was of good quality wait staff was earnest and alert. They were professional and attentive to our needs. My daughter had a very joyous birthday celebration
4
Service is good and the food is value for money. Cons - there is only 3 pieces of dim sum when a normal family consists of 4 family members so one do get to eat any variety of the dim sum.
4
We had booked a table to celebrate my husband and sister's birthday. The food was good as usual and service was also decent, but the celebration by the staff was a bit disappointing. For those who are familiar with Tung Lok, you would know that on customers' birthdays, Tung Lok would prepare longevity buns and also recite a very meaningful poem based on the customer's age. At least, that's what Tung Lok Xihe Peking Duck at Orchard Central does, very enthusiastically and willingly. Tung Lok Signatures at Changi City Point provides the longevity buns, but the enthusiasm is lacking, and they only have 1 staff who can recite the poem. So if you are looking to celebrate a loved one's birthday, do consider other branches of Tung Lok, or call this branch in advance to make sure that the staff is working that day.

To be frank, I patronize this restaurant quite often (at least once a month) and it never disappoint me.It offers fresh seafood thoughtfully prepared in a unique way which some you might never taste before else where.Though it might be a bit pricey, it is worth trying.The food offered in set menu were thoughtfully laid down in such a way your stomach might not feel too filling after having tasted all.It offers great dessert especially the aloe vera lime jelly top with lychee shorbert which very refreshing and not too sweet.
4
The reservation is meant for a networking dinner and the comments from the trainers are very positive.
5
Went for the outlet at Changi City Point on Sunday for dinner. Crowd is reasonable. Ordered few dishes and taste is great. Can be a bit pricey but for the quality of it, I feel worth to indulgence once in a while.
3
Food was so so environment was very warm where its seems the aircon is limited. Was given a table that was beside their dustbin.
5
Food was good with service levels being good as well. Food is a little pricey so be prepared to spend.
5
Yummy food and dimsum. Though a little bit expensive. Service is good and overall ambience and environment is clean.
5
Excellent place to celebrate special occasions. Tasty food with nice ambience. Attentive servers and their recommendations are excellent and practical. Told me I may have ordered too much for our small family. Lol!!
3
Nice ambience and helpful staff. Chilli crab is yummy but dim sum are disappointed. We ordered 3 different steamed dim sum and almost all of them are broken. Dumpling skin is hard. Hope the quality control can be improved.

Upon arrival at restaurant, there were many workers around but nobody bothered to come to me until I have to wave at them? And the person who came never bothered to greet and just walked towards my table? Another person came to take my order, she was slightly better, at least she had a smiley face. And when the bill came, another person rudely placed the bill on the table with no eye contact and nothing being said. After giving her my credit card, she rudely placed the bill back on the table and this time round, the pen rolled on the table and I got really pissed and looked at her. She just apologised unwillingly. Tung Lok Signature is supposed to be the highest tier among their restaurants and this was the kind of service I received. It was the worst dining experience ever in Singapore. Food was lousy too for the high price charged
4
We had century egg with duck congee which was thick and flavourful. The usual dim sum fare like Char Siew Pow, Siew Mai etc are fresh and of good quality.Desserts are nice. We had the avocado beancurd with ice cream and durian with ice cream and black glutinous rice served in a young coconut
4
Do make reservation for big groups. Can pre-order from the online menus. Staff are efficient and attentive. Food is good, except for a dish or two that are a wee bit too salty. Air-con can get a bit cold after a while. Good for return visit.
5
The service & food are excellent as usual.
Could use another 1 or 2 very pure vegetarian dishes though (no egg, no beancurd & mushrooms/fungus)
5
Have been patronising this restaurant for their consistent cooking, served with good service. Great value deals to enjoy everyday.
4
The roast duck was nice, meat was tender and the skin crispy. Prawns were fresh. Service was good though they could be fast in serving the duck meat. We finished all the other dishes and the duck was not yet here.
4
Overall experience is quite good. The food and atmosphere were nice. The staff are polite but seems shorthanded
5
Had an enjoyable family lunch with quality food and attentive service. Restaurant was almost full but not overly noisy.
4
Good food, fast service, value for money.. Good promotion everyday of the week.. Ideal for gatheribg too!
5
One of the best Chinese restaurants in Singapore. A lot of Cantonese food for us to order until we don't know which dish to choose from it's menu.
4
Well presented and tasty dishes, which can be customised to suit individual tastes. Conveniently located in the Changi City Point Mall in the Changi Business Park, this place could be a great way to entertain clients at work for lunch or dinner or even visit family and friends.Prices are a bit on the higher side, but if you are seeking a good quality meal with clients or friends, I would recommend this place
4
Came here for dim sum lunch. Ordered Xiao long bao, fried turnip cake, crispy pork belly, fried fish skin, roasted London duck, fried beancurdskin, shrimp roll with mango, salted egg till bun, steamed chicken claw and tea.Overall the food is good except the Xiao long bao skin is hard
4
the egg custard bun is better this time. The bun consumed during the last visit was over done. Looks like the quality is not consistent each time. Having eaten here so often, the menu can get a little boring and there is nothing new added to the menu. having the restaurant near my office means having to eat there very often as it's the only good Chinese restaurant around here. Would be nice if they introduce something new each month.
3
Tried their Sunday dim sum and found most of their standard dishes were quite ordinary and some even underwhelming. Their roast duck, roast pork belly, sweet & sour pork and fried rice that we ordered from the main menu were much better.
3
service and ambience were good, could be the reasons for a return trip, over-rated food reviews killed the expectations.
4
Came here for lunch today for the first time in quite a while. Opted for various dim sum shared between three of us. Quite good food and efficient service. Happy to visit again.
4
It was a nice gesture for the restaurant to give free birthday buns
Nice restaurant, great food and service
4
Good service and fast service. Convenient to visit. Value for money and atmosphere is good. Will visit again!
5
The roast duck we had was moist and tasty. Salted egg deep fried fish skin was the best I've had. Very satisfied
5
good service from the crew. Would recommended us dishes when we cant decide.
cater to our need. Food is very enjoyable. Is a bit on the higher range of price but personally feel the food is good.
5
Celebrated my momsie birthday and it was great and delightful to have helpful staff working that day.
5
The captain and waitresses are very patient to attend to our needs, on 26Feb2017 dinner. We had two tables. We brought a birthday cake for my dad, and it was nicely placed on the side of a very big plate with well wishes nicely calligraphed (in Chinese) on left side of plate. Keep it up
2
Salted egg fish skin were fried in stale oil and staff took back at our request and agreed that it was badly fried and will give a fresh batch. Did not come back till we asked again, then was informed that they ran out of fish skin hence will not charge for item.In our previous experience, the mango sago was watery, bland and yet manager insisted it was like that
5
We had a most enjoyable and impressive dining experience at the Tung Lok Signatures at Changi City Point. The service staff were all very attentive and well trained. Food was delectable and my Leadership Team all gave their thumbs up. Well done!
5
This is a stunning restaurant. The menu is varied and everything mind blowingly lovely.
Could do with a better choice of beers but a minor issue in amongst real star quality.
4
Food is not bad. The service is good.
Price is reasonable.
A good place to eat when you are in the area.
4
The most difficult part here, was to choose among all the choice available.We had a variety of dumplings, crab, prawns, scallops and all were good.Smoked duck with pan cakes was great too, as well as the roasted duck.And the top dish of the meal was the fried rice with prawns and green beans: Excellent indeed!Plus a good Tiger beer draft and that was a great experience
5
First recommendation, lotus leaf sticky rice! So soft and tender tasty rice and meat, with a little bit of fried shallots and shrimps. If you like glutinous rice, must try this.My Aunty loves braised vinegar pork knuckle with ginger slice inside. Tender meat, chewy pork skin, sweet sour gravy. Usually my Aunty will eat them all by herself. Crystal skin with fresh prawn & lots of spring onion, if you like the strong taste of the spring onion. Skin is not too thick, just nice. Char Siew pao, egg tarts and the salted egg yolk paste longevity bao are the must order dishes. Not to worry they all are pretty small in size. They are smaller than the usual ones we eat outside. Their bao skin is very light, very thin and it's hardly can make you full. Especially the egg tart, one mouth for one tart.Last time I tried the carrot cake it was normal, this time the yam cake is nicer. Lastly, prawn Chu Cheong fun is not very enchanting. I would prefer so have some fried shallots springing on top, or a bit of prawn chili paste to go with like how we have else where. Bravo! Keep up the good service and good food

Tung Lok Signature Changi City has 2 types of seating, within the restaurant or external of the restaurant overlooking the basement atrium of the mall. Cosy indoor seating area.Prefer external seating, able to enjoy the meal and watch people doing various activities; sometimes can also witness the emcee hosted shows at the basement atrium. Friendly helpful waiters and waitresses. Nice food at above average prices. Estimated about $55 per person for dinner. Reservation recommended for weekend lunch
4
Food was great as it was the Chinese New Year Season, they have the CNY dish which is the Yu Sheng and it cost a reasonable $48 for the salmon, I would say it is value for money for the freshness of the vegetables and flavors they put in, (This dish is only available on CNY) Since it was only two of us, we ordered a glutinous rice Yuan Yang and Bak Choi with black most, I have to say the Bak Choi impressed me the most as it had dry oysters the size of a humans thumb (a FAT Human thumb) perfectly made dish. The cost for our dinner with tea was only $150 with tea and nuts. I would say reasonably priced for the quality of food
5
We came here for my mother's birthday on a Monday evening. Food was nice, service was good. We have been here before so this was something we kind of expected. What we didn't expect was when they serve us the birthday buns with personalized calligraphy on the plate by the Chef. Thanks for the pleasant surprise
1
Tung Lok have many outlets but this one at Changi City point is a disappointment. Waiter can collect plates over the head of customer and drop onto us. The attitude of the waiter and waitress is impatient even when they take order and the do not know their menu well so don't expect them to give any recommendation. Birthday buns are out of shaped which really unacceptable. We also feedback to them that they durian black glutinous rice is sour which we believe is spoilt but the lady only reply "oh is it?" Never patronise this restaurant at Changi City poin

Had dinner here. The staff were attentive and paid attention to dietary requirements. The food, in general, was rather average though one of the dishes (the mixed vegetables) very nice. However, overall the rest of the dishes did not hit the same heights. A decent spot for eating. Perhaps the meat options are better but we were a party of vegetarians so didn't try any of those
