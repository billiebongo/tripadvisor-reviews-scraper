Delicious food, good service. You order on a touch screen on the booth, waitresses can help you if you're stuck. But it is easy.

It was my first time to try japanese food, but the sashimi was very tasty and the sushi also, they are frequently serving green tea along the food. It was very nice.

Having dinner with my daughter here as she was craving for Japanese food. Try this new place have some sashimi, tebasakhi and some cold soba. Very nicer after all, and the price is good especially if you ordered before 7pm, you will get 20% discount

Went to Kotobuki for a business lunch with a relatively large group. The service was very streamlined and efficient. The food is good and the service was also good. I had a lunchtime Bento Box which hit the spot. If you want a quick meal with food and service that is good this place will hit the spot

At the Raffles Place outlet which was packed even before 12 pm, it was essential 'eat n go' as once you finished they clear your plate and give you the hint to move on for other clientsDon't expect fine dining but dine n go ! we had the udon with one miserable tempura prawn and i was not impressed.There is another jap restaurant (same owner) next door doing healthy food . watch that space on how they fare

We went on a saturday lunch, hence the restaurant was quite as it in the CBD area.The food was of a very high standard, mixed sashimi came good sized portions. Grilled salmon set was very good, the miso soup was to my liking.Mixed tempura dipping source just made the dish.Value for money this restaurant is really good bearing in mind the location. We were given a 20% discount, not sure why. I will return to another branch nearer my home. The wait staff were very good and were attentive

My Wife and I visited the Kotobuki Restaurant at Holland Village in May on a Sunday evening.It's a small cosy restaurant, in a fairly relaxed comfortable setting. We ordered sashimi, BBQ chicken ball, pork belly skewer, gintara teriyaki and garlic fried rice.The food were of a good quality. However I would prefer that they serve me the cold dish first (ie sashimi) followed by the hot dishes. They have got the order wrong so we waited for the sashimi to arrive before eating the hot food.It was otherwise an enjoyable meal

Visited this restaurant located at One Raffles Place and ordered the Yusheng. Its one of the best Yusheng i've had as the ingredients are fresh and serving generous and the sauce is not overly sweet. As we don't take raw fish, the chef cooked it for us.

This place has a pretty amazing menu with a really extensive selection, making it a little tricky to decide what to have. There's a good selection of set meals to choose from, the main challenge being to select one of the many alternatives. I opted for the tempura moriawase set, which consists of some tempura, some fairly average sushi, and a miso soup. Pretty busy place but no problems getting a seat at about 12:15. No reservations unless you have 6+ people

For lunch today, the selected venue was Kotobuki Japanese Restaurant, furnished in good old Japanese fashion.*N chose the Yaki Udon (SGD$14.00), also known as pan-fried udon noodles, laden with shrimps and omelet; fried in good texture so that the udon noodles remained springy and well-oiled yet not greasy. Flavour was absolute, hence bringing surprise to the fact that such a deceptively-looking dish could be that tasty. No wonder the Japanese lady sitting beside *N also ordered the same item.I decided to go for the Sashimi Don (SGD$24.00), assorted raw fish in rice bowl. I love the bouncy, juicy and chewy thick slices of seafood here. Nothing perks my day more than a good mix of sashimi that retains its textures and entices the eater with its pristine flavour. The serving was generous and I appreciated that as well.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/04/lunch-at-kotobuki-japanese-restaurant.htm
