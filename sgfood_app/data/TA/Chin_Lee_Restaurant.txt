I love the heart that goes into the food at this restaurant, service maybe a little brute but the chef's thoughts and heart that goes into cooking the food is heartwarming.

Long established authentic Teochew restaurant in an HDB block. Opposite Fengshan food centre and Bedok police station. Need to make reservations for weekends. Slightly pricey considering the location. 3 dishes shown are their signatures.

Chin Lee is quite a heritage Teo chew restaurant, had been there for the longest time. The Teochew food there is consistently tasty and at Neighbourhood price.

First time dining at this restaurant..and satisfied with the great food and service.All the dishes that we ordered, met with a seal of approval from all of us, especially my father-in-law, ( was celebrating his birthday )We now have a new place to dine when we crave for Teochew foo

If you want to eat Teochew food, you must try this restaurant. The food served is GOOD! You will not feel thirsty after dinner. This shows that the food is not "stuffed" with MSG. I always go for the fish maw soup, coffee pork rib, toufu and yam paste dessert (orh ngee). Price is more expensive than popular chi-zhar stall but it truly worth it. Must make a booking for weekend meal because it always packed like sardine

Review by DrSim001. Good Chinese Teochew Food. Good Services. Nice ambience. Like all typical Chinese Restaurant it is noisy. Tourists should Try. Restaurant in Heartland in public housing. If you are a tourist, ask a local to bring you. One of the better Chinese Teochew Restaurants. Try the Chef's Recommendation: Conpoy and Fish Maw Soup. Teochew Spring Roll. Teochew Kuay Teow. Fried Teochew Pig Trotter. Regards DrSim001

Came here for a family dinner on a weekend because it was muchly raved about by my relatives. 2 sessions for dinner: 5:30PM & 7:30PM-- if you know what's good for you, call to book in advance.Service was honestly average- they kept refilling our glasses with the champagne we brought before it even had time to chill in the bucket. Also, the first waitress who wanted to serve our first glass of champagne didn't know how to pour champagne LOL hmm. But they WERE prompt in clearing plates when necessary, which is great when you're having a food marathon gobbling all that delicious food down.Cover Charge constitutes Chinese Tea (they only have 普洱茶 Pu'er Tea), wet tissue, & water. It costs $1.50/pax, but they reduced it to $0.50/pax if we showed them proof that we voted for them in the SG Food Master 2017 competition. Is this considered bribery? Heh.潮州冻蟹 Teochew Cold CrabWonderful tender meat that is easy to peel. Plenty of roe. Ate it on its own, didn't fancy the sauce much.咖啡排骨 Coffee Pork RibsThis smells amazing & you cannot not notice its fragrance. Slightly sweet, tender meat. Not surprised this is on their Chef's Recommendation menu.招牌潮州虾枣 Home-made Teochew Prawn BallBest hae zuk I've ever tasted. Soft on the inside, not too oily, & a great sauce. This is their representative dish in the SG Food Master 2017 competition.乳猪 Char-roasted Suckling PigYou have to pre-order this. I am not one for suckling pigs so I will refrain from any comments.家乡豆腐 Famous Home-made BeancurdSoft beancurd with lovely minced meat on top.XO酱炒四季豆苗 Stir-fried French Bean with XO SauceA simple dish that still retains its crunchy texture. Bliss.咕咾肉 Sweet & Sour PorkOnly because there's someone at the table who practically doesn't eat anything except this dish.菜莆粿条 Teochew Kway TeowCrazy amazing. By far one of the top dishes we had that night. Can't figure out what's so magical about it- the insane wok hei? The silky smooth noodles? How truly simple yet flavourful it is? I really wanted more. Like, order a whole plate to myself & gobble it up!!金瓜白果芋泥 Teochew Yam Paste & Pumpkin served with Gingko NutGreat way to end the night with an authentic Teochew dessert. Creamy smooth orh nee that isn't saccharine sweet. A non-pumpkin alternative is also available. Can see why this is raved about. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats available☀️ Al fresco seats available No GST or Service Charge Best to reserve - call the

The place was packed on a Sunday night and most of the tables are for large groups, both inside and outside under the covered shelter. It can be noisy too. We were pleased with every dish we ordered, they were well executed, especially the steamed pomfret (a steal at $50 for a fairly large fish), the fish maw soup, and the Mee Sua. With a rather expensive bottle of red wine, the bill came to $65 a person, which was pretty good value. Will definitely return.

Although I have been living in the East for decades, it was only recently that I learnt of Chin Lee Restaurant. We frequent Fengshan Hawker Centre which is about 5 mins walk from Chin Lee Restaurant. Restaurant is directly opposite the Bedok Division Police Station, and about 100 metres from Bethesda Bedok Tampines Church.We came on a weekday before noon and 2 tables of 12 persons were filled. As there were only 2 of us, we ordered the char kway teow with chai poh ($10.00), bittergourd with sliced fish ($12.00), oyster omelette ($16.00) and 2 bowls of orh nee (taro and pumpkin) dessert ($8.00). Although there was no service charge, there is however a cover charge of $1.50 per person and $2.00 for the steamed nuts appetiser. Our bill came up to $54.55.Although most reviewers raved about the fried kway teow with radish (Chai Poh), it was a bit oily and I would prefer it with some gravy. It was delicious though with a nice wok hei flavour. We gave top marks for the bittergourd with the sliced chunky fish meat with braised black bean sauce. The orh chien (oyster omelette) was also yummy with juicy huge oysters. The hot taro and pumpkin dessert is really super delicious, and is one of the best I have tasted in years.Reasonaby priced and highly recommended if you crave for good Teochew food

Review by Dr Sim. One of the best Teochew Restaurants in Singapore. Food is excellent. Service is below average. Very crowded. A bit far but good for a tourist to try, if brought by a local. You need to order in Mandarin. Very noisy. Difficult to talk business in the environment. Regards Dr Si

Booked 2 tables to celebrate our daughter's first birthday. Luckily we booked way in advance and got the tables inside the restaurant which are air-condition.
Each of us spent around S$30+ and it was value for money. Food was yummy!

The food is great but I believe could be better if there weren't so many people. We had the steamed pomfret, pig trotter jelly, prawn rolls, suckling pig and teochew chup chye

Nestled in HBD Blk 115 , Bedok is one authentic and Teochew restaurant. Parking is convenient as There's HBD multi story carpark next to the block. Suggest to make a booking before heading there as it does draw a sizeable crowd. Don't be surprised one needs to wait without a booking even though there's additional tables outside of the restaurant. Try the steam fish, Kway Teow with Chai Poh, pork rib, salted eggs prawns and their yam dessert . Servings decent size and not overly large. Worth a try 
5
Ate there last night and found their fare to be excellent. Enjoyed the fish maw, hae cho, braised duck, coffee ribs, speciality sea cucumber and wow!! the signature chai poh kway teow. The restaurant was packed - inside and out - but Desmond, (the "main man") who greeted us, gave attentive and good service whenever he was available. And unlike some heartland restaurants that charge up to $30 for corkage for a bottle of wine, Chin Lee has no corkage at all. Definitely a plus point!!Will certainly go back for dishes we did not try.Erro

This is a hidden gem. And because it is located in a Government housing estate, the prices are kept affordable. Most importantly, the food is good. Many restaurants have a few outstanding dishes but here at Chin Lee, most of the dishes are good and the dishes are cooked in the traditional way like the Steamed Pomfret, Teochew Fried Kway Teow and Orh Nee
5
This is a Teochew restaurant located at the ground floor of a HDB flat in Bedok.The place is simple and crowd is mainly local Chinese families. We ordered the crispy pig trotter, chilled pig trotter jelly, homemade prawn ball (hae zhor), fish maw soup, sambal crayfish, Teochew steam pomfret, teochew fried kway teow and or ni. All the food was very authentic and delicious. By far, one of the best Teochew restaurants in Singapore.The overall price is reasonable and the portion is just right

We came here to celebrate my birthday with my family, by enjoying some fine Teochew food. It is the first time all (except for my dad) who has been here, and we ordered 8 dishes to share amongst 5 of us. It was on CNY day 4, so it was lucky we had booked a table before CNY started. Apparently there are 3 seating times that we had a choice from 6pm, 7.30pm and 9pm. 7.30pm was chosen, and it was good that we made a booking, as the restaurant was extremely busy. Taking orders, we felt as if we were rushed a little. We had asked for a recommendation of meats and fish, but the head hostess' comments were 'you need to tell me what you like first then I can choose for you' (in Mandarin). That was slightly off-putting, as we wanted a recommendation, not something chosen for us. After we made our order, food arrived quickly and service (in terms of dishing out food) was quick and efficient. Quality of food was unblemished - we could not find any fault with it whatsoever. It was not too salty, not too oily, not too piping hot, the balance of all the dishes was just right. After most of our last dish is finished, the bill came and they started hovering around our table, as if wanting us to get up so that they can prepare for the next seating. Considering we had finished everything by 8.15pm, they had 45 mins to get the table ready, so we felt like we were being chased out at the end. After I had paid, I just walked out of the restaurant a few steps only to realise that I had forgotten my 'doggy bag' of food that was leftover for me to take home. Promptly turning back, I asked 2 of the waitresses about my packet of food, and they denied all knowledge (our table was already made/turned over for the next batch of customers!), with a rushed and 'couldn't care less' attitude. I had to go to the head waitress and made a little fuss, before she remembered where it was left and I finally got it. Brilliant food quality, efficient service, but customer service lacking the personal touch somewhat - I put it down where the waitresses/hostess was from (China), rather than the busy-ness of the restaurant itself

Chin Lee is a long established Chinese Restaurant specializing in Teochew cuisine. Their quality is good, however, NOT recommended during the festive period where the restaurant get too crowded and noisy for a decent conversation. AND customer service become lacking, if not, pushy, as they try to clear u out of the restaurant asap.They forgot our order, we have finished everything on the table, dishes all cleared, and had to wait 15mins for that one dish. We saw the same dish being served to surrounding tables and inquired if they have forgotten about it, which would be understandable given that they are busy. They insist NO in a rather Harsh Tone, and lectured us that they need time to prepare (yah, and we ordered 1 hour ago), which make people doubt their sincerity ..

We are a teochew family. This is the restaurant which we will held our annual Chinese New Year gathering dinner. It never fails to impressed us with its great tasting dishes and competitive prices.There are 10 adults and 5 kids altogether and our bill comes up to be around $540, which in today's terms and in view of the quality of our food items, is simply amazing!Some items we had included the shark fins soup, which consisted of whole and large pieces of the delicacy, pomfret which is the typical teochew fish which is not cheap especially during Chinese New Year. The dessert of course was yam paste, another typical teochew dessert!Price was definitely a draw, but the taste and authenticity of its teochew roots was what drew us back each and every year!
5
We love Chin Lee. Always been our place of choice for guests and for family dinner.The pig trotter jelly is superb, the coffee rib is really good. And the ohr Nee is the best.Basically all other dishes are very decent as well. All these without a hole in the pocket
4
The food was good except that the food was served too hurriedly. The whole table was filled with the dishes we ordered. Before we finish one dish, another 2 would be ready to be served.
4
If you should find this place, which is located on the ground floor of apartment complex, the Taechew Cols Crab is a must. It is to die for.
5
All of us like to go to Chin Lee. Great food with reasonable price.
We especially like the Orh Nee, Coffee Ribs, Fish Maw Soup, Prawn Rolls, Homemade Tofu, And Pig trotter
4
This restaurant serves authentic Taechoew dishes. Good service. Delicious and valuable on all dishes.

We were looking for a place to eat a late dinner when we found Chin Lee on Tripadvisor. Our group went at about 9.45pm and the staff welcomed us. We ordered prawn roll, fish maw soup, salted egg prawn, vegetable, fried rice and an egg hor fun. The food is delicious. The service is prompt and friendly. The price is reasonable as it is an air conditioned place and nicely furnished. We were the only table by 10pm. Our group left at 10.20pm and the staff remained friendly. I'll recommend this place for the service and the food.
5
This is an old institution for Teochew cuisine. The set up is HDB Aircon Restsurant but u get to seat al-fresco if u didn't make a reservation, even on a slow Monday evening!We ordered the fish Mae soup and its full for ingredients and tasty to boot!Next the green vegetable is good without being over done like some Zhi char place. And the coffee pork rib is tender and so yummily coffe-licious!Last but not least, the chye po (pickled raddish) kway teow...looks good (like pancake), taste heavenly...just salty enough to tease the taste-bug, and the wok-hei!!! Wow wow wow!ps: the starters-braised peanut is yummy too
5
Had a family reunion feast at Chin Lee. My wife's family are Teochew and this was a great introduction to Teochew cuisine for me. We had a 10 course meal, very generous portions. A very succulent and crispy pork was served as one of our starter and it was amazing! A must try
4
First time having a family meal (8 of us) at this restaurant last Saturday. Parents in-law are 100% Teochew. By 1230pm, the restaurant (indoor) was already full house. They have outdoor seating too. We ordered their signature dishes such as Teochew steamed pomfret, coffee pork ribs, Teochew prawn balls, chilled pig trotter jelly, fish maw thick soup, stir-fried spinach with garlic and crispy chicken. We also finished out with their signature yam paste and other desserts.The steamed fish cost $60 but it was very fresh! Most of the dishes have won my Mother-in-law's taste test, which is not usual. I personally like the fish maw soup the most! All the other dishes are actually really good. Not very saltish. The only dish that is only so-so was the crispy chicken. The skin was no doubt crispy but the meat was dry. The yam paste with pumpkin was yummy, above average and it cost only $4.50. We also tried their mango purÃ©e, imperial cleansing jelly and longan with Beancurd. All are $3.50 but the serving was small. Let's just say their desserts, except the yam paste are not the main focus in this restaurant. Can give it a miss.Will definitely bring my family to patronise this restaurant more frequent. They have so many decent Teochew dishes to offer with reasonable pricing.The meal cost us $200 in total and money is well spent

Located at Blk 115 Bedok North Avenue nearest transport is Bedok mrt and Bedok bus terminal followed by taxi.Its signature dish is the well stewed goose meat with soft beancurb marinated with black sauce and five spice powder and dipped in vinegarate garlic chilli.The young piglet is roasted on charcoal pit slowly and laboriously to give you a wonderful crispy succulent roast to be dipped in sweet sauce.To start off your meal order a platter of mixed starter of steam big prawns coated with mayonnaise in mixed fruits, springy jellyfish, prawn rolls, cold jellied pig skin and innards and prawn friiters .... a wonderful delight.Steamed promfret with fat lard, salted mustard green, mushroom in light soup is a Teochew clear steam as the fish should be eaten fresh. Scallops sauteed with green broccoli is pleasant with the other deep fried dishes. Big prawns coated with salted egg is crunchy and savoury.End the lunch with its infamous Or Nee (yampaste steam and mashed with pork lard and topped with pek kuay (ginko nut) dessert. To start the birthday with steam bean paste bun and end it with noodles to signify longevity
5
Restaurant serves authentic Teochew dishes. Recommended to bring along parents or grandparents who really know how to appreciate the flavours and beauty of such dishes. Call in advance to make a reservation, dishes can also be ordered via phone. This will then allow the dishes to be served quickly upon reaching the restaurant
4
Love the food here even though some taste different from other teochew restaurant but overall the food is authentic & nice....highly recommended for family gathering for the price & ambiance...
4
Chin Lee Restaurant in Bedok serving traditional Teochew dishes for past 43 years. Very authentic and good taste
4
This place serves nice Teochew food at affordable prices. You must book on weekends or else no table.
Most of their dishes are quite authentic and delicious.
Service is only average.
Not much ambience.
4
the suckling pig was delicious, the skin was crispy and yummy. the fried mee sua, steamed fish, salted egg prawn, steamed crab was delicious. lovely place in the neighborhood for family gathering..
5
Set in Bedok neighborhood. Excellent food and very decent price. My wife brought her well-healed friends no strangers to the best Resturant food in Singapore. Their verdict: cheap and good. They tabao too!

Craving for Teochew (a dialect group in the Chinese ethnic race) cuisine visit Blk 115 of Bedok North with no regrets.Their infamous braised duck is soft and flavourful. It is cooked with cinnamon stick, aniseed and their secret ingredients. Immersed your white rice with their stewed gravy you are having the ultimate taste with its soft duck dipped in vinegerate chilli garlic.The white chives are cooked with deep fried thin fish flakes (teek poh) and fresh big prawns crunchy with every bite.Oyster pancake was done very crispy except oysters are not big enough.The chilli crayfish was very fresh and value for money and the full enjoyment was when you dipped your bite size man toh bun in its thick gravy.All in the meal amounted to S$99 with good service even though they are crowded
5
Was on a business dinner with business partners as the place was recommended by my boss. The place is a Teochew Eden in the dense residential HDB estate.Never had much experience with Teochew cusines in restaurants but this restaurant has certainly set my tastebud standards. The Sambal Chili Crayfish was the highlight and it is a certainly must try
4
I am Teochew and I must say these are the few places that still serves a few good Teochew Dishes. Visited with a group of friends on the 17th FEB and it was reallly crowded, glad a reservation was made in advance. I particularly enjoyed the Fish Maw Soup and the "Hei Zho" which are prawn rolls. Brings back memories of how my Dad use to cook it. The fish was a little over steamed although i love the salty soup/sauce that came with it. Spring Chicken was also decent but nothing extraordinary. Had the Yam Paste for dessert and it is very good too! However, i recommend that you share it as it can get a little too oily. We had about 7 dishes for 6 people and the bill was close to $300. Not cheap but value for money if you order the right dishes.Overall, a place where i will go back for some comfort Teochew food

We dine here for birthdays celebration. Ordered the set menu of $588++ for 2 tables. There were 8 dishes. The cold combination appetizer; shark fin soup; garlic roasted (or fried) chicken; abalone with mushroom and chinese spinach; fried noodles; orange prawn; steam giant pomfret; yam paste dessert. Overall.. the food doesnt meet my standard. They were either too plain or too strange for my tastebuds. Yes the ingredients were all of high standard. But seems like they were cooked wrongly. The jellyfish in the cold combo appetizer was far tooooo sweet. The orange prawn feels so strange we have lots leftover. The fish was oversteamed and the salty lettuce made the fish taste bitter. Even the dessert yam paste was horrible. I dont really know why they need to combine it with pumpkin. Totally inedible. I am at lost I cant even name my favorite dishes from all those 8. Dont think I will go back. Sorry
3
The restaurant looked really authentic. And I expected it to be looking at the tables of families filling up the place quickly. The dishes were overall acceptable. But the steam pomfret left a bad impression. Because it is steam teochew style, the freshness of the pomfret is key. So it was disappointing that it was rather fishy
4
Yummy authentic teochew food and Captain Cindy Chin added a personal touch to our meal! Thumbs up!!!
5
Cosy and good place for lunch or dinner. Serves authentic teochew , food highly recommended. Remember to order yam paste dessert
4
Once again, we were back at this restaurant for our reunion dinner. What impressed me most is the fact that even when the restaurant is running full house, the standard of the dishes are not compromised.This place serves authentic teochew dishes, even the yu sheng which Chinese will eat during the cny. Not many places in Singapore serves the teochew version of the yu sheng so do check them out
5
My dinner group had a nite out at this restaurant. 7 of us had their soup of the day, home make tofu, chestnut chicken, crispy pig trotter, garlic asparagus, crayfish with cabbage wrap and teochew Kway teow. Bill came to $232. It was a steal as the food quality was excellent on most part and the quantity was such that we nearly could not finish the last item which was the Kway teow. The soup was good and had Fish maw, abalone and chicken together with some unique herbs which I have not heard of. Definitely a better alternative to shark's fin.We had the crispy pig trotter instead of suckling pig as they do not take order for 1/2 a pig and we felt that we would not be able to finish a whole suckling pig since some of us do not partake of this item. No regrets as the crispy pig trotter was excellent.So was the asparagus and chestnut chicken.The crayfish with cabbage was superb and was easily the best item of the night. Again the teochew's would usually wrap this with shark's fin and omelette but this beats that version hands down.The last item was the teochew Kway teow. It was less oily that that in most other teochew restaurant and was popular with the ladies.We were tempted to get the yam paste for dessert when the wait staff asked if we wanted any sweet to end dinner but were so stuffed we just could not put this in anymore. We took a raincheck on this.All in all an excellent meal and for he price we paid, a steal
5
We were a party of 9 to celebrate a birthday. Altogether there were 10 ala carte dishes --all Chinese "Teo chew" style cuisine. We were not disappointed. The pork terrine was served cold, which accentuated the delicate flavour of the pork. It did not have that strong "porky" taste but exudes that finesse that could rival the French version.The fish maw soup is to die for. It is one of the restaurant's signature dishes, The smooth texture of the soup gently combined with shredded ingredients of maw, prawns, egg drop etc reminds me of a good class seafood chowder without the cream. On balance it looked like superior shark fin soup and may taste like one with added plum vinegar sauce or better still add in some English mustard!The the stir fried coffee pork was excellent. With a slight tinge of sweetness and a strong hint of coffee roast it went well with our steamed white rice and judiciously accompanied by a bottle of Chardonnay.No Chinese dinner is complete with Teo Chew steamed pomfret . It was a real mother of all pomfret that was served for the birthday bash. You know it is fresh because it did not exude the typical "fishy" aroma and the flesh did not have that "powdery" or "card board" texture in the mouth. The gravy had all the essence of a delicately steamed fish with a concoction of pickled plums, salted vegetables, young ginger and coriander.The deep fried prawn roll ( hae chor) is a signature dish -- crispy on the outside and yet incredibly tender on the inside. It went well with sweet dark sauce.The braise duck was served like as though it was goose meat. The herb marinade was enough to blow your mind off especially accompanied by either a good bottle of Pinot noir.There were no corkage charges for the 7 bottles of wine we consumed. The service staff were really attentive to our table. Our soiled plates were regular replaced with clean ones. The waiting staff seem to know which type of wine glasses were to be used. You must make an effort at least in your lifetime to patronise this remarkable "neighbourhood" restaurant
4
Visited again after a long lapse and it is as good as before. Cannot think of a bad dish, although I thought the steamed pomfret was somewhat relatively over priced. Their yam pudding was, as usual, the best dish.Simple HDB void deck location but with cuisine fit for a Chinese wedding dinner and at very reasonable prices
5
My brother took us for lunch at this restaurant which is located in a HDB estate. There were 20 thus required seating of 2 tables. To cut down all the fuss, we chose the Set Lunch of the Day from the Menu. It was a 8 course dishes. The variety of food served from hot combinations , sharkfin soup ,steamed cod fish ,stewed duck in herbs with seacucumber & mushroom , stir fry spinach with scallops ,drunken prawns , fry mee suah to the last dessert of almond pudding was great to our delight and services rendered was efficient. The restaurant was packed with lunch crowd , but service staff were attentive and courteous. The restaurant is not big but the atmosphere is quite soothing with good clean toilets. A place worth patronising !!
4
Can't quite remember what we ordered (since the wife did the ordering).But general impression was that it's good food at good value in a HDB estate. Those without a car might have a bit of a walk since it's not near any MRT, probably 15min walk away.Or nee was definitely good, and so was the tao tai (steamed large white pomfret). Hae cho was also memorable, my 6 year old son normally takes 2-3
4
Very good value for money. Liked the variety of food it has. From steaming to deep fried, a very good variety. Always crowded, so not exactly my favourite place for dining unless I have lots of time. Because the place is so busy, some how I don't feel as warm when dining there (in terms of service). Can be quite cramp when the whole place is full. Good thing the ambience is soothing and the toilet is very clean. Will only dine there when have time.
4
Was here for a casual dinner again tonight, the last one here was sometimes in feb for the Chinese New Year reunion dinner.There's only 3 of us tonight and we ordered the tofu, spinach, fish maw soup and ngor hiang, typical teochew dishes. Everything met our expectations and we are teochews. Love the fish maw soup especially.The bill comes up to about 70 which seems to me to be abit on the high side for a restaurant located below a hdb block. On top of that, we ordered dishes which are pretty "simple"
