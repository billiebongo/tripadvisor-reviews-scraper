great taste! & friendly service! Like the Foie Gras Wagyu Don so muuuch! Also the Century Egg tofu is good choice. A little bit slow food serving but still can give 5star for the food.

Great place and amazing Japanese food with a twist, you have to try the salmon sashimi with fresh truffle, really nice combination of flavored.

Had the wagyu foie gras uni don, was really good. They also serve suntory beer on tap, was pretty amazing. Only one of the four places in Singapore that serves the black version of the beer on tap.

Very welcoming staff. And a great chef, whose menu seamlessly blends the traditional (eg ohtoro sashimi, which was delicious) with dishes that offer something new (wagyu beef, foie gras, and uni, which I could eat every single day it was so nice). I will definitely be back.

Shibuya Omakasei & Sushi Bar's high quality seafood and superb service keeps me coming back! Their Wagyu don with foie gras and uni, and truffle chirashi don, tops my list. With service staff that are extremely friendly and highly accommodating, my dining experience at Shibuya is made even better:) Thank you for the excellent food and brilliant service

Awesome food, good ambience. We came here for a casual meet up and had the Wagu uni and foie gras don based on a friend's recommendation. No regrets. The restaurant is ideal for both casual and formal meets. Best part, it's not harsh on the pockets
