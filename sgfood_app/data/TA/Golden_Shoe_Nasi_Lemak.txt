The redevelopment of the Golden Shoe complex has been announced so nasi lemak fans should enjoy this one before the food centre is closed (probably around mid year 2017?).For visitors who have never tasted nasi lemak - it is a dish traditionally served at breakfast but can now be enjoyed all day at certain specialty hawker stalls such as this one. The dish comprises coconut and pandan flavoured rice served with a fried egg, fried peanuts and ikan billis, deep fried chicken wing or drumstick and a savoury-sweet chilli sambal. Golden Shoe nasi lemak lets you pick and choose what you would like served with the rice. The distinctive green rice (or nasi) is cooked with juice from the pandan leaf. Regular recipes call for the rice to be steamed in coconut milk with a pandan leaf added for flavour.What we had today was delicious and at S$3.30 a plate, completely reasonable in pricy Singapore. Get there before 12 noon if you are planning to have lunch onsite as it gets really crowded after.

They serve nasi lemak or fried bee hoon, and you can select the sides that accompanies the carbohydrates, the popular ones of which are vegetables, chicken drumstick, chicken wing, luncheon meat, fried fish, egg, among others. Well recommended place to eat at Golden Shoe, and it's value-for-money too.
