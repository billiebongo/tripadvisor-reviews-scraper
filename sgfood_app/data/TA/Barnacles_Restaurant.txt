The Shangri la really know how to a brunch! Barnacles is set on the waters edge with fantastic views. The selection of foods is great and seafood is excellent!

Average food, nothing great. The flavors were not distinctive. I tried out varied options but except for shrimps and satays, nothing stood out

The only restaurant which looked O.K. on paper for a night away from the kids.The service was very poor - they bought the entre out before the breads and dip, forgot about my drink order altogether. My husband's fish was fowl tasting and we made every possible effort to get a waiter's attention and say something but no one came and checked on us. We decided to not go up to find a waiter and ask for another meal as we guessed it might be just as poorly cooked. My steak was overcooked but at least edible. They could obviously see my husband's meal wasn't eaten and on clearing the dishes didn't even ask how the meal was. We of course said the fish wasn't edible and they took the dish off the bill.Such a shame as we were looking forward to a night out so much. The seating outside was lovely however (but quite dated inside). Hopefully it was just an off-night for them

The food selections were excellent. Pictures will speak louder than words. There was live music for adults, and magician for the kids. After everyone has been well fed, you can even jump into the hotel pool for a swim. Definitely recommend if you are looking for quality / high end seafood buffet for the family.

This is a nice venue for a private occasion but by estimate it may not hold a hundred guests. The place is near the beach but the air conditioning units are not that comfortable. TEchnical support is also wanting and the food is not that great and tasteful

For a great range of food, good price and good service this is a hit. I liked the way they were only doing wine brunch but they flexed when I said I wanted champagne and my partner didn't drink and offered a low price on one and higher on another and took off the pool charge. The restaurant itself is old and a bit tacky but is fine for a brunch, very relaxed and not many people there so no queues unlike many others in Singapore.Recommended

We saw chefs cooking good bbq outdoors while we were heading back to room from the beach. Decided to come down later for dinner. Upon entry, we were told that the venue has been reserved for a private party however there was no sign in the hotel (at least where we could see) indicating so. Disappoint.

Came for a brunch: 5 adults and 6 kids. Kids eat free. No free flow champagne but we didn't mind at all. Seafood selection amazing. Kids loved their food and the chocolate fountain. Place has outside and inside seating areas. Plenty of room and kids entertainment by a super engaging clown. Maybe not so suited to boozy couples and friends who want a bit more buzz but perfect for us. Just bring a shawl as aircon can get a bit cold

The Barnacles restaurant at the Shangri-La is more than worth a visit: from start to finish it is almost flawless. Not to mention the location - next to Siloso beach. You will have access to a wide variety of salads, main courses and desserts. Whether you are a fish or meat lover, you should find something you like or love...Pretty much every single dish is perfectly cooked and tastes great.It is also a great destination for kids since the brunch allows you to enjoy the pool and comes with a few children activities as well.The Shangri-La Rasa resort might be quite far from the city but you should not regret your trip there. Unfortunately this brunch comes at quite a hefty price but this seems to be an unstoppable trend when it comes to Sunday brunches in 5-star hotels in SingaporeIf you can afford it I highly recommend the Sunday Garden Party at Barnacles

Excellent choice of buffet food which is very tasty. The chef also prepared a few special brunch items, for some of our vegetarian friends, as we had requested for this when we made the reservation. From starters to main-course and from cheese to desserts, we had a huge range of choices for everything we wanted to eat. The setting is absolutely relaxed, right next to the sea front and with a few peahens roaming in the front yard of the restaurant. We had a few family friends with kids and the kids enjoyed the magic show, the balloon toy making, swimming pool and other activities. Perfect way to start a weekend. This place is no longer called Barnacles and is now officially called "Atmosphere By The Sea"

I was impressed by the view looking out towards the sea. It made this restaurant have a fresh and nice ambiance
5
this restaurant had been renamed to Atmosphere. We had a fantastic dinner and the best steak we have had in a very long time. Cooked perfectly and you could of cut it with a butter knife
5
Nicely presented on a super platter included lobster, clams, prawns, fish, delightful experience. One of a few venues to dine at this hotel.
5
This restaurant is lovely well decorated and the food is of good quality the service impeccable and not that expensive. Advised to book gets full really quickly !
4
We had the lunch buffet and although its not cheap, its well worth it, there is so much selection and everything we had was delicious...whatever you do, save room for desert
4
The Sunday brunch buffet used to be $38 in the days before when it was called sharkeys. Now it's over $150. It's far too expensive. The food is good but there are other alternatives along east coast park or dempsy road for better seafood.

For full review & photos, please visit: http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2014/09/crab-ah-at-atmosphere-by-sea-shangri.htmlThis place has changed the name to "Atmosphere By The Sea"The Crab dinner was held during sunset on the waterfront of the South China Sea on Every Friday - 6.30pm to 9.00pm. Service here was quite good and the food was nice and served fast! As the whole place is non-airconditioned, i suggest just wear in casual so that you can enjoy the dinner comfortably. Though the crabs are not that much, but with the appetiser, side dishes, array of desserts & Free flow of Beer + Wine will definitely make you very full. Overall it's a very delightful & unique experience, so do bring your date to enjoy this crab ah dinner and the beautiful sunset together. Happy dining! :-

After reading reviews of my friend on her blog, we decided to go to Barnacles Restaurant. I was impressed by the view looking out towards the sea. It made this restaurant have a fresh and nice ambiance. Seafood was cooked excellent. Drinks were also delicious. Staff was friendly and professional. I really love everything of this place. Highly recommend. I'm sure I will come back here in the future

We make a reservation to dine at their Sunday brunch as I have Shang vouchers from my business trip. The spread of food is resonable but the quality is definitely top-notch. Oysters are kept fresh as they do not opened too many at one time. There are good selection for children too. Best of all, there are activities to keep the children occupied when the adults are dining.After the sumptous buffet, which ends at about 2 pm, you may proceed to the pool which is complementary for all diners at the sunday brunch. The pool has enought slides and play area to keep the children occupied

The food was great at this place. We ordered chicken satay, tiger prawns and some SIngapore slings. I wasn't a huge fan of the service - seemingly there was some renovation work on and all the restaurants were using the same kitchen. But the weird part about it was that we were dining when it wasn't even rush hour. The food was slow in coming and we were offered no explanations as to the delay until we asked
5
Had a lovely meal overlooking the sea. Should probably book if you want an outside table. Seafood cooked perfectly. Although wines expensive but that is just the norm for Singapore .
5
Not hugh range of meals but what we had was sublime. Fast and attentive service and delighful view of sea if sitting outside.
5
We celebrated my fathers 60th here and the service and food were amazing. Sit outside and enjoy the boats on the horizon
4
Went there a couple of times and the service and ambiance is always nice. I always get a table outside in the shade because I don't like the interior design. Food is OK but, like everywhere in Singapore, a bit too expensive.

Barnacles is a seafod grill restaurant located in the grounds of the Shangri-la resort on Sentosa island in Singapore.It has both indors and outdoors dining and opens only for dinner. The best place is to sit outside under the shade of a giant tree, that frames the view over the South China Sea and the very busy sea lanes and the port. Time your visit so you can experience the sunset as you dine, the view is sublime as is the food.My wife and I tried a seafood salad, scallops and and avocado tartar for starters, which we then followed with delicious grilled sea bream and salmon, all of it accompanied by a bottle of white riesling wine, a Dr Loosen from Germany, which was superb.The only small hickup was that the staff, although eager to please, was not trained well and thus the service was not up to the quality of the venue or its great food.Nevertheless, the restaurant is well worth a visit as its combination of venue and food is unique.As for the price, it is reasonable for Singaporean standards, not cheap but well worth the expenditur

Barnacles in Rasa Sentosa Resort is a lovely place for a romantic evening dinner by the sea. I've been here on 2 separate occasions, once for the Sunday Buffet Brunch and once for its Ala Carte menu. The spread for the buffet brunch wasn't fantastic but it didn't need to be. The lead must be its seafood including Alaska crabs and fresh Oysters. My guest and I had such a feast on them alone we didn't have much room left for the others. If you come in the evening, ask to be seated outside - i think they would even seat you at the lawn on busy weekends - the view is stunning and if you have young kids accompanying, they would love to run around at the field just beside the restaurant

Lovely environment Quiet end of Sentosa.Delicious food at value for money .I mean seriously, I am quite happy with the quality of food served.And cannot understand how some can complain about its prices.Of cos it is something not you can dine everyday.For events/ occasions and celebrations.Have at least visited and enjoyed every visit - 12 times and more
5
Barnacles restaurant is absolutely incredible. With seafront views from the Shangri La Rasa Sentosa Resort on Sentosa Island, overlooking the ships on the horizon, the food is delicious. They have the biggest prawns you'll ever see, and everything is fresh and cooked to perfection. The service is also excellent.I'm not surprised it's ranked #16 out of all restaurants in Singapore, and I'm actually surprised it isn't higher up
5
This is a treat from the co. & we enjoyed it thoroughly. The seafood served are amazingly fresh & the crabs are amazingly sweet!! The service staff are amazingly helpful & they are always smiling. Oh, remember to make room for desserts as they are not to be missed. Btw, this is not fine dining, its buffet, so, make sure you bring yr appetite to the table

I brought my family there for dinner and it was a fantastic experience, they are very generous with serving their free fresh bread. Their seafood and lobster pasta is really good, my son enjoyed his steak as well.The servers are very polite, making us feel so welcome and they try to make small talk with my kids - alerting them that the peacock is just behind and there's laughters all around.They even informed me of which credit card promotion they are having upon payment.My tip is to make your booking around 6.30 so that you can enjoy the nightfall by the beach too.Great experience, thanks guys
5
Freindly and attentive staff. Excellent if you like seafood. Lovely atmosphere at night. Would recommend.
5
Had a nicest dinner ever! They have great staff and also live music! A band moves from table to table singing songs. Definitely choose tables outside (if the weather allows) as the view is to die for
5
The food was very nice and the situation of the restaurant simply breath taking.
5
It's never easy finding a place suitable for celebrations. Views - check. Excellent food - check. Ambience - check. Service - check.Tips: Though we sat inside, I looked with envy at those outside. Yes it was a hot and humid Singapore night but if dressed suitably the combination of sea breeze, dusk sky, BBQ platters and candle-lit tables can't be topped. Order the seafood platter (hot) for 2. More tha satisfying.

Choose the Yin & Yang starter - delicious prawn mayo and crispy squid.Loved their free bread basket with the good variety and awesome chili crab dip.Sit indoors if you want to avoid mosquito bites.The Barnacles Mixed Grill was great and you can share it with one other person. They have roving singers.But staff do not refill water promptly
5
We ate again at Barnacles at the Rasa Sentosa Singapore on Saturday, after deciding not to eat at The Knolls at the Capella, where we were staying. Great decision! The food is always consistently good, and the setting - surrounded by grass and beautifully-lit trees, the sea literally a few uninterrupted feet away - is always great. It's also one of the few nice, quiet places in Singapore that you can let your kids run around without fear of anything roaring around a corner.We usually have the mixed grill, steak or chicken when we're here - but the seafood is also terrific. Kudos to the chefs and management for doing a great job - keep it up

My family's favorite place for dinner in sentosa . We really love the location and ambience . It is by the sea and thus you can dine under the stars with sea breeze . The food is just average and price is on the higher side .

We stayed 4 nights at the Shangri La Hotel on Sentosa. We were originally put off the hotel restaurants as they all seemed to be buffet style over the weekend, including Barnacles. On our last night we ventured back for a meal outside in the gardens overlooking the waterways full of ships. We all chose a chargrilled lobster on ravioli with mushrooms and truffle oil. Terrific flavours and half a small sweet lobster each. We added greens and to my amazement my adult children chose broccoli! Service was very good and there was a good selection of cocktails and wines. We shared 2 dessert platters which came with delicious items such as a small pot of creme brûlée, profiteroles filled with mango icecream, chocolate fondant cake, fruit etc. A 4 piece band moved amongst the patrons singing various kitsch songs which I'm sure anyone over 60 would have enjoyed. Tables well spaced, so even annoying parties were not too close. Priced according to top hotel prices, but as in all of Singapore, still relatively cheap compared to Australian and especially Melbourne restaurants of similar ilk. A very pleasant night
4
Good variety of food especially with the different theme nights. Something for everyone I would think. Was good to have the choice of indoor or outdoor seating. Lovely children's area with coloured cutlery and plates and a range of food at children's level. Great for any meal of the day but especially good to have breakfast included in the tariff

We were staying in Sentosa on holiday so thought we'd visit the Shangri La and have dinner. It was a Tuesday night and the place was very quiet so we got a great table with a great view.The service really was terrible. We waiting and waited for menus, then waited again for water, waited for our wine and then a 20 minute wait for our food. Don't understand the problem as there were only a few tables. Must have been on island time that night
