Have been eating here regularly for 5-6 years. The Pork Ribs soup is of very high standard. The meat is still attached to the bone and el-dente, not falling off from over cooking.The soy sauce trotters is tender and not too fat. The skin of their (so called) "black fish" peels off in one large piece and the flesh is tender. 3 elderly ladies serves customers efficiently. Place and tables are rather dingy during peak hours, but this is the fault of the Food Center's cleaners

Gone down to have breakfast in Ang Mo Kio, this stall had opened for 30+ years now. The most challenging part is to get a seat at this hawker centre with patrons hovering you when you are able to finish your meal.Besides the signature bak kut teh, try the braised claypot pork trotters and the signature fish. The stall also serve Chinese tea in these small Chinese teacups. Breakfast here makes my day anytime
