We sat out on the terrace, facing the sea, enjoying the nice breeze and the view over the ships, occasionally interrupted by visitors to the bar walking over to take selfies. Odd flavours, too much salt.
2
We visited the Sky bar and felt we wasted our money. Over rated and overpriced. If you want the views, go to the MBS Skydeck. Don't waste your money to this scam
5
Staffs were excellent in service, time needed for the food to be served was totally worth it. Would visit again.
2
Just try to book and they ask me for my credit card copy front and back by email,with all the scam around the web I’ll not give my things around like this,for the place you are should find another solution

Don't recommend to visit this restaurant. Everything was bad - ordered food, smell of glass, service... Please don't waste your money, much better to prepare dinner at home.

We went up to see the view and decided to stay as it was late. We asked for a window but we were told they were reserved. It was irritating that none of the tables with views was used, especially as the meal was excellent. We left as the restaurant closed, I can only guess they wanted to clear from the windows back.
4
Went there for the views and decided to make dinner out of it. The views are great and there are ways to experience them without diner. There is a ticket option which gives access to the bar. We had a drink at the Club before we went to the restaurant. Two glasses of Champagne for US$ 60. That is very pricey but then, have a look around where you are! The service was great and we also received a bowl of bar snacks. After that we went over to the restaurant and the good service continued. The menu had a few different choices and I think there is something for everyone. We decided to share a few starters. They where all very good and there are no complains about the food. We also decided to have a different selection of wines by the glass. Nice wines and again, the service was great. We had a fantastic view over the Garden by the Bay and enjoyed the Light-show there. The atmosphere was great and I would go again. One thing to remember is the price, it is very pricey. But if it wouldn’t be, I am sure the place would be packet with people blocking the best tables with a mineral water all night and I wouldn’t have the opportunity to enjoy diner with such a view. Just the view is worse paying for.

The restaurant has heaps of potential and left us extremely disappointed. Food very mediocre, service non existent and no atmosphere!!! Bar was extremely busy and waited 30mins just to order a drink then another 20mins to get it and we only ordered a beer and a water !!!
5
360 view did not disappoint, best part was the friendly service and smiles specially from Jewel, she was friendly, attentive, so nice taking a picture to capture me. Loved the infinity pool, wine glass and all, cheers Ce La Vi Kudus on having a jewel like JEWEL!!
4
We paid the $20.00 fee to go up to see the view and it included a credit for a drink. We ordered a bottle of wine so it didn't quite cover the cost but we felt it was worth seeing the view. We had a very nice time drinking, visiting and looking over Singapore. I took some awesome pictures so I'm glad we went up for drinks
3
Whilst the service and staff were great, we were put off by the excessive price tag of everything. Certainly wouldn't go back
4
The experience at Ce La Vi was very good. The staff were excellent and the meal was delicious. Everything went to plan. Highly recomend it.
5
Went with customer and customer loved the views absolutely. Served by John Zhai whom went out of his way to make sure that we had a great experience.
5
We wanted to see the views from the Marina Bay Skypark but realized we’d rather see them with a drink in hand. You can pay $20 per person to go up to the bar/restaurant but it is credited towards food or drink which was wonderful. The drinks were great and food was yummy too! This is a nice alternative to the Skypark.
5
My wife and I took our friend to Ce La Vi as this is our friend’s first visit to Asia and Singapore. It was a perfect day, weather wise, and the views are spectacular...but that’s why people go to this place. And we got very lucky in having Jini being our server. She is very friendly and professional and made our visit a memorable one. Kudos also to Prince who makes a mean martini. So if can sit in Jini’s section and have Prince make your cocktails, you’re in for a great time
5
Don’t miss this fabulous restaurant atop the Marina Sand Hotel! The view is spectacular. We were with friends on a National Geographic Expedition and a fellow passenger happened to be the owner of Ce La Vi! We had an exceptional dinner and top notch beverages. Perfect evening! No to be missed
4
It was a sparkling, shimmering, splendid night for all of us with lovely city and the CBD view. The food was delicious, the steak was superb and the service was just right that evening. We had to pay S$20 each at the entrance and we have been issued with vouchers for the same value which we could redeem to buy drinks or food. I have expected that the food and drinks will be pricey but what is not right was that the guests of the restaurant are not allowed to go to the main viewing deck. If the guests were seated next to the balcony then they’re lucky to have the view in front of them, if not, then you’ll have to wait if there’s a vacant area to enjoy the view and capture some photos

I have mixed comments here. We had read up on the reviews and there were many different comments made but this is the one night my husband and I thought we would treat ourselves while in Singapore and see for ourselves. It's quite windy if your dining outside (which makes sense being so high up) so ladies make sure you take something to wrap around yourself.The service was excellent and our entrees of Mushroom dumplings, pork, chicken and prawn dumplings were lovely. I was advised with the dishes I had picked out we're apparently quite spicy and I don't do chilli at all, they didn't give me a choice of making these mild so I stuck with the safe option and went for an eye fillet steak which my husband also order. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his meal but I was very disappointed with mine, it's not the biggest of steaks and although it was very tender I found it quite fatty and sinewy so by the time this was cut out didn't leave me with much and having ordered Med-Well done it was very under cooked.It doesn't come with too much extra's so you'll need to order a couple of side dishes.Be prepared as it's very expensive but if you've done your research you should already know that so really your paying over the top for the view.My second disappointing thing is your dining outdoors in this flashy restaurant and not more than 3 metres away on the next level down you've got all the tourists etc wandering around looking up at you, this doesn't make for a romantic night at all. Also we wished to go down onto that platform area after dinner to get a better night view and we were told we were not allowed there with out going back down stairs to purchase a ticket to allow us onto that level. We just paid nearly $300.00 for a meal so you would think the restaurant would pass this on to allow you to also take in more of the views
5
This is a must to go up here at least for the view. Professional staff who knows how to make deliscious drinks. Panoramic wiew of the city. Can be windy because of the heigt but nice breeze
3
Nice views and nice restaurant. Was visit for business purpose with Australian guys. Foods are so so onl
5
The food, drinks and service was excellent. Special thanks to Ms. Jane and Ms. Suzette for they made our dining experience extra special.. Highly recommended will def come back there..
5
We treated ourselves to dinner on the last night of our 5 week holiday to Singapore and Australia before flying home. We were not disappointed. The staff and Manager could not have been nicer to us. When they found out it was our last night of our holiday they offered us a table overlooking the Bay Gardens on Super Trees. It was stunning! Watching the sun go down over the harbour bay and then to have a beautiful view of the light and music show of the Super Trees was just out of this world! With a huge thank you to our waitress, Olivia, for the beautiful table - you certainly spoiled us. The food was a delight and Olivia arranged for our desserts to include 'Have a safe trip home' piped on it. The whole experience was in our minds worth every cent. We will not forget it and we certainly want go back which we will
5
Too much crowded..the view of the cityscape was amazing..we managed to find a table for us after almost 15 minutes... ordered sushi and 2 drinks.. enjoyed the views with the crowd...i think the best time to go there just before the sunset so one can find a good table outside with a good view..the staffs are good and smart just needs some smile on their faces ..they adjust the 40s$ admission with my bill.. overall,a must visit for travellers..
5
The view from the Marina Bay Sands 57th floor is fantastic, as everybody says.On top of this, Ce La Vi offers an excellent food and a very nice service.Besides, we were able to have dinner and talk! Not noisy, at least where we were.Will come back
4
excellent view and food! MARIA BAY SANDS 57th floor ce la vi.EXCELLENT view and weather.Singapoe becomes dark a little bit late.I took photos around 7:15pm
5
I would like to commend rohana hamis for serving my cake without any charges . Thanks for the 12++ waive. You did a good job I am happy at this restaurant 
4
Average price for 2 is around S$200 The place is fantastic with a great view of the city. Little overpriced but justified considering all rooftop places are generally expensive around the world.The only drawback is the staff with a lot of attitude. It's actually a big negative for the place and just ruins the evening. If you ignore the staff and try to enjoy your visit, I highly recommend this place in Singapor
5
CE LA VI has a terrific view to offer since its located in Marina Bay Sands's 57th floor. I went there to see a sunset, and I recommend to have the front seating to enjoy the sunset rather than in bar area. The mocktail was just okay, I had Markisa mocktail that afternoon. All were paid by the view and the vibes it selfs. After enjoying the sunset, I went to the restaurant which also in the same area of the bar. To dine in the restaurant, you have to make a reservation first. And of course, ask for the outside table! I had shrimp dumplings and tuna sushi for a starter. Lambchop, and rib eye were the main course for the dinner. Overall the quality is just okay, the food was tasty enough, but the main attraction is the view and the ambiance
5
First of all, I like the name of the restaurant, a play on the popular French expression. The views are spectacular as this restaurant is at the end (the bow?) of the shiplike structure atop the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The service was good and the food was excellent
5
You have 2 choices when visiting the skywalk at marina bay sands. Pay $23 to visit the viewing platform on level 56 or pay $20 to go to level 57 with a bar . Your $20 entry fee then goes towards food and drink. Great value with a magnificent view of Singapore and surrounds. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Singapor
2
Too bad. The orange juice is fake. You would expect at least a 100% fruit juice for S$ 12 instead of a fruit juice drink with sugar and water added. Staff did change my drink but not without a hassle.
4
The view speak for itself. Great service great drinks. Personally felt that if the finger food were more delicious, 5stars will not be an issue.
3
This review is for the outside lounge area. You are charged $20 to gain access to the restaurant and you can apply the charge towards food and drinks. The food was not good at all. The service was bad. Just go for the views and have a drink. A very touristy place but the views are fabulous
3
The views this restaurant offers are superb, the food is very good, however it let's itself down by the service with which everything is presented.To start with the fact you have to queue and share an elevator with any Tom, Dick or Harry who is going up to the views means an unenjoyable wait to get to the restaurant.Upon arriving for our booking of 3 we were shown to our table. After 10 minutes of waiting we finally managed to get the waiter's attention to ask if we could have a drink, he said that he thought a 4th was arriving and that was why he had not been over - which is pretty poor even if you think a 4th is coming but particularly when the booking was clearly for 3. When the drinks did arrive (about 25 minutes after our arrival) we were then choosing food from the menu and despite clear instructions that we wished for the two starters we had ordered as a main to arrive as a main, they arrived as a starter. Any attempt to get a subsequent bottle of wine was met with some confused faces that indicated no-one knew who was responsible and consequently we had a further wait for drinks.Overall the view, the food, was very good but it let's itself down as whilst the staff are pleasant, they seemed to have no idea of what or how to do perform their roles and given the price premium you pay for eating here, it deserves better.It is frustrating when you consider how easy it would be with a few small changes to make this restaurant outstanding
4
View, surroundings and ambience. 5/5Price was very expensive and didn’t include tax or service which was added on at the end. 3/5Booking was ok but we couldn’t book more than a month in advance. 3/5Cleanliness. 5/5Staff were friendly and professional, but our waiter changed and we had to explain the allergy all over again which we’re not sure she understood. 4/5Tolerance of special requests was lacking as we informed very far in advance about one diner being gluten free and despite this, they could not give him any of his top choices due to pre-made mixes. We expected more flexibility from such an expensive high class restaurant. 2/5Variety on the menu was limited with not many appealing options compared to other similar restaurants in the area. 2/5Bathrooms. 5/5We wanted to take pictures of the amazing view but weren’t allowed outside the small gated area we were seated in and were stopped by security. After spending a small fortune on the meal, this was insulting and a disappointing end to the evening. 1/

Spend my anniversary celebration over at CE LA VI restaurant , ambience was awesome and staff are really nice and friendly . But food wise , not fantastic though .I actually ask the staff to take photo of me and my bf quite a few times and the are really proactive . They even gave me a surprise that I least expected , the staff came with the Polaroid camera and ask the both of use to smile for a picture . I didn’t think much , but shortly after they present a card with out picture and they hand written blessing for knowing us celebrating our anniversary . I actually got food poison after 1 day , doctors mention it could because of the raw food i ate, and the only raw food between the days was the raw scallops and oyster from the restaurant . Nevertheless , I’m stil a satisfied customer for the effort of the cards and staff service .

We enjoyed a family lunch last week and were really impressed by the service and quality of food. Most of us chose the set menu and were certainly not disappointed. It was absolutely delicious and served by very attentive wait staff. We highly recommend the whole package - meals, drinks, and the amazing view
5
Booked this restaurant for my partners birthday dinner and received exceptional service, special mention to Rita. My partner was thrilled to receive the complimentary sweets platter for his birthday. Definitely made it a memorable night!
5
Lovely way to see the city...you can pay to go to the observation deck our you can pay $20 to go to Ce La Vi and get a $20 voucher for the bar. Drinks/good are expensive but the view is amazing.
5
We have just had lunch at Ce La Vi at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and could not have had a better table and view. We chose the set menu and really enjoyed the prawns, but wish we had more than 2 each.I would recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner and hope to return before we head home.The cocktails were also very good in the bar and I imagine the bar is better at night
4
Great view, great experience.
Food isn’t too of the town but is good expeirenxe for a 1 time visit specifically with a group. Had drinks to start with and may return for that.
5
Excellent service by Rita, world class food! Only main dishes could have been a little warmer, but taste wise close to perfection
4
While vacationing, we had enjoyed a dinner at the open terrace of the top floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the Cé La Vi restaurant. The view was great, even though it was dark - plenty of lit buildings and landmarks to admire. The service was friendly and good. Nothing wrong with the food either, just not maybe memorable, as I can not recall what I ate. A salad to start with and a curry of some sorts
4
food is average, but view is great from the top and ambiance is good. Service is also efficient and thoughtful, so the value you are paying for are probably the rest of the positives but definitely not for the foo
5
This place is amazingly vibrant with an awesome view of Singapore skyline. if you'r in Marina Bay Sands, this is a must visit for you
5
Defined will go there for the good service and ambiance. Feeling the top of the world and everything you can talk about with your friends. I got nice view for selfies.
4
Se La Vi Restaurant on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands has very good food, is very crowded, and a great view of Singapore if you are not fighting people coming up to the Bar for a drink and to see the view. You buy tickets based on what you want to see and do at this destination. 3 options. For the best tables with a view with dinner, make a reservation a head of time. You can get a small glimpse of the light shows from the botanical garden and the marina show but can’t really see or appreciate them. Sunsets can be stunning on the right nights. Worth a visit.
3
A fun evening just to experience the iconic location. Food was average, and just about every dish arrived luke warm, so considering the high prices (paid S$455 for 3 people with one bottle of wine) it was a little disappointing....apart from the spectacular views, especially with an electrical storm happening not far off. Cocktails at the bar were underwhelming too considering the prices (I think around S$27 for the cheapest once tax and service are added). Maybe worth going once for the experience, but it sounds as if lunch would be a better value option
4
My partner and I booked a table at Ce la vie as we where fascinated by the Marina Bay Sands and wanted to experience everything it had to offer.We initially booked at the hotel reception desk and the process was extremely easy and the service very warm and friendly.Overall we where not to impressed when we arrived and where shown to a very busy bar before our table was ready. We bought cocktails and waited to squeeze in through a crowd of people to get a view of the city and the lightshow.After being shown to out table we had a drink at the restaurants bar which was very pleasant the cocktails where beautifully presented and equally tasty.The food was beautiful and arrived promptly, service equally as good.The food was not the best part of our experience all in all the atmosphere was wonderful and I enjoyed the whole experience. Only down side I found the seating uncomfortable, we where sat very close to other couples eating their food
4
Great place for a drink and beautiful view of Singapore and harbor. As son sets this is a romantic place for dinner but alas the food is ordinary although my wife liked the fish. The lamb was OK but nothing special. Drinks and food are expensive but the view is worth the price
2
Ambiance is nice but no view because we were sitting inside. Food was horrible especially the cod with lentils, very strong shrimp paste.
4
Expensive place (minimum 20$ purchase) which equals to a drink/beer before tips. However, view of the city at night is magic. Highly recommend it just for the view and a nice drink.
5
great ambience, great food and excellent services. Denise was meticulous towards serving my table. I'm very impressed that she will take the initiative to ensure the table is clean after each course. Very friendly. Definitely makes the dining experience a great one.
4
Relatively good food. Nice interiors. Good atmosphere. Easy to book. The view... can’t do better thank this!

We visited this restaurant on the last day of our stay in Singapore and it was a truly fitting finale to a 3.5 week trip to Australia and New Zealand with a 2 night stopover in Singapore en route back to the UK. There were 6 of us and lunch was booked through our hotel concierge. We could not afford to stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel but the lunch gave us access for a couple of hours to taste the high life. It was an excellent lunch with food of high quality. We all ate from the standard set lunch menu and all the food delivered to the table was excellent. Drinks prices were reasonable given the location with a glass of wine at 16 S$ and beer at 20 S$ for a pint, both of which were in excellent condition. The restaurant was quiet which allowed us to move around and take pictures of the Bay Area and the City. I would recommend going for lunch here rather than paying the ticket price to access the observation deck. The views are the same and for the extra cost you get some great food. The set lunch menu is 38 S$ for two courses and 48 S$ for thee courses. We went for the three courses and we had a great lunch experience in a fantastic location at the top of one of the worlds most iconic hotels. As is normal in Singapore, all prices above are subject to 10% service charge and 7% Sales Tax but no tip was given nor expected.
5
My wife and I spent a fabulous evening yesterday at this spectacular restaurant. The views are stunning. The staff were attentive and so friendly it felt like we were really special. The drinks were great. Brian the bar tender on the outside bar makes one of the best cosmopolitans we have ever had. The food was wonderful. I had the sea bream curry which was so flavoursome I could have eaten it again. My wife had the roast chicken with chilli glaze and she said it was one of the nicest meal she had ever had. The DJ played some fantastic background sounds . All in all a wonderful evening and well worth every penny
5
We went there for our wedding anniversary on 1/12/17. Seated at bar first and enjoyed some great cocktails and the view as the sky darkened and the lights sparkled. Our table was on the outside terrace overlooking Gardens by the Bay and it was such an amazing view and ambience. Even though there were a few tables nearby you never felt intruded upon. Service was excellent and the food and wine pairings excellen
5
We had a lunch in this restaurant, the view was amazing, service is fabulous Ryan was very attentive and he delivers excellent service!! The manager Suzette was amazing too!! Ryan did try his best to pleased my little boy as he is fussy with the foods which is extraordinary! thank you and will come back again next time we stays in marina
4
Had my birthday dinner there with my hubby. The food was good and so was the service too. We were served by Ms Rita who was attentive and super friendly. She has a lovely smile that made us feel so welcomed. The dinner ended with a complimentary cake from Ce La Vi which was a surprise for me. It was really very sweet of them. I like their service and will definitely visit again.
1
Nice scenery and outstanding view. Restaurant itself was delivering an uncomfortable service. It was cold, two different music in the background. Special menu was not special chicken was not well cocked. Food was not warm, unbelievable fast delivery no time to drink the the wine. No next time for us. .
5
Hands down, the best meal I have eaten in my life. My husband and I were blown away. The food was utterly delicious. We enjoyed an outdoor table with a spectacular view. Simply, you would be mad not to try it.
4
Only stopped by for a drink, but still had an amazing time checking out the views from the roof top bar. The prices are a little steep, but I would definitly recommend checking this out if you are in the Marina Bay area.
5
What a view...Love the ambience. The food is fantastic and the service is absolutely great.
Excellent for business dinners and family celebrations...
5
Beautiful setting, amazing views, lovely cocktails and great food. You couldn't ask for more! :)
May our Waitress was so helpful and organised a change of table for us when asked. They were all very professional.
5
Enjoyed for the third time dinner on top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Great view, great drinks, great atmosphere. There were able to accommodate outside seating every time I requested it! I love the option to swing by at the night club with the same name as a combination with my dinner reservation. Great value for the money
4
iguess you have to go in the sky in Singapore. Its spectular view with very good food, but the drinks do cause a bad taste value wise. Its the best food at that height with those views. Bucket list tick here.Go for the food, enjoy the view, do it, you mus
4
Can't argue about the awesome view, even on the rainy day we visited. Service was quick on a half full floor and they handled little Miss 11's fussy tastes well by suggesting a good alternative when she didn't like the set menu. Good prawn khatifi and chicken dishes. Nice wine suggestions from sommelier too. Definitely book in advance - this place is popular
4
Reserved for a romantic dinner for two. Staff was friendly and accommodated our request to wait a bit with our dinner until a table in a nicer location, with better view of the gardens and the sea was available. Food was average and our Singapore Sling could have packed a bit more of a punch, but the experience was good. The place is pretty busy though and I think some evenings a DJ is playing tunes in the background ..
4
You need to book this on line else you are at the mercy of someone leaving a table for you to grab - not a bad option but don't try this over the weekend. The online booking is efficient - replies are received usually within a day. The main caveat is rain though - since the reservation is useless if it rains - you are shifted inside which is not such a super experience. Nice meal with select options but well prepared. Clearly the coolest place in town (literally as well !!) with the best views so cross your fingers for the rain and do that booking

My family and I went there last week for dinner. I booked in advance a day before by making a reservation on the spot. I left my name, number of people, phone number and email, and didn't get a call back by the end of the night. So I called again to make sure the booking is confirmed, but the staff said they have no record of my name and booking which was weird and irritating at the same time. On that same phone call I made a second booking, splitting the tables into two because they couldn't fit 13 people at the same long table. We finally got there the day after the chaos of trying to get a reservation at Ce La Vi. Staff at the restaurants were much nicer. We ordered Crispy Prawn Tempura, Romaine Heart Salad with Miso Dressing, Boneless Korean Fried Chicken Wings, Salt & Szechuan Pepper Crispy Squid, and Freshly Shucked Atlantic Oysters for starters. And for the mains, we had Prawn & Scallop Young Coconut Stew, Braised Garoupa – Sour & Spicy Tomato Reduction, Grilled Snapper with Lemongrass Turmeric & Kecap Manis, Nyonya Spiced Lamb Chops, and Cast Iron Roasted Rangers Valley “Black Market” Ribeye.The Ribeye was so so good! I finished everything on the plate. The meat was juicy and tender, perfectly seasoned, just yum!! I tried the Lamb Chops but it wasn’t the gretest chops I’ve had, it had an interesting taste which unfortunately I wasn’t really into. It was tender too, though, so that was good. The Grilled Snapper was okay. Salt & Szechuan Pepper Crispy Squid was so tasty, crunchy and the texture wasn't rubbery, I loved it.We ordered juice and other drinks that never came so we had to cancel the order. I guess that was the only let down after the horrible experience of trying to get a table there. You need to make sure you double-check your booking in advance, even triple-check if necessary! The view of Singapore skyline was a huge plus if you were seated next to the big glass window, or outside. Overall it was a nice experience and remember to order the Ribeye if you’re planning to dine at Ce La Vi
4
went there for a drink with the nightview was stunning. the services was really nice.Price are quite resonable.
5
Breathtaking views of Clarke Quay, Bay Gardens and Marina Bay. Nice atmosphere with variety to choose from. 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
4
Fancy and expensive food, in a chic ambient. Tables are quite to close to each other for my preference. The view is amazing, try to be there before sunset.
4
Very good food excellent collection of wine and cocktails great views from outside a reservation prior is must
5
Excellent view, ambiance, food and made more pleasurable by service of Shin Yien.
Made the special occasion more memorable!!!
5
We went there for a drink and were amazed by the view that you could enjoy. If you are at Marina Bay you should definitely take a drink there.
4
We chose to have the set lunch plus a cocktail each. Just to bear in mind what type of water you require - asked for still & a bottle was quickly opened & poured before I realised that it was not tap water so of course had to pay for that as well. Cocktails were good, & the food served was delicious & displayed well! Overall plus the view was successful for the four of us.
5
We came here for dinner as part of our honeymoon. The food was outstanding and our server May was fantastic, very attentive and professional. We loved our meal and the special touches the staff added as they knew it was our honeymoon. The view was an added bonus.It was a little annoying having people from the bar come into the restaurant (behind the barrier) and stand around us taking photos. Some people got uncomfortably close.
4
Location location location! And the view was awesome! Way up there, and the infinity pool as a gem just right Next to it, it is no wonder that the place attracts a crowd. The food then? Tasty and a nice presentation, pleasant staff too - and Yeah it is a bit pricey... but you are not Only the food you pay fo
4
This place is crowded, so if you are not the type that enjoys dark places crammed with people, stay away . For the rest of us, as the night progresses, the atmosphere gets progressively electric. At any point be prepared that someone will spontaneously break into a dance and be joined by random others. Make sure that you order your refills well in advance,they can take upto 15 minutes to be served A place to see and be see
4
Very nice view from Top. Had some pizza and beers while enjoy the view and wind. Quite crowded during school holidays.
5
Perfect view on the rooftop of Marina Bay Sands. Thank you to the good food and service, and special thanks to the perfect waitress Rita!
5
The waitress(Shin Yien) ,that hosted us for the night was extremely well mannered and the service over there was extremely well too.Everything about the restaurant was fantastic ,especially the food.😍
1
Wouldn't bother going up here. Drinks and food are not worth the money. The view is good but we much preferred the view at the bar on the Supertree in Gardens by the Bay as you get the same view with the addition of being able to see Marina Bay Sands as well. The service here was dire. Not at all what you'd expect from this hotel. The toilets were a dive too. Sadly, didn't live up to the hype
1
The restaurant is not worth a visit. The views are indeed great, however the food and the service leave a lot to be desired. It is very tourist oriented and the food is mediocre, nothing bad but definitely nothing worth coming back for.It was a very disappointing experience and I would definitely not be visiting again.
5
CE LA VI Restaurant and Bar is one of the best sky bars in Singapore. The ambiance is so nice and the staff is so friendly and welcoming. They always make sure their guests are well taken care of and extremely satisfied. The bar is located at the 57 th floor of Marina Bay Sands, Tower 3. This will give you a chance to have a great view of Singapore, while enjoying your dinner. I had a great fine dinning experience in CE LA VI during my 29th birthday, Thanks for PJ and Suzette (Executives of the Restaurant and bar) who are always making sure that all the guests are happy and enjoying their time.Definitely I recommend you to visit the place and have a great time

It was definitely worth to exprience this restaurant . The foods and service were excellent furthermore we just turned up without any booking in advance. The waitress Miss Rita has provided an excellent service - showed us around the bar !! Only disadvantage it was a bit too windy but definitely will visit here again on the next trip.Alice United Kingdo

We booked to celebrate New year in Singapore and Ce La Vie was the best place with the sky bar view to celebrate. We had a 6 course dinner with wine pairing.great meal and the service was excellent although it was raining heavy the staff did a great job. PJ was a great hostess. She is moved us quickly to the inside restaurant when the rain started and we had a great time

We had family visiting Singapore so we wanted to take them to Ce la Vi. We went december 25th for the christmas brunch. It was 98 dollars per person, the one with champagne was 198 dollars. The buffet was pretty good, especially the oysters and crab section, the cheese was really good and the dessert as well. It also brought a main course, I ordered the steamed garoupa and didnt like it but I had some of my dads crispy free range chicken and it was pretty good. The roast beef looked yummy as well. The view is incredible, and I recommend this place for Singaporeans first time visitors

Crowded, expensive and limited views as most areas closed off for either hotel guests or meal bookings. Was raining which is often in Singapore, but no effective cover. Seats were wet. Don't waste your money or time going to this place for views or ambience, just pay to go to the viewing dec

We went to bar for a drink and see the view. The ambiance and views are great, however the waiter was very rude, unfriendly and didn’t return our change. We were going to eat in the restaurant but decided to leave.
3
Wonderful location, and worth booking well in advance in order to get an outside table with a view. We had a dramatic thunderstorm half way through dinner and they managed to get us a table inside out of the rain. Food was a bit mixed, with some of the main courses in particular being somewhat underwhelming, and the puddings weren't great. Service was similarly mixed, being slow and confused at times. However, we had a great time and the whole evening was an experience, and it is more of a “destination” restaurant than somewhere to go to for the food. Note that it can take a while to get up to the restaurant in the lifts, and that is even after you have found the separate lift for the bar and restaurant (rather than people just going to have a look at the view)

Great restaurant set atop the iconic Marina Bay Sands building.We ate there a nice December evening and loved it. I frankly expected to be shocked by price and disappointed by the food, but I was neither.Service was outstanding, food was very good and the price... ok it was expensive but I felt it was fair all things considered.I highly recommend
5
Marina Bay Sands is a symbol of opulence and luxury. If you want to experience what is it like to be here do make your way to the Ce La Vi restaurant on the roof top. There is a $20 entry fee but that can be redeemed against your bill in the restaurant. The view from the restaurant is breathtaking - the flyer, the garden as well as the bay and the merlion statue. A must visit for anyone coming here. The food is good too - albeit a bit pricey (as expected)

We had the chance to have dinner in the restaurant during our stay in singapore. At the beginning everything was great: we ordered food that was really good, we drank champagne and Ryan, our waiter, was amazingly kind and complimented us with a dessert for our celebration. Unfortunately Ryan ended his shift so we were left with another waitress. We paid the bill and we left the restaurant. Soon after another waitress chaise us outside of the restaurant asking if we paid. A little confused and disappointed, we answered yes and we suggest her to verify. She kept us waiting while we were much disappointed with time. Form a restaurant of such a kind I do not expect (and definitely do no want) such a behavior. I suggest for the personnel to double check prior to any accusation.

We came here as backpackers as a big treat during our stop in Singapore! It is very pricey if you’re on a budget but reasonable if you’re not! It cost us about £80.00 for a couple of drinks each and a burger each. The views of Marina Bay are unparalleled and the food is pretty decent! Come here for sure! Even if you just come up for a drink to enjoy the views and keep it cheap!
5
We received excellent service from Rita and Denise at Ce La Vi. The Sea food soup I ordered ,was delicious. My wife's fish dish, was also tasty. The drinks were served cold and promptly. The background music was too loud and repetitive not suitable for the age of the patrons. I would recommend the Ce La Vi, as one of the stops for tourists to experience 
4
I went here for Christmas dinner. As expected when doing online booking its quite full and got reservation at 9.15pm. However we decided to come earlier. We sit for awhile and enjoy the view and we got lucky since there is a table ready for us. Food was ok and the portion meant u to do 3 course dinner. They give all the guests candies that night as Christmas gift
3
Our main meals were quite delicious, but no better than what we had eaten anywhere else in Singapore. I ordered the Bombe Alaska for dessert. They didn't burn the alcohol off properly so the whole dessert was sitting in a soggy pool of liquid. I could barely taste the actual dessert behind all that alcohol.The service was exceptional.It's pricey, (obviously, it's Singapore) but you're paying for the view so instead of dining at the restaurant I would instead reserve a table outside at the bar or visit the other side where you pay to get up there and redeem the fee with food/drink vouchers
4
Food mixed, starter fried calamari was forgettable,tasteless (but credited from the bill when we pointed it out), the mains of ribeye steak were good (need a side each as well since the portions are small. The dessert cheese cake mango was exceptionally good.The coffee took forever to arrive, but the views from the 57 th floor made the wait bearable. At s$375 it wasn't cheap but overall value for the experience in an expensive cit
5
I reserved a table a month before my family and I visited because I heard good reviews about this restaurant. True enough, it did not disappoint. We especially loved the Beef Tomahawk and the exemplary service of Sithra. Highly recommended!
5
My family celebrated christmas dinner at ce la vi. The food was great. Everything went well with the help of our lovely and hospitable server, Sithra.
2
We arrived around sunset. The view is terrific but the cocktails were terrible and the music average. The atmosphere is weird with dozens of tourists trundling through. Given the 25 dollar cover charge it didn’t match expectations.
1
So we did like most people did the visit to the Marina bay Sands
Terrible service expensive drinks long wait. Seriously amazing views but that where it stops
Consider your options

The food is good, cooking in Asian style. The apple crumble is amazing..
The atmosphere is cozy for business lunch and the view is magnificent.
5
Went with my wife for a late dinner and we were blast away. The service is impeccable, the food is delightful and the best of all is the sommelier (wine stewart) Abbas, his smile and knowledge is simply stunning. Thanks to him we went thru a great moment as the wine were perfect for the food we were having. We will be back soon again. Thanks to all the team in Ce La Vi ! Keep up the amazing work 
5
This would have to have been my most luxurious meal ever. The food and staff service in the restaurant was worth the pricey tag. The expense of the meal was not so much the food, rather than drinks such as a bottle of Australian wine was in excess of $130 for something we pay $15 for back at home.All that aside we felt it was worth it. The staff were attentive and friendly, the food was outstanding. We decided on two course with dessert. We weren't going to miss dessert.There was some confusion when we first arrived. We purchased tickets to the skydeck (which you have to do if you are not staying at the hotel) and allowed some extra time to take in the views. When we were ready to go into dinner... there was a side entrance from the skydeck to the restaurant but we were not allowed to enter that way. A security guard said we had to go around to the lift and go up a level. But when we got to the lift the girl there said to use the side entrance where the security guard was. But eventually we convinced her to let us go up in the lift.All that aside we enjoyed the resaurant. The bar was very crowded but the staff were good. We did spend some time at the open bar at the other but an electrical storm forced us inside.Access to the skydeck and Ce La Vi is via tower 3 and there is a taxi rank outside.This was a good night out and it was a treat for my mum. We had an awesome dinner and found it well worth the splurge
5
Me and my husband went to Ce La Vi for my birthday. First thing the food was very delicious, second thing the service was excellent. The person who tooke care of our table named Marycel was very awesome with everything. Thank you for the great evening which Ce La Vi provided to us. We will surely come back soon. It is highly recomended. We came here couple of times. When i want to feel special the address is Ce La Vi.
4
Trendy rooftop bar & great vantage point to see Singapore city lit up in the evening. Great vibes.There is a cover charge to take the lift up to Ce La Vie, but that goes towards drinks at the top, so well worth to head up & checkout the venue.It's a very popular spo
5
The most iconic structure in Singapore is the marina Bay Sands hotel and this restaurant is located on itâ€™s roof top adjacent to the best viewing gallery in Singapore. it costs 25 Singapore dollars Per person to get to the viewing deck and once there you can enjoy the food and the amazing variety of drinks at the bar. this place is definitely a must visit when in Singapor
5
Best view from the top. Service was very good. Although the food is pricey but it's good. You can have the best table by the side if you want enjoy the view especially at night with lights every direction....I would visit this place again.
1
Food order n served duration was approximate 1.15hrs! Server was good but kitchen staff was to slow, manpower shortage
4
Very good food! Went there for anniversary celebration and its was a perfect place... However its pretty pricy!
3
The location wise is good, Food was pretty average, was not given the seat i have requested. not really worth the money to go
5
Location Location Location. That's the main thing. The view is breathtaking! I did not eat at the place, it was a work's event
3
This restaurant has terrific views and would be a better place to go for a drink than ‘fine dining’. The food quality for the price is sub par and the wine list lacking in affordable ($150-200) bottles. The servers do their best to cover for the food and are polite and attentive... however in such a great city as Singapore you can do so much better elsewhere
5
Made a reservation online to celebrate husband's birthday. Requested a private table and a view overlooking Singapore's boastful skyline. Staff were amazing in accommodating to my requests. Communication via emails were on point and accurate. The food and drinks were a delight. Our waitress during the early hours of the evening was excellent. To the kind gentleman who surprised my husband with a cake and candle; much thanks to you mate. He was truly happy with the little efforts made by the staff. The view is impeccable and the food is amazing especially their Korean boneless chicken wings (starters). Husband found the oysters to be very fresh. The draught beers however are a bit pricey end $20 each on average. Although it's on the expensive end, the food, service, and company was all worth it. Will return again.

Scene set ! check....Views ! Check....Service! Apparent.....Bar tender named ‘Edison’ watch out for him and don’t let him pour your drinks.....I’m not one to give a bar tender a hard time but paying $16 for a shot of franglico ....And $32 for a double....I tend to look at my glass .....The crook, poured me ‘5’ doubles and only 1 was a double....As stated great place, great sites absolute nose bleed.... altitude and bartenders contributions.....
5
Probably the restaurant with the best views in Singapore! However, C’est La Vi is more than that. Yes, the views are incredible, especially as the sun sets over the city, but the food and ambiance are also great. Our waiter from the Philippines was very courteous, knowledgeable, and he easy to chat with. We was very knowledgeable and our dietary needs (1 gluten free, 1 dairy free) were well catered for, checking with the kitchen where needed. Well worth a visit
5
We went over for a light dinner and drinks, paid SG20 per adult for entrance charge, when asking for our dining bill we gave the entrance charge voucher to have the amount deducted from the total dining charges which all guest get to redeem for paying the cover charge.There is a lounge section, indoor and outdoor dining sections, very relaxing ambience but can be crowded in the late evenings, we enjoyed our food and beverages that we had ordered, above all its the VIEW that you get of the city and gardens by the bay, it was awesome
5
Went for enjoying the views and atmosphere up there over a bar snack and two beers. The fried octopus was delicious finger food. The service professionally friendly. The views unbeatable, of course.
5
We enjoyed our lunch at the Ce La Vi restaurant a few years ago and vowed to return if we ever came back to Singapore, and this we did today, Dec. 16, 2017. The Japanese fare is simple and tasty. The service polite and rapid. Especially our waiter, Paul, who patiently walked me through the menu. My wife had a delicious sushi/sashimi platter and I had a large portion of California rolls. More than enough since we were not very hungry. But to top it off is the magnificent view from this 57th floor restaurant at the Marina Bay Tower 3. If in Singapore, well worth visiting
5
Waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and accompanying wines. Was able to suggest what goes well with each dish. Restaurant caters to your taste and you can ask if you want something less or more spicy etc. The dessert was DELICIOUS and worth every calorie! The views are stunning being on top of the 3rd tower of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The atmosphere is great too. Definitely worth going!TIP: pay $20 entrance fee to go to the drinks bar. The money can be redeemed at the restaurant or bar upstairs. If you go on a Sunday night it's usually quieter and you shouldn't have to wait long to get in to the restaurant. Otherwise you have to pre-book to get a table
5
Second time visiting this place. Always amazing and mesmerizing.The site, the view. The food, the service.Located on the top of Marina Sands hotel and casino its a place to go when in Singapore.It's not cheap but if you are on a low budget you can go up top for a panoramic view
4
This restaurant is a must visit if you are spending time on Singapore. You’ll need to book ahead. The views from the rooftop of this extraordinary hotel are amazing. There’s a cool vibe and it’s good for people watching. The Asian dishes were fine but not as special as expected, hence 4 not 5.
5
Fantastic Meal, food was delicious, wonderful view, excellent service received from Rita the waitress, which enhanced the evening . Rita was very attentive and nothing was too much trouble. Photos were taken for us with the fantastic view in the background, making it a memorable evening for me and my husband.
5
One of my favorite experiences in Singapore. “Ce La Vi” a view looking down you can see the light show “Gardens by the bay”, everything we had ordered was so flavorable. Thanks to Rita for making our experience 10x better than we already been given. Will definitely be back soon
2
I am a regular business dinner host. As a part of that job you learn that the overall impression of a place is often judged by the service you get from people.CE LA VI has an utterly poor service, this is my third try and it was the final.Luckily it was the family and not business.So waiter, with zero multi tasking skills, did not have that needed vision to spot guest waiving for service.He served the starter wine 15 minutes after the starter was served.He served the main course wine 10 minutes after the main was served and only because I complained.The area was not crowded, not many guests, he just wasnt the guy for that job and we had a poor experience of this lunch. My wife certainly made a point of this as a No Go place with business VIPs.I agree. Singapore however is absolutely full of restaurants with the right people on the right jobs
5
This place is just perfect for some lip smacking food with the view of the entire city of Singapore .. was here with my family and the food was delicious . I had ordered for the red snapper , black cod , the rib eye and fried tofu with spinach noodles. This was my first visit here and I’m going to come back whenever in Singapore 
5
CaLaVi is and will be an iconic place to eat, chill, watch and take in spectacular views. Besides the cool vibe and feeling from the fine Libations, the food is tremendous. The Red Snapper and Brisket we fantastic. Service was excellent and not overwhelming, but very accommodating our food allergies(dairy) and so helpful to take in the whole roof top experience. Highly recommend, but make a reservation even for drinks
5
Such a beautiful view and romantic having dinner or chill out with friends or families. Would like to recommended. We love it here. Would like to came back.
5
The food is in the high level, very good. The spirit and the feeling while sitting in the 56th floor create a unique experience. People are nice, good drinks and great view
5
Came up for the view and stopped for lunch, Good decision as the food is lovely and service matches the standard of the hotel it is above
Watch out if you have water as bottled still water was a touch dear
Definitely worth a visit
5
The views of Singapore at night from CE LA VI was fantastic. The Ambiance is superb. The quality and taste of the food was of high standard. Service was outstanding. special mention must be made of Rita who served us she was so efficient, helpful and so pleasant . It was well worth every dollar spen
5
A great place to admire Singapore. It is worth paying the S$20 to sit and have a drink and see the extent of Singapore. Find your way to the Marina Sands Hotel check in counter and ask for the Ce la Vie Restaurant lift. Cocktails are S $23++ (entry voucher can be use to offset the bill.
5
Unlike many places around the world these guys do not trade on the view alone... great food served by friendly staff with fabulous cocktails!Totally worth a visit - book a table for a 6:00 pm seating - pop up a bit earlier grab a cocktail - take some photos - then relax over a nice meal watching the sunset upon Singapore

My adult daughter and I bought vouchers for S$20 each towards drinks/food at Ce La Vie Lounge. We purchased these from the desk on the ground floor of Tower 3 of MBS. The Lounge opens at 12 midday, and as we were two of the first to arrive, we were able to secure a nice, comfortable couch outside with sweeping views of the marina and the city.My daughter and I ordered two mocktails (S$28.00++). We also shared a serve of sushi ($26++) which consisted of 8 large pieces with condiments and was excellent. A complementary serve of very spicy potato chips was also served.We didn't linger too long because the staff started to close the outside area due to a threatening thunderstorm.The service was very friendly and efficient. All in all, a nice relaxing visit
5
We went for a special occasion - and everything went perfect. Table on the more quiet terrace with fantastic views on the Gardens by the sea. Rita, our waitress did a wonderful job. I am a vegetarian and had mentioned this on our reservation (via e-mail). And without asking, I was brought the vegetarian menue. Perfect. And than the food: each of the 3 courses we choose, was perfect. The portions are just right in size - not to big. And the price of the food is okay - what makes it a little pricy are the drinks. We choose a bottle of Pinot Noir from New Zealand. But as I have said: this dinner was worth every cent
4
As we arrived late from our 34h trip we decide to dine at the hotel.The service was impeccable but a little empty as many people decide to eat at the bar area as it has a better view of the Singapore skyline. This restaurant is on the top floor (infinity pool) area.The bar area serves pizza and other dishes which your not allowed to order if you're seated in the restaurant area
5
We went to celebrate a family birthday. Drinks outside where the service was a little slow, but fortunately not in a rush and one lovely waiter took the time to take a nice photo before we went to sit down to dinner. Food was terrific. One set back was the attitude of the hotel security. Despite the fact that we had spent a small fortune in the restaurant they did not acknowledge the fact we were guests of the restaurant so we could take a nice photo/memento on the verandah.
5
Thank you so much to Paul and Rita for wonderful services with great smiles! With the help of Paul and Rita, our family was able to have great memories and photos to take back home :)
5
Great work Paul!!! U did an excellent job man!!! We will be back...
U got it all personality- service minded and so helpful totally love it
5
Enjoyed the thoughtful and personalized service by Abbas. He bothered to introduce the bar and the location of the city.
5
Atmosphere great with excellent service.
Food was average but can be further improve.
For a monday to go consider quite crowded.
But worth going!
5
We've been celebrating our honeymonn on CÉ LA VI and the staff was very great with us!! We had a wonderful night and appreciate for all kindness!! Thanks so much Paul, Rita and Shin Yen!! We love all!!
4
Highly recommended for stunning city views and good food. It does get very busy, particularly in the bar area with everyone jostling to get a table and getting photos but an enjoyable night. You can also see down into the Gardens of the Bay and enjoy the evening music and light show. We had a lovely dinner sitting outside - a little breezy but preferable to sitting inside as you have no views and, as with most places in Singapore, the air conditioning makes it freezing indoors! Certainly not a cheap place to eat/drink as you are paying for the view but definitely worth a visit.

We dined here and expected great things, unfortunately we were disappointed. Firstly, we asked for a table with a view and had a view of the dj and the sjybar, so not really a view.We chose a combination of the 5 course menu with Wagyu steak as an upgrade and dishes from the a la carte. The Foie Gras starter was well presented and nicely spiced and my wife had the scallops which again were very good. When it came to the Wagyu steak, I asked for it to be cooked “rare” and when it arrived it was over cooked so I asked for it to be done again. Unfortunately, on the next occasion it was again over cooked so I complained to the waiter who apologised and explained the Head chef was not working. This is not a valid reason to mess up a dish twice and I decided to choose something different- the lamb which was good and cooked correctly.Before leaving my waiter informed me he was leaving to go home and another waitress took over, again not very professional. Prior to the bill arriving, I was told it had been checked. When I checked it, it was wrong and still had the Wagyu steak on it, so I complained again. All in all, this was not the experience I would have expected or wanted and I would not return. There are far better options in Singapore and I’m sure places that can cook a steak correctly
2
CeLaVi used to be the most amazing dining experience. If asked about the food by friends you would not just say "yeh it was good" you would say "absolutely fantastic". I have been to the resturant several times and it was one of my most favourite places to take friends when visiting Singapore. There has been a change since the renovation and the food is extremely poor. It is embarrassing now. Still worth going for a cocktail to enjoy the view but do not eat there as it will leave a bad taste in your mouth
5
The place is marvellous. Food was delicious. Specially the Korean chicken starters. Place has nice ambience. The main point is the hospitality of the staff. Everyone took special care. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and the surprise desert was really a nice gesture. Must visit place in Singapore
4
Fantastic views but not for those who dislike heights because you feel right on the edge, like an “infinity pool”. Good service. Service charge automatically added. Cocktails 23SGD plus 10% service charge and tax. Two drinks were £50GBP, so as much as you would pay in England at £25 each. You pay 20SGD each to go up to the bar but are given a fully refundable voucher to spend against drinks. It’s designed to stop time wasters who only want to see the view. Great bar, right up there, so to speak. Worth one drink - at least.
5
Always love visiting CE LA VI. Paul attended to our table & was great. Drinks were good. Lovely view of the city as well! :)
5
It was an amazing place, the view is incredible and the stuff very friendly. Paul had a great attitude and fun personality. It made our vacations even more memorable!!
3
I'm actually a huge fan of the night club, but when it comes to sunday brunch the food is a bit disappointing. Brought a friend here from overseas to impress him. Maybe I'm just picky. As always tho, the view was stunning.
5
Hi everyone
We are crew from the Mein Schiff 1,
Have overnight in Singapore and we meet the most kindest waiter ever. Thanks Paul for the nice night you made for us.
5
Want to get the service of a down to earth man, meet Paul at Ce La Vi restaurant to be amazed with his style. He is modest and his smile will make your day , we had a bad start but he made us went back with so much memories , he and his team mates made us felt so special... Food was awesome as expected.. Enjoyed the Champagne and will definitely come back for them again.Kudos to the whole team
2
Around 2 years back I took two of my friends to this open bar in the rooftop. It was good that time. Recently in August this year(2017) I went with a couple of friends. It was most disappointing. They are now charging an entry fee of $27 or so which comes with just one free drink. It is too expensive. The view is now cramped with many seats of the restaurants occupying major space. It is crowded and you have to jostle to get any kind of clear view. No point in wasting your time. I would recommend Altitude in UOB tower which offers great view and is spacious
4
Ate here mid october and book a table for 6pm so we could see the views in daylight and at night. The view really must be one of the best in the world to sit and enjoy dining at, hence the cost of the food. The service was great and the food was well presented although most of it was pretty spicy and as I don't eat nuts I found the choice quite limiting. I opted for the lamb chops and the waitress suggested I have the sauce on the side in case it was too hot, so that was good advice.If you don't like lots of spice I would suggest the Skybar Casual Dining as they have more western choices, but unfortunately you cannot order from this menu at Ce la vi as they run the restaurants separately. As for price we paid £170 for 2 starters, 2 mains, one desert and 3 alcoholic and 3 soft drinks, which is quite high, but then you are paying for location which we thought was worth it
2
We visited here for the last night of our holiday. The greeting was friendly and informative. We had a drink in the bar, enjoying the great views and then went to our table in the restaurant. We ordered a bottle of wine and some water. The water arrived but it took 30 minutes to get the wine, having asked 3 times. We ordered our food eventually which was more timely. The oyster and scallop ceviche was wonderful as were the tuna rolls. The cod was great too, but all the main courses were barely warm. One of our party had a dessert and then we attempted to pay the bill. It took around 30 minutes to get the bill, even though we were way beyond our 10 o’clock requested leaving time. The Service was chaotic. We had around 5 different servers, with no one apparently coordinating anything. It was impossible to catch anyone’s eye when we required help. At one point one of the managers was walking around asking was everything ok but failed to even look at our table as he passed. Perhaps we were not young or hip enough for this place!!Good views but if you are expecting fine dining with great service I would give it a miss

Booked in advance coming from Overseas, our expectations were significantly dulledIt is accepted that at a premium location an owner can expect to receive near unquestioned custom when quality, service and value are in balanceThe restaurants attraction is the view associated with your meal experience.The menu as presented did show promise but at our table it became apparent that we were expected to eat second hand cigarette smoke if we wanted what we had flown here for - an unparalleled viewEntree included dumplings, salt n pepper squid and wine (where you give up on the wait staff refilling your glass, so you end up doing it yourself)In the meantime, we now had cigarette ash drifting in the breeze toward our tableIn line with our first course of cigarette smoke and dry mouth we then experienced three different crusted lobster dishes of slightly varying temperature which we attributed to altitude and Lamb chops which were cooked to perfection with just enough light to observe that presentation was valuedWe made a commitment to continue to the dessert menu as the nicotine plume had subsided and we observed some of our other diners had made encouraging choices.It appeared that the service improved at this point, we suspect it was to do with the allocated cover time of 2 hours per tableDessert brought an improvement, Hazelnut cake and Whiskey ice cream, Lemongrass sphere, Ice cream n Sorbet and Rose Gateau of mention to a lesser degree Banana Feuille (was small in its offer) Perhaps on a another evening, our experience could have been different as I would hope that if you choose to dine here yours is tooFor the premium you pay for the location, there is plenty to improve

Thank you for accommodating our request for dinner table reservation at Ce La Vie last Friday. Thank you also for the big group reservation few weeks ago. We really appreciate your kind accommodation even at short notice. Our guests from Germany were very impressed by the food, location, service & ambiance. It was perfect and we are so glad to have chosen it as the venue for our celebration. Congratulations on the new menu, every item is exquisite and so beautifully presented. Please extend our thanks to your colleagues for the attentive service and compliments to the chef for the delicious food. Especially king prawn laksa. It was certainly unforgettable. Thanks and wish you more success.

The foie gras was out of this world and so was the view. the service was ok but not outstanding. i would definitely go there again.
5
We went for my wife’s 40th & the food was excellent I had fish & my wife had the steak the view was to die for overlooking the city on 1 side & the harbour on the other.
5
Went on a Friday night for early dinner as I was meeting friends at the lounge later and was pleasantly surprised at the improvements. The food has improved dramatically and the ambience is still amazing. Love the dim lighting and intimate setting. Recommend the wine list, they have lovely reds and the appetisers are delicious. The mushroom dumplings, sushi and salad were all great. To add, the tofu main and cod fish were excellent. The bombay potatoes were also great! The place is expensive, but worth it for the view, ambience and now also the food
5
My partner and I recently stayed at Marina Bay Sands. Staff kindly booked a table on our request and left a confirmation letter in our room.The service was great and the food was spectacular. Cooked perfectly and full of flavour.Great view also! Signature Cocktails were delicious! We hope to be back one day
2
We had expected to be wowed by the view, but also by the restaurant (food, service etc). Unfortunately, we found the latter to be quite disappointing. The food was so-so and the service was overworked. The wait staff seemed very busy and trying their best, but they did not seem to be coping well. We had to chase for our orders multiple times and were ignored/told to wait again and again
5
My friend and I had a great view of singapore from our table and was happily served by the friendliest waiter in singapore! Shout out to Mr Paul at the bar. Will definitely come back for special occasion p.s he have a great smile to
5
Booked table for two on the outside terrace on 31st October. The quality/flavor of the food, the presentation and our server was really really good. One of the best I've had in past few years. While the cost for cocktails, drinks and food is certainly is in the 'Fine Dining' bracket, given the location, views. quality of the food and overall experience, we certainly found it very good value for money.A few tip's... Reservations are only possible on the Straits side of the restaurant outside. Sitting on the city side is 1st come 1st served in the general bar area. The bar area is good but can be bit crowded and loud. The Straits reservations area offers super views over the Gardens by the Bay and out over the sea. It's separate from the bar area and very relaxed. When booking, if asked if your visit is for a special occasion, then say so. We stated we were booking for a birthday. On arrival at Ce La Vie reception on top floor, I got wished a happy birthday & at desert got a few treats with a candle and all :-)Overall, excellent experience
3
I wouldn't say it's a must-do, but if you've got the time and don't mind paying $25 for a cocktail with a view, why not? If you go in the mid-afternoon, it's not crowded.To get there, you go to a desk in the hotel lobby where you have to pay $20 for a $20 food/drink voucher for each person
1
Visited the bar for a couple of cocktails and to enjoy the view as part of honeymoon and were extremely lucky to get two seats at the bar. It was busy and whilst I understand the bar staff are run off their feet, not one person acknowledged our presence. Ten minutes later, after realising the bar tender near to us appeared to only be doing table orders, we finally got someone's attention and were told someone would be with us shortly. We waited another ten minutes or so for someone to take our order, further time (understandably) to make the cocktails, which were delicious, but then were ignored again when trying to pay the bill. The whole experience was unpleasant and whilst the view was stunning was not worth the visit overall and the feeling that we were an inconvenience! 1-altitude at one raffles place had just as beautiful view and the service was much much better. Would advise a visit there over Ce La Ve

Go early at 7:00am and the early bird would quickly be seated and start enjoying the breeze as well as the panoramic view after sunrise. Having ordered scrambled eggs with salmon and a cappuccino, I then get myself plenty of fresh fruits, cheese and a bowl of cereals, sit back and relax! By the time I finish my breakfast as well as reading the newspaper and leave the restaurant, guests have started queueing to get their seats, escorted by helpful and efficient staff who manage to open more sections of the restaurant.It has been a very enjoyable experience, and I end up going there for breakfast for the full duration of my stay in the hotel
5
Brilliant experience while high up. No pun intended. Excellent food and music. Shoot some great pictures also.
4
Fantastic view and buzz around the bar. Drinks a little expensive but you can’t fault the location. Spend a few hours here drink eat and take the best photos. Worth the visit and highly recommended.
5
Despite the price point, considering the ambiance, service and quality of food, I think it is pretty reasonable. The service staffs were really professional and kind, especially Jack Goh. Highly recommend this place for special occasion!
4
The location of this CE LA VI restaurant is unthinkable, at the top of Marina Bay Sands hotel, and when the weather is not cloudy we have an overview of Singapore which is beautiful / stunning.
5
Well you in Singapore... of coz everyone will say it’s expensive to go here... but you are here... soo... come here... this place worth every penny you spend. Ce La Vie Restaurant and Bar is the one of the best way to enjoy Singapore view... staff is friendly and good vibe. We will sure visit again.
5
We planned a 3 night stay in Singapore after our cruise and had heard about this restaurant. I booked our reservation 2 weeks in advance just to be safe. The view is amazing and the food was wonderful! I highly recommend trying an East Side drink (their signature cocktail). Amazing! I would also recommend that you book your reservation so that you can witness the sunset. Bring your camera! The Sky bar is located next to the restaurant, also with amazing views. It tends to be very busy and can be tough to get quick service. So plan ahead if you want a drink before dinner
4
Paying S$20.00 each to get to the Ce La Vie can be used to buy drinks in the roof top bar, so definitely the way to go. Just going to viewing deck is more expensive and no drinks! Good cocktails with stunning views of the city and Indonesia. They have 2 bars one each side of Tower 3 so you can move from one to the other for multiple shots of S'pore. Can get crowded
2
The view from this restaurant is beautiful and the food is quite nice however they are small portions and very expensive. The service was very poor and staff quite rude. People will obviously visit this bar/restaurant for the view but I would suggest just visiting for a drink in the bar. Gave the impression that they don’t have to impress due to captive audience who come for the view
4
Amazing view and very cool vibe. I loved the atmosphere. Was the food great? No. Far from great. It was easy to spend $300 on dinner and I don’t regret it because I enjoyed the experience but if you’re more about food than an overall experience, you’ll get a better meal elsewhere.I had the Botanica 57 cocktail and loved it. Yum - sweet but not too sweet. Had the salt & pepper calamari for starters and it was good because it wasn’t chewy but it was really just deep fried in batter. Not overly tasty. I had the prawn & scallop stew for dinner and didn’t think it was great. A couple of the prawns had me wondering if I’d feel sick later. My husband had the chicken for his main and wasn’t overly impressed. We had the hazelnut/chocolate cake for dessert and it was very average.Like I said, go for the view and the very cool vibe
4
It was worth going to the top of tower three at the Marina Bay Sands to see the view of the harbor and the infinity pool on the 57th floor. Be prepared to pay 20sd for a large beer (20oz) bit steep compared to what I’m used to in US. Really a must do though in Singapor
2
For those in the know, having a drink here gets you around the admission charge for the SkyPark.
Drinks are expensive. After the Louis Vuitton group took over this place, it really hasn't helped.
Go here you that one drink and view at sunset.
4
A lovely venue to meet with friends , enjoy great service and cocktails' while enjoying a sunset vista
4
Nice place to have a dinner with astonishing views and great atmosphere. But too crowded and long waiting time. More about views and fun than about food :)
5
Amazing Food and Great Service . The view is a amazing. A lot better then the Hong KOng Setting. Very much would tell me people to check this place out
4
Nice roof top bar,great views..nice pizza and fries for veg.which we could redeem for entry charges.Service is definitely great.
5
The view from the outdoor area is just breathtaking, book early to get a table ith a view; food is very nice and reasonably priced for the location. The staff was very helpful and arranged fireworks on the chosen dessert for my husband’s birthday without me requesting in advance.Even if you don’t go for dinner it’s still nice for drinks but the bar was a bit crowded, the dinning area was kept very private and they didn’t allow people who didn’t have a table to come in for photos etc.Would definitely recommend it for a lovely night out and even for special occasions
5
The food here is incredible. The lobster was out of this world tasty and the view was stunning. The staff were really friendly and when i called up for a reservation for a good table they delivered we had an amazing table with a fantastic sunset and the cocktails were lush too. An amazing start to our honeymoon and totally recommended
5
We went here for my Husband's birthday.The view is amazing.Loved the music which was lively yet relaxing.Food was amazing,we being vegetarian , had a lot of options to choose from.My favorite for the day was the avocado sushi,morning glory(loved the hint of spice in it) and the Hazel nut cake (divine!)The staff was attentive and very amiable! shall visit agai
5
I wanted to experience the 57th floor of the Marina Sands Hotel complex. After asking how I could, I was directed to Tower 3. For 23 SGD, I was authorized to visit. However, 20 SGD was able to be converted to food or drink at Cé La Vi!I chose two diet Cokes with a slice of dried blood orange. It was a great refreshment, as it was very warm and humid. My bartender was fantastic. The view was ultimately what I came for, and I wasn't disappointed! I would strongly recommended this for people who don't stay at the hotel. It's a reasonable way to see everything from this stunning vantage point
3
Queuing took a while n lobby front desk seems to favor foreigners. Food is exquisite but expensive n came in small portions. Altho i requested for a table with a view, we were seated at a corner of the sheltered area. Overall, quite an underwhelming experience n unlikely to return
5
We went to Ce La Vie for a very special birthday occasion and it was absolutely Amazing, wonderful food, amazing atmosphere and excellent service from the staff. Would highly recommend for a great experience on top of the world !
3
Only go to bar for views. Restaurant food is ok, service is average, not worth the pricing. Hard to see views from restaurant. Just go to bar for the amazing skyline views.
5
I would definitely recommend anyone visiting Singapore to have dinner in this great restaurant. Service and food are top and if you get a good seat on the terrace you will have an unforgettable view. Se pictures.
5
From the elevator ride to the hostess check in, to dinner, the views from the Restaurant, were absolutely Breathtaking!! PJ and Kat(I think that was the waitress, from Korea), were Superb! The service was right on, 5 stars all the way!
4
We called in for a drink, amazing views over looking Singapore and the motel pool. Always busy and quite expensive but there is no where else with such amazing views.
5
We went to this restaurant to celebrate my husband's birthday expecting what the reviews told us - amazing and unparalleled view of Singapore and the experience of being literally on top of the world (56th floor). But we got more than we expected with the efficient and amiable PJ Guillermo, guest service executive, as well as the staff who made sure our dining experience would be a pleasant moment (from giving us the special corner table overlooking the Garden By the Bay domes to touring us to the club lounge). Her suggestion of lobster to go with the grilled Snapper highlighted the sumptuous modern Asian cuisine. We were ready to order dessert when she came in with decadent cakes, one with a sparkler, while singling Happy Birthday! Indeed, our experience will be worth retelling! PJ really gave the extra mile
5
Went to see the sunset and i highly recommend. Cost $20 that you can redeem for food or drinks to go up to level57. Opt for the bar/pool view to watch the sunset. The club view is the restaurant but the view is mostly ships. From the bar view, you can see the famous eternity pool. It was very crowded with swimmers with selfie sticks.The view is undoubtedly amazing especially at night when the building lights are on. Sure worth the visit.
4
Located at 57th Floor of the Marina Bay Sands. The highlight of the place is LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. Amazing views of the city and the ocean. Can see the dozens of ships dotting the horizon. Good service. Nice menu. Has something for everybody. Expectedly on the pricier side. I do find it idiotic though to have the bar overlook the inside rather than the ocean.On a warm day the heat can be a dampener though. The best views are outside/in the bar side area
5
The food is excellent here, the view is the best in Singapore and it’s ‘the place to go’ here in Singapore for food and drinks if you want to have a nice evening in a bustling atmosphere. It is pricey, but what can you expect of a rooftop at the premier location of the country. It’s worth every penny
5
Loved the amazing views from Cest La Vie. We had a side table overlooking the domes from the Garden of the Bay. The bar is really cool too. The food was excellent and so was the service. It's pricey but the view makes up for that. It disappointing that we couldn't go out in the sky deck from the restaurant but it doesn't distract from the quality of the bar and restaurant
5
We were recommended to go to ce la vi instead of observation deck and omgosh was it so much better.. the view and the food was simply beautiful..xx
3
Overall is good, but not much as expected. Service is normal nothing impressive. Over all is find except only about prices. Mostly expensive.
5
Nice view, Nice services especially there is one attendant, Paul, Friendly and lovely
This is a place a to be if you are in Singapore... and make sure Paul is your attendant...
5
It is a paradise you would never imagine. No words can described the high quality of services they provide to the customer/tourist. This is the place you should never missed when you're in Singapore. Thank you CE LA VI!
2
Ive since heard you can take up a free elevator ride up to Ce La Vi but we had to pay $25 each, our then 12 year old kids were free. We went for a look, a snack and some cocktails. You can use the $25 toward food and drinks. Food is expensive and really nothing to rave about. The drinks were great.There weren't many people there and we had good service. The views over Singapore and the Marina bay sands area are fantastic and you can see the horizon pool with all the fashionable hotel guests who are probably sick of tourists/customers staring at them
5
I visited with my Family in early October. Great cocktails (even off the menu), generous bite size plates to start, followed by amazing decent sized mains & decadent dessert (chocolate is recommended). Service was spectacular, more than pleased with Yul, our wonderful waiter, extremely accommodating and friendly. Couldnâ€™t recommend him & bar staff highly enough. Worth spending the extra money for quality and comfort. The view is amazing also. Definitely worth a visit whilst at Marina Bay Sands. The view from the Club Lounge prior was superb - many thanks to all
5
This is our favourite place in Singapore... the quality of the food, the cocktails and the service is always great. We also feel very special when we come here thanks to the restaurant's manager, Leo Lopez. He is an amazing host and always goes the extra mile to attend us with special treats.I definitely recommend CE LA VI, it has not only the best view from Singapore but it is also a great night out experience
3
I was expecting a great restaurant on the top floor of the Marina Sands Hotel but to my dismay I ended up in a place that smelled like a dirty restaurant kitchen, that had a depressing old interior, and is set back on the roof of the hotel so that you cannot even enjoy the views. The place is overpriced with such small portions too. The only redeeming factor is they have a gluten free menu.
4
I would love to come back here next time. Great ambience, tasty food overlooking the city, and friendly staff. The manager even let us see the pool area, relaxed there for a while and went back to the resto to gaze at the magnificent lights once again.Actually dreaming of this place right now
5
Stopped by Singapore from our US trip. We decided to dine in Ce La Vi restaurant. We were greeted with warmth , friendly manner. We requested to be seated outdoors ( amazing view by the way ) we were treated like royalty a service that is impeccable , truly what the management doing reflects to the team. Suzette the Restaurant Manager carries a superb service not just to us but the rest of the tables. Yul our server, he is outstanding. Could not thank all the one who touches our table. A memorable experience. Will be back for our next trip.
5
All dishes were extremely good. The request for a vegan meal was taken care of very well. Further, a nice ambiance with a fantastic view. Not to forget our sweet waitress Rita who took care of us most perfectly.
5
Very impressed with the food. We had a table outside and the view was spectacular. Our waitress Shin Yien was very bubbly and attentive. Would definitely recommend.
3
Such an amazing location, unfortunately the quality of the food and service lets its down. It's priced based on its location, so you would expect the quality to match but not so.
5
My family and I enjoyed my dad's 75th Birthday dinner at Ce La Vi. The views from the rooftop are amazing. The staff were very accommodating in moving us from a table too large for a party of 5 to a smaller table with a better view! The food was amazing! Shin Yien was our server and she took very good care of my family. Great service and food. Shin Yien even brought out some desserts, on the house, when she realized we were celebrating a birthday. That was very sweet of her. The host that evening was very accommodating to our needs and we really appreciated it!
3
You go there for the food, for the view and maybe to have a conversation over dinner. it is noisy and talking might be a challenge , the food is ok and nicely presented but small selection only, view is limited as you sit inside and can not get to the rail as you are not a Hotel guest. Would recommend other places to dine and impress in Singapore
3
This place is good but overpriced and overrated. Cocktails were good but again the experience wasnâ€™t great due to overcrowding. View is definitely great but service could have been better.A well planned dinner would work but not in hurry. Wish if we could get there during sunset or evening. Will try next time again.
5
Having just experienced an amazing meal in an amazing location I cannot imagine why anyone would give this restaurant less than 5 stars.Sitting on level 57 (the roof) of the Marina bay Sands you have amazing views over Singapore and as we were there at 8pm we had a great view down onto the Gardens by the Bay evening light show.Our particular hostess (Rita) was very knowledgeable of the menu and happy to recommend suitable sides for particualr courses. Could not fault it.Admittedly not the cheapest in Singapore but for a special or romantic occasion this is excellent.I note a few 1 star reviews and all I can say is that if you want a 'happy meal' then go to MacDonalds
4
We went here for dinner and the food is take on modern Asian cuisine. The food was good, but nothing really special. The service was generally very good and the views are stunning.However overall the food and drinks are completely overpriced based on what you get and I would probably not make it a venue I would visit every time now when I am back in Singapore
5
This place has a such a beautiful view at night where you get to see the night lights of Singapore. The service was good the ladies at the front, the food was delicious and for me just the right amount. I had the foie-gras and the short rib
4
Wonderful service and fine plates on top of Marina Bay Sands.Do not forget to make a reservation on this unique restaurant. I would recommend outside, as it is very romantic, when it gets dark. You have little candles on each table, perhaps not enough to see the wonderful meal
1
Went for birthday of my friend... Menu has changed, to be honest became worse than it was before. Service is average, not what you expect from place like this. View is good, so better come here for drink, rather than for food.
1
This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. Change of chef and drop of quality of the service. The location remains wonderful (view) so I recommend to come for a drink skipping the over expensive dinner
5
Had a great dinner there with spectacular views of Singapore by night... palatable delicacy accompanied with charming ambience... though there were flashes of lightning & drizzle for a short while, it was a great Chillax time with my love 💞
5
Spectacular view with awesome service by the staffs ( really accommodating to request in particular)With wide range of cocktails available as well.Definitely a to-go place for me and still a favourite today.
1
Have visited this place many times before. We’ve made a reservation for my husband birthday party. 4 people table. I was surprised to find a new updated menu from new chief cook. All top dishes are avoided from the list. Black cod now is served with a meat around which is terrible if you are the vegan! Ordered 4 different type of desserts. Very average (( Service is slow....Place became totally touristic without soul.
2
The view is fantastic and there was a light show on which made it even more spectacular however the whole experience was ruined by rude staff and rubbish service. You pay 20$ as a ‘drinks voucher’ to enter the sky bar, however all alcoholic drinks are over this price. When we approached the bar, a lady behind the bar cleaned the same surface and ignored us for a good five minutes. We finally got her attention and asked for a drinks menu which she looked appalled at us for speaking to her and gave us one in a rude and dismissive manner. My boyfriend and I decided we would not order with her due to her attitude. Soon after a very stressed looking man I can only assume was the bar manager came over and asked us if we’d like a seat so we said yes, he looked around and then directed us to a small bar stool table which already had a man sitting on it. The customer looked confused and it was awkward the way the manager had approached it so we declined and said we would sit at the bar instead. My partner then took the opportunity to explain we wouldn’t be ordering from the lady behind the bar due to her poor attitude and instead of apologising, the man dismissed our complaint saying ‘she doesn’t understand, she just does the dishwasher’- this is a poor excuse for such an expensive bar. It was not a communication issue, the woman was rude and dismissive. We chose to order from the other bar inside and again were met by a rude bartender. Won’t be returning- it’s a shame because he venue is lovely, music is good but the staff let it down.
5
Visited Ce La Vi whilst on holiday from the Uk to celebrate our 40th anniversary. Had a great time, brilliant food and superb views over the harbour and Gardens by the Bay. Would definitely recommend going there just before sunset, so that you see the remarkable sights in daylight as well as during the illuminations. A special thank you must go to our waitress, Rita, who was extremely friendly and very helpful, ensuring that our evening was very enjoyable and memorable.Would also recommend going to the harbour front, laser and lights show at 9.00pm, which is only a short walk from Ce La Vi and a great way to finish your evening
5
Our waiter, Paul, went above and beyond with his incredible service. My dad and I were only in Singapore 1 night before we head to Everest the next day and I wasn’t able to get in to see the infinity pool because I was wearing thongs. Paul noticed how disappointed we were not be able to see this wonderful view and he walked me through, spoke to every manager and security guard he could to be able to let me in and enjoy the view over the infinity pool. I am so incredibly grateful to Paul and the amazing team at Ce La Vi, Marina Bay Sands, for making my experience so wonderful. Thank you!!!
5
I was at the restaurant with 2 business partners to have a good time with a view and food. Our waiter Rita made our night enjoyable with friendly and smiling personality. This was my 3rd time at this restaurant and can warmly recommend it to others
5
Restaurant at 57 Floor is really amazing, having food drinks at top of Singapore is such a amazing Feeling you get.Have drinks enjoy the food watch beautiful night view of Singapore .You can sit, stand whatever you like but must place to go if you are visiting Singapore.CE LA VI has a lounge as well which is awesome just dance enjoy the music and have a relax calm beautiful dinne
5
Anyone who visits singapore and would like to go clubbing this is a club you cannot miss. Its really a breath taking experience to be on that rooftop and sipping on your favorite drink.
I recommend this to everyone
5
Enjoyed a beautiful Meal here for a birthday celebration. Our beautiful attendant Rita thoroughly looked after us and made our visit even more enjoyable. Beautiful food, amazing views and atmosphere. Highly recommend for a special occasion.
5
Was visiting CE LA VI for lunch recently with my colleague. Great service and food. Very friendly staff. Amazing view !
Special thanks to Suzette :)
Recommend to everyone!
4
Good drinks, friendly & fast service, a good place to see the lights show on the bay at 8 pm. Super noisy music - maybe on purpose to keep the rotation high?
5
Had fantastic meal on 4th October for my partners birthday. Food was amazing and service great. Views are phenomenal of the city! Very expensive but you get what you pay for and worth it.
5
Visit to this restaurant was a nice experience. You must visit it after sunset so that you get a bird's eye view of glittering Singapore all around.this restaurant being situated at 56 floor gives you feeling of being at top in Singapore. The ambiance is just superb with a good view of infinity pool from disco theque . A must visit place in evenin
1
Went for Wedding Anniversary lunch with my husband and child because age policy states restricted timing of children for dinner. No matter how appetising the food could be, the service and attitude of the staffs totally spoilt everything! 1. Staffs were impolite and unfriendly. Especially the Caucasian/French lady whose attitude seemed to nicer to those non Chinese tourists. 2. Even booking was made, indicating it was Wedding Anniversary celebration, there wasn't anything complimentary/special prepared. No wishes greetings in any form. 3. When we chose not to order any alcohol(wine) because we don't consume alcohol, we were shown the displeased look. Good services only provided for big spenders that splurged on opening bottles of wine??? Also no one really bothers to check if everything was fine and no one bothers to refill the water.4. Child got bored of the sit down meal. Was abit loud (in fact the restaurant was too quiet!) and walked around. Was warned to keep volume down and must keep an eye on my child. How can anyone demands a preschool child to be totally quiet and soft, and to be seat bounded at all times? My child wasn't even running around.Felt offended AND insulted! Spoilt our mood and appetite, and celebration totally!All in all, the restaurant DOESN'T seem to respect the locals or the Chinese. Racist or biased? If CE LA VI doesn't tolerate the presence of children in the restaurant, you should have stated ONLY ADULT policy! Definitely not value worth for the kind of services provided! Greatly disappointed and disgusted! Your restaurant certainly stood out with the bad service standards
5
Elegant restaurant with flawless and attentive service. Special thanks to “LEO” manager on duty on that time who always come to our table to check if everything was okay. He really gave us the best experience ever for me and for my future Girlfriend. Good job Leo! And to rest of the team. Highly recommend!!!
4
We struggled to find a fine dining restaurant in Singapore that allows kids below 7 (or even 10). I had to go for “almost fine dining” and had chose Ce La Vi over Gunther’s for the view over the food.But I was pleasantly surprised that the food was quite good and the views was breathtaking. I would have even settled for so-so food for that view. But overall, we were very happy that we chose Ce La Vi to celebrate my wife’s birthday dinner with our 2 young kids.A special mention for the tomahawk steak, which was too much even for the 4 of us, and was really good
5
This beautiful restaurant has so many things going for it. One of the bar staff kindly found a table for us for drinks before we sat down for dinner, and we were then very well looked after throughout our meal. What also stood out was being asked about any dietary requirements when we booked, and then being presented with tailored menus accordingly. This was a real highlight as it completely removes the awkward element of having to ask what is in a particular dish, and means you can completely relax. Restaurant manager Leonardo was very charming, as was the Executive Chef Joseph, both of whom took the time to say hello to us. Exceptional service, particularly on a very busy Saturday night. And to top it all off you can enjoy the best view in Singapore
4
The view is good. Ambience. Food. Are all nice. Except that due to space constraint, it’s a little bit packed. With lots of people and the employees walking around, it’s quite messy. However it’s a good experience. Will come again
5
It is such a pleasure to have the opportunity to taste delicately prepared food with such amazing views. We loved the menu and can't wait to be back
5
What a great restaurant! We had an amazing table overlooking the view out to the marina. The food was out of this world. We had the ribeye steak and the chicken followed by matcha cheesecake and chocolate cake. It was beautifully presented and tasted brilliant. I must mention our waitress, Chloe, she couldn't have done more for us. She was so professional but also really personable. We were there as part of our honeymoon trip and the restaurant experience we had couldn't be faulted. Thank you for such a special evening
3
We wanted to see the view from the top, you pay $s20 each to go up there which you get backs against food and drink, one singapore sling is $ 23 so soon eat that up.Chose informal dining as wanted to sit outside. The food was OK when it finally arrived but waited a long time and 2 dishes arrived 15 mins apart so not great!It was fine for a snack, drink and the view. Can also see the hotel infinity pool although can only get in there if you are. A hotel guest or pay for a day ticket
2
We went to the bar instead and it was crowded and no table available and no service from the crew. Hardly to get attention from the service staff to take order. Cocktails price btw 20-25 SGD. Overall, the view is fascinating but not the bar and the service.
5
If you’re touring Singapore, you know it’s expensive, but don’t automatically think this place isn’t worth the price.It’s $20SGD per person to go up to the 57th floor. While this is only for the restaurant and bar, and NOT the look out deck, it’s worth it if you want to sit in the heat with a once in a lifetime view and a cold beverage. The key point to this is that while it’s $40SGD for a couple, the $40 is also a credit towards your bill. If you order 2 drinks then it’s pretty much a free trip up and anywhere else I’ve travelled in the world (Toronto CN Tower etc) you pay $25-30 a person to go up and then additionally you have to pay to get a drink etc. In my opinion this experience was worth $40. The view is amazing day or night, don’t question it unless it’s rainy
3
After a very tiring day of walking around, I decided to get some of the great views of Singapore from the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck, but somehow I ended up in this restaurant and had to pay if I wanted to go to the observation deck, I guess it was my fault. Me and my girlfriend got a SGD 20 voucher we could use at this restaurant, which is the price you pay to get up there. Everything is crazy expensive by the way, I ordered a SGD 24 pizza that took more than 20 minutes to arrive, the pizza itself tasted good but it is not worth the price. We also got one mojito which costed about the same as the pizza, it was good but was full of ice. The place is very crowded, we only stayed at the bar as there was no place to sit. The service at the bar was good. The only special thing about this place is it's location and the good views
5
Awesome view makes for the perfect setting for a romantic dinner out. The menus were awesome and the service was impeccable. The food was an experience in itself. It was great to be served meals that were not only crafted to perfection but also were a taste sensation. Is a bit overpriced tho
1
I went for dinner with my Friend with all the good comment given to me by friends..but it turn out to be a very disappointing dinner. The calamari was so salty, Korean chicken wing tasteless....as for the main course we order a beef short rib and cod fish. Then we order the dessert, I think this was the worst, they even serve the dessert with melted ice cream..see photo.Overall disappointed dinner
3
So there were 14 of us meeting up for a birthday dinner /drinks There is no doubt the view from the TOP is great but the fact is that the restaurant is in and surrounded by the Sky Park so it is absolutely crammed with tourists hardly a stress free environment to dine in to me The food is not bad though struggling to have an identity I Guess it is Asian Fusion Pretty expensive as well
4
The menu offers a kind of fusion Thai cuisine. Hamachi carpaccio and black cod are excellent! The atmosphere is great too. It's a bit overpriced but to be expected with the location. Very nice service though. I didn't regret it!
5
The views were spectacular and no photos could do it justice. The food was faultless with an extensive range of matching wines. The service was the only area improvements could be made (clearly plates etc)
5
Had my wife’s 65th birthday dinner here. Excellent service and attention to detail. My wife had a latex allergy and the executive chef came out to discuss the food options with her. Superb
3
We were there to celebrate my wife’s birthday, and were given an excellent table with fantastic views.The food was really nice, tasty and quite generous portions. One thing that puzzled me was that no serving utensils were brought with the dishes... when I asked the server she looked quite appalled that I had asked and said some customers do not like them... (really???)The price was on the high side with a bottle of wine costing over S$140 ... so the spend per person for us was S$250... therefore, I would suggest this is a place for special occasions only... but don’t expect silver service wait people.
1
We went for dinner last Friday. We had booked two weeks previously and requested an outdoor table. We booked for 8 o'clock. When we arrived we were told the table was not ready, would we like to have a drink. Eventually at 8.30 we were taken to a table right at the center of the indoors section - no outside view at all. We asked to be moved, and were told that a outside table might be available in 30-45 minutes. At this point it felt like we were seen as difficult customers and we got very poor attention. Everything was very slow and inattentive. After starters we did get moved to an outdoor table, the mains were served. The ribeye was luke-warm and flavorless - very disappointing. Again it took ages to get desert menus and coffees - all seeming like just too much trouble. It even took 15 minutes to get the bill! When I asked to see someone to provide feedback it took another 10 minutes and we were offered a free round of drinks, which we didn't want and eventually we had our first round of drinks knocked off the bill. At one point we were told "it's been bad for everyone tonight because of the rain". How does that make it ok? This is a very expensive restaurant that should be providing the level of experience it promises - it certainly didn't for us
5
Excellent food although a bit pricey. I guess you get to pay a premium for location and experience. The service and staff was excellent, I called them twice to move my reservation because I was running late and they were very accommodating. Needless to say the view is the highlight

Everything was great! The food was delicious. I had lamb and it was the best I've ever tasted! Also, the staff where just lovely, they congratulated us on our anniversery and gave us an extra desert.And the view was of course amazing! Even though it was quite expensive, it was worth it!
5
The staff was very friendly and professional. The food was AMAZING. I took seabass as main and cheesecake as desert. It was really, really good.The view of the restaurant was the main reason we visited the place and it was very beautiful and romantic. We were here in the evening.It was very pricey but definetely worth it

Celavi is the best restaurant in Singapore food was great and ambiance was breathtaking. price is reasonable as location was on the top of Marina Bay Sands. behind my table a couple announced that they are getting married and the crowd was applauded for the proposal and as a woman i got so jealous, i was wearing a dress and felt cold. Thanks to the staff Nhara who offered me a shawl to comfort me. He offered a good service, asking if i need coffee and indeed i needed a capucino... my fiance kept going no where and i didn’t know whats going on, and Nhara was there on my table to keep looking if i needed something. the best service in Singapore as i can say so far from the moment we arrived. money wise is worth it as we felt that we were on the clouds .Great food and service excellent!

We were there for the dinner and got very lucky with the table - first from the Super Trees side, on a more private part of the deck with just a few tables around us. Beautiful view! The choice on the menu is not impressive. Even for Singapore, it's overpriced.Overall, if you want to enjoy the view - I would recommend to come for drinks and look around, but whether you will enjoy dining - depends on your taste. The food was ok. Service - good for local standards. Quick, not personal
3
great views but was expeciting more glamour in a city liike singapore. very touristic. food was good but service was poor
5
Loved this restaurant. The food was A+. The service was great compared to any other bar or restaurant we have visited in Singapore and the views were to die for. A must place to dine for dinner while in Singapore
5
Wow, what a experience.
57 floors up with beautiful views of Singapore city.
Fantastic service from the waitress (Meshna) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The food was amazing and recommend the soup, grilled rangers valley beef tomahawk to serve 2-3 people. 😋

You might as well have a drink. You can pay just to go up the elevator for the roof top view, or you can pay to have a drink up at Ce La Vi and also get to enjoy the view. Beware the potato chips/crisps-they are wasabi flavored
5
We are satisfied to this amazing restaurant as the food was great and service.I was invited for a dinner a group of 7 it is almost clossing as we are late, but tanks to NARA who recommend best food we ended ordering all appetizers as we are already full. He recommend nice champagne VEUVE It was awesome... and we ended with amazing desserts ( ice cream 6 flavor, Tropical Fruits, and Passion fruit cake ) service was excellent tanks to Nara as he assist us on taking our needs.We will comeback as we had great experience

We read up on the Ce La Vi and checked its website and booked on line a month ahead. Our expectations were high it was a Fine Dining Restaurant that had a dress code so we decided to celebrate my 70th Birthday at this what appeared a magnificent Restaurant. Sadly we were disappointed as it was not as promoted as I wore a suit (no tie) and we were dismayed at the people in the restaurant in thongs and shorts. The restaurant was busy but this should not generate bad service which we received we were treated like a number the dishes were practically thrown on the table and my Foie Gras was raw, my Lamb Chops were too rare. We filled out the section on the booking for special requests and mentioned the Birthday Celebration - nothing! So after we realised we could not see anything from our table - no point in dining on the 57th floor paying Top $ if you cannot enjoy the view! - we finished our main course paid the bill of $283.00 for 2 entrees, 2 mains and 2 only glasses of wine and returned to the Hotel Club Room for a night cap. Plenty of other great restaurants in Marina Bay Sands. Win Some Lose Some

Visited Ce La Vi with a friend for drinks, and we weren't disappointed. The atmosphere was vibrant and the staff attentive. And the view was stunning. We were the to watch the sunset and it was totally beautiful. Just be warned that there's a $22 charge to get to the bar, but they do give you a voucher for one drink. And as with most places in Singapore the prices for drinks is up there, but for the view and atmosphere, totally worth it.
4
The views are magnificent. We went for a Team Award so were able to splurge somewhat. The food is good, and not as expensive as I was expecting. I was hoping for something a little more - Singapore being such a food destination and MBS such an Iconic building. But the food was good, just not excellent. The wine list is as extensive as it is expensive. If you really want, there are some bottles over $10,000 Sing. The wines we had were nowhere near that but were still quite nice but pricey compared to normal retail prices (even for Singapore).If you're in a larger group (we had 6) you'll probably sit at a larger round table. Try and avoid this as it is quite difficult to have a conversation with anyone not next to you. The music at those tables can be quite loud. There are some other tables you can get that are more intimate. But booking early would help here - we were very last minute. Service as you would expect. Friendly, attentive, responsive. Overall definitely worth a 1-off experience.Lastly, if you are going before sunset, take a hat and sun glasses. The sun can be quite intense until sunset
5
Quite simply a world class dining experience covering every element of a wonderful meal. Nothing was missed.The views are just the beginning, with Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia all on show, particularly if you dine around 6pm and see the transition from day to night. A perfect location.The ambience of the restaurant is lovely. Lots of people having a great time, great music and a very relaxed vibe. The restaurant team magnify this - clearly they are a hand picked, elite group that worked in unison. Nothing was too much bother and they were clearly having fun!Rita was our waitress. She was magnificent. Such knowledge of the menu and assisted us in the selection for our 5 year old son, making sure we selected something he would love. She made the night. Thanks so much!And the food? Well it was amazing! Asian flavours that were so wonderful we can not wait for our next opportunity to dine at Ce la vi.

It's definitely worth a look to go to the top of the Marina Sands hotel. You can access the restaurant from tower three of the hotel by paying $20 which you can apply towards a drink although most drinks cost you about $22-$23. I must say the view is gorgeous and would definitely do this if you would like to grab a drink and get a view of Singapore. You do not have access to the observation deck but you pretty much have a view of everything that they would see. And you also have access to the area next to the infamous infinity edge pool of the Marina Sands hotel. There's a great place to take a few pictures for Instagram Facebook etc
5
Casual bar/lounge with city views. Visit as part of tourist activity to Marina Bay Sands skybar rather than the skydeck. Good wait staff. Menu with pizzas, satays etc. Pricey.
3
The view is awesome but you can easily settle for drinks. And drinks are really good.
Quality of food and price really don’t match. Price is high, food just average. Staff needs to pay a bit more attention.
5
money worth to try.. the food is great and the atmosphere and music is great for couples.. looking forward to be there again next time
4
The food is a little overpriced to say the least but you are really paying for a view that is jaw dropping. We got a great table for a special meal while on honeymoon and were really well looked after by the staff. The sushi I had for starter was delicous. We ordered two mains but really didn't need sides to go with them - it was a little bit of a ploy from the staff to get us to spend a little extra! There was a wait on food but the manager did come out to apologise which was much appreciated. Considering that you have to pay to get to the top as a non guest anyway having a drink is probably a more cost effective way of taking in these stunning views
3
Dinner for two on a Saturday night was fun as the view is great and it was the Grand Prix weekend. It is all a bit of a palava though, meaning getting in, having a pre dinner drink at the bar (there's no option) and finally getting your pre booked table.Service was pretty bad at the table and the food was fine but not particularly memorable
4
You would pay to sit and drink at this restaurant so food is just a bonus.260 degree views from an open restaurant with a sunken outdoor bar. Our most recent meal was nice but not as good as the first time. High price for a nice meal. Having said that, we enjoyed our dinner with the ambience and the unbeatable views
5
Ce LA Vi Restaurant & Rooftop Bar in Singapore was an amazing an beautiful experience. I highly recommend it when you're in Singapore!!! The views of downtown Singapore accross the water are incredible!!! The food & drunks are fabulous, you can't go wrong adding this stop to your list of things to do!!!! Enjoy!!!!
2
Booked a table for 4. (3 guests first time) Got seated inside next to the bar at a table for 6 so large that we hardly could discuss any business. After 1.30 hour we where offered a table outside for dessert. Ordered an expensive red French wine which came out of the refrigerator and served in White wine glasses. Some food was nice and some missing a more profound taste. Service ok but not very attentive. Total bill about 520US$. Would I return ? Maybe with first time visitors but rather dine outside and come up for a drink late evening.
5
A spectacular venue equalled by the dinner The staff were 1 st class and delivered both drinks and food with great serviceThe food was as good as i have had. Good portion sizes and brilliant qualityYou need to book ahead as it is so popularPricing was ok, though some of the wine prices were up thereWe were in and out in 2 hours. Weren't rushed at allReally, a must do if you have the tim
4
We were seated in the outdoor section and the views were incredible (although not sure what would happen if it rained as the restaurant was full). The food was great as were the cocktails. Mot a quiet venue, but the vibrant feel and music suits the location
5
Had a great night. Fab food and great service. The staff couldn’t have been more attentive, or friendly. The waitress, Shin Yiew, looked after us and made sure our visit was special.
4
Went for a family meal. The food was of a very good standard and expected the quite high cost due to the fact you get stunning views of the city. Glad we went.
4
The food was great, service was amazing & drinks (especially the cocktails) yummy!
Definitely come back, when we are back!
5
The restaurant was amazing. Beautiful views across the harbour, the staff were very attentive and the food did not disappoint. We shared all of our dishes as we didn't want to miss out. The tuna jicama rolls and salmon sushi were so fresh, we also had the grilled snapper, the steamed sea bass and the short ribs. To finish we had the passionfruit mousse. All beautifully presented and so delicious, we certainly left very full. The staff were also very good about catering to my friends dietary requirements
5
We went here to celebrate my Mums birthday whilst staying at MBS. The food was outstanding and the drinks were reasonably priced (considering it's at the top of a 5* hotel with amazing views). My mum has a latex allergy meaning she can't have any food prepared with gloves so, the executive chef came to our table to discuss what my mum would like and he would prepare it personally.Everything about this place was high quality, I would definitely go back to experience the rest of the menu; I had the Lamb this time around and would highly recommend it
2
Fiance and I decided to try out Ce La Vie for our date night - didn't enjoy it at all.We had requested a seat with a view, which we got. But the lighting was so poor that we had to strain to read anything even with those clip on lights. And the music from the bar was so loud we just couldn't hear each other at all.I found the pricing to be exorbitant - I guess you're paying for the brand and views.If much rather go visit the sky park if I wanted the views.
1
Service here was terrible ... booked in for dinner ... waited 30 mins for our first cocktail ... waiters kept forgetting we were there and to serve us and at that time there were only 8 diners ... we had to ask 3 times to order a bottle of wine ... food was good though and that's what the 1 star was for ... if you go up here just go for a drink much better restaurants around .. Altitude is better for views as you are not catering for hotel guest
3
For this my second I had high expectations. Firstly I could at last share the experience with my girlfriend and there was F1 in town. The view did not let us down. The menu we chose was a set 4 course F1 menu. I knew it was an expensive restaurant however there was a stone in the shoe. The food was simply not on par with the price. The first dishes I have mostly forgotten about as they did not make any long lasting memory. The beef was difficult to chew. We did mention this to the waiter, however she did not seem to care. I have honestly had much better for a lot less in Singapore.The dessert was actually good. I did have a good time, however that was mainly due to the company of my girlfriend
4
Obviously this is a must do by night in Singapore. Enjoy a drink with others at a set of couches that overlook the city skyline of Singapore. You pay for the view but it's great also if you have time to kill on transit through Singapore
5
Wonderfull views on the skyline of Singapore. Good food (not exceptional) and service. Bit of pressure on the time one can spend because of next seating. Don't expect to have good views on the sound and light show in front of the hotel as they don't allow you to do s
5
A fine dining restaurant.Excellent food and decor.A bit pricey but an overall good experience.Our waitress Jain was very helpful and professional.The light show which was recommended was a little disappointing.but the views ( 57th floor) were fantastic.
4
great service, nice view even though its hot,the rujak dish is spot on and generous portion. frederick the friendly bartender.
5
Me and my girlfriend we had an amazing night at Ce La Vi Restaurant thanks to the great view, music and to the best waiter Paul. We're definetely coming back.
4
Reserved to celebrate my bday, bcoz of last minute reservation we only get the slot for lunch time. The food was good and the view was great ( i think at nite would be more romantic with the light and city view)
5
It was really amazing to stand on top of such a cool building in Singapore. It was totale worth the expensive drinks!
4
Very impressed with the CE LA VI restaurant in Singapore. Very good food and exceptional service from Rita. Thank you for making it special :-)
5
CE LA VI was our first experience with Singapore and I have to say it was worth it all! Our night here was marvellous, we had a really great time and I have to admit it, it was part of Paul's fault (he's quite a photographer too). He made us feel very comfy and welcomed. We've met some really nice people, enjoyed the wine and listened to awesome music. Best experience and the best view you can get.PS: not to forget about the delicious treat I got for being the bday girl! ❤
2
No dress code. Some ladies would dress up to visit a beautiful place but men are wearing round neck tees with flip-flops and thorn shorts. After renovation they closed VIP area again, the place became so narrow to dance or move about. Visited the place just for the view - i hosted a visitor from overseas. But we were so bored and moved to BangBang instead.I gave up on this placeFor the view better visit 1Altitude
4
We followed the advice of a local friend, and chose Ce La Vi as our means to get to the top of the Marina Bay Sands for the view. Instead of paying to get to the Skypark, you can buy a $S20 voucher and turn it in for food/drink/merchandise at the top. Since most drinks in Singapore at upscale places tend towards $S20, you blow the voucher on one, but you get the amazing view as a bonus. We went during the changeover from the afternoon to dinner service, so had to move during our visit, but other than that it was pretty much worth the cost to get a view plus the glasses of sparkling wine with which we toasted it
3
Had booked in through the internet two months before hand. We visited on a Saturday night so it was crowded. But the table we were placed at was right beside the bar where there was no view. Let's face it, why would you go to a restaurant at the top of a hotel if it isn't for the view. So much for reserving a table early.Food and service were good
4
Ce La Vi is a must visit for all tourists in Singapore. It is the rooftop bar at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and provides the best views of the city. Be sure to dress smart and get ready to spend some serious money.
5
Fantastic location, pretty good food but possibly a little pricy for some. Although with the views you have and the amazing location you can't really expect it to be any different! Definitely recommend, great experience.
3
Visited for the view as it was just average otherwise. Appeared mainly patronised by wannabees. Drinks ultra expensive, even lemonade. Staff a little pompous.
4
Very few options if you are vegan or vegetarian. With so many vegetarian travelling they need to incorporate in the veg diet. The service is great.
4
Been there once to the sky bar. The view from the city is blocked by many glass walls. Busy place and the tables are always reserved. Weekends are extremely busy.
2
On top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel this is a great great location. We went twice. The first time we thought good value to go to floor 57 and see Singapore spread out in front of us. We turned left out of the lift and whatever the bar is called has great views. The second time in daylight the bar to the left was closed off. Only Ce La Vie was allowed. Poor views actually from here so we didn't feel so fantastic. Singapore dollars 20 each and a drink for that. I would recommend.
5
Great view, good food, and nice wine list. Priced at what you would expect, not more. We had an inside table but the lady took us outside when one opened up without us asking. Found a good bottle Ch Bernodette 2011 for 123 so was more than acceptable - the other wines were a bit too young 2015 mostly. Overall loved the DJ and the ambiance. The view may not be as good as equinox at swissotel but the food, drinks, service and price were all better. With the Dj thrown in I prefer this for a night out.
5
We had a dinner reservation at Ce La Vi , it was a treat for my friend's birthday , the food was worth the price , but the service was not as expected, after dinner we went to the sky bar for a drink , we was greeted by Paul and tads went the birthday ambiance came lively. He greeted my friend with his beautiful smile and made us feel special all night long , telling happy birthday when ever he came over to our table .. help us took pictures as thou he was a professional photographer , but his skill were great .. worth the night.. if step by sky bar make sure find for Paul. This guy wil give u the best possible service
4
The food was excellent. My wagyu starter was good (too much spicy for the quality of the meat). My lamb was just flawless. Wine was expensive (as usual in Singapore). Service was great and the view from Marina Bay Sands is astonishing. Aperitive was great with the bar just next to it. I was disappointed with the impossibility to take a picture of the view.
4
Don't go to the observation deck. You pay $26 for a confined space with nothing to do, and a view only on one end. Pay the cover fee to get up to Ce La Vie, buy one (albeit overpriced) drink, and enjoy the views from three different vantage points. In the afternoons they serve popcorn and other snacks for free, and the DJ is awesome. Really. It's worth it. And I can't speak highly enough of Jaine, a server at the bar. She was so incredibly kind, fun, fast, and helpful!!!!!
4
Highly recommend this place during sunset and night time. The city views are incredible. Cocktails are tasty and the $20 entry fee includes drinks too. We had a wonderful waiter named Paul who was kind and hilarious.
4
Excellent facilities, GREAT views, but the food was on the small side of things for the price......The wine list is really good ...but phew ...the prices!!!
4
They remembered and rendered my humble request for celebrating a birthday under a wonderful window seat. Thank you so much!
3
Chose this restaurant for a special birthday celebration. Booked ahead of time so we could have a window seat even the manager of Club 55 rang to confirm.Arrived on time , no good evening or how are you just have you a reservation. Table wasnt ready and told to stand near the bar until it was. After awhile , no one came to us, we went back to front desk and then shown our table which was not a window seat!Busy and music abit loud and members of the public would walk through cordoned off areas to see the view. Staff tried to move them on.Very disappointing. Food nice but have had better. Expected bette
5
I booked Ce la vi already knowing it was on the upper scale price range of Singapore so I had no surprises with the menu pricing. A "date treat" for myself and my boyfriend as it was a lovely contrast to the hawker market side of Singapore! I loved every second of my evening there due to the level of service from Sithra! She was an amazing host throughout the night, great conversation, genuine humour and we chatted all night long in between meal bites (don't worry, it was encouraged/welcomed so wasn't disruptive at all!). She was great with recommending food and drinks (I only eat fish no other meat so this was a great help also). We skipped starter to keep space for dessert and enjoyed the fish mains and super super enjoyed the desserts! Although we weren't sat right next to the edge, you have a view from within the restaurant and the music choice was a great mix we had more drinks instead of sticking to the plan to move on to somewhere else.After Sithra's shift was finished, she recomended the club side of Ce la vi and convinced us to have a little sneak peak even if we didn't stay long. She took us through to catch the view of the infinity pool and also around the side of the VIP area to sneak a few great shots in of the city. It was wonderful! Her bouncer colleague (Izzy?) was super friendly and funny also and we decided we had to stay for a drink at least and enjoy the people/view/ambiance. (It was too early for me to judge the club overall, it was busy around the VIP areas but not busy enough for a full dancefloor).Overall, a great date night option. 100% will be visiting again
4
I attended Cé la vi and pre-booked a few days beforehand (recommend due to queues). Sevice was first class and staff were very polite and responsive. We were seated within minutes and frequently had service all night. Food was very good quality and presentation was even better with the amount being ample. Our waitress Sitha really was fantastic countlessly making recommendations, and decribing the bed dishes to go for. She even went to the lengths of showing us all the picturesque views from the club area, and made sure staff looked after us for the remainder of the night. The night was unforgettable and she helped make it the perfect
5
We celebrated my friend's birthday here and ordered 2 course set lunch and drinks which the portion totally filled us. The salmon and lamb was cook to perfection and service, especially Ms Rita waited on us with great service but allowing enough privacy. Thank you for the wonderful time - will definitely come back again.
5
Had a very special experience for my first trip to Singapore. Very good food, drinks and service. Take a deep breath, there is a lot to take in, but relax and enjoy it all. I would ask your server to slow down a bit. Sometimes there is a sense that they want to turn the table over quickly and rush you. Also, if you have a special drink request, you might want them to double check as the various bars in the restaurant serve various liquors- Drambuie for one
5
I have always thought that this place would be over the top. However, despite my high expectation, Ce la vi still has managed to exceed it. With a wide range of cocktails, sumptuous desserts and the perfect spot for Singapore sunset, this is the place to be
2
Alarm bell 1: C'est la vie spelled incorrectlyAlarm bell 2: No mention of food in the title of reviews in TripAdAlarm bell 3: No drinks menu provided with the food menuAnd so it was, one very poor meal.My wife and I both ordered the rib eye, medium rare, English spinach and a glass of red wine. English spinach - can't review. It never turned up. Red wine - warm as toast. Unpleasant. Rib eye - was blue, not medium rare. Very unpleasant for a fatty cut of meat. I sent mine back and they put it back on the grill for a while. Second time was better, but it took 10 minutes so my wife and I got to watch other eat, as opposed to eating together. The sauce was basically a heap of cracked black pepper. The steak was not seasoned. The Asian book choy was 'matched' with a French purée and Korean(?) pickled cucumber. Service was very poor, but they tried.An expensive menu in an expensive looking venue but without the food quality to match. Sigh. If you value a view more than food then this place is for you.
3
Not so sure I liked this place. Very busy. Minimal available seats and tables. Bar busy as. Expensive. Views good but can hardly see due to number of people everywhere. Not so sure I'd come back. Probably not.
5
...useless to say, it's a must-go place if you want to spend one evening in a unique location.
Good food (i had the black cod with steamed rice).
Price expensive (menu at 160 dollars without wine) but you pay for the location.
5
Make sure to go to the restaurant if you visit Singapore. Late evening is the best time to visit with stellar view of the Singapore
4
The quality of the restaurant does not do justice to its location and unparalleled views. The menu selection is rather poor an so is the food quality. However as I said this is a must visit place because of where it is. If they could improve their selection and food quality then this would be the best restaurant in tow
3
Of course, the place is a must ! Especially if you can have your dinner outside on the terrace...The food is good but not "to die for". The fish was a bit overcooked. For the price, it's a shame.The view over the city (57th floor !) is breathtaking !Anyhow it's not worth the price for a dinner..
4
I tried to do a bunch of research about what type of view we would have if we ate here, especially since it was their National Day and we wanted to see the fireworks. I even called the restaurant. It is very hard to get handle on this so will share my experience for those struggling with the same thing. First, the seating for the restaurant is largely inside or on the Gardens by the Bay side of the building. So really no view of the bay/city side, which is where the fireworks were. Also, no view down toward the water on the bay/city side since the public viewing area is between the restaurant and the edge of the building. Only a few tables that are on the very edge of the building have an actual view of the Gardens by the Bay and its light show. If you are looking for a view out over the top of the city, you might get this depending on where you sit. No view of the pool. So why spend this much money eating here? Well, the food was pretty good and the desserts fabulous but the service was uninspiring and we were seated outside next to the restaurant bar area - so loud and really no view. By having a reservation you do get to skip the line to go up the elevators to the top. If you are buying a ticket to the public viewing platform, you may have a bit of a wait for the elevators. You can see the pool from the club, so just go in there for a drink and a quick picture. The club looks over the bay/city side of the building, so was a good spot to watch the fireworks. There is a nice spot just across from the elevators to see the Gardens by the Bay light show
5
We had a great evening on top of Marina Sands Bay! We went to ce la vie restaurant - for 20 bucks you get a 20 SGD voucher so you can enjoy the amazing view over singapore while eating and drinking. Our waitress Jain there was great, so kind, polite and attentive :
4
The title pretty much sums it up! Great for watching Singapore skyline, snapping selfies n photos. Patronised by some very pretty customers so the only attractions are not outside!Food is surprisingly not that expensive for its fame but drinks, wine are. We had Italian bottle. Sashimi was presented well with orange pieces, though not conventional tasty. Overall its overcrowded even on weekday, so despite best efforts of staff expect delays. You feel rushed n certainly not a place for relaxed drinks n chitchat. If you love to see, be seen, great
4
This is the place to go if you can't afford to stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and enjoy the views from the rooftop swimming pool. I didn't had the chance to taste the food, but the cocktails are quite nice, all around 20-30 dollars, yet still nothing out of ordinary
4
Go into the hotel and walk all the way to the Tower 3 elevator. There is a desk just outside of the elevator where you purchase your way up to the Sky Lounge, Observation Deck, Ce La Vie Deck. I wanted drinks so purchased the $20 voucher to get up to the 57th floor. This voucher is used towards drinks & food at the bar. The prices are not cheap but the view is worth it. And the Observation Deck is right next to it around the edges of the Sands. NOTE that it's a separate ticket to get onto the Observation Deck. You can still get a good photo of the Gardens by the Bay standing by the edge of Ce La Vie. You'll get some of the deck in your photos but my photos turned out pretty good even with the deck in the bottom of the picture
3
Expensive and very small narrow area. If people cover front row view gets blocked for people at the back. Music wasn't interesting too.
5
The foods and the view was perfect. All above that thank you to Jain who was the waitress of us. She was so kind and helpfull .thanks you for everything..
4
Booked a table for sunset drinks and dinner for my husband and 6 yr old. We were given a choice of table and my husband Picked a small table on the left hand side (if facing towards outside bar). The table was perfect size but the staff were very difficult stating it was only for 2. There was no real issue other then their preference for 2. We sat there in the end and it was lovely.Outside bar area has different menu which they won't combine with the restaurant menu - rigid staff not really wanting the client to maybe order more from both menu?? Working with the customer and being flexible doesn't seem to happen - I guess that's singapore.Food and drinks very good in the restaurant.Only thing is despite you sitting a few metres away you can not go into the observation deck it's $25 pp but silly when by the table it's s slightly elevated view for free- again staff quite rigid
5
We booked months in advance to experience one of Singapore's finest dining experience! The lift to the top is chaotic with finely dressed dinner goers having to mix with sweaty tourists who end up just a floor below the restaurant. We arrived and our table was not ready, the hostess told us that they would open a tab at the bar for us whilst we waited for our "reserved" table. I must say that the view is incredibly something to behold! We got to the bar and to our dismay, the the bar was overcrowded, the tab was not opened and it was evident that the staff was overwhelmed by the number of patrons. We managed to place an order for cocktails! We stood at the bar for 30 mins until we realized that we might be forgotten. I quickly went to the reception to let them know that we are waiting at the bar!! And it was evident that we were old news! They quickly scrambled around and eventually got us a table.Our second round of drinks was brought to our table, we had the sweetest waitress who we gave a beyond generous tip! The food on a scale of 1-10 I give them a 8! Very palatable cuisine! I enjoyed my lamb! Will I ever go there again yes! Just for drinks and the view!
5
We had anniversary celebration at Ce La Vi and the service staff were amazing. The food and view were simply perfect!! It was one of the best dining experience I had. Would definitely recommend Ce La Vi! Also, one of the service staff, Rita, really left an awesome impression. She was so warm and enthusiastic
5
The view of Singapore from this restaurant is outstanding. The staff are very attentive and friendly. The menu is expansive seafood / meat / veg and very creative. The meals are filling and superb in taste. Price wise it is expensive but not over the top considering the restaurants location.Highly recommend for a special occasion or visiting Singapore

Having guests from overseas on their first trip to Singapore, a visit to the roof top of the Marina Bay Sands is a must. So we took them to Ce La Vie that offers excellent food, great service and a stunning view. The evening was windy and we were concerned we would have to move inside, which would have taken away a lot from the experience. Luckily, it remained dry and we left with 2 very satisfied visitors

Customer service in Singapore is usually exceptional. However this place was awful. It is an inconveniance to even ask them a question. Nobody mentions you need a reservation just to sit at the bar area when you purchase a ticket and everything is very overpriced just because of the view. See the view. Eat and drink elsewhere
5
We chose the restaurant for our last night in Singapore and what a great choice it was. The view is spectacular, the food first class. We had the tasting menu with accompanying wine, not cheap but the quality was excellent. The wines complemented perfectly and it made for a great good by to Singapore. We had a couple of cocktails in the sky bar afterwards to seal the evening.I had mentioned when booking that we would be celebrating my son's 21st birthday and without mentioning again the restaurant provided a dessert with candles and piped icing birthday message, very nice touch.Having eaten in similar places (standard rather than altitude!) in London I would say this restaurant more than matches up for the price

Having friends from Europe in town, a visit to the rooftop of the Marina Bay Sands is probably the activity that everyone wants to do.While there are various options how to accomplish this, one of our recommendations is usually to pay a visit to Ce La Vie.While the visit there obviously comes with a price (minimum consumption per person is 80 SGD), so far all of our guests have enjoyed the experience and were happy they went for it!One usually ends up exceeding the minimum price but the choice, quality, presentation of the food, service and of course the view make it a memorable experience worth the money.The menu was nicely split into Sea and Land for Starters and Main dishes, the cocktail list contained some very exotic drink connotations, and the small dessert menu had items like a ‘simple’ fruit platter to share and various types of ice cream with the best strawberry sorbet I ever had.While we certainly won’t go there very often – it is worth waiting a while as the menu does change after a certain period - every now and then with overseas guests or for a very special occasion, we are always happy to come back

We spent an evening at the bar section, the restaurant was fully booked, and our experience could not have been better. We were able to have a great table, with amazing views and the most attentive service possible. Thank you Jain :)

This is a 5-star plus 1-star review, averaging out at 3!Amazing view, clean, comfortable, nice food & drinks. But when you're paying $16+ for a beer, $25+ for a small plate of food, etc, you expect some level of service. While seemingly friendly, the waiters are completely inattentive, having to be called over when we wanted to order drinks & again for food. Also a long wait for food, which was nice when it arrived.I recommend you spend your $20 entrance fee voucher on a drink, soak up the view, but don't bother with the food
2
Some good things first: the appetizer was good, most of the staff friendly and helpful and our wish to change the table was fulfilled rather quickly. Unfortunately the negatives took over most of the evening: the waiters seemed to have no idea and were running around in pure chaos, "coordinated" by an apparently equally confused reservation team.We ordered water which never came and we ordered wine which also never came. Luckily the second time I tried to order water we were lucky enough to get some. Although the majority of the staff was friendly some of the waiters had quite an attitude. The food which should have been the the main attraction next to the view was far from good and absolutely not worth the money. (Vegetables with lemongrass sauce - watery and tasteless) Summing up: this restaurant is pretending to be "high class" and fancy but the emphasis lays on pretending! The only thing that reminds of a fancy restaurant are the prices. The bar in the middle of the ensemble of tables and the music make it very hard to have a decent conversation and the bar is only divided from the dining tables by a small hedge which makes it really uncomfortable to sit there next to people drinking and staring at you eating. What you pay is definitely not good service let alone good food but the view. Suggestion: go and have some amazing and cheap dumplings somewhere in the city and if you really have to go up here then just have a drink at the bar and save yourself some (actually a lot) bucks!!

This is one of the best skyline hotspots for some drinks and food with magnificient skyline views of Central Business District views of Singapore! Its located on 57th floor of Iconic Marina Bay Sands, Tower C. Strongly recomment between 6.30-7.30 to view one of the finest sunsets! This place is certainly one of my all time favourites and strongly recommended for family and friends. Not to forget it is pocket friendly as well
5
This place is a must for anyone visiting Singapore - one to tick off the bucket list. From the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands you have epic views of the city and the restaurant serves delicious food too. Don't be disappointed, book in advance
5
I didn't realise when we make a reservation weeks before we actually travelled to Singapore, that the date we had chosen was their independency day. We chose the Independence day taster menu and were not disappointed, the food was outstanding. ll courses were superb. We were sat outside the main restaurant and the views were spectacular over the city. There was also fireworks during the night as part of the celebrations. My only reservation was that it is attached to a bar area, which was extremely busy (which I suppose is understandable). Outside tables were right upto the bar area so I would advise to request a table away from the bar
4
We really enjoyed our food at CE LA VI and were prepared to pay overs for the tourist experience. The view was fantastic, the staff were great, however they so very busy that it was difficult for them to keep up the frantic pace. Not necessarily a place to go for a romantic occasion
3
Clearly you are paying for the views here, which are great but are also available elsewhere in Singapore. The food is very average (at best) and expensive - you can get much better value/quality elsewhere. Wine is very overpriced, nothing less than $100 per bottle. Service is average. Overall it has a feel of mass catering to it.We brought our three children and I definitely wouldn't recommend bringing your kids - no kids food options.It is fun being on the 57th floor (otherwise I would've given a rating of 2 stars) but I wouldn't recommend it.Note that the views are available from the restaurant but only hotel residents are allowed to access the viewing deck without a ticket at extra cost
5
We booked a table in advance at 6.30- They put us in perfect view of the sunset which was amazing to watch over dinner.The restaurant is a bit odd as it's like an island surrounded by celavi bar and the sky park so there's always people walking around but they can't get in the restaurant itself. The view was partially blocked frequently by people taking selfies but I quite enjoyed people watching.Decor inside is lovely.Service was quick and the food was absolutely amazing.I had the spicy salmon, beef short rib and matcha cheesecake and they were all incredible.We were a little worried about the dress code, it seemed very relaxed but was a Monday when we went- and apparently the dress code is more relaxed.I wouldn't wear shorts or a vest though.Thoroughly enjoyed!Expensive but I'd probably come back again
2
Fantastic view, very good food, a memorable experience ? No.It was like to have a dinner inside a disco, in a very chaotic atmosphere, with a noise music a nd people moving everywhere close to you to take a picure with view .What is wrong? In my opinion they have to found the way to separate the dinner area by the bar area. I visited in the past month other similar restaurant with sky view: in London, Tokio, Bejing and , in all of them, the dinner experience has been fantastic ( maybe the food was worst too) with nice athmosphere,they have organized very defined area : one for drinking with music and one for dinner , more intimate and quiet. I suggest to the management to follow this organization in order to gve the correct value to their fantastic place
5
A group of us gathered here for dinner one night, and we were pleasantly surprised by the food and the quantity.
5
The ambience is beautiful, the food is heavenly and the view is breathtaking. I'm definitely going back.
5
Catch the view of Singapore from the roof top of the MBS.
Cost is $20 pp, but get a $20 voucher for food and beverages. Cocktails are $20-24, so the view + drinks and an awesome view with great vibe.
3
Visited for a business event and must say the views are honestly spectacular! Food and drinks are average, but if you want some great Instagram shots, head here!!
5
Breathless view from CE LA VI, specially in the night... view of marina bay and nice bar at the rooftop at 56th floor
3
Great location lovely view of Singapore.
Service not consistent just like the food.
Not as impressive as the view. Could improve on both service and quality of food.
4
Food was lovely, service was okay. If you are sat outside the view is great however you do get people trying to look at it from the bar over you whilst eating which isn't ideal. Drinks were very expensive. If you want to eat with a view then this will tick that box as the view is amazing. That's was you are paying for really.
4
The place is just amazing! On top of the marina bay sands hotel, the place offers a beautiful view, the restaurant on the terrasse is very pleasant! The food is very good, with a particular distinction for the matcha cheesecake as desert which is excellent! :)The place also has an outdoor bar :) The only thing we can oppose to the restaurant is the price list, which is quite high, even for the quality of the food served and the view offered
1
Very quiet part of the day had lunch and drinks on the rooftop. Attitude from the beginning whilst buying the credit and then terrible service. One meal brought out first then over twenty minutes later the next one.Don't become one of those distant attractions that no one gives a crap about. A forgotten memory as there are already enough of them
5
Being on the top floor of the marina bay sands is only one reason to go, but for the tasty food is another. The ambiance is great as well as a spectacular view of singapore as well as the singapore harbor. The service can be worked on a bit but definitely shouldn't impede your visit. Highly recommended I had some of the best dishes ever here in Ce la vi. The manager is well on top of the situation making sure everything is run smoothly. P.s. The best dessert I ever had is a green tea cheesecake with ice cream and it's worth it to go just for that. A must have
3
Ok so yiu book and turn up suited and booted que up and ride the lift. Arrive and sit in the cage being arched by the zoo visitors .
3
We were told not to miss this place but I can't really recommend, my food was cold and expensive, service was slow and you couldn't really see the view with the amount of people in there. Better to just go for a drink. Sorry
5
Price is on the ex side. But if you are looking for the peak embience and excellent cuisine, this place is a must go for couples!
5
First time in South East Asia and we were welcomed with the breathtaking view of Singapore while enjoying our meal and drinks. More than happy I would say. The food was amazing, the view was double amazing. Thumbs up Singapore!!!!
5
Stunning night views. Food that feeds your soul. Drinks that brings out the rhythm in you. All of a sensational sensory experience never to be missed.
5
Great place! Great food! Great view! Great service! Sincere thank you for the most amazing service to Nabil and Yul. Helping us to celebrate my mom birthday, and it will be her unforgettable memory to have birthday dinner at nice place like Ce La Vi.
3
On top of the landmark for Singapore it could be compared to Alain Ducasse at the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
The views are spectacular and it is well worth going here for a drink but the food is not as exciting as it's French peer.
4
Visited the restaurant for mid-size party dinner. The party course menu we had was tasty, but small portion. I was still hungry after the dinner. I am not sure of the portion of a la carte. Given a great view from the restaurant, overall rating is very good
4
If you want to eat with amazing views go here. You need to book in advance, book at table by the edge and go at night (on a dry night) for the best experience.Food is very good and ambiance bubbly.Not cheap but you pay for the astounding views...and the food is high quality.Wine list is expensive for relatively average bottles and the staff have a constant issue with people at the bar unwittingly sitting at diner tables... but those things aside a recommendation to do
3
We went to the sky on Saturday night. It was my friends 10th visit to Singapore and I thought to go with her to this classy (?) place. In a nutshell, I don't know if I want to go there again. it is not about the cover charge to enter the elevator for the 57th floor. Or the drinks prices atring at 24SD (minus cover charge of 20). Simply, I cannot imagine to go for a romantic dinner, honestly at which table can I have a romantic dinner ? Nope. It says to require smart casual attire but it is simply overrun by tourists and it feels like.We found a place at the corner of the bar and yes, the bar tender was absolutely friendly, happy to assist and recommend. We enjoyed our drinks, enjoyed some views but it was clear that this is a cash machine nthing relaxed like a lounge and it is simply annoying that visitors who consume at the lounge are not admitted at all to walk across the skypark. Simply annoying if you eat, drink and then get stopped by the guy telling you that you need another ticket. Too much tourism here, there are other nice places in Singapore. Good luck ce la vi...
4
We had book a table a few weeks before our trip, and it was a fantastic experience. Very good food, and the view in the evening/sunset is awsome!
5
Everything was begun for a view but the taste of foods is better. Strong taste, nice environment. For a class night, a class place. Only problem is crowd which you couldn't run away in Singapore. A warm congradulation to chef. The Prices are high as expected
3
We booked a table for dinner on Singapore National Day. The bar and restaurant were packed as you would expect. The restaurant gets a 3 star review due to the excellent job the staff did on such a busy day. The views from this restaurant are to die for as it is part of the Marina Bay Sands complex. The only issue was the food. Given that this is a really expensive restaurant in a city famous for its food the quality was poor. The flavours were bland and uninspiring. You left with a large bill and thinking 'I could have done that at home'
5
Definitely one of the most exclusive gastronomic delights I've had in Singapore. Chef Joey did such a great job at matching flavors and executed the dishes to perfection. The foie gras was the most unforgettable for me. The signature dessert was also outstanding. We were served by Ms Shin Yien, she was attentive and not overbearing. Overall, service staff was friendly, well-trained and superb. Of course, the bird’s eye view from the 57th floor was stunning.Lovely food, nice ambience, great service: a must when visiting Singapore!We will definitely come back and recommend this to our friends

Booked this restaurant some time ago as I wanted to celebrate our golden wedding anniversary atop the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. We arrived on time and were crowded into a lift to take us to the 57th floor together with people who were going to the observation deck the floor below. We were taken to our table which regrettably was not at the very edge overlooking the Singapore skyline. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio at $118 and a twelve dollar bottle of sparkling water. The choice of main meal was short rib without the bone for my wife and I had a roast chicken breast, it was a shame to have killed one so young. Both meals were nonetheless appetising with plenty of flavour. We selected two different desserts which we shared between us as we couldn't make up our minds which to have, they were very accommodating in this as they brought two extra plates for our use, they too were excellent. The bitter pill came when the bill arrived, with the obligatory 10% service charge and the 7% GST on top, the total came to almost $300.00 or £168.00. One must suppose that you pay for the view as well as the food. One draw back is that the bar is in close proximity to the dining area and there is an incessant thump, thump, thump of music (sic) being churned out by a DJ
5
We had a delicious meal and exceptional service at the Cé la vi Restaurant.Our waitress, Kate, seemed to anticipate our every need. She was always in the background but on hand when required. It happened to be my daughter's 26th birthday and quite unexpectedly a "Happy Birthday" treat appeared at the end of the meal.It was a perfect evening, made even better by the excellent service we received
4
We went to CE LA VI because of the view from the top of Marina Bay Sands and we were not disappointed. Best views are available if you get a table right by the glass wall. The food was good, very expensive. I liked the fish and the watermelon dessert.The staff was attentive and helpful. It was a nice experienc
3
Of course we had to go up to the Marina Bay Hotel - everybody told us so. And I‘m glad we did. Because the view from up there was stunning! And I understand why you have to make people buy a voucher to get to the bar but it felt a bit like a rip off, since a beer and a glass of wine costed around 50.-. Plus it‘s crowded and you can‘t even get to the edge of the building to take a photo from the view. You would have to buy another ticket for that...If you‘re thinking about going up there because of the view, just buy a ticket from the hotel. If you want to see the view and you are thirsty, go to the bar.
5
We treated ourselves to dinner here while in Singapore and we're glad we did. The view is just stunning, maybe even better at night than during the day, with clear views of three countries: Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. With such a great view it would be easy to serve poor quality food and still do well, but the food and service were exceptional. A real treat, not cheap, but we have paid this price for much more dissapointing meals elsewhere
1
Our firm had a celebratory event at the said restaurant. The event was meant to be for 600 pax but the restaurant was ill prepared, food was definitely not sufficient and the staff was also not adequate. After 1 hour only managed to eat 4 canapé and left hungry...
4
The view from the bar is fantastic and gives it a great ambience. Great cocktails which were refreshing and can get quite packed. Unfortunately, didn't try any food but the drinks were great.
5
We've had an incredible evening here - we found they'd run 300 covers in one evening - so incredible that staff were still so friendly. Food delicious
2
Went to Skybar for a drinkWe expected to pay a premium but drinks a complete rip-off and not great. You cannot get a good view due to crowds and you need too pay to get closer to the edge. This is the poorest Skybar I have been to and would not recommen
5
World-known terrace won't let you down with its amazing view and good quality drinks. Really a pity you have to pay an extra to access the Skypark and fully appreciate the view on the city.Comprehensively the bar will be fairly crowded and the 20$ voucher won't be enough for any drink - efficient and quick service despite this

Ce La Vi is situated at the top of the Sky Lounge at the Mariana Bay Sands. The restaurant is surrounded by the viewing platform which is a floor below and has the restaurant bar area one side and the club lounge on the other.We luckily got a table situated on the outside of the restaurant by the glass over looking the Gardens by the Bay, which is an stunning sight in the evening whilst it's all lit up. However, if we had been sat in the middle of the restaurant then you wouldn't have known you were in a sky lounge as there's nothing to see, and it's quite dark inside. To read the menus they give you a little light that clips on the top otherwise you can't see the page! Similarly is your near to the bar area it's not ideal as there was quite a crowd of people by it which wouldn't be nice when your eating only a few feet away. So definitely request an outside viewing table!The staff were pleasant and friendly, one of them knocked over our wine bottle in the stand which still had about 1/4 of a bottle in. They took it away and came back with a fresh bottle which worked out well for us!!We shared a couple of 'bites' (not entrees), the crispy squid and the Korean boneless wings. They were both delicious but at $48 dollars for the two is a little steep and for the size. For main courses my girlfriend had the Rib eye steak and I had the red snapper which was recommended by one of the bar staff. Both were tasty but they came with very little. Mine was just the fish on a plate and a small bottle of spinach on the side. We order rice too but it was a little bland and more belly fill than anything.Usually my girlfriend and I like to share a dessert as we aren't big into our sweets however we thought best to have one each knowing the main course. I had the banana mouse shortbread style dessert, it was nice but once again, 3 small mouthfuls and it's done. See the photos attached...Overall, I did enjoy the night we have some good food and wine and personally had a great view to look at, but I wouldn't be jumping to go again.

Situated on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands the views are fabulous, the dining experience though was distinctly average, especially considering the premium pricing. I reserved a table requesting a Marina Bay view; upon arrival, there was a long queue at the Ce la Vie reception on the ground floor. As the people in the queue didn’t appear to adhere to the restaurant’s dress code of “stylish chic” I enquired and was informed they were waiting to access the SkyBar which is adjacent to the restaurant. I was ushered to the front of the queue only to find they couldn’t trace my booking; nevertheless, I was permitted to access the lift for the 57th floor. Arriving, there was a further reception who also couldn’t trace my booking; fortunately, I had a copy on my phone and eventually could go to the SkyBar for a drink. First disappointment! There is no separate bar for Ce la Vie and the SkyBar was sufficiently packed we were unable to sit. Two S$23 Gin and flat tonics later we requested to sit at our table which, in fairness, was exactly what I asked for with fabulous views over Gardens by the Bay. We were introduced to our server and proceeded to order. We only had the table for two hours and given the speed of the service (leisurely) I wasn’t convinced we would be have sufficient time to enjoy the courses. The menu was varied and of reasonable quality, at these prices however, I was expecting something exceptional and sadly this was not to be the case. The lighting around our table was very subdued, to the extent that we couldn’t really see what we were eating, following a request a table lamp was provided which really didn’t improve matters.It seems to me that Ce la Vie is relying too heavily on it’s wonderful vistas at the expense of the food and service. Our bill was just short of £100 per person including the obligatory 10% service charge and local taxes. My overall impression was one of lack of supervision and poor attention to detail; shame really as it has all the potential to become a top-class restaurant

Visited here late July 2017. Restaurant is very dark, hard to see and lacking atmosphere. Staff seem very stressed and not so friendly.Its expensive, food and wine very costly and not worth the cost. I had the Braised rib, its a tiny portion, I love fine dining but this was riduculous, would eat three of them and not fill me. It was very greasy, left a bad taste in the mouth. I tried to complain but the waitress was in too much of a hurry to listen.Partner had Onion lemon chicken which was delicious but again a tiny portion and it costs a fortune.€15 small glass of wine €6 water€30 TINY braised rib, terrible value for money, quality and cost.I had to wait until I was paying the bill before I got a manager to complain about the braised rib, he deducted it from the bill, which was something.I wont be returning
5
The view of this place is fantastic. We were lucky and were able to have a table just at the edge but there are not that many in the bar section so be there early if you want to see the sunset and light show. We had some cocktails and sushi, both really good. You have to come here if you are in Singapore
4
The cocktails are innovative and refreshing for the hot climate. Grilled prawns and Balinese sambal was fab but not authentic. The view and ambience are the stars here. I had to ask for a menu, then after waiting 20 min I went to the bar to order. The bar tenders were efficient, the waitress bored tired lazy or all 3 and it was quiet! My rating goes to the view and the cocktails and well worth i
3
I've only been here for drinks. It's the "it" place to take out of town visitors for the vibe and view. Great view without a doubt but overpriced drinks and service that is used to catering to tourists. Frankly, i think it's a little over-rated but my visitors seem to enjoy it
5
Sitting outdoors you will have an exceptional view of Singapore. But the food here is great too. A mix of classic European cuisine and Asian influences. The restaurant is expensive though
5
I thoroughly recommend you include dinner at this restaurant on your Singapore holiday. The food was stunning and the buzz is amazing . I recommend the scallop and oyster ceviche which was mind blowing. Atmosphere is buzzing and the views at night are breathtaking.
5
Very nice place to visit especially if you are staying at the marina bay sands hotel. The view and there service are really good. This is where you should go on an evening out in Singapore.
2
+ Great location & views.+ Good food and drinks.- Had to wait 20mins for a table for two that we had booked/reserved prior and waited over and hour for our main course! -Trying to find staff that are available for a drinks menu was impossible.-Clearly the venue is under staffed on a Saturday night including the chef's kitchen. -The service and response from staff & management when we politely complained left us feeling disappointed overall
2
Very poor experience from the queue and interaction with staff at ground floor, nowhere available to Sit upstairs (why was there a queue then?),adding tax to the drink prices (really!?) and generally unsmiling staff. I don't blame them - to work in that zoo must be unpleasant. Many better places to go if you want see the view and experience sing hospitality and soak up the atmosphere. The attitude seemed to be let's get as many people in to the venue as quickly as possible. Won't be going back - ever
5
A must place while in Singapore! Ce la vi is a romantic environment with breath taking views of the city and skyline. The food is pretty delicious as well as the drinks. I will suggest to make a reservation before going, it will make your stay easier. Also there is a bar outside the restaurant with good views too, it is a good choice if you dont want to pay a little extra. Also you can check the menu online!
5
It seems TripAdvisor have kinda mixed the three together. Not really fair, as they are different experiences. I will focus on Skybar and Club Lounge.1) Dress code applies, although there are 'casual' nights - check the website, and pay attention to whether you are looking at the Skybar, Club Lounge, or restaurant. 2) Pay $20 downstairs. This goes towards your drink, which will total around $28 after plus plus taxes3) Get in before 6pm if you want a seat by the edge of the building for sunset4) The half-undercover 'southern' side of the bar (Club Lounge) has a much better view than the alfresco more northern side (Sky Bar). They are separated by the elevator, so just walk around behind it. Some people miss this5) The 'southern' side gives you a view of that elusive infinity pool next door6) Staff will keep filling your bowl with wasabi crisps if you ask7) Although that might be an expensive cocktail, this is a must-do and you will probably only do it a couple of times in your life. A beer at an Irish pub in SG will cost you $15 anyway8) The bathroom is 'behind' you, behind where you exited the elevator. You will see a viewing platform looking over Gardens by the Bay and the Supergrove. If you are here around 8pm, you can elbow in and watch the light show on the grove. I mean, you're here anyway
5
Sometimes you look forward to an experience for a long time and it turns out negative. Naturally expectations for a restaurant on the 58th floor on Marina Bay Sands will be high. But - be assured - there were only positives during our visit AND a lot of them.1) Reservation on the Web was easy and we got the outside table at the "edge" we had asked for2) Check in service at Level 0 is smooth, friendly and effective3) Warm welcome on Level 58 at arrival4) Even warmer welcome by the hosts at our table5) Magnificant view of the Bay and the Singapore Flyer - we were like kids in a candy store. View was beyond description6) Drinks, wine and food were perfect. The lobster (SGD 88,- ) is huge and worth tthe price7) Service could not be better8) Price was not enormous - the restaurant is really affordable Enjoying the view and all the other happy guests during our 2 hour stay made our visit to Singapore perfect.I can not recommend enough - also for ffamilies with teens

Ce La Vi is born with a great view which is why everybody goes, so that is a given but it is nevertheless awesome.We booked through our hotel and especially asked for a table at the edge of the restaurant. If that was not available, we would rather go another night, but the table was confirmed. We also received a lengthy email regarding dress code, access of children etc. etc. However, when we arrived, we were shown to - probably - the worst table of the restaurant far from a view of anything. Only after my husband made quite a scene were we moved to a better table but still not as we had booked.Our food was a very long way underway, and our waitress apologised for this several times and she was very attentive. When food eventually arrived, it was excellent and worth the wait.PS - When we arrived back at our hotel, they called from Ce La Vi to ask about something we had forgotten there. The item was not ours but showed concern so the call was appreciated as attentive service
4
We booked a table for 5 and specifically asked for a table with a view of the bay. We were obviously very lucky to get one outdoors overlooking the Gardens by the Bay, I would have been less impressed with one of the tables inside as really the whole point of this experience was to eat overlooking the city.We had a drink first - bar area incredibly busy and all the seats were taken. More people coming in than leaving - understandably those who had seats were making their drinks last Our waitress Jess was very friendly and helpful.The food was good with an outstanding soup. Eye watering prices for drinks especially the wine but you're paying for the location . The views definitely made the whole night worthwhile
5
Awesome view from the top, nice choice on the menu. Price is reasonable. Staff very friendly and helpful. Lovely experience. Thrilled to be there.
5
Amazing 57roof top bar CÈ LA VI but really high price .
Good service and security all friendly.
You should go explore one is you can.
5
Had our honeymoon dinner here, booked a few months in advance and got the table we wanted over looking the gardens by the bay etc. Food was good, service was great, would highly recommend it.
5
go to after gambling hangout (if i win). unbeatable views. beautful people. good place for after work drinks as well.
4
Perfect place for a drink and enjoy the panoramic view of Singapore, from CBD view to Gardens by the Bay in the afternoon.
4
You will not have a great view while seating unless you request the few tables that has a view towards the back of the Sands Hotel. However you will be allowed to arrive earlier and stay after dinner enjoy the view from the top of the hotel. Service provided by Jess was perfect. The food was very good but not outstanding. The advantage is that again you can enjoy the view from the top of the hotel without having to pay separately to have access to the top. Ia a warm day make sure you dress light as the AC works but the restaurant is in an open area
4
The service provided by our waitress Rita was exceptional. She was readily happy to serve and genuinely friendly. Food was nice but be advice that it wont come cheap. The view is probably the most rewarding experience of the evening. 60% of the tables are alfresco, which wont be too much of an issue if there is a light breeze going
4
Last month my friends and I spent few days in Singapore. We went to Ce La Vi for lunch and enjoy the view from the top. I thought restaurant and the bar were the same but, I totally wrong. They were separated and had different menu. So, we ate lunch first then Enjoyed the view after ward. Food was good and pretty. Our waitress also quite nice. I didn't like the security they weren't nice. I heard from my friend better to come to this place at night because they have live music.

Great views must say. The service was pretty poor, example my dad got a Beer (usually they bring you a glass so you can decide whether you want to drink it with the glass or from the tap) but they didn't bring even a glass. My sprite was ok. Very bad service for the price, but nice views

I've been here several times. I must say the hostesses on the ground floor before the lifts to go up to the restaurant are all skimpily dresses. Does not give a good impression at all.Ce La Vi has a beautiful view over Singapore especially in the evening. It would be better if they had some sort of crowd control. The terrace outside was packed and mainly with tourists taking photos of the view rather than having something to eat or drink at the restaurant.I stayed at MBS and also made a reservation at this restaurant. We were dressed nicely but saw other guests dressed down. It was not the dress code required at the restaurant and yet still be able to dine there. We had a few dishes to share as recommended by the waiter who served us. Also took a bottle of red wine. I must say the wine card was crazily overpriced. Cocktails were unique and well presented. Some had influences of Asia - A must try!I came here again with a group of friends. Reservation was made via phone few days before. I was told that I could only stay at the table until 9pm and he was not very kind. Food was nicely presented but served without letting us know what is what. The waitress even mixed up two of our main courses

Excellent service & food.
Our waitress Mavis was excellent.
The views are spectacular over looking the gardens & city.

We were so lucky to have had a beautiful dinner at Ce La Vie Restaurant Singapore on the 57th floor, to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary. We had a really Great Table on the very Outside, with Un-Obstructed views of the Skyline & Singapore Lights. First of all we had drinks at the Bar to get us in the Mood for a super night.Our Meal was lovely, and we had Wonderful service from 3 of the great Staff, namely RITA, RAJ & PJ the Guest Service Executive, they all looked after us so much to celebrate our Special 40th. They also brought us a Special Plate after our meal with the Sparkler alight on a plate of Piped Meringue with Fresh fruit coulis coated over the Top & a beautiful piped Chocolate sauce Happy 40th Anniversary piped onto the plate, a Lovely touch - Thank you once again PJ, Rina & Raj for making our evening such a lovely memorable occasion x We will be Bac

We had an unforgetable dinner there as the quality of the food couldn't have been higher and it was perfectly cooked. moreover, after the dinner we took some cocktails enjoying the views of Singapure centre. Of course, the restaurant is pricey, but it's well worth the mone
5
We booked our table a few days ahead for 7 pm so we could enjoy the sunset over the amazing skyline. We recommend asking for an outside table so you have an unobstructed view. Do not worry, the night air is warm and perfectly still, even on the 57th floor. We had cocktails at 6 on the deck to enjoy the extraordinary view and busy gathering of people. It is easy to stroll around and take snaps of the skyline.The restaurant Ce La Vi had an imaginative menu. It was hard to choose. All the food was extraordinary making for a most memorable evening. Our server, Shin Yien was knowledgeable and met all our expectations. After dinner we went for drinks at the Ce La Vie Lounge and to watch the laser show over the water starting at 9pm. We had a table at the edge so thoroughly enjoyed the view.We recommend this restaurant for all to celebrate the pleasure of being in such a beautiful city

CE LA VI is a restaurant type bar located on the 57th floor of MBS. One strong advice. Always make a reservation if you plan to go. Food quality is decent but not the best. Portion is small and price is on the high side. Overall 3.5/5Ambience and view 4.5/5.Staff service 4/5 (Very friendly and professional waiters and Receptionists

Last #dinner on my trip to SG, decided to give a shot at a very renowned restaurant on the #rooftop of Marina Bay Sands hotel. A little troublesome to get to the peak due to the long queue of people keen to enjoy SG view either from level 56 (skypark) or level 57 where the restaurant locates. Initial service was rather slow since a lot of guests were making their orders. By and large after over a quarter hour, I managed to make my own order. Then there were my foods coming: started with Prawn and pomelo salad, main course of delectable medium-rare ribeye steak, and I had chocolate cake with whiskey ice-cream. The somellier chose a perfect Australian #Shiraz #redwine for me. Foods were wonderful. Hence, despite the initial not-so-wonderful experience, I still would give this restaurant a review of being recommended, particularly to ones want to see luxuriously luminous SG - the metropolitan city - from a different point of view. #marinabaysands #Celavi #cÃ¨lavisg #foodie #foodgasm #foodlover #foodporn #foodblogger #SicilianPrawn #Prawn #Steak #RibeyeSteak #somellier #SingaporeFineDining #Finedinings

Having dined here a few times, I now take out of town friends for the view, buy them a weak and over priced cocktail, take their photo and leave.Under no circumstance do I recommend eating in the most uninspired restaurant in town, that for pure real estate, feels it can charge whatever it wants.A huge shame. MBS is home to some of the best meals I've eaten in Singapore, yet the prime spot with iconic postcard views let's itself down with arrogant fools behind the bar, and bored chefs whose creative days seem far behind them.In short, go for the view and then go somewhere else for dinner
2
Ce La Vi is all hype - highly disorganised and badly coordinated service, with service staff running around like headless chicken, some with radioes and headphones in their ears, making it look like they part of the secret service or the security detail of a high risk VIP. If you are going there for the view, beware, if they seat you in the centre there is no view - all you see are tables of diners around you.I took my wife there for a romantic dinner but the atmosphere is too chaotic - you have to shout at each other to be heard. This may be a weekend thing but the staff should have made it clear at the time of reservation
4
The food here is very good and by Singapore fine dining standards not badly priced. I did find the service a little wanting - they seemed very keen to get us in and out very quickly even though we had a 2 hour window for our table - we did feel a bit rushed and our mains were ready before we had even finished our entrees

Dined with a girlfriend for a birthday. For a start tried to reserve online via chope which I have used successfully with other restaurants. Got no response, so tried direct through Ce la vi website, again no response. Eventually rang them and was able to secure a table. They said they would email a confirmation but it was never received. I mentioned it was for a birthday so was pleased to be seated outside on the deck, but we wern't right at the edge so it was difficult to get a shot of the view. I had a drink at the bar beforehand which was lovely but crowded and they had a whole section blocked off which is disappointing when you are paying top dollar at the restaurant. The food is fantastic, as are the staff, but the little extras are missing, no bread for example, no birthday treat which many Singapore restaurants do so well. Ce la vi doesn't have to try to hard, as there are plenty of punters lining up to get in. It's a shame because a little more care and thoughtfulness would have made it the perfect night
5
I f you're staying at MBS hotel, this is a must go place. The views of the garden are amazing..its nice and windy..and at night the music is amazing !! the seating is comfortable !!
5
Absolutely great experience to dine at Ce La Vi.
Food was excellent, service was excellent- thankyou Rita for looking after us for the evening!
5
It was my first dining experience at the restaurant. And i must say, the service has certainly exceeded my expectation. My friends and I were so happy, we were given seats with the best view of the city, and i would specially like to mention Rita, who was our server for the night. She was especially thoughtful and i like how she was genuine. Indeed an asset to the company!
3
We booked a table at sunset. The venue itself has a wonderful aspect. Menu wise, we ordered the 'Tasting Menu' . Your paying good money so We were expecting better quality to be honest. The bar staff are overstretched. A few 'tweaks' would make it all it wants to be.
4
Our business guests were impressed by the impressive evening view of the sea, Gardens by Bay, Singapore Flyer while dining at Ce La Vi Restaurant.Dishes recommendations by the crews were excellent.Spicy Salmon Sushi Roll with Smoked Chipotle Pepper was so tasty that our guest ordered a second plate! I would return for the Slow Roasted Black Cod. Overall, ingredients and dishes were fresh and satisfying during our visit. Desserts were beautifully presented, only that we had a different preference with regards to the flavor blending. Wine and champagne library was good, while coffee grade can be improved.Service crews were very helpful and did their best about our requests with regards to table changes. We could enjoy dinner at the outdoor seats and desserts at the indoor seats. After dinner, Ce La Vi generously granted us entry to Club Lounge for a quick city view appreciation. Together with our guests, we could enjoy best entertainment of 3 worlds
3
To save myself the $50 for a beer and frozen margarita I would have gone elsewhere. The service is terrible and you fight every other person for the view, needless to say you can no long get close to the edge as this is reserved to hotel guests.

Reading Tripadvisor reviews about individual experiences for CE LA VI you get the feeling its going to be a hit or miss affair, understandably given its location and popularity with tourists and hotel guest all wanting that one magical Instagram / Facebook profile pic.Our personal experience was nothing short of AMAZING.Last night, arriving early to ensure we allowed time for any short delays, we were pleasantly surprised by the seamless friendly service and we were seated for pre dinner drinks at the Sky Bar area in no time. We found a seat no problem and settled in for our first round of drinks whilst soaking up the atmosphere.Our dinner sitting was from 630-830 At 630 one of the staff escorted us to our table in CELAVI Restaurant, and this is where our experience continues. The staff were outstanding, very attentive, engaging and friendly from the onset.We ordered the norm - entrÃ©es, mains and desserts. The presentation, food quality and most importantly the taste of every dish was excellent. Each dish was served in a timely manner, at no time did we feel rushed or pressured to vacate our table. We even took a break between the main and desserts to go take photos of the views, coming back to complete our dinner in our own time.On completion of our dinner we made our way to the CE LA VI Club Lounge where we took in more views and enjoyed the relaxing atmospherics.Over all we had an AMAZING experience, Fantastic meal and a High-light magic evening.I would like to note that our experience was made even more special by the Amazing staff, thankyou to our wait-staff Raj and Olivia, you guys rocked.A very special thankyou to Suzette who made our Dinner a memorable one with her personalised touch, a big thankyou. Yes there a crowds, yes it is busy, if you are doing the tourist experience then expect the tourist lines and time delays.People vent about prices at CELAVI, honestly it is not that much difference from any high class venue or quality restaurant in Singapore / Australia / Around the world.Do your homework and you wont be disappointed
5
What an amazing night at Ce La Vie last night! After reading a few negative reviews my expectations were low however, our experience was fantastic. From the moment we arrived til the time we left our whole experience went smoothly. The food was amazing and the portion sizes were good. Yes, it's expensive but it's on par with all top restaurants in a great location around the world. Special thanks to Suzette, Olivia and Raj for fantastic service and of course the Chef for an amazing dinner. I don't understand how anyone could give this restaurant a negative review.

First off, the view you will get from the terrace at this restaurant at night is awesome, worth the effort if for nothing else.The atmosphere is vibey and busy, very nice, but seating is limited and you can only smoke sitting at the tables at the edge of the terrace, so this is a bit frustrating - the place is cery full, so you will have to be patient if you are a smoker.The food is EXCELLENT, we had the tamahawk steak, excellent if you are a meatlover, I come from a country with excellent meat quality, but this was next level!The Korsan fried boneless chicken was also out of this world, had it as a starter, would eat shovels full every day...excellent. The dessert we had was the hazelnut and chocolate cake with salted caramel and some extra love, this was also to die for, my wife wanted to lick her plate (she is normally a lady of better taste).Wagyu beef carpaccio and codfish also gets an honourable mention.Only downside, the staff werent super friendly, I think the night we were there was just too busy for the amount of people working that shift...but they didnt punch us in the face and chase us away either...it was just ok.Loved this place, would take friends there to share the experience any time

I booked a table at this restaurant for my husband and I for the last night of our visit to Singapore, expecting it to be THE highlight of our trip. However, we were incredibly disappointed. We were unfortunate that, having had beautiful weather for 5 days and, having spent our last day enjoying the same, in the time it took us to go up in the lift in the Marina Bay Sands, the heavens opened. Now, obviously, the restaurant is not responsible for the inclement weather, but the whole point of going to Ce la Vi was to experience the views. In spite of the rain, we would have still liked to take some photos but were told we couldn't go outside to the viewing area for safety reasons. However, guests who were actually staying in the hotel had no such restrictions and were able to go out and take photos. Very annoying. Apart from this, food was poor and service just ok. All in all, a very disappointing - and expensive - evening out. Expensive I expected, but not the standard of food and customer service
4
This is one of the most amazing fine dining restaurant and the view is spectacular at the top. The food are too elaborate but the pricing are too steep. It is worth every penny for the ambience and the taste of western fusion fine dining.
1
U want fantastic night from rooftop, and great ambience with food quality and taste compromised, then for here! Salty food, with lots of soy sauce, sesame etc,...never will we go to this place again!
5
Very luxury restaurant. The ambiance was perfect, foods and service also great. We celebrated my birthday it was really unforgetable. Prices were very expensive but tottaly deserved.
1
Understood that Ce La Vi had just undergoing massive change so I was intrigued to give it a try. It was pretty disappointing, there was little connection from the whole meal, there was ceviche but there was also laksa (or was it chicken rice? It certainly came with heap of rice..). Dessert was horrible. Considering I have just eaten there two weeks back, I have hard time remembering what I have eaten. It was that bad
1
We wanted, as everybody else, to enjoy the great view of the Marina bay sands with a good meal. So we booked a table at the CE LA VI. When we got there 10 minutes early we were asked to wait in the bar for the table to get ready, which in itself is OK. But the bar was overcrowded and the service was terrible, and the overpriced drink tasted more like a kids mix of soda than a drink in a fine bar. When we finally got our table we ordered one starter to share, and two main courses. The waiter delivered an OK starter, but messed up the order for the main course. We ended up sharing one main course. She tried to fix the order, but then it turned out that they were empty of the dish we ordered, so we had to order a different dish, a more expensive one than the first. Considering the circumstances we would expect CE LA VI to give us some sort of discount, for example offering dish number 2 to the same price as the original dish we ordered, or maybe free dessert. The only discount we had was the side order (French fries) for free. We ended up paying more for a 3 course meal in Singapore than we do for a 5 course meal in Norway (and as you know Norway is quite expensive compared to other countries). We kept polite and friendly through the whole stay, but the waiter seemed so embarrassed that se didn’t make any eye contact with us the rest of the stay. We expected the prices at this place to be high, but also the service to match the prices. Because of the bad service we feel tricked and would NOT recommend anyone to eat at CE A VI
3
No arguing the views are great. Been up there on the weekend and also during 2016 F1. Shame the drink prices are so expensive and you get the feeling of being rushed if you are sitting on your drinks. Clearly a popular and busy icon. Won't be rushing back during 2017 F
1
I first dined at Ce la Vie in 2016 and had an exceptional experience...not sure what has happened in the meantime as I have never been so disappointed with food and service in July 2017. At the 8.30 pm sitting the sauce on the entree was thick and lumpy, the dishes luke warm. The fish dish was overcooked and dry - inedible..The main courses arrived whilst we were still eating the entree. The drinks were super expensive and well beyond a reasonable mark up. The front of house service was efficient and friendly but the rest of the service was suboptimal. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant with very limited view. We would have been better off having a snack in the Sky Bar where at least we would have a view and better service
2
The views from the bar are great but the price of the drinks is a rip off. When choosing your drink from the menu beware that the price quoted bears no resemblance to the price you are expected to pay. The view is superb but the bar is over crowded and over price

We were visiting Singapore from the UK as part of our travels around Asia. We decided to take a trip up the Marina Bay Sands hotel, to take in the view of Singapore at night and decided we would want to eat too. We made a reservation that morning for a Saturday night and luckily they had a table free. Do book ahead though if you can as I'm not sure this is always the case! We had a drink at the bar beforehand and sat at a table at the edge. It is evidently busy but tables do pop up so hold your turn and you will get a chance to experience the view with nothing in front of you! It's a good atmosphere up there too, buzzing and good music. We sat down to eat at a beautiful table for two on the decking overlooking Gardens by the Bay. I would highly recommend eating on the decking if you can, so you can fully appreciate the view and take advantage of a warmer climate! As it was our anniversary and a special treat, we both ordered the five-course tasting menu. Whilst more than your average meal, it did not disappoint and was great value for money. The ingredients were high quality, ranging from scallops and crabmeat to ibérico pork and steak. It was all excellently executed - beautifully cooked and looked as exquisite as it tasted.We both drank wine, and the two we sampled both complimented the food and were lovely to taste. We aren't massively knowledgeable about wine, but it tasted delicious and there was plenty of choice on the menu. Service was wonderful. Our waitress was attentive, well informed and not overbearing. Leo, the manager, was so friendly and made the experience very personal and memorable. What a wonderful team at Cé La Vi. It was a lovely touch to have a surprise anniversary dessert. By this point we were so full but there is always room for something so tasty. We had cocktails after dinner at the bar. A table was sourced for us which was another tick for service. The cocktails were really good and finished off our evening. It is certainly one we will remember for a very long time. Do go if you are able. You won't regret it one bit. Many thanks again to the wonderful staff for making it so memorable. We hope to return sooner rather than later.

I met with some friends and had a late lunch and I'm guessing because the restaurant wasn't so busy we had the pleasure of meeting the chef during the meal. We had lots of plates to share and the food was excellent. Everything we ordered as beautifully presented and tasted amazing. I took several photos.. although I'm not certain I got all the descriptions right... I would highly recommend eating here. I'd be back next time I visit Singapore. Service was spot on too. The outside bar was busy but looked like a tourist destination with lots of people in vests and shorts with backpacks taking ages over their drinks. If I wanted to enjoy a bottle of wine with friends during the day this would put me off to be honest
4
We went there expecting a glimpse of the view, but we were seated too far off (though still nice). However, the food was incredible. All seafood produce was super fresh and pampered your pallet. Try to book before sunset to enjoy more!
5
Great restaurant, amazing glamour and high end service makes it special occasion dining. Very smart crowd, recommend changing for dinner after the office.
4
Me and my friend went for a very random dinner to CÃ‰LAVI last week, before drinks. It was not planned and we all know how difficult it is to get tables for dinner there.However the team was super helpful and got us a beautiful table in minutes.Our order:Salt & Szechuan pepper crispy squid with a sour tomato dipSashimi of marinated HamachiWarm citrus cured Tasmanian salmonSlow Roasted Black CodCoriander crusted rack of lamb & braised ribsMolten matcha cheesecakeand finally :)Lemongrass white chocolate shellThe food was just AMAZEBALLS! The view was great too... nothing to complain... only praises
3
Went for a drink before dinner elsewhere. You have to pay 20 dollars to get up there but your receipt is redeemable for drinks and food. As the cocktails are 24 each, you will end up spending that much anyway. And the Observation Deck is 23 dollars, so you might as well get the same exact view with a drink in hand. The view is pretty much the same as the observation deck except that the deck is in the foreground of many pictures. The service was fast but a bit pushy. We were made to feel as it they wanted to get us out as quickly as possible so we could be replaced by new customers. It is very much a tourist trap of a sort, but the Bellinis were good and if I could afford dinner there, I would try it
4
Even as someone who lives in singapore I could appreciate the great views of the city. For a tourist visiting singapore it would be a great experience if you are looking to do something a bit special. The menu is a bit pricey but to be expected for the location and everything we ordered was delicious. Portions are on the smaller side but we had 2 courses each and left feeling satisfied
5
This was one of our highlights of our trip. Spectacular food with unbelievable views. Excellent service and definitely worth a visit
4
Saw the Sands for the first time when we took the evening cruise. It was stunning as the hotel was very much more swivels lit up , mind you almost all of the skyscrapers were competing for your attention.Anyway, as we came in the early afternoon, we got lucky and had a table straight away overlooking the merilion and the Fullerton.Oh to score this experience, you will shell out $20SGD a head and an access to the bar. Do be patient as the cues on the ground floor can be long. Once you get the ticket, they have a 10$ voucher per ticket that you can spend on your tipple or food.So once you get yourself seated, the cocktails will cost you 24$ per order. Recommendation:Good camera, iPhone, and hold on to dear life as it can be dizzingly scary looking down form the 57th floor. From the top facing the city you can see the merilion, Chinatown, Clark quay
5
My husband and I had a short lay over in Singapore on our way back to Australia, so we decide to go check out ce la vi for a drink at sunset. We were welcome by francis, very nice and smiley bartender. I ordered a margarita (my favourite cocktail). My husband is not a fan of cocktails, but francis was quick to recommend a sunrise with strawberry, pineapple and tequila, which he liked! We will definitely visit again on our next stop over, the view was to DIE for, really enjoyed the atmosphere and definitely want to try the food there. It looked amazing
4
The views are just absolutely stunning, make sure you reserve a table on the outside decking. Just be aware of a few things! Reserving a table doesn't gain you entry, you have to pay $20SGD per person just to get up to the bar/restaurant. This only gains you access to one side of the deck, unless you are a hotel guest. Therefore you are unable to see the entire view (quite annoying). The prices are crazily expensive, $25 SGD for a pint of Stella beer, the cocktails are not very alcoholic and around the same price. Over $100 SGD for a bottle of wine. The food was good, may just be better to go up for a drink or two and soak up the views. Service was just OK. Would recommend mainly for view
5
The view is obviously incredible, but for a very popular rooftop bar it is surprisingly relaxed. Its not cheap, but worth a visit. I think its better than the viewing deck
5
This place is expensive, no doubt about that... but you get what you pay for. I went here as a special treat with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The service received from all staff was exceptional, the view was beautiful, and the food was delicious. The service is possible the best I have received in Singapore, they even greeted us with a friendly 'happy anniversary' when we arrived, and then with dessert they wrote 'happy anniversary' on our plate in chocolate, which was a very lovely touch, it was nice they had noted down on our reservation that we were there for a special occasion, it really made us smile and feel like a special guest, and made our experience memorable
5
This was a special occasion for us as our daughter and her boyfriend were with us and he chose this setting to propose which, luckily, was accepted. He had spoken to me beforehand so I arranged with the staff for an outer table on the SE side. The view of the sea traffic and the super trees lit up in the Gardens By The Bay, was spectacular. We left them to have their moment before returning later to help celebrate. The staff were very helpful in organising the setting and being subtly on hand with the champagne at the right moment. Beyond this though, I should say that the service was excellent, we were thoroughly 'looked after' leaving us with nothing but happy memories. I am sure the kids will treasure this evening.We had a wide variety of dishes from Tuna Tartare, Foie Gras, Roasted Lemon & Honey Chicken, Snapper (lemongrass, tumeric and kecap manis) and Ribeye (sweet potato noodles, doenjang and kimchee). All were prepared to perfection. Not an off-note in the entire evening - just what you would expect from a first class dining establishment in the premier position in the Marina Bay Sands. Highly recommended
5
Recently back in Singapore for meeting friends, we were looking for a great place to spend good time. Me and my wife went for a very lovely dinner in the newly renovated restaurant... the bar is totally outstanding, so beautiful and so is the food of new arrived in town chef Joseph (the slow cooked black cod is to die for!)After dinner we went to have a drink and meet our friends on the terrace.We trully have good time and this won't be possible for the impeccable service of Suzette who truly take perfect care of us...The whole night was perfect and we were so sad to leave the place! Next time we will definitely come back!!
4
Achieved a new record so the team went to Ce La Vie for dinner. The view is amazing and the service is great. The cod was delicious and so was the passion fruit coconut dessert. I would recommend this restaurant just for the views alone but I must say that the food is tops as well
5
We had diner there and the view was spectacular! The food was created with finesse and tasted very delicious! Service was excellent and very customer oriented! We were there very late (22:30) due to a late flight without a reservation. They were so friendly and helpful and made it happen for us. Even when my credit card had issues at the end, the staff was so friendly and helpful that it is worth to mention it once more. Back to the food and I must say this chef uses excellent fresh products and knows how to use them! Fine dining with a spectacular view and excellent service made it a great evening for us. This is a must place to have diner! Afterwards you can have a drink at the SkyBar to continue into the night
5
We decided rather than pay to go on the observation deck for MBS it made sense to have lunch one floor higher and get virtually the same view.The set lunch was good value (with a special priced house wine if wanted). Just a little surprised that rice was extra (and all our meals required a side dish). We were there on a rainy and cloudy day, but it cleared up after lunch which meant we could take in the view for free. If you want to see the infinity pool, you need to walk around to the pool/city view side of the restaurant
4
This is the best way to get to the top of the Marina Sands skypark and have a very nice meal and get a great view of the whole area. You have to pay $20 for the access, but this goes toward a drink or meal in the restaurant. The food is quite good and there is a good menu to choose from with daily specials. This would be your best experience in Singapore and you will leave feeling you had a good time and great view of the whole area
5
What a fantastic way to end the day! Cocktails beside the pool, overlooking the city and watching Singapore light up at night. Very tasty bar meals and very attentive service
2
The view was worth it, but would recommend skipping this whole place and just doing the skywalk viewing. The staff were extremely inattentive, found chatting in the corner when numerous people were waiting to be served. The food came out 20 minutes apart, despite asking about it. We were just told that it was coming.Rude waiter rolled his eyes as us when we arrived. So disappointing as it's an exquisite place for a bar and could be amazing with improved service
5
EAST meets WEST is the base for the food menu and that was a perfect combination of food form both continents 
5
My bf and i reserved for dinner and was greeted and directed to our table. It was the best seat. The food was superb. We ordered the scallop and oyster ceviche and mushroom dumplings for starter, ribs and ribeye for mains and was served with this amazing dessert. Has a bottle of good wine too. The staffs were friendly and they will chitchat with customers. I will definitely come back and list this place as one of our fave. Shout out to onad lopez and suzette for taking care of us during our visit.
4
The whole ambiance and feeling was wonderful with the food being superb, look forward to returning when we do our annual food pilgrimage to Singapore
5
this view is amazing and the food and service was also great. Definitely worth a visit. There are some areas that are reserved for hotel guests which is frustrating if you are not a guest - but I can understand
5
It's on the 57th floor. Aerial view of the city. The infinity pool there is just awesome. Try chilled coconut water. It's awesome.Too expensive but awesom
5
Lovely atmosphere combined with a wonderful view. We really appreciated the taste of all dishes. Please try the steamed crab & shrimp dumplings and the slow roasted black cod. Top
5
The restaurant serves lunch sets that are reasonable, what's more is the good view that comes with it. Very good for romantic dinne
5
No cueing at the entrance, no entry fee, reasonable prices and tasty cocktails - I was positivel suprised, taken the fame of the place. We even found free seats and enjoyed the incredible view on the skyline and the marina
5
Been longtime I didn't go to Celavi but heard a lot of good comment about the new renovated restaurant and decided to bring along my client for a business lunch. Was not disappointed at all as food was well balance, refined and tasty. Service was high class and precised without to being too much. The manager on duty Suzette was on top of her game, very class and her service was on the spot. Her food recommendation was excellent. We also able to meet the executive Chef Joseph who completed our entire experience. Will definitely recommend and come back. Thank you to Ce La Vi Team
5
I had a great time because of the good service and enjoyed the cocktail sex on the beach and long Island ice tea made by Francis. Francis also made my visit to Ce La Vi an enjoyable and memorable one as he was charismatic and friendly with good service. Francis made sure me and my friend were well taken care of which made us feel welcomed and I will definitely be back for more cocktails made by Francis.
5
I was lucky enough to visit this restaurant a couple of times in different trips and have to say both visits were spectacular I had the lunch tasting menu. And a cool beer as it was very warm up there.The food is lovely the service is great and the view is just something else!!
4
We were here for the Awesome Rooftop view for the Beautiful City of Singapore, at Level 57 of Marina Sand Bay Hotel.
The S$ 20.00 entry charge is a Cash Voucher, can later use it for the Food or Beverage.
3
View of one side is great. Had dinner. Spent $350 on 4 apps (terrible) a bottle of wine (great) and two aperitifs (ok). Tried to go take a picture on the city side and told it would be an additional charge. Will never come here again. How cheap do you have to be to ask for more money to take a picture after spending $100s of $$? Have a drink. Don't eat.
5
Atmosphere was great as we went there for dinner. The food was delicious as well; we had scallops, steak, fried mushrooms which were pleasing to our tastebuds

Already our second visit - and again we really enjoyed the food and service combined with a breathtaking view of Singapore by night.

Me and my husband went to Ce La Vi for dinner last night. This is our third time in this restaurant . Firstly our table was very good facing the Gardens by the bay and sea view. Thank you for the good view table to the guest relation. Secondly before the renovation the food was very nice but now the food is nicer. The taste of the all food which we had and the presentation of the each food was very cute and nice. We had as an appetiser squid, vegetable dumpling and boneless chicken wings. Spicy food but addicting we had the second round of the chicken wings. Our main course the snapper, short ribs with celtuce as a side dish was amazingly yummy. Each of the managers came to our table and asked how is everything and if we are enjoying. The staff who took care of our table named (RITA) was very friendly, attentive, smiling all the time and explained us the each food what is inside. Thank you very very much (RITA) for your super service. We highly recommend Ce La Vi food and the amazing service

My husband and I celebrated our 20th anniversary at CÃŠ LA VI restaurant. The food was wonderful and the service impeccable. Situra, our waitress, helped us order the right meal to fit our taste buds. We are glad we trusted her judgment. It was a wonderful evening.

The food is great, the staff are fine, the view is amazing. Based purely on food and staff this place is a little overpriced, but you pay for the view. If you're not able to afford the excessive prices for the food, go for a drink at the rooftop bar, still a pricey cocktail, but the view is worth it
4
This restaurant is a must as the view of the city is spectacular. The menu is good the food tasty and the service is friendly and of a high standard. The desserts are fantastic and delicious. We ordered pre dinner drinks and they were not cold especially the champagne. Overall a great experience which all visitors to Singapore should enjoy
5
Thank you to staff at Ce La Vi for a great lunch. Love the setting as modern, open relaxed dining. The set menu is clever idea for lunch and the food was delicious. Great option for visitors to escape the heat of the day and still witness the fabulous view. Very affordable food and top notch service. Well done.

Mixed review about the place.First point we - we asked one of the lift attendants as we entered in tower 1 where to go and he said go up here in the lift. Wrong it's tower 3 you need to go.Secondly - actually didn't think the drink prices where that dear considering, so that's a plus point.The views up there are an obvious win, but disappointly you cannot sit to the side which would increase the experience 10-fold. You would have to pay to go to the observatory level if you wanted that.Finally, the drinks did take a while to arrive but I think we just got the wrong guy serving us. I had to remind him we ordered 10 minutes ago and then when we paid I had to remind him I'm waiting for my $40 change. Not sure if that's a ploy so people leave their change and a nice tip?Overall, an obvious "you must visit" for the views, but waited experience poor and views could be better maximised for full potential. Didn't eat here but looked good.
5
The food was incredible! Abbas is an excellent host! So happy we chose to go here instead of the other restaurants nearby.
5
It was THE perfect place to start the evening! Amazing sunset view from Marina Bay Sands rooftop! And the different cocktails we ordered were absolutely delicious!! Thanks to the bartender Francis! I would definitely go back there to grab some drinks next time!
4
We went for drinks to Sky bar. It was so worth it. Beer was $16-18, cocktails $24. But if you compare this to the entry ticket of the observation deck (which is basically attached to the bar and so you have he same view) of $20, you're better off to go staring to the bar without wasting your money for super touristy thing
4
You need to pay SG$20 per person for entry that you get back in food/drink redemption. It's hot during the day so make sure you get a shaded seat. Definitely worth a visit. Don't pay for observation and dining. The dining visit gives you the same views.
2
- Great views- Average food (Asian food in Wagamamas is better and isn't served cold..)- Terrible service - Overpriced (obviously as you pay for the view and nothing else) In summary, don't bother going there for food, just go for a drink and see the view. There are so many other great culinary experiences in Singapore that can't be missed!

A business colleague and myself had the pleasure to have a few drinks at Ce La Vi while visiting Singapore. The food choices were nothing short of inspired and the look, the taste and the service cannot be faulted in any way.Wines (by the glass) are very complimentary to the dishes. I started with the green and white asparagus salad with soya poached egg and a glass of Pinot Grigio ...I could have stopped there and been totally satisfied with this outstanding dish. As my main, I selected the lemon and honey roasted chicken breast ... so tasty and beautifully presented on the plate. My colleague ordered ceviche to start and the beef short ribs - which are worth a picture, they are a stunning plate! To be honest, we didn't have high hopes about this meal - thinking it would be more about the venue, the view, etc. We could not have been more wrong. As a bonus, after the meal, the Executive Chef (Joseph Sergentakis) came and sat with us, joined us in a drink and discussed his passion for Asian fusion cuisine. What a wonderful evening - amongst the best meals I've had in Singapore! If you want to experience how a Greek - Italian, US-born chef who has lived in Asia, brings food alive get on an elevator RIGHT NOW and head to Ce La Vie at Marina Bay Sands! While this was perfect for a business dinner, it would be a terrific venue for a romantic dinner or a group event - nice vibe and delicious dishes
5
I'm totally fall in love with Ce Le Vi!! Gorgeous view! Nice and reasonable price for food and drinks! Foods are also nice too. Services are the best. One thing is it could be open till late at night not just 11pm. Take this to one of the top list when you visit Singapore
4
This is one the "touristy" places that you go for the view and pay the price. Food is pretty average and staff are very nice and friendly. I think you can only sit in the front view table for 2 hours. Make sure you make an rsvp and read the terms and condition eg. Min spending, hours etc.
4
It is on the 57th floor. One needs to buy the ticket to the viewing area but that can be adjusted towards the bill. A lovely place to chill with a drink and some small eats. The place can get very crowded and the tables with the view may be taken up/reserved.Avoid weekends. Ideal time for visit will be weekdays around 7pm. The views are breath-taking. The food though pricey makes up for the view
3
Amazing views and I think that's what you go for. Food was pretty average. Well presented but could do at home. Great staff. Bar out the front was good for a quick drink before dinner. Lobster was beautiful and sweet. Drink prices were abit expensive but you get that.
5
Amazing views, delicious food and awesome service. Great value and a great experience. Loved everything about it.
5
It was an amazing experience and the service was excellent by Ara and Maricel. Happiness overload, Thank you!

Sunday, 4th of June is my birthday but my girlfriend has decided to celebrate for me two days early. She booked this restaurant call Ce La Vi which is located at the skyPark of Marina Bay Sands hotel.Actually my girlfriend wanted a table outside which has a great view of Singapore night scenery but as the tables are only for drinks and snack we are arranged to sit inside which is dark and romantic feel.The captain and waitress are very helpful in term of helping out to choose our main course and extra side dishes. Although the food take a while to serve but it is worth to wait as the food taste absolutely delicious. My girlfriend ordered a grill fish which majority of it has been debone. Imagine you are eating a whole fish which has no worry about swallowing a tiny bones. This is really great services.Assistant Manager, Suzette is the most helpful manager I every met. She not only help us to select two great dessert but specially arrange a table outside for us to have our dessert and enjoy the great scenery. I was really touched by her service and lastly she give me a surprise birthday dessert cake which is free of charge. My evening in this restaurant is unforgettable and I strongly recommend to go to this restaurant for special occasion celebration. Price is on the high side but is worth it.This i

The whole eating experience involves more than just the food. Here the food was good but the vista was fantastic. Went for a business lunch and chose the set lunch menu, Curried cauliflower soup with lime oik and braised eggplant in red curry. The soup was crisp and just a little spicy, perfect for a hot day. The eggplant was cooked perfect, not mussy and I could taste it in the curry. Great balance of flavors. The service was efficient but not super friendly
4
I had a pleasure to have a 'dinner for 2' meal at the marina bay sands rooftop.Please make sure you wear a trouser and shoes if you want to have dinner there.I was in shorts, and the staff hand to lend me a pant to wear :-)Food was nice and so were the views.For the skyline view lover's -this is the place in Singapore
3
Unfortunately we dined when there was a function on in the bar of the restaurant so it was very noisey and understaffed.Our meals and drinks took a long time. They forgot our side, brought us the wrong drinks and some waiters doubling up on drink orders, and they let our dessert (with then melted icecream) to sit to the side of our table in view for 5mins while they waited for the right person to right "happy anniversary" and serve it (nice sentiment but would rather it fresh thanks). The service was average generally but very underwhelming considering the restaurants marketing, price and location.The mains and entrees were nice, the chef does a great job and is only let down by the organisation and customer service of the staff. There are other great restaurants in Marina Bay Sands, and surrounds, I would recommend elsewhere
5
Our visitors from Europe wanted to experience once again the atmosphere of dining high up with a wonderful 360 view of Singapore. The restaurant was full and there was a delay in serving the food. The good news was that it meant we could stay for longer than the usual 2 hours slot and they even served a lovely food item on the house as service recovery. The taste and quality of the food was great and we enjoyed it even more than during our last visit. Though the price is obviously something that will make you consider the frequency of your visits, we will definitely come back.All in all a great dining experience with very attentive service
5
A restaurant with a view, the only way to have lunch and view Singapore at the same time. Excellent food and reasonably priced with the entry vouchers we got. Great size portions which really surprised me
5
We had a wonderful time! Great views, fantastic people. Our server, Chris, was absolutely amazing. He definitely made our night! I felt like I was on a set of Sex and the City - Ce La Vie is a great place for drinks and a night out
5
Visited here on our first night in Singapore and was very impressed with the service and the food.We had tuna to start, red snapper for main and a very very rich chocolate dessert.Washed this down with some Ruinart Blanc de Blanc and some Pouilly Fume Service was excellent as well.We then went to the bar after for a G&T (Monkey 47) There was a great buzz at this place and the views over Singapore amazing.We hope to return
5
Awesome view especially in the night. No so expensive compared alcohol in Singapore. Cocktails price 24 SG
4
Me and my boyfriend came here for drinks on 20/05/17, we did go during a busy time at 6:30pm we ordered two mojtios and got served very quickly we loved the drinks. We were then told it would be a while for our change so we went to sit down thinking they would bring it over, after an hour of waiting my boyfriend went to the bar to ask where it was, he was told they couldn't find it! Multiple staff members tried to sort the situation out. However in the end Fizer was very friendly and helpful in solving the problem and offered us a complementary drink which left our experience to be a good one
5
Food is excellent,view is to die for but the staff and the service are the major asset to Ce La Vi.They brought the place to the highest standared ever
2
After paying to enter the rooftop bar, You are greeted by segregation. You may only enter which parts of the roof you have paid to enter.The bar itself was not a relaxed environment, You were pushed to drink as fast as you could. The bill arrived before the drinks. Although the whole area is outside you can only smoke in a certain part
5
We had the 3pm High tea and it was money well spent. The view and the food was a great dining experience
1
Went there to celebrate my wedding anniversary. The staff totally spoilt our evening. They would do well to learn some courtesy. They were least interested in finding us a table and behaved like they owned the restaurant! We then headed up to Sky on 57 in Tower 1 where we had a nice Romantic meal. Should say Justin Quek saved my day :
5
My partner brought me here for our 5th year anniversary. Was pleasantly greeted by the hostess at the ground level, glad we do not have to join the long queue as we have a prior reservation. Decided to go and have a few drinks at the lounge area at the same time to watch the sunset but weather was not on our side. Proceed to the restaurant for dinner. Love the ambiance and energy of the restaurant. Service was impeccable, the food was delicious. Shout out to Restaurant Manager Nabil who made us feel so welcomed, always smiling and never fail to check on our table. Didn't get the name of our female server. She was very attentive and ever ready whenever we need something. Will be back, for sure
5
This is a great night out on a Wednesday for ladies they have great music and a fun VIP area drinks aren't cheap but the vibe makes up for it - during the day and night the views are spectacular of Singapore x
4
Had a lovely relaxing lunch at Ce La Vi. With the rooftop location, you get great views of the City, and also the infinity pool in the hotel. Lunch is expensive, but we enjoyed our Wagyu Burger and Lobster Roll. You have to remember you are really paying for the view. Totally worth it
1
The service and drinks are terrible, for the same view The SkyBar or Spago (both on top of MBS) are far better.
4
Quite pricey but DEFINITELY worth it for the view! Don't forget to claim back your entry fee against food/drink!
5
The view of the city is the best in Town and the food is excelent, and the attention give by Rita made the night perfect, I recomend the place 100%.
5
Wow is all I can say!! Why would you want to pay $23pp to go to the skypark to stand in the sun when you could pay $20pp to go to the bar at Ce La Vi and offset the $20 against food and drinks. Mum and I found a comfy couch and sat up here for hours having a light lunch and a few drinks whilst soaking up the INCREDIBLE views.Staff were friendly and attentive, atmosphere is great and the views are priceless. We came back and did it again at night to watch the sunset and see the city lights bring the city to life. Again, just incredible.Food and drinks were on the expensive side with cocktails being around $25 to $30 but the cost was well and truly offset by the location. 6 stars from me :
4
Called in for a mid afternoon drink just to experience the views and decided to also have some 'snack' food which was OK.Quite pricey at 20 SGD entrance fee, you can claim this back against food or drink but it does cost around 20 dollars per drink, still worth it for the views and atmosphere
5
Went for son's birthday which was also our last night in Singapore so we decided to push the boat out and celebrate in style.We paid our SGD20 to the 57th floor which is redeemed against drinks. We absolutely loved every moment, our cocktails,wonderful views and ambience. We got a table right away and, although we had intended to go to a local restaurant, we were loving it so much we decided to eat at our table which was right on the end with the fabulous views of the gardens and ocean. Simple menu, lobster rolls and Wagu burger two examples and a bottle of French rose completed our evening.Yes, it was very expensive but we had decided to go for it and has a truly memorabilia time. Sometimes you just have to do theses things. Very glad we did
5
Was invited for a friends and family dinner and was certainly not disappointed. The new renovation makes the whole room much more open and airy with distinctive Asian elements. The food by Chef Joey really was very good. Great western dishes with a strong Asian influence. As a starter I had the Hokkaido Scallop and Oyster which set the tone of the meal followed by the steak with some noodles and kimchee which was very good. There was a cod dish wish was very excellent too. The deserts were excellent with attentive service. Highly recommended and will be back soon
4
Came here for our anniversary and must say the view and setting was fantastic. The food, for that price really can do with improvement. We went for the degustation which was more than enough food and paired it with some Japanese sake. All up great night but if they improve the menu then it'll be perfect.
5
Ate in bar last night. Simple burger and beer. Restaurant this evening. Food in restaurant really very good. Foie gras and (very light) dumping starters. Shellfish and cod entrees. Walls removed. Great view. Rain had cleared. Tough to beat the location.A treat.

Having arrived early for cocktails, we were sent to the bar. There was no host to greet us or find us a table. We had to queue at the bar to get a drink and then find our own table, which there were none. The only tables available were in the Club Lounge, all of which were reserved. We found a host to ask them to find us a table, and they explained there were no tables available. They went on to explain that none of the tables were reserved, but we could only sit at them if we committed to spending $150. We explained that we were going to the restaurant and had a reservation (and would spend more than $150), but they said that we had to spend $150 whilst sitting at the table. When we pointed out there was nowhere else to sit, they shrugged their shoulders and these were the rules. So with 6 empty tables in the lounge, we had to stand.Having booked for 5, we were initially seated at a table for 4. We were left standing in the restaurant for more than 5 minutes whilst a solution was found - which was - we can pop a chair on the end of the table, facing a wall - no view. Given that this place sells a view, I was not happy. We had to get really cross with a Manager to get this resolved and get a table large enough for 5, but let me tell you, it took a fight! It was very poor and totally spoiled our evening due to the altercation - not what we expected to experience in a premier location.Regarding the food, by this time they could have served me the best meal and I would not have enjoyed it. The attitude of this place is unbelievable and such a let down. To be honest, the food was just ok - nothing special and expensive. Don't go here for the food alone - you will be disappointed. Not sure you should go for the view either - there are so many people, you are crammed in like sardines and certainly do not get an uninterrupted view.When in Singapore we would not consider this restaurant again. There are lots of other places to each that would welcome our custom and not treat us like we are on a conveyor belt. Such a shame. The only thing this restaurant has going for it is the location. There is no focus on customer service or guests experience
1
Impolite staff, especially considering the price. I would go to Pan Pacific instead. Very expensive, 50 Sdg for two basic beers with only limited view of skyline.
5
It is nice all day, but something special at sunset. A good bar menu with many interesting drinks on offer.
5
A great view of the city, with a nice ambience and drinks! Prices a bit expensive but Singapore in general is an expensive city.
Good to go with friends or on a date!
3
Way over priced drinks and food
Only thing is the view some great photo shots
Ordered a Drink took 10 mins before we got it
5
The best food in Singapore.Very fresh and tasty.Amazing dinning on top of the building was extraordinary.
5
Great life that makes me so happy in this place and all I just want is to be in the world of this place
5
Business meeting and dinner whilst in Singapore.Firstly this place is wow. On the 57 floor of the Marina Sands building for a few drinks, yes it is expensive, but don't go there if that frightens you. The view is unbelievable. We stayed for dinner at the restaurant Ce La Vi.Food was exceptional made even better with the executive chef Joey Sergentakis coming to our table to ensure that we enjoyed his creations. Earlier as each meal was served the waiter painstakingly explained the ingredients and method of cooking.Drinks very expensive Ouch! However that seems to be the universal trend in SingaporeI rate this as a must do in Singapore.Well done
3
As others have mentioned - they'll be a $25 charge per person; which you can redeem against a drink. Drinks are expensive. As a walk-in you can't go to all parts of the platform, some areas are reserved for hotel residents. Great views of the city mind. A good one off experienc
2
Being in Singapore for the first time, I naturally wanted to have a drink at the roof top bar of the Marina Bay Sands during sunset. To get to the 57th floor bar, first one has to pay $25 for access and then pay for overpriced drinks. Most of the upper deck was reserved for hotel guests. The numerous patrons were parked like sardines in a very small area, sitting room was scarce and the service was not all that great. A 360ยบ view of Singapore was not to be had
5
This is one of those spots where you just have to be! The food here is great, (extremely pricey) but the quality of service and the food is excellent. This is also turns into a bar club at night and you can just sit and enjoy drinks after your food
5
We went there with our friends and we enjoyed!
The view was breathtaking,nice music, nice atmosphere.
Staff very friendly we really enjoy it.
I really recommend CE LA VIE when you are in Singapore
4
Great views of Singapore!! The food was very good and the drinks were original and very tasty. The staff is quite snobbish, which didn't help, but the view, food, drinks more than make up for it.
3
Very, very overpriced. Tons of tourists and cameras, etc. Great view, food is good, but it's just a bit much. Spago next door is new and has better flow and energy. You are better off venturing to other areas of Singapore.
5
Fantastic view. Good drinks. Food was not very special, though the attentive and friendly service as well as the atmosphere definitely made up for it.
5
As we booked table in advance, we didnÂ´t have to pay for going up. We had perfect dinner in Ce la vi. We were just two of us but we got very big table with a beautiful view. Of course it is not cheap there but I think it is worth of it. The food is amazing, the presentation is great and the service is on a very high level. I must say be careful with a soup (coconut .....). It was very tasty but there is something what is mega mega spicy. I tried it and I cannot even explain my feelings... in spite of that, food is delicious. We also ordered dessert in the evening and as in our reservation we mentioned that we are going to celebrate our birthdays the waitress brought a cake with a candle & happy birthday chocolate. Small sign but it was very nice. If you are in Singapore then go there and you won't regret. Yes it's expensive but for a one night do it
4
We went up mainly to see the views which were great. Staff were friendly and the cocktails good. We just had nibbles which were great. Much better way of seeing the view from the top of marina bay sands rather than going up the observation deck
5
Don't know why I hadn't been here before. Such a fantastic place. Was there in a large group for a friends farewell (they were leaving Singapore for the US). Had to book a place in advance and we all enjoyed the experience. The views over the Singapore skyline were breathtaking, especially with the night lights. We ordered snacky food that was great. The music was fun. The loos were a bit troublesome to get to, being on the floor below
5
The view from your table is spectacular! I went at night time on my first night in Singapore and it really set the mood for the rest of my holiday. The service was excellent and the food was delicious!
3
Costs $20 Singapore to get to this bar restaurant but this is refundable against drinks or food. Cheapest wine costs $28 including tax so quite expensive. Good views of the Marina Bay Sands infinity pool which looks very cramped and is not to my liking. On a clear day this venue must offer great views of Singapore but unfortunately we had dull and drizzly weather and it does rain a good deal in this tropical climate. I thought the venue a little cheap and tacky and certainly in need of refurbishment which given the cost and the popularity should be affordable on a regular basis. Having been up to the top of MBS, my curiosity is sated and I will not return here
4
The view is fantastic, cocktail drink is variety. The finger food lack variety. Not much innovative. The service is goo
5
We visited here around 11am and the place was quite busy with people taking in the spectacular views. We only paid S$20 which enabled us to have a great table, very relaxing with views over Singapore PLUS the S $20 could be used against drinks. A win win situation!
5
*** IMPORTANT ***CÃ‰ LA VI is undergoing a full restaurant makeover from now to 30 April 2017. Our SkyBar and Club Lounge will remain open as usual and we will be serving our All Day Club Lounge Dining Menu across the entire venue during this period
4
We paid our $20 each to go up to Ce La Vi , which entitles you to $20 beverage credit, most drinks were around $25 so you still had to pay a little extra. However lovely views and a good experience but very windy , and I was glad we were just there for a drink and not for a meal.
5
Food was absolutely amazing and so was the view! Kumar was a great host and made our experience there a memorable one, giving us great advice on menu choices and even noting that it was my father's birthday. Compliments to the chef for the food. Will definitely recommend
5
One of the highest place to have good food in Singapore called Ce La Vi is in Marina Bay Sands.My husband and I were so impressed with Singapore we wanted to have fine dining that special night. While going around Marina Bay Sands we found this restaurant on top of the Skywalk.We were there before it got dark so we were able to watch Singapore become so alive with lights.The menu is varied and food is excellent. It is $$$$$, but worth it. The view from atop is so magnificent - city lights and the bay.The service is wonderful.A place to visit and eat
5
One of the best thing about this restaurant is definitely the View , the view is just "Breathtaking" especially at night. Their dinner menu is great and so are their desserts. Really love their "Popsicle trio Dessert" , simply Fantastic and on point! Their service is outstanding the moment we enter the restaurant, we were serve by a waitress name "Chloe" who was very friendly and kind , she makes us feel very warmth and welcoming. She was very patient with us and was very detail in explaining the dinner menu , thumbs up for that. We ended up trying their Poached Chicken , Soy Mirin Tofu and Essence of Tomato Soup. The Chicken is spot on, really tender and tasty, the rest of the food was pretty good too. Overall a wonderful experience. Will definitely be back again..
5
This bar is on the rooftop of Marina Sands. What a breathtaking place!!!Drinks are a bit on the pricey side but for a place like this..it is worth it!Great place to make new friends while travelling.We love it! We will miss this place!
4
It's a nice bar/lounge atop MBS hotel. The view is what you come here for, good drinks (a little water down on the alcohol for my taste though) , food is okay. Best time to come is at night for the view. *no selfie sticks allowed FYI
5
Really nice restaurant on the top deck of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, with friendly staff, great menus and wonderful views over the city. Not so obvious to find, you exit the elevator and turn left, following a narrow corridor to get to the Hostess desk. Try to get a table on the edge, to admire the scene. Especially nice at night
5
This restaurant is absolutely amazing. We dined for lunch and everything about this place is flawless. The service upon entry is outstanding, the explanation about the menu, and prompt taking of orders. Kumar, our waiter, was fantastic. Our food was the best we have eaten in Singapore. My husband and I ordered the pork spare ribs and crispy calamari and rice. Not a drop left!! Price for the quality of food is great.Toilet facilities were spotless, as was the entire restaurant.Then there is the view, breathtaking to say the least
3
Excellent service, menu exquisite, however music totally out of place and repetitive. When DJ asked to add some variety, he refused point blank. He was more interested in talking to others, rather than adapt to the mode of customers.
5
Great food and rate. Very well prepared food and quantity was more than enough. Price was very reasonable. I will recommend to any one
4
Ce La Vi is the rooftop bar at Marina Bay Sands...Requires you to pay SG$ 20 to get to the top which can be used as a cover charge to buy drinks...Just a heads-up the drinks are on the expensive side so will not recommend this place to people looking for cheap drinks...The ambiance of the place is great...Would suggest you to reach there before the sunset so that you can enjoy the beautiful sunset from the top and then stay in late to mesmerize yourself with the gorgeous night skyline...If you are willing to spend a little more over the drinks then would surely recommend you to go this place to view the picturesque Singapore from uptop!
4
On a recent business trip to Hong Kong a couple of my HK based friends called me and asked me to meet them for a drink at the recently opened rooftop CelaVi bar atop the new California Tower in Lan Kwai Fong. A short walk from Central later I was very pleasantly surprised to join them for sunset drinks at a very cool outdoor bar with well made drinks and a great DJ playing painless music. I was so taken by the ambience that I changed my previous dinner reservation and invited my business associates to join me at the CeLaVi restaurant one floor below the bar. I'm very happy to report that the HK CLV restaurant lives up to he standard set by MBS rooftop CLV venue in Singapore in every way - save the insane Singapore view which is, well virtually impossible to live up to. Should you be a late night diner - CLV has a dance club that rocks, but like most clubs, you better be a late night partier if you want to be in a crowd. 
4
You will see Singapore like never before. At night the views are unique. The settings are modern and trendy. Service is attentive. Food is ok, I wouldn't call it the best culinary experience, bit all together it's worthy it. Liked the pork belly lollipops, the Asian spare ribs and the slow cooked lamb chops. I recommend it. CIA
5
Wonderful unique experience. Loved the view from the 57th floor of the Marina Sands Hotel. Menu was quite extensive. They had 3,4 and 5 course set menus to choose from, I opted for the 4 course, this included starter, soup, main course and dessert. The cost of bottled water was high at $12!!I made the mistake of paying $20 to go up to the observation deck, then going for lunch. If you mention this when paying the $20 then you get that refunded from your meal cost.
1
Food was meh (especially for the price) - the fries tasted like they were from McDonalds. The service was even worse. We had to ask for the bill 5 times and it took 25 minutes to get it. My girlfriend and I are pretty easy people to please but these guys just couldn't get it together
5
We had a great time here with friends - great choice of drinks, hor d'oeuvres. Food was certainly good but not one of the best meals I've had for the price. I think this restaurant is great in terms of overall ambiance. Not to mention the views
2
The food here is below average, service is horrible.Can skip this place. Just go to the bar outside which has equally horrible service but for the view
3
Yes this is an amazing place, the view is so great. We had a table outside but had to move due to this guy smoking a cigar in the bar area. Don't know why they still allow smoking here. Especially cigars. It's outside yes but it's also a place for people to eat. The staff were accommodating and moved us inside. Table did not have the nice view but was ok. Our cocktails were superb. But the food was just average. Tempura shrimp were nothing special, the maki roll was good. Nice presentation. Entrees were below our expectations . The lamb rack was fatty and smothered in a BBQ sauce killing the flavor of the lamb. The steak had no seasoning. No sauce. It was mediocre at best. The only thing that saved this night was the dessert the chocolate fondant cake was one of the best desserts I've had in a long time. If it was not for the dessert this would have been a total waste of money. If you just go for a cocktail or dessert maybe it's worth it but if you order food don't set high hopes for a gourmet meal.

Excellent service lovely Singapore food in a setting you dream about .
Lovely feel about the place which makes one feel very comfortable and wish you could stay longer.

Great restaurant and fantastic service. Thank you Din, Noel and Fredric for your hospitality. Will definitely come back!

Went here for sunset drinks. Nice way to get to the top of the Marina Bay sands. While they dont miss you when it comes to paying the bill, at least the views are amazing and the vibe is great.

After visiting the ArtScience Museum, we walked over to Marina Bay Sands Hotel to get a view of Singapore from the observation deck. Since tickets happened to be sold out, we opted to have lunch at the Ce La Vi where we could get the same Singapore skyline view while enjoying a meal. Ce La Vi has a relaxed ambiance about it. We sat at a lounge set with drinks until a table by the window opened up. Service was excellent and the food well-cooked and tastefully presented. We will be back
4
We were fortunate to have received excellent customer service when we arrived. As we were travelling with 2 small children, the host gave us a table with a view. The table was initally reserved, however the host was gracious enough to let us use it before the other party arrived. Thank you! We throughly enjoyed the drinks with an excellent view .

Views 5*, atmosphere 3*, food 1*Views are staggering of Singapore skiline.Atmosphere depends on the day, loads of tourist, 1st time in Singapore, so everyone just looking around. No real feeling of an organic scene.Food is just rubbish! So if ur aim is to eat with nice views go to the other restaurant at the other end of MBS, same views and food food
2
This is a great venue for the view but there the positives of this experience finished. The food was no better than poor pub food turned out for dumb tourists. The service was nice but either not knowledgeable, not prepared or not happy with what the kitchen turned out. I felt completely mugged/robbed and will never come back to this place. I had raved on about this place for weeks as I transited Auckland/Australia/Dubai so the disappointment is deep.We were previous Singapore residents with previous good experience. We booked on Friday evening and arrived an hour early to get the most from the view although there was some wait to get great positions in the Skybar. We had a glass of (very ordinary) white sauvignon blank that we later appreciated was $28 each. The cheapest bottle of wine was a rough Chenin Blanc from SA was $118 while an ordinary Cloudy Bay from New Zealand was an astonishing $228 (we have lived in NZ and this wine is circa $15). OK money wasn't the focus at all as we knew it would be costly but the value for $ of what followed was unacceptable. We asked about the small plate starter portion size and was advised they were quite small. The rock shrimp tempura turned up and was quite big - a share for 2-3 people. The shrimp was ordinary and tasted frozen. Pork lollipops were ok although also reasonably large. We also had edamame which were fine. For mains we had asked for no Garlic so the Lamb Ribs were eliminated from choice as the marinade contained it (and apparently most of the menu). We had Poached Chicken with a veg dish of Hong Kong Baby Kai Lan. Neither were seasoned and irredeemably bland. The chicken was barely cooked and accompanying potatoes hard. I can forgive the hint of garlic but not the complete lack of love and care in either dish. Both mains were sent back. A manager was apparently informed but chose not to speak to us. The waiter bought a chocolate lava cake desert as a surprise 'make up' although we were not informed until it arrived. My wife ate most of it and it was ok. I didn't eat it as my dietary restrictions didn't allow. It was a shame the gesture wasn't explored with us as it may have gone some way to making up the huge deficit I by now felt given the price. Give this place a miss until they have sorted it out. If you want the view go to the other sky bar for a drink and eat in the many excellent restaurants in the Hotel itself
5
I mistakenly spent the fee to go to the Marina Sands Observation deck where I found out I had to go back down and get in the queue to get to the the Ce La Vi. Since I had my ticket for the deck, I was not charged another fee to go to the restaurant. Once there, the view was great. The couches and lounges facing the guest pool are very nice. We had a pizza from the menu and several draught beers. All was very good and well presented. In good weather, I canâ€™t think of a better place to take in the views of Singapore and enjoy some very nice light dining
5
The view from this vennue is excellent( an outdoors table) the servce staff are outstanding. The recommendations for our six dishers where well and accurately discribed. The food was extremely good, the view excellent and the table service was very pleasent.I highly recommmend the Ce' La Vi ma
5
Had my birthday celebration dinner here and definitely enjoyed the delicious food with great view from the top of the iconic Marina Bay Sands. Ordered the beef which was juicy and tender, very delicious. The dessert platter was amazing. Would recommend this as a place for special dinner occasion
5
The best view of the city is at CE LA VI. We did not have any food, but the drinks were delicious. The "STORM COOLER" was the best drink for me (Vodka, passion fruit, honey,& raw liquorice powder).
5
Treat yourself to a wonderful dining experience
The service was first class from both Ryan and May just like the food served. Catering for all taste and adjusting to suit.
5
Had cocktails and took in the amazing view! Once you have bought your ticket 20 Singapore dollars, you then get a voucher worth 20 Singapore dollars, cocktails are 24, not cheap but a must see!
5
By far, one of the coolest clubs I've been to in the world. With an amazing view, cool atmosphere, and great music. I had an amazing time, and I would absolutely go back again.
4
My wife and I had a special dinner here to celebrate our anniversary while holidaying in Singapore. The food was outstanding, the service and attentiveness of staff was great although drinks a little slow to come out. The views of course are amazing. We were lucky enough to have an outdoor table looking over the ocean, GBTB and City side. The only downside is that sitting out here you are constantly annoyed by people from the bar area jumping the rope and squeezing in to get photos while your are trying to enjoy your romantic meal. Also the fact that the public viewing platform is just below you makes for a less than romantic setting with all these people walking in front of you all night. That said we had an amazing dinner and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The only reason for 4 stars not 5 is the above issues and the prices. It is super expensive but hey your are paying for the views. Thanks for a memorable evening.
5
My partner and I went to the cell via bar for the view and a drink. We were very well looked after by Kumar and other members of the staff. The requisite Singapore Slings were very good (better than Raffles by far!). As far as snack go, we had edamame and chili squid (which was excellent!). Would definitely go back!
5
When you purchase your ticket to come upstairs for a view, you can use your 20 Singapore dollars toward food at Ce' La Vi, and I must say it is amazing! We had a Tiger Beer ( the local stuff) for 16 Singapore Dollars and oyster tempura which was some of the best tempura anything I'd ever eaten for 20 Singapore dollars. So it's not surprising everything on the menu is about 20, but the view alone is worth the money, so I loved it
3
We thought this would be a very special night but, although food was excellent, everything else was just to make money. DJ speakers were very close to us so very noisy, it was chaotically busy, a red rope divided bar from restaurant so pointless having dress code. Not what I would class as 5 star.
3
This is the place to go if you wanna get a picturesque view of the Singapore skyline while dining (or having a drink). Beautiful view (esp if you sit outdoors). Good service and waitress was helpful. But food is not up to par unfortunately. Oysters weren't fresh (you can taste the metal), chicken wasn't tender when it's supposed to be poached. All bottles of wines costs $119 and above - sure we can pay, but it's not a fine selection for the price you pay. Be ready to spend $400 at least on your date
3
to busy for my taste. but worth is you want to have a magical night in Singapore. Calamari with a glass of champagne with an amazing view... what else you are looking for? Stay away from the fat tourist if you are a girl high risk to be treat on an unrespecful way
5
great bar for first drinks, very nice view, excellent food Would absolutely recommend this restaurant.
3
It seems the name change has effected the business more ways than one, I have had better times service and food previous years. Having not been there for a couple of years I was dismays at how things had slipped.
5
Beautiful meal shared with great friends in one of the most scenic restaurants I've been to....view was spectacular. Food, wine and service was exceptional.
5
For our group of 8 visiting Australians, what began as a casual drink at the bar to take in the view of Singapore turned into a really first class evening. The place was busy, but the helpful staff managed to assist with our spontaneous request for a table for dinner. We sat inside to enjoy the wine, the food and service. Some of my guests commented that it was the best food they had enjoyed for a long time. Our waiter was efficient, but also happy and engaging for our party
5
The Ce La Vi restaurant is cited at the bow of this magnificent hotel that is Sky Park. All the staff were helpful and attentive. The food was great and the wine list good but as usual in Singapore, expensive.The main reason for visiting this restaurant has to be the incredible views that you have while eating. Wow, wow, wow
5
Well worth a visit, we were advised to come for an afternoon drink rather than visit the skypark and it was a great choice. This is actually a floor higher than the viewing platform on the same level as the famous pool, you cannot visit the pool or loungers but the terrace overlooks it. Entry includes a voucher for F&B which works out great value compared to the viewing platform and it is a much better environment to sit down and soak up the epic view.A MUST visit for any trip to Singapor
4
My bf took me here with his parents. I was surprised with the place, the view very amazing. But sadly rain came in the middle of our dinner as this is the open restaurant. Food and the dessert was good.
5
We booked from the UK for a birthday dinner for 4 people having been to Ce La Vie before and knowing that it would meet up to the occasion. The reservations team were excellent making sure that I had all the options for a birthday 'surprise'. I don't have anything to add to the previous reviews about the location and ambience, except to say that it's a truly amazing location.The real star however is the food and service - both are exceptional. We had the Valentines set menu with paired wines and could not fault the choice of either. Special mention to Rita and Han who were serving us and did an outstanding job, making sure that the evening went really well. Yes it's expensive, but this is Singapore and in an iconic location
5
Thanks to the service staff team and especially to Guest Service Executive "PJ" I have enjoyed very much an exceptionally pleasant afternoon dining and drinking up there on 57th floor with stunning skyline- and seaviews!P.s.: mind not to miss out the fabulous dessert "Textures of Matcha"
5
Restaurant is at the top of the Marina Bay Sands. We were there for Valentines Evening meal â€“ I booked it well in advance while still in the UK weeks ahead to get the day and time I wanted ( 14th Feb ) Great way to get up to the top of the building for the views without paying for the viewing balcony 1 level below but there is a min cost for the evening meal of $80. and that is easy to achieve but the total bill was too excessive considering the location ! Food was delicious ( Veggies welcome ), dessert was the best part bit , service excellent and given the venue the price we fully recommend the venue. Must see views at night! Visited for Valentines February 201
5
Food was delicious and Rita the waitress was great nice views and awesome food. the ribs were anazing as well as the prowns
5
Our family of four enjoyed a great dinner with an amazing view. The food was great and our waitrice, Rita, made the visit special with her humor and smile. We went there twice that week.
4
Had a perect lunch here, lovely waitresses, great quality of food, and a good selecton of wines. But most come for the view which is indeed excellent. Don't expect to leave for less than 200$ though, even for a simple lunch. Worth the price!
5
The table service at Ce La Vi was amazing, all of the staff members were more than happy to help!The food was outstanding and very much worth it for the price. All of our dishes looked and tasted beautiful! Plus they came out so quickly and we were never waiting long between courses.Drinks were pricey but was to be expected. I was recommended to try the storm cooler cocktail and it was great!Lastly the view is incredible! Would definately recommend this restaurant
5
This restaurant is at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. You have to pay $S40 per person to go to the restaurant but that's credited back when you have a meal or drinks and spend at least that amount (they don't refund any excess). The food and service were outstanding. We chose the set menu 3-course meal. We chose the crispy salmon skin salad (which was outstanding!--we asked our server what it was--the salmon skin was delightful and not at all fishy), the pan fried dory, which was delicious, and the strawberry white chocolate tart, which was not only delicious but beautiful. The portions were fairly small but enough for my husband and me, since we don't eat a lot. The price was quite reasonable for such a high-end restaurant. The beer was more expensive, value-wise, than the food, but everything was excellent. To top it off (no pun intended), the view was outstanding! You feel like you're on top of the world of Singapore
4
I had the pleasure to visit Ce la vie restaurant in Singapore for late dinner with my friend. Because we booked the dinner at 10 pm and we arrived 30 min late, there was no one to welcome us and we had to wait to be accommodated. Even thou we required for a table outside, it was not possible due to the fact we didn't come on time. The stuff was very busy but at one point it was less hectic and we were pleased with the service. We had a big dinner, and the food was great. The waiting and the hustle paid off. The music was also good outside, but because it was very windy we decided to stay in. The view is fabulous and it's more than just a touristic place. I recommend to give it try for dinner or drinks.
4
I visited Ce La Vi for after dinner drinks/cocktails with a group of friends and was very impressed. The waitress was very friendly and took time to explain various drinks and cocktails to our group. The views over Singapore were breathtaking and this alone made the visit worthwhile BUT I was disappointed that we were restricted to one small part of the bar and weren't allowed to walk around the whole area. Expensive but worth it for the experience and when I now look at photos of the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel I can't believe I had drinks atop it!
5
At the top of the Marina Bay Sands. We were looking for lunch and tried another restaurant in the complex that was booked out for a function so we found this one. No bookings accepted, at least at lunchtime so we just turned up as they opened. Great way to get up to the top of the building for the views without paying for the viewing balcony 1 level below! Food was delicious, service excellent and given the venue the price was not excessive. Fully recommend. Must be amazing at night
4
Great to catch up on cocktails after dinner. We went up there for the view and certain sections was blocked off which make it stupid not to be able to see the whole place. To pay for expensive drinks and confined to a small section outdoor where everyone has a table and awkward to stand even in between the tall tables outside. No entry of the whole place. unlike NYC, they might have a small sections for VIP's etc and still able to roam around.
5
It was a very busy place, the hostess tells us 80 singapore dollars per head. Which was a bit strange. The place was amazing the view was great. We had some beautiful dishes squid and ribs and some salty dogs.Beautiful place food awesome service ok ambience amazing
5
This restaurant is on top of the Marina Bay Sands. Outdoor tables have a partial view of the ocean, Marina Bay or the Waterfront Skyline. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The food was excellent!
5
I'd been to the Gardens by the Bay and saw this bar atop the Marina Bay Sands hotel a short walk away so decided to give it a go.Paid $20 for the privilege but that goes towards your final food and/or drinks bill.The view is absolutely amazing and the cocktail was excellent as well (with tax, one cocktail will set you back about $28), I didn't eat up there so can't comment on the food. Definitely one for the to do list when you're in Singapore.
5
decided to spend new years eve at "Ce La Vie". and it did not disappoint, food was incredible, drinks and service were outstanding and the view of the fireworks couldn't be better. just one advice, if you are planning to spend this night there be sure to book with months in advance
4
We booked this for our first night in Singapore on the restaurant's website. They confirmed 24 hours in advance of our arrival and we were taken straight to the lifts when we arrived, no queuing. The view of downtown Singapore was amazing as was the service - and we had a table for two on the edge. Food was standard Asian fare, not as good as we had hoped - and for European visitors the wine prices are stratospheric - but that's Singapore, it's expensive everywhere. That aside, for the experience and the view, the price is worth it
3
We had three days in Singapore and this was one of the things to do it was a last min choice to go here on the first evening we paid our $20 each the girl on the ground floor was so lovely we made our way to the 57 floor for cocktails and boy was it lovely busy but nice we waited along time and the bar tenders were very choosy with who they serve I waited and waited finally a lovely Asian girl served me we had a cosmos and Singapore sling very nice , we then decided to see if we could eat we were offered inside but we wanted to enjoy the atmosphere and view , we deicided to have another drink and I caught the eye of the stocky Asian bar tender who looked at me and then completely ignored me and servers several other people this is when I started to get annoyed Woking in a bar you serve in order clearly this guy had no intensions of serving me and the other bar staff were busy on the other side , at this point my partner had gone to see if anything g had come free to eat outside and luckily it had because I was about to complain . We were seated and the service and food were lovely only spoilt by some bar staff that think they are army Sergeants . A not to the management maybe if you employed 2 more bar staff 1 you wouldn't have cues and pushed bar staff 2 you would take more money 3 the bar tenders wouldn't think they are God choosing who to serve first there is an order at a bar maybe the bar staff need to be told clearly a set of big breasts get you served fist 
5
We reserved the table to get a nice view over Singapore. Unfortunately the evening was very stormy and heavy rain dropped. We had to stay inside and we did not see much from Singapore. But on the other side the dinner was just amazing. We had spinach salad for starter, beef and salmon for the main course and a nice dessert. The restaurant is not cheap but the quality is amazing. The service was also very good. All in all a nice evening. Except of course the weather
5
We had dinner at Ce La Vi during our stay at MBS and overall had a positive experience. We opted to dine outside on the terrace even though it was a bit windy! The views and atmosphere from here were fantastic, with the buzz of the outdoor bar area next-door, and the flow of tourists on the other side checking out the amazing views from the observation deck. The staff were attentive and efficient, and kept checking if we wanted to move inside due to the wind. The food was of a high quality (we particularly loved the Sashimi and the ice-cream desserts) and arrived on the table in good time. My only criticism is that our wine that we ordered by the glass, was bought out already poured, which may be alright for a 'house' wine, but at $24 per glass, I think pouring it at the table is more appropriate. The wine list is expensive, but in line with other higher end Singapore restaurants, and to some extent you are paying for the iconic position
4
My partner and I spent the last night of our holiday here and we was really impressed. The food was great, a wide selection to try. We ordered as we went along which was great, as our wonderful waitress Rita was always on hand to make recommendations and advise us on what we were looking for. She made the experience very special and was very attentive. I would definitely return on my next trip as I only managed to try one desert, the chocolate pudding which is a must! Also worth a try is the black cod!
4
We had a lovely lunch at the top of the Marina Bay Sands. I wanted to see the overall view of the city and enjoy cocktails and a lunch at the same time. All was accomplished with a 20$ ticket to the top which was later deducted from the entire bar and meal bill. What made it even more special was our waitress "SITHRA". She was amazingly attentive and answered all of the questions I asked her about various things to do around Singapore. We are going to Kuala Lumpur in a couple of weeks and she was able to answer my questions about what to do there as well, since she is from Malaysia. If you get a chance to go, please ask for Sithra, you will NOT be disappointed
2
Was awesome place when we came, but we wanted to be in a lounge part instead of that we had to join the restaurant even we were not hungry. Ok well, when it came to pay the bill, suddenly none of our cards worked! We are coming from different countries with my bf so we have different cards. Staff girl kept trying and by that blocked my bfs card. They messed with it around an hour calling some banks and so on, I was standing just by the bar. In the end I had to go to ATM with staff and take money where I had limit so wasn't still enough, and another part I had to pay by card. Terrible. In the end they knew that was their mistake but none even say sorry for that long stupid story. The view is great as all rooftops bars around the world. I loved being there but those kind of situations are always uncomfortable
4
Ambience:
The restaurant has an amazing ambience
Food:
Delicious food with carefully perfected details that were enjoyed
5
The Ce La Vi is situated on the top floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel some fifty floors high over looking Singapore.The views are 380 degrees and absolutely stunning during both day and night. Drinks can be purchased before the restaurant opens and this is the point which can undermine your perception of the Ce La Vi. The service could be improved where bar snacks could be offered. Neither are drinks mats which is slightly concerning as the humidity make the glasses drip which in turn drips onto your clothing. That is the downside but not a deal breaker. The good points are below.Prior to the restaurant opening for business the staff are gathered together for a briefing by the restaurant manager which is something I have never witnessed before. On ordering our Lunar New Year meal we were taken through each course and its relativity to the Chinese New Year. Our waitress for the meal was Carly who was superb in her service and explanation of each course. The quality of service was absolutely fantastic. The food itself could not be faulted in any way. The restaurant was suited more to the evening once it had turned night. The lights complimented the event of dining and the resident DJ played a mixture of Barry White to more recent renditions of current "lounge" music. Overall a fantastic place to visit whilst staying in Singapore. A special mention to Carly. You made our night. Enjoy your next trip to whichever part of the World you choose next. Thank you.

I came here again as some visiting friends wanted to experience the views. It has gone under a transformation in the past year what with the rebrand and new menus. While the views are fantastic, it's sorry to say that day or night it's still a money-grabbing, expensive and pretentious place. Now you even have to pay a 20 dollar visiting fee (redeemable against a 20 dollar glass of beer/other), which means you have to queue just to get to the lift. The staff are still rude and forever hustling, you can't run a tab (or couldn't the other evening) and the whole place is just screams of 'keep buying over priced drinks or get out'. It's a shame as this was still a place that I would occasionally bring work clients to or the visiting tourist, but there's enough alternatives where you can enjoy peaceful views and a drink without feeling ripped off and hustled or have to queue to enter before the evening (just to buy your bar admission voucher). Sadly yet another reason why I have no interest in coming back here. Ever. (If you really want to give MBS your money, try the more relaxed bar in Tower 2 instead)
5
Great ambience. Roof top was great to take pictures. Large menu of choices. We ordered a whole bunch of plates to share and the size portions worked out. Lot of variety. Jeng provided us with lot of options for wines and patiently walked through the menu! Great view! Would recommend as one on top places to eat in Singapore
4
We visited CE LA VI at the top of the Marina Bay Sands in the late afternoon for the purpose of taking in the view of the city at sunset. It was a spectacular view and we got some great photographs of the changing Singaporean skyline from dust to dark. The $20 covercharge per person was converted into a drink, which was very good. The bar tender was personality plus. There are ample taxis to return you to your hotel at Marina Bay. It was a great experience. I would return and this time choose to eat up there also. The kind of place that you should visit at least once. Enjoyed by young and old
2
We had dinner here and were underwhelmed. The prices are high; the service was ordinary; the food was average. A never to be repeated experience. Although there were empty tables at the edge with the view, we were seated in the interior by the shrubs instead. The music was too loud as well. They insist upon $80 spend per person
2
Before taking the elevator you have to pay 20$ each and they give you a voucher to have a drinkWe pay 48$ for 2 margaritas and 28$ for a plate of really good California rolls Be careful they add 15$ of taxes and service !!!!The view isn't the best one on the top of the marina bay sandsThe view is really better at the skyparkAnd even if you pay a lot it's impossible to go to the skypar
5
We treated ourselves to lunch here on the last day of our holidays. What a view from the top. If it was just the view you would give it 5*. We had drinks first at the bar and then went for lunch. Food was very good and again the starters were worth 5*. Main courses were ok but not as good as the starters. Very expensive but you would expect that in such a location. It is worth going to be 57 floors up and to have such a view
5
It was wonderful experience to be there at the top of Marina Bay Sands with exciting and beautiful views of Singapore spread around....we were two families, both had a great time and specially the food and service both were excellent...food was amazing and delicious and also much appreciated the hospitality and care of Ms Sithra and her team mates during our stay there....my daughter Sarah really liked the ambiance. Fully recommended!!

This is a descriotion of our experience in visiting and dining in Ce La Vi in Marina Sand Bay. Around midday yesterday, we went to the desk in tower 3 to make a reservation for dinner yesterday evening. We got the reservation, but were at the same time strickly informed up till 3 times, that a dresscode was used. No sandals, no T-shirts. And we had to bay minimum for 80S$ pr person. We had read that before, and arrived 19.45. Showing our reservation we were allowed to go to the elevator. Lots of people in this but with puffing we got a corner. Could not see the display and left elevator with everybody. On 56. floor. Couldt not find the restaurant. Suddenly somebody took us and another couple and told us to go to 57. floor. Up here we found a desk and showed the reservation. The woman sitting here told us to go inside, and she took the card. We asked her, if we shuldn't have the card with us, but she said: no no it is not necessary. After waiting about 15 min, we stopped a very young girl from the staff, asking for a drink and a table. She wanted our reservationcard. She could not understand my name, and could not accepted that we had left the card in the reception. She gave our drinksorder to the bar, and cirklet around for another 5-10 min. I told here, that this was not OK and then she went to the reception. While we were waiting, we could see a lot of young people in sandals and T-shirts. Then a woman from reception come and showed us a table. Why this story?Just to tell, dont spend your money dining here. Want to see town from the top? Have a drink. Here is no service no logistic and none smiling servants.
4
If you know of a place at the top of a 57 stories building, you just go there because it is worth the visit. View was great and music too.
A lot of people, from all age.
Drinks were a bit expensive.
4
We went for a few drinks, which all went down well. It had a lovely atmosphere in general. The view was really nice (although obviously when you are on top of Marina Bay Sands, you can't see it).
3
Second lunch at this restaurant, but less enjoyable than the first one. Very noisy place.Of course, we come for the view, even if we have a restricted access to a smaller area and not the full plateform (extra fees!). Food is OK, qualities are very small. Honnestly what you will have in your plate is not amazing. Around 200 SGD for 3 people with a glass of wine / bier and 2 or 3 courses menus
5
This restaurant has it all. Good food, excellent service and a view that is out of this world. A must for everyone that visits Singapore.
5
Was a beautiful night with beautiful food only mad better by our waitress who was so helpful and friendly really made the night, her name was Rita and she is a good asset for the restaurant, we have 3 courses which was all very nice! Including black cod and a range of starters to share. It's an expensive restaurant but with service and food and view it's to be expected! Thanks for a great ending to our tri
4
I don't know if this is encouraged by the owners, but we found our way to the penultimate floor of this amazing building, but just had a drink and enjoyed the fantastic view. We would have had a meal but it was between-meal time. The staff member was very welcoming and we really enjoyed the experience, watching the young people in the swimming pool adjacent to the bar.A great spot
5
We had such a wonderful time having dinner with amazing views. The service was great and the food was fabulous
5
Visited twice so far. First time, it was raining so had to sit inside. we ordered the set Menu & the food was delicious Second time, we were able to sit outside.Outside is definitely better provided you get a place with a view. We ordered Ala carte this time since one of our guests was vegetarian, I then realized that not much options for vegetarians here :)Desserts were good
5
Booked the Ce La Vi for lunar new year reunion lunch. Ordered set lunch, cheese and chachuterie platter. Yes, we also had a bottle of wine. Great view and decent modern Asia food. The only thing that needs to improve is the service. Maybe it was too busy and/or a bit short of manpower. We needed to pour the wine for ourselves. Given that there was 10% service charge and the huge margin on the wine (I checked the price online), I would expect a better wine service. Anyway, it is a great place to have a memorable dining

A really good time at the restaurant, with attentive and knowledgable staff led in our case by Mun, who was a great host. The CNY set menu was fabulous, with the particular highlights for us the Crispy Fried Pork Spare Ribs & the Steamed Sea Bass Fillet.Highly recommend

It is located on the top of the famous hotel and it has the best ever view but remember - Singapore has lots of rain in the Afternoon and Evening! Bear in mind, the pool is ONLY for hotel guests.
5
Best view of Singapore , worth to spend sometime there while having some drinks .
Good choice of snacks. Not tried yer for lunch/Dinner.

Food good not amazing but good.. only problem was our table was right next to the smoking area outside

This was my second visit to Ce La Vi (formerly Ku De Ta) on the top-most (57th) floor of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. I decided to take my mother here as the restaurant does provide an amazing view of Singapore. If not for the view though, you have to consider if it's worth the money to be absolutely honest. There is a minimum spend of 80 SGD per adult, which is basically a drink, a small plate and dessert. If you are not after the breathtaking view, then there are many other fantastic dining options in Singapore that will provide better food/beverage value for money.Having said that, the food at Ce La Vi is indeed excellent. There was nothing we selected that I didn't enjoy. The food was served fairly fast and our main waiter was lovely. Other staff were also friendly enough but unnecessarily nonchalant. Might be part of the experience but the place isn't THAT fancy.On this occasion I dined with my mother and two children which was lovely but I think the environment is better suited for couples and friends who want a memorable night out.If you are more interested in the view than fine dining, then I'd look into getting a Skypark ticket which actually gives you a better view from the 56th floor decking. If you can afford the 200+ SGD spend on food and drinks, then it's worth doing at least once while in Singapore. I would certainly go again for that 'on top of the world' feeling, and if I didn't spend all my money shopping

The view will simply make your nips hard! Truly amazing. I really expected it to be windy and cold, but after lunch we sat outside and enjoyed the view. Inside it was very comfortable and nice.The lunch is pre-fixed 5 course. The food was good, but not excellent. Did not really matter because of the view. We ordered a bottle of wine to go with our lunch, gawd it was expensive. For a bottle which would be about 10 to 15 bucks in California, it was $123 SD. Yes....I understand that alcohol is very expensive in Singapore.Overall, you should experience this restaurant, its very unique but in a very nice way. Not over done or over the top, but pretty romantic
5
Gorgeous place and breathtaking view. The bar was bustling during the sunset and we were a group of 10 looking for a place. Tho, the pool area was off limits, the bar area and lounge sitting was just as mesmerising. Most of us had sangrias with finger food such as pizza, quesadillas and of course french fries. We enjoyed the place so much that we went again during the same evening when the crowd was a little less and view was even more properly visible
4
Ce La Vi is located at the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands' Tower 3. Lunch is served until 3:00 pm and last seating is at 2:30 pm. The view of Singapore was awesome and breath-taking. We had the 3-course meal which was priced at around S$35-40 (GST excluded). All 3 meals were done well and staff members were accommodating. We loved their desserts! This is my 2nd time at Ce La Vi (formerly known as Ku De Ta) and we'll still be back on our next Singapore visit
5
Worth making a reservation and having a drink at this restaurant...the view of Singapore is incredible
5
Sat outside and enjoyed a first class dinner. You can sit inside as well but sitting outside was comfortable and enjoyable. The menu was good and the food delicious very well presented. Straight to the bar afterwards and then on to the Club on the same floor with the best views of Singapore. Highly recommend this
4
Paid to visit the roof for views and drinks. As not eating, only allowed to stand. We still loved the experience. Nighttime visit so evening light shows happening below. Drinks expensive but ambience trendy and chilled . dJ playing easy listening, chill out type music. Some pairs of girls hanging around, possibly to pick up business men. Bouncers at the lifts 
4
We went for the view rather than going to the sky park. You have to purchase a $20 drink voucher to enter and you get the same views as the sky park and that amazing pool.
5
Totally worth it and not expensive for view and the vibe. Great cocktails (in fact the best) and snacks. Decent staff . Cool place to hang out on weekends . Super duper view of singapore
4
Great Atmosphere, Great View and Best of all the Set Lunch! Love the settings of meal they serve.. Taste was full of Suprises..
5
One of the must visit places to have a bird's eye view of the Lion city - 360 degree, I mean all corners of Singapore. I prefer the view just when all the lights from the buildings, streets, etc are switched on after the sun sets.. Singapore glitters. Looks more dramatic to me than during the daylight. The food and drinks are scrumptious. I had fresh young coconut water for the sunset drink. My friend had a cocktail. And pizza for all.Above all, it's the view that is magnificent!  Remember to bring your quality camera with you
5
We were a little unsure if going to ce la vie for the views was the right choice but it totally is. You can redeem your 20 dollars back against a drink. I read in another review that drinks were really pricey snd more than 20- they arnt. A beer is 16. You could get a soft drink and skinny fries for 20 dollars also. Just watch out for the 10% service and tax added on to the bill, but it's great to be up there and have a drink. Another plus is that you can see the infinity pool of the hotel (although you cant use it
4
We came for dinner and had the tasting menu. The staff and service were excellent.The food was wonderful and presented immaculately
5
Our second time to Singapore. Our second visit to Ce' La Vi. Dinner last night was absolutely amazing!!!! Beautiful cocktails, amazing starters, fantastic wine. Could not fault the amazing view, outstanding service and mouthwatering food and drinks. The view is unmissable when visiting Singapore even only in town for a night.... Thank you to all staff and particularly Leo Lopez for another amazing experience, can't wait to return to Singapore and Ce' La Vi!!!!

We came to Cé Le Vi for some drinks on a Friday evening. We paid the $20 per person minimum spend and ordered two drinks. We were bought the bill with the drinks, so explained that we would be wanting more drinks once we'd finished these. Our waiter took our two $20 vouchers to "keep them safe". Any hopes of further table service disappeared after this and we were left with other people's half eaten food in front of us. Giving up on being able to order another drink, we went to the bar to order ourselves. When we tried to pay and mentioned our open tab with the vouchers, the barman called my fiance a liar. No questions asked, no investigation done; simply refused to believe us. We asked to speak to the manager, who resolved the situation by hunting down our tab and vouchers. However no apology was offered for how rude the barman had been. This is not the sort of treatment you expect in any establishmention, let alone a premium one. View is nice, but bar staff are rude
4
We like the place! Amazing view! You feel very close to the sky. Food was good but in small quantity and for very high price! ( paying for the view). So if you are very Hungry be ready to spend!
5
We were a party of seven having dinner at Ce La Vi, and we got one of the best tables on the terrace with an amazing view of the city and the harbour. The service was prompt (almost too attentive) and competent. The food was also of best quality and we enjoyed everything. Prices are very high, but the quality of the food and the magnificent view makes it worth the money
5
Fantastic restaurant with amazing view from 57th floor. Food is great. It is a bit expensive but very tasty. It worth a visit.
4
We called to make reservation just 2 hours before, they played like they were so busy. We got there 30 mins early and were seated immediately. Not busy at all, every second table had people dining. The view was amazing and we took lots of great photos. The food was very nice as well although on the expensive side but you are paying for the view! What did not impress us was the service. Very pushy and rushed but also disorganized. Waited 15 mins for 2nd round drinks. They tell you beforehand that each reservation has maximum time of 2 hours at table. We would visit again for sure.

We visited Ce La Vi on recommendation of friends. The restaurant/bar is on the curiously banana shaped building that spans the three towers of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, at the head of Marina Bay. The location gives a perfect view over the city of Singapore, the marina, and the ocean. The hotel infinity pool takes up one end of the terrace and there are bars and cocktail lounges at each end of the publicly accessible parts of the 'banana'. When we visited, mid afternoon, there was a S$20 fee to access this 57th floor that could be used towards food and drink orders at Ce La Vi. This is a reasonable way of limiting the traffic onto this very desirable viewing platform, and we were happy to pay it. We obtained seats on a couch with good views of the city and the infinity pool with little trouble. After our first margarita, a tropical storm came over and we retreated to the bar inside, which played a great selection of music, and served very good light food choices. Given the slight chaos when the tropical storm hit the staff did an admirable job of serving customers and protecting the soft furnishings out in the weather. This is one of the best experiences in Singapore and a great place to spend an hour or so having a drink with the grandest view this beautiful island city state
5
If you are looking for a restaurant with a great view of the city and harbour, the sunset, mix with the in crowd to people watch, and enjoy a great meal, this is the place for you.The food was fantastic. There was a recommended set menu you could select or just go with what you wanted. It is all based on shared plates with small and large selections, followed by dessert.We went a mix from all the different selections. The standouts were the miso cod, the lamb ribs, and for dessert the chocolate fondu, not to be missed.Rita our waitress looked after us all night and made the perfect recommendations for us. She really made the night special.After dinner we stayed in the outdoor bar and then headed to the Club Lounge. Again, this is a must do.We will go back here before heading home
5
The place is extremely nice and on the 57th floor is a must visit if you are visiting the marina bay Sands! There is a cover charge of 20 sing dollars which is adjustable in your bill but the stunning views of the city more than make up for it
2
Drinks were pleasant and we “finally” got a table near the balcony so our views of the Singapore skyline were uninterrupted!Other than that it is not worth going there.I love it for the amazing pictures, “we took ourselves”, of the beautiful skyline.The service in the sky bar is quite slow but the bill comes very quickly!We already have been there five years ago, left with good memories and positive feelings about the tasting menu!Thursday January 5, we visited this place with our two grand daughters whom flown over for the holidays.BUT what a disappointment to dinner in CÉ LA VI restaurantView was poor inside the restaurant; we saw nothing from Singapore!Food was noting special, let me say:It was average but “very pricey” food... we know “a lot of” better and cheaper food on other rooftops in Singapore.We chose 4 time the tasting menu on 168 S$ Per personFor the two of us with wine selection, 128 S$ Per personThe water, and soft drinks we paid separately!10% service Charge 97 S$Taxes 74,69 S$Final payment: 1141,69 S$ for a lot of frustrations!Yet even a tablecloth!Fresh Oyster where really small (each one)Must say: Seared Togarashi Tuna was the best of the menu!Marinated Angel Hair was nothing special and the serving was a disaster, therefor perhaps no tablecloths?When serving Carpaccio there was a fumbling from the waiter to serve this, I felt really in a third rows restaurant!Though it would really help, both for the taste as the eye, if the serving is individual one plate per person!We had all four also The Roasted Black Cod Miso: my husband and one of our granddaughters had the Roasted Black Cod Miso who was way overcooked, we reported directly to the waiter, no reaction came back.The Grilled Lamb Ribs (two small lamb ribs) with only fat and no meat have been decisive!This time reported to the waitress and also reported (again) the overcooked codfish.Finally the manager arrived, we communicated our displeasure to her.We want nothing from our complaint, just that other visitors do not incur the same discouragement.We had an extra dessert and we were offered a glass of red wine.But what turned out, the wine had cork taste.We said nothing more, but do want to lose this comment!We hope this helps some people, for us… not worth the money
5
Superb restaurant beautiful view chilling atmosphere and in case you like Asian Japanese fusion cooking definitely the place to check out when in Singapore Price is a little on the high side but you've got to look at the whole venueWines are great and service is also very good Only drawback I can find is the chairs which have been changed after the make over and the are really not comfortable
4
Service and food are nothing of special and prices are very high. But the place offers an amazing view and for that i recommend to get up at 57th floor and drink a gin tonic (or anything else which is basic because the cocktail also are nothing special...
4
Ce la vi is on 57th floor part of Marina bay sands tower 3 . You have to purchase 20$ each voucher to get into bar which can be redeemed as a drink or food The view is breathtaking and you also get to see infinity pool which is the biggest attraction on marina bay sands . 56 floor is sky park which also requires a ticket , for us that was part of our tour .which we used next day . The drinks at the ce la vi is around 20 to 25$ each cocktails and so on .Good vibe , Ce la vi has three to four options . When you go up there ask specifically to go to area where you can view infinity pool and other side is the sky bar which has a view facing Singapore flyer . For 31st December night they close the viewing of sky park which is on 56 the floor .Also to get to ce la vi on 31 st night the cover charge was up to 400$ and onwards , book months in advance if you want to watch fireworks from there as they get fully booked specially the tables on the sides .normally the New Year's Eve packages are out from end of October beginning November .
5
Spectacular views from 57th floor. Beautiful terrace. Fab food , Afternoon Tea , or for cocktails and/or drinks eclipsed only by dinner! Really fun place to hang! All day menu is terrific.. look for the cheese platter,and stuffed chicken wings. Afternoon tea from noon to 5:00 pm. Nice shaded outdoor seating area and very attentive waitstaff
5
If you are in Singapore--you just cant miss this place-you should not miss it-you will love to see Singapore lit-from over up here-you will never forget the sight from here-enjoy!!
5
The fusion food at CE LA VI is excellent as usual and the service was very pleasant with our waitress Sithra
5
A must do in Singapore. This is the top of the marina bay sands hotel (the boat shaped hotel up high). The views are immense. On evenings men need long trousers and smart clothing. Beer not cheap but not too bad.
5
Perched at the very top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, there are very few bars and restaurants that have such a spectacular position with 360 degree panoramic views. It is one of the 'must do' things for any tourist or visitor to Singapore and an amazing place to enjoy a chilled beer on a hot day. But beware, because of its position it is not cheap, but still well worth a visit
5
My husband and I had the most incredible date night at this restaurant. Our table had a breathtaking view of the city and the ambiance of the restaurant was so romantic. Even though it was busy by the bar with lots of people, we felt like we were in our own nook The food and drinks were amazing - some of the best we have ever had! The service was exceptional! Our servers PJ and Leo made our experience unforgettable. They even brought us the most delicious raspberry chocolate dessert we have ever had! I highly recommend this restaurant. You cannot beat the views, service, and food
5
Went here for dinner, the food was very good (black cod was nice) reminded us a bit of nobu. Good drinks and cocktails the staff were nice a few of them were from Korea and very friendly. Go a bit earlier and have a few drinks at the bar as the view is amazing.Recommend this on
5
Got here at 6 just as the sun was going down. It would be worth coming just from r the views - they really are superb. The infinity pool area looks a bit tacky to me but the food and service were brilliant. Based on sharing plates they really do this very well. A bit to be missed experience.
5
We spent an amazing 2 hours drinking cocktails on this 57th floor rooftop bar at the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore on New Year's Eve. The price of SGD 20 dollars per person (paid when you pick up the ticket at the lobby level of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel) can be redeemed for drinks and food at this premier rooftop bar. It's much better value than just taking the ticket for the viewing gallery on 56th floor of the hotel as the latter charges a few dollars more but there's no seating and no drinks or food
3
Visited this place with some friends and family. We booked this place 3 months in advance and still were only able to get a seating at 21.30 o'clock, which is quite late. They assured us however that kitchen was open until late at night. We ordered our food by 10 pm and when starters were served the waitor told us that the kitchen would now close... they accept late reservations for the evening but rush the guests to get done with their food... this is poor... food was also not verry special, i'd say it was average but pricey food... i've had better and cheaper food on other rooftops in Singapore. Furthermore, The place is packed with people! Not only the restaurant but the lounge and pool everything is filled with people! There are nicer and calmer rooftop terraces in Singapore. This is a tourist attraction and deffenitely overhyped. I give it a 3* rating for the amazing pictures I was able to take of the beautiful skyline. Other than that it is not worth going. I suggest to visit this place only if you dont mind a ton of people. This restaurant would not survive if it wouldnt be for its view and location. It would not survive if it were located on a first floor.Cheers, hope this helps some peopl

I went here with my family and we started with a drink on the rooftop terrace . The view is certainly hard to beat, overlooking Singapore. As a starter I had garlic prawns which had little taste. My girlfriend had sushi which I tried which was excellent. As a main course I had chicken with green curry. The curry paste was very good, however the chicken was mediocre. The service was good but not exceptional which you would expect for the price you pay. Another dissapointing factor was the fact that the kitchen closed at 11 pm which gave an overall hectic atmosphere to our dinner. In a big city like this you would expect the kitchen to be open at least until midnight. Overall the view made the evening very special, the restaurant did not
4
$20 to get up the lift but you receive the same value as a credit off drinks and meals. Food was simple and service fine. It is worth an hour of your time to fill up and see some excellent views of Singapore.
5
Went to this restaurant to celebrate a friends' bday and the food and service were fantastic!! Leo Lopez took great care of us and all the servers were good. The pork ribs, beef carpaccio and wagyu steak were amazing. Definitely recommend this place!
5
However no more so than many other restaurants in Singapore. Food excellent and views are fab. No complaints, would recommend - but go for outside table for best atmosphere ...
5
I have awarded 5 stars on the basis of pure customer service (waiter service). else i would have given it 1 star on the food alone.ambience and view - very nice from the Sky Bar.order two dishes which were tasteless - not worth the money and were just pointless. A chicken panda and tuna tartare. Don't bother ordering - you will be wasting your money.drinks were pleasant enough and we got a table near the balcony so our views of the singapore skyline were uninterruptedwould i recommend this place - yes for the service and drinks (KUMAR was excellent) but not for the food. enjoy 
5
We were advised to share plates, which was a good advice. The service was attentive and we all enjoyed the food and the wine which was really quite good. We were overlooked the sea and gardens on the bay. The views were stunning and I really wanted to take some shots of the financial district downtown, but waited until we finished our meal. That was a mistake as the viewing platform was closed at 10pm, so. Eat earlier or take your pictures before you eat
2
I took my dad who was visiting me in Singapore to experience the bar at CE LA VI on a Sunday afternoon very disappointed by the service! At first I ordered drinks at the bar and ask for a fruit juice and two virgin mojitoThe bartender told me that they don't have fresh fruit juice, only bottled one. How can it be for a bar that is of a high level?Then the barman served the two virgin cocktails and they were pink... I asked 'are these mojitos"? He said no these are virgin Singapore Slings. I said we ordered virgin mojito and he kept on insisting that we ordered sling. After insisting longer, he did new virgin mojito for us.Then I went to ask if we could sit in their upper section of the restaurant and a waiter refused, saying that it was closed for cleaning. I did not see anyone cleaning there, and I found that totally inappropriate especially that my dad is not so young anymore... The waiter could have wanted to help and find a solution but I'll never know, as someone who looked like a manager (a lady) stormed in front of me and started shouting at the waiter in front of me 'dont send anyone to the club lounge it's packed now, stop sending NOW ' I just left in disbelief of the situation. Overall not a special experience, on the contrary..

We only wanted to see the views from Marina Bay Sands yesterday. Since it is the holiday season and everyone in Singapore had the same idea, we thought it best to dine at Ce La Vi at Tower 3 of the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands. What a delightful discovery, the restaurant manager, Mr. Leo was able to accommodate our group of 12 people. Our table was overlooking the Gardens By The Bay, the view was incredible. We had the sunset by the water and incredible lights in the early evening. We were even more delighted when the food came, Ce La Vi has one of the best grilled lamb ribs I have ever tried. The rest of the family had the tempura, sushi, seafood fried rice and other Asian dishes. Suffice it to say that all the plates were clean before we left. Really sumptuous food, our compliments to the chef. Kudos to Levelyn, our very attentive and accommodating server. This is now our go to place when in Singapore. I'm going to make a booking for my next trips in April and June 2017
5
Service amazing, view amazing, food amazing, drinks list AMAZING! Went with 3 girlfriends on a recent trip. Had visited before a few years back when it was called Ku de Ta. I remembered it being amazing and nothing had changed. We had a booth on right on the edge looking out over the Singapore gardens... you can stand near the bar for a city view, but really anywhere you look its beautiful.It is a busy place so bookings are essential i would say. I don't think we had anything of the menu we didnt like! Up there with the best atmosphere & view of any restaurant i have visited in the world. I recommend going at night to view Singapore's gorgeous lights but it would also be nice in the day
3
In order to get in you must get a $20 'admission ticket' which is creditable against your food or drink. This is done to prevent sightseers / backpackers going up for a view and not eating or drinking. The old Ku De Ta was much better and it appears that the new owners changed the name (due to a law suit) and raised the prices. The quality, to be honest was excellent, shrimp tempura, California Rolls, Edamame, salmon rolls and Sashimi Platters were all correct and served properly BUT were in my opinion overpriced. Do it once but caveat empto
5
Was here earlier this month and had a wonderful time. The restaurant is on the 57th floor and the view is without a doubt beautiful. We booked well in advance and were given possibly the best table in the house with unobstructed views. I would recommend booking in advance as it was packed. The menu definitely had something for everyone and the cocktails were all very good. The staff are well trained and very courteous, always a plus! The end result is definitely not budget friendly but I would highly recommend it for the ambience, view, & food. Last but not least the music was excellent and really set the vibe, definitely go here to have a good time.
5
The place with view of complete Singapore from front and with the sea & gardens by the bay from backside of the club is just an amazing experience
5
If you are looking for a nice place with great atmosphere and great view, this is the place that you should be at.. Food is not fantastic though.
5
My wife and I dined at Ce La Vi for Lunch and selected the Chefs tasting menu. The dishes were all thoroughly enjoyed and were well presented on the plate. Some courses where brought out quickly in succession so we had to ask to slow the pace down a little which the wait staff did. The atmosphere, service and views from the restaurant were all fantastic. We finished lunch with a glass of wine admiring the magnificent views from the outdoor Club Lounge area
5
Ce La Vi, Definitely singapore's top resto-bar, top quality food - world's best, every bite is a burst of flavor -friendly staff, very accomodating service, one visit is not enough. I can guarantee that an occasion can be best celebrated here & will be full of memories that you will keep foreve

// this review is for the nightclubWent there on a Wednesday Ladies' Night with my out-of-town sister to show her a good time. Belinda, who was working the VIP line that night, was exceptional. She was friendly, accomodating, and professional. She ensured my sister and I both had a great time and in general did a great job facilitating a very large crowd that night. She and the rest of the staff there deserve major props. I'll be back
5
I see a lot of people complaining about te price, but to be honest..with such view, I won't complain at all. I made my reservation online and request a table for sunset time, facing the Gardens by the Bay. It was breathtaking! The food was great (had salad, sushi, steak and dessert); and we ordered aperol spritz (safe choice). Service was great too..there was a waitress (too bad I forgot her name) and she was helpful and attentive.

This restaurant is part of the Sky Park at the Marina Bay Sands. It costs $20.00 to go to the 57th floor for drop-dead gorgeous views over al of Singapore (who needs to ride on the much-lower Singapore Eye?). The restaurant itself offers outdoor or indoor eating, but on a hot and steamy Singapore day the decision to eat in air-conditioned comfort was easy! We opted for the set-price $38.00 lunch for which we received a delicious cream-of-cauliflower soup, a modestly-sized chicken salad, and a cup of coffee. The beer we chose was a delightful, large, COLD Amstel ($15.00) which gave us blessed relief. Afterward we chose to look around the amazing sights, but you can't approach the edge as that's reserved to the non-eaters who leave at the 56th. floor. The service was friendly, efficient and even, on this pre-Christmas season, unhurried
5
Went for dinner here on our first night in Singapore and we're totally bowled over by the amazing location which afforded a magnificent view of Singapore by night. There was an amazing vibe and energy to the restaurant and the food too was truly outstanding . Highly recommend it to all!
4
Recently had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant... excellent food and magnificent views! Overpriced and expensive, but to be expected... We were having dinner during the first seating (second seating starting at 20:30)... The waiters and hostess should make it less obvious that they want you out asap... (as we were told upon arrival that we need to be out at a specific time). Especially at what they charge per person: a minimum of SG80 per person... If too expensive, go for drinks (same floor) - more affordable, great vibe and also fantastic views
4
Worth it for the view, but the food was average, service was terrible. Dessert tasting plate was the best course of the night. The food is expensive, but because of the view it is easily forgotten. Don't sit inside, some seats have no view at all
4
$8,00 plus 10% service charge for a cup of coffee
Then you can enjoy Panoramic view
of the city .
Compare with $23 entrance fee for observation deck .
Enjoy !

I was there with my friends on last Saturday..food and drinks were average.
Supervisor was lacking in attention.
Our first drinks served promptly but another round lacked in follow up. I was expected more.we enjoyed ambience of MBS.

A trip to Singapore (first timer) would not be complete without a trip up to the top of Marina Bay Sands. Yes, it is true that non-hotel guests do not have access to the infinity pool, because otherwise I would totally be there! However, you can still enjoy the beautiful scenery up top. There is a SG$20 cover charge to go up to the restaurant/bar/lounge, but that SG$20 can be added towards your bill. It really is a lovely place to grab a drink and enjoy the view. I would suggest going at sunset to see the colors change in the sky and on the skyline. The menu seemed very mediocre and basic, so I would go elsewhere for food. They have a lovely cocktail menu, so I just stuck to that :
4
I went to this place as it was highly recommended. And it is true the design, the views and everything is perfect. It is pricey but that is to be expected at such a stunning location. What I did not expect is such horrible service and a lying waiter in a place like that. I paid about $45 for one drink and a few Hors D' Oeuvres. You could pay that before you go up. I ordered white Sangria and then received red Sangria. I tried to tell the waiter and then he told me it is white and that is the way they make it. Really, I bartend part time and I know red wine from white wine but really. If you gave such terrible service in the USA in a top notch place you would be fired. Anyway, I did not make a stink but just enjoyed the view. I hope that this was just one bad waiter. Otherwise the experience was wonderful - the views, the music etc
3
I was back to this restaurant because of the spectacular place and nice dinner we had about one year ago. Again I was impressed by the surrounding and the atmosphere. The food however was clearly disappointing: the foie gars was O.k. But given all the top class rstaurants in Singapore not rally compatible. The Steak prepared as a n Italien style Tagliata was no t good in quality and the whole course was prepared without any intuition. The restaurant should do its best not to become a "tourist trap" would be a real pity. So next time I will come back for lunch

We visited Ce La Vie on our final night in Singapore, really for the views we knew were on offer, but the food and service blew us away. The menu offers some excellent choice, we really struggled to make decisions. Luckily they advise a sharing format for all dishes so we all got to taste a little of everything.On arrival we were presented with drinks & wine list and we made avail of several cocktails and two bottles of excellent Lebanese wine, it's one of our favourites so seeing it on a list is always a winner. Our waitress Jess looked after us so well all evening, she catered for our two dietary requirements extremely well and explained the format to us with ease. What sets the restaurant above is the attentiveness of the staff, Jess paid close attention to every aspect of our meal, water and wine glasses were refilled almost before we realised they were empty. A special shout out goes to the Crispy Baby Squid, some of the best squid we have ever eaten. Overall an absolutely excellent nights dining and we will put Ce La Vie at the top of our list for must visits on our next trip to Singapore

Great experience, the views are amazing of course, the food and wine etc was really nice. A couple of the waitresses would stand awkwardly close and 'supervise' while we ate which did put us off a bit. family of 5, really big bill but its ticked off the bucket list. plenty of much better places to enjoy a meal for MUCH les

Amazing stunning view over the Marina, Harbor and Singapore. Special elevator bringing you there against a normal cover charge. I enjoyed thee drinks and view. Really a must to do in Singapore such as Eiffel Tower in Paris. Really enjoyed, stayed for one hour and could stop watching around. Just remember Singapore is humid
4
The food was good and the drinks list good as well. The service was ok, but that was due to one waiter who was not interested in serving. The views are great, but I would suggest getting a table viewing the bay side as no one can get in your way of the views.

This restaurant has the most awe inspiring view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands. If you imagine the top as a concrete ship (as I do) then Ce La Vi is the bridge right at the front. We were a little disappointed to find their usual tasting menu (still on their website) was not available and we were only offered the Seasonal tasting menu with 2 less small dishes and 1 less large dish for an extra $20 per person - no thanks. So from memory we picked the best dishes from what we remembered. Having said all that, the food was amazing!The Togarashi Tuna was excellent as was the very tasty sticky squid (we ordered another). The black cod miso was possibly the best fish dish I have ever eaten. We will come back to Singapore just for that dish. The sirloin beef was the only disappointment, but we are from Australia and are a little spoiled when it comes to good steak. The seafood fried rice and the Hong Kong baby Kai lan were also excellent. Oh, I almost forgot the wine, the Spanish Cab Sav was fantastic. We had a great night for $300, well worth a look (pun intended)

Food was served lukewarm had to send back. Overall food was OK. The view is amazing but would recommend just going for a drink
5
Food amazing and views spectacular. Would love to go back again. Saves paying visitors fee to the building and able to wine and dine in the process. Could be very romantic with the right company

Trendy place with a great view but given the price, I was disappointed by the food. Didn't complain because it was OK but just expected more...

Today's service was a abysmal. Firstly we had to find our own table. Then after sitting 10 minutes and asking for a menu we were still left waiting. Eventually it became a self service bar by way of find your own table drinks and food menu. After eventually placing an order for two plates for my husband and I it did arrive reasonable quickly however that was only 1 plate another 5 minutes wait for plate 2. We had to ask for water twice and to top it all half way through our food we were presented with our bill. There's a lot to be learned here. Pay attention your customers will disappear very quickly even with a restaurant with a view

I did not have a good experience at this bar. As soon as I walked in, the waitress ran into me and spilled water all over me. Not a nice welcome, but I understand, things happen. Then, I tried ordering a cosmopolitan from another waitress but she did not know what kind of drink it was. Ordered it from a bartender who was decently nice, however, the drink did not taste good, especially for the cost. After I finished the drink, none of the waitresses came up to ask if I wanted another one. Some of the areas at the bar were restricted, and had a gate like in a subway station, not chic.

I completed our booking by mail from the UK, they were superb in accepting our reservation and confirming the day,before. We finished a cruise in Singapore and wanted a meal somewhere special. Well 58 floors up is special although in a fairly empty restaurant our table had no views and was stuck in a corner, disappointed with that but nit the meal which was outstanding. But pricey but this folowed a 20 day holiday with friends

Me and my husband had our wedding anniversary yesterday December 4 at Ce La Vi. The staffs and service was amazing. Every single staff were always greeting us good evening madame and sir welcome to Ce La Vi. We ordered some small plates and main courses. The food was amazing, delicious. Our server name was Lily. She took care of us really well and she was so attentive to our requests. She was always making sure that our table is clean the cutleries and plates were clean too. We enjoyed our anniversary in Ce La Vi. Heartfelt thanks to all the staffs and the management for the beautiful table with perfect view. Highly recommended
1
My wife and I visited the bas and the restaurant. The bar... the service was so very very slow, sorry, sorry sorry the server kept saying but still no improvement. So the next evening we tried the restaurant. The welcome was excellent, the table was great and the staff were excellent. The food...... resulted in food poisoning. So how do I know it was here ? well during the day I was at work and my wife was at the pool and shopping, it is the only place we both eat at and we both were sick, very sick and on our wedding anniversary.!! Three strikes and you are out
5
once you enter the marina bay sands from the main entrance , walk through the lobby and at the third tower you would see a desk on your left and a woman standing who guide you up to the 57th floor where the sky bar is and its free , its a great place to have at least a beer and enjoying the scenery its kind of unique experience that ive ever had but as you know its pricey . you can see the pool but you are not allowed to enter just residents and you can also walk to the other side of the ship and see the gardens and all surroundings from up there so no need to pay 40 dollar to visit the deck to see the same thin

A group of 7 friends visited Ce La Vi for dinner last Sunday. The place is absolutely amazing. The food is fantastic, the view gorgeous, and the service (we were waited on by the attentive yet unobtrusive Ms. Moon) impeccable.The food first. We ordered the tasting menu (without the wine pairing, we saw a few bottles in the menu we really really liked). It is really very well built up. My personal favourite was the beef carpaccio, but different members of the group had different favourites (some thought the miso cod with angel hair pasta was the best, a couple picked the seared tuna with avocado). The desserts were great as well. We had a very pleasant chat with Chef Roy who dropped by for a few minutes.To enjoy the view, please request for a table outside. We were lucky it was a clear day, and the view is truly breathtaking.I have been to Ce La Vi Hongkong and enjoyed it as well, but must say that the view makes me a little bit partial to Ce La Vi Singapore.Will definitely be back

A great selection of Asian fusion food. Excellent view but make sure u bring ur wallet and b a baller for a night
3
I'd give this place 3 out of 5 stars. 1 star for the location/view 1 star for service and the last for ambience! The food however is a bit of a let down, well the mains anyway. Stick with the small bites and cocktails and this place will probably sit at a 4 or 5 star rating for you
4
Food was delicious- service a bit average - the booking system not great and should have included the Observation Level as you had to buy another ticket for this - not worth it as you can see the same vies from the bar area. bar area not great - you have to walk through the smoking area to even get to see the view- more than half the area closers when it rains and then inside they had a DJ that was so loud you couldn't talk - 6pm at night - useless bar service had to rely on waiters getting you drinks- great cocktails thoug
4
We went here for the first time on this trip and very much enjoyed our visit. We had a reservation, but as the table was not ready, waited at the bar with a bottle of bubbly. The views are spectacular in any direction and definitely the best in Singapore. Our super nice hostess also enabled us to enjoy the views on the "club"-side of the bar/restaurant where one can enjoy the best views of the pool and the city.Service was outstanding, the food was very good and we will for sure be back. This is a must-visit place to enjoy a night out in Singapore, either for a drink and the views or dinner

At recommendation of a friend I visited CE LA VI on a Saturday evening last weekend.Surprisingly throughout our visit from 8.30-11pm the restaurant was running at around half the capacity, which was strange at first for my LONDON eyes, which are used to packed places...We had a couple of cocktails in the outside bar, first, which offers views over the marina, but annoyingly only restricted ones the better views are reserved for hotel guests only, which is bit funny when you are about to drop $200-250 per person on you drinks and food.Since is was very humid outside we went inside where climate was better, but it was so dark I could hardly see anything. It's quite telling that menu and bill all come with a little light attached...We didn't want to kill too many brain cells on selecting our food so went for a 5 course tasting menu for $168 per person, expecting some of the signature dishes.Course started to come and I must say I had to go back to the restaurant's website to refresh my memory as to what we are after only 4 days, which tells you that there was simply nothing remarkable in the offering.We had a tomato soup, which was ok, but smelled as worn socks, we had he Mizo marinated black cod, which is one of my favourites, but to my disappointment it was lacking both texture and flavour and the lamb chops, which was at best average.Overall we we paid $225 per person adding a Diet Coke and a battle of sparkling water, which is a lot for what it was...Overall not worth the money, there are much better places in the city to dine out, such as Artemis Grill, Shinji, etc.This place wants to be like Sexy Fish in London, but lacks the kitchen and the ambience and can match it with only in price, which is not a great achievement since Sexy Fish was voted the most overpriced restaurant in London

We booked for a very special occasion. We arrived a little early expecting to have a relaxing drink before our booking. We were jammed into a crowded lift to the top floor. We asked to have a drink before our booking and were ushered out to a deck jam packed with back packers, the local party crowd and everyone else, barely able to move. The bar tender took and kept our credit card until we left.When finally we were seated at our table the staff were attentive, but that did not help the setting or the food. There was no table cloth and our utensils and arms stuck to the table. We both ordered the same entre and were bought one serve which was three small cubes of pork. When we queried this were told that the serve was the same for one or two! Tasty but tiny.The mains were large enough, but the fish was inedible and left on the plate.The wait staff asked about this dish and called the supervisor across. She was understanding while trying to work in a high pressure environment. She offered adjustments in the bill, which was appreciated.The toilets are down two flights of very dark and steep stairs.We were pleased to get out of the place. We had travelled from Australia to celebrate our occasion in what was described as a spectacular restaurant. I am sure that there are many top restaurants in Singapore, but this is not one of them in our opinion
4
At this location you expect nothing else than perfect quality. We had choosen this bar to enjoy the Singapore Sling with an amazing view.It was a bit disappointing that this cocktail was not even average quality.After complaining at the waiter I was told that the glass is now to empty to expect a new one - this was the second disappointment in service.In the elevator downwards we met some people that made the same experience
5
Ok, the drinks and the beverages, as well the prices were not....let's say...proper. But, I fully recommend it just for the view and the location. Unbelievable experience!
4
Wow, the atmosphere and views from Ce La Vi were great. However the food was not up to the same standard. There was not a lot wrong with the food, it just did not live up to the venue with a wow factor
5
As far as restaurants / bar's go this should be listed more as a must see attraction!Let's start with ...its on the rooftop!I can't comment so much on the food as their menu is extremely limited to meat and dairy selections. As a vegan I was 100% out of luck, unless I favored french fries - which I don't. Aside from the lack of vegetarian/vegan food items everything was great. And to be honest, the excitement of this restaurant is not the food it's the view - it's truly AMAZING !!!It's a major tourist attraction because it showcases an amazing view of all Singapore. I mean you can see everything and it's truly the best view on the island. The restaurant is inside but they also have a full bar, tables and seating outside as well. There is a club on the other side of the roof but it's separate from the restaurant / bar. (The bar is a part of the restaurant and has the same name CE LA VI). Typically their is a DJ playing live music which really sets the mood as well. There is even a sectioned area of the room reserved for guests of the hotel with a skyline view of the city but don't worry there is so much more view for everyone else than there. There is a charge to get up there (for the bad - around $18 -$20 US) but the drinks are reasonably priced. Again, I can't comment on the food but trust me you won't go here for the food anyway - it's just a bonus

We had cocktails and lunch and chilled after a busy morning walking around Marina Bay. The cocktails were lovely and the bar menu was good
3
The quintessential stop for the tourist for that panoramic view of Singapore's cityscape. The view of the infinity pool is interesting as most people are taking selfies. Food was so-so. View & ambience was more memorable than the food
4
This is a must go place in Singapore at sunset. It is outside, so a bit warm, though they try to use fans to help. You have a view of the infinity pool and the incredible skyline from 57th floor. Plan on having difficulty getting seating so you may need to stand at tone of their standup tables. They reserve the best seats at sunset for their "members" but most will allow you to get a photo or two. I had a fantastic drink, and lousy pizza. They bring you spicy chips when ordering a drink. My bill for 2 drinks and a pizza including the $20 to get up to Ce la vie, was $88SG
4
Arguably the most stunning views of Singapore city skyline and harbor atop Marina Bay Sands, both day and night. Cuisine is Asian fusion, with Western influence, delicately and cleverly blended to thrill and excite. The service staff are confident and attentive, though our waiter was a little weak on product knowledge. Prices are fair, considering the quality, service and environment. Easily one of the top choices for best places to eat in Singapore
4
Ce La Vi offered good food and a beautiful view with excellent service. The price was almost USD$300 for two without any alcohol. Ouch. It was a special occasion and we knew the prices but all the upper floor restaurants at Marina Bay Sands are exorbitantly priced. We were staying at MBS so I doubt we would go with anything like this again. It was great fun and a nice memory
2
We were really disappointed by the quality of service and food. The view and drinks were great however we had to ask every time we wanted a drink, we waited a long time for drinks menus, our tables weren't cleared of dirty plates until we asked and our main meals came out cold. We told the staff our meals were cold, they re-made the meals however still came out cold again. Beef was also rather tough.Overall really disappounting especially when paying those prices. I would at expect much better service
4
Best view in town for those who haven't seen. As it looks towards the city, it is quite spectacular at night. Once you get over the views, the DJ is particularly good at spinning the right grooves to get you in the mood for partying. Drinks are not cheap but it is special. Food is only so so to be honest you would not go there to have dinner even though you can
1
Certainly the place to be seen, however dont expect service, nice food or being treated as a guest. My daughter is a vegan,we asked numerous times for confirmation on menu ingredients, this was all fine, first course arrived with mayo on the top, next course had dried fish sprinkled over the top, dessert had ice cream. Minimum charge for dinner, over price
4
This is a good place to see SG from the top of Marina Bay Sands. Cool experience to be at the top without having to pay just for the observation deck. Order the prefixed menu. The food is nice. Make a reservation and sit outside by the edge so you can enjoy the view
4
I have been to the one in Hongkong prior to this one. The one thing this place scores over the HK outlet is the fabulous view. Primarily due to the height of the building and unrestricted view of Singapore down below.The view here is to kill for. Rest all is just about ok. You will come here only for one thing...and trust me, you will really love the view in evening. Rest is overpriced, and average at best.
5
Difficult to get in at first (big fuzz about the 80 SGD minimum spend required); once that was overcome, came back 2 times. Good food.
4
Visited with the minister of finance after a bottle of fizz. The view is great, lights of the ships were coming on. We were told we'd have to leave by 7.45, which we were ok with as our visit was impromptu. We took the small plate option, with pork ribs, stuffed chicken wings, sticky baby squid, tempura vegetables and orange fennel salad (cold). The MoD Loved the squid, I loved the ribs and chicken wings. The fennel salad was excellent with the orange cutting through. A bottle of Ruinart to set things off and a good night had by all. Thing to remember is that the prices don't include the service charge or tax so don't be surprised. Price wise not for the faint hearted but good for something special.

We were staying for 3 nights at the Marina Bay sands and decided to try the hotel's various restaurants, since we heard the place fills up we made a reservation well in advance and in person, asked to be seated outside for 7:30pm. When we got there we reminded the woman at the counter about our request to be seated outside and were told yes tables are available then the hostess who initially took our reservation came up to check which table we were being given pointed to something on the sheet and reminded us about the 80 SGD minimum spend required (that was the second time we were being reminded!) we were escorted not to the area depicted in the pictures but to aside area in the corner, with me facing a bright green exit sign next to a new born baby, we were obviously tucked away in the corner for some unknown reason, My boss a senior gentleman oblivious to restaurant politics was content to sit wherever but I as not, being a world famous architect giving a key note on architecture at a conference at the hotel's conference centre I thought he deserved a better table, being a guest at the hotel at that!Well I contacted the waitress asked to be seated at another table even pointed to the section we wished to be seated in and was informed that the section was "member only" ????!! and that other tables were full (in the two minutes between seating us and being asked to change???) I insisted that we wait at the bar till one became available and was told that we could be seated inside...I was about to kick up fuss, but my boss said inside would be fine...so I relented and we sat inside. Luckily our server was a lovely cheerful girl the only saving grace that evening! though we were once again reminded about the 80 SGD minimum spend *eye roll* The drinks were decent the tempura a tad oily, the sushi was good except bits of that same tempura were chopped up and put atop the spicy tuna sushi rolls hence was over kill (our fault we should've read the menu better thy provide light for that sole purpose too), we couldn't eat anymore as our appetite was killed by the ridiculous seating fuss! so we moved to dessert but nothing to salvage the evening. The next evening we dined at Spago and that was a 5* dining experience with warm service and outstanding food.
3
It's a great view but the food is average and probably over priced for what it is. Had the sticky baby squid and stuffed chicken to start, with a massaman beef stew and roast chicken in kaffir lime and green chilli sauce, with a mushroom side. The mains were better than the starters but small portions for a curry and rice dish. The bottle of chianti was good but we needed to ask them to decant and air the bottle - they don't do it unless you ask. Very polite and good service - just wish the food was better.
4
This us a good way to see Singapore, the $20 cover charge is refundable against food and drink so it's a free view over the city. The food is good but quite expensive as are the drinks, but with such a great view it's worth paying for
5
I have eaten here twice for special occasions - both times we sat outside overlooking the city and it was fabulous! The staff is excellent and the food is very good - though you do pay for the view! You have to request to sit outside as most tables are indoors.
4
celebrated my birthday at this venue. There are two sittings for dinner, so you need to be there promptly at your booked time, so that you are not rushed, which you don't want to happen, as it is expensive. The views to the city are fantastic. we booked for 6.30pm, the food was good, and a nice touch to have my name written on the desert, with the happy Birthday wish. Thank you Ce la vi. Bottles of wine and champagne start at about $300 a bottle, including. taxes. A steak, $98 plus 17% tax. On a nice night it would be nice to have a city side table outside, where there is a covered bar, and music.. As mentioned, if not raining I would prefer outside.I think the plus for this venue is really the view, and that is what you pay for
4
This was a fantastic place for a special evening in Singapore. We went for a few cocktails beforehand, which were great, in the lovely bar terrace. The DJ music was perfect and not too loud, and it was a great way to see the Singapore skyline.For dinner, the staff kindly worked to execute our request of a table outside.1 downside - the view is spoilt by all the people who pay 20SGD to see the view (rather than eat or drink), which blocks the view for diners. This didn't ruin our overall experience, but was a little disappointing.
4
Staff are very attentive and efficient....views are great if you can get an outside table but atmosphere is spoiled by restaurant being right next to the bar making it feel crowded. Even paying $25 for a glass of wine does not get you the best view which is reserved for hotel guests only. Food very nice. My recommendation is just have a drink in the bar and order bar snacks.
1
I had the worst bar experience of my life at the c'est la vie bar. The main reason were:1. the concergie staff was extremely rude,  accused me and my girlfriend to have arrived at the wrong time - it was not true - and dismissed us with a very annoyed face when we complained. Our problem was that we couldn't access to the cool part of the lounge as I was wearing shorts, that was OK, but as I was not informed before when I payed, I was disappointed. I think that the employee was thinking that we wanted just to get the free view, but assumption should not be made in customer service, and we were very offended. Never had such a worst customer experience.  On the good side one if the employee on the top floor was much nicer,  explaining with a smile why she couldn't help, but this not enough to cancel the previous terrible experience. 2. I acknowledge that a top roof bar can be much more expensive than average,  but when you pay 45 dollars for a cocktail and a bottle of water you expect at least that the service is up to the standards.  In the cheapest pubs of small towns were barmen where schoolboys that were still learning how to make cocktails, service was much faster (we spent 30 minutes before our cocktail arrived). Either the bar was understaffed or the barmen inefficient.3. The cocktail was desgusting.  Maybe I was just unlucky in the choice,  but it really tasted like eau de toilette (it was the geisha cocktail, strongly not adviced).However, it was the worst experience of my life and I really hope that they will start attaching more attention to the customers or they will have many similar reviews

Hi the atmosphere is nice, good food, and the Service was awesome. I recommend the brownie with ice cream really good one, and sashimi salad.
5
Superb view...superb dj..must visit....although ure not allowed at the infinity pool side...but totally outstanding.
5
It' s located in the fameous Marine Bay Sand Hotel at the top. Before there were Ku De Ta now it has changed. Need reservation and be chik. The view and the atmosphere is fantastic and also very noisy. It' s expensive but if you have a chance try it. Instead of visiting observation desk try here.It has a soecial reception down on the lobby beside the entrance (but not the main one) and with a special lift you take to go up.After midnight it turns to a night club, so try not to be in the mid tables or in some time you have to move or leave.I recommend;SalmonSpicy Sashimi Salad,Prawn tempura,Udon noodles,Chocolate FondanAverage,California roll,Tuna roll,Yellowf in Tun
4
We our overseas relative up CLV for a pre dinner drink. We paid sgd20 per pax for the ticket yo travel up to the bar. We used the ticket fee to pay for our drinks. We were impress with to drinks, foods, the ambience and off course the view. Highly recommende
5
The staff at the restaurant were very friendly and nothing was too much to ask for. Especially from the manager Leo Lopez not only did he give a personally recommendation of what dishes were most popular but he ensured that every aspect of my evening was to be enjoyed for my birthday celebrations, from sending out a complimentary desert with a personal happy birthday wish and also assisting us with VIP access to the club after. The food too was incredible. I would highly recommend the black Cod. Thanks again for everything Leo. Ma
4
Whenever I visit Ce La Vie, regardless of whether it is with 2 people or 10, Leo Lopez has never failed to accommodate us. He is perpetually friendly and is extremely kind and generous, providing the best service and experience for myself and my guests. Thank you Leo for your continual effort to provide the best Ce La Vie experience
4
A place absolutely worth visiting. You pay to enter, but this amount is then taken off your bill when it comes to pay. We went just drinks, and they were expensive, but it was worth it to be able to look at the incredible view. Staff were great and very attentive. My only slight criticism, and the only reason for not awarding 5 stars, is that the seating furniture was a little tatty. The cushions weren't particularly clean and were ripped in some places. I would imagine this is probably just due to frequent use, but when you pay such a price for your drinks, the little details like that make a difference in my opinion
5
There are a direct lift up to the restaurant, you will get great service upon reaching. The meal is expensive but for the view it is worth it and get to dine in one of the finest places for dinner in Singapore. After dinner you can proceed to the bar for some drinks and enjoy the night views
5
If you're wanting drinks at a rooftop bar, then Ce La Vi certainly meets that criteria. The views are spectacular which you never get sick of. The atmosphere at the bar is always buzzing. A great way to spend the afternoon and long into the night
5
Myself and my boyfriends experience was spectacular! The food was pricey however well worth it and the views were breath taking. We would like to thank the Assitant Manager Leon from Ce La Vi who greeted us with kindness and made our experience one to never forget! Himself and the staff's service was fantastic and I would highly reccomend all to visit this beautiful restraunt as you feel on top of the world! This is a MUST when visiting singapore ! Thank you again Leon lots of love Sofia and Aaron xx

Situated on the top floor of the Marina Bay Sands.
Great atmosphere n amazing food! Service was impeccable!
Lovely, lovely place to dine at! :))
Highly recommend!
5
You can see all of Singapore in here! The city view and the night view were magnificent! Also the drinks are delightful, and the staff were friendly!
5
This is life... Enjoy a relaxing lunch up here and a nice view from this 57th floor.
If you enjoy a place to drink and away from the crowds, go to the bar.
Recommend this to everybody who enjoy life....

Pretentious, underwhelming and so disappointing. The food was terrible- high prices does not mean high quality for this place. Even with the incredible view it couldn't lift this restaurant from under the clouds. Don't bother
5
CE LA VI is an absolute gem of Singapore. Yes, the views of Marina Bay are spectacular, but what really makes this place special is the wonderful staff -- the CE LA VI team makes their guests feel like royalty. On every visit I have been welcomed with open arms. In particular, I would like to thank Leo for his kindness. The ambience, the food, and the cocktails are wonderful, but it is the people which really set this popular spot apart. The staff members make a concerted effort to welcome guests and make one feel as though CE LA VI is home away from home. I am truly fortunate to have found this spectacular spot, and truly grateful to the people at CE LA VI who have made this my go-to haven in Singapore
3
Beautiful view and great service. Was told there was a minimum spend of $80 each to dine there. After spending what we thought was $80 each we asked for the bill which then included a service charge and tax charge... :-/ so meal was a lot more expensive than first thought ...be warned .. Was sitting outside which turned into smoking people's second hand smoke near by.. Can't fault the view and service.. My meal was average however others in the group enjoyed there's.
5
Relatively Expensive $200 per head including 3/4 drinks per person. But worth it for a special occasion.Service - as good as I have had for a long time (Jess was excellent). That's from someone who eats out most nights.Food - Japanese based and really good quality.Views of Singapore Marina Bay/Gardens by the Bay area were fantastic. I will return.Only downside is that we were not allowed to step on to the deck to make the best use of the views. Disappointing when we were a big party and spent a reasonable amount of money. Maybe you can look into this
4
Situated on the 55th floor of the Marina Bay Sands and open to the public the bar sits adjacent to the iconic Marina bay sands infinity pool on the 55th floor of the hotel In particular many thanks to CJ and Josephine who looked after us so well on both visits.We visited the bar twice on the way to and back from Australia.The view is amazing, the staff friendly and helpful and the service excellent.A must do in Singapore!
5
Folks, going to eat at the Marina Bay tower is just what you have to do when visiting Singapore. The views and location are truly amazing especially during the sunset hours. Plan about 2 hours, and get a dining table outside with West facing views. You will need time to see the sunset , and then the sparkling night lights of the city. We had a drink at the bar then sat down for dinner around 1830. Plan 30 minutes at the bar to look around at the amazing view. Every staff member was truly exceptional! Now for the food. It's OK. But really, who is going to a place like this to eat amazing food? The only thing besides the view to blow you away is the bill. It's very expensive.
4
Our last night in Singapore so we wanted something special and it lived up to expectations. Wonderful views - we went for a number of starters rather than main courses which provided more taste options. To top it off when leaving we heard live Bowie playing in the adjoining bar and it was Paul Roberts from the stranglers with his band on tour. Enjoyed a couple more cocktails on the dance floor - what a great night
5
Drinks too expensive, weather too hot, but well worth it! The view here is hands down the best in Singapore. Come before sunset to get a good spot.
4
Nice views, good food and service but you are definitely paying a steep premium for all this. Would I go back? Probably not.
5
Ce La Vi was great at the sunday brunch. breathtaking views of the skyline and ocean. The outdoor is weather permitting. Nice wine list and cocktail menu too.
5
We visiting Ce La Vi for an afternoon cocktail. The view was spectacular and everyone who visits Singapore MUST visit this restaurant. Our only criticism was that the service was not as good as at other venue in the city.
4
For a restaurant that is so obviously aimed at large numbers of well heeled tourists the food is surprisingly good. A bit expensive (cheapest Johny Walker starts at gold label) but as the restaurant was bought not too long ago for 100 million S$ you understand why the prices are as they are. Great food, great service, amazing view. As mentioned the food is very good but not amazing, so keep it at 4 stars
3
The view from the restaurant is stunning. Unfortunately, we arrived early and were shown through to the Sky Bar to wait for a table, which was very busy, but fun. After a drink, they kindly showed us to our table early as we were feeling tired. The service was good, quick, friendly and efficient. But the food was average. We had pork spare ribs which were lovely. However, the Massaman stew was nice, but fairly ordinary and the lamb cutlets my husband had were fatty and below average. We had a nice time, but not top rate.

We went for dinner here last night. Overall a pleasant enough experience. The service we found to be very good. We had a nice french man who was very attentive. Our meals were lovely. Started with crispy sticky baby calamari. Then mains we had the strip loin steak and slow cooked salmon. The best salmon I've had. If you like salmon, get this dish. It is an expensive establishment as others have mentioned (but we knew that going in) My only annoyance was we got sat next to a table of extremely loud tipsy woman. Made hearing my partner & waiter hard at times. Nothing really can be done about that. Overall as a treat it was good.

Went here for a drink and a snack on the side before heading back to the airport. Both were very disappointing. Never knew one could mess up a simple apple juice and a portion of fries. Not something one would expect at a price of 21Singaporean Dollars. It's not the money but the quality of food and drink that I got for it. The juice tasted like some chemically diluted drink and the fries were cold and too salty. When I was there, there was no staff around to discuss my order. So I just left it

The views from the restaurant were breathtaking, delivering Singapore at its very best, especially at night. The infinity pool was also worth seeing. Although the food was very good, the portions were small and very expensive. Some of the staff were also a little begrudging of pleasantries which left you with the 'ubiquitous tourist honeypot' feeling. Worth a look, but hold on to your wallet!
5
We went to see the skypark but landed somehow at the CE LA VI which has it's direct elevator from the hotel lobby.You pay 20 sd per person which is refunded when paying for your drinks or dinner.We wanted to sit for a drink viewing the fantastic scenery from the top floor and told we would need to pop a bottle of champagne....it was a well spent deal!Recommended around the sunset - it's spectacular
5
We just went for a drink at Ce La Vie, and just loved the view of Singapore from this place. It is costly, however definitely a must whilst in Singapore!
5
Not a cheap dining experience but well worth it. Make sure you book to get a good seat. There aren't many bad ones. The food is spectacular and the staff are exceptionally accommodating. Would go again in a heartbeat.

It is a location for relaxing and have a special atmosphere of the Bay the food us regular but the location is great
1
disapointing food for outrageous prices. im not a fussy eater. the food taste and quality was so mediocre and disapointing. i cant tell the difference with food crt dishes. fine dining?? if the food reflected the prices i would say money well spent. such big let down. the only thing good is the view
3
It was all about celebrating a special birthday. We went for dinner and the views from our well placed table were excellent. The service was not great having to wait 30 minutes for drink service. When we queried this we received an argumentative response. Given the restricted time at the table this was not a good start. The food was good, but not exceptional and given the prices ($98.00 for beef and $270.00 for a bottle of wine) the dining experience was a little disappointing. When wanting to take photos outside we were not allowed onto the viewing platform despite having just spent $1200.00 on our meal. If you intend to visit I would suggest visiting at night for the city lights and a drink at the Bar would be enough
2
Extremely disappointed. We only had one day in Singapore, I have figured, as we don't have much time, might as well go for the MUST's... Well, this one was way too far from what we have expected. We went there for lunch, hoping to have a nice meal while enjoying the view everyone seems to be raving about. 1 - the food was mediocre, we had a shrimp soup (which was not bad) and tomato soup (which made me think of a canned one) as the entry, sashimis (it is raw fish... how wrong could you go with it, as long as it's fresh) and chicken in coconut milk (completely tasteless, weirdly enough served with half-cooked potatoes) as the main dish... 2 - the view.... at the balcony. We were placed at "the lovely table by the window" which gave 0 view over the city... Distant, yes, but far from what we have expected. After we have finished our meal and paid the bill of almost 150â‚¬ (2 soups, 2 dishes and 2 aperols), we figured, we would take a walk outside, hoping to have a look at the city... Well, bummer again as to enter the view area we were told to go to the level basement to get a ticket and then come back.... And I would not mind doing so, if it would have been clearly stated somewhere that the restaurant does not give you the access to the panoramic are... All in all, considering the value for money, the lack of flavor and the passive-aggressive attitude of some members of the staff I would say it's a huge pass for me. Only advise I could give, go for the bar part and just skip the restaurant. Even better if it is at night time as during the day the view is really not that impressive
5
I had requested a table with a view when booking and they delivered. Our own secluded area with an exceptional view out to sea. Food was very good, not your traditional 3 courses as they bring dishes out at different times (we were advised of this), Service was excellent and well worth the $$ for the experienc
5
We went on our honeymoon and ee loved the food but specially the views. Try asking for a table in the terrace so you can see the skyline in the whole dinner. We ate the lobster and some sushi rolls. Better go oj a sunny day because if not the terrace will not be open. You cant see the pool from the restaurant.
3
Actually this is only a review of the bar, as my friend & I didn't eat at the restaurant. The view is a knock-out on a clear evening. But the service is slow and the drinks are a bit on the expensive side. The music was loud techno the night we were there, but somehow it fit the lights and the mood
3
I went here with extended family and whilst the views are wonderful, the food was expensive and not great value. If you want a nice view and dont care about the food as such this is a great place to visit. There is a club as well and its easy to knock back a few drawing in the beautiful crowd and atmosphere
4
Went there and got impressed by the beauty of the place, the view of the city, its ambiance and the magic of the place. Recommended
5
I celebrated my birthday here and it was the perfect choice. Sithra our waitress gave the most amazing service and the food was divine. The complimentary surprise dessert platter really made my day. Thankyou for a beautiful birthday! :)
5
This is the great Restaurant, the view is awesome, the food is also delicious, supported with the best serviced. Unforgettable memories.
4
Loved the food. Bit slow with the drinks - 45 minutes for a beer.. champagne $45 a glass or $210 a bottleService with a smile. Desert came with a chocolate message which was a great touch.The 6.30- 8-30 time slot worth way over a thousand dollars for 5 people( excluding the champers) produced time anxiety.. they certain like the two evening seating - although in there defence, they nudged gently to move along., A bit pricey so won't be hurrying back - but did enjoy the meal, the champagne and the view.
3
On arrival, the outside area surrounding the Ce La Vi restaurant was bustling due to the bar area but fortunately the inside seating area was a little more tranquil.The menu catered for all tastes and the quality of the food here was good but the lighting was so poor that you could hardly see what was on your plate.I am all for soft lighting but this was ridiculous.Having finished my main course there was some spilled rice on the tablecloth; OK it was my fault but that happens.After the waiter had removed the plates I thought that in a restaurant of this supposed quality that the waiters would then have cleared it up; but no. I had to ask a supervisor to get the mess cleared.Disappointingly the service was quite poor overall as if the waiters were either on some kind of training course or just had no interest in their job. They certainly did not seem to show much initiative.I think as the restaurant is situated on the 57th floor, it is living off its reputation for a view as much as for its dining merits

Celave is the bar come club located on the roof of MBS at Tower 3. Your admission price is refundable against your drinks. You are sped to the top by elevator and turn left to the club and right to the bar.Tried to get into the Club but it was so congested it wasn't possible to reach the bar comfortably so we went to the Bar at the tip of the rooftop. Plenty of tables with no one sitting on, but the waiters are very keen to put reserved markers on then. Purchased my drink and somewhat fed up with their authoritative approach I just took a seat at a table. Along came the enforcer to chase me away and make me stand to drink my drink. I told him I was an old man and I will drink my drink quickly and disappear (never to return again). That worked and I was able to sit at the table for ten minutes. Who wants to stand for a few hours holding their glasses ? Not me!The view is great. The staff very negative. Would not return here again. In fact I only lasted 15 minutes because I wanted to use my drink coupon. If you want a bar with a view of Marina Bay with friendlier staff try the Lighthouse Bar at the Fullerton Hotel opposite

Need I say more about the view? It's absolutely gorgeous and one of the few alfresco venues in Singapore with such unrivaled view. Don't miss the chance to take your best shot at taking a photograph with the beautiful city skyline. I was there for a business event and we were served tapas like prawn tempura and pizza, the food was surprising delicious (I don't usually expect much from tapas served by the servers going around the crowd, as they tend to get cold by the time I get my hands on them but not this time).
4
The thing you're paying for at Ce La Vi is the view. The food is definitely above average, everything was beautifully presented, service was slow but we weren't in a rush so that was fine, it meant we could enjoy the spectacular outlook even longer. Ask for a table nearer the edge rather than by the central building and you're good to g

It was a great evening for my Friend and I to have such nice gathering. With such magnificent views in Ce La Vi restaurant, windy evening and it was just perfect to have a glass of Storm cooler. It was great to try their "Ce La Vi Tasting menu". Thank you Jaquelyn, Ara and Helios for recommending us such nice food and drinks as well as their exceptional services throughout the night.
5
Went here for a wedding anniversary dinner and it was really superb. We had a pre-dinner drink at the bar which has great views and then had a really lovely and romantic dinner. The food was excellent and the service was great as well. The food is an Asian fusion type and was all great quality and great tasting. It is definitely not cheap but for a special occasion it was absolutely the right choice and would recommend it to others
5
Love the spectacular view overlooking Marina Bay of Singapore from level
57. Food was great and service was also tip top.
5
Great way to see Singapore. We enjoyed a set lunch and kitchen was able to accommodate some dietary requirements. Delicious food, great drinks menu and drinks. Wonderful bar to also enjoy here. Highly recommend for food and view.
3
The first time I went to top level of Marina Sands I had the most amazing experience, wine, cocktails and food.
This time I was super disappointed with Ce La Vi. The food was not great and the dinner was super expensive
5
went up to the top for a drink and the view....wow....the view is amazing.
friendly service,had 2 drinks and some nibbles sg65 dollars....pricey but worth the view.

I was impressed by the excellent service received from one of the restaurant staffs Jess, she was extremely warm and welcoming, attentive from beginning till we left. Would definitely return.
5
Came here for dinner in the evening.Firstly, the views are impeccable. If you want to see Singapore in its full glory, this is a fantastic setting for it - on the 57th floor of the Marina Sands Hotel.Service is great. Staff are very attentive but a little slow to come to the table with the bill at the end of the evening.However, food is luxurious! There is a good choice of Asian fusion to choose from whether you what sharer plates or your own plates.Dessert is remarkable. I recommend the chocolate fondant! Beautiful !!
5
If anyone is planning a trip to Singapore, a meal at the Marina Bay Sands is a must.Our experience of dining at Ce La Vi turned out to be very special. The choice of the set lunch menu, whilst limited, was delicious. The attention of the waitress Jess was outstanding. She made us feel most welcome. Her warm and outgoing personality endeared her to us and we enjoyed her company. After the meal she also enabled us to enjoy the view from the terrace. Little extras like this make us want to come back.Thank you Jess
3
The view is absolutely fantastic. She is more of a drinking spot rather than a place to have an exciting meal. Food was really quite average as i presume their main focus is still the beverages. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the cool music and the company of some old and new friends. Not a place that i will visit regularly and please be mindful that drinks are not exactly cheap. The ambience is what gives the place "allure
4
I had a work event here with one of the set menus. The food was outstanding and the view is great. A nice place to bring someone for a quick look at Singapore. Nice for a cocktail in the bar at the end as well. The one draw back is the poor and very slow service.
4
This is one the 'the places to be seen' in Singapore. The location is without equal and the music and drinks are excellent. It's very highbrow and that's fine if that's what you want.The views are to die for and as the last smoker on earth, you can have a biggie outside.It's less of a restaurant and more of a club bar for dancing and socialising. My Centurion card gets me a poolside table which normally has a cover in the thousands so I appreciate that.I've been coming her since it was called Ku de Ta so I suspect some trademark infringement on the name caused a renaming.The cocktails are absolutely excellent but if you want a seat, be ready to pay, or have a Centurion card
5
We brought our first time visitors to Ce La Vie on a Friday night. Once you come out of the elevator you are simply blown away by the beautiful view. Even though it is a bit "touristy" the restaurant itself is holding a very high standard when it comes to food and service. We enjoyed every single dish, and the presentation and flavours were absolutely world class. Combined with beautiful view it is the perfect place to bring visitors. Expensive, yes, but for the whole experience, I would say for Singapore, not too bad.
2
When you get to the sands they have desk offering a promotion for 34SIN$ per person including first drink and a free buffet. First after service and tax It comes to over 40SIN$. When you get to the roof there is a 5Mx5M area allocated for the suckers who fell for the promotion, without a chair to sit on, just high tables. The drink selection is very limited and the buffet are a nice variety of finger food , not all on the same level but certainly ok. Since there's no place to sit pretty quickly we left, making room for the next suckers to enter. If we would have known that there is the sky park option (which too isn't cheap, but a bit less ) we would certainly have chosn ace La V

This is my second time going to Ce La Vi and it certainly does not disappoint. The cocktails are very well prepared and a reasonable price for the location at around $24. The bar was not crowded, most likely because we went on a Sunday night and the atmosphere was very pleasant. The music was good and the bar food was delicious. Definitely get the California rolls! The views from the bar are one of a kind, spanning all the way from CBD - boatquay/clarke quay - to the sea and the ships. This is a definite must for any 1st timer to Singapore.
1
Arrived and asked if we wanted to drink first at the bar....great idea, no wrong bad idea as we stood at the counter, found our own drink list, decided on what to drink and then....we waited and waited and tried to get the bartenders attention for service, silly idea. The cashier was laughing and chatting to another staff member.....the bar tenders just ignored you totally. 10 minutes later back to the restaurant, frustrated. "Oh you are back already". Your service at the bar is terrible and I told one of you staff on the way here.....never mind surely the dinner will be great.....well not so fast. We had a table on the deck, with a great view. Ordered a bottle of wine which was warm and needed to be chilled. Main course vegetables were all cold when served. During dinner it started to drizzle and as you would expect the waiter to come and ask if you would like to move. Don't be silly of course not. We wiggled our chairs and pulled the table till we got partially out of the rain......As we are easy going and never like to make a fuss I called for the bill. Correct of course, not so fast, we had been overcharged by S$123.00, which was eventually taken off.Ok so lets go to the Sky bar for a drink before going home, nice and busy, but with the worst DJ out. I know a few things about music having a daughter who is a house music producer......It was a tragedy, but hey maybe bad timing. Anyway lets order a drink. Two Patron silver tequila for a cool S$ 55.00. A total rip off, but hey this is Ce La Vi. I can stomach the price, but don't short pour the glass. I took a picture just so you don't think that I am making this all up.I don't want management to write me an apology as so many TripAdvisor venues do justifying why they charge so much and why the service was so slow, or why the staff cant move you when it rains......I would rather you take this feedback and reflect of the damage you do when your staff let you down. I cant help feeling how much money you leave on the table because of this. I personally will never go back and the ripple effect of my comments may stop some business coming....I hope the readers of this review will make up there own minds. Maybe it was just an off night. I hope so
3
The food is average compared to the other restaurants of the hotel. The service is very slow and unprofessional. It is pricy and not worthed for what you get. I think this is an independent entity then the Sands Hotel as it is not listed in the hotel room booklet. Not recomended. In stead try Flight or Spago, same magnificent view but better service and foo
5
Visiting this restaurant is a must when you are in Singapore city...Actually it is anytime a better choice than taking a ticket to Marina Sands Skypark observation deck, which most travellers do. Observation deck does not offer you any sitting place, but here you can sit, relax & enjoy the excellent ambience & amazing views of Singpore...almost at same cost
4
I had dinner with some colleagues at the Ce La Vi restaurant.The place itself is great, of course, and offers a breathtaking view of Singapore and the Marina area.Getting off the elevator, you get a bit lost but the huge amount of people around, and it is not so easy to find your way around.After a drink on the terrace, we finally got a table outside for dinner.The food is good but not "ohhh", and I must say that the wine list was a bit disappointing.But the view is definitely worth going there 
3
The place is over hyped. Yes the view is really good from the top . But that the only good thing about this places. This PLC has very average seating areas . can be much better in ambience . The wine selection is pretty elaborate . overall I would say you could easily pass this place and visit other places if you want to really interested in lounges 
4
The view was spectacular. We went half an hour before sunset. Later there was a lightening storm above a distant building which was amazing. Our baby squid appetizer and deconstructed pina colada dessert were the stand out dishes for us. The atmosphere was quite surreal. We were in a roped off area with loads of staff. The nearby bar was busy. Happy atmosphere with a live DJ
3
The views are stunning. Go for the views. The food and service is certainly good. The staff is sincerely helpful. For the price, one could expect a higher standard of food and service. However, it is a unique location. So, go for the views and selfies - not a 5 star dining experience. Adjust your expectations downward on dining and certainly upwards for a sunset setting
4
Offered breathtaking views of Singapore by night. The food was just ok but the views were amazing. Make sure when you reserve, request a table outside.
5
Had an excellent time. Food was delicious and flavorsome, the service by waitress Rita was prompt, friendly and pleasant. The whole experience was very enjoyable and in good atmosphere.
4
It was that time of the year that me and my wife celebrated some alone time away from the kids and this place provided the perfect atmosphere for a romantic getaway.
4
The view is the special attraction. Drinks are nice. The sunset is spectacular and makes the place a must visit. You can hang out even on weekdays after work.
5
Another pleasant dinner for us at Ce La Vi last night. Good food, great view and excellent service, special thanks to Jen for always being on top of our requests, she's helpful and swift as always, made arrangement for us even she's off duty, amazing dedication and customer service from this lady
5
Got a chance to attend a conference gathering at MBS, and evening at ce la vi was part of the same. It was great to be there, right from thrilling 57 floor high speed lift. The deck splits into left and right side from entrance, for a complete 360 deg view of city would highly suggest visit to both sides of the deck if you have permission for. It was exhilarating to watch all key attractions from atop. Information about the main attractions with direction to watch is inscribed around the glass decks. Overall, a great experience to be there
5
We had a lovely evening with a beautiful diner. The fusion cooking was fantastic. I cannot decide which course was the best. The baby squid, vegetable tempura, scallops, carpaccio, lemongrass chicken or the wicked chocolate fondant. All was delicious. And as usual in Singapore a very good service. An ideal place for a nice evenin
4
There is a $20 entrance fee to go to the bar, but it is a voucher, so you can use that towards your bill. It is well worth it. The view is nice, especially at night. Recommended because you cannot go to Singapore and not go to a rooftop bar to get a great view of the city
4
As a special birthday treat we had a magnificent evening on the top of Marina Bay Sands. Such a fabulous hotel, fabulous location and fabulous view of the Bay precinct. The food is Modern Asian with dishes to share, rather than individual serves and service is excellent. It is expensive but you book knowing that. It was a wonderful experience to remember forever
5
As we were staying at the hotel, we decided to go up to the roof and dine at Ce La Vi, located on the 55th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Pre booking is essential, and booking a table for 10:15pm at 9pm the same day didn't seem too much of a problem, although best not to take that chance. The views were fantastic and the lively atmosphere of the bar with music set the scene very well. The food was delicious, and we choose our dishes from the A La Carte menu. For starter we had the Pan Seared Foie Gras, very tasty indeed. My main was the Angus Beef Striploin with chorizo potatoes, goma spinach, anchovy butter. I asked for medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. My wife went for the Roasted Black Cod Miso with baby bok choy, soy sesame capellini, which was equally delicious. All in all it was a great last night of our honeymoon
5
Great place on 57rh floor with the most amazing views we only ordered 2 x beers and the cost was $47!!!!
But it was lovely sitting there on the comfy sofas taking in the breathtaking views
5
Hang with the ultra cool kids! Watch him out for the hookups and life is good in this great club. Best pizza I have ever had even at 4am! Wicked food awesome night view of the city!
4
The food at the restaurant was well-prepared and service was great. Had lunch with friends. It has a comfortable setting and fantastic view. Will definitely recommend.
5
Had a lovely sharing meal of sushi, tempura shrimp, rice, grilled prawns and veg. Food was all so good and service prompt. We had booked an outside table but unfortunately it rained so we sat in for the first time which as still very nice.
4
Under the Ce La Vie Management, the service is still impeccable, professional service staff. The ambience is fantastic with full glass panel, one side overlooking the sea.The food was somewhat great, but previously was much better especially the set lunch. Noticed that ingredients in the starter were not as premium as previously visited last year. Not sure if the restaurant is now using more local vegetable, if so, the premium cost of lunch may not be value for money. Basically you are just paying for the frills of having great ambience and service. Please DO NOT order Thai dessert - Sticky rice with mango. The sticky rice was uncooked properly. The mango was too sour. Just stick to petit four as part of the set menu. I think they are not specialized to replicate the famous Thai dessert.In the previous visit, more premium ingredients were offered in the set lunch, more interesting selection like certain type of chili pepper which you do not usually find elsewhere, or type of rare mushroom you find in the other restaurant
5
This one of the best experience I ever had in a really nice bar. The view is stunning, music great. Is an incredible bar with really good stuff. U don't get charged to be up the top floor. U can see the best pool in the world from the bar.
5
I was recently visiting Singapore for Business.I went to Ce La Vi with my customers. I had an outstanding time. The location is breathtaking and the service is excellent. At Ce La Vi we were greeted by Michelle, an American living in Singapore, she took care of us really well and was service oriented.Wine selection was good.I truly recommend this place to any local and/or tourist visiting Singapore
5
The location is beyond reproach, you are on top of the world with the best views of the city. The food is excellent, probably the best sashimi I have ever had. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food as it could gave been average and still been packed out every night because of its location. Go on, live the highlife, you wont be disappointed.
5
Place was cosy, excellent view, food was excellent too ( one of the best restaurant food I had ), serviced by "Yul". Service was good. The place was a little noisy as there are many patrons. Not suitable for quiet dates. Minimum must be $80/pax for dinner
5
Food was delicious and the view spectacular. You can eat as well somewere else for less money but you pay of course the view with it.They put the dishes in the middle of the table so you can share everything.Oysters, shrimp tempura, sashimi selection, honey glazed pork spare ribs, grilled lamb ribs, roasted black cod and last but not least 1 tasting dessert platter for 2.A nice cocktail, a good bottle of chianti nipozzano, coffee for 2 persons 700S$.Not cheap but well worth it for once in your life!Everything was delicious. For a few hours you imagine yourself king of the world :-
4
We went up with kids for a drink to enjoy the view. The drinks and apple juice were pricey but staff was very helpful and friendly. Was worth the experience!
4
For sure get up here when in Singapore! But be warned it'll be rammed. And the best of the view isnt accessible to you unless you're staying in the hotel.
Food is ok... didnt think anything to write home about. Service great.
5
Had a super experience , mega food ,view and service from Rita and colleagues . Top job many thanks Derek.
5
we went to ce la vi as a business group for evening drinks. the ambience of the bar is amazing and provides some of the most breathtaking views of singapore.drinks are very costly and burn a hole in the pocket but worth a visit to spend quality time. best to go in the evening. if you are a tourist, no need to visit singapore flyer if you plan to visit this place
5
We all know that Singapore eating is not cheap. Expect to pay well at this establishment. This was our second visit. It all starts with your welcome at the entrance, which is on the 57th level. Professionals greet you and you are handed over to your Hostess for the evening. This time it was Jess and she advised us very well on the selection of foods. She attended to our every wish and was present in the background but showed up at exactly the right times to replenish our glasses. A most personable lady and we all felt very special. The view covers the majority of the city of Singapore and it finished off our evening beautifully
4
We went here on a double date and had a very nice meal (although a bit windy). Not the greatest having people taking photos of you eating as they are trying to get the views to the sides of the platform!A good option to come up for a drink instead of paying of the observation level because you are one floor higher - ha
4
Went there for a B-Day dinner with wife and two other couples, venue is very posh with views to die for (57 floor, Marina Bay Sands) service was good but some of the staff could be more knowledgeable and experienced. Food was good but not great, drinks were very slow :) even that restaurant was not too busy at the time. Desert was amazing (Ce la Vi Chocolate Fondue) Overall 8 out of 10. definitely worth visiting
4
Had a lovely Birthday dinner here. Views were just lovely, although would have been nice to go onto the viewing deck. Had to spend a minimum $80 per person. Which is quite easy in Singapore as it is very expensive. Cheapest beer was $16, Singapore Slings $20. Would recommend this for a special occasion food was very nice
4
If you come here expecting a good deal you'll be disappointed. The food is very good with exceptional service however you are paying a premium for the hotel and obviously the view it comes with. 2 course meal with glass of wine will set you back minimum of Â£80 pending on exchange rates. View would be better if they allowed you onto viewing dec
5
I intended to go for just a drink and watch the sunset at Ce La Vi, but I decided to stay for dinner. The manager is very professional and although all the tables were booked, it was a Saturday night, she let me sit at a table as long as I left when the guests arrived. They were very late, so I had the table to myself, to enjoy a drink, some brilliant food, a stunning view and great music
4
A must go for a cocktail while enjoying the views! ... although the indoor tables don't have the best view. Much better to sit outside if you can stand the heat (there are umbrellas for shade). Also fun to peak over at the pool area.
5
We have just few drinks there to enjoy the view, but we have like it very much, service was nice and cocktails very tasty, try Green Garden
5
Went for dinner last night to watch the F1 and couldn't fault it! The food was amazing, the views were excellent and most of all the staff were extremely friendly and attentive! Best restaurant experience so far in Singapore.
4
57th floor...buy a cocktail for Sin $25 and enjoy the view. Staff is efficient. Seating is limited
And the full size tables are reserved for hotel guests..
5
Sithra is a wonderful waitress, she is not hovering but always seemed to know when we were ready for more water, wine, the next course etc. Her recommendations were spot on and she made the dining experience more than just a good meal.
5
We came to Singapore for Formula 1 race and made a reservation at this rooftop restaurant for a racetrack view table.Unfortunately there was some misunderstanding in the reservation and after flying 12.000 kms we had to find out, that the reserved table wasn't with a view to the racetrack. As we were claiming to the restaurant manager she understood our disappointment especially as we had invited a business friend from Singapore.But this lady managed the situation absolutely professional and arranged a table without direct view to the racetrack but you could here the race and follow up on TV. After dinner she invited us to Ce La Vie Club Lounge where the view was much more exciting than from the 3 tables with racetrackview in the restaurant. This was an amazing evening !The food was very delicious but the red wine was to warm. But the waiter fixed this problem with an icebucket.Than also the redwine was tasting very good. Dinner and wine have been at a price standard worth this restaurant
5
Ate here with my travelling partner after a swim in the pool and it was very memorable. The staff are good at kicking out people there without a table, and there was one obnoxious fat goatee dude in his early 40s trying to impress a woman much too young for him near our table. Only way he could be more obnoxious is if he had a fedora. Anyway, the staff asked him to move on, so that was good. Food is great too
4
If you want to reach the top of Manila Bay Sands to view the entire city, one option is to go to the Sands SkyPark, the observation deck at the 56th floor. As far as your eyes can see, the view is magnificent. However, this does not give you access to the infinity pool and the gardens. This will set you back S$20.Another option is to visit the Skybar on the 57th floor, order drinks (eg bottle of beer for S$16) and enjoy the stunning view of Singapore atop one of the tallest structures. This option is probably the more value-for-money alternative. The night we were there, the bar was full. It was lucky for us to get a cocktail table. But soon after we got settled, it wasn't difficult to start enjoying the panoramic view. Truly breathtaking. Plus lively music to soothe your tired mind and body.Caution:This place is not recommend to those with fear of heights.

We arrived early for pre-meal cocktails, and the espresso martini was pretty good. However we had problems with the card machine. Both my Credit and Debit card's were being declined, and that happened no where else in Singapore, or in Indonesia afterwards on my travels. First I rang the bank who told me there was no problem (I have private banking and had already told them of my travels). I then had to get back to the ground floor, cross the bay underneath on a pass to the fullerton where the nearest cash machine was. A huge inconvenience but one perhaps not their fault, although worth noting. The bar was nice with amazing views, however you couldn't help feel a lack of intimacy with so many tourists who weren't out for dinner or drinks, literally 6 feet below you on the viewing deck, which tainted the atmosphere. We sat inside. The meal was beautiful, although a little expensive. The views make the place worth it but I would probably recommend only for a cocktail or two

We went for a drink at night . It was busy and there was nowhere to sit . The drinks were expensive and the cocktails were nothing special. Please note the bar staff were using a half bottle of tonic then leaving the rest at the side to be used for another customer. No atmosphere. Glad we didn't eat there as very dark and the staff provided torches to read the menu 
5
We went there randomly without reservation , we were lucky that they had an available table. There is a minimum spending of 80singapore dollars per person. The prices are ok and the food is just delicious. The view is breathtaking.

Great lunch with great views. Thanks to our waitress Rita, who was excellent and very friendly. The miso cod was very good, so was the spicy tuna rolls.

The location of this restaurant is what draws people to the top of tower three in the marina bay sands hotel. We booked a table and were allocated one with a view of the bay and gardens. Amazing! Food was very good though difficult to see as was so dark. Menus have lights attached, lighting is very low. The menu is described as modern chinese. It was busy and bustling. Hotel guests can walk around the viewing area and have a barrier to pass through. Restaurant users cannot access the gallery but views are still spectacular from the restaurant. Prices are reasonable but remember they add the tax and service which can expand it. There is a minimum spend to keep away the one cup of coffee brigade. All in all a fabulous experience. We had a great meal until a storm suddenly blew in with winds strong enough to blow over the glasses so choose wisely when you go

Really enjoyed lunch at this restaurant. We sat outside (wasn't too hot) and had great views of the city. The food was good (a bit expensive for what it was) and the staff was friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for some good food with a nice view on Marina Bay Sands.
5
We went for lunch for 4. The table was outside, at the barrier with a spectacular view of the marina and flyer and others. The service was friendly and helpful to explain the menu when required. When the food was served each of us was pleased with the amount and taste of each of the dishes. Although the price is expensive, we all expected it to be more when we considered the location.

Used to live in Singapore for more than 9 years, at that time Ku de ta was the place, and it was amazing, the atmosphere was great! But now this new place looks like a normal balcony with lousy music. Moreover, the prices are scary, for a beer i had to pay $28

We have eaten here may times already and we keep going back. If you have vistors coming to Singapore you just have to take them there. The people are very friendly, the food is insanely good, fantastic wines, brilliant desserts (save some space for dessert!) and obviously amazing views. The only thing I didn't like, and this is the first time ever this happened, is that they allowed people to go in and wander around without having a reservation or willingness to eat or drink there. Some people apparently just want to go on the cheap, enjoy the views and not spend one dollar not even on a drink. I think in the past the staff was more strict about it and now they appeared to be more relaxed about it. I hope they start being more strict again because if you're there and paying for it, you want to thoroughly enjoy the experience. We had dinner and a group of about ten people, not spending one dime, was all around us taking pictures, talking loud, and not caring at all about us eating there. The staff asked them to move on but they only reacted reluctantly and stayed too long, it was a bit of a negative for the experience of our guests but this was the first time ever. Also the first time ever, so I guess something in their policy has changed, was that some people were hanging out around the bar where we had drinks before we ate, and also these people were not drinking anything, just taking up space of other people who are willing to pay to be there. I hope they get their act together again soon. But as I said, we will go back because this was the first time these things happened and otherwise it's always, always a fantastic experience!

We had drinks and dinner at this place. For being in MBS, the venue is totally over rated. Too expensive for the value! We tried the sushi and it was average nothing spectacular. Our waiter for the drinks was a guy with a bitter face, not welcoming at all. There were lots of tables outside (not reserved) and they were still pushing us to eat inside. Honestly for spending that much money, you should at least be given the table you want. Overall too much money for what it is.
1
Bartenders could all do with a lesson on smiling and greeting customers. This place seems to not want your repeat business. One of the waiters who was trying to walk pass not only did not say 'excuse me' but instead in a fed up tone: 'oh my god, could I have two seconds!' What kinda service is this? Very disappointed with this treatment. Not sure the great view up on top was worth this rude treatment we received. Not a pleasant birthday experience at all. Will definitely NOT be coming back to this bar. Plenty of other rooftop/high rise are to go to
5
Just had a very nice dinner at Cé La Vi Restaurant. If you want to do something special with your spouse or just enjoy yourself: ask for Jess, let her guide you through the menue and then enjoy the dinner with all your senses. Her recommendations of wine resp champagner are excellent: try the Seared Togarashi Tuna with a glass of champagner or the Black Cod with a well suited Sauivgnon Blanc (Astrolabe). Jess serves with professional passion and pleasure. She seems to love food and to share her experiences. So, give it a trial. And while enjoying the food, enjoy the stunning view over Singapore as well
4
Had drinks over sunset with some friends recently. The views were fantastic and good atmosphere as the place was packed. My only gripe is that the drinks service is quite slow, so you better order way ahead!
3
What a disappointment! Overrated, bad service, food was average and grossly overpriced for the quality and quantity.
5
A great first meal in Singapore. The food was delicious can recommend the black cod and the lemongrass chicken! Exceptional service from sithra made our night extra special.
4
the view from this restaurant is really amazing! During the night the club is very exciting and the city lights make you say WOW!
5
Amazing food, amazing view, good service and very snazzy! Busy the night we were there but our waitress was really on the ball. We had pre dinner drinks on deck which we had ordered in restaurant but decided we wanted to have them out side. They could not have been nicer. Carried our drinks out for us, and suggested we peruse menu before we went so we could have dinner on return to table.It was a bit noisy, but I loved it. We had a variety of small dishes and can't recommend the pork belly lollipops highly enough. A bit exxy but we enjoyed it! We finished up with a night cap on the deck and at this stage, it was quite late in the evening and it was extremely busy and there were many smokers outside. Best to go earlier in the night
5
Visited here for a honeymoon treat. It was beautiful. The views are so of the best Singapore has to offer. You definitely need to reserve a table. Staff were friendly, accommodating and attentive. The food my husband and I had was great. We had the pork ribs to start and I had the lemongrass chicken which was spicy but delightful! Absolute compliments to the chef :) Yes it is expensive and you could get a meal just as nice for a lot less however, if it is a romantic experience you are after, 100% worth it.
5
On the top of the hotel Marina Sand there's CE LA VIE. Very special and nice place. You have to go there: once in the evening (the view is magical) and during the day for panorama. The prices are normal for Singapore. For exemple beers start from 16 SD without taxes, cocktails from 25 SD. Just take a drink and enjoy the view.
4
Went for first time to catch the view it is amazing. A must see so buy one drink as fairly expensive although most of Singapore's alcoholic drinks are & stand at a high table. Then make your way to the restaurant/bar next door same name at the bow of the ship & enjoy.. We chose to sit & have a meal with was exceptional. I advise to ring & book a table right on the balcony edge. View not as glitzy but you see the east of Sing which is still stunning. Price similar to any hotel restaurant with a view
3
At this height, what you really want is peace and quite. Not rowdy and pretending-youths spending their family fortune (or perhaps their weekly pocket money).Everything here is EXPENSIVE. And worse, they make you spend more. There is no let-off for anybody as they hope you drop your entire life savings on overpriced champagne and food that is really no far better than McDonalds.Crude as my review sounds, this is my point of view, however much you may wish to challenge it. My opinion still counts.I'd rather take my dollar to Spago or Flight57 for a better, more peaceful time, in quiet comforts, soaking in quality drinks and stunning views of Singapore
4
First off we had the Stuffed Chicken Wings and the Pork Ribs. For our mains we had Lobster - the truffle oil was a surprise and was okay. Additionally got the Lamb Ribs which was somewhat sweet for me. Be that as it may, the Strip Loin was great. The significant disadvantage that kinda destroyed the experience was our table area. The numerous lights of the passageway had an excess of glare which spills towards our table. In addition everybody was passing here making this area VERY INDESiRABLE (see photograph). The lighting resembled a fly staying nearby which you need to whack. On an alternate note - Our server Alihan (not sure about the name spelling) was exceptionally attentive and gracious. Decent Guy to converse with
5
A special place . The view , the decor , ambiance and food and drinks. First class. Very nice, romantic venue.
4
After hard working, this place is waiting you to relaxing. Let's time to see Singapore from top eye and relaxing with some drink. Enjoys.
4
The locations of this restaurant takes the prize. The food is nice, but portions are very small. The service is great.
5
Great food complimented by the amazing view. The pork belly pops are fantastic as is the gooey chocolate pudding. The bar for after dinner drinks is a great spot to hang out.
5
very nice dinner ambience.. excellent customer service from Jess.. she recommended us the right choices which suit our taste perfectly...
5
The view is stellar, the food is tasty and the cocktails aren't bad either. While it was a little insulting to be reminded of the minimum spend both before the lift and on arriving at the the restaurant, I can understand that there is a necessity to pre-warn people that this is not an inexpensive restaurant - I think you could figure that one out by the view. It is stellar.We had the degustation and everything was a delight. I didn't choose the matching wines, and quite fortunately they had one of my favourite Barossa GSMs on hand which was a bonus.Great for a special occasion, fab for tourists such as ourselves. I don't have any negatives. Even for the least romantic couple on Earth, a little sparkle rubs off
4
Great vibe and the best views of Singapore from the top. Just say at the bottom of the lift that you're going up to Ce La Vi for a a drink and it's free! The drink is cheaper than paying to go up. Views are great at night but I think better by day. Go to both sides and see over the Gardens in the Bay as well as the Quays. Food is very reasonably priced for S'pore, but we had to wait ages for a beef burger as it was coming from 'a different kitchen from the salad'!
5
Ce La Vi is my ultimate favourite restaurant / skybar and place to spend quality time in Singapore. Most awesome view in the city, fanciest cocktails, coolest atmosphere. I love the classy side of CLV in the evening, as well as the more casual side in the afternoon. I will going back there for sure
5
The Ce La Vi Restaurant sits atop the Marina Bay Sands complex in a newly developed part of Singapore. It has expansive views over the city, the harbour and waterfront areas. We were lucky to have a table that took in the best of the views.The food was delicious. Our party of four went for a series of small plates - to share and widen the taste sensations
4
Situated on top of Marina Bay Sands Ce La Vi is a great place to have a drink or dinner while enjoying stunning views of the city. The food is tasty and served in an inspiring way. It is a happening place and will give you a glimpse of the ocean, Gardens on the Bay as well as the port, the science museum among other things.
4
Pleasantly surprised by the good food at this restaurant at top of Sands. Spectacular view of Singapore. Great food and service but note $80 U.S. dollar minimum, which is easy to get there with a drink or two, app, and entree.
5
Expensive, sometimes too crowded, not the greatest music but I love it. Just standing up by the balcony, overlooking the whole of marina bay and feeling the breeze.... I just stand there and smile :)
5
Great place to have dinner! The views are awesome and the lights show of the city is worth it. Definetelly a place you must go once at least!
1
Average food
Appalling service with complete apathy for customers
If you're willing to tolerate all of that just for a view and still pay SGD 150 per person for a drink and a main, only then should you head to this place.
5
We celebrated our daughters 18th birthday with dinner at Ce La Vi..The service was excellent and the food was beautifully presented and tasty.For that extra special night I could not recommend the place high enough. The views and ambience just spectacular A particular mention to our waitress Sithra who made the occasion even more magicalThank
5
Initially I was ushered to a table without a view. However, upon request, one of the waitress ushered to me to the tables with the ocean view( the best view ever). We had Angus beef and the mentaiko truffle lobster for mains. I was very pleased with the lobster as it was the best I ever had with the mentaiko sauce and truffle taste. The well served medium rare Angus beef is ok. We were being served by the waitress name ' Jess' who was super attentive to our requests and very friendly towards us. We were very well taken care by her and she was rather interactive. She recommended us to visit the club lounge with the receipt for the meal. Otherwise the cover charge would be $38/pax. Overall, I would really recommend this place!thumbs up! It's really a 10/10.
4
Went for high tea and loved it. Views are incredible and we had a beautiful high tea to celebrate my birthday. Generous servings and adored the Sakura Flower Tea. Staff were fabulous and offered a glass of ice for one of our party who wanted her tea iced. Much better way to get the view than the sky deck. We followed up with a cheeky cocktail and was the perfect way to spend an afternoon and take some time out. Highly recommend and good value for money. Of course the alcohol is expensive but it is everywhere in Singapore and for a place with those kind of views I actually thought it was not much different to other less fancy bars. Take the time out and spoil yourself. We went late afternoon and didn't require a booking. Although did have to move 3 times to get a great table along the edge. Only complaint I wish they did take bookings for high tea as we waited for a couple of people who were drinking water to finish so we could get their table which had a better view. Would like to see better tables being allocated to people who are actually spending money there. Otherwise loved it
2
I understand you are paying for the view and for the 5 star feel... However I've been to many 5 star restaurants with a view and this was not worth what you pay. It cost us $308 SPD for 1x drink each and our food. The cocktails didn't taste very good, I didn't even finish mine (and trust me, that's not like me at all). The food was "tasty" but simple, and after we left I ended up having a second dinner as I was still starving. As I said, I'm accustomed to this type of dining, and I think you're better off spending money else where.
5
Went there for a special afternoon with my brother.. It was not so busy & we managed a nice scenic table with sofas.. Had a few items for us since we are vegetarians but it was not for the food that we visited the place.. The views are really lovely.. Nice to be atop the iconic boat of MBS, at level 57.. There are 2 restaurants & the infinity pool atop the boat.. Also an observation deck on the level just below.. Dress code & cover charge applies on specific days/times so do check before you visit.. I would think its better to spend at the restaurant here than buy the observation deck tickets ;
5
You cannot get a better view and given the food was just as great as the view, this is a must go Restaurant when you are in Singapore. Its not cheap, so it does come with a price tag but the Restaurant is full at most times so you do have to make sure that you have a table booked. The Black Cod was just fantastic but the entire menu is a treat. The only small downer was that the Service wasn't as great as the rest of the Restaurant and would think it deserves more attention especially thinking of what one pays but Food was stunning, the view is unbeatable so for sure worth a visi
4
Very good experience at Cé La Vi Singapore. Staff was very attentive and friendly, food was very good and the setting was... WOW! You get an amazing view from Singapore. Expect high end prices to match!
5
A place worth going. We've been here about three years ago and celebrated my sis' birthday. We do really had a great time🎂🍾 I'd like to go there again😍
4
We just went up for the view and a happy hour cocktail. It was so crowded that we decided to not even bother trying to get a cocktail, but the view is excellent, and this is a good tip if you don't want to pay the $22 per person for the observation deck one floor below
5
What a view, and not to mention the friendly staff. Was walking around in the area and took a decision to soak in the sites by getting an afternoon beer at the Ce La Vi as opposed to the buying a ticket for the observation deck. Was great, walked in without a reservation on a weekend, the staff out there got us a table and very friendly/ efficient in serving us. One of the best thing to do in Singpore- just get up there and chill
3
We arrived for lunch at 1 30, with high hopes. However, we found that our table was not ready yet, so we agreed to have a drink on the outside platform; very expensive of course! By 2:30, the table was still not ready, and most of us were starving, so we asked if we could eat where we were. They said this was not possible, and on closer examination we found that the restaurant occupied the inside space, but only one third of the outside space (the rest being occupied by the bar). Then the table was finally ready, and we were treated to an excellent, (exorbitantly expensive) lunch. To sum up, if you are travelling with a large company and want to eat outside, prepare to wait, and when you do get the table be prepared to empty your wallet
5
Here you can experience dining at the 57th floor skypark. The food is Asian fusion style, small portions to share. The taste of all the dishes we had (4 starters, 4 mains, 4 desserts) is very good. The meat from the small ribs for instance, fall from the bone and has a very good marinated taste. The sashimi salad is more salad than sashimi. The view is great, and it feels very special to be able to sit here. Take some time to make a reservation, we started a few months in advance. It is also a tedious process as they only start to accept reservations in few weeks in advance and do require some re-confirmations. Tables start at 18:00 (until 20:00) or from 20:15 onwards. Bring a credit card with enough limit (minimum spend per person is 80 Singapore dollar) but the experience, view and food, is worth it.
4
Privileged location on the rooftop of the beautiful Marina Bay Sands hotel. The food was good, so were the drinks. Service was also above average. Would have chosen differently if I knew it was going to be so crowded at the bar (which is also on the terrace). Not a wise choice if what you are thinking is a candle light romantic dinner.
1
Tried forward booking (1 month in advance) for dinner on the week following this year's Formula 1 weekend. Was told they can't confirm reservations until a week before date because their "menu hadn't been finalised".Sounds like they're still trying to figure out their extortion plans for those that intend on visiting remotely close to F1 weekend
5
First time ever dinning in at ce le vie.Firstly the food,The fried scallops and baby squid was so scrumptious and it was so filling. Ended the appetisers with the most divine chocolate fondant, the chefs did an amazing job.Secondly all these food were accompanied with the best whiskey sour and chocolate martini I have ever tasted. I have to say the bartender shanky guru was so friendly and efficient and he did a superb job with the drinks and made the experience at ce le vi most enjoyable. Last but not least all the staff at ce le vie were so friendly, warm and patient. Amongst all staff, diyana was so warm and went the extra mile to give such an excellent service. I would definitely recommend anyone to dine here as the food is Excellent and also the service is so good. Not forgetting how amazing the location and ambience is. 
4
We had been there 3 years ago when it was still named Ku De Ta and we returned this year.The view is amazing, but the food isn't as good as it was. The music played is very pleasant.Ask for a table with a view because some tables have limited view
4
Obviously prices are high but the view is stunning. Could get really crowded if you are to late. Must see.
1
Poor service and even poorer food.
The only thing positive about it is its view, but the fact that you are only allowed to stay in a certain part of the area seems extremely cheap to me. I wouldn't consider coming back again.
4
Clearly expensive at $28 per person - one drink included - but stunning views so worth it in the end.
5
I was travelling solo and visited the restaurant to dine, Arlan took extra care to ensure I enjoyed my visit there and made it very special.
3
Wonderful view. Too expensive food and drinks although you don't pay entrance at all. Good service. It has no protection for the sun. The tables were exposed to the sun and it's very difficult to stay there for a long time.
4
Previous reviews were a bit negative on Tripadvisor but frankly we had a nice time. The staff was very friendly and professional and we enjoyed really nice food. Combined with the nice view, it gave us a very nice lunch. Yes expensive but that could be expected
4
Food is way overpriced and not that good. But if you just go there for a drink (and only have one), it's still a great value for the amazing views that you will enjoy. Great for both day and night, just make sure it's not cloudy or raining.
2
Waiters were rude to me when I sat down outside even though I had a dinner booking. Went inside for dinner and spent S$289 on two mains, one dessert and a bottle of wine. I asked a waitress about one of the items on the menu and she had no clue. The chicken was fatty and tasted awful - told the waiter and he agreed, even contributing that it is sometimes described as chewy (!) and did nothing about it other than to bring me the bill. Oh, that's after he'd taken the bill to another table and got them to sign it (before the customer noticed and told him that wasn't their food). It's like they have a potentially high quality restaurant but staffed it with school kids and amateurs (including in the kitchen) and spend nothing on the cheap ingredients for their food. The only reason I gave 2/5 is the spectacular views. I will never be eating there again or recommending it
4
Let's just start by saying that this place is expensive so anyone who complains about the price should simply not bother going because like any 'location' restaurant you are paying for the views as much as the food. And the views are of course spectacular...as you would expect.So what do you get for your $100 / $150 per person?Well, massively overpriced drinks in one of the coolest rooftop bars you'll find anywhere in the world.And really very good food... Which surprised me since many reviews have been negative about the food but I thought it was great.Firstly, whilst it is a la Carte based it's not served a la Carte as such, it's more like sharing plates tapas style where dishes are brought when ready and put in the middle of the table so you can share them. This is a good thing for a couple of reasons: firstly, because you try different stuff and secondly, because the portions are quite big you might find yourself spending a bit less money sharing than you might otherwise if you went the traditional route (starters/mains/desserts).Service is also fast and professional.Oh, and did I mention that the drinks are expensive? $144 for a bottle of Muga that was perhaps 4 times the store price (though Singapore has very high import duties on booze anyway)...and that was one of the cheapest bottle on offer.Anyway, since it costs $20+/person just to go up to the skypark that's $80 for a family of 4, why not make an evening of it? And in fact, we found that except for the price of wine it compared quite well $ for $ with the restaurants in Clarke Quay so for a "last night" treat in Singapore it's a great way to go out in style
4
It was a beautiful place and the staff was nice but the food we are and the money we paid was really not worth it. The food was tasty but there wasn't something special about it. I think we paid more for the place and name than what we got served
5
Food was great and the view was spectacular. Great place for a snack or drink. However, it's pricey and you might feel uncomfortable if underdressed.
4
This is just an amazing place ! The architecture is really interesting, the view is incredible , service is excellent, bar is just super, food is appropriate and aligned without being gastronomic but that's not the goal. To do, you can't miss this !
5
Amazing location on d 57th floor of Tower 3 at Marina Bay Sands..Its overlooking d river on one side n Gardens by d bay on the other..Breathtaking view on both sides n to top it all there is a roof top swimming pool too there..So take a drink n enjoy d spectacular view from there..A must go.
4
The restaurant offers great range of choices concerning food and wine. From French cuisine to Singaporean and everything else in between. Besides the nice atmosphere inside the restaurant the views from the city are amazing. Weather permitting, outside is as good, if not better, than the inside. Check it out before choosing a table
2
While the food was great the restaurant is way too dark, if we wanted to eat in the dark we could go to NOX.Other than that it was so disappointing to have called in earlier to make sure they do something special for our anniversary and have the waitress ask if we were celebrating anything and tell her, only to leave without even a desert being offered..Go for the food, not the service or ambiance.
4
I'm ambivalent about Ce La Vie. It really does provide spectacular views over Singapore and the service is very good. Our lunch shared plates were great on two counts and average on one). I suspect the evening experience is superb, but I feel the 'been there, done that' box is well ticked on this one and there's probably more fun and interest to be found dining in Singapore closer to the ground
4
Wow, what a place. Can get up to the shy around area as long as you have a reservation. No need to pay extra for the observation deck as the view from the restaurant/bar is great. Food was a fusion style and all dishes were superb. All washed down with a bottle of Amarone. Squid and Australian Wagu beef were excellent. Fabulous place as long as someone else is paying the bill
5
We were there on our honeymoon. My husband had planned a surprise meal. All the staff made the experience so very special. We were particularly helped by Rita, who gave wonderful advice about the food. My husband and I enjoyed the atmosphere, spectacular view and yummy food. Expect to pay for the experience, but it was a special one and was worth it. Recommended
4
located on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel this restaurant offers an excellent view of the city as well as to the sea. we were seated outdoors as the weather was pleasent. the service is exceptional, the food is really amazing. the Chef needs to be complimented for it. the food and drinks are on the expensive side but it was worth every bit. the music too is not very hard on you and you can have a good conversation around the table
4
Nice view and very interesting and flavorful cocktails on top of the hotelThis was an afternoon of cocktails and a couple of small plates. The view is great of both the city and the bay and we watched the clouds roll out and then back in. They produced some very flavorful and inventive cocktails - the 007 martini is shown below - using tea-infused vermouth! The tempura was excellent, light and crispy and the pork belly very flavorful and tender. It's a little pricey , $25 SD per drink, but you're paying for the view.During our brief stay it rained twice, and it took them only minutes to secure, then re-open the outdoor portion after a thunderstorm
5
Incredible view, incredible food. Went there 3 times in a week . Will remain as a mandatory place to,enjoy each time i will come,in Singapore.
4
Decent view and 5 star restaurant yet.. The service sucks. I would think it's some normal sky bar with average rating. Food was all right but waiters suck.
4
Arrived 20min early for my reservation.. Was directed to bar to wait as they said I was early... Strict on timing even though the restaurant was rather vacant at the point.Food Food served 'asian' style... So they are served in middle of table for sharing rather than the one dish for each diner type.. Food was overall good and yummy.. Beef was really good.. Tried their signature chocolate lava cake.. Rich and chocolatey.ServiceAttentive... Lady who took most of our orders was cheerful and made the whole ambience warm.Restaurant took note of my request and did a small decor with candle for hubby on the lava cake.. Nice touch. Pricey and has a minimum spend for dinner per pax. Overall nice restaurant with good food. Special note: View is lovely but didn't get much view throughout dinner as not seated by the balcony area.
4
My friends and I went up to the bar for a drink to enjoy the view, instead of going to the skypark - its cheaper!;-)The view was nice!You need to get dressed up for the bar too. For my taste it wasn't chilled out enough - but if you like a little ching ching then this is your place!It was a good experience and i am glad I went - but i think i will go and enjoy the rooftop bars near Chinatown in future
2
Their staff is super rude and discourteous. We had booked a table in advance. The lady escorting us was walking very fast without looking at us and was 2 meters ahead of us when entering the cordoned off sitting area. Two other staff members stopped us very rudely and said this is paid area where are you going. We were paying a lot to celebrate my sister in laws birthday and were really put off by this behaviour. The food was quite sad and expensive. The wine was good and the view was amazing. Expected much better service and behaviour from the staff.
4
I chose this restaurant to celebrate my own birthday with hubster, and it's a memory that will live long.As you exit the lifts (elevators to my American readers), the view made me gasp. Think of any superlative and double it, triple it, ice it and put a cherry on it. This place is impressive.The staff (like all in Singapore) are very professional, friendly and glad to have you there. We had a good table in a roped off area (but that didn't stop literally EVERYONE climbing through for 'view selfies') . I shooed a few away, then a Waitress-Cum-Ninja Bodyguard took over, dragging anyone who dared lean forward back to their spot behind the rope. Made me giggle.The tasting menu was divine! As was the accompanying Gin cocktails, Champagne, Wine and boy oh boy did we sink a few.Gorgeous place, gorgeous clientele, schamazing views. Breathtaking night.HIGHLY RECOMMENDE

We had read a lot of great stuff about this restaurant on-line. All the on-line info raved about the beautiful view and how the art of Modern Asian cuisine revolves around drama, spectacle and theatre that come together to create an unparalleled epicurean adventure. End result......yes the view is to die for! The ambiance is a bit stuffy and you need to deal with all the traffic the trendy night club attracts. The food was AVERAGE.....nothing jumped off the plate and nothing made my taste buds crave another bite. And the service was sub-par at best. We always needed to chase down some help rather than feel we were being tended to. In my opinion, for true FOODIES, not the place to have a meal you will get nostalgic about

We dined as a group of 6 adults and 2 children. We ordered several share plates and all were very delicious. It is an expensive restaurant, wines were Priced off the scale!!!!As are all alcoholic drinks in Singapore. We only went for the view, I'm sure Chinatown would have the same tasty morsels for a fraction of the price
4
Located at the top of the Sands Hotel the view is amazing! The service was very well and also the food was quite well. As one would expect, it is more kind of fancy luxury restaurant and not cheap.I was a bit disappointed not to be allowed to walk to visitor areas surrounding the restaurant for a better view to take some photographs
4
After initially having to stand at a table, we kept our eye out for someone leaving. The reserved tables are only available to those who are willing to buy a bottle of champagne for over $100SGD plus service charge plus tax, which was a rip off!When the food arrived, the burger was good (although VERY overpriced) but you are paying a premium for the view.Not sure if do it again but it was a great experience given I'd never been there before.Sorry about the selfie
4
No doubt one of the best view. Since the Sands rise from the sea, there's no barrior to block the view. Enjoy city side for night view and ocean side for crowded parking lot for ships.
Food can be rather normal.
5
The restaurant offers excellent dishes with world class presentation. The Boston lobster is very nice. Must not forget to bring camera along. :)
5
Nice food. Great setting. Two couples $500 spent. Great views. Celebrated my 40th there with visitors from Australia who loved it!
5
Nice restaurant, delicious food, good service and amazing view over the Marina Bay. The restaurant offers mainly Asian food.
3
The title says it all. Ambiance is amazing. Food is partly at food court level. Expected more, considering how expensive this place is.
4
Good food with good portion size and the service was great!
We sat at a round table near the window (indoor seating) and we had a good view of the skyline. I like it when the restaurant is bright with natural ambience for lunch.
4
We had dinner in Ce La Vi restaurant while visiting Singapore. The restaurant has a great 360 degree views of Singapore. The food is tasty but a bit expensive and not really "Singaporean". I guess you pay for the view as well. The service is good, too. The restaurant could be a bit noisy because the bar is just outside the restaurant, with people having drinks and chatting loudly. Anyway, a place worth going, if you visit Singapore
5
So I dined here on May 27th for my 31st Birthday & it was everything I expected & more. The views from the top where we were seated were incredible, the whole of the skyline was visible. You can't dine here on a budget though, it's super expensive but everything from the starters to the desserts are fantastic.There is a dress code but you'd want to look fancy for a evening at this restaurant... Don't forget to hang around at the bar after for some great cocktails
4
Visited the Ce La Vi bar on a saturday night before 10pm. It wasnt too crowded so guest could thoroughly enjoy the view while sipping on their drinks. Drinks were reasonably priced for the localities. Only downside is that the bar area doesnt have much seating places. Also the bar enforces a dress code after 10pm so guest need to be aware of the requirement.
5
You can't beat the atmosphere here. The 360 degree views of Singapore are breathtaking and the food is delicious. This is not a cheap place to eat but if you are visiting Singapore for the first time and are looking for a great experience I definitely recommend a meal here. I went at sunset and was blown away. The food itself is also excellent, although not necessarily the most Singaporean food
5
Ce La Vi is THE spot to enjoy a great meal and soak up the incredible view of Singapore from the very top of Marina Bay Sands. Go for dinner and marvel at the city lights. You won't be disappointed.
4
Followed other review tips re getting to the sky view. Main thing to note is that the access at floor 57 is the bar which overlooks the viewing area which you can pay for at $21 each. We went to floor 57 the bar and you can get a beer for $16 plus tax etc. Which is great deal as you can see just as much. We had cocktails at $24 plus tax which was still well worth it to sit and enjoy the great views.
4
My daughter and I had dinner and chose the degustation menu. The food was great but think if I went again I wouldn't choose the wine matching as it was quite expensive for 4 glasses of wine - total bill was $750. Fantastic views and we sat outside on a beautiful evening. Also ate one night at Salt Grill and Sky Bar, which is Luke Mangen's restaurant on the 55th floor of the ION building - views also spectacular and so was the food and this time $440 and think this was a better option
4
CeLaVi used to be called KuDeTa. It is an outside restaurant on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and has absolutely stunning views of Marina Bay, provided you sit on the right side for that. The other side has very nice views of the big, artificial trees of the Gardens by the Bay. The food is mainly Asian fusion and is very nice
4
4 of us had lunch at the restaurant & the food was good. However, we thought that after paying over $200 per couple for lunch, we thought that we would be able to go out on the viewing platform to take photos. WE WERE WRONG! It's an additional cost to go out to the viewing platform. RonCFrom Australia.
5
Excellent views of Singapore and I suggest you book dinner just before sunset so you can see the views in daytime and also see a sunset and nighttime views of the gardensExcellent food and service and our waiter, Yul, gave us some perfect recommendations.Pork rib and pork lollipop starters with chicken wrapped in leaves. Mains were Grilled Salmon, Beef curry and sides of Rice and vegetables.Desserts were chocolate fondant and also ice-cream, vanilla and salted egg yolk. AMAZING!You will not be disappointed
4
we were here for my birthday in early June and had booked a table for dinner. the views were spectacular and the food was good too, though we certainly had much better in Singapore. the problem was the clientele... as such a tourist attraction we had people walking around our table constantly (as we were sat right on the edge of the balcony) to take photographs, not what you want or expect when you're trying to enjoy the view and dinner that you've paid for. most people came across from the bar area to take photos. i did inform the waiter and fortunately after about the 5th time, they began stopping people from standing over our table... anyway, the view was second to none and the waiter then kindly took us to the VIP area of the bar around the other side of the floor to show us the pool etc. (we weren't staying in the hotel and so this is the only way really that you can get to see it). my recommendation in future would be to visit for drinks, but have food elsewhere, it was pricey and the atmosphere was spoilt by there being so many people constantly walking around the table
2
Gorgeous bar and the view is outstanding as you would expect. We came here for drinks with a friend and were extremely disappointed with the service. Although tables were served around us we had our menus for 25 minutes before I had to go and find a member of staff to serve us. There were no apologies about our length of wait and one waiter claimed it was our fault! Got our bill after deciding to leave once we finished our drinks and they had the audacity to charge service charge!! Extremely disappointed as it could be a great venue

Located at the 57th floor of the marina bay sands hotel, this restaurants provide you with a magnificent view of the city. Try to come down early to catch the sunset. Other than that nothing fancy. The restaurant is very crowded and noisy. Packed with tourists visiting the sky deck observatory and taking photos. Don't expect any kind of privacy. Food is average, with an asian fusion concept. Service was not very friendly. Food and wine was very expensive. Other than the view, nothing fancy and something to try once.
2
On the top floor, the best views you have are of those tourists enjoying the views from the terrace on the larger floor downstairs. All views obstructed by other guests, glass, terraces etc....Your presence is allowed to the space around your table; you cannot go through other parts of the restaurant since those areas are designated to the owners of the tables...Reservation is limited to 2 hours with a minimum spend of 80 per head at dinner time...Of the 5 plates we ordered, 1 was pretty good, 1 was OK but perhaps mediocre, and the remaining 3 downright bad; really, better eat at a hawker...Cocktails are fine, service is very kind and professional...Music too loud to enjoy the meal...Not a single reason to be there, really..
4
The atmosphere is really good, the staff is friendly and most importantly, the food is amazing. Less vegetarian options though.
3
The view is limited as the area is small and there is a barrier with some distance. Hence you will not be able to take a decent pic with the scenery compared to 1-altitude rooftop bar.
5
Perfect view from here. Can view a city of Singapore from Skydeck of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Staff very very very nice. Clean. Reasonable price. Perfect
4
Honestly the most amazing views from a bar I've seen, but the over priced food and drinks really did put a damper on the place. Could do with some more fans too!
3
It's all about the view, we saw that waiting G in the queue, shame we went in having experienced the high point for free, my wallet was $300 lighter after dinner!
5
We celebrated my nephew's birthday last night and our dining experience was wonderful! Thanks to the staff for the excellent service. Thanks to Rohanna for accomodating our special request and for going the extra mile.

After travelling the world for 3 months, my husband and I stayed in Singapore for 3 nights as a stopover on the way home. In all our travels, we have never experienced such rude, arrogant staff. We thought we'd sit and have a drink and take in the view of Singapore from the Ce La Vi Bar on the 57th floor. The drinks were incredibly expensive and seemed to be lacking in alcoholic content! Staff were rude and once you've ordered and paid a premium for your drink, you are unable to sit anywhere. We actually had to ask the bar staff several times to return our credit card! Having drunk cocktails in many high rise bars around the world and taken in many a gorgeous view, I would recommend skipping Ce La Vi. Save your money and drink elsewhere
4
I have visited this restaurant for a romantic dinner with my wife. The view is spectacular, the food selection is good, however, the service standard was not up to the level you would expect in such location.My wife and I have enjoyed the evening, but we had to wait for our drinks longer than the usual. Our second round of drinks were not served and we finished our meal without getting the drinks! Their excuse was that the blender in the bar was not working!! Which I found unacceptable.However, the experience was overall satisfactory
5
there are a couple of restaurants on top of the 3 hotel towers, but we were allowed to go take a look to make sure we booked the right one. From the Ce la vi you have a 180 degrees view of the city, take care not to disturb dinner guests too much. The staff were very attentive, the food was perfect and the sunset over Singapore a bonus. Sunset at 17:00 so go early to experience it. Note that you still need to pay extra to be allowed on to the main deck to take photos. Yes it is a bit expensive but you only live once
2
It starts with the reservation process - after first reservation online I received a confirmation - so far it was perfect. A day before we went to the restaurant somebody from an unknown number called me but did not leave a message since I could not pick up the phone right away. A few minutes later I received an email from CeLaVi asking me to reconfirm my reservation otherwise they will cancel it. So I reconfirmed the confirmation to make sure. They then reconfirmed it once again - how strange and annoying. We where sitting outside, nice view to the city, but very crowded, lots of people  around, on one side from the bar taking pictures just over or through our table, on the other side the crowd from the roof top view point - so not really peaceful. Then we received two menus with interesting sets and when we wanted to order it we've been told that this is for lunch only - so they brought as another menu for dinner - not professional at all.When I wanted to order a wine I've been told that this wine is not longer available  - why dont they remove it from the list?Finally the food was good - but definitely overpriced.The staff, especially two Filipinos where very nice and lovely.Resume: another pricy restaurant in Singapore that I would not recommend if you're looking for fine dining at a quiet and peaceful place. If its for the view only and you're willing to pay much more then go for it
4
Wednesday night drink with a spectacular view, nice music and good vibe! First drink for us, girls were free the second was quite expensive but it isn't that surprising in Singapore. It is not a cheap city, but georgeous!!
4
You could not dream of a better view in Singapore. We took the tasting menu and every meal was awesome. Service was great. Do not miss this place when travelling to Singapore.
5
Went for our wedding anniversary . And was serve by a staff named Rita . She was great and had great attitude . Well done ! Will visit again in near future and hope to meet Rita again !!!!
5
The food is second to the view here. You simply forget to eat and just keep marvelling at the view from this place. A must when in Singapore.
5
Didn't have a booking. Found our way to top of Marina Bay Sands, mainly to look at view. Ce la Vie had a table for 2 and were happy to oblige us. The view is amazing. The outside tables are dimly lit, so dim that you get a book light with each menu. I guess this was so the interior lights don't detract from the view. It was great also watching the hubbub of the adjacent bar.I loved the food. Thought it was delicious
3
Amazing views of the city. Took it in for the sunset and were not disappointed. Food was ok, not great for the price (each guest must spend at least $80 before drinks). We were expecting a bit more from the taste and presentation but guess when they have the views, they can charge what they want,, including a $12,000 bottle of wine
4
Had business lunch there with 16 pax of us. They joined 2 tables to accommodate all of us. I suggest best for 5-6 pax. Food okay but wouldn't say awesome. We go for mango sticky rice and coconut based dessert. Personally prefer mango The view nearby window is awesome. Overall is woth for money except for the service crews didn't look friendly when serving us.
5
Yes it's expensive but the food is gorgeous and the view is just sublime. Sushi is spot on but if your getting a starter and a main you are financially better off getting one of the set menus, as this way you get more for your money.
4
Great food. Really excellent: different + well prepared. Very good wine list to go with it. Too bad the lights are so low: dimming lights is good to create a warm feel, but there is a point below which you can hardly see the food and that is probably a step too far. Bring some more light and people will rate you excellent
5
It was a really great experience when we were taken care by Mr Leo Lopez and his team. We moved table location and ended up at a place with the best view looking over the ocean and Garden by the bay.It really made our 2nd Anniversary a very special occasion last night!
3
It's a cool dining experience but we were expecting a lot more from the tasting menu. It was OK but nothing too special. Still worth a visit though.
4
I knew it would not be cheap but I had to give it a try. I enjoyed an amazing Grilled Prawn Salad: Baby spinach, dry miso, parmesan, truffle oil. Perfect light lunch with world class service and spectacular view.
4
The location and view from Ce La Vi is unbeatable however you are paying for these views through the bar. Wine is a minimum of $25 a glass which is very pricey.
5
The building itself was beautiful, we booked the table for 3 and the restaurant was overlooking the view of the city. As we waited for our table we went to the club lounge where we had drinks. The food was fantastic, we started with two starters to share among three of us, which was the spicy sashimi salad and the chef's sashimi selection. The sauce for the spicy salad was superb and very delicious. The sashimi, you can just taste the freshness the sashimi's were great!Onto our main course we have the pepper prawns, would be nice if you compliment it with rice because it would be quite rich in flavour if you were to have it on its own. My parents liked the dish and said it has a very good peppery smell.Our second main was the black cod miso which again you should have with rice because the flavours are intense but delicious!And I had the US Angus steak which I think was cooked to perfection. I asked for medium and that's what I got, although for some people who normally orders theirs medium but on this occasion it looked medium to rare. But the steak melted in my mouth! It was that good. It was served with a creamy spinach and a wasabi sauce with the kick. Staff were very attentive and lovely! As all the people in Singapore we met were so friendly! Would love to visit again and would be interested in the hotel too!
4
After meetings all day my work colleagues and I adjourned for drinks and some food at the top of the 'building with a boat on top' in Singapore. The restaurant, Ce La Vi, commands spectacular views, make a very decent cocktail and their nibbles - while horrendously expensive - were delicious, it has to be said
4
If there is a girl you want to impress - take her there. Nice setting, specatacular views, good service (Maurice was extremely friendly and polite), good food... Not a top grade cz there are some things to be improved. My fiance ordered a glass of wine, when she got it, she didn't like it (and didn't drink it at all),ordered another one. In every top restaurant we wouldn't be charged for that - especially taking into consideration that we did have a decent amount of food and drinks. That was not the case here. Restaurant policy.Those are the little things that separate good restaurants from top restaurants.However, this place is definitely worth a visi
4
We were a large group of 17. The food was fantastic. I do not particularly care for fish but had a halibut that was cooked to melt in your mouth perfection! The only pet peeve, the crowded and limited number of lifts to the 57th floor.Salt Grill on the 55th floor of the ION Orchard got it right, 2 dedicated elevators straight to the 55th floor food was great there too!
3
We were looking forward to our booking however were disappointed with a very average feeling experience. We felt herded through starting from check in, then trying to get an elevator up to the restaurant for a very long time and then clamoring for a pre-dinner drinks spot. After that, we were seated at a terrible table in the main server walkway with a view of some red spotlights and backs of planters (we eventually got moved to a more comfortable one still with a limited view)....not the experience we expected when booking to enjoy a very nice meal at the top of the Sands. The food at dinner was OK--there was nothing remarkable yet also nothing in particular to complain about

I've lived in Singapore for several years and I frequent this establishment often. The view is beautiful and the atmosphere is generally good. Nevertheless what happened to us tonight was unforgivable. We go here more or less every Friday night however what befell us tonight will stop me (and hopefully you) in my tracks.There was a group of 10 of us (mixed) in the VIP/ Members area and we were minding our own business. The table next to us was causing a bit of a ruckus but as it didn't affect us we didn't really mind. until one of the boys walked over starred us down and then knocked our bottle off the table intentionally he was clearly a drunken idiot gunning for a fight. Though this was inexcusable we let it slide. However the management's reaction I cannot let get away. They just let him get away and go back to his table. There was a bouncer standing right next to us and saw the whole event unfold and yet nothing, no repercussions at all whatsoever.Not only did they allow him to stay in the establishment, they defended him and permitted him to carry on being boisterous and unruly while he threatened us from afar.It was the last thing I expected from an international brand in a country where I once perceived behavior to be fair and justly managed.The bouncers response was that " They spent money and you spent money so I have given them a warning". Don't be fooled for all its glitz and glamour that might seduce an unwitting and well paying patron, they run by some rule that money counts for everything.I (and my friends) felt threatened and unsafe at such an unruly establishment where they allow "Money to talk" in such a way that such behavior is acceptable. The guests where allowed to stay on and continue gesturing and threatening us for the rest of the night when we were just trying to enjoy an innocent Friday night out with friends.I therefore beseech you to not patronage them with your support when they run such a unprofessional and unruly management of their clientele. As an international brand they should regulate and manage their crowd so that the majority of their patrons establish a safe and light hearted environment not an environment that festers animosity and un-comfortableness.For the premium they dictate that's the least they can do.Unfortunately they have lost themselves numerous well paying regulars ( to the VP) that have held them in high regard until now. In a city that offers so much variety and options this has now become one that I would negatively endorse as there are so many more options that would not allow this kind of behavior to occur.Thank you

Ce La Vi is a special place to unwind yourselves with great views and superb drinks. It offers the view of entire marina and even Singapore. You are on the top of Marina bay Sands with superb drinks and great views.The worst part of the place is they only offer you sitting if you consume drinks above S $200 or take a bottle of either wine, whiskey or Vodka.
4
Ladies night spent here was a great choice! Music was great, bartenders were fast, and the customer base were working professionals looking for fun night out (unlike some other bars where you get the rowdy crowd).
5
Fine food with great environment view, suggest to having dinner or a drinks here without paying extra to visit the sky deck.
5
We booked in advance for our Wedding Anniversary. We were seated directly over the Trees of Gardens by the Bay. Service was amazing and the extra touches made this an unforgettable evening!
5
Spectacular view, good japaneese food, careful service (they proposed us to be moved in an outdoor table, as soon as it was possible), cool DJ music and live guitar together. High price, but in line with our expectations.Our first visit, we hope to come back in another special occasion once expats in Singapore
5
Absolutely stunning views. Food is above average but not exceptional. The view, however, is a once-in-a-lifetime. The restaurant and bar are on the roof over looking all of Singapore. The bar is very small as is the restaurant area so reservations ate strongly recommended / which should be made well advance of your visit. Super expensive so be prepared
5
Right off the bat - excellent service by a lady called Rita. She was meticulous in serving my wife and I from the time we were seated till the last minute. Her food recommendations are great and practical. Very friendly. Made our anniversary celebration very memorable!Food was good, but some portions were small. Which made Rita's recommendation so important for 1st time diners like my wife and I in selecting the dishes that are nice, filling and reasonable. View is great! Get to see the flyer and Gardens by the bay from the restaurant side. The other side is opened to hotel guests only, not much of a big deal. Restaurant is quiet and while the lounge side (drinks) is more lively. Great and recommended!I spent about SGD 200 plus for 2 pax inclusive taxes. Min spending of 80 SGD per pax

We were a group of four older Australians in transit to Europe and decided to take a day in Singapore to break the journey. Part of that was to go to Marina Bay for drinks and perhaps dinner. My wife and I have enjoyed drinks at the separate bar at Ce La Vi previously and wanted our travelling partners to also enjoy the views from the skydeck.We arrived at 5:20pm, the sun from the West was sizzling and we decided that dinner at the restaurant with drinks would be the better option.When we approached the reception at the main restaurant we advised the gentleman that we did not have a reservation and we were wondering of we could have drinks before dinner. We were promptly and slightly rudely informed that the restaurant was not open until 6pm and to come back then. We were directed to another bar further down the deck facing directly at the sun. We gave that a miss, but noted that the Ce La Vi had a table of guests outside on the Eastern and breezy side of the restaurant. We again approached reception as to whether we might also have a table in this area for drinks etc. We were advised that dinner was available at $80SGD per head and yes we could have a table provided we spent $80SGD for food. OK we said and were taken to that roped off area of the restaurant.Our drink orders were taken by a young waitress, two beers and some Cuvees for the ladies, later a Terres de Berne Rose for $118SGD, of average quality. At 6:10pm, a third table of guests were seated in our area and provided with menus, we endeavoured to attract the attention of our waitress or one of the three other staff serving our area to also obtain a dinner menu. After attracting the attention of the supervisor at his desk they eventuated.When our orders were taken our waitress advised that, as we were not having the degustation menu, there was no guarantee that the meals would come at the same time. Wha...? Our entrees did in fact all come together, excellent foie gras for the ladies, a really tasty spicy seafood soup for the writer and a chefs platter for the other (a sashimi platter). We all complemented the quality and taste of the food. This restaurant would best be described as Asian Fusion with a good helping of Japanese influenceFor mains the men enjoyed a 100gm waygu sirloin for $64SGD and beef tenderloin $46SGD, both cooked to perfection, melt in the mouth with subtle sauces accompanying them. The ladies enjoyed the Sauteed Prawns, went down a treat.During the period between entre and main we began to note various issues with the staff. Potential patrons would come up to the roped area to determine if a table was available, they were completely ignored by the supervisor, our waitress was off looking at the views with another young waiter who seemed to be trying to become friendly and the fourth waiter just talked to the supervisor, also ignoring these potential guests. Most walked away, one or two became agitated and gained the attention of the supervisor who redirected them back to the main desk and our favorite receptionist.Also during this time we ordered some red wine to enjoy with the beef. The wine arrived with the main courses and I know wine should be served at room temperature in some climates, but not in Singapore at 34 degrees. But we didn't need to worry about that as the wine must have been stored directly in the sun and was hotter than 34 degrees, ...undrinkable.There was no point sending it back so we ordered glasses of ice to place into our wine glasses. The staff had absolutely no idea what we were doing, nor understood what was required in serving wine, they were not trained.Total bill was $674 SGD, ...we achieved our $80SGD per head.In summary, great views, fine food, shoot the staff,they need training and an almost contemptuous attitude driven by the senior members of front of house.Would we go back..nope
3
Definitely worth going here for a drink and experiencing the view rather than paying for Skypark and having no drink! View spectacular. Beverage list is extensive. The service is ok, but needs to be better for the prices that you pay. Definitely worth a visit while in Singapore
4
This restaurant is atop the Marina Bay Sands, if you are not going to eat here you must buy a drink to take in the view which is amazing. Although the cost for a beer and a coke zero at $28.25 SGD is certainly a bit steep, it's definitely worth the money. We didn't eat here but the food at others tables looked delicious. A relaxing couple of hours were spent here soaking up the view. Good attentive service from pleasant and thoughtful staff
3
We had lunch yesterday. Started out well , sitting outside with magnificent views. Server was helpful and explained the menu. Halfway through our meal we moved indoors because it was raining. From then on we felt invisible. Staff continually walking past with no one checking why our drinks were empty or if we needed to order another course. Manager was floating around - not once did he stop at our table. To make it worse there appeared to be gathering of management team overlooking our table and no one noticed us continually having to call staff to our table. What a disappointment after such rave reviews. Certainly expected better
5
Really enjoyed the night. Got there early to have a cocktail outside and watch the Singapore sunset give way to the city night lights. Stunning.
Food was as always delicious and our server Rita was outstanding.
Highly recommend for a special occasion...expensive but worth it.
5
Felt so welcome from the door, beautiful window seat, friendly and kind team, delicious food.
What more can I ask :D
Thank you Ce La Vi !!
5
Had the tenderloin and sticky chicken. Both were delicious. The view up there is to die for and the service was great.
5
Ryan took great care of the 12 of us. He introduced the champagne for us to celebrate the year. And was attentive throughout the night. He made sure we ordered the right amount of food (not too much) and know when/how food will be served.We picked several starters to share. The sticky squid and the vegetarian salad stood out for me. The wine selection was superb. The Black Cod was soft and succulent flavoured subtly with miso. I should have listened to Ryan who suggested the broccoli for my sides.The jackfruit ice cream was very good.I plan to be back
4
Ce La Vi was located at level 57, Tower 3 of Marina Bay Sands. Have drinks here during tea time. Nice view with leisure seating. Variety drinks in the menu to let you order. For those who don't want to pay the sky park entrance fee, may consider have drinks here.
3
We went up to the restaurant to have dinner without reservation. So we went to sit at a table outside. Someone from the staff came to explain that we'd need a reservation (although the tablewas not booked)nd spend a minimum of 80 s$ per person. We had no issue with the limit per person but were sent away anyways since we 'had to reserve first'. So we did. Than we were not yet able to have a drink at the table since it was 20 minutes before 18:00 .... Since I was not feeling well I did not want to stand anymore. After some complaining we were finally allowed to sit at our table .... I understand many tourists come up and have just a drink and take some pictures. But if people agree to your terms for dinner why do you need to be so inflexible about when someone can sit at their table. Luckily afterwards we had a different waiter who was super friendly. About the food; we ordered all the sushi dishes on the menu and they were really good. For dessert we ordered the chef's selection which again was really nice.Had we been greeted and welcomed in a normal polite manner this would have been a great experience. Being customer minded instead of procedure minded can make all the difference
5
We ended our trip to Thailand and Singapore with a lunch at the Ce La Vi Restaurant as it also happened to be my husband's 56th birthday. I emailed and called the restaurant that morning and booked a table for 6 for lunch. Fabulous food, we opted for the set menu which was delicious and extremely filling. Cannot fault anything and they even presented my husband with a lovely little ice cream dessert complete with candles for him which was a lovely finish to our meal Our waiter Yul was extremely helpful and couldn't do enough for us, so many thanks to him! We would thoroughly recommend the restaurant and yes it was probably the most expensive meal we had whilst in Asia but when I compare what we pay in Scotland at a high class restaurant its still cheaper and the view was worth every penny!! If I ever return to Singapore would certainly book a table :
5
I made reservation for our office dinner for 9 people on 13 May 2016, requesting for a good view and we got a stunning view, long table with comfortable seating. The server, Rita was very friendly, knowledgeable and patient while taking our orders. She suggested and recommended dishes for us to share which were awesome ... Wok Fried Shishito Peppers, sashimi, black peper prawns, ribeye, grilled lamb ...and many more. We enjoyed the food and wine! The Manager, Sashi came by to make sure we were all good, recommended some dishes and let us know that we can go to the club after the dinner if we want to and we did! Overall, great experience and awesome service
5
I booked a reservation online and requested for a seat overlooking the marina bay. We got the desired seat and the view was beautiful!We ordered from the ala-carte menu. Loved the Pan Seared Foie Gras served with Unagi, and the Crusted Tuna from the mains. The service was pretty good with plates changed on every course and wine refilled without a wait.Had a memorable dinner and would come back again

We came here for our last night in Singapore, this is truly a special restaurant with outstanding views. You avoid having to pay the $30 charge per person to go to the observation deck which is one deck below just for a view. By coming to this restaurant you can have a special evening with very tasty modern asian fusion cuisine. Minimum spend is $80 per person (food and drinks) Expensive but worth it
5
The Sands concierge kindly booked us a last minute table so we could see the sunset view of the city, and Yul, our server, orchestrated the timing of our choices so we could clink glasses and graze as the sun set. Quite special.
3
Had a dinner there, was curious about the night view of the Singapore. View was great! Ordered a few appetizers and mains. I had salmon roasted, and was asking for a crispy skin of salmon which i believe they should be able to make it but came with a burn skin of salmon which is unpleasant (for that class of restaurant). Wine was great, but the service was average
5
Advised by our hotel conceige that if you had a drink in the Ce La Vie bar on the 57th floor you did not have to pay the fee to access the observation desk and it was a fabulous experience. The drinks are expensive at hotel prices but the atmosphere view and experience was spectacular and a special treat for our last night in Singapore
4
We had a great table as I booked ahead and asked for a nice view...I doubt there is a bad view! We had the tasting menu as it wasn't much more and it was very good. We had champagne which was on offer for 185sd Â£90ish, considering wine is expensive in Singapore this was a reasonable price. Defiantly recommend here for an occasion
1
Drinks are regular hotel prices, but there is nothing special, cest la vie offers very average 90's style plain drinks and really disappointing service. Every other restaurant and bar in MBS is great to exceptional, compared to Spago, the Skybar, Cut, and others this is awful. Been many times over the last few years with clients and family, only go if you want a nice view with poor service and watery drinks
5
We are generally tough critics of dining places since we are lucky enough to eat a lot a great food globally. That said, this place stacks up. We were being seated on the rooftop deck and didn't like our table so asked for a bigger one with a better view point. The hostess was great and took only a few minutes to confirm our preferred table. They had a delicious tasting menu featured, but, my partner and I like to share food and graze with appropriately paired beverages. We noticed that the Foie gras was on the tasting menu so we asked if we could have that as a starter and much to our delight they accommodated us. It was amazing. We also enjoyed some very nice cold sake with our many dishes recommended by their sommelier. Everything was quite delicious and the servers very attentive and nice. The view is amazing
4
Wanted to enjoy the last night of our holidays during our stopover in Singapore, a beautiful location to say the least. Only minor issues we had were the low level lighting at the dining tables requiring reading lamps on the menus and our location was a little too close the band making it hard to hear the waiter and to have a conversation. The modern asian fusion menu was great with plenty of options and overall we had a wonderful experience and was well worth
4
If you would like to see a nice view of Singapore whilst enjoying some good food in a romantic environment, then this is the right place for you. We went there in the evening and therefore could see the beauty of Singapore by night. The food is excellent and the service likewise. My only suggestion for improvement is to have more time between one dish and another as as soon as we finished the starters, the main courses arrived! We were sort of rushed into it because of the restaurant's availability. However, we still enjoyed our meal to the full and we definitely suggest you pay a visit to this romantic restaurant
5
Atmosphere here is brilliant, the drinks/ cocktails on offer is out of this world. Me and my husband have visited a few roof top bars around the world, this has to be our favourite. Unfortunately we didn't have food here as we were only in Singapore for 4 days so needed to see more around the city.
4
If you want to get to the top of the building with the boat you have three options. Get a room (super expensive, but you could go in the pool), pay to go to the observation deck (~$23 i think) or go to the bar (free to get up, but drinks were all ~$24). I wanted a drink up there anyway, so in my opinion, it was totally worth it. Of course the drink was over priced and weak, but I would still have rather paid the extra ~$1 difference. The view may have been better from the observation deck (I suspect you could see the super trees but I don't know for sure). But the view from the bar was pretty great (of the Bay). You could also see the pool (but not go in it). The view from Level 33 was slightly better, but only because you could see the boat building
4
Went up for an early mother's day celebration.
Food was average but ambiance was spectacular no matter how many times you may be there.
Will visit again for special occasions.
5
Went with a group but no issues.
$12/£8 for a tiger beer, great atmosphere, amazing views over Singapore, highly recommend a visit.
5
The evening spent at Ce La Vi for dinner with our friends was magical. It was a last minute idea as we were all about to fly home to the USA and Australia the following day, and I'm so glad we embraced the opportunity!The view, or course, is outstanding, a one-of-a-kind experience in Singapore. The open air restaurant (57 floors up) was breezy with a touch of humidity....seriously perfect. The service was excellent, attentive, friendly, professional. We selected the "all in" tasting menu and the four of us feasted on assorted fish, meats, fruit, vegetables and assorted drinks...all choreographed by the restaurant. While we rarely indulge like this, it was a night to remember, and I would do it all again on the next visit to S'pore
4
Last September was the previous visit... mediocre food then... BUT what a huge difference this time. Completely different, food was much improved and all dishes were good. It is still expensive, but you're paying for the view as well. I guess if I had one observation the deserts are the weakest... the chefs special is very expensive and honestly not worth the price... flavours are odd. Service also has had a total turnaround... great and the team were superb.. So without doubt worth a visit, prepare to spend $400 for a long evening for 2 people
3
The location and view is absolutely spectacular. What we didn't like was that after spending almost 2.000 SGD, we were not allowed to go out on the viewing Plattform. This area is protected by security personell. The Food itself was good but nothing extraordinary. We had expected more
5
Ce La Vi is as good as they claim to be on their website.... perhaps even just a tad better. Sensational views. Expensive dining, but hey they gotta pay the rent, and seriously their chef performs magic. If you have a serious date, or are celebrating an anniversery.... book a dinner here and you will build a memory
5
This place certainly has a vibe on a Saturday night, with lots of people coming up to see the view from high above Singapore. The food was very good, the service top notch and the atmosphere great. The drinks however were hugely expensive, with no bottle of wine under $110, even WA wines I know that retail for about $25-30...but maybe that's just Singapore, which doesn't seem to have bottle shops or byo..
4
This restaurant is on the top (the 57th floor) of Tower 3 of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. We visited on a grey cloudy night, our last in Singapore. As a result we did not get to see the sunset but it was still a very good place to go to celebrate the end of our holiday. The views both out to sea and over the City are amazing. Restaurant was very good - service was generally good and attentive. The food is very much Asian or with an Asian twist and was all well cooked. It is not especially cheap but good value given the surroundings. There is a minimum spend in the evening - although if you are having a meal, not just one course, this will not impact you
3
It's a very nice place but not upto the mark what one would expect a restaurant/lounge/skybar of this stature to be of. Service is slow and inefficient. Ambience is not that great if you are sitting inside the restaurant. Food is mediocre. I know lot of other places in Singapore which serve food better than this fine dine. Reservations are not smooth
5
We booked last minute and were still able to get a table outside where we could sit and eat and look over the city. The waitress was very helpful in explaining the theme of the restaurant and how to order food.The food itself was delicious!Overall, a good price for the whole deal - food, atmosphere, view
5
One of life's most memorable meals, not just the location but the food too. Attentive friendly staff. Fantastic food. Worth the money for a special occasion. Portions generous for sharing
5
Loved everything about this place. My waiter - Andrei was rather helpful and great. We had a great time enjoying the skyline of Singapore.
5
This place is flawless, we had lunch here and everyone's food was quite astounding. We did not expect it to be at such a high level, this combined with the service and location really blew us away.
3
I ordered a mojito as I'm a specialist (in drinking mojitos) found it really bad and totally overpriced. I told the waiter about it and immediately the barman came and asked me what's wrong. He did the whole thing again and it was nice. I would have put 0 stars for quality and 5 for service. That's why you will find average mark
5
I was dining for lunch at CÉ LA VI with a group of ten other people. The service we received from Lily our waitress was excellent, she was very knowledgeable, helpful, patient and polite as she moved around the table taking our orders and answering the never ending string of questions. We were all in Singapore for the Asian Pastry Cup which was held at the Food Hotel Asia Expo and are all very much involved in Patisserie. We all enjoyed the food very much especially the desserts which were faultless. Lily made our experience at CÉ LA VI a most memorable one and everyone in the party said how much they enjoyed it. Thank you so much Lily, the wonderful memories will stay with us forever
5
Great views, drinks and delicious food! The staff is also really awesome! Special customized drinks were created for us based on our individual choices of ingredients and taste... which were superb! The dinner was very delicious. They do take some time to serve the food though! Overall ...simply great
5
We celebrated my wife's birthday at Ce La Vi and enjoyed every moment of the night. We ordered the tasting menu, which represents a great tour through all the restaurant has to offer. Top-notch ingredients, well-prepared and served with aplomb. Full marks.What made our dinner rally special was the service. Rita was attentive, courteous and knowledgable, and did a great job introducing each course and ensuring that we were well taken care of. If I was the General Manager, I'd take the time to acknowledge such a dedicated staff member. Thanks Rita also for saving the day with a beautiful birthday cake/dessert without even being asked (yes, I wasn't as prepared as I should have been).We're about to move to Singapore, so Ce La Vi will be on our regular dining circuit. Good work from kitchen through to front-of-house
1
It was not easy to book this restaurant. It took 2 phone calls and 2 emails. They eventually replied to my 2nd email and insisted on my credit card details and please could I pre-order the food for my group of friends? This got my back up before we got there. When we arrived the restaurant was all but empty. We chose from the 3 course menu. We ordered a lovely bottle of wine and waited for our lunch. The soup arrived. Miso. It was bland and uninteresting. Next course, five mouthfuls of salmon on a large dinner plate, with no accompanying sauce or garnish, but it was was quite tasty. By this time I was really hungry. Main course arrived. Thai chicken. It was horrible. Whatever can you do to chicken to make it so unappetising and rubbery? Couldn't eat it. It didn't even look like chicken and had a texture of plastic. A friend ordered dessert and I tried some chocolate pudding which was lovely. The service was enthusiastic, but rather confused. The food was seriously bad and the menus need upgrading to something less pretentious and more wholesome. It was expensive, I get that we were paying for the view, but don't pretend to be a world class restaurant and charge a lot of money for terrible food. I was starving when I left there, a mark of a really bad dining experience
5
My husband and I were celebrating our honeymoon in Singapore and staying at the Marina Bay Sands so it made perfect sense to visit Ce La Vi in Tower 3 of the hotel. We did book a month in advance to ensure we got a table, whilst I would suggest a reservation is necessary I am not sure it would be required this far in advance for a Tuesday night.We were seated at a fabulous table in the restaurant next to the doors opening up and looking out to the bar, the whole ambience could not have been better. Wonderfully relaxed yet still chic, a perfect combination.We ordered a whole array of wonderful dishes, but by far the Wagyu Beef and the Black Cod Miso were the best. The wine and cocktails we had to accompany our meal were absolutely sublime. We were in no way rushed, our waitress was attentive but discrete and there is not one thing I would have changed. All in all a perfect first night in Singapore and definitely a restaurant I would visit again
5
The service was exceptional and very attentive. It is the perfect location for a nice meal or for an occasion in need of celebration. The food was brilliant and I encourage anyone to mix up the select of what they order, we ordered the tasting menu and it was fantastic.It terms of price, don't go here if you're on a budget. It is a premium restaurant but you pay for the service and quality of food you get
5
I been here for many times because of the food, the restaurant views and very helpful staffs. Rita can helping you to select the best food and advise some of the special from her restaurant.
5
I love this restaurant. The food is great and the view is even better. Service is good and the whole experience of eating outside a gazing at the view across Singapore is simply outstanding. Every visitor to Singapore should have dinner here at least once.
5
Rita provided brilliant service! She was not only very pleasant and attentive, she had the best recommendations and advice regarding what dishes we would find nice. Rita deserves recognition award for all that she does!
5
Perfect - don't waste $26 on the sky deck, go one extra floor & spend the same amount on a cocktail. Great drinks, food, atmosphere, service. Kudos to our waitress, Jess (from China) - so knowledgable, attentive & friendly.
5
It's always a 50/50 proposition when visiting a restaurant at a major tourist attraction, particularly in a country like Singapore. Will the restaurant be genuine and worthwhile or will it be tacky tourism dressed up as class?Ce La Vi, atop the impressive Marina Bay Sands towers, delivers genuine class with little effort. The views are fabulous as one would expect. I second a previous reviewer's advice - dispense with the Skydeck fees and enjoy drinks and snacks here in Ce La Vi. The food was a most pleasant surprise. Well cooked, very tasty and the perfect snack-size options to accompany well mixed drinks. It is expensive - let's not ignore the grand venue it is a part of. Don't expect cheap eats here but do expect pretty good value for your $.Staff were attentive and knew their game. A small piece of amusement when asking the staff where the oysters for the Irish Oysters came from. We were told "they come from Irish". Which, if true, is a really long way to ship/fly an oyster... Needless to say they were still delicious and did the trick, regardless of their country of origin!One small point - do watch out for the incessant selfie-takers who will insist upon ignoring diners to get that photo full of their own face and a little view... Narcissism is alive and well regardless of venue.Overall Ce La Vi is a place to visit and enjoy the panoramic views of Singapore in a relaxed environment with great drinks and food. Put it on your list and you won't be disappointed

If I went back again, I'd drink and have appetizers or small plates. The deep fried veggies, and the Peruvian marinated fish were great. My main dish of sesame-encrusted tuna, was uninspired. It was lovely to sit and watch the sun set, and I enjoyed it, but would not eat dinner again
5
I was very impressed with the black cod - I knew it's supposed to be good, yet that meal exceeded my expectations by far. Gorgeous view - a feast for the eyes indeed; a very nice service - thanks to Anderey for all the advice and cheerful attention to every detail.P.s a table outside for perfect for our dinner (we had +32 during the day, lovely warm yet fresh up there in the evening)P.p.s. A matcha/chocolate tart for a desert - highly recommended :
5
I spent a lot of time finding the right restaurant to celebrate my husband's birthday. And after reviewing many other places, I booked this one because of: the reviews talked about great food, fantastic views and helpful staff. Well let me tell you: everything is true!!! I had a lot of expectations since we were coming with my young son, we also have one member of the family with certain food intolerance and I still wanted a great table, great food and care for details. When we arrived, the staff knew all about our needs and was ready to help us out to make good selections. We order three starters that we shared and kept on ordering as we ate. My kids ate all since it was so yummy (included the broccoli!!) ...when kids broccoli, right? Well, it was that good. The waiter was so careful to guide us about the ingredients on the dishes, so every one had something tasty to eat. By the end, we ordered four desserts, all different, but all delicious! All along the dinner we got suggestions of drinks for our dishes. The thing is that we didn't think the staff was interrupting or bothering, they were there when we needed them. Needless to say the view was amazing! Yes, the bill was sassy but if you like good food and great service with a view, this place is for you
5
You don't need to pay the entrance fee to go to the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands! The view from there was amazing and the alcohol was very good. I had alcohol around 5pm and there were few people so I was able to enjoy the view. Wanna go there again for dinner next time
5
I had the opportunity to discover this little paradise and I was not disappointed!Upon my arrival, I immediately loved the place and its beautiful view.I was quickly taken over by a smiling, friendly and helpful server. His name was Francis. I remembered his name thanks to the TV series, Malcom :)He gave me a drink "Singapore Sling" and it was delicious. This server has the ability to put you at ease so that you spend a pleasant moment in this unusual place.I think my experience will not have been the same if the staff could not have been so available.Believe me, this place remains my favorite. Everything is gathered in one place: simplicity, usability and view breathtaking.In short, a must not to miss! What do you expect to fly and enjoy a nice Singapore Sling!
5
Beautiful place to have drinks. Bit pricey but worth the cash as great cocktails and gorgous views.
100% recomend to others
5
Need to be aware this place is full of prostitutes who do not ask to be paid... Be careful, can be very dangerous for men
4
Obviously you come here for the view and overall experience. Unfortunately the view of Singapore skyline is obstructed, only guests of the hotel can access a special viewing platform, which is a bit mean at these prices!
4
we went here for the cocktails and the view and were not disappointed at all. Though the cocktails are very expensive, the view is amazing!
4
This is a place to chill, listen to some good music, enjoy a drink or light meal. We had burgers and beers whilst appreciating the incredible view from deck 57 next to to the Sky Park. Not cheap, in fact expensive, but happy we experienced it whilst there
1
Food was dreadful, the service was shocking. At a minimum of $80 required per person for dinner you would think good quality food! No terrible food, after spending a huge some of money you will still need to go to MacDonalds for food. You will go hungry. And to top it off you have to witness all the hotel guests walking around in their towels and bathrobes, and I'm spending a fortune for an experience. Don't waste your money
4
The staffs was helpful and polite . I was feeling sick on that night during my visit . Unfortunately, the table we sat on was right under a air con which was not good for me . The reception staff gave me a scarf and when we were leaving she said its for me to keep it . The food was good
3
On a solo day in Singapore, decided to have a great view for lunch off to Ce la vi. The view was there. Always is. But the food.... Not to say that it was bad, far from that, just underwhelming. Was expecting a bit more that amuse bouche size portion. I mean one and a half scallop for main course !!! Flavours are good. Execution could be better. Luckily dessert is here to lift the experience up.
5
Wow!We had heard of the extraordinary view, but the whole experience was excellent.The view from late afternoon into the evening is unique, with the panorama of Singapore Harbour and the City itself just amazing.Then, to have a beautiful, tasty meal with excellent service just capped off the perfect day.Our waitress Elvira was most attentive and helpful. She is to be congratulated
2
Ce La Vi is a great place to go for a few drinks and enjoy the spectacular views of Singapore. The bartending staff were friendly, as was the host in front of the restaurant. Unfortunately, the wait staff inside the restaurant were horrible. We had a group of six guests, so we experienced three separate waiters. Unfriendly, couldn't remember orders, didn't listen to instructions, trouble splitting the bill. . . If I'm going to pay $30 SGD for a little salad, good service should come along with that price. The food was prepared well and presented nicely, but the bad restaurant service really brought down the entire experience
5
Our nth time in Sinagpore, but first time to try Ce La Vi. Amazed by the spectacular view complemented by the impeccable service of our mixologist/bartender Francis. Needless to say, the Berry Bellini and I would definitely see each other again very soon.
5
Drinks before the dinner were perfect.
Dinner itself full of pleasant surprises. View is fabulous. Atmosphere is great. It is a must in Singapore.
5
Excellent food and great service! Had the set menu lunch and everything was delicious.
Great views, would visited again.
5
Perched on top of the most iconic building in Singapore, Ce La Vi has a big reputation to live up to! The food is great, either the A La Carte or the tasting menu, the view absolutely stunning & the resident DJ does overlooking the restaurant does make this quite a unique experience.Getting a table at either edge of the restaurant that affords the great view is a biggie so beg & plead when booking for this
1
Used to be called Ku de ta. We decided to bring our grandparents for a great view on top of mbs hotel but to our dismay the restaurant seat didn't offer a good view as we were placed in the middle of the restaurant depsitr request and the food was overpriced.Food was horrible, the steak was just beef slices and the oyster was not fresh tasted fishy full of ammonia. Definitely not going to visit there again, for the similar view and much better ambience try Spago instead
5
Exclusive cocktail bar at the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Not be missed if you are a guest, it is easily accessible. Drinks while watching the day end is not to be missed. The view is breathtaking although humidity, most and cloud can at times detract from the outlook
4
First and foremost, the views from this place are spectacular. So are the prices. The service attempts to justify them but probably falls just short. My friend and I had the taster menu which was very pleasant, tasty and filling. Without going overboard with drinks the bill was S$280 each. Value, no. Worth it when in town, yes (but more for the location than what you get)
5
Coming to the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to check out the view and have a drink was on my bucket list in Singapore! Drinks aren't cheap, but that's standard in most places here. We had one drink at the bar and soaked in the view.The view is amazing, and well worth doing. There's also the Observation Deck to check out the view if u want to skip drinks
1
Joined up with friends who had been previously for cocktails at this much lauded venue on the top of Marina Bay Sands. Three cocktails and a beer ordered. Drinks came at various stages over a 25 minute period, so the first drinks were well watered down by the time we clinked glasses and said "Cheers!" The same could not be said for the bill, which was slammed down in its folder very smartly and checked relentlessly every two minutes to see whether a card or cash had been slipped in to the folder. Not how we expect to be treated and certainly not at these prices! Finished our drinks after paying the bill and complained to senior staff about the service. Frankly, the apology was grudging - their staffing issues are not the problem of their guests. Very embarrassing for our friends who had raved about it. Won't be back and would not recommend
5
The restaurant is situated on the Skydeck and the views are truly spectacular. We started off with cocktails in the Sky Bar and just took in the scenery for a while before moving in for dinner. The menu is varied with small serves of dishes so that you can order lots of different things to share and there is a good choice of drinks including some heavenly cocktails. We shared the pork bell, grilled prawn salad, sticky Thai chicken, spicy mushrooms and pan seared scallops - delicious! The service is excellent and our waiter was happy to give advice about what to order. It is expensive but well worth the cost
3
Book a reservation for drink in the bar & eat somewhere else. Food was on both the occasions we have eaten here arrived tepid in temperature. Spectacular view.
5
Can recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting authentic dining.
Service is great as is the food and wines available.
4
We had drinks here while waiting for our room to be ready. They offer a wide selection of cocktails. Drinks were very good- not too sweet and just the right amount of liquor. They have sofa/table seating. Views is awesome. Need a card to access this restaurant located on the 57th floor, pool level. Staff are friendly and attentive.
5
We had a reservation in the restaurant for 8 pm but had decided to spend an hour in the Sky bar before that. The bar was really lovely with very good music, ambiance (it was bustling) and of course the fabulous views over Singapore. They have some interesting cocktails, which we sampled. The restaurant itself, which is adjacent to the bar (but also has tables around the bar) was also pleasant, sharing the same music and views. There was a lovely breeze blowing both in the bar and the restaurant. The food was very, very good and we especially loved one of the desserts we had which was a Pandan Coconut Verrine. But really, we liked all the dishes and the service was good as was the wine selection.If I had anything to criticize I would just say that we were a bit surprised that when we asked to go to our table early, we discovered that we didn't actually have a table reserved and if we had taken a table at 7:30 PM we would have had to have left the restaurant by 9 PM. But, we loved our evening there
4
View is great so it's worth visiting, have a drink or two but be prepare to pay above average prices. Gin and tonic was pretty good, but then it should be for around $30 a glass.The bar at the top of Raffles Place is better
4
The view is as advertised - gotta go. Our salads (grilled prawn and crispy vegetable) were amazing. Entrees were mixed. My sticky Thai chicken I wouldn't recommend. Friend had beef tenderloin with bok choy and said it was one of the best he ever had! It was pricey but worth the trip. We went at dusk and saw the city and lights change before our eyes. The pictures are priceless. I recommend.
5
We made reservation when we first got into Singapore. We arrived early and went up and had a drink at the outside bar. Spectacular views. They we very good about letting us transfer our tab for drinks to the dinning table. You must spend at least $80 per person to dine in the restaurant. The food was very good. The warm salad was wonderful. Our waitress was great she made sure they had a table inside in case it started to rain. Very attentive. Really enjoyed it
1
Extremely expensive for the miniscule portions of what they consider fusion cuisine. Waiter in our section was attentive, but our request for more water from another waiter went ignored from start to end. Lighting was very poor, half the time we could not make out what we were eating. The light they gave to read the menu was brighter than the poor excuse of a lamp they have at each table. Atmosphere was zero. Will never go again
3
We visited this bar in lieu of doing the skypark because we figured we would get the same view for the same price and get a drink out of it. It was packed, so we didn't get a table by the edge. Not sure if they take reservations, but if so I would recommend. After taking pictures and admiring the view we found an internal standing table and decided to take a look at the cocktail menu. It took about 10 minutes to find someone to bring us a menu. Once we decided on our order, we waited 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us, and when no one did we left. The drink wasn't important to us, the view was. They could have had our business but missed out due to extremely slow service
2
Overall experience was mediocre. The view was great, and that was a given, but the food.. to me was just mediocre especially with that kind price (4 person at about $1000 exclude champagne pairing). BTW, i can't make out if I was eating Chinese or Japanese food and it was not much of a fusion cuisine either
5
Amazing view, excellent service, ambiance and food. For drinks or romantic dinner a must go place in Singapore!!!
5
The view is exceptional. The service in the restaurant is terrific, and the staff is helpful. The wine was excellent. The food was very good but not equal to the prices. I guess I expected more.
2
I'm on my honeymoon with my wife and i took her to dinner last night at Ce La Vi. We were expecting to have a delicious dinner, nice drinks and excellent service while enjoying the view. But none of the above came out the way we expected, except for the view. We are still very disapointed, because our check was preeeety expensive and the food was very bad, considering that we ordered almost all the starters. The waiter didn't had a nice attitude while taking out orders or while serving us, it was a bit uncomfortable also becuase he would make face gestures while we asked for suggestions on what to order.Overall the experience was good but don't go to the restaurant. Have dinner before, and go and have drinks
4
we had our CNY lunch there on the 2nd day of CNY.the view is fantastic, you have a bird eye view of southern part of SG.since it was CNY, we had the CNY set and the food were therefore related to CNY such as yusheng with fresh salmon / tuna etc, fresh oyster starter, kam shaped dessert.classy place, attentive staff, good food, nice vie
4
To go up to the 56th floor for the view cost $23 so one should head for the restaurant on the 57th floor and just pay for meal and drinks with the view not much different.Service and attentiveness of the waitress was great with drinks and food selection reasonable. You can choose to spend on drinks and a three course lunch or minimize on simple dishes and drinks. A prawn salad and Thai chicken were well received. Worth the experience
4
Went to ce la vi to celebrate a friend's birthday and watch the F1 night racing. The view was great! It's located right next to the infinity pool, so it's an even better complement to the skyline of marina bay. Chairs weren't very comfortable and average music but hey, food and drinks were great, so that made up for it
5
We requested a seat outside and they did there best on the night to give us it. We started our meal inside ordering drinks and then got taken outside, the view was spectacular. The food and service was amazing. I would recommend the black cod. They brought me over a birthday cake and made my night really special. My favourite night in Singapore
3
It fit the bill. Somewhere swanky and soulless to have drinks with colleagues after two long days of meetings. Just loud enough to not be able to hold meaningful work conversations, but soft enough to hear some of the drunker members of the group's bad jokes. Vapid service, overpriced drinks. In short - not much different from Ku De Ta.
5
Ce La Vi is located in the highest level of Marina Bay Sands. It just a small bar with a dance floor, and some quite places for relax or hangout with friends.My friends and I were trying to come this place in order to get "must see" scenery. The location near the outdoor swimming pool of Marina Bay Sands hotel, so you will find a lot of hotel guest.A really interesting place to escape from your routines with friends. I will come back to this place again. At last, you need to save every moment with a beautiful cityscape of Singapor

it's all about the place to be. nice view, Nice venue, you eat at the table, while at the central bar there are people having drinks. Food is expensive and not really amazing. You pay for the place i suppose. We were lucky to get a place outside, service was fair. i'd not reccomend eating here, since you can just have OVEREXPENSIVE drinks at the same bar!!

Had an unforgettable evening with my lovely family, celebrating our beloved daughter's 21st b'day! Ordered the set Tasting Menu for 6pax...we all went home as 6 belly-filled satisfied patrons😋😋😋😋😋😋Thanks to Ce La Vi for the attentive svc! Keep up the good job👍👍👍👍👍

In my opinion this place is overrated. The view from the terrace is amazing, but other than that I found it really superficial and average. There's no vibe to this place.
3
If you are going for the view then it's worth it but the food most definitely is not. It's a premium price for decent service and average food but nothing special
1
View are very nice. Service is ok! They just serve the food no follow up! Food was serve warm to cold. Menu stated baby squid but turns out a small slices of big squid. Roasted black cod over cooked. Food is not suitable for the very nice place
5
We went there 2 nights in a row and have nothing but good things to say. The service was impeccable, cocktails were great and the view was breathtaking. Expect to pay around SGD 30 for a cocktail and couple of hundred + for a bottle of champagne. There are 2 parts to the bar- the lounge/ club part and the restaurant part. Both are really nice but the lounge part tends to get busier. We were invited to a VIP area and staff made sure we were treated like VIP guests. Definitely my favorite bar in Singapore and probably one of my favorites in general
5
This is a great place to have a drink and enjoy the magnificent views of Singapore. Resident DJs are talented and know what to play to keep the dance floor occupied all the time. Food and drinks are expensive, but it's worth a visit if you want to enjoy the breathtaking views of the city. Attending this club and enjoying a drink is way better than paying a similar about to attend the Skypark just for the views as you can get similar views from this location
5
We booked a table due to the amazing views and recommendations.Our expectation was that the food and service would only be "ok and touristy".We were pleasantly surprised. Had the tasting menu and wine pairings. All very good and service was also friendly, caring and outstanding.Great views and interesting club lounge as well
3
So this visit was filled with ups and downs. The seating was not great but without a reservation I could not complain. The beef (rib eye) was excellent but their definition of medium rare was that on one side it was well done and the other rare. Excellent wasabi sauce though. After waiting for 20 minutes for dessert and coffee I find out the waitress I placed the order with went home without passing on the order to the kitchen. This was resolved with a complimentary extra dessert. Also the sugar bowl that came with the coffee contained ants
5
We came here with low expectations after reading the variable reviews. We were wowed. A long standing booking got us an outside table facing the garden. The service was superb from the minute we arrived.The food was also superb. We started with a fresh mozzorella and watermelon salad given a twist with pesto on the side. Delicious. Next came tempura prawns,simple on a bed of salad and foie gras with eel, yu jelly and pickled mango a wonderful combination. The main was roasted black cod, 2 pieces, moist, tender and tasty. We didnt need the chocolate fondue but it was delicious also. All shared plates, delivered at good intervals.All up, 3 entrees, a main and dessert, plus 4 glasses of wine. Sd 330. Not cheap but this is fine dining with a great view.After dinner we walked through the bar and viewed the city lights and roortop pool. Would recomen

 I was very sceptical about the experience at this place, I find restaurants with other main features like a location at to top of the building tend to lack on other qualities. This is not the case. The views are great and the food is even better. We had a full meal with starter main and dessert + a bottle of wine and water, the bill was aprox. S$ 400, and was worth the high price. The service started very poor, the waiter didn't seem to care much, luckily after a long wait he took our order and another person, seems an assistant took over our table and made her magic, if wasn't for this lady's great service we would have left with a very poor impression. She definitely saved the day.  Sashimi as a starter and the salmon and the tuna as the main course were the highlights of the meal.
3
You go to places like CE LA VI for celebrations.
The view from top is much better than what you see at Flyer but the food quality is average at best.
5
Exceptional views, great selection of drinks, really friendly staff who were very happy to help. A great way to enjoy the views and relax !
5
Fab experience, Elvira from Ukraine was our server and couldn't have been more helpful. Great view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands, and the fusion food was what we wanted .
3
Restaurant service was very average with no clear explanation of menu. Staff which were many were not attentive spending time talking to each other. Food was also average well presented but no wow flavours. Only recommend for the view.
4
Interesting modern Asian cuisine with a twist, plates to share with friends while enjoying the stunning view from the Skypark at MBS. Excellent wine recommendations to complement the food by Austrian Chef Sommelier Michael Leitner !
5
We had such a great night. The waiter was lovely she was very friendly and was very attentive. The food is Asian tapas share plates. All the food we tried was delicious. We tried the chocolate fondant for dessert, it was truly wonderful the best chocolate fondant I have ever had. Fantastic view from the restaurant of Singapore. It was great being there at night seeing all the lights
5
A great way to see the amazing view, have a drink and not have to wait in line (and not pay the ticket price) to access the skypark.Up on level 57, you'll get amazing views of the city, a slightly overpriced cocktail (not surprisingly really! And it was worth it!) and be joined by a fair few others - it was packed and we were there on a Tuesday night
5
Busy bar with good vibe and music. While this is a restaurant (which is the most of the upstairs area) came for a drink and the view. We managed to find a table looking right over the viewing deck of the skypark, it was exceptional and gave plenty of opportunity to take great nighttime photos.The Columbus cocktail was excellent, although a little expensive at $24 from memory, it's absolutely worthwhile given the location.Tip - if you received stamp downstairs be sure to wander through to bar area roped off ( to the left as walk out from the lift) as when you exit this area you get to see the gardens by the bay lit up at nighttime which is really pretty.
5
Unparalleled views from the 57th floor (bow of the boat) of the Marina Bay Sands. Delicious salmon sashimi, scallops and prawns featured in aromatic fusion sauces.Our server Zaf was delightful! Don't miss this once in a lifetime evening of fine food and stunning evening views of Gardens by the Bay super trees

I can't give it a minus, a shame. The location is amazing and the idea sound. The bar and drinks, although expensive, is a very good experience. The wine list is full of "for-show" stuff and lacks purpose other than to shock/brag/impress etc. Even a simple wine is poorly kept/served and overpriced. Sadly it falls further apart as soon as the food arrives. Our starter wasn't just bad, it was so bad I reached when I realised it wasn't actually cooked. Needless to say we drew a line and paid for what we had had and left. But not before meeting one of the worst F&B managers I've encountered anywhere in the world. A terrible sham of a floor supervisor who actually swore at us - yes really. Will we return for our 100 guest wedding anniversary - we were location scouting - of course not. Will we tell our friends, colleagues and readers (blog) about the place - of course we will. With the fairest review and warning we can muster. . .Go to the roof of your hotel, sip a drink, then throw a handful of Singapore Dollars in to the warm breeze every few minutes. Secure in the knowledge that at least you saved the cab fare. Or go to the Lighthouse rooftop bar at the fullerton across the water where they understand service and quality. Enjoy
4
Love the place and ambiance! The food also yummy but you have to spend S$ 2000 to have dinner here. And they have formal rule for dining here, so put your sandals at home.
5
The food was delicious, one of the best luxurious restaurant in singapore. Tried the Wagyu for 200gr and a bottle of chateau with friends. The fish, sushi, every food we oredered was perfect. 4 person cost like $800. So be prepared
4
I think the plus of this place is the view. It sits right on top of marina bay sands. I think the cocktails were ok but haven't tried the food before.
4
Nice ambiance and good food We ordered:Salted edemame (could be better)Sticky baby squid ( the best)Shrimp tempura, changed the sauce as it contains alcohol. (Good)For main course we had Steamed shrimp and Alaskan chili crab legs ( yummy)For dessert: we had matcha lava tart and chocolate fondue (so good 
5
I had lunch there, expecting to be just mediocre due to the area roof top is mainly full of tourists. However, I had the chef course and was happily suprised with the detail of the Dishes (courses) and the Flavors of each Dish. The service and the attention was outstanding as well.♡
5
We went here for a nice dinner date and ordered a few dishes. All that we tried are good to our tastebuds. Would definitely come back here when I go back to Sg soon. The service is very good and accommodating and friendly staffs, they'll make sure you're enjoying every food they serve. You can go outside to the bar have a few drinks while enjoying the magnificent view of Singapore atop of Marina Bay Sands Tower 3
5
Brought my boyfriend there for a surprise birthday dinner. We were greeted by really friendly staffs at the receiving area. Rita, the waitress who served us had been very informative and attentive, explaining to us of all the dishes we ordered. Keep up the good service! Had a very wonderful night at CE LA VI. Would definitely come back again.
3
The lift access to the restaurant was an horrendous experience for us. It went up to the Sky Park level (57th floor), before a lift attendant/crowd controller lady stopped the lift for the visitors to the Sky Park to descend back to 1st floor. We couldn't protest further when we saw the lift plunged back to first floor. We were already late for the reservation, and we wasted some time in the lift with such a bad customer service. Why can't the lift attendant on the Sky Park level let the guests who are dining at Ce La Vi to alight at 58th floor, before letting the visitors leave the building? I couldn't quite understand the urgency behind this matter. It has indeed left a bad experience for us. The price was the usual - exorbitant but we knew it was worth it for the kind of view we were greeted with while dining. Gorgeous night view! We ordered the taster set menu, and it left us feeling so bloated (the serving size was way too much for a taster menu). We didn't quite enjoyed the courses, but the dessert was so so awesome! Lovely table service we received throughout the dinner nonetheless
5
For our last meal of our 2 month trip we decided to go right to the top of this hotel for s meal with a view. We were not disappointed. Lunch was really lovely, small portions but really yummy. Staff were friendly, attentive and made the visit really special. Great location for lunch and definitely recommend
4
We booked ahead of time as I've heard it's hard to get tables. However sitting outside is not very pleasant as the winds are strong and the umbrellas flapping is noisy. We eventually moved indoors to enjoy our meal.None of the dishes dissapointed, the desserts were heavenly. Especially the pandan foam.A must do when in singapore. However you might end up spending $100 at least per person.
4
We visited Ce La Vi for lunch and tried at dinner, but dinner to just too busy. Our lunch for 5 of us was excellent. Great selection, great service and what a fabulous view!
4
Excellent venue, nice food, good wine list included a rose Ruinart which was a delight. Attentive and pleasant staff too. DJ was up close but not too loud, and I will certainly return next trip.
5
Rita was very zealous about her experience with us. She was so kind. Restaurant also has a wonderful view and prawn salad was brilliant. You should definetly live this unique experience.
3
This is a good place to show off Singapore to visiting friends or family. The Asian fusion food is ok although there are many places with better food and service. Bottom line, you pay for the view, and it's amazing. A few tips - come by cab to Tower 3. MBS car park can be a nightmare to get out of. Avoid the fatty pork belly lollypops. The Ceviche and swordfish roll is ok. Knappstein reisling is excellent and reasonably priced. You probably only need 2 or 3 mains if doing entre's and sharing. And check the bill for mistakes
3
Visit for a drink only. Great views and you don't have to pay to go to the top of Marina Bay Sands. There's 2 sides to the bar, one where you can see the much hyped rooftop pool and the other with views towards the Singapore Flyer
5
I am not a big reviewer but I do read reviews before visiting a venue.There was much negativity about Ce La Vi on here and in particular about the staff well I rebuke it as I found the staff to be more than accommodating indeed out waitress/tour guide Carly was a total marvel, she made the evening so enjoyable. The food was superb in the extreme. It was expensive but an experience such as this should not come cheaply. $16 for a Corona is one example.But even after all that it was cheaper than High Tea in the Tiffin Room at Raffles which is another must in Singapore. Those who leave negative reviews for Ce La Vi are just being grumpy negative Nellies
1
We agree with the previous review. The service was awful with the exception of Sithra Ram. Her knowledge of the dishes and food was extraordinary. She was a true foodie! Her happy and friendly personality also saved the night. Food wise it is over priced but the quality is comparable with similar types of fusion Asian restaurants. It was nothing extraordinary. Drink and wine prices were extortionate. There is simply no justification (not even the view) for those prices. Now for the service - that was simply disgraceful. Rude is putting it mildly. It was abrupt, pushy and insulting. My partner took a picture of the view and was tapped on the shoulder and asked to explain what she was doing there and did she have a booking. We too saw the wheelie bin pushed through the outdoor dining area. There was also a small dumpster too. That would never happen at Hutong in HK. We paid close to $500 for 2 people (in less than 2 hours) and the overall quality of the service (except for Sithra) was appalling. Mistakenly we decided to watch the light show from the lounge. Once in we were told that we could stand around for as long as we liked but only in the smoking area. The remainder of the lounge (in fact most of it) was sectioned off for " VIP members only". Overall Ce la Vie was a great disappointment and does not deserve to be considered or compared to a fine dining restaurant.

Family dinner with 23 year and 26 year old children visiting during Easter. We had been to the restaurant a month before and had great expectations. All were met and added to. Again too notch service and professional and friendly service with very attentive and appropriately distanced service staff. Fast paced delivery of the family style dishes which we so enjoyed. The sushi variants, the ceviche, the spicy salad, the food gras. Then the hot dishes - sirloin, steak, and a nice sesame encrusted tuna. 4 desserts - coconut panna was my favorite, the melon sorbet was very nice and the cheese cake good. I tried the Shibuya toast which had altogether a bit to bitter dark tastes. Needed vanilla ice cream or other to lighten up. All in all a wonderful meal and our food guides for the evening, Moree and Raj were perfect. Thank you. We will be back. The only negative part was the welcome at the reception which only showed attention to me the western male and saying welcome Sir, and showed no attention or friendliness to my French carribean wife nor my children. I'm hoping that this can be corrected - in the world I live all people are equally worth and a greeting of a party if people must be directed to all the guests and not solely to the oldest male. Similar half greeting was shown in the second station where all attention was on me. However at the table all service was current visavi female and male members. I would urge the supervisors to do a couple of sessions on greeting ceremonies. A simple welcome and a nice smile to all in the party goes a long way. I would have scored a 5 but this detail which means a lot pulls score to 4.

First off, know that this is not a wallet-friendly place, so be prepared to shell out couple hundreds for drinks & bites if you're staying a while (two of us ran a tab of SGD$400+ for just cocktails/wine (by the glass) & bar snacks). If you're there for the view and drinks, get there around 5-6pm for a standing table to watch day transition into night. The day we were there, it started drizzling shortly after, and the staff were kind enough to offer us a table with an umbrella even though we weren't having dinner. We later moved to the bar in the main dining room to experience the buzz and ambience. I tried several cocktails and am still dreaming about them to this day. Likewise, the delicious bar snacks. Very impressed by it all, and the surprisingly good service across the board. Can't wait to go back for the cocktails and a proper dinner. When I strike the lottery, that is
1
Food was average and very disappointing. Service was appalling even rude, mains bought before we finished eating entrÃ©e, outside seating Ok for view but not comfortable, the garbage wheelie-bin being wheeled by our table while we were eating was disgusting - we paid $130@ for a very poor experience. it's not the prices that keep the restaurant 75% empty but the terrible service and average food. Better off paying just for viewing deck - which isn't included in the restaurant
5
The most amazing restaurant with the most amazing views.
Top service from the lovely Rohana Harris.... A huge thank you. . The food and service was fabulous and the view to die for. A must when visiting Sing
3
Yes, food is very good, but sitting outside, it gets hot very quick, too - which is not good for carpaccios and sashimis. Also, the champagne was served too hot, so not ideal. And the waitress asked why not ordering a whole bottle... very charming... This place is a cash machine in the first place. Go to Wolfgang Puck better or to Sky 57. Get a drink outside Ce La Vie's bar before or after dinner to enjoy the view, no need to have a super overpriced dinner there.But if you have the money and ant to spend it, you will surely enjoy
4
The view from the top of Marina Bay Sands is divine ! The skyline of Singapore, the business Bay, Esplanade, the parliament ... Beautiful It's better to go to the restaurant and have a drink and chill out than to pay money to visit the viewing area.The have limited tables so go early to have a good view. One can view the infinity pool in the clouds... From at a distance 
4
Booked Ce La Vi a few months prior to our visit and let them know we were celebrating a special anniversary. We did the tasting menu and the food was definitely exquisite-compliments to the chef. Our waitress was also exceptional. It was a very expensive evening for us. My disappointment was where we were seated - firstly to the side by a wall and when we asked to be moved we were moved to the back of the room where only one of us were facing out. Disappointed because the main attraction with this restaurant is the view. We asked to sit outside to enjoy our desert which we were accommodated for. In hindsight I would recommend going to another better valued restaurant for dinner and going to the Sky bar for drinks after to soak in the view, which is breathtaking I might add, unless you can be guaranteed a window seat
4
At the 57th floor of the 3rd tower of the Marina Bay Sands, this very popular restaurant and bar attracts a very mixed crowd. Good Asian food, great service, especially considering the busy evening. There was a DJ playing, there was good vibe.The views are amazing (of course being outdoors on 57th floor!). Bring a scarf, it can be very windy there :-
4
Want to see Singapore from the top we bought the diner in that restaurant ,food expensive and quite average,we have a banquet menu cost $168 Singaporean dollars each probably best not to choose this option,there is more cheaper choices but you must spent at least $80 each to go to this Ce La Vi restaurant
2
walk thru marina bay sands and decide to have an outstanding dinnerso we made a booking for 2 for 7pmafter going to the restaurant.. was escorted to the corner where it is not very convinience to enjoy the dinner and the viewthen we discuss few times with waiter and he mentioned few table already booked 3 weeks in advance.. but we saw so many table emptyso we decide to move inside.. but the same scenario was assign in the main aisle where all the waiters will pass byand finally we decide to cxl and find other placesit could be better we believesuch a great place but feel pit
1
The main reason that you eat in a restaurant is to have a tasty, well presented meal. The food that was served to my husband and I was terrible. The meat was chewy, the portions were small and the whole dish was over salted on both meals. We gave feedback to our waiter after our starter and then again after our main course. He was dismissive and shrugged off our complaints. We could not wait to leave and wouldn't have asked for a dessert if we had been dying of hunger.The ambience was more suitable to a night club than a restaurant as the noise was painful to the ears, people were shouting to be heard above the deafening music and the lighting was dark with spotlights that pierced into your line of vision and made you want to put on your sunglasses. To top it all, the food was really expensive and we wished that we had not bothered to make the trip up in the lift
4
Classy restaurant with spectacular 60th floor views at the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel.Asian fusion food, beautifully presented with excellent service. Pricey as you'd expect and portions are small. Good wine list and large bar area for before and after the meal.Take a wrap and don't bother to get your hair done as can be very breezy up there! Quite an experience!
2
We made the mistake of booking a 12pm weekend lunch with Ce La Vi on the phone, but what we not informed was that the skypark would also open then... in practical terms there is a massive queue for the lifts to accommodate both the people visiting the skypark and restaurant. We had to wait 30 mins to get to the restaurant, arriving 35 mins after the start of our initial reservation. Have eaten in this restaurant several times and when things are going smoothly, the food and service is exceptional; however, in the past 6 months the standards have been slipping and the staff are perhaps not able to accommodate the number of guests or perhaps as noted in the title, the standards are slipping. I don't think that I will be going back to Ce La Vi soon, as there other other options in the area, including Spago
3
The food was ok, and the atmosphere was not as expected being on the top of the hotel. The price was the most disappointing part of the evening.
4
Great location! Thats where i could stop. Service is bad as they just want you to order your drink and move on . Drinks are overpriced. Go there once for the LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION and VIEW VIEWS VIEWS. Bar needs a renovation !
5
What brilliant food to match the views. The staff were very helpful in assisting us with food to meet our dietary needs and the flavors were impressive. We were there for our anniversary and the experience was perfect for the occasion. The drinks were a bit pricey, but overall it was a value for money evening
3
Place was great, view was spectacular. Service and professionalism fell way short considering prices.went for dinner (party of 6) and was told table allocation was only when we arrived and so could not book any particular table. However, when we arrived was told the table outdoor with best view was reserved. this was totally opposite of what we were told when we called reservations.the worst part was even when we had finished dinner, the table we wanted was vacant. this spoilt the mood of my guests and what would have been a great experience. disappointed.service was also pretty slow and servers were not empowered with information beyond what is already on menu. it was a case of many 'let me check with the bartender
4
First, you need to find a concierge, which will take your name and will advise how to get to the Se La Vi bar on the top of the building Nr3 at Marina Bay Sands. Ask instantly to go to Se La Vi, while there are also viewing platform one floor lover, where you need to pay admission fee, but don't have drinks.as soon as you will get to the top floor, than breathtaking views will be revealed. Don't forget to grab a drink, even they come in a high price! enjoy the moments and the views!you also can have a meal in the bar or grill bar, which facing Marina Bay Sands infinity pool on the top of building Nr 1 and Nr 2
5
Really enjoyed our visit to Ce La Vi, from the moment we arrived ( with no reservation ) we were given a warm welcome and shown to our table.Carly talked us through the menu and was really helpful and informative.Food was beautifully presented and tasted wonderful. Cooked to perfection. Service was fast.Loved the relaxed atmosphere and of course the views are amazing.Pleasantly surprised at the prices, not cheap but we'll worth it for this standard of restaurant.Would highly recommend a visit
3
Given the overwhelming food and view hype and expectations--I was not impressed. Move the venue to street level in any major city and you'd walk pass The food was tasty and unique but the service was slow It's been awhile since I've seen a menu warning that a $80 SGD min per person existed in all parties. The night view of Singapore Malaysia and Indonesia was outstanding. However food and bar patrons are restricted from entering the hotel guest walk around the perimeter. Nevertheless photo op was terrificI doubt if I'd go back
4
The view is AMAZING from the bar at the Ce La Vi! There is a per person spending minimum and it is expensive. The food was very good, but I am not certain that it was as good as the price was high. The portions are small, like tapas, but our group enjoyed the experience. Singapore is a city of many, many wonderful eateries...I think you could enjoy the view from the lesser expensive observatory a floor below
4
Service aside, CE LA VI in Singapore is a 5-star experience from the breathtaking panoramic view, amazing cocktails, yummy food with a diverse variety of options (both indulgent and healthy choices) at expectable prices. However, the service (as with most places in Singapore) is very subpar, which officially makes it only a 4-star and even overpriced. Fix the service and the end to end experience would be tough to beat..
5
The view on top of the building at 57 floor is fantastic. The service is outstanding. Observant waiters who are professional. The food is amazing. Western and Asian cuisine at its best. The only thing I didn't like was the techno music at a to high volume
5
From the service, food, view to drinks, everything is really out of the world.
You will not be disappointed.
I hope to return very soon.
5
Food, service and view outstanding. Wine was great, steak was delicious and we enjoyed every second. Very romantic and classy - would definitely return.
5
Amazing view and service! Rita took great care of us. Took a lot of pictures and made it a special night. I'd love to go back.

After a pleasant time around the Gardens at the Bay it was time to head up to Ce La Vi for dinner. When we were directed to an internal mid-room table, we requested to be seated outside and were soon settled as the two sole occupants of a table for six. Whilst it was a little windy, it was a very pleasant temperature and much better to be outside ‘at the top’ of the Sands.Our waitress, Ara, was excellent as was the food. We shared two appetisers Spicy Sashimi Salad (Salmon, tuna, whitefish, crab, light spicy ponzu, sesame seed) and Salmon Sashimi with Shishito dressing, mizuna, uni powder which were delicious. I chose Seared Maguro Tuna Steak with buckwheat, cucumber, tosaka, and chive and Scott chose Grilled Rack of Lamb with pickled shimeji, pea shoot, walnut jus.There is a dining restriction that all patrons must spend a minimum of S$80 each. If you are having any drinks or a bottle of wine with your meal it is not hard to soon reach that lower limit. It was, however, an excellent meal.The main downside to the restaurant is that the dining area is within a perimeter wall allowing people visiting the bar for drinks or simply sightseeing to use the outer area with the main views. We felt it should be the diners who actually had the outside area and the views. We do understand, however, that this restaurant will be undergoing renovations later this year and so hope some seating changes are incorporated.Recommended for a delicious meal in a great location
5
Superb food served by Lily who was informative, attentive and funny! Another fantastic experience at this wonderful restauran
5
My husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner. Our waitress, Rita, was a delight and made our night with her bubbly, helpful personality and smile. The food was great (I recommend the crispy squid) and the view of the lightshow from Gardens by the Bay was beautiful.
3
On top of the Marina bay sands hotel can you enjoy an amazing view and both a light meal and drinks. We had some coffe and a drink nothing special but you pay a lot for beeing up in this fantastic place. You can see the hole city from above which is a wonderfull experience

It was a birthday lunch on a Sunday, so dress code was more relaxed! (Dress code to be Stylish chic 5.30pm onwards) Service: Waitress greeted us and gave a few recommendations, service was always with a smile. Brought out main courses only after our appetizers were finished and at the right time too. Food: For the starters: The truffled prawn salad (can't remember the exact name) was unexpectedly savoury and good! The Spicy Tuna roll was kind of on the same par as other Jap restaurants around. We had beef ribeye and black pepper seared salmon, both were tender and the salmon was thick, and melts in the mouth. Bill came up to about $180+, I would say it's worth it for a special lunch with a great view. Came with low expectations due to mixed reviews, but Ce La Vi totally won me over. Tip: If you're only going there for a drink/snack: Only sit outdoors if the weather is good! The indoors and outdoors seating operate payment settlement differently. If the sky is turning cloudy the staff will cover up the outdoor seats and may advise you to head to another section nearer to the infinity pool instead of heading inside. (I prefer views at the original seating!
3
We went to the restaurant to have a drink/coffees. This does not give you full access to the top level. Only the restaurant, but the views are still good. We unfortunately had it start to rain while there. They quickly packed up arount us, made us pay the bill, then sent us to the bar, which has access to the pool. Unfortunately, they were extremely rude and told us we had to stand at a table, even though seats were available. They also basically accused us of having our coffees when we had not even received. It took over 40 minutes to actually get the coffee we had prepaid. Totally felt like criminals. Will not recommend at all
5
We celebrated our 32 Wedding anniversary at Ce La Vi and couldn't have done better. The restaurant obviously has a sensational view and the staff were extremely attentive especially our waiter Ryan who did an outstanding job with suggestions with ordering and a very special anniversary dessert. The food was amazing especially the scallops. Will thoroughly recommend it to all our friends traveling to Singapore
5
Great view and fantastic food. The staff made it fantastic - really catered to our party and made the experience really stand out as much as the view.
5
We chose the surprise menu, with all courses, and indeed it was a big surprise. It was a Asian-Western fusion kitchen, with a nice combination of flavours.The presentations look like a painting, all high quality.Of course a good dish has its price.The wine was excellent and matching with the dishes.The staff was well organized, attent, but not dominant present,like you would expect at a Michelin-star restaurant.The waiting time between the courses was short.The view was excellent, and sunset time.We decided to eat inside, because of the wind.It was the best dinner we had in years.One small negative point:The reservation was for 2 hours, and in the end we ran out of time.In the Netherlands we are use to chat a little after diner with a drink,but there was no time anymore.To be honest, It didn't spoil the evening at all
5
Service, food, view, drinks outstanding. Get there before sunset and have a drink at the bar. You will not be disappointed
5
What a beatiful day spent at the Marina Bay Sands, tasting a worderful wine and eating execellent asian cousine, all mixed perfectly with a fantastic view of Singapore city and amazing friendship. Sithra was our waitress and she is amazing, offering the best of herself advising us always in good way about what to taste for an unforgettable afternoon on top of the worldThank you Sithr

We found trying to pre-book a table a complete pain. Dreadful web booking engine and a 28 day limit on advanced bookings.This was the only restaurant on our asian tour where we gave up and asked the Concierce at Fullerton Bay Hotel to book for us - which they did super efficiently.On arrival we were very underwhelmed by the decor and setting, except of course for the very glam singaporean FOH staff!! Low-tech furnishings and table settings, no tablecloths, average food and overpriced wines.The restaurant is surrounded on two sides by the MBS pay-to-view observation deck. Access to this deck NOT included in the substantial cost of a Ce La Vie meal and its presence means that the restaurant is part surrounded by hordes of people.The outdoor restaurant is poorly protected from the wind at that height, so take a hat, coat and scarf for dining in the evening. The best wind-protected outside tables may be those facing the sea and are happily on the side away from the pay-to-view observation deck.The small indoor eating area appears even more worn and less luxurious with no view; so perhaps defeats the main object of going.We've been once and will not be going again. Better food and arguably better views from window tables at Stellar restaurant 62nd floor at 1-Altitude

We went to CeLaVi a few times.The food, the service and the drinks are on a high level.We enjoyed a perfect wine recommendation by Michael. We got the chance to try several different glasses of wine. When Junaid was at our table, it was like beeing at a friends place!Thank you for the great time and see you hopefully soon!Cheer

My hopes were higher when I booked a table from this 57th floor restaurant. It felt that there was only one waitress (dark woman who spoke with quiet voice) who was really taking care of us, others were avoiding eye contact and serving our table. We were also said that food is ready in 5-10 minutes (?) and going out was not possible. We waited our food at least 40 minutes. Getting the dessert menu lasted too long and the end of our dinner no one even cared us. Too bad because I was having so high hopes about this place. Maybe we had the reservation too early (at 6 p.m) to get the best service.Three stars because overall experience would have been 8/10 if we were in normal Boat Quay restaurant. This 500$ experience would have been better with caring staff... Points from the view. Still I will try this place sometimes again

I thought it was just another restaurant, I was wrong the food, the people, and the views. Looking around me you could see smiling faces everywhere and the staffs we had Carly Lazaro they were well picked and trained by good managers. That's what I call service. One thing more they don't take tips so forget about it

Had a great seat by the window so the views were amazing, was a shame that it was raining so was quite misty.The menu is a mixture of western/Asian and though looked good on paper, was ok in reality. If it had been on the ground floor one would have thought it was overpriced, you are paying for the view.We found the service quite slow, ordered wine, but had to ask them 2 times to come and refill our glasses, so not very observant as one would expect from a place like this.Saying this, though overpriced for the food that is served I would still say go at least once, but expect to pay Â£100 per person including wine and drinks. If no drinks, quite a lot cheaper :

Marina Bay Sands hotel is an iconic building and Ce La Vi on the rooftop. Great ambiance. Sat outdoor with superb view of the Marina and the business district. We ordered most of the vegetarian dishes on the menu and each one was delicious. The chocolate desert was extra special. .
5
This is a fantastic venue for any occasion. View is brilliant and wait staff helpful, friendly and knowledgable. Thankyou to Zaf for my birthday surprise dessert and her friendly manner. Also thanks Rachel for one of the better outside tables in the restaurant.
5
We only had drinks they were great but did take some time to get them the waiters were not that efficient or friendly they are lucky to have such a fantastic view otherwise not much going for it
4
We asked for a table outside and we got a stunning view over the Gardens by the bay and Singapore Flyer. It was magic! Some of the dishes we loved and other not as good. But excellent service. The three course meny for two with a bottle of wine was about 350SGD
5
Once again we have been at Ce La Vi, and again we enjoyed our stay. And again Michael Leitner, the chief Sommelier took special care of us. Perfect pairing for everything we asked for!Thanks a lot Michael and team

Went to the restaurant for our wedding anniversary dinner. Nice location and view but was quite windy the night we were there.The foods were nice but quite costly. The foods and drinks were served to us at a reasonable time even though the restaurant were quite crowded. The food portion were about right-not too much or too little.Lighting was about right, we were allocated to the table inside the restaurant. I believe you can opt to have table outdoor. The restaurant is quite noisy hence might not as suitable for people who is prefer quiet meal

We had dinner at this restaurant with the family (we reserved a table for 4)during our stay in Singapore in August.The food was first class, the staff very attentive.The cocktails weren´t as good (we had some cocktails at the Ruffles bar the day before, and there was no comparison ) but still ok.The view was amazing, but i have to say I was very surprised as a guest not to be allowed to go to the view zone without paying an extra fee – we paid a few hundred Euros for dinner after all, and I think we should be allowed to enjoy the view from a nicer standpoint if we wish to without being charged. On top of that the amount of time you can spend at the table is limited to I think two hours if I am not wrong. We did dine within this time, but as soon as the time was up we were asked to move to the cocktail lounge so that the next guests could sit. I know lot of restaurants do this, but I am not a big fan of this. Overall I can recommend the salmon and you should tell the waiter to let the chef mix a starters platter for you, definitely worth it
5
My brother and I went to Ce La Vi to celebrate my birthday and we're certainly not disappointed. A huge thank you to Leo the guest devices manager for the outstanding service! Drinks and food were fantastic but nothing, not even the view of the pool, could out do the view of Singapore at sunset. Highly recommend the Sunday afternoon drinks. We will be bac

Attentive staff, wonderful menu and Million dollar views! Highly recommended (though the price may deter some). My wife and I came here for dinner for our 25th wedding anniversary. We loved every moment. Though we arrived 30 minutes late (something that would often turn wait staff against you) the staff enthusiastically greeted us. They upgraded us to a table with a spectacular view and proceeded to treat us as if we were the only people in the restaurant. The food as divine - every dish was a hit (all dishes designed for sharing). A truly memorable evening. My only tip - don't spend the evening looking down at your phones. Look out at the view, enjoy the surroundings and take in the entire experience (unlike the couple on the next table)..

If you don't want to pay the Sky Park prices and run a loop around the Observatory deck, you could come here instead for a drink, bite, AND the same view. (Granted, you are not at the edge of the deck looking into the water and immediate buildings below but you'd still get the same panorama.)My two Swedish acquaintances and I decided to enjoy a cool beer with the view, and this place was the ticket. There was a generous serving of Stella Artois which we enjoyed chilled while taking pictures of the view and lounging on the sofas under a large umbrella, escaping the worst of the sun. Definitely a better deal than the Sky Park, and a more comfortable one too

Me and my husband had dinner in CE LA VI yesterday.. The view is fantastic, food was GREAT and the most amazing is the lady who looked after us .. Her name is Jess and she's so friendly and sweet .. Maybe she's the sweetest person we have ever met .. I recommend you to visit this place for dinner or at least drink .. We LOVED everything there ..
5
When in Singapore, this is a MUST. The view in unlike any other in the world. The restaurant is well done and the staff is amazing. In order to compliment the view, the food must be excellent and this restaurant does not disappoint.

Great view, great drinks, great food, great ambiance, great view, great fireworks - an enjoyable Saturday evening.
5
Me and my girlfriend visited CÃ© la vi on our last night in Singapore. The food was amazing and dessert was breath taking. I would recommend that everyone have a stop over while your in Singapore. It is pricey but worth it (minimum of $80 pp). We had a lovely lady called Rita looking after us and recommend asking for her to serve you with a big smile
5
Been there just recently for dinner and drinks. I must say that was one of my best experience I had in Singapur for a while. I have to thanks especially the Head Sommelier Michael Leitner for his wine recommendations and high quality of service. It was the highlight of our evening.I will be back soon. Thank you
5
We had a meal here on Saturday evening . We had a great table with an amazing view over the flyer and the fireworks. A small problem was very quickly sorted out by Jumaith who was marvellous and the service was excellent . An evening to remember .
5
Top notch food, excellent services, special thanks to Jess, and the panoramic view of Singapore from the top of Marina Sands. We had the SG$48++ lunch, sounds expensive, however, it will cost you SG$23 just to get to the viewing platform, this is not bad and the food is actually good. Highly recommended
5
We celebrated our wedding anniversary on 22.02.2016. As per requested everything was on point. Our seating with the breath taking view,the food and my special request for the anniversary cake. Special thanks to the staff Michelle for your excellent service and helping with the plan :

We had dinner at Ce la Vi last night.The view is nothing short of spectacular.We elected to sit outside - the temperature was perfect - the occasional gust of wind didn't bother us at all.We had the tasting platter set menu and matching wine menu.The food was to die for - and unlike most degustation menus - the serves were generous. The sommelier kindly agreed to substitute some selections ( I don't like red or sticky). All of the wines were excellent.The service was attentive but unobtrusive.It cost us $730 Sing for 2 - we knew it was going to be super expensive. We loved it and would recommend it - for a very special occasion or a one-off travel experience.

I was disappointed here for a few reasons...the view from our indoor seat was non-existent - if you're going to pay premium prices for a view - it would be nice to have at least seen it! The food was very good - but not particularly creative - pretty standard japanese fair. I had the hamachi with truffle which was great and the miso halibut was very well prepared and tasty - but is similar to many other restaraunt offerings. The service was so so - quite amateurish which is surprising for a high end place.What I really disliked was the whole set up where you can dine - pay exorbitant prices - but you don't get to to the observatory area (it's for hotel guests only). I can understand the restaurant not wanting to crowd the place with people buying one drink - but if you spend a few hundred for dinner, I think it's worthy of the observation deck. I ordered a glass of brandy ($40 SG !) and I received the smallest serving of brandy I could have imagined.If it's the view you're after - try the Equinox on the 72nd floor of the Swissotel Stamford -- the service there wasn't much better - but the view from all dining tables was superb and far exceeded this view. I posted a review there a few days ago
5
I was invited to dinner here by a business associate so I can't comment on the value for money as he chose the menu and paid the bill but I can definitely comment on the quality of the food, beverages and service as this was one of the most fantastic evenings I can remember!The venue is nothing short of spectacular, perched on the very end of the very top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel looking down on pretty much everything. A dinner reservation gets you access to the bar on the viewing level so make sure you leave time to enjoy the views before heading into the restaurant.Every morsel of food we ate was perfectly cooked and delicious from the oysters to the crispy squid to the sushi and satay. Our host requested magnums of shiraz which were smooth and tasty.The service was cool (in a good way), discreet and professional, and the ambiance of the restaurant was chic and sophisticated.Every one of us had an incredible evening and I would absolutely love to return one day
5
We celebrated our Valentines day here. Great food & excellent service! Kudos to Marycel for attending us on this special Day. Keep it up!!
5
We had a wonderful dinner at this restaurant with an amazing view of the city. By eating here we avoided paying the $28 to go to the top of the Marina Bay Sands. The food was Asian fusion and excellent.
5
We were visiting Gardens by the Bay on holiday when we called here for lunch. It was so good we rebooked for dinner later that week. The restaurant sits at the top (57th floor) of the Skypark with fantastic views of both the coast and the city. The menu was amazing and our host Rita was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. The night view from this restaurant is also fantastic. I thought the grilled halibut and the chocolate fondant were particularly good and a lot of their dishes are designed for sharing. The chef Frederick Faucheaux took the trouble to come and meet us and in my view his cuisine is a good as any michelin starred restaurant that we have dined at
5
My husband and I went there last Valentine's day. It is a perfect place to celebrate,And overlooking the singapore skyline.Great food and very nice ambience.The staff are very nice, special mention to Marycel she is very attentive and accommodating to us..looking forward to visit Ce La Vi the soonest.
5
We booked a last minute lunch here during a 48hr stop over in Singapore - and what a brilliant choice that was!Save the 20S$ fee for the observation deck and come here instead, the views are just as good (you can't access the observation deck but the bar has one full end of the 'ship' so you can see in almost every direction anyway)The food is top notch, definitely try their famous tempura squid & we also loved the salmon sashimi, pork belly lolipops and aubergine dishes. Get a few smaller things to share so you can try more - it's all good!I half expected the service to be a bit average as you might think of a touristy type spot but this is certainly not the case here! From the friendly welcome to the knowledgeable and attentive service from our waitress Rita, we had a wonderful time and would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant!
5
The fact that this restaurant in on the top of Marina Bay Tower 3 speaks for itself! Breathtaking view, just next to the notorious swimming pool, is the best benefit!Tip: You will pay the same price for a beer at Ce La Vi Restaurant like the entrance fee for the Skypark downstairs. So It's much better to pay for drink + view, instead just a fee for the view
5
Was there on the 16th of feb. for a birthday celebration. Fantastic culinary experience, great view on the 57th floor of this fabolous hotel. Food was delicious, service was excellent. We have been taken care of Rita who was spotless, really amazing looking into everything. Well done, exceptional dinner
2
Staff from the ground floor till the waiters upstairs were more concerned about looking and accosting wayward tourists who are taking pictures. Service was ok. Food disappointing, the chef must be on vacation
5
We recently had our anniversary dinner there. They gave us the best table to enjoy the moment. We tried some new dishes and undoubtedly it was one of the best dinner I had in Singapore. The lady, SITHRA, was very helpful, knowledgeable of the menu and was a great help in choosing and serving us the great food.Would definitely recommend
5
To start, dining at Ce La Vi will be the most unforgettable experience we had. We went there last 15 Feb 2016 ~yes, day after Valentines day, and later on I will tell you why . 15 Feb is the birthday of my then was my girlfriend and now my FiancÃ©e. The perfect date to pop the question! Like most of the great boyfriends out there, I would like my proposal to be perfect and unforgettable. Thus, finding the perfect place is very important. I have tried to call several restaurant last 14 Feb 2016 as suggested by my friends, but since it's considered a last minute one, I got a lot of 'sorry we are already fully booked for tomorrow' type of response. Then, I came across to Ce La Vi while searching for places at Tripadvisor - so I called their Hotline (66887688). I was very grateful that the staff allowed me to have a last minute reservation for 2 after telling her that I was planning to propose to my Girlfriend. They even offered a surprise cake! All is set! My reservation was for 8:15pm, but we got a little excited so we arrived Marina Bay Sands Tower 3 at 7:45pm. Upon entering the building, we immediately saw the Ce La Vi entrance at the right. I mentioned my reservation and the staff politely ushered us to the elevator leading to 57th Floor. So we go up and up!Upon reaching the restaurant 200ft above sea level, we were stunned by it's beauty. We were greeted politely by all the staff and offered us 'the best spot' which is outside with a great 360 view of the City! And then we sat. We started with a glass of champagne, it was nice. Then, we ordered from their menu. I won't go pretty much to all the details about the food but to sum it up, the food was very very delicious! While eating our food, I sneaked out to talk to the person attending out table. He already new what I have in mind! My plan was to give her a small box to make her expect that it is the ring, but what's inside is really a necklace. This will make her a bit disappointed and will give her a clear message that I was not going to propose to her. A perfect start for my surprise. Then I'm supposed to go to her back and put the necklace to her... Once finished, she will turn towards me and see me kneeling down with a ring - and then they suggested for them to come with a cake that say 'will you marry me?' And that's it! So the time has come that we've finished our main course and got the hint that the cake dessert is ready, I then gave her the tiny box as planned and put it to her. Once they saw me kneeling down, three of the staff came. One was Leo (i think the manager or supervisor) he was happily cheering, then Zac was the one holding the cake with a little fireworks candle, and Maricel holding my phone and taking a video of our special moment. Things happened unbelievably fast and at the same time it feels like in a slowmo!! I popped the questions, she was surprised and she said Yes!!! :) the plan was a success. Special thanks to Leo, Zac, and Maricel.If you ever have any occasions, and any special celebration. Ce La Vi is the place to be. Look for Zac, Leo, and Maricel - they will assist you and their service is very very excellent! they are very attentive all through out the night and you can feel that their energy level was so high - you'll just say wow, great place, great food, great people, "THIS IS LIFE". Again, thank you! Below are some of the photos they help us took. :

We went to celebrate our anniversary and got to eat off the valentines menu. It was amazing. The food was delicious, the service was superb, and the view was breathtaking. Our waitress, PJ, was fantastic as well. We will definitely be back again.
5
My wife and I went for a special dinner on Chinese New years hoping we'd have a good view of the city and any festivities. The food, service, atmosphere, and views are all incredible. Our server, Rita, was amazing and took care of us the whole night, even getting us a table at the busy Skybar after our dinner. A must if you are in Singapore.
5
I almost always have bad experiences with restaurants with a view.. Either the food is average or the sevice is mediocre.. At the end of the day.. its just the view that you pay for.. Ce La Vi in Singapore proved me otherwise..Me and my fiance had a wonderful night!! We were greeted courteously by Arlan at the front desk.. Told is a brief history of the restaurant, asked us about our table preference.. Ushered us to our chair, and he graciously pulled out a chair for my fiance.. I appreciated that.. He was a gentlemen..Mischelle if i remember right, attended to us during our dinner.. She was a professional.. she made our dinner exceptional.. Anticipted our needs.. Made us comfortable.. Very courteous as well.. She went out her way to make a simple note on our dessert which we will always remember.. "Love knows no distance". You see, i flew from Dallas to spend time with my fiance.. I was touched and so was my finace.. The night ended with fireworks.. A pre- Chines New Year celebration overlooking the city.." A special night to remember".. forever grateful for your staff.
5
After a long and hot day in Singapore we finally reached Marina Bay Sands/Ce La Vi. We planned to stay for couple of drinks and enjoy views, but because it was my mom's bday we decided to have a dinner. It was a very spontaneous decision and even though it was Valentine's Day we managed to get a free table straight away. There is a minimum spend per person if you want to get a table. The food portions are very filling and big from starters to rolls/raws and mains. The service is amazing. The staff here makes sure that everything is perfect and you are just enjoying your dinner. Special thanks to Marycel for organising a bday cake for my mom. Unforgettable memories. Totally worth every penny

Our experience at this unbelievable restaurant is "one of a kind" & made our Valentine's dinner one to remember ! Great food ! Great ambience ! Great views ! And the service we received from waitress Rita was second to none ! A "must" when visiting Singapore !
5
Just celebrated Valentine's Day dinner with my wife at Ce La Vi. Really enjoyed their tasting menu! Fantastic host and our server Rita was excellent. And of course, the view is unbeatable...one of the best, if not the best, we have seen anywhere! Although the tasting menu is a bit pricey, but the quality of food, the excellent service, and the wonderful atmosphere made it all worth it. Will definitely go again for special occasion

Located at the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sand. Disappointment start immediately at the beginning. Dress code requested by the restaurant:" STYLISH CHIC (No bermudas or shorts and singlet or sleeveless) SUNDAYS we operate a more relaxed Dress Code"While you are arrived at the dedicated elevator you will find packed with 20 other persons. In fact the restaurant does not operate a dedicated list but share the same with the who is heading to the panoramic view at the 56th floor.Top of the top at the 56th floor the elevator unload who joined the floor and load who as to go down therefore to exit at the restaurants floor .. It's a mess. The restaurant offers an inside and outside venue. Inside is nothing particular, outside you can enjoy the view of the city (outstanding).Unfortunately the both the areas are very dark, so dark that is impossible to read the menu (they come with a torch) or to see the food. It's dark exactly as in the picture below. Food (modern Asian) overall discrete but not what you expect from such a location and from a restaurant that request a minimum 80$ per person order. The overall experience it ok but if we consider all it's a waste of time. Better to head vs different culinary offers in Singapore. I do not recommend the visit.
4
I had the dinner with my friend there. The foods are good and services is perfect. But our dinner was like we dine in the dark because of the lack of the light at place near by the entrance. We asked the staff for the flight and they provided us the USB lights
5
Two friends came to visit us in Singapore. Since the views are fantastic I though we take them to C'est La Vie, which sounds a bit apologetic- La Vie En Rose should have been better. Anyhow, I have heard mixed review from the past so my expectation on the food were medium. We were very pleasantly surprised with the level of service - excellent indeed, the choice of food - and the quality and taste of the food. Our friend couple were extremely happy with the family style 13 course meal (4 starters, 3 entrees, 4 deserts, 2 bottles of wine which also received great reviews, all c700 CGD incl 4 coffees).I will go here again for the food, and of course the views are unbeatable
5
I enjoyed welcoming the 2016 Chinese New Year while seeing the fireworks and the beauty of Singapore at the Ce La Vi Club. They serve good drinks and the best choco lava cake! Thanks to our guest service executive, Leo Lopez...friendly, always accomodating and efficiently attending to guests. I will surely come back here. Thanks for letting me experience a great night in Singapore

a place for young people with good music and breathtaking view at night. If you are staying in the hotel then there are no entry/cover charges.

Super cool place! The mixologist 'GURU' was awesome, his cocktails where the best we have had..... a must visit place....
5
Celebrated 7th year anniversary with wife here and Celavi is one of the few best views in Singapore I have ever been. Food was great plus the attentiveness of its staff made it more remarkable. Special shout to Leo and Levie for making it extra special. :-

(Bar review - not restaurant)We went here having read it was a better option than paying the admission fee for the observation deck. Admittedly the view is stunning, but the bar was filled with drunken back packers at 4pm in the afternoon. Music was loud, drinks were pricey (standard in Singapore). It's obviously a great party venue, but for a chilled and relaxed afternoon G&T with a view, this is not the place. It had a kind of Ibiza vibe to the place, which if that's what you're looking for - great! Not sure it is suitable for families or children. More club scene than restaurant.It also has that extreme 'selfie' culture, with people ignoring what they are looking at and instead capturing the 'We were here' moment. Overlooking the hotel pool was quite entertaining and equally irritating to watch! Always off-putting.I'm sure it's very popular for others, but not one of our favourite places in Singapore
4
In Summary:It is a great venue for family occasions and social gatherings.*DETAILED REVIEW BELOW*Background:The restaurant is always known as the restaurant on top of Marina Bay Sands and the place to be seen at, judging from the many social media posts, though the food was seldom the highlight. I went there as part of my anniversary celebrations. The booking of the restaurant was done a few weeks before.1. Service – 3.5 out of 5Service was a series of hits and misses, starting from the confusion during the opening of the restaurant, to the swift seating when we were served, to the sudden lack of attention halfway through the order. Along the way, we were served by three different waitresses. The redeeming factor was the attention given to my partner from one of the waitress who gave her a shawl when she overheard our conversation on the wind outside the restaurant being rather chilly.2. Ambience – 5 out of 557 storeys above sea level and overseeing the ever changing Singapore skyline, I do believe that this is hard to beat!3. Cleanliness – 5 out of 5Something to be expected from a restaurant of this calibre, and they have fared well.4. Taste – 3.5 out of 5Serving portions are just nice, taste of the dishes tend more to the mild side with a strong Asian influence. The pork skewers that we started off with were grilled well and retained its juiciness. My partner loved the dish though I preferred it a little more grilled. The mudslide that I ordered was pretty strong and chocolaty though it tasted very much like Baileys. The foie gras was served soon after and it was done very much to our liking. The mushroom soup was a disappointment though as it is effectively miso soup with some mushroom and spicy pepper added. Not to mention that it costs $14++ too! The steak was served soon after and it was meticulously separated into two portions as the waitresses noticed that we were sharing. The salmon steak was crisp on the outside while being cooked nicely on the inside. The beef slices were served next and we found it a tad too salty, probably going well with rice that we did not order. The dish that we enjoyed most though, was the baby broccoli that was served at the end for some strange reason. The broccoli was well grilled and it goes superbly with the sauce that accompanies it!5. Value for Money – 4 out of 5I believe that by choosing Ce La Vie as a dining occasion, one is ready to spend as the occasion or gathering is important enough to be celebrated at such a venue. However, prices are surprisingly reasonable despite the prime location and ambiance
5
the view is fantastic from the skydeck bar of ce la vi. you will see singapore good in the afternoon and also at night. Gail the serveuse is very accommodating always there when we need to ask anything. had a great afternoon in my last day in singapore
5
OK it's an expensive evening out but if you combine the amazing view, the great food, excellent service and just a fantastic overall ambience it's pretty hard to beat KU DE TA for a special evening out.I took my girlfriend there for her birthday along with some family and they all still talk about the night we had

I have decided to bring my friends who are visiting from Italy. View was breathtaking, food was great reasonably priced & ambience was amazing. Rated LOW due to poor & rude services. Firstly I called the restaurant at 1830 to see if I can make a reservation but was told that the next available seating is at 2130 therefore we decided to go around MBS & see if maybe another restaurant has something available. As we walk by CE LA VI hostess (ground level) & I decided to ask if anything opens up she said yes but only indoor seats as all outdoors seats are taken up but when we got up to Level 57 hostess asked if we like outdoors or indoors?! We decided with outdoors & to realised that there were at least 4-5 empty tables with no reserved. That's simply poor communication & planning among the hostesses. Secondly, hostess at ground level showed us a few menus & claimed that we are allow to order from any of the menus but waitress at L57 said "No! Only one menu!" When asked why?! Our waitress can not even explain, she simply left & we have to ask another waiter for help & we then found out that the other menu is for their club & is only available till a certain time. I understand that we have a fair share of Chinese visitors but please kindly make sure that your service staffs speak basic English. Lastly, our waitress (same waitress as above mentioned, she wasn't wearing a name tag) was simply rude!!! Came up to us & simply said.. "Order?!"; started clearing our dishes without even asking if we are done; using hand gestures to get my friends to pass her the used fork when she was clearing our table; she came while we are still having our mains & said "you are still short of $80?!" (As there is a minimum spending of $80 per person) told her nicely that we will look at the dessert menu after we are done with our mains; when asked what ice cream is available as menu only stated "Daily In-House Freshly Made Ice Cream") she answered "Normal Chocolate & Vanilla." - I was thinking why will I want to pay $18 for 2scoops of normal chocolate & vanilla ice cream?!. For a restaurant that is located at such an iconic landmark of Singapore with thousands of tourists visiting, is this the best service we can provide for our visitors?! 5-stars restaurant with 1-star service.

OK, OK... we all know this is a very tourist driven place, but sometimes the extra cost is worth it: this is one of those times. We booked a lunch table on New Year's Eve in order to welcome ourselves to Singapore, have a great view on an exciting day, and taste some of the delicious menu items. Unfortunately, as this was a holiday they were not offering their lunch time tasting menu, but we found some incredible tapas and dishes and out our own tasting menu together. It was delicious. The cocktails were tasty and well mixed, the food well presented and tasty and overall, we had a great lunch experience. I would definitely come back!. Why fight what works
3
There is a miscommunication with waiters, they came 5 times in less than 10 min to ask if we were ready to order (we just sat down! ) Food is good ! Couldn't say the same thing for the service!Decided to dine outside it took 30 min for a main course to arrive there is no equipment for wind or rain. Very expensive but you can get a view for free just going upstairs!

Guru is a funny guy and makes me laugh...his cocktails taste better than the other stand alone outlets....We love him..Guru rockzs

The view of course is really stunning at night, great food and drinks. Friendly staff, the manager Leo was so helpful and professional, so fun to talk to.

A great place to see people and city at level 57. There is a choice of a pool view as well as a city view.

We recently enjoyed a fantastic degustation lunch at SkyPark, Marina Bay Sands - Ce La Vi Restaurant. If you are looking for magnificent views and a delicious fusion of food, then you're looking in the right place. The service was great and our attendant, Rita, was amazing

First of all, the views from this are amazing. We were lucky enough to have the perfect table in the afternoon without a reservation and shortly after we arrived, it was packed with people waiting to sit.We had come to celebrate my birthday and what a setting! How many tourists can say they celebrated their birthday in Singapore at the top of the city:)We were all happy to be there. We ordered a round of drinks and lunch..and after eating waited for our server so we could order another drink..we waited our server to come back....we waited and waited....after 30 minutes someone in our party went to look for her and she was talking with a table of men on the other side. She said she'd come back to our table and did 30 minutes later. Did she ask us if we wanted another drink? NO.....Did she ask us if we wanted anything else? NO. When she came back she just set the check down and left.....then we had to hunt for her again to pay it.Are we glad we went? Of course! We were willing to spend the $400 for four with one drink and lunch. But would we recommend it to others? Probably. The view is worth it but as for the four of us, it was spoiled by a server who just didn't care. By the way, the party at the next table had the same problem as us. If I could have given a "negative" review for the service, I would have. What a shame because it could have been a perfect memory of Singapore

Been there a week ago and there is 1 guy there his name is guru , he really knw what he is doing and I was very impressed with his service and the way he interact wit me . Imma say he is a gr8 Mixologist. .. will be happy to come agai
5
Enjoyed a great Sky High Brunch, staff was amazing and interactive. Drinks were plentiful and the food was fantastic. Definitely sets the bar for a new experience for brunch in Singapore. Looking forward to the next one. Kirk was a great host and made the afternoon very entertaining. I highly recommend.

Sometimes you have to think less about the price and bite the bullet, this for me was one of those occasions. The service was slower than I would have preferred, the food was limited in quantity and on the expensive side, but the atmosphere and view is the highlight. Planning a visit around the weather is the best option if you have that luxury
2
Menu very poor, excessive prices, average food and don't expect to eat any European food. Total for 2 persons $270 with: 1 glass of red wine, 1 whiskey, 1 bottle of water, 2 main courses and 1 dessert. Finally you will pay only the view and nothing more
4
If you want to avoid paying for the viewing level of Marina Bay Sands and enjoy a drink and music, go to Ku de Ta. Yes it is expensive but a nice alternate option. Beer options could be more varied .Just watching people us fun.
5
It was the best experience I have ever had in a restaurant around the world! Great food&service, amazing staff! They have a dress code so you cannot enter in flip-flops&T-shirt.
5
Recommended by a friend, its one level above the observation deck and offers stunning views of the bay area. The skyline was decked up a little more due to Chinese New Year. Always a better option than the crowded observation deck.
5
If you happen to be at Marina Sands after noon, make a reservation and have lunch at Ce La Vie, a really good pan Asian restaurant. By doing this, you get the view from the top of the resort and a glimpse of the infinity pool!The dishes were imaginative, beautifully presented and super-tasty. Like everywhere in Singapore, the wine and beer was expensive, but for views and ambiance like this, it has to be worth it
5
With its exceptional views of the Singapore skyline, Ce La Vi does not disappoint. This Lavish restaurant / bar is a must for anyone visiting Singapore. A quick shoutout to Leo, who took care of us and made sure we never had an empty drink in our hand
4
Wen't for a company lunch and we had a great time enjoying the beautiful city views and the very delicious food and drinks. Not the cheapest place on earth but Singapore has even more expensive ones. The service is good. If you are after a decent lunch/dinner with spectacular views ... this is the place. Parking can be a hassle as it is 10 mins walking from the underground parking to the lift.
5
I've been there last week with some friends I was so impressed about the view, the food... We met Mr Leitner who care of us during for the dinner he was knowledgeable of the food and the wine and he was so efficient in his service he was polite and friendly. He also recommend to have a glass at the club. That was a really good advise we all have fun there.We will be back cause of such an amazing experience there, the best place in town for dinner and drinks
5
The First time I drop by Ce La Vi Restaurant Skybar, I tasted various cocktails that was recommenand by Kathi Guru. The drinks which was served by him was entertaining and the drink which I had was marvellous. & I had an unforgettable day which I enjoyed the most. I would definately petronise this outlet soon.
5
I visited last week and I was so impressed with the service from this Indian guy guru.he was knowledgeable of the drinks and he was so efficient in his service. He was polite and friendly.I will be back cause of such an amazing experience there. 2 thumbs up for ce la vi
5
Nice to return !An exquisite meal with matching views and table service. A special thank you to Rita for making our night a memorable one. We could not fault any of the dishes ordered . entrÃ©e choices - sticky squid and the pork belly lollipops. Mains - tempura prawns , seared scallops, California roll and broccolini sides . All dishes were cooked and served perfectly .A very enjoyable night out :-
5
One of the best restaurants we've been to in Singapore! Food was very appetizing, breathtaking ambience & to top it all, superb service!! Special mention to Sir Leo! Indeed first & world class that customers can look forward to! 👍
5
Had a great dining experience :)
Thank you Yul and Jess for taking care of our table :)
Cool and happy to be back again!!!!!
5
Great quality food and a very cool location with fantastic views. No pressure to leave the table after eating and access to the club for free. Its not cheap but definitely worth a visit.
5
Really enjoyed our pizza & cocktails overlooking the bay & the City. Visited the top floor just for the view and was tempted to have lunch and we wasn't disappointed at all! Choices on menu are pretty limited but that's not important with the views on offer!
5
We highly recommend this superb restaurant with a magnificent view.We were at the end of a long Asian trip & wanted one last special memory. Our hotel recommended Ce La Vi, which provided it in outstanding fashion. Maggie offered to help us select our meal. We wanted it light & spicy. Her suggestions were perfect! Our service from Vincent & Raj was excellent. The view was breathtaking. A wonderful memory (and pictures) to take home.
5
Arial Views of Singapore....Great Spot for Lunch or Dinner.... the Awesome Asian Fusion Menu..... well trained staff very attentive and knowledgable.... we had a couple of interesting dishes... Higher than your average Singapore prices but well worth it...... all excellent.....Compliments to the chef...
5
Been here numerous times and it never disappoints. The restaurant is located on the 57 floor of Marina Bay Sands which has a gorgeous view of the Singapore Skyline - Great place to chill or celebrate a special occasions like anniversaries (try asking for the table which has the view of the Gardens by the bay- it's more exclusive and private). Food is really top notch although servings can be small but it makes up in taste. For dessert I suggest trying the Coconut-Pandan Verrine. Staff is really friendly and accommodating, special mention to Leo who gave impeccable service. So if ever you find yourself in Singapore this place is a must visit
5
Fine dining with a magnificent view. We choose the Tasting menu along with the Pairing, and it was delightful. In my opinion, it is Japanese food combined with a french touch. Very fresh, and very pricey but worth it. Although it accepts kids, I do not recommend you bring them. Except for Sunday, it is a smart casual setting, so no flip-flops, shorts nor tank tops. Do make a reservation, and do stay for the lounge
5
It is very hard to find the right words that describes CE LA VI, you have to go for yourself. Then you'll get it. One word is MAGNIFICENT.Also a special mention for our hostess, "Sithra", thank you, your knowledge of food and drink was exceptional, friendly, happy, a pleasure to have you serve us. CE LA VI are very lucky to have you
5
Visited the place close to midnight after a hectic day touring singapore. Went on a weekday, the place was not crowded and got a nice place with almost 360 degree view of the city. The staff is friendly and made us comfortable. The drinks are not that expensive. Nice place to unwind after hectic routine, they play light music
3
Went to the bar at 9:30 pm for the view and experience. Very expensive drinks; service was very slow and the drink was just okay. Very, very crowded.
5
Food is delicious,Amazing scenery and high standing services from waitress and waiters. especially my server ken!
3
I have stayed at Marina Bay several times now. Last time was awesome here. This time around went in at 6pm. Waited and waited and waited. No service at all. Most of the seats reserved with no one sitting there. Went to the bar and waited. Then left without even getting served. At $16 for a bottle of beer and $8 for a coke expected better. Went to Sargos for deinks instead located on the same roof as Ce La Vi. Service was excellent and better priced. The view is just as good
1
I went to this restaurant with a few business associates. The food was average, catering I guess mostly to the inebriated crowd from the bar next door. We were told that there would have to be a minimum spend of $80 per person. And halfway through the meal, the serve staff started rushing us. When one of us got us to go out to smoke a cigarette, we were informed that we couldn't leave the restaurant till the bill was settled! This place epitomes the haughty service standards that Singapore is fast acquiring a reputation for.
5
The restaurant looks fairly ‘cool’ with comfortable seating and layout. The main reason you’d come is to get a glimpse of the spectacular view it provides. Unfortunately the restaurant area itself does not provide much in the way of view aware but you are able to go to the outside bar area where the wow factor kicks in – particularly at night. The service is fast and efficient and well executed. We ordered starters and mains to share for four and all meals were very good, well presented and arrived without too much of a wait. The standout was the pork spare rib lollipops! Definitely worth going for the view and paying a little more for the experience
5
This view is breathtaking. Beautiful sights. Nice service and reception. Had a lovely cocktail before our seating as we arrived a little early for our 8:30pm reservation. Ask to sit at restaurant outside near bar if you want to have view and comfort rather than inside the restaurant. Your receipt will get you into the club without overcharge if you wish and on the same floor. Note...go to lobby for elevator to restaurant - not to the basement - that is for the tourist deck. Great food and ask for Levie and Leo...they will take great care of you. FInally, the white wine was perfectly chilled and we had to have a second bottle
3
We had trouble getting a reservation and assumed it would be world class. Instead it was a disappointing experience as the Japanese style food was mediocre and disappointing. The California roll was equal to very low quality found in cheap sushi restaurants using processed crab. Everything was oily and the shrimp tempura heavy.
4
Rather than buying a ticket to go to the viewing gallery at the top of the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, go to the Ce La Vi restaurant for a drink, without a ticket. For the price of the ticket you get a drink AND the view. Of course you can have a fine meal too, if you would like.
3
My husband and I ate dinner here whilst in Singapore on honeymoon. The location on top of the marina bay sands promises great views however, sitting at a table in the middle of the restaurant you aren't able to benefit from these, yet you certainly pay for them!We had the tasting menu which involved a lot of food, too much really for us, it was all tasty and well presented and the service was very good but I do feel it was overpriced
5
Last week I was there with my wife to celebrate my birthday (reservation was done by my wife )...Let me tell you ladies and Gentlemen, It is a very fine dining place with very hospitable staff. The panoramic view from the outdoor are makes it an ideal location where you would like to spend nice time with you family. Cool fresh wind blowing outside supplements the chic environment and makes one feel comfortable. Since the seating is based on first come first serve basis ,we were lucky to get a place outside. Rita (Staff) made us comfortable and explained us the menu and was always on standby for any of our request.Although the food choice is not very large but whatever they have and whatever we tried was sumptuous and tasty. They have nice choice of wines, cocktails, whiskies and non alcoholic drinks. Deserts were simply awesome. Service was extremely fast.I would love to go there again and would recommend everyone to at least try out this place for the beautiful view it offers along with the high class of service and super good staff.Cheers !
5
The food was absolutely delicious, even the drinks!! It also has a great view!
The service was great! we asked the waiter somethings about Singapore and he told us amazing things.
they were helpful but they also let us had a special moment.
4
Had a family lunch at this restaurant on a beautiful sunny day! The food was good and the view outstanding. The service just average!
a bit overpriced but totally worth it for the amazing view!
5
We spent the NYE here, it was really nice with a lot of dishes to try. The manager or woman who was in charge was really friendly and happ to help, the restaurant has a nice view but if you are staying at the hotel you can get a better view closer
5
I had my birthday celebration at CÉ LA VI and it was my first time there. The place was breezy, relaxing, with a spectacular view! The staff at the skybar are very hospitable, amiable, courteous, and proactive. I had the pleasure to be assisted and entertained by John who works there and his colleague, Burn. I particularly liked the Espresso Martini cocktail I had ordered. I never thought martini would actually taste that good! I have to say I had the best time and experience at CÉ LA VI and you, whoever is reading this now, should go hophop and visit, too!
5
My friend and I got a table with a great view because we arrived early. Pretty soon the guests streamed in so we were really lucky.Our servers John and Burn were very accommodating and made sure we were comfortable. We couldn't decide what to get so they chose for us: the Singapore Sling, Amaretto Sour and the Espresso Martini. The Sling was flavorful but a bit strong to my liking. The Amaretto Sour was nice but the real winner for me was the Espresso Martini. It was delicious! The vodka wasn't overpowering and the coffee gave it a nice kick. Great job with the recs, boys!I will definitely go back to Ce La Vi.
4
Singapore, we are spoilt for choice when it comes to food. Unfortunately the Japanese/Western version is a lot to be desired. In fact we left quite a bit after a bite or two. Its not bad, but food would not be the consideration, in my opinion.For the positive, very friendly staff and good service. We sat inside the restaurant on a Friday night then continued with more drinks outside which was lovely. All in all, a good evening. Would go with friends for a night out
5
This restaurant sits atop the 3 Sands towers as part of a structure that looks like a boat spanning all 3 towers.....a unique piece of architecture in itself. The service was attentive. Menu is pricey, but we chose appetizer items that were certainly enough to share. Alcohol, including wine, is very pricey. The good part is that you do get access to go outside for photos, and not pay an admission price just to get to the top. The panoramic view makes it all worthwhile. Do make a reservation prior to going
5
I was there to propose to my girl friend and with the help of one of the waitress i think she just make my plan work really smooth! Her name is Rita and yes she is the most cheerful and friendly waitress I've seen in singapore and thanks to her too my girlfriend said yes when i ask her to marry me! Thanks for helping out for taking so many picture ls and not to mention a video when im proposing to my girlfriend.. The restaurant will be an awesome place for any event the view is just too stunning! The food was okay.. But we really enjoy our night thanks to Rita!!
5
Wonderful dinner on the terrace with direct view to garden by the bay. Amazing scenery and high standing services from waitress and waiters. A must drop by for dinner. Be mindful to make a reservation and to request for a table at the terrace where it is quiet and relaxing
2
I have been to this bar many times with business clients to have a drink, which are very expensive $20 for a beer, but the service behind the bar is terrible.Not one barmen behind the bar had a smile. I said to the barmen, why are you happy, he just looked at me and then continued to poor my beer. I wanted to get his name, but he didn't have a name tag on like the other people behind the bar.I gave him my credit card to pay and it took 15 minutes to get the bill!Terrible service! Get some staff that can smile and provide a memorable experience both with the view AND THE SERVICE.You want to be a venue in Singapore and Asia that prides itself on the view and service, well the service is poor and people need some training!I won't be back until i hear things have improved, ill spend the money elsewhere where the view can be similar
5
Loved the view and the music that was being played at the skybar! The DJ was great and helpful when I asked for some song titles. The bar crew needs to work on their customer service though, they are really arrogant.
5
the most wonderful view in singapore.a heady elevated atmosphere with friends ensured this visit of mine to be forever etched in my memory
5
Great food, great atmosphere. Tuna roll sushi, scallops & pork belly dishes were superb. Whether it's family dinner, date or night out with friends, Ce La Vi offers special atmosphere and delicious food.
5
Am a regular in this restaurant and the food was very nice, as usual. Service was excellent by our lovely waitress Rita. Usually taking visitors up to the restaurant as the combination of good food and stunning view never fails to impress visitors.
5
What a superb venue. From the welcome as you enter and the attention from the service staff, this restaurant is every bit the high end it claims. Every attention to detail in the food from the wonderful balance of flavour and texture and colour and exquisite presentation makes this a culinary delight. There is some serious culinary art and design going on behind the scenesWe picked 2 entrees , two mains and 3 vegetable accompianments expecting the minuscule servings of most haute cuisine establishments and were wonderfully surprised by portion sizes. Wine as everywhere in Singapore is very hefty in price so that would be our only little grizzle. We finished the meal by taking dessert outside on the balcony with magical views of the whole of Singpore from the 57th floor. A bit windy..the poor umbrellas were struggling to stay anchored but it really was special.Spoil yourself...for a special occasion or just like us...a wonderful finish to our Asian cruise holiday. High end price wise but worth every dollar
4
This restaurant is commendable. The food and the way it was presented were really good. Although quite expensive, it was worth it because you can have a view from the top of the Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Flyer , and other Singapore attractions. Staff were very efficient, cheerful, knowledgeable and polite (of course because our server is a Filipino). The restaurant itself is classy, comfortable with a choice of either indoor or outdoor dining. But that depends on the weather. A little sad because were not able to have a glimpse of the Infinity pool. Only for the eyes of hotel guests
4
We decided to go here on our last night in Singapore for the views. If you are not staying at the hotel, you can still go to the top and have a meal or drink and take in the views. Sunset is the best time although it is very crowded. If you are a hotel guest you have a separate area to take in the views and some people went up claiming they would have drinks but just took photos and went back down. We each had 1 drink and I can't remember the total but about $30 USD per person
5
I actually mean it. Why pay to go up and see the city if you can do it for "free" and eat great food? The restaurant serves modern Asian inspired fusion and it's delicious. The service is top notch and they have a great wine list. If you eat outside, remember that the wind will cool your food quickly, but it's certainly worth it.Our meats, and our starters were absolutely amazing, and the wine we'd chosen was great. But what I'll remember the most is the service. When you travel with children, it's always tricky. Our son was treated like a king and they even went next door to fetch him some french fries, twice! My second meal here, it won't have been the last one..
5
Ku De Ta has just got new name last year..Now is been cancelled Ce La Vi really a good club to hang out, with friends and family.My problem before was with the music really bad,i was so frustrated with the same music all the time. .So now finally the club change the management team, and the music has improved a lot ..As a place with a fantastic view a strongly recommend a visit, the food is quite nice as well ..Can't wait for my next ladies nigth at Ce La Vi..Ciao from now ..
5
Went to ce la vi ( Ces't la vie) for a drink w my hubby just before the sunset. It was a great time to go as we could see the view during the day & then during the night.Amazing views!!Had a couple delicious cocktails & one of the best waygu noodle soups EVER.Def worth a visit or two
5
booked earlier to have Christmas dinner was emailed menus and answered all queries the restaurant has the best views the service was great and importantly the food was wonderful a fabulous Christmas family dinner
5
Went here for a private party, bowled over by the views. You can even see the famous infinity pool from here. Expensive, but visit for one drink just to take in how stunning Singapore looks from up here.
3
I had the tasting menu, the food was good but did not wow me. Give the price and expectations I've had, I was somewhat disappointed.
4
We liked the location very much. Nice and very friendly staff. Very good food and a great view! A bit pricy but worth it. 100% recommendation!
5
I think this place has the greatest view you can see. The food and the cocktail taste really good. very high recommend for the one ho looking for a night out with good view and good cocktail
4
Have a very nice moments with family. Rita was excellent for her service and hospitality. Pleasant personality and always smiling., Food are very good and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Singapore and we will definitely be returning in the future!

Had dinner with husband on 1st day of 2016 as we wanted to try somewhere we haven't been to. I've read not so positive reviews online - pricey, poor service, average food - so i didn't go with high expectations. We had the indoor seats as honestly, i dont think there's much of a view and i wanted to avoid the strong winds. We were served by an attentive female staff (forgotten to ask for her name), and I really must thank her for asking me if I am ok if my scallops are not well done. I am not a fan of sashimi/half cooked food so she suggested for the scallops to be halved and cook it well done, this way, they will be fully cooked yet not too chewy. When the scallops came, lovely. The caulifower puree and soya emulsion added a mild sweetness to the scallop and the tempura edamame was an interesting touch to the dish. Hubs liked the tenderloin he ordered and it was done the way he wanted it. We ended with chocolate fondant which did not disappoint us. Chocolate fondant lovers will know the exciting moment when you first cut through the cut. If nothing oozes out, you'd probably feel like ditching the whole cake away. Ce La Vie's was no where near the trash bin, the oozing chocolate paired with the lightly sweet vanilla icecream and sourish berries compote could send you floating in happiness. Will definitely be back
5
We went here for our New Years Eve dinner and were not disappointed, even though the terrace could`t be opened before 9:30 p.m. and we had to sit inside, it was really nice. Good service and great food. The Sommelier Michael took really good care of us, thanks again. Would def. recommend to have dinner here. Enjoy the set menus with excellent drinks and citywide best view
3
The only reason for my rating is because the food is nothing to rave about. It is done well and served quick .Service was disappointing . You had to re explain what you wanted which is kind of weird . Atmosphere is fantastic tho. Height is always an advantage. No matter how bad the service people will still be there. Especially in a city where it is becoming more plastic that substance 
5
My boyfriend and I went here on our last night in Singapore back in September. When we first arrived we were welcomed and then took the lift up to the top floor where the restaurant is located. We were seated and greeted by our lovely waiter called Ken (if he's reading this, he deserves a promotion!) he was very good at explaining the menu to us and gave us a handy little clip on light to attach to our menus as the lighting was quite dim. He was very attentive the whole night! We ordered a couple of drinks, some starters - vegetable tempura and pan fried food gras and mains - Duck and Pork Belly with Shiso Flower fried rice to share. The food was really tasty and was very well presented. The atmosphere was perfect and the staff were very welcoming. At the end of our meal the assistant manager Maurice came up to us and asked us how our evening went and when we said it was our last night and we were leaving the following evening she wished us a safe flight and invited us to return again soon. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Singapore and we will definitely be returning in the future!
5
Amazing cocktails, fabulous views and good atmosphere. Drinks are expensive but it's worth the money, especially with the views on offer. The bar tender makes the most delicious cocktails ever!!
5
A wonderful location, with an incredible view of Singapore. The food was great, the wine list impressive and the service (Rita was the persone that attended to us) was everything one would expect and more.
5
Best views in town, fantastic service - thanks to Rita who took very good care of us!!! Food is good and ambience, enough privacy to talk business
4
Very good but expensive.
If you just wan to have the view, skip the restaurant and go to the Skypark bar.
5
We ate at the Ce La Vi restaurant on our first night staying at the Marina Bay Sands. Our waitress Rita was very friendly and helpful suggesting delicious menu items. A great evening with amazing views of Singapore. It's expensive but worth it!
5
This is a very special place, the food , the view and the atmosphere was just beyond words. You have to dress up and go there to celebrate a special occasion or maybe a date. It was my honeymoon and it was lovely.
5
I was fortunate enough to be traveling throughout Asia and was amazed at the level of service found in each of the cities, but nothing compared to my experience at Ce La Vi at the Marina Bay Sands. Coming from NY where rooftop bars are somewhat common, I anticipated it to be a similar experience, as in you go for the view, not necessarily the drinks, food, or service. I had heard about Ce La Vi (actually when it was Ku De Ta) from quite a few friends in NY nightlife before heading over, and now I see why.While they are under renovation (can't wait to get back and see what the new space will look like), the staff overcompensated through impeccable service, quality of drinks and humor (yes, the drinks were a bit pricey, but then again, so was the $140 chili crab lunch I had at no signboard cafe that had no view or scene).The bartenders were great, especially . They introduced me to a couple of the management team (Jeff and Kirk) who were both very personable and offered some great suggestions to get the most out of the minimal time I was there on business.It goes without saying that there is nothing I've seen in Asia that compares to the views, but don't just go for that reason alone.. Go there to get some great drinks and service! I will 100% be back
5
You don't need a lot of words to describe the former Ku de ta and now called Ce La Vi Restaurant. The food is fantastic, the view is stunning and a perfect service. I always love going back there, just make sure you are not on a budget
1
Be careful of this restaurant .... Very discriminating and a bit out to get you. Told that it was minimum $80 ++ per person , we were 3 people ; when we were upstairs , we were told it was $500 ++ if we wanted to sit outside , if not they told us to stand and eat, even though we said we were prepared to buy minimum a bottle of champagne plus food. In the end , we had some so-so food , overpriced like some of the reviews noted and terrible drinks ($30++ per cocktail) , and we had to stand and eat. We stayed at the hotel and ate at other restaurants there - dB bistro , Cut - all a lot better. I suggest you go upstairs to the public areas to take a look and leave. Even a cab driver told as that all the tourist go there to get conned. Won't be trying their Fine DiningMenu - just on principal
4
Of course its pricey but you pay for the view and quality of food . The view is great for dining but if only going for drinks then the view from One Altitude is actually better as you get to see MBS. Good for special occasions and if not for the price i would give it 5 stars, because even by Singapore standards its very expensive.The club is more lounge and very mainstream music for tourists just going for the tick box, or residents who don't mind paying over the top to be seen. There are far better clubs in Singapore but I will always take foreign company visitors new to Singapore there.
5
we spent 5 days in singapore and the highlight definately was our meal at ce la vi one of the best meals we have ever had the sevice was awesome from Lily and the whole evening was unbelievable
3
The view and ambience is spectacular but the food didn't meet my expectations considering the whole experience otherwise and the over the top prices. It's lovely for a one time meal but I doubt I'll choose to
go back again.
3
The restaurant itself is lovely, with beautiful views of Singapore city and the harbour. We had a nice table on the deck with a gorgeous view of the Gardens. The food was a bit of a let down for me. The grilled prawn salad was delicious, but the pork belly lollipops were OK. For mains, we had the Tiger Prawn Tempura (not enough salt in the dish), the grilled chicken Teriyaki (it was ok) and the grilled rack of lamb (this was nice). I recommend a visit at least once when you are in Singapore. If dining in, try and get a table on the deck. Or just visit for a drink and enjoy the view. Don't think I'll be going back
4
Our group of 6 dropped in for afternoon drinks and to admire the views. Ce La Vi is located on the Sky Park at Marina Bay Sands, 55 storeys, or 191 meters above the ground. The Service was good and the views amazing, but you Pay for it !! Unfortunately, when we visited in early September there was a heavy smoke haze from forest fires in Indonesia. Apparently this happens almost every year at this time, so you are better to plan your trip for earlier in the year, if possible
5
Make sure you take the furthest elevator if you want to go to CeLaVi. Or the very first elevator depending on what end the taxi drops you. The giveaway is a clear sign and big security guard who looks in your bag and requests your bottle of water.Drinks for 2 cost under 50 dollars (a french 75 and a non-alcoholic) Seating area was prioritised for dinners and we'd already had dinner at Mozza's downstairs so got to stand at one of the tall tables. It wasn't too crowded but being a grey day was quit chilli so we didn't stay long.Needless to say the view was worth the blitz fast ride up to 57th floor
5
For you to have the best table then make a reservation. Minimum spending must be 50+++. The food here is awesome plus the nice view of city, what can you ask for? The service is great and staffs are attentive. I keep coming back to this place.
5
My boyfriend and I spent a fantastic evening at Ce La Vie. We arrived early to avail of the amazing view over pre-dinner drinks. The night itself was showery so we were directed to the Club Lounge, where we enjoyed our drinks overlooking the city and the famous swimming pool. The drinks were very expensive but we knew to expect that. When it came time for dinner a server escorted us back to the restaurant. All of the staff were lovely. Rita our server was fabulous, as we hadn't been there before she explained the menu well and helped out with all of our questions.We order lots of dishes to share. My favourites were the Crispy Sticky Squid, Pork Belly and the Chocolate Lava Cake. My boyfriend highly recommends the Gora Cake. After dinner we enjoyed a drink on the deck, it was a lovely more relaxed atmosphere than the Club Lounge. We had a great chat to another staff member, not sure what his name and title were but we spoke about Singapore's history and people. All staff were so pleasant and approachable, I was given a scarf on the deck as it was a bit windy. Small touches like this make me recommend this restaurant very highly. We had done our research and were aware of the expense, but it's a once in a lifetime expensive for us!!!

We booked a table for 6 at the last minute and got a great spot outside...nice slightly cooler breeze! Rita looked after us and she was amazing! Nothing was too much trouble and she served us with a great smile and was on top of everything...best service we have seen for some time. Food was terrific and the whole experience really capped off our time in Sg!

Had dinner there last night and chose the resturant based on its food award review mmmMm huge mistake..Firstly had the degustation menu at $180.. Per personStarted with sushi, which was not bad but nothing the local sushi train could not have done.Then got served duck, which was tough for suis viede so doubt it, grilled chicken skewers and battered greasy lobster pieces that you had to find the lobster in the oily batter.Next came beef cheeks and foie gras, which if I was a betting man would have said it was just duck liver. Have eaten foie gras in many places in the world this was no fois gras but undercooked half raw duck liver still with sinew inside..We did not even eat the meal but not to embarrass my daughter paid the crazy $720.00 bill no wine...and walked out. We ordered room service..So disappointing will never return..

I came here after I tried to find a table on another restaurant and was closed for a private party. As I got to the reception at the entrance, the receptionist warns me that minimum consumption is 80 sgd per person. The whole thing sounded fishy already when they have to tell you upfront that you have to at least spend 80 per person, which for me sounds very unfriendly and pretty much translates to, "we are not interested in low ballers here". I don't mind paying more for good service and excellent food but what comes next definitely couldn't be described as such. As I guessed so, it wasn't very hard at all to reach the minimum requested. Me and my girlfriend ordered a glass of wine, a tomato "salad" and a salmon salad as entrance dishes, one sirloin steak for me and lamb for her plus one side for each. At the end we shared a desert. The amounts were so ridiculous small that when the tomato "salad" came we started to laugh out loud. It was basically one and a half chopped tomato. Price for one and a half chopped tomato? 18sgd (plus taxes and service). So more then 20 bucks. The portions of the other orders were not much different. I paid almost 300 bucks for the whole dinner and when I got home I had to grab some crackers in the cupboard because I was still hungry. I guess the least someone could expect after paying as much is to leave the place feeling satiated. The service was average to say the least. I have been to places which were cheaper, the food better, the waitresses friendlier and actually caring if you need something else and if everything is perfect. The extra point I gave was because the steak was indeed tasty (although small). Please give your money some value and don't support such places which exists just to ripoff tourists

Amazing view of Singapore. Excellent service by Rita our waitress. Food was great. This is a must go to place if you are in Singapore for business or pleasure.

Went for our Anniversary dinner. Great service, food & view. Nice music. Very tasty food. A bit expensive with minimum $80 per person. For a special day it was worth it.

amazing location, delicious Food, nice and kind Service, our waitress for the evening Rita did a wonderful Job!

Marina Bay Sands is inconic for all visitors to the city and is easily identifiable from a distance. Ce La Vi gives everyone the opportunity to enjoy the extravagance if only for an evening.Placed atop the hotel at the stern of the boat there is infoor and outdoor seating. We booked 2 weeks in advance and being the first to book meant we had first choice of table; requesting one on the edge with a great view and got just that.The waitress really couldn't have cared less if we had a good time unfortunately but we didn't let that ruin it. It is compulsory for men to wear trousers and shoes.The food is a Japanese fusion. We had a sushi plate and the beef plate to share as a starter which were delicious. The main courses were large, filling and very flavorsome (tuna and salmon). Desserts were scrumptious and large again.Unfortunately our wine was warm upon serving - not what I would expect at the exubrant price of SG$120 (Â£60).The overall experience cost SG$450 which is one of the most expensive meals we've ever had. The food was great and large portions - it's just unfortunate the staff we met are not fully endorsing the price tag.I would recommend everyone goes here for the experience but maybe enjoy a cheaper lunch or just drinks (be aware of the minimum spend - SG$80 per head)

We love CLV. If it's rainy or too windy the bar may be closed, but last Sunday this was not the case. The bar was open. It was also very windy so we decided to eat inside. But given that they had opened all the windows (first time we experienced this, I wouldn't think it was a great idea by the way) we had to sit far inside otherwise the wind was too strong up there. The food, as always, is great, really great. The desserts are amazing and we will go there again, no doubt. A slight mistake in the bill which they hadn't noticed (in their favour) was corrected after we pointed it out. They also arranged a surprise message and complimentary warm flowing chocolate cake with ice cream, absolutely delicious by the way, for my wife's birthday. One of the top places in Singapore.

You need to go there - Singapore - Fly wheel - is nice - but this is much more. On the top of Marina Bay Sand - open deck - under the sun or starry night - it is simple magnificent view. Do not stay inside - you need to sit outside - with amazing view to Singapore Strait and City - day time - chose your time wisely - if it rains - all will be spoiled - night time - amazing view - similar to "Symphony of Light in Hong Kong". You can enjoy the food - which is by the way very good and affordable - drinks as well. If you have spare time - just go and enjoy it - it is worthed every penny - all will find a moment of enjoyment - business or holiday trip - and DJ is mixing up quite well. Enjoy it - you deserve it
3
If you are going for the view you won't be disappointed...however I think the food and cocktails are quite over rated compared to other bars in Singapore. The wine / cocktail list is fairly limited and lacks attention to detail. Staff were amicable but there are better places...Singapore is spoilt for choice

The novelty value of the unusual hotel design and the evening view of Singapore from the 57th floor of this place is the obvious draw. It is a tourist experience though and does not appear to aim for repeat business.The crowds and the resulting over controlling of movement mar the experience and the staff "policing" the place (though not the table serving staff) could not be described as friendly and meeting the generally high service standards of Singapore.Various levels of segregation exist in this floor limiting where you can go which are not clear until you arrive and try to walk around the area. The intention is to limit restaurant and bar guests to a specific leased area only and the place is very controlling ( minimum spend, limited seating time, standing room only bar area).A bottle of wine ordered from the bar was not cooled "as we have cooling problems" was not a good start. Moving to the inside restaurant,we were initially shown to a very poor table despite being on time and booked well in advance. Told every other table was booked, we made to leave immediately when suddenly a far better located table, albeit set for 6 was offered which was fine so we stayed.Things then improved. The table service was excellent and the food good and the pricing no higher than one would expect from such a venue. The evening was eventually rescued
5
Many world cities boast a restaurant with outstanding views, but few combine the casual atmosphere and excellent food offered by Ce La Vi. The sushi and beef were of high quality, and the simplicity of the atmosphere emphasized the experience. A fantastic place to meet colleagues or friends depending on budget for drinks, dinner or a night cap
5
The location is fatastic with the magnificent night-time views over Singapore.The food is modern Asian and is good. The portions are small and ideal for sharing, so don't make the mistake of only ordering 1 dish per person. This is not suffient and is not the concept. I think we had 10 for 2 people, which was perfect.You can sit inside or outside. Outside there are fans that create a pleasent breeze, so it does not get too hot.The outside Bar is also really nice, serving reasonable cocktail, with a great view if you can get to ther front. This is a great place just to hang out before or after dinner, especially if you want to impress someone.The service is first rate throughout, efficient and friendly.Quite a mixed clientel - young, old, expat, tourists and even locals :-) so you always seem to fit in.OK, all this does not come cheap, so be carefull if you are on a budget
5
Wow! The food...the service...the view....the atmosphere...simply AMAZING and SPECTACULAR. our waitress for the evening was Sarah and she was very nice and sweet! She made our evening delightful with her great recommendations! Overall the place is perfrct. Mu husband and I loved the food.
5
We had a fantastic lunch and thunder/lightening display at Ce La Vi. Special thanks to our attendant Rita who was super wonderful and most helpful catering for my gluten free requirements.
5
We dropped by the the place for a quick snack. It was a Sunday so the place was busy. Pizzas were simply awesome as well as the table service from Levlyn and Farak. :)
5
There are lots of restaurants in Marina Bay but this one has amazing view and you can sit outside. Food was excellent , very fresh.Our waitress Rita was very attentive , gave good recommendation on food and wine choice. She extremely helpful and had the biggest smile in Singapore!! Thank you for giving us a perfect last night in Singapore
5
CÉ la vie offers a great view, delicious food and great service. A must visit in Singapore - not only for the view. Great wine selection!After a few drinks and good food - head down to their club for more drinks and an unforgettable night out in Singapore
2
Met with friends for cocktails and dinner to enjoy the view of this magnificent hotel. Cocktails were extremely average. A Cosmopolitan tasted nothing like it should, so we had a gin and tonic next which tasted peculiar, after asking what it was we realised they were using tonic from a pump dispenser which was disgusting - and all for the bargain price of £12. Dinner was ok but again extremely overpriced, everything cost extra and portions were tiny. House wine was almost £70 a bottle, now I know taxes on liquor are high but really???Better meals and better value to be had elsewhere. The view is great though
1
This is an overpriced rip off. The only good thing about the restaurant is the view. Overpriced tiny portions of mains and you still gave to buy sides - again overpriced.Quality of the food was good but pricing does not match it with the miserly quantities.Drinks were also overpriced with juices matching alcoholic drinks prices.I am convinced that the management only wants the rich and famous. Fine by me as we won't be returning and I will be telling all my friends and family in Australia on top of those who read this review.Very expensive for a view
5
I was kicking myself for not going here earlier. I had previously brought friends and relatives to Marina Bay Skypark paying a $20 entry charge per person. The thought to check out the bar above didn't cross my mind. Till I went went there with a couple of colleagues last week. Boy should I have gone there earlier.Entry to the bar & therefore some of the best views of the Marina Bay area are free. Ofcourse you dont go to a bar and not buy a drink. The drinks were reasonably priced (they are not cheap, but not prohibitively expensive either) and the atmosphere was nice. If you intend to go to the Skypark anyway, I seriously recommend hitting the Ce La Vi instead - even for the wallet conscious as you will save on the Skypark Entry ticket
4
One level above the SkyPark at the Marina Day Sands you will find a good Japanese restaurant with tasty sushi and views from its windows and decks every bit as spectacular as those from the SkyPark. The prices are a bit high, but you've saved the admission fee to the SkyPark.
5
My friend and I wanted to view Singapore from the top of Marina Bay Sands, but didn't want to go to the expense of dining in the restaurant. We could have paid to go up to the building's viewing platform, but instead elected to have a drink in Ce La Vi's bar. We chose a Sunday night, when we understood access to the bar alone was less restricted. The view was sensational. Cocktails cost about $S24 each, but that was close to the price of a viewing platform ticket, so we thought it was good value. The view is better from the viewing platform because it extends out further than the bar area. But we thought it was great to stand in the bar, drink in hand, soaking up the atmosphere and taking in the view of this amazing city!
5
Excellent modern Asian food, very kind service, the best sky bar in the world and a groovy night club.
The selected menus with wines are of good value.
Really perfect!
4
We spent a night dinning in this restaurant at MBS and, although it is a pricey restaurant the environment, food and staff made our night really special. Thanks you all, specially to our kind waitress Ken.

My husband and I visited Singapore for our honeymoon and decided to book a table in Ce La Vi for our last night in Singapore. We were so impressed with their food and service. We went for the tasting menu and it was so worth it! The serving size we thought was perfect! We highly recommend the prawn salad and salmon sushi tempura. I don't usually like going to fine dining but Jess our waitress for the night was so lovely and very accommodating. We were also surprised by the cake they had for us in the end of the night and even moving us to the outside table so that we can have a beautiful of MBS! Also their cocktail range are amazing! We will definitely go back to Ce La Vi in our next visit
3
I had lunch with my wife and for a small carafe of sake, a glass of wine, aubergine dish, California roll, pork cheek dish and tempura tiger prawns, chocolate dessert and a goma cake and ended up paying over S$300. The food was OK. The price way over the top because you are paying for the view. The staff were very helpful and attendant to you.The food is mainly for sharing and although it's euro Asian cuisine it seems to be heavily influenced by Japanese. The pork cheek (cheapest cut on an animal although priced over S$35 here) wasn't good, somewhat bland. Couldn't understand why they added red chili which didn't taste. California roll was good. Tempura tiger prawns have are poorly battered, more like off the shelf batter than a usual Japanese tempura batter and drizzled with a curry sauce. The chocolate dessert was good but the goma cake was more for the visual aspect than for the taste.I heard a couple of tables complaining that the food was not good, one for example the chicken was very tough and another that there was a long gap between each persons dish.In all I will not be going back there even though it had a nice atmosphere. Just another poor attempt, tourist trap in what is supposed to be a first class venue
5
Alright, stop. If you're thinking of booking elsewhere - don't. My wife and approached this meal with some trepidation, our 9mth old and a potential evening of pain. But the night was amazing. The staff were the best we'd ever experienced anywhere in the world. They loved having an infant in the restaurant, and for us, that was really special. The food was outstanding. We had the tasting menu. 13 courses of mouth watering flavours knocked together like its no body's business. Gordon Ramsay and his sailor's mouth would've had trouble finding fault. And the matched wines were divine. Don't go here if you just want a meal, go if you want an experience.

Dined at this fabulous restaurant on my recent visit to singapore. Location is tops, you can see views of the city. We had drinks at the bar on the terrace, lovely spot to unwind. Dinner was also at the terrace...staff very attentive. Our waitstaff Kumar promised to come and show us how to eat the rather unusual desert we ordered...and he did so with much expertise. Really appreciated that! All the dishes we ordered were all very tasty and nicely presented. Servings are small portions so you need to order more...we were correctly informed by our waitstaff, who also recommended some dishes, and they were all superb, as promised. Prices are a bit expensive, i guess that's the price to pay for a top location dining spot. We left this place fully satisfied and happy. Would gladly go back there on my next visit to singapore
5
We had a stop over in Singapore and wanted to experience the view from Marina Bay Sands so we booked Ce La Vi restaurant prior to our arrival. We found the staff very professional as they kept us informed and confirmed our booking a couple of times. Upon arrival (we got there early) but we were able to go to the bar and order a drink prior to our dinner and take on this amazing view. By arriving earlier we got to see the light and sound show also. Our experience just kept getting better as we sat down for our meals. Rita, our waitress for the night was helpful in explaining the menu and making sure she attended to all our needs very professionally. She was friendly without being over bearing. The meals we ordered were delicious and we left the restaurant extremely satisfied. We will definitely recommend this experience to all our friends and family. Jack & Marin

My husband made the reservation and asked for a table in a quiet area. There are tables near to the bar and music. We didn't want that. We had a nice table with a great view on gardens by the bay.The food was good. California roll, vegetarian roll, lamb chops, heilbot fish, aubergine and chocolate fondant. Minimum you have to spent per person is $80 on food.
5
Living just across the causeway in Malaysia I'd had MBS on my list for some time, and during the F1 got the chance to visit Ce La Vi thanks to friends of mine. Fantastic view (ignoring slight haze) and fantastic service - although some of that might have been due to the fact we were in the VIP area. Very crowed throughout, but again, I didn't expect anything less during the F1 weekend.Dress up not down. Flexibility on this seems to depend on how much you plan to spend
5
I always come to this restaurant, especially bar and club lounge. for budget traveler, should you chose bar or club lounge than chosing their restaurant, it will cost minimum payment.this is the best place to chill out while on singapore. the view are amazing. for further info you can go to their sites
5
We had good food there. The fried rice and fried calamari are great. Service is excellent. Jess made excellent meal recommendations, and she went out of her way to give us a tour outside.
5
my 4th visit apart from business matters. it has always been the view from the restaurant and the atmosphere which attracts me the most
4
This is a beautiful spot to be with the in crowd and a view to match it too. Just be aware it can be a bit pricey for drinks and food but you pay for the view as well, real nice, must do....
1
I visited this bar for a quick drink and the view and had been considering taking a group of clients here for dinner, wanting to see the venue for myself. Unfortunately, the staff were presumptuous and rude as they placed 'Reservation' tickets on each table for 'diners only' after we had already sat down for our drink - at just past 5.15pm. Reservation signs were across all tables so I understand the logistics in managing diners' tables, however there was no simply courtesy or manners in the delivery of such information to customers that this venue needs to work on. The staff member in question was not hospitable or friendly in explaining that we simply had to move, rather his arrogance and rudeness in yelling 'well the tables are for the diners..!' was insulting. The drinks were overpriced (the most expensive we have ever paid) and the staff appeared uninterested in taking your order at the bar. Other guests joked with me that we will have to wait a while despite the bar staff not serving any guests at that moment. Having worked for a 5 star international hotel chain, such poor customer interaction would simply not be tolerated - ever - despite how busy you are. I suggest Mr Mokomoko, that you invest in some courses in giving 'Exceptional Customer Service' that will assist your staff in their roles and will help your venue to better reflect the international hospitality service standard I'm sure you are hoping to achieve. Needless to say, we left Ce La Vie and did not proceed to book in our party of 10 for a function. As an Events Manager, this venue will no longer be on my list for client entertaining. I wish you much luck with your future endeavours

One of the landmarks in Singapore offer a sky bar and nearby Ce La Vi bar, which offers great view over the Singapore bay, incase it is not raining. The bar is made for after work chilling and attracts also a lot of tourists. The bar furniture is a bit worn out, but it does not matter much if you are interested about city views. Unfortunately there was a lot of renovation noise in the bar, but luckily we got seats at the terrace, where the noise was not so disturbing
5
More than the view, what is most memorable (and reason to go back) is the prawn salad. The bed of baby spinach drizzled with lime juice, grilled prawn topped with parmesan cheese and fragrant truffle oil was just to die for. The view was spectacular, of course, but if one works in a high-rise building in the CBD or has taken the SG Flyer (giant ferris wheel), I'd say the view would be almost the same.Doing dinner in a hip, happening fine dining restaurant and bar mostly patronized by foreigners is, of course, still worth telling about. The other dishes we ordered didn't disappoint either: seared tuna, asparagus, grilled prawn, and the gabo dessert of black sesame cake with a melange of fruits.The waitstaff Lily and the supervisor Ryan were also commendable, making sure our dining experience was a very pleasant one. Thank you!I'd say give it a go, not so much for brag-talk but for the experience. And while you're at it, get the prawn salad
5
My fantastic opinion regarding this perfect dinner, was due to the Great Assistance that the Sommelier, Djessa Reyes did with our Group. Thank you Djek! This kind of effort is how one can achieve this kind of revenues. However the Chef did also a great job on preparing a fantastic set Menu on the theme of the restaurant.After dinner Djek continued the assistance on the Ce La Vi Skybar, The whole group was amazed with the service
3
Dined here for Lunch. They are keen for the table to order food that can be shared by all. If that works for you, that's fine. The size of the sharing plates was not overly large. The food was okay but not special. Prices not that cheap. The views are nice. We all wanted to go out on the viewing decks and really enjoy the special views. Regrettably in spite of having dined for lunch, we were clearly told unless we were staying at the hotel we were not allowed. What a disgrace - u have already paid for the view in the restaurant but then you are not allowed to access the full view. Disgrace...
5
This is a must visit place at least to get a drink and see the view, located in the 50something floor. The open bar feels great as weather in Singapore is always great and warm. You can go and get a drink or visit the restaurant. The bar gets crowded around midnight
5
I was only in Singapore for two days and I knew I needed to get over to this amazing place with a cruise ship on the top of it! I can't comment on on the food, because I only went for drinks and the view, but the drinks were great and the view? Oh my god, so amazing. The buildings, the ships in the harbor, the Singapore Flyer, so much to see. Just spectacular. Although the view from the deck where we sat for drinks was awesome, I was a tiny bit annoyed that they wouldn't let us go down to the "main deck" because that was for hotel guests only. The price for the drinks were a bit pricey, but that didn't surprise me
3
To sum it up you gut very good food for a very high price and you can enjoy a great view. We spend about 180 € without getting crazy on food or drinks.
5
Tried the tasting menu with matching wines, it's worth it and what a beautiful venue! I went with a friend but this is so good for coupes! Also the outside lounge bar with stunning views was great after the meal
3
Not very personal service, food ok but no extra. You can really feel that this restaurant knows it will get customers without trying to hard thanks to the view.
4
Amazing view of the Singapore Bay, great food, music and suitable price. Enjoy and discover the pool at the top of this hotel.
4
While at the SkyPark we stopped off for lunch. We found the staff to be professional and friendly, the food was reasonable priced and of good quality.
3
If you are looking for a place with a stunning view to impress your partner, this would be the right choice. The ambience of the restaurant is romantic and comfortable. Staff is attentive to your need without being too intrusive. However, there is some hits and misses with the food . Most of the food was a little too cold when served. In overall, the dessert are the one that stands out of all the dishes. Best dish of the day was the chocolate molten cake(to die for). We even ordered 2 servings of the molten cake.
5
Went for dinner with friends...advise to book in advance especially for weekends as it is busy busy busy.Views are great and the food is to a very high standard. If you like Nobu, Zuma and generally pan asian food, this is for you.We will be bac

I had thought this might be a restaurant that was all style and no substance, however I was blown away by all aspects of our evening here. When I booked via email I requested a nice table as it was a special occasion and sure enough we were given a wonderful spot on the balcony with a fantastic view. Unfortunately it started to rain at the beginning of our meal, but we were moved inside promptly and with a minimum of fuss. The food was all absolutely delicious, particularly the salmon sashimi and the tuna tataki. Afterwards, our server Rita (who was an absolute delight - friendly and attentive yet unobtrusive) surprised us with a dessert plate to celebrate our anniversary which I'd mentioned when booking. It was a really lovely, personalised touch and a great way to end the night
1
The first time I took my wife here for her birthday, after a lot of requests to an uncooperative staff, they made us an eggless desert. The second time we made a reservation and requested the same desert. Not only did they say that cannot make it, but they said that it was impossible to make it eggless. (clear discrepancy here)They wanted us to settle for fruit and sorbet as our birthday celebration.Even when I visited East Africa, the staff was happy to accommodate our dietary requests
5
After initially being put on a table near the DJ where we couldn't hear to talk we were moved to a fantastic table with the most amazing views overlooking the Botanical Gardens. We arrived just before sunset so we had the pleasure of seeing the views in daylight and darkness.Our waitress, Lily, couldn't have been more attentive and took the time to chat with us with such warmth. It was our 2nd night in Singapore and our first visit to the Far East.The food and general experience was wonderful and certainly a night I shall remember for the rest of my life.Once we had finished our meal we were surprised with a delicious pudding with Welcome to Singapore written in chocolate - what a lovely touch! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Singapore and if you're lucky enough to meet Lily please thank her again for making such wonderful memories on our holiday
5
food was fantastic and Michael Leitner the somelier was excelent, friendly and real professional. Had a great time and will definitely come back again.
5
200 meters above sea level somewhere up in the sky surrounded by the Singapore skyline - breathtaking. We had the best waiter ever: Rajat has done a super great job. We would love to be served by Rajat everywhere all the time.
5
Fabulous food, Attentive staff and amazing views! Although on the pricey side, it is worth every penny. Felt very special and loved every minute of our dining experience.
4
The experience is definitely memorable. The service is impeccable from the service staff and they know their menu very well. The food served are awesome especially the beef dishes!! We ordered the snapper or some fish but because it is not fresh (says the chef), the dish is cancelled. We were pleasantly surprised that we were served with complimentary tuna belly instead! Exceeded our expectations; I'm impressed. After our meal, we had desserts and even though I was so full, I still ate because they are so yummy!!! Now, in order to dine here, you have to spend at least SGD80 and that's very costly if you are from Malaysia (sob sob for me). In any case, I am willing to pay because of all the good things I've said but I wouldn't be able to come too often
4
I visited KU DE TA with a group of friends just before sunset. The views are the best in Singapore and the view onto the huge pool is also worth a look. The cocktails are good and the music isn't too loud so you can talk at a comfortable level
1
We were looking forward to a fabulous meal in what looked like a beautiful setting.The tables outside were so big and we were then put at a table under the speakers. We then got moved to an inside table. It was average...The food which looked amazing on the menu was tasteless and very uninteresting. We didn't even finish the meal as the pork was fatty and tough. The other dishes were cold and not presented well. We had one bottle of wine which was around $168 dollars. The bill was $424.90 what a rip off.Maybe the head chef needs to dine there and pay our bill..
5
Had dinner here at 8.30pm on a Monday night for two. We requested an outside table which was perfect. We had great views of the cost and admired the views of the city while having pre dinner cocktails.The food was exceptionally nice. I would recommend the pork belly lollipops!Meal for two with wine came in at around 250SGD. Highly recommend!

This was my second visit to Singapore. More like a business trip and not the touristy kind I had a couple of years ago with my wife, kid and parents. In my last trip I was quite intrigued by the Marina Bay Sands Hotel (the boat on three towers) however between Sentosa, Universal studios etc..Marina just got left (except some shots where it is in the background). The hotel is just that ...a luxury hotel which could mean different things to different people. However a highlight for the tourists at the Hotel is the view which it offers of city, which is magnificent to say the least. A mistake which tourists often make is to go to the sky deck and pay up 25 odd Dollars for admission. A simpler and better option with great music is to walk into the bar and enjoy a beer on the tap for roughly 20 Dollars and get a pool side enclosure with the view of the city of Singapore in all its colors. Evenings are a great time (before and after sunset) as the colors give way to the incredible lights. A nice crowd gets going at the place after sunset partially because there is free seating till 9PM. We had a couple of beers and got up at 9 when the hosts politely informed us that the seats were reserved. All in all probably one of the best sky bars in this side of the world (SE Asia)
3
We came here for lunch and were rather disappointed especially since this place is rated so well. Perhaps it's better for dining than for lunch. The Good:Excellent, unparalleled view of central Singapore with all its marvelous landmarks. The Not So Good:1. The food was just average, especially for the price. 2. The ambience was blah and the upholstery was coming off in so many places that it seemed more like a cheap diner. 3. The restroom is located a whole floor below the restaurant floor, with no elevator, escalator or ramp access. Never seen such inconvenience anywhere before. For a better food experience, service and fairly good views, try Sky on 57, on the other side of MBS
5
We were in Singapore for only one weekend and went to Ce La Vi to hang out and relax. The view was absolutely stunning from up there! Drinks with a great view of Singapore was just perfect! We enjoyed every minute of our stay there and would love to come back again the next time we visit! Kudos to Michael also for the great service and making sure we had the best selection of drinks!!!
5
(Just wrote this for Ku De Ta which was its name before) - simply divine venue, excellent food, excellent friendly staff and a restaurant I would return to when back in Singapore. Loved it!
5
Excellent ambience and service .. Michael Leitner is the best !! Everything is good.. We surely we keep coming back here and will recommend to my friends. 😍
4
You can't argue with that location and view...spectacular and with a certain genius loci. Often such places disappoint with the actual dining experience. Not here. Generously spaced, with friendly and attentive staff, the spirited atmosphere is enhanced by the buzz of the bar wrapped around the mid-sky terrace. While the tasting menu appears to be the must have choice, our more modest selection of wild snapper sushi and tuna carpaccio for starters was beautifully presented and convinced with exquisitely balanced flavouring. The mains of black cod and braised pork cheeks were equally convincing. Almost too pretty to eat, both dishes were excellent and almost too copious to complete. I had to catch a flight, otherwise my only complaint would have been the strict two hour time limit. La Vi is good up here
5
We had drinks on the outside deck before moving inside to have lunch. We ordered our tapas style dishes to share and had the most excellent surprise on the quality of the food! The live entertainment suited a mood to sit back, enjoy the food and share a lot of laughs. We will be returning - maybe next time eating more and drinking less for our wallet's sake ( food a much cheaper option to the drinks).

Second time at Ce La Vi and every bit as good as before. The food was simply terrific from start to finish, with excellent service from Ara who was really on top of everything. The manager, Rohana, had organised a lovely table by the window for us and as we were celebrating our daughter's birthday they brought out a complimentary dessert with a candle on it - the dessert was excellent too. Favourite dishes for me were the tenderloin and the sushi rolls but really you can't go wrong with anything you order. Thoroughly recommended
5
Celebrated our anniversary with friends at CE LA VI, l had asked for a view if possible and got the most amazing seats overlooking the Gardens by the Bay. Our waiter David was efficient courteous knowledgeable attentive a credit to the restaurant.It made for a wonderfully memorable evening, would gladly recommend to all. We will be back
4
It's fairly noisy with a live DJ, and the staff tend to hover a bit too much, so don't expect a romantic evening, but for fun drinks or a meal, you can't beat the scene and the view. Food is excellent, and the menu is fairly diverse
5
First shout out goes to our awesome and attentive waiter Ken who was always on top of things and made our dining experience a night to remember. Ken arranged a complimentary dessert for us as we were on our honeymoon. We will forever be grateful for your kind gesture!Second shout out goes to Peng Yu - a one of a kind bartender! With his experience and wealth of knowledge with cocktails, he came up with a creative drink that wasn't on the menu. After being really satisfied with our meals my wife and I needed a digestive drink. We normally drink limoncellos but as they were not on the menu, Peng Yu created a similar drink!It was a honeymoon complimentary drink and again we are so grateful for your kind gesture. Thank you again! Final shout out goes to the restaurant, chefs, waitstaff and management. You guys were so accommodating from the get go and made our night a night that will be embedded within us forever. Thank you for going beyond your duties and providing us with an outside table with such great views! As we respect and appreciate the high volume of people that come to the restaurant and request an outside table, we will be forever grateful for accommodating us! The food was spendid and cannot fault it. The food was exceptionally of high standard along with the service provided. The dessert was absolutely to die for! Our advice to people would like to come here, please do so and make sure you make a booking in advance. It is an Asian experience you'll never forget. The food is unique, fresh and presented nicely. You will not be disappointed!

Attended a stand up business cocktail function at Ce la vi. Great venue with fantastic views over the city. Unfortunately the haze impacted the view somewhat. The indoor restaurant area is quite small with majority of the space outdoor so did get hot. canapé food was great quality

There can't be many better settings anywhere than on top of the fabulous Marina Sands skydeck open air looking down from the 57th floor. Had a very nice table inside and the staff were all top notch.We choice the 11 dish tasting menu started with 2 very nice coctails and then a bottle of red wine. The 11 dishes come up in 3 or 4 servings all beautiful presented and worthy of any top end resturants. I wasnt that keen on the foi gras but thats just a personel preference as visual its was presented very well. Loved all the other dishes and nice touch becaus ewhen the waiter learned lt was our honeymoon he arranged a wonderful free dessert, lovely touch.Its a cheap menu as the setting is top end as is the service and attention to detail thro out you really are made to feel special. We chose what was a very cheaper end of the price list a nice shiraz worth about £6 in a UK supermarket but in at $128 dollars plus service and tax. Whole meal came in at just over $600 so not cheap by any means but none twisted my arm and both satifield it was grand evening. You are the given access to the lounge and bar that allows you nice views from the sky at the wonderful Singapore marina bay sights and what get a nice view of some of the150m skypool which for meal was one of the main reasons for the meal. So here is my only gripe and why not a 5 star rating, you pay $600+ and many more probaly over $1000 for a meal but out side of the resturant you are now clearly 2nd class and below because all the best viewing positions are reseved for teh hotel guests, not an issue in the fact that have paid a hefty $8/900 to stay but they could have at least left the area around the skybar and resturant viewing postion free for the diners who themselves have paid a fortune rather then let the guests who nare on the terrace free of charge to stand many yards in from of your best view point, it's not a Singapore thing it's an American Vegas money owner class system system surprised they don't fill the terrace with white spatted dark skinned butlers kissing butt.As for all else tonight was worthy of a 6 star ratin

Go for the food. Go for the atmosphere. But most of all go for Lily and Kavitha. Two of the nicest. And attentive waitresses you will EVER meet. Ihey mal ce la vie a night to remember.
4
The food was excellent, nice service, amazing view of Singapore! We had a good table at the edge, food was very good and we didn't have to wait for our food!
Greetings to Jeanni!

Great food and service. We had tasting menu which had an excellent range of dishes beautify cooked. The view of Singapore of course was a great hack drop.
3
Since we were staying in the Marina Bay Sands we booked this restaurant, then known as Ku De Ta. The food was exceptional and probably plated very well but where we were sitting it was too dark to see the meals. (They actually gave us reading lights for the menus!). We were seated at the back of the restaurant so had no real view, whereas those there just for a drink had the best views of all. We are unlikely to return
5
Went here whilst on honeymoon and had one of the best meals ever!! We were served by a girl call Rita who was absolutely fantastic. Recommended some of the dishes we had chosen and what a great choice from the starter to the desert. Definitely worth a visit even for a drink for the view!

Went CLV at rooftop of a hotel last Friday for company dinner as we had two guests. Food was ok but not great and for that kind of price, was too much to pay for snooty service. The evening went swiftly downhill starting from the first stop for cocktails at the bar.One of the guest ordered a beer instead of cocktails like the rest of us. Apparently the bartender deigned it below him to serve beer and ignored his order. Even after i tried to catch the bartender's attention by calling him by name, he pretended not to hear me.. Hey! I was standing right in front of him and there wasn't even a crowd yet! He finally acknowledged the order for the 3rd time but got someone else to fill the order. We brushed the incident aside as we didn't not want to dampen the mood for the evening.After drinks, we asked to be led to our reserved table but were told we had to go back to the front counter... And then the hostess led the whole group of us right back where we were at the bar area to be seated. =="Along the way, my young colleague was stopped by a hostess asking if she had a reservation. I promptly told her my colleague was with us.. Talk about snooty!There's more but shall not bore everyone with details..
2
I was at the hotel and was there for dinner. ( had to reserve a week before coming) the view on Singapore is great, but the food is way to expensive. Comparing to other hotels and even down town places it is just not worth it. I had a normal dinner for 300 sgd, if that is your budget than go ahea
5
We went up in a private elevator to this rooftop bar, there was no charge. We got seats near the edge which had spectacular views! Drinks / cocktails were similar price to rest of Singapore, therefore good value considering the location & views! People metres away on the viewing platform had paid to get to that level & there is no food or drink option! This was the highlight of our trip! Wonderful experience
4
Had watched Marina Bay Sands being constructed over the years and decided finally to spend a night there on my recent visit to Singapore, experience the infinity pool and dine on the 57th floor Skypark in Ce La Vi restaurant some 200 metres up. Had a great table on the edge looking out south towards the sea. Great atmosphere (apart from the smoke haze from Indonesia which restricted visibility to a mile or two). Tried the dinner tasting menu which was generally very good with some nice sashimi salad, octopus sashimi, crab maki, tuna tataki etc. Partnered with a Sauvignon Blanc at a price which was as elevated as the venue. Great ambience with tables not too close together and very good service. Definitely worth a one-off for the whole rooftop dining experience but expect to find a hole in your wallet afterwards. Prices similar to to SushiSamba in the Heron Tower in London but food not as good
1
They find the perfect recipe to spoil our lunch. The Ce La Vi is located on the last floor of the MarinaBay Sands Hotel. To get there even if you have a reservation for the restaurant, you have to queue to take the elevator with all the people who just when to have a look at the view. The outside terrace of the restaurant, there is no boundary between table for people having a drink or table for people having lunch. This is a expensive restaurant suppose to be exclusive and not a Mac Donald or a self service cheap kind of place. Each time the elevator arrive you have a wave of people finding they way around the table to the see the view, even encourage by the staff to do so! To make it even worst... they carry out the maintenance work at lunch time during your meal....SO I suggest you go there enjoy the view for free or have a drink but absolutely eat somewhere else
5
Had drinks and snacks for party of eight. Service from charming Lily was perfect along with her commentary on our surroundings. Prices are as high as the building but I would go back. Food OK, not great.
5
Fantastic meal, fantastic atmosphere with an amazing view! The service we received from Junaith was outstanding, we were made to feel very welcome and everything we ordered was delicious!
We will definitely be back when next in Singapore.
5
Only had drinks but you need to go here, pay over the odds for a beverage and the look at the view.
Decent cuban/latino music playing when we went as well. Always pleasant.
5
The service, ambience and view along with the food is spectacular , Great ambience very buzzy, and of course prices to match.
5
Love the atmosphere and this place will always be special for me for personal reasons. greta music and vibe.
5
On our first night in Singapore we decided that we would dine somewhere special and chose this amazing restaurant on the 57th floor of tower 3 at Marina Bay Sands.We where greeted and advised that it was a minimum $80 per person seating.We where shown to our table where the truly attentive and knowledgeable Ryan explained the dishes and wine selection.The ambiance of the restaurant was wonderful and truly set a remarkable standard for the rest of our trip. In retrospect we should have finished with this high note not started on it.The meals where presented beautifully and tasted divine.I have no hesitation in recommending this truly amazing experience
5
We decided to visit the Ce La Vi Bar in Singapore to have 1 or 2 drinks. We ended up staying over 3 hours. The view and vibe was great but the bartender named 'Nithi' made us some great custom creative cocktails while we had a great time at the bar. The view is amazing, but because of the great service and great cocktails and food its very worthwhile to take the effort and visit this bar
4
You go for the view, of course. But the food is excellent too. Had the duck breast which was done with "orange miso" and has a very refreshing aftertaste. Good selection of liquor and wines too. Service of course, as befitting such a location, was immaculate
4
Like the rest of Singapore, this beautiful venue suffers due to the impenetrable haze, though still very much worth a visit. Good staff, great wine list & cocktails, beautifully prepared food but just a few little issues! IMO if you have a booking and you are likely to be spending well in excess of $500+, being told that you will need to vacate your table 90 minutes after you arrive, this is a pretty ordinary way to kick things off! As always, I completely ignore this instruction, and nobody seems to care. Considering that the place was 25% full when we left, maybe they should skip this bit. Second issue was that I was presented with the same but wrong bottle of wine twice, with the definite implication being that I was making an error - easily sorted but very avoidable
5
The view is good on a non-hazy day. This evening the PSI reading was around 60 so visibility was limited to about 5km. The wine list is excellent. The food has a broadly Japanese-fusion that guarantees innovative and fresh dishes from start to finish. Sashimi octopus and fresh shellfish were highlights in the light bites. Tuna, halibut and scallops were the highlights of the mains. The desserts were all high in innovation
4
The food and drinks were very good. Not excellent but very good. So is the atmospere, view and service. It is worth the money even though it is rather expensive. We alwaay enjoy going there. Reservation required.
4
Service is good, esp. Vincent the filipino server who helped us out. Food is great, the salmon and spicy tuna roll is one of the best i ever had, also worth mentioning is their miso soup. Will come back to try other dishes nextime.
5
Went to this restaurant for a birthday lunch with my husband and 2 friends.
Food was so fantastic. Service was excellent, drinks were very good and wine list was extensive. Not a cheap meal but amazing food and extremely well presented. Service was faultless.
5
Cool lighting, cool music..........i have used "cool " twice in one sentence so shouldn't really have been there!!! .......but we were. Great views- just has to be done. Two drinks S$43 so come prepared, you are not just paying for the drink. Will go back.
4
Perfect setting for an awesome evening and happened to be on a saturday - run up to the singapore 50th celebrations, got an additional treat of the fireworks during the rehearsals. Food was great, portions delicate yet right, great wine list + pairing and would recommend end the evening at the night club bar, however if you're looking for a cigar with your malt to end the evening - need to buy it at the restaurant and have your server carry and cut it for you when you reach the smoking section of the night club, pretty impressive service
3
Let's be clear, if you go to Ce La Vi, you don't go for the food - you can find far better places in Singapore. You will get one of the trendiest place to go at the moment, offering uncomparable views over the city as well as the sea (when there is no haze), with a nice bar with good looking people.You can enjoy your dinner outside, but the sofa are not so comfortable to enjoy your dinner, and the music (with DJ) is quite loud if you want to enjoy any conversation with your friends.As for the food, I really enjoyed the crispy squid, and there was as well some salmon maki or sushi that was quite savoury. Pork belly was lacking some crisp & caramel, and bites were a bit too big. Deserts offered nothing to be thrilled.Wine list is extensive but everything is pricey, and by the glass is not really good (the spanish one).Service is Okelah...Good point is that you're just a few steps away from ex Kudeta Club :-
5
It is a great spot located right on top and the view is just beautiful from up there, the only downside is that there is no aircon, and it can get a little too humid and you start sweating too much after a while haha, but the music was great, so i had a good time 
5
We've been here several times in the past and I wrote a review on it earlier, but as our experience last night was again outstanding, they deserve to get another good review I thought. Absolutely delicious food, great atmosphere, very helpful staff and stunning desserts. Just a shame the bar wasn't open outstide because of the haze. So we dined inside too and again, as said, the food was amazing. You will not regret it if you eat here
4
Food was nice, a lot of fusion in there. We get to sit indoor but I think outdoor would be nicer if weather is not too bad. Minimum charge of 80SGD per head which I found reasonable for a restaurant in this location. Love the bar outside
3
We have been regular customers of this restaurant over the last 3 years during it's tenure formerly as Ku De Ta and now Ce La Vi. The service and food are generally excellent and we love dining there but on our first visit to the restaurant as Ce La Vi the bar service was terrible. We were served Gin and Tonic and had to return the drinks. The tonic was distributed from a mixer and was flat and watery. The staff graciously provided replacement drinks to which they had added extra gin but the tonic was no better. Surely a fine dining restaurant can provide bottled tonic water
5
Had a truly wonderful evening at the Sky bar and Restaurant last week!
The food was superb and the staff were professional in every respect!
Junaith was so accommodating and made our experience one to remember!!
2
the view is amazing, but the food is very average. It was what I would call poor pub food with an expensive price tag.
The wagyu burgers were really disappointing, bad quality.
5
What a delight. My boyfriend and I attended Ce La Vi Restaurant for our anniversary an could not have asked for a better experience. From the moment we arrived, the hostesses were brilliant, so cheerful and had us very excited for our meal. Having Farag as our waiter, the experience only got better! He explained how the restaurant meals worked, and was very helpful explaining what certain dishes contained. We did not have to wait more than a couple of minutes between drinks either which was fantastic, he was very tentative. The food is pricey, however is worth EVERY cent. The flavours were amazing and the presentation brilliant. It is a little splurge well worth it. Upon walking in, the hostess asked what the event was for, advising it was our anniversary we were treated with a surprise desert! If I could have ordered 3 more without rolling out of the restaurant I would have. Just made the night that much more special. The cocktails are also delicious!!!The view from the restaurant is fantastic, the height décor provide for a very romantic and luxurious evening. I would suggest requesting a balcony table outdoors like we did, this provided for an even better experience, being up so high, the heat didn't effect us
4
Food was amazing, very low lighting but that really added to the ambiance, service at the bar was shocking, 20 minutes to get served and there wasn't a queue just incompetence. But that didn't really spoil the evening, am adamant the chicken teriyaki was in fact pork belly, never ever had chicken that colour or with that texture before, but everything was newly cooked and presented and reasonable sized portions. We were inside so out of the wind but also away from the views. But outside is rammed with people hanging around the bar area so inside maybe a better choice
5
My experience was wonderful. I was created and given a table that had a view of the restaurant and the lounge. My server was Lily, she provided excellent recommendations on the menu. I was then greeted by her manager Jacquelyn. Both very pleasant people.I had the squid and ribeye, both excellent choices. To my pleasant surprise a complimentary dessert was prepared for me. Once again, top of the line.Later I was provided a table in the lounge deck area that once again, was incredible!Thanks again, I will be back
5
We were warmly welcomed and food was not so bad . Had a great dining experience at the top of Marina Bay Sands . Jenny was so great with her charming smiley welcome style and we were overwhelmed . Thanks Jenny for your great service

We had heard about this restaurant, so booked a table months early when we booked to stay at MBS. Due to a group booking, our booking couldn't be met, so had to be moved to the day before we wanted it, which was a little disappointing. On arrival, the restaurant was very busy, as it was just after the GP. Our initial table was between 2 groups of businessmen, who were very noisy & talking across us. We asked for another table, & were moved with no fuss to a more secluded table.We chose the F1 taster menu & flight of wines, which was a special menu only available for 2 weeks over the GP. It was lovely! The food was beautifully cooked & presented, & the wines were well matched & unusual. The service was faultless, & the somellier was lovely & very informative about her wines. 2 things have stopped me rating Ce La Vie as excellent. It is buzzy & chic, but it isn't secluded & exclusive as I expected. It was noisy & busy, & doesn't have booths or more private quieter dining areas. It is somewhere to go to be seen, & this wasn't what we expected. Don't go if you want an intimate dining experience, but do go if you want a buzzy, lively experience. Secondly, it was very dark. This does help enhance the astounding view, & the wait staff bring lights to attach to your menu so that you can actually read them. This is fine, but when your beautifully presented food arrives it is quite hard to see & doesn't do the food justice. Overall, we had a very nice, but very expensive meal, with amazing views, & great service, but we have had better complete dining experiences in the UK & we were a little disappointed having had very high expectations. It was also the most expensive meal we have had, coming in at about £400 total for the 12 courses & 1 Champagne 3 wines

But I won't kid you, this is an expensive place to club. There are more expats here than locals. For the average Singaporean, this is very expensive. After all, you're paying for a premium experience. If you wanna be on top of the city district of singapore, then this is definitely your place. Day or night, you will get to see the amazing buildings and urban jungle that makes singapore from a bird's-eye view (more like helicopters eyes, since it is 57 storeys above ground) Cheapest item on the menu is probably bottled water, but I don't remember seeing anything remotely less than $10.If you cannot take alcohol, have a fresh young Thai coconut at $10 as you admire the skyline! There are juices too. I would choose coming here over the sky Park as it is cheaper, you get a drink and you also get to see almost the same thing- unless you're a photographer.
5
Recently I was lucky enough to visit Ce La Vi for dinner.i had visited last year and loved it so much ,my husband got sick of hearing about it,so this time i had to take him.We started the night with some amazing cocktails at the outside Bar ,then dined outside also ,which was so nice as you get a bit of a breeze.Our waiter was fantastic and he made plenty of great recommendations(,Ulygsis ,Thankyou again..)The food is sharing style and we enjoyed many dishes.We both love seafood and they do that superbly.The wine list great also ,and we enjoyed some really lovely wines .The Somelier is great and super funny.My husband now sees why I was raving so much about Ce La Vie ,and he is now telling everyone about it
5
My partner and I were staying at Marina Bay Sand and had been told to have dinner at Ce La Vi Restaurant. We had an amazing experience and would definately be dining there again. The food was amazing and the staff were very welcoming and beautiful. Our waitress Rita was lovely and helped us with our menu choices and provided us with an exceptional experience. She was very friendly and attended to our every need. She definately made our experience at Ce La Vi one that we will always remember
4
We had breakfast here using our luxury escapes voucher. We didn't get to see the full menu we had a limited one to choose from. While the staff were friendly some of them struggled to understand English. Nice spot to dine on the beach.
5
We dined here last night and everything was perfect, the venue, the food and our waitress Rita really looked after Us With her service
4
My husband and I dined here for our honeymoon. The service was impeccable. I wanted to organise an evening where we splurged and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The food was fantastic, however, due to high expectations, we felt the food was slightly underwhelming. The Japanese food was indeed delicious, but not particularly memorable. For $400... could've probably had a nicer meal somewhere else without the views. We can appreciate it was a special occasion and we definitely wanted it to be somewhere memorable, but wouldn't dine here again if we visit Singapore
5
We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and were able to get a reservation at the CE LA VI restaurant on our last night in Singapore and it topped off a great holiday. The restaurant is on the top of Marina Bay Sands which gives you a sensational view of Singapore and the food selection and quality is perfect. The staff are always there to help and go out of heir way to make you have an unbelievable experience. It was also our anniversary and they added to the night. Highly recommended
4
I had dinner with my family here on September 16, 2015. We were running late due to the F1 Formula race traffic. We arrived an hour late and were still able to get a table immediately. They were very accommodating. We really wanted a table that would give us a better view of the city. Thanks to the manager Junaith, he really made it happened. The food was delicious. Thanks for making my last night in Singapore wonderful.P.S- Please tell your taxi driver to drop you off on the hotel side not the casino side. It will save you a long walk
3
Dinner for two. Arrived at restaurant 8.30 for 9pm... All good. Ordered food which then did not arrive until 10.25pm. Two dishes were missing. But before the food arrived we were advised the kitchen closed at 10.30 and would we like to order more... Difficult decision as we had not yet had our main dishes. Front of house staff superb and coping with a incapable and incompetent kitchen. Just some history ...previously known as Ku De Ta when this first opened it had the same issue...hopeless delivery from the kitchen. This improved over the years but it has taken a huge step backwards.The food... When it arrived we could not fault it... Well cooked and excellent (the dishes that arrived!). Front of house staff... Excellent and just apologetic and embarrassed about the kitchen.Herein lies the issue... Marina bay sands is a huge setup... They cater for the high rollers and clients like us who spend a menial sgd500 just are not important to them... It won't make a difference to numbers if we leave unhappy... This contrasts to other small restaurants where guests count and are not just numbers.So go if you want spectacular views, happy to spend 500 on food that takes hours to arrive... But is ok when it does. Our advice is to make a huge fuss if your food takes longer than 30 minutes... We didn't and maybe this was our mistake, however not what you want to do for a romantic eveningWe tackled the manager... Was useless, just said sorry ... Very busy... Free deserts... We don't want free food just good serviceThe venue is unique... But 1-altitude is higher and the service is better. Would we go again... Have to say yes but we would certainly make a bigger issue if the food failed to arrive
4
Lunch was excellent and service exceptional, thanks to Rita (delightful). Food was a unique fusion of flavours, albeit a little lacking in spice (personal taste), and the squid starter was one of the best we have ever tasted. Our only disappointment is that, given the prices they charge for quality food and service, they allow a very poor dress code at lunch time. Seated next to us was a man in a singlet, shorts, tattoos, and wife in singlet with bra on show. NOT GOOD FORM for a restaurant of this calibre, profit over standards I believe. Besides this aspect it was an excellent restaurant and well worth it. Of course the view on a nice day is exceptional
5
Incredible view, great atmosphere and the food is very good. Must order the prawn salad, sushi also great, and the US beef was awesome.Service also really good, Ana was very kind and efficient. Next to the Restaurant there is a club that you can join afterwards. Very expensive, but worths the experience
5
Went here last night and really enjoyed the place. We were sat inside although the sides are open so you get a decent breeze coming through. The atmos is a modern dance music beat from the sky bar with quite a buzzy feel due to the talking both from the restaurant and the bar. It feel like a popular place for people to meet. The decor is that dark wood oriental theme and lights are needed to read the menus which gives you an idea of the amount of light on offer and being 57 floors up also gives great views across Singapore. All in all a great place to have dinner. We had cocktails (vesper and White Russian) and then edamame, sticky squid and crab roll for starters. The edamame came up warm which was nice, the squid was lightly battered with an excellent honey soya and the crab roll was large and include salmon roe and wasabi. If I was being hyper critical the size of the soft shell crab roll made it difficult to eat in a single bite and it fell apart a bit but it was excellent in taste. The Vesper went really well with the crab. For mains we had the grilled halibut and the chicken teriyaki. The fish was perfectly cooked with lotus on top and a single pepper to the side. Luckily my wife order some noodles which we shared as it was great on its own but needed noodles to complete the dish. Same goes for the teriyaki, well cooked with good tasting teriyaki sauce but needed rice/noodles to make it a complete dish. I also order a glass of NZ Sauvignon Blanc which complimented the fish superbly. For afters we had the strawberry shiso meringue and the goma cake. Both presented well. The goma cake was light with interesting flavours that complimented the ganaches well. The strawberries were set in a jelly with light sorbet and cream which was all delicately balanced. We finished with and Ameretto and a Baileys. All this came in at $400 Singapore. This was a lot of money but we spent over $120 on drink alone. The only real gripe on cost is spending $48 on a main course and still needing to order sides to make it into a complete dish. However regardless of this the service was great, the food was great, the atmosphere was great and this was the best start to out F1 weekend in Singapore. I would go again.

Came for lunch with the family and had an amazing meal for prices that werent cheap but given the setting were still pretty good. Setting was amazing!! Loved that they had a kids menu. Only reason I didnt give a 5 was because we felt a little uncomfortable with the kids, it was such a quiet, chilled atmosphere we were worried the kids might ruin it lol.
5
Not the best restaurant that for sure but price is reasonable as you pay for the setting and the view. The service was top class from Junarih who look after our table and was delivering a sincere and top class service!
4
As the title suggests, two things really stand out: Beautiful view and great service. Our waitress (Pita) was really attentive to our needs. But unfortunately the food didn't match .
5
My second visit to Ce La Vi with my wife and family visitors from Australia on Saturday night. Whilst the smoke haze took away the impact of the view, once again the restaurant served up unique dishes with presentation, taste and service to match the best anywhere.We took a later sitting this time so as not to feel rushed and I certainly recommend that over taking an earlier sitting. We did book a month ahead to ensure we got that preference especially for a Saturday night
3
We only had a drink here after visiting the top of the hotel. The view from the restaurant was great but the service was terrible! my and my partner ordered drinks and felt rushed to get out! We were given the bill right after the drinks came and were asked to pay there and then! We said we haven't finished and might order more.... but the waiter still kept hovering around us
4
I took my husband here for his 30th birthday and it was a beautiful fun and buzzy setting complimented with free champagne and a lovely cake but I was disappointed with the food a little. It was extremely expensive and while some of the dishes reflected this others were very bland with the vegetable tempura like deep friend mulch and the duck very overcooked. If you're looking for a special setting this is one of the best places in Singapore and cocktails before dinner at sky bar are a must.If you want top food as well this is not the place for you.
5
This is a truly a spectacular location in an unbelievably unique structure.I'll start by saying I was first attracted by iconic nature of the building housing this restaurant, but was even more blown away by the kind and friendly hospitality we received when we arrived there. We were greeted with a genuinely warm reception by their guest relations manager, Raquel, and after some welcoming introductions, my wife and I proceeded to the bar area for pre dinner drinks. We used the time to socialize with other guests there, and take in the awesome scenery from our perch high up in the Singaporean sky.In reasonable time we were informed that our table was ready, and were led to our table in a more secluded romantic area, again with fantastic open air views of the city.We were then served by Ken, a youthful, knowledgeable, warm and friendly server, who in addition to serving us efficiently, was able to take the time to patiently talk to us, answering the many questions we had about his city. After dinner we were lucky enough to given a personal tour of the facility by Raquel in what easily turned out to be the highlight of our visit.Needless to say, if we are ever back in Singapore, Ce La Vie would be one of the first places i'd return to for dinner, the ambiance, and hospitality
5
We planned on going here knowing it would run us a few bob, but it is Singapore & it is the Marina Bay Sands. The food was quite lovely & all served promptly & our hostess was quite attentive. After dinner we headed on to the deck for drinks & to take in the view. All in all, a wonderful experience

This was to be the treat of our SGP visit and we were not disappointed.The food was fantastic, the service impeccable and by luck we had booked on the clearest night of our stay so the views were amazing.It is without doubt expensive for us mere mortals but for a special occasion we were happy to pay.If we had a gripe it is that there is a lot of effort put in to making sure you don't get any access to areas you haven't paid for (eg the observation deck) which seemed OTT for the money we had paid

My fiancÃ©e and I visited Ce La to celebrate her birthday on 9 September. The service we received throughout was fantastic, especially from Rita, who was the waitress responsible for our table/the area in which we were seated.The food was very tasty, and there was a good variety. Given the calibre of the restaurant, and the location, I thought the prices were reasonable. Our bill came to approximately SGD 280 for two. I will definitely come back here to celebrate special occasions in the future :

I last dined here three years ago (when it was Ku De Ta); and glad I made the visit back. This is fine dining at its best; and in a relaxed setting. Our waiter Faisal is to be commended - we were celebrating a wedding anniversary and Faisal and his team made it a very special night. The Mango-passion & Fromage Blanc and Chocolate Fondant should not be missed. The Roast Duck Breast dish was one of the most succulent and flavoursome I've had in South East Asia (or anywhere home in Australia)... We'll all be back on our next visit to Singapore

had a great meal, especially enjoyed the octopus sashimi and the pork cheek. Excellent service from Rita. Terrific views of the city, as located at the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel.

One of the best food what i ever had. I oder couple of dishes I really enjoyed. My friend too . Thanks for your Good service.

Exceptional and world class cuisine. Attentive service. My only reservation was that the overall level of noise and music detracted from what was offered on the plate.

Of course this location has it all! Beautiful view both on city and sea. A nice bar to start the evening out. Food & wines are quite expensive but not bad. Service is clearly trained to push sales of bottles. In our case a supplier invited us. When the waiter came and suggested a bottle of champagne our host could difficult refuse in front of just guests. We enjoyed a meal of small portions, nice food and had a fantastic evening.Recommended for outside dining. You will not regret is but you must be aware that you pay for the fantastic location

Visited here during a warm Singapore day to catch the legendary views across the impressive city skyline. At the very top of Marina Bay Sands! This is the recommended way to get the view And enjoy a drink. It was late afternoon when we arrived and the place was dishevelled and in the midst of setting up for that evening's main event. We expected the views from Ce lA vIe to be diminished by the haze from the Sumatra bushfires but not for the service to be so lacklustre and dismissive. As with many tourist traps, prices are high, service is poor and food & drinks average. Of course a visit at night when it is more of a nightclub than lounge with the lights of Singapore might be a much more exciting option but it seems you need to book into the parties at night. For a quick gawk at the view and a peek into the lives of the hotel guests in the roof top pool next door, Ce La View is worth the visit but I wouldn't plan to stay too long.
5
Book early as this place was difficult to get into. It's very popular not only within the hotel but with Singapore locals too.This place is expensive so not a day to day eatery for my budget but well worth it for a treat.The staff were amazing and even gave my partner a KU DE TA handbag hook for the table as a gift. The food was great and the serving sizes were actually ok for such a high end restaurant.The ambience is the big seller for the restaurant although a little dark it felt very chic and relaxing.Overall, worth the stretch, you're on holidays, you work hard, you deserve it :

This restaurant was highly recommended to us. However, the waiting staff soured the experience. The service felt be-grudging rather than engaging. Our first drinks order took 30 minutes to arrive (after asking three times for these to be hurried up). For these prices, we should not be expected to lick our forks clean between courses and its not unreasonable to expect a spoon to delivered with soup. The starters were excellent and the main courses were adequate. The dessert menu was thrown at us and had to be requested (unexpected as we had a 2hr booking slot). For a restaurant of this calibre, we expected much better service and training from the waiting staff. Overall, it was an unsavoury experience
5
Good view from 57th floor Marina Bay Sand. You can see Gardens by the Bay, F1 circuit, Singapore Flyer etc. First I only drink in outdoor area and seat share with other people , and we enjoy the view. And we lunch (late lunch) in indoor area. The food is good, the restaurant is good. Friendly staffs . The sunset view is very good. The price is so so, not cheap but not too expensive. Very recommended. Me and my husband love this restaurant .
5
I must admit that I was not totally impressed by the food but this was compensated by the great view and fantastic service. Our waitress Lily was wonderful and managed to "sell" me a different plate than the one I ordered. Instead of John Dory I got a seared Tuna steak, all served with a smile and good sense of humou
5
Great food, amazing cocktails and breathtaking views. I can't say enough about the staff. They were there for us with every request.We celebrated my girlfriends birthday and the staff presented us with a beautiful cake topped with a "Happy Birthday" message. I would like to say a special thank you to the assistant manager Junith for all of his preperations. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to top their visit to Singapore.

Very good view of singapore and the food is a good asian european fusion food excellent taste n good sevice
5
Beautiful Dining environment. Our waitress, Rita was perfect. 5/5 on service and food! The view is amazing as well. Would definitely recommend
5
Nice evening together and ordered few small platters to share. They got us a table at the window after all so even better.
Rita is a great waitress and really surprised us with a special desert!

While our stay at Marina Bay Sands, my wife and I decided to go up to Ce La Vi for a drink. we have been told that we must try the Singapore sling. After seeing the bill which I think was almost $30 per cocktail.... I expected the cocktail to be delicious, fruity and tasty..... Unfortunately I was disappointed and after what I paid for it, I was even more disappointed.I suggest you go up early because all the seats outside where the view is.... 95% of the time are taken. We had to sit an eat inside which we were told we can't stay long as all the tables were reserved.... even though for the 30min + we were there.... not one person was coming inside.If you are staying at Singapore, then this place is recommended for a quick drink... otherwise... probably better places outside for a drink which you will not be paying double or triple for just a view...
5
Celebrating a birthday in this restaurant was certainly no mistake, as we were treated to a great dining experience with a fine spread of carefully prepared dishes, accompanied by attentive and caring staff. View would have been spectacular if not for the haze (at no fault of the restaurant). Definitely worth going even just for the experienc
5
Great Food, every dish is a statement of greatness. Details is given from the perspective of smell, taste, sight and feeling. The freshness of the ingredients speaks for itself in each dish. all the flavors are great by themselves. Especially the Lava Cake served for desert. Impeccable service . All Staff are very friendly especially staff Lily. She was so sweet and made us to feel so comfortable helped us to choose the right Menu for our dinner.I appreciate that thoughts are put into every details the moment you step into right till the moment you leave with utmost satisfaction
5
I dined for lunch at the Ce La Vi on top of the stunning Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore while on a stopover returning from Europe. If you're in Singapore for a short time a meal at the Ce La Vi with the view over Singapore is a must. The food was excellent, I had an exquisite John Dory dish, good wine and excellent service. I sat overlooking the new botanical gardens and the ocean. Spectacular
4
Excellent food and views, you can't get a better view for dinner in Singapore. You'd normally have to book at least a week ahead to ensure you get a table.The food was really excellent, but the wine list limited and very expensive, if you can consider drinking beer which is still reasonable. The bar outside is always busy, as is the deck below which you have to pay to get access to. The view over the Garden Bay is just fantastic, as are all the boats waiting to get into harbour.Top spo
5
Surprisingly excellent food at affordable prices by Melbourne city standards despite the astonishing location. On the other hand, insanely overpriced winelist - which is a Singapore-wide problem. Most wines appeared to have a 700% markup. Cocktails probably better value! Amazing views. Given the wow factor of the location and the terrific food would definitely recommend
5
Ambience was top notch - dining while overlooking the city skyline is an amazing experience to have. Coupled with the lighting and the music, it felt so cosy and homely.Service was excellent - all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We were served by Rita, who knew the menu by heart and explained all the dishes carefully. She really made sure that we were enjoying our dinner.Food was already great, and the experience just made it even better
5
Dropped by for lunch and to check the view. Great service from Ken our waiter. A must do in Singapore
4
great place , good meal great time there.
the quail and the duck were really good.
pricy but what a location...
5
Dined twice in this establishment and all I can say is that it worth every dollar spent
Food is great from the selection of ingredients to the execution
Service is attentive and prompt - very professional
Ambience - Top notch

Visited to see the fantastic view from the restaurant and had a nice cocktail on arrival. Pleasant staff who didn't push or hurry you along

Hi Carla and the SomilierThis is for you guys, we already know the chef is as good as it gets, joking, better.From the moment i stepped up to be received my journey was more than i expected.Just to note guys i have a little experience having run hotels and restaurants, my wife is a chef, daughter maitre de of a 6 star restaurant and both sons cooks. So you can imagine what demands there is at meal times.Carla you keen observation on how my journey was progressing was not intrusive however timely, your knowledge of what i requested was to say the least almost as good as the food in the way you described each serving pausing with effect. Only 2 issues you kept trying to get the menu but it was fun each time and the gentle way you explsined that the restaurant did not serve any breads, I almost chocked holding back laughter at myself for being a dill, well done.Mr Somilier, we didn't share names, my only disappointment was that we weren't introduced at the beginning of the meal as once I relinquished control to you the journey went to a higher level.I have to say the escort of the two ladies from the restaurant staff in the lift down considering they kept using my name, the rest of the people must have thought i was special, yes my wife does but for completely different reasons. I think it was a coincidence but hey it was fun42 years many countries countless restaurants you guys are the best.Well done.Pau

Ok let's just start by addressing the view. Phenomenonal! Get there early and have a drink at the bar so you can take it all in. The restaurant itself is superb. Foodie heaven. Staff were attentive and friendly. The Restaurant Operations Mgr, Hira Mokomoko, was one of the best I've come across. Thoroughly enjoyed everything about dining here. Be aware that you are paying for a completely immersive experience though - it's not cheap, but we'll worth it
5
My girlfriend and i visited this restaurant last month as our hotel concierge told us about ce la vi. Food, service and drinks were all really good. Im such a snob when it comes to service. Our server Jaquelyn had vast knowledge of the food and drinks, she came to check on our table at very comfortable frequency. My friend and i had lots to catch up on. Jaquelyn made sure to not intrude our dinner. Expensive yes but reasonable for what service we received. Weve enjoy the night as she handled us professionally throughout.Thank you jaquelyn for looking after us. We shall come back

Was there for dinner and a birthday celebration. They exceeded my expectations as they remembered my special request for a chocolate molten cake with Happy birthday written on it. I tot that they needed me to place an order after our main so i requested for the menu,, and before I know it, they presented the dessert and caught both of us by surprise! Prompt service and really polite waitress. Please keep up the great service! :) The black cod was great and dessert was amazing! There were a few misses but the experience made up for that.. I will be back to try all the amazing desserts

Personally the reason for picking up this restaurant was the views that it was supposed to offer. Unfortunately from that aspect the choice was a disappointment. Unless you are seated in the first row by the terrace you don't really get to see much (and those tables are not many, I would say a 10% of all the available tables overall).Something else which is important to take into consideration regarding the views is that from the Singapore's skyline side is not visible by the restaurant. It is though by the Skyline bar that is situated in the same place and it is usually packed. Now, in terms of the service, it was of very good quality as you would expect for the price you pay. The food was also very good and tasty, nevertheless you can get the same quality and taste in many other restaurants at a third of the price.We dined 2 adults and 2 little kids (3 & 5 years old), we took 1 salad, 2 plates of sushi, 2 main plates (1 with chicken and 1 with roasted duck) and 1 bottle of white wine (the cheapest we found which costed 90S$) and we paid in total 350S$, that is approx. 235 euros. So bottom line: if your first priority is to enjoy the views while having a nice dinner think again because you're not going to get it and still you will pay a big amount of money
5
Due to some legal rangle, now called C'est la vie, but still wonderful. Up in the clouds, with a view that is sublime, this restaurant gives service unparalleled and food that will linger in your memory for quite some time. You can drink at the bar, overlooking the bay, or dine at a table with an ocean view, away down there.
4
Delicious food, super amazing views and and excellent and kind staff. I was attended by Jess. Super cool and kind waitress. It was a nice experience.
5
Could not have chosen a better location for the first night of our holiday. Amazing view, great food and a buzzy, clubby but friendly vibe. A must visit.
4
the view is brilliant. Some staff were also, some were not. Could not describe the welcome as friendly. Food excellent
3
We booked this meal as a special one for our final night. we asked for an outdoor table and this is what we got, but it was very noisy and dark. the view was hidden by bushes and the cushioned seats very uncomfortable ton eat on. The food was expensive and not exceptional; small portions and not a huge menu. the cocktails were good. Unlikely to visit again
5
This is my 2nd visit to Ce La Vi with overseas visitors in as many months. Both times, the food and service were excellent. The views are of course, what you pay a premium for, but worth every cent in my opinion! On 26/8/15, Lily was our service attendant. She has an amazing memory! We ordered 10 different dishes to share (best way to get a taste of everything!) and she could repeat the order even though I'd forgotten a couple! My guests asked for a Cosmopolitan cocktail (made famous by the ladies in "Sex and the City" I was told) and Lily, although in her early 20's, knew exactly what it was! The Iberico pork cheek and beef tenderloin stood out for me - tender, succulent, cooked to perfection! All the other dishes were great too, but these two had us going "oh wow!" We sat outdoors and it was lovely and breezy, and overlooked the Gardens By The Bay.Plus points: view, Lily the Amazing, food, great place to impress tourists and business clients.Minus points: our reservation was for 7pm. Lily apologetically advised that we had to vacate by 9.15pm, when we were about to order our dessert at 9pm! This was a Wednesday, so either they are very popular (but I saw empty tables inside and no queue) or, they are just following orders to the letter T! After we had ordered dessert and coffee, Lily came back to say that it was ok for us to stay as long as we liked! I won't consider this a minus, but the restaurant is on the expensive side, but hey! you pay for the venue and the views!I will be back next month, with a different group of visitors as I know they will be suitably impressed

Decided to give a friend a treat at CELAVIThe place was quite full during weekday at lunchtime.Do remember to make a reservation at the link here:http://www.celavi.com/reservations/We both had the 3-Course Lunch Tasting Menu total cost for 2 of us was 112.95 Singapore Dollars.Pre-StarterHeirloom Tomato Salad.There was an obvious black blemish on the tomato, which was replaced by our server Lily. I felt it should not have made it to the table.StarterGrilled Prawns with Baby Spinach.Fantastic Dish, the grated cheese and fried yam combine with the salad to create a wonderful experience of tastes and textures.StarterCrispy Sticky Baby SquidSweetness of the sauce was balanced well with the taste of spices. Good!Main CourseNorwegian Salmon roasted over charcoal, with Chinese date, sakÃ©, yamasa shoyu.Dish was served with wok fried vegetables and organic rice from northern Japan.Tasty dish, salmon was very juicy and tender, not dry at all. The presentation could have been better, the light blue plate that the dish was served on looked out of place. Main CourseChicken Schnitzel with dipping sauce and pickled cucumber.Dish was served with wok fried vegetables and organic rice from northern Japan.The dish was well-cooked, aroma of the cheese was delightful. Sauce went well with the chicken. Have to criticise the presentation of the dish, it looks very underwhelming and not photogenic at all.DessertChocolate Fondant with Vanilla Ice CreamThe highlight of the set lunch. Done to perfection, divine. The creamy fondant filling, sweet, tart flavors of the mixed berries and vanilla icecream make for a wonderful dessert.Had a walk around the restaurant, and we could see moldy surfaces growing in pools of water when looking over the parapet near the bar area, really quite a turnoff.The booth seat we were given also had unsightly stains at the corner joining the wall and our seat itself, really hope that these things would not be visible during meal-time.Would like to compliment our server Lily, who provided out the flawless service that was prompt and discreet. Bravo

We started out with a drink at the bar and then moved on to dinner. Our table was outside right on the edge with fantastic views out to the bay (try and get this rather than sitting inside). The service was spot on and the food was excellent. It's an expensive night out but well worth it for a special occasion. Booking is essential
5
I only ate the snack bar menu which was absolutely delicious so if that is anything to by you will leave satisfied. I had the waygu beef pizza which was soooo good, the calamari tubes crispy tender how they should be. Highly recommend to eat there
5
One of the best meals I've ever had. The food was cooked to perfection, the setting is phenomenal with breathtaking night time views of the Singapore skyline and our wonderful waitress, Rita, did a fantastic job of looking after us, which made our evening all the better so thank you so much! I highly recommend it!
5
Our family (2 teens) had a fantastic dinner! We had several sushi/sashimi dishes and drinks. Service and food were fantastic! View from top of Marina Bay Sands can not be beat! Only knock is that it was very expensive. Easy to meet the per person minimum spend
5
I want to CA LA VI whit my boyfriend on July 19, 2015. Good dinner
and very romantic. Best service. Thank you. This a good top roof in Singapore and Marina Bay Sands
5
Great drinks, atmosphere and ambiance. Fun place to hang out with friends and enjoy the panoramic views. Great service!
4
Ce La Vi (formerly Cu De Ta) offers fine dining at great altitude. I've visited twice now and foods are really very good.
5
After swimming, we went to this restaurant for lunch. The most thing I would like to comment is the service. There was a korean sever who served us really well. She recommended which dishes we would fit on our taste and all dishes were satisfactory. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food

This the old Ku De Ta restaurant at the top of Marina Bay Sands has adopted a new name, Ce La Vi, but with basically the same top quality menu offerings and of course glorious view. I've been there several times before before they changed their name - always a good place for personal and business meals, albeit on the pricey side.This time I took my daughter for her 21st birthday dinner, and we got a great table outside but on the side with a great view of the Marina gardens by the bay and Marina bay golf. Service was great, with PJ our server always attentive and responsive to all our queries, with suggestions on our options. We started with the pork belly lollipop, spicy sashimi salad (without crab due allergies) and fried salmon skin salad. Our mains, also shared, included rack of lamb (succulent and delicious), seared salmon and fried pork belly, with shiso fried rice and organic Japanese rice on the side. We had a very nice New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, and ended with a sorbet pallet cleanser. Then the restaurant surprised us with a nice chocolate pudding birthday treat for my daugther with a little sparkling candle, a nice touch to a lovely evening
5
Just returned from an amazing birthday evening at Ce La Vi. My wife booked around a month ago but we only mentioned my birthday at the front desk. We were shown to what must have been one of the best tables, overlooking the skyline, given great personal service and enjoyed a wonderful meal. All topped off with a Happy Birthday surprise (to both of us) dessert. We began with drinks at the sky bar, a cocktail and beer overlooking Singapore from the 57th floor. Quite expensive yes, and maybe we were lucky, but I would thoroughly recommend the whole experience. Thank you to all at Ce La V
5
Went with my friend and husband, went during the daytime with great sunshine and views of city 360. enjoyed cocktails (expensive but worth it, you pay for view) we spent a few hrs here, took photos (can get great panoramic shots) and then continued our day. fun for a mid-day break on a weekend. good pit stop to take your friends who are visiting SGP. the dress code is 'smart casual' :)
5
How does it feel to eat the best food and drink the best drinks in the world on the 57th floors into the sky? Answer: Amazing!!I have never been so excited to go to a restaurant in my life! It is the most beautiful restaurant and the views of Singapore, are to die for!!The Guest Services Executive, Jacquelyn Sena Sunderarajo, came around and asked us about how I meal was going but also joked around with us like we had been patrons of the restaurant for years. Making us feel special and that we were old friends catching up.Our waitress, Jess, was wonderful. We joked around with her also and she would tell us some tips about Singapore, told us about the Cé La Vi Restaurant and how it is to work in such an amazing restaurant.In the end, we went outside and got pictures of the stunning view and enjoyed watching life go by.Thank you so much Cé La Vi Restaurant for such an amazing experience that I will never forget. Special thanks to Jess & Jacquelyn for making the experience special and for giving me the CD!By the way, when you go to Cé La Vi, pick the Strawberry-Shiso Meringue and the Chocolate Fondant for desert. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.Forget everything you want to do in Singapore and make this the #1 on your list
5
I loved Ce la Vi which has an excellent locations, view was amazing overlooking of singapore. Food is superb, a must try spicy tuna roll, sashimi salad, baby squid and tuna fish. You can get all what you wanted at this restaurant food, ambience live music. As well as attentive and pleasant staff like Jaquelyn she got a good sense of humour she made us laugh no matter how busy is she, she always check on us if we are ok if there is anything else we would like, it feels like we are home a 5star service from her
4
Had an absolutely beautiful meal, however it could easily have been destroyed by the table who had two toddlers who were running around our table, playing with the ice bucked, shining the menu torches around.We luckily noticed the table were finishing their meal, so we did not order anything until they had left the restaurant.Our booking was for 8pm. I don't mind children, but this is not a child friendly restaurant, particularly at 8pm.I think management need to look at this issue
4
There is no better view in singapore. The bar is hopping the music is good and so is the food and service.Not cheap but a must do when in Singapore
4
Great spot to eat and watch the light show at Marina Bay Sands. Meals a bit on the expensive side but on par with other restaurants in the area. Service and foot was very good.
4
The food was very great and of course the view was terrific. For some reason our table had a very stupid uncomfortable couch/bench like thing. Not appropriate for dinner. Also the the ambiance started out lovely, but as the night progressed there was terrible music blaring out of the speakers and we had to yell at each other.The service was pretty good. It would be nice if after spending the required $80 min per person you got some complimentary Skypark passes

I chose Cé La Vi to celebrate my husband's birthday this year.Food left us in awe and service was extremely great! With personal service staff to tend over us was an awesome experience. However, i have made the reservation with a note to have a birthday dessert surprise for my husband to be served after dinner. To my surprise, what was served for dessert was an utter disappointment with only a meager candle and a white chocolate that says happy birthday. Initially, my reservation was at 630pm but i had called earlier to change it to 7pm instead. During the call, i spoke to reservations and requested for a surprise. When the birthday dessert was served, it led me to shame as the other patrons had a really nice dessert with the word happy birthday piped on a plate whereas my surprise really came as a surprise. My husband did no doubt enjoy the dinner very much, but it felt like nothing was pre-arranged for his birthday.I thank Cé La Vi for the wonderful dining experience but it did leave a strong impression to me that i should personally make a trip down beforehand to arrange for something special in future if I'm back for another great occasion
3
It's on the top of sky park resort. The restaurant is very elegant and suited for a romantic dinner. Food is very good, but there are two caveats. The minimum is 80$ each, regardless of what you eat. Some tables are far from windows, and if you sit there it's just a waste of money, as there are much better and cheaper restaurant in this case. Book in advance and ask for a table with a panorama
5
I chose the Restaurant for my husbands birthday and we can absolutely recommend! The view was breathtaking, the service excellent (thanks Ali and colleagues!) and the food delicious! On the top, the restaurant surprised with a free delicious birthday dessert and a congratulations labeled dessert as it was also our honeymoon! Choose the white sangria, very tasty!Also quite expensive but a must go
5
We made a booking a week prior and the reservations team were so prompt and great to deal with. We had drinks at this bar at 6pm and dinner at 7pm. We brought our 3 year old with us staff were lovely and attentive, and the food - we LOVED it. Sushi, sushi and more high quality sushi. The view - you cannot beat it! An absolute must if you're in Singapore.
4
The real reason for choosing this restaurant was to get on top for the view of Singapore from an amazing building. The service and food was a bonus. Five friends had a really interesting lunch and cocktails. Four of us chose the set menu chefs choice lunch and as one of us was a vegetarian, she chose a couple of items from the a la carte menu every to suit her tastes. We all had a great time sampling the food as it arrived. The tastes were interesting and at times unexpected. Desserts in Singapore, on the whole are big on looks and high on sweetness, but the dessert we had here was big on looks and high on interesting taste explosions. Smears and spots of high intensity flavours combined to make a memorable dessert. Not one I would necessarily order again but worth the experience to taste. The restaurant is getting a little tired looking as far as seating and ambiance go, it's in need of a makeover. Considering the high prices you pay I think this is overdue.But so worth the spectacular view. Recommend a walk in the bay gardens afterwards

i love this place, perched high over the rest. Having dinner here had always been something i look forward to. Ambience is top notched, and needs no elaborating. Food wise, i have many personal favorites. 1. Assorted Vegetable Tempura is my no1. bloody good!! thin and crispy crust. one of the better ones i have tasted.2. Spicy Tuna Roll is another favorite. Tasty and no too heavy, great for light bites. 3. Seared Maguro Tuna Tataki - good as well. 4. Shiso Flower Fried Rice - tiny bowl of fragant rice makes a perfect sharing dish. 5. Braised Iberico Pork Cheeks - tender and melts in the mouth. Then wash down all the good food with desserts and wine! Viola! picture perfect! :
5
This restaurant was amazing the food, view and ambiance. There's was a DJ as well which make people dance with the music,I was so impressed with this restaurant and definitely will tell my friends when we go home to Australia. Nothing much to say we enjoy the entire dinner. This is my first writing a review here as I really want to say good things about Ce La Vi Singapore. And I would like to take this opportunity to make a note of exceptional service we receive from one of your staff Jaquelyn, her service and attention to detail is among some of the finest we had seen and we travel a lot. She provided us all with beyond exceptional service. Jaquelyn attended to our every need efficient and with good humour, her communication skills and personable nature made us feel right as home. You are fortunate to have her on your staff and we feel she should be commended for her excellent customer service. Best wishes to your team at ce la vi singapore..

Affords a nice night time view of the Marina Bay area. There is music and a dance floor for those so inclined. We had a couple of drinks and took a look. Cannot comment on the food as we didn't have dinner.
4
I visited again in July,not only has the name changed but also the ability to view both sides unless you are dining. ( min spend 80 sing dollars).
Great atmosphere.Cocktails 26 dollars plus tax etc.
ps. access is from Tower 3.
5
The views alone are worth it. It is expensive, but the food is very good and the service was very fast. We were there during the National Day weekend and it still was run well.
5
we spent a romantic dinner with a great view over singapore. the food was excellent and the staff very friendly. especially our waitress Rita, who served us very attentively and made our stay at the cé la vi very comfortable.
5
A fantastic evening. It fills quickly, so make sure you get there early and stake a good table with a view. Reservations mandatory.
5
Amazing restaurant. Amazing food. Amazing location. Loved it. Expensive but completely worth it! Cost was £600 for a 5 course meak with cocktails and wine for 4

I dined here with my boyfriend on Saturday night and had a lovely time. I booked the day before and we managed to get a table at 9:45. At first we were sat inside but I requested an outdoor table and they said they would let us know if one came up, which they did within 10 mins of us sitting down! We had a nice big table outside, not with much of a view but the atmosphere was still nice with fairy lights around us. (We had had cocktails at the bar before dinner to see the view anyway).The food was up there with the best I've had, we had black cod, John Dory, lobster claw tempura, fried prawns, udon noodles, broccolini and rice. Thats 4 mains and 3 sides, and it was a perfect amount for us - but we do have big appetites!The cocktails were also very well made, the Delicious Sour was a winner. The service was quick and friendly. Our waiter was cracking jokes about English people (me) but it was all in good fun!The music was good too, mainly cool chilled house, not too loud but loud enough to create a bit of atmosphere and the bar got busier later on too, which was fun.Definitely recommended for a date or with friends
5
The views alone are worth a visit to this lovely top floor restaurant, especially after sun down, when the light and laser show start and the whole of Singapore is illuminated. I have to say, Im not a huge fan of Japanese food, simply because Ive not eaten it that often. The food was serve at a steady pace, the food was really fresh and served with style. Couldnt recommend this place highly enough. We had a ball

We were looking for somewhere special for my wife's birthday treat and a friend recommenced this restaurant. So I contacted via email and had an immediate response and booked online. On arrival at Tower 3, we 'checked-in' on the ground floor and then whisked up to level 57 to the restaurant. On arrival we were met by pleasant staff and as were early were invited to use the lounge for drinks, but we preferred to stay outside and enjoy cocktails and the stunning view. We chose to dine, 'El-Fresco' on the outer deck where we were able to enjoy a fabulous view across the harbour and Gardens By the Bay. We were very well looked after by 'Rita', who even provided a candle for our 'Birthday Cake'! The lighting dim lighting provided a level of intimacy and a book-light was provided to easily read the menu - nice touch! The food was excellent, the view amazing and the overall atmosphere elegant but lively... I can certainly recommend this venue for anyone looking for a 'special' evening. tip, arrive before dark and enjoy the 'Day View' then watch as darkness falls and the spectacle of lights appears

We decided to spend our last night in Singapore having drinks at the Ce La Vi Club Lounge - not expecting too much. We arrived and made our way to the top - bought 1st round of drinks and began to take in the view. Decided to add our name to the waiting list for a table to eat dinner - the best dinner we have had in a restaurant that we can recall. The restaurant manager Maurice - showed us to the perfect table - just inside the open air restaurant - so friendly and gracious. Then we were lucky enough to have Rita take care of us. Excellent service, great recommendations on food - we had Tuna tartare and vegetable tempura for starters - delicious - followed that up with the Blue Fin tuna main and the fried squid! Amazing! Food was beyond our expectations and the service could not have been better - Rita was courteous, friendly, kind and knowledgeable of the menu selections. We had several cocktails and found ourselves too full for dessert - unfortunately. We had a wonderful time in the restaurant and bar - met some wonderful people and we were so happy that we decided to go to Ce La Vi! Highly recommend it when you visit Singapore - we will be back!

A very special dinner!! The view, drinks and food are amazing. Special thanks to the very kind and professional Rita, who helped making this night extraordinary!
5
A superb experience for brunch, euopean asian fusion food with a fantastic view. There is also an unlimited champagne option to go with it.
5
Amazing view, friendly staff and reasonable prices for drinks.
If you are thinking of going to sky Park I suggest going to ce la vi instead for a coffee and free entrance to the floor higher were you can still take pictures.

Lovely views and setting. Wine and cocktails spectacular. Served by Yul - perfect. Food was a little over priced but nice
4
It is just beautiful to sit and sip a well made beverage looking out to the city below you. Food is at par with some of the best restaurants out there. A wholesome experience.
5
Dinner was amazing with perfect service from the best waiter Vincent! View is spectacular!!! We had squid for entree was very nice then followed by chicken terriyaki and prawns for main, everything was cooked perfectly and was a very good quantity too quality ratio. For dessert we had the fondant and frontage nothing else to say but WOW!!! We then finished the beautiful night on the rooftop bar with of course a few Singapore slings! Would recommend 100% and we are definitely visiting CE LA VI the next time we come too visit the wonderful Singapore

Was there with a bunch of office colleagues as a part of an official dinner. We took a set menu. The food was very tasty and we all enjoyed every bit. The salmon they served was awesome. So was their dessert, named as Garam masala Chocoloate cake. Add to this, was the service by the restaurant staff. They were simply awesome! The best restaurant service I ever had in any part of the globe
2
Basically, we went to have dinner with a view. We booked a month ahead, we asked for an outdoor table with a view of the marina bay area. When we arrived, we were sat inside, the view was obstructed, in fact the only place where the restaurant view isn't obstructed by the skypark crowds is at the bar and you can't even sit there. The cost was over S$200/pax with minimal drinks for a party of 7, the food was ok, nothing spectacular, and we were told we could only have the table for 2 hours. When we wanted to venture to a better view corner, we couldn't even get close to the bar it was so overcrowded. MBS mgmt and staff seem more concerned with packing in guests as opposed to providing teh premium dining venue, and view experience they promote

We have been to this bar and restaurant before, when it was run as KuDeTa. That was an exceptional experience, unfortunately this time it was not.Booking was made and all Ok when we arrived. Decided to have pre dinner cocktails in the adjacent bar. To put it simply, the bar is run by children and needs a complete personality mind shift. Customers are treated curtly ( we witnessed this for about 45 mins) with zero focus on good customer service standards and making the experience a great one for the paying clients. Some staff are outright arrogant and should not be in any publics facing roles. Bar prices are expectedly high, and reasonably but not exceptionally well made. We were assigned to a great table and ordered our meal. We did notice we had up to 3 staff looking after our needs, and this is where the evening started to come really unstuck. Courses would come out one at a time. Not one course per time, but one person per course per time. So this left us watching each other eat our meals all night, to the point we had to stop the process and ask staff to serve us up together. This was still not possible, hence our frustration in what appeared to be a lazy kitchen who couldn't seem to coordinate two orders to be served at the same time. To add to this, when the food did arrive, it was unremarkable.As we went to pay/leave, the manager came over to take our payment and ask if we enjoyed ourselves. We were honest and shared our experiences with Maurice. All credit to her, she showed genuine interest in our opinions of the night. She said it appeared we were not advised at the time of ordering that their kitchen serves one person per time, which explained the process mentioned above. To be honest, that's absolutely ridiculous to think guests would be happy with one meal per table being served at any time.We had declined her kind offer for a complimentary wine as we were full and ready to leave, and so she made some changes to our bill which was very much appreciated, if unexpected. She also sent two flutes of champagne which we enjoyed back at the bar. Whilst discussing our previous great experiences at this venue, Maurice did explain the name change was part of a buyout, with the new owner being the LVMH Group. She agreed it appeared they had some way to go to meet the exceptionally high standards this owner is renown for, but we do think if Maurice's response is anything to go by, they'll get there

Ce La Vi is a must while visiting Singapore. The food was excellent (a little expensive $80. min. per person but with that kind of atmosphere its to be expected) The Thursday night D.J was on point with his r&b house mixes. So nice we went twice
4
We went up here for drinks on our first night in the city. It's a test way to see the layout of the city over a drink and the view is spectacular. Much better value than paying to go to the Skydeck.
5
we had dinner to celebrate my birthday and it was very good. food is excellent; choice of wines is good but expensive. the view is marvelous. reservations are required.
5
Loved our night at the restaurant. Staff were very professional. Impressed with the way we were looked after and the food we chose was top notch. Have some wonderful photos with great views to remember this special night. Would suggest you reserve a table.
5
My fiancé and I were there for 2 hrs dinner during sunset time. The waitress Rita was super friendly, helpful and nice to us, food was very delicious and the atmosphere was so peaceful and enjoyable that it is hard to explain. It turned out that my "boyfriend" was about to propose that time so the waitresses have decided to help him out and brought us a desert with the proposing words. A very unexpected surprise ☺️ We loved that place for the views, service, food and feelings we had come through. An extremely lovely place to be!!
5
This was for sure one of our best dinner experiences. Although it's not cheap, it's definitely worth the money. We visited on Juky the 7th and had the Ce La Vi tasting menue wich was fantastic but the pairing wines recommended by the Sommelier Andi made it "mind blowing"!My wife and I had a wonderful experience, starting from the warm welcome from Raquel the Guest Relations Manager who found a wonderful table for us and explained everything in detail, contiuned by Zac our perfect waiter to Andi who explained the wines in great detail!If you have the chance to visit the Ce La Vi do so, not only for the looks but for the whole experience!Thanks again to the whole team - please keep up your excellent work
5
Was with my partner and it was our last night in Singapore and we decided on this restaurant and we were not disappointed! Fantastic food, great ambiance and attention to detail service. Also a view to die for! Portion sizes were bigger than expected which was a present surprise as most of the dishes were $30-$50 each!
5
I'm living in Singapore, and my parents in Korea came to see me during their holidays. We were seated inside, but can fully see the view of Singapore downtown. When we ordered some food, one kind Korean waitress came to us, and explained to my parents in Korean about the meal including what is the signature menu in Ce La Vi. My parents felt really comfortable thanks to her kindness. I think her name was Scarlett. I could enjoy my time with my parents because she served were really nice to us.(also she brought us to the deck to take a photo of Singapore's scenic view) My parents went back to Korea with good memory
5
Service was attentive and pleasant, suggestions were appreciated and spot on. Crispy squid, tempura prawns, sushi, ribeye and decadent chocolate dessert were all delicious. The manager visited our table several times, he was charming as well as a good listener. Fireworks were the attraction last night at the restaurant/club and while it was very busy, the restaurant itself was pleasant and not too loud. There were children as well as couples and all seemed to be enjoying themselves. Hats off to Hira Mokomoko and staff
5
My cousins and I decided to have our reunion at Ce La Vi. The food is excellent, just cook to perfection with beautiful layout. The view is amazing and on top of that, our bartender did an excellent job. Sly was professional yet fun. He surprised us with different cocktails each time we asked. My favorite is the yet-to-named passionfruit mango cocktail that he just invented some time last week. We had a wonderful time and would totally come back. :
5
I visited Singapore and we went to have a dinner at Ku De Ta now known as Ce La Vi. The place was gorgeous and very romantic, The food was great and the staff are very accomodating and nice. I would like to mention Fabio and Loewy for being very accomodating and all other staff, great job. I would recommend to visit and have an experience of a lifetime. I definitely will come back
5
Spectacular night time views, cocktails at the outdoor bar, friendly staff, tasty dishes shared with a friend, nice wine, romantic atmosphere. All ingredients are there for the perfect evening in a superb location!
5
We celebrated out 1st wedding anniversary there. The food and service were simply amazing. Higlly recommend their seafood especial black cod fish. We definitely be coming again!
4
Many times in Ce La Vi (previously KUDETA). Frat service, spelndid view and friendly service. I recommend sinset time (7pm)

Visited for Sunday brunch during a short weekend stopover in Singapore. Views are breathtaking and we had a lovely table situated right by the edge. Only thing was that people kept trying to squash round the table to take pictures of the view which, although not the restaurant's fault, was very irritating when you are eating and to be honest down right rude.Thought that the menu was more lunch than brunch but as we were eating at midday that didn't really matter that much to us. The food was very nice but I would not say outstanding,for example I've had much better and tastier sushi elsewhere.We found the service very good and noticed that (I guess) the maitre d' was extremely observant and made sure tables and plates were cleared promptly.I would say that value for money it is fine especially if you take into account where you are and the views. We did not want any alcohol so that kept the price down but we noticed that it doubled if you did.All in all go for the views and a nice brunch & tick it off your "been there, done that list
5
We had a delicious 3-course meal at Ce La Vi. Every dish was beautifully presented and delicious. The view was stunning especially because on that particular Saturday night they had rehearsals for Singapore's Jubilee celebrations, so there were fireworks that made the night extra special.What made our night truly special however was the waitress that attended to us. Unfortunately we didn't get her name but she was fantastic and went above and beyond later by recommending popular tourist destinations for us especially because it was our first night and proper time in Singapore. She spoke with us for several moments telling us about places she had personally been to and places that she had loved. The service was personalised and fantastic
5
We book a table at ce la vi last night tuesday but the front staff give us a big table which is you can seat until 6 person. I wasnt happy as i informed the staff (gentlemen) who let us seat the table insist that we couldnt have any other table outside only inside if we want. Weve order our food and the lady staff recommend some dishes which we really like as we are vegetarian. And ask her again wether we can move to the sofa side she did not promise if we can but she tried and get back after 10mins and she transfer us to the table we ask since we arrive the restaurant. Small detail like this can make us happy cause my husband birthday. And she really ask and check wether we are ok with the food and table. Before we leave the table i asked her name cause she dont have any name KUDOS TO JACQUELINE. We will definitely come back and bring friend for her service.
5
A big thanks to Maurice...We were pleasantly surprise with the very cute anniversary cake and your ability to provide us with good arrangement from the indoor seat with the sunset view to the outdoor seat with the real good view from the top...Thank you so much to you and to your team for making our second wedding anniversary even more special and it was indeed one great night to remember in singapor
2
Other than the view, this place is way overrated with mediocre service, food and drinks at exorbitant prices considering that there is now cover charge. Sitting and lighting are not ideal for proper meals and crowd is just as pretentious as the place.For the view, simply stay in the hotel or pay for a pass to the deck, skip this as there are a lot more better restaurants and clubs in town
2
The view from the restaurant is fantastic. Went for their champagne brunch on a Saturday afternoon. Food was very disappointing. May have been aesthetically pleasing but not to the palate. Made up only by the endless flow of champagne, wines and beer.... And the amazing view.
5
In a city brimming with rooftop bars, Ce La Vi definitely deserves a mention. Beautiful views, great set up and an extensive list of amazing cocktails is perfectly matched with their great service. Our bartender Sly was not just an absolute magician with his drinks, he was also incredibly friendly and made us a lot of customised cocktails. Two other people who made our first trip to Ce La Vi absolutely splendid were Nithy and Leo who welcomed us ever so warmly at the club. It was a special occasion for us and the collaborative efforts of the entire team will definitely make us come back for more
3
Great view of Singapore, without a doubt. Food was very expensive, serving was in small portions, taste was so-so. Well this is the kind of price to pay for dining at MBS!
5
The food prepared by chef Wei Liang was delicious. And the view is one of a kind. our server Ken was very attentive and explains all the food very well. Its a must to visit if you are in singapore!
4
An unbelievable view of the city and the Gardens. Head there for sunset and before the cover charge kicks in at 8pm.
5
Fantastic view of course, go in the evening for a drink before 9pm after that a cover charge apply, & make sure you dress smart casual at least for drink or elegantly if you're planning to have dinner.
5
This restaurant is amazing, located at the Sky Park of Marina Bay Sands hotel, we were staying at the hotel and this was a fantastic way to finish our two night stay by dining here in the evening. The food was exceptional, their were three of us dining, we had black cod, seared tuna and chicken teriyaki all were excellent and washed down with a lovely bottle of Amarone, what more could you ask for, thanks to Rita for excellent service with a lovely smile and thank you for a lovely birthday cake that you bought out a complete surprise
5
great place to go for a drink. Same price as going to the Sky park with no drink. 57th floor. good selection of cocktails. S$24 dollars plus tax. we had a Columbus and Rose Lemonade, then stayed for dinner. Excellent sticky squid and prawn salad followed by duck and chicken terrayaki with excellent friend rice and great desserts. Lovely bottle of Primitivo but wines are not cheap but great selection. superb views out to sea and back into the Ba
5
Great restaurant and food!This is without a doubt the best restaurant in Singapore!! Their Asien fusion kitchen is perfect! You have to try their chocolate foundant!!!! And the view.... Wauw!!! Go there around 5:30ish - so you see the view when it is still light as well.
5
My partner and I had the three course taster menu for lunch and it was amazing value for money. I had the squid to start which was brilliant, the rib eye steak for main which was super succulent and enjoyable, with a chocolate fondant to finish, which was exceptional. Really enjoyed this. Was only $48SGD for the taster menu. And we were very satisfied. Delighted with the standard and quality of the steak. Would recommend the taster menu. Staff were great, but drink prices slightly high, but for Singapore you can't expect much else!
3
As expected, the food here was beyond words and worth every Singapore dollar. The bar adjacent to this restaurant also offers magnificent views of the skyline. The ambiance inside the restaurant was also good but one downside is that some of the staff were rude. We had to wait for our table to get ready even though we requested for a side table when making our reservation. But still, we had a good time and savored the sights around the city
5
We were due to visit SIngapore to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary and decided to book a meal at CE LA VI, the restaurant at the top of the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel. We loved the idea of dining in the clouds and having that amazing view to look at as we ate!I booked online around a month in advance and received an email to say they had my enquiry and would confirm within one week whether or not my reservation was firm, which they duly did. However, that email said that to reconfirm the booking, I would need to contact them 24 hours prior to our arrival. As it happens, I totally forgot to do this as I was too busy enjoying my holiday with my husband! It was fine though - they obviously had a note of our reservation at the downstairs check-in desk and we were allowed to make our way up in the elevator to the 57th floor.We had left ourselves enough time to have a drink at The Skybar before dinner and to admire the fantastic 360 degree views that you get- absolutely stunning! It was busy but not to the point where everyone was squashed together and you could always find a spot to stand by the railings for the must-have photos of you and the view! Drinks were pricey but that's to be expected.We were greeted warmly at the reservation desk and our waitress for the evening showed us to a lovely outside table with a stunning view. She promptly brought us drinks while we made our choices and was very friendly and attentive for the rest of the evening, without being intrusive.We shared spicy sashimi salad and spicy tuna roll to start then roasted black cod and grilled rack of lamb, accompanied by wok-fried brocollini, spicy fried mushrooms and shiso flower fried rice. Everything was delicious and served like it was a work of art, so beautifully arranged on the plates. The lamb was flavoursome and tender but we both agreed that the cod was really outstanding, just bursting with flavour and cooked perfectly. I'd say the amount of food we'd chosen was about right, we felt satisfied but not too stuffed. We chose our puds and I nipped to the loo before they arrived. It turned out that my husband and the waitress were chatting while I was away and he'd mentioned we were there for our Silver Wedding Anniversary. The puds arrived, mango-passion and fromage blanc and strawberry-shiso meringue plus another one, chocolate fondant, and the waitress announced that they were with the compliments of CE LA VI for our anniversary. How sweet of them! We also saw a girl at a nearby table receive a complimentary pud with a candle as she was celebrating her birthday. It's that kind of attention to detail that leaves you with a warm glow and makes you feel welcomed and cared-for as a guest.  We both finished with coffees and including wine, the meal came to around $S340 (approx £170). We felt this was excellent value for the quality and quantity of food - it's billed as modern Asian cuisine- as well as the amazing service you receive, the stunning surroundings in which you eat and the wonderful ambiance that CE LA VI undoubtedly has . There is a minimum spend at dinner of $S80++(approx £40 plus taxes) so you could easily go for the experience without going too mad. Dress code is smart casual after 5pm ish, which essentially means no sandals, no vests or shorts for men. We saw a family who obviously thought they could get away with this as their boy had shorts on when they arrived. His face was a picture when the reservations team brought out a hideous pair of oversized, mustard-coloured slacks for him to change into!Al in all, CE LA VI gave us a very special night which we'll remember for a long time to come
5
Staff here were excellent and very accomodating. The food was also very high standard. However, the view over Singapore was awesome. Would definitely go back.
5
Mindblowing view while enjoying your dinner here.. the seating place is reserved for the diners and one has to spend a minimum of 80SGD per person. Food was nice, but I think i did it just one rtime for enjoying the view from here
4
We tried the tasting menu and it was very complete. The sushi tempura rolls were just amazing. We arrived at sunset and left at night to enjoy the Marina Bay Sands view.
5
Having Rita to look after our every need, our last night in Singapore was a magical journey of food and cocktails with the backdrop of one of the worlds best views. Thanks for making our evening very special.
5
dear. Customer service manager scalett!
It was so satisfied with reasonable price food and friendly service. I want to visit again and visit. The best place to see the city of singapore!
4
A breath-taking view of Singapore with some really good food. An impromptu decision had us ending up at Ce La Vie but fortunately we were not disappointed. Got a table without reservation and the service was impeccable. Rita was the perfect host - guiding us through the menu and ensuring our comfort throughout the meal.  An experience defilnitely not to be missed
3
It's good to go there if you want to enjoy view from MBS, especially at night and for sunset. Didn't like though, that food became more of asian dining. For me it was always western place, where a lot of business men visiting city for couple of days could come for drinks after signing the deal
5
I took my wife, mother-in-law and brother-in-law to the sunday brunch at the restaurant. The views are perhaps the best any restaurant in Singapore could offer. The brunch was a bit different from most brunches we have been to in that the buffet is actually served at your table. You get to choose a selection of entree's and then you choose your A La Carte main meal. The sweets are then selected from a buffet presentation. The food was top class asian fusion and delicious and the selection of sweets was to die for. The buffet was topped off with free flow Ruinhart champagne. I would definitely recommend this brunch
5
Make sure to call ahead and try to reserve an outdoor table near the rail for an unobstructed view of the city at sunset...it is AMAZING!!! I enjoyed a tuna roll, salmon and a wonderful chocolate desert. Service was top-notch. All at a price, but you only live once, so indulge yourself
2
No doubt the location may be the best in the world with stunning views of singapore sky scrapers iconic world class location.Service is the worst i ever seems compare to last time i visited here.Visited around 2pm in the afternoon, as singapore weather the management should think of how to accommodate the guest how to enjoy themselves under the hot suns. No doubt some prefer under the hot suns but given more option for those doesn't like too much on direct sunshine.No host or hostess on the reception area, which we walk in ourselves. We wanted to seat at the cabana area with some sofas under the umbrella, however we were reject by the servers, and was informed that minimum of SGD 300 applies for the seats. Fair enough, but we were not being offer by other option. SImple the cocktail stand along the glass panel was simply too hot. Ask him to shift one of the pillars in to the shelter was reject by first. By he still manage to shift for us. While another lady came by 2 minutes later and inform us they are not allowed to shift the pillars, and inform us minimum for SGD 200 applies for those wanted to enjoy at the cabana sofa area, which was to different pricing for that area. Fair enough we found one of the pillars just nice covering under the shade empty we moved there. Got a bottle of champagne and have a little chat.SIngapore weather simply too hot to stand even with the shades and fan. After awhile we leave.Based on my observation the cabana seats simply occupied by caucasian, if Asain enters minimum spending applies, but not for caucasian
5
Hands down this is one of the best meals I have had in a while. Everything was tasty, beautifully presented and quickly served. Quite pricey but worth it. Will definitely be coming back again on my next visit.
5
We had a fantastic experience dining at ce la vi. Thanks to two of the staff who catered our needs, Leo and the bubbly lady Carly. They're all accomodating. Food was delicious. Will definitely recommend it. 👍🏻👍🏻
5
Excellent dinner and good place for drinking smtg on the top of sands. More informal than sky57, same great view. Not cheap but is worth it.
5
We had a great time at the luxury restaurant and all the prices of the food were extremely reasonable. The service at the restaurant was very welcoming and a serviceperson called scarlett was more friendly towards us.
5
Ce la vie is definitely worth the visit. The food was fantastic, with the help of our waitress Rita who gave us excellent recommendations & fantastic friendly service throughout the night. There was plenty of selection on the menu & the drinks menu! Great atmosphere with a fantastic view and a must if you visit Singapore
5
Wow what fabulous food. It was a mission to get a booking but well worth the effort. The service was personalised and friendly without being over the top. Stunning location, outside on the deck at the top of Singapore amazing. The pre dinner drinks bar was very cramped, very expensive and we were disappointed no free access to the viewing deck for the paying diners. However the good points of this dining experience far outweighed the negatives, and we all enjoyed out evening out
4
This was our first time at this luxury outdoor restaurant. We had wonderful personal service from our waiter Rita, who helped with food and wine choices. All the food was beautifully presented and of the highest quality, and of course the view was spectacular. Beautiful and romantic
5
Went up here a couple of year ago for a meal when it was called Ku De Ta, great then and still is. I was only here fro pre drinks this time before heading on elsewhere but we had a great time enjoying the view with some nibbles and drinks at the bar, all very nice, pricey mind
5
We booked well in advance for our outdoor table at CE LA VI, which had stunning views of the Bay. Our waitress was efficient, and provided an excellent table service. We dined at 7.30pm.We had a luxury dinner comprising Scallops, Foie Gras, Prawns, Duck and more. All cooked to perfection, and absolutely delicious. The cocktail menu is also extensive and has great variety.We were never made to feel rushed, and we sat after dinner having some more drinks and enjoying the stunning views. A fantastic treat for you and a loved one, and very romantic
1
Overpriced, rude staff, poor service and generally very disappointing. Upon arriving we proceeded to sit on a free couch but were told that was only for "people spending a minimum of $350" how rude. Firstly how dare they assume you are going to spend a cent or $1000 there, they have no idea. Once we complained and also mentioned that we had 5 others joining us we were allowed to stay on a side couch we had commandeered. Upon ordering a G&T and a Bellini that were both ridiculously overpriced they were even low tide in that glass! One of our friends tried to order a Cointreau Lime & Soda (not an uncommon drink) the waitress had no idea and said it was not possible. Upon him going to the bar the barman was fine to make it. The sunset and view was amazing and worth doing once but they certainly take advantage of you. Left there feeling violated! Never to return. Not surprised by the name change, probably had too many complaints with the previous name so changed it instead of improving it I guess
5
Would recommend to anyone that enjoys great food, fantastic views & friendly service. Our waitress Rita was really nice & helpful. I will definitely be back soon!
5
Rita was wonderful and the food was delicious. We had lunch here on a rainy day in Singapore and it was delightful on top of the Marina Sands Resort
5
Good food with an amazing view. Service was fast and well organized. Recommend it to people who want to enjoy a good lunch or snack.
4
Romantic setting atop Marina Bay Sands. Decent quality food in small portions. Bar service for drinks ordered at the table was slow.
5
Our server Jess was extremely warm and friendly, and stayed by our table the whole time! It was my Birthday and she truly helped make it wonderful. She arranged a special cake for the occasion on short notice (my wife told her discretely that it was my Birthday). I was really impressed by the personal attention. The food on the whole was excellent. The view and ambiance were spectacular and as I like to say to my family "second to none in the world"
4
Two of us dined at 9pm at Ce La Vi and had a wonderful time. Seating was prompt and we took a table just off the bar. The restaurant is open air, and is separated from the bar with a glass railing. The table area is raised about 2 feet above the bar so we could see the skyline. We understood going in that we were paying a premium for the view, as the food is expensive. With that being said, we had a great meal. High quality food prepared perfectly and a decent bottle of wine. This is a meal we will remember for a long time because it is a special location. If you want to experience the view and not have dinner, just go up and have a drink at th bar. No one will pressure you to order drinks as we did wait in the bar for about 25 minutes because we were early. Very professional staff and great service.Note about other reviews: the staff told us that food ordered was meant to be shared,and might not arrive together, but will arrive when ready. Our two mains did arrive together, but we shared everything and it was very well timed
5
With only one night in town I headed straight for the restaurant Ce La Vi on the 57th floor Skypark. Good food, wonderful view but best of all was the service. A lovely young woman named Raquel looked after me, showing me around the restaurant and bar. When travelling on your own and going to a restaurant you are often shown a table at the back or near the kitchen. Raquel seated me in a great spot so I could see the amazing lights of Singapore. Thank you for a great night. B

Lets get straight to it. The best thing is the view but is it really necessary to dine here? For me the answer is no. Having been here several times, we always had a good time but I never enjoyed the food. The menu is totally overrated. You will be shocked by your bill.But have I mentioned the view? Which you can also get when you only go for a drink at the bar. So you should come here, have a drink and go again.And don´t´forget the view
4
The experience was a thrill just because of the location, although finding your way to the place, starting in the lobby, was like getting through security at a big airport. The view was spectacular, and the food was very good, although I wouldn't say it was worth the price paid (almost nothing in Singapore is worth what you have to pay for it). Good wine list and very courteous steward. Wait staff very courteous, but the servers were a little clueless, bringing the wrong dishes to the wrong people at the table, and to the wrong table. Despite it being open-air, the place was loud. Later we realized it was live music, but with obviously poor sound system as it felt recorded (and the talent level did not rise to the floor-height of the venue - a familiar experience in Singapore, where entertainment is often bland and surprisingly unsophisticated, considering the affluent clientele)
4
When you go to Singapore, most people want to go on the flyer to see the amazing views over the area. However, if you go to the Ce La Vi bar on the 57th floor, you'll see the same views and be in beautiful surroundings. Absolutely beautiful

The food and views are very good. The desserts are an absolute must have. You won't regret it leaving a bit of space for them. Otherwise nothing to add, just a great place anyone can recommend to friends.

Fantastic food, great friendly and catered to service. This restaurant is a great way to show off the skyline of Singapore and has one of the best views around.
5
Had a fine lunch course which had a good balance of Asian and European taste. Amazing view from sky tower of marina bay sands added nicer experience. Especially, Korean-speaking staff served us in a good manner.

Dear Customer Service Manager,
We appreciate much about the service that Jane offered me and my friend Sam Lim.
Jane performs well throughout the dinner course with excellent customer caring approach.

This is one great Fine Dining restaurant at the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands. Service is excellent, staffs are great and quality and taste of food is just excellent. Bit Expensive though, mandatory minimum per person food should be S$80. However it goes well beyond that
5
Me and my friends went to Celavi to have snacks, as expected the view was spectacular! It was crowded that time but One of the staffs Ryan find way to get us a table. Food was delicious. Waiters and waitresses were very friendly specially Yul and Carly. They're very passionate with their work and of course with their charming smiles! Thanks Celavi! Great experienced
5
Brilliant views of Singapore, well worth the visit.Food was fantastic and there is a bar on the same floor with music and balcony Bar with a DJ.Free access to the restaurant and Bar but you need to buy tickets for the skywalk if you want to do this

It was just an unique experience to be sitting on that height, well organized restaurant. Some staff looked sick of serving guests, but the other staff were very professional, sensible, they knew how to take care of guests in that kind of place. (57F, limited space under that strong) One of very impressive staffs whose name is Jane, she was the excellent staff in that restaurant. She looks to be from other country(speaking fluent Korean), was always perfect to take care of her table in moment wise, appetite wise, and emotion wise. Worthy enough to represent whole staff and cooks
5
I read through the most recent reviews of this restaurant and really don't understand the travellers experiences.. We are quite fussy and like to spend our money wisely, so I don't think I was blown away simply because I was on a 57th floor. The drinks and food were excellent! We tried quite few dishes, from sashimi to steak and we were 'hmmmmm-ing' long after. The restaurant was full so the food came slowly, but after we said we need to catch a flight in few hours they sped it up for us. Our waiter Ken was super friendly and sweet, so we can only highly recommend Ce La Vi

a excellent location for a restaurant on the top floor of the Marine Bay Sands Hotel. this restaurant should be ashamed of what they are doing. The food and service are an absolute disgrace. The food is poor, very poor. and the prices are just ridiculous. i really don't mind paying top dollar to eat in restaurants with amazing settings like this, BUT i don't like being taken for a fool, the food is very amateur, the service is slack. if you want to go for a meal and be totally ripped off and experience poor food and service but excellent views, this is the place to go. i do feel very cheated, as the prices they are charging for food and drinks you would expectthis to be exceptional and it is far from it. I WOULD like a management response from this, and a explanation how they can charge these ridiculous amounts for such poor quality of food and service........but i doubt they will.. i like another reviewer would edge on the side of caution regarding the excellent reviews for Ce La Vi, when the reviewer only has made one or two reviews this raises suspinsions with me.... YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES ESPECIALLY WHEN SINGAPORE IS SUCH A AMAZING CITY
4
We were taken care by two most amazing Ce La Vi team (Ken and Djessa) and experience best food pairing ever in such an altitude.
5
Visited the bar and it was such an experience! The view was amazing and if you are looking for drinks they've got awesome mixologist(Look for Sly, he's awesome).
Def recommend if to anyone who is around the area!
4
We went for the view on top of the marina sands It was $24 for a cocktail so a treat but excellent mixology they where busy so service a bit slow but friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere we felt it was well worth it!
5
My Taiwanese friend came to Singapore for touring and visiting me. I just bring her to the best bar in Singapore. She really like the view and atmosphere there, and we also meet a cute bartender, Sly. He was so gentle that he help me keep away the stranger from my girl. He is a nice bartender I have never meet!!! If you come from Taiwan, just find Sly and tell him what you like to drink. Sly, we love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

On top of Marian Sands Skypark there is this lovely restaurant CE LA VI. The ideal time would be to have a nice romantic dinner up there. It isn't cheap. However it is very popular. Seems to be a place you go to, even if it is just for a coffee
2
Ce La Vi is a beautiful looking restaurant with a lovely atmosphere with great views. If you want to come for the views i would recommend the Sky Bar which is outside the restaurant. The food is not good. It was not up to the 5 star standard that we were expecting. It was no more than a 3. My meal was worse than i would get in a food court and my husbands chicken dish was not good either. The meals were so expensive and we felt ripped off that the food was so crap. We would have paid no more than $10 for each for the quality of the food. It is a shame because it could be something really special. It has a great atmosphere and the staff are lovely. It is a pity about the food and pricing. I wouldn't recommend
5
Three friends and I dined here during May whilst it was still called Ku De Ta.The location is awesome and I can't think of any better located restaurant. The views at night are stunning and make for an almost surreal location for dinner.The staff were fantastic and only to happy to help with queries and recommendations.The food was also great and the restaurant doesn't simply rely on its outstanding location to generate business. The food was some of the best I ate whilst in Singapore.Definitely worth a visit
2
This is an expensive restaurant which, I imagine, prides itself on service as well as food. To be fair, the food was delicious but that joy was short-lived in our memories compared to the appalling treatment we received. On a Friday night the restaurant turns into a nightclub and the staff therefore have to clear the floor of all tables and chairs. We were dining quite late and were clearly therefore in the way. Plates were removed before all of us had finished eating and throughout the meal there was the constant banging and scraping as furniture around us was removed. In fact by the end of the 'rushed' meal, we were only one of two tables still on the floor!I understand that this is a business but if the restaurant doesn't want diners there at a certain time then they should not have seated us
5
I had heard so much about the view at the top of the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore, I decided to see it for myself and top it off with a light lunch and drink. Deciding on Ku De Ta included a free elevator ride to the top and direct entry on arrival. As the elevator doors opened, the view across the bay was spectacular. I was greeted by a restaurant maitre-de and asked if I wanted to sit inside or on the balcony and although the Singapore midday sun was as always very apparent, beautiful large red umbrellas adorned the deck and I was escorted to a lovely lounge/table area right next to the viewing deck. I was offered a drinks menu and lunch menu and decided on a virgin Singapore Sling cocktail and a simple but delicious grilled prawn salad. Service was impeccable, the waiters were very friendly and accommodating with photo shots, and all in all it was an experience I will never forget. As they say, "Life's not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away" and that was KU DE TA, Singapore. You have to experience it!
5
We were taken by some great friends to dine and party on our last nights stay in Singapore to Ce la vie. The staff, food, views and ambience were second to none. Such a lasting impression for us. I would put this on a must visit list for anyone who gets the chance. Excellent
5
The best place in Singapore to be visited for sure. Go in the evening to get the view of the city with lightings.
5
We had a wonderful lunch at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel with yummy, gourmet food and fantastic service by Rita, our wonderful wait person! Rita really seemed to enjoy every minute of interaction with her clients and was so friendly and helpful! What a fun experience
4
On top of the hotel right in the center of the bay. Full scale views of Singapore. Fusion food. Small plates to share. Night club once the sun sets. Roof top bar available for drinks before dinner. Booking dinner here is a great way to get up to this roof top and enjoy the atmosphere. No regrets.
5
The view was outstanding and the dining atmosphere was lively but what really caught me by surprise was the quality of the food. We shared starters and mains to try as many dishes as possible. What I really liked was how the dishes were well executed. The crispy salmon skin salad had great texture play and the dressing for the mizuna salad complimented the slight peppery taste of the mizuna. Both the cod and halibut were nicely cooked and the marinates enhanced the delicate taste of the fish. The Coconut Pandan verrine was a definite surprise as it reminded me so much of kaya (coconut jam) yet it was light and creamy. Service was spot on without being intrusive. I wasn't expecting much initially, but left pleasantly surprised. Definitely piqued my interest to eat there again
5
Stunning location looking down over The Gardens By the Bay, great food and excellent service - the perfect ingredients for a special eveningThe menu was creative and the food was delicious, fitting well with the sharing concept of the restaurant. I particularly enjoyed the tiger prawn tempura with a hint of curry, the crispy sticky baby squid and the pan fried foie gras but every dish was good.The wine list was very extensive but there was an experienced sommelier on hand to advise. The Berry Bellini was a perfect refreshing cocktail to start the evening.Service provided by Rita was perfect being efficient and so friendly without losing formality. Leo of guest services was also very helpful in making it a dining experience to remember

Poor Service, Poor Food and a Poor Attitude sums up my feelings of Ce La Vi, which quite simply should be amazing.Ce La Vi is a Bar Restaurant and Club Lounge venue that sits on top of Tower 3 of the Marina bay Sands Complex.The first thing to understand is that CLV has nothing to do with the MBS except for location. It is a space that is let out to the company that operates CLV. in fact MBS seems to be structured like this is many areas.CLV is a good looking venue and offers amazing views across the city and gardens of Marina Bay, but the quality of its offering is what lets it down, and the management attitude does little to solve any issues.We dined as a party of four, on an outdoor table, the menu was interesting enough, but the standards quality was questioned from the moment we sat down. The water that was poured at the table was served without ice, now bearing in mind the evening temperature in Singapore is in the late 80s at this time of year, we really needed chilled water.We asked questions about the menu and were told the first 2 pages consisted of the Starters and the following 2 the main dishes, which made sense. We each ordered a dish from the starter pages and a dish from the main. Now I admit that I have various expectations from any restaurant that I go to, they start with Being Valued as a Customer and receiving Service and Food that represents value for money no matter what price range the venue sits. I also expect to eat at the same time of my dining companions, CLV failed on all points.The ladies with us received their first dishes, and we waited patiently for our starters to arrive, and then we waited some more. We told the girls to start as they had selected some Sushi style items which should not be left sitting outside a chilled enviroment for to long. I asked to see the Manager and told him I was not keen on watching others eat, and for them to have to watch us eat as our dishes had not arrived. He tried to tell me that the menu was served that way as it was a sharing menu. NOT TRUE, I pointed out to him that the waiter had not explained it that way, nor were we given sharing plates.Rule number one is this trade should be "Do not take your customers for Idiots" as we take exception to that kind of attitude. Anyway in fairness he chased up our Pork belly Lollipop starters and when they arrived they were nice, not special but okay. Of course the ladies had finished their food before ours arrived. The manager asured us that the main courses would all arrive together.They actually did, however we quickly realised that we woul be dissapointed. The Chicken Teriyaki dish was quite greasy and contained a lot of fatty bits. The steak item was nice and well cooked but only warm and served on a cold plate.the Sushi Roll were good, but the main issue was with The Scallops which were quite simply very undercooked. As soon as I cut into them I could tell, and called the waiter over, he informed the Manager who took them back to the kitchen and returned to offer an apology. Which basically evolved around blaming the staff and as a new venue they were not fully trained, your problem my friend not mine.Anyway the next set of Scallops arrived shortly, and yes they were also undercooked to the same extent. Now I am an experienced enough diner ( let's face it I have beeen eating food for nearly 60 years ) to know undercooked food when I get it. I simply turned my so called Seared Scallop over to tell by the colouring that it had only been cooked on one side. The manager then tried to tell me that this was the way it should be, I quite simply told him that if his chef believed this then he was in the wrong job. I even referred him to a brilliant You Tube video by Gordon Ramsey showing how to cook Scallops the correct way. So obviously by now my friends had finished their meals, so once again my dining experience was ruined. We made our feelngs quite clear to the Manager, who then assured me that he would not charge for the Scallops.....Really...Really ... why would you charge, I did not eat them. We indicated to him that we expected the bill to be reduced to reflect our poor dining experience, his response was to offer drinks to 2 of us. Clearly we told him this was not acceptable and that we wanted to see his senior. He told us that his decision was final and his attitude became agressive. Can you believe that they still insisted on applying the service charge to our bill.We found this intimidating and in order to ease the tension agreed to charge the bill to our hotel room, and that we would take it up with the Hotel Management in the morning. It was upon doing so that we found out that the restaurants within this hotel are simply rented space and the hotel has nothing to do with their operation standards.So Yes CLV you get a bad review because you deserve it, you had your chance to make this evening right, and you chose not to do so. Also call me cinical if you want, but I also question some of the authenticity of some of the positive reviews about this place, as many seem to have been written about this newly relaunched venue by first time reviewers.To the owners I say this, your own tag line, is "In Pursuit of Pleasure" to achieve this you need to try harder

went here with friends as part of my farewell brunch, the food menu was fairly disappointing, perhaps its the change in branding, the free-flow alcohol was in line with the rest of the brunch options in singapore, however we all left rather inebriated without having enough of food options to eat. the dessert spread wasn't too hot either, though the raspberry sorbet the kids ordered a la carte was pretty good. we did enjoy the free-flow champagne, but wish I'd gone to the fullerton or pan pacific instead where the brunch is total value for money!Service was pretty slow too.and inspite of spending $$$ for the brunch, the rules don't allow you to go to the viewing sky deck unless you're a hotel guest, or have bought a ticket, which seems a bit ridiculous after they charge you enormous amounts for brunch...style over substance..
5
I have been to CE LA VI last Sunday for a short visit with a friend of mine! The restaurant is amazing - the food is so delicious! Chef Michael Ng in person was serving the food to our table! The chief sommelier Michael Leitner over their managed to sell and impress us with 3 bottles of great wine - we only planned a quick visit but this guys and this view just keep you up there for hours! Thumbs up! Staff there is great - every single one

I have dinner with my Korean friend last Saturday. Both of us enjoy very much on the food recommended by their very friendly & helpful staff. I have to pen down my overeelming satisfaction with the food and especially the Korean staff by the name Jane. Jane have been very patient with us for suggestion of the good food and pay extra attention to detail on the services.nThanks to Jane & all at Celavi I will definitely recommend this Restaurent to all my friendI wish to give my special thanks to Jane for making the night so wanderful for u

MBS is without doubt one of the finest hotels in the world. BUT I know this disastorous place is rented out to this very amateur set up ( that's being polite) just simply shouldn't happen.Party of 4, here to spend and enjoy the evening. Starters all came out at different times, circa 15 mins for all to arrive. I do suspect certain starters are just chill stored and made out of house. But then the luke warm starters arrived and were ok and when I say ok they were without doubt no where near the price they are marketed at...Main courses... Just poor very poor. Cold plates, luke warm food, undercooked food.. COME ON CE LA VI, if you want to play with the big boys get it right. One of the main courses sent back but the chef/cook/microwave technician had gone home! Comical really.. I do hope MBS read this and sample this restaurant themselves as this is a disgrace to MBS and the wonderful city of Singapore. Top tip.... Don't waste your money. Restaurant manager, go back to basics handle complaints with a professional manner and don't ever again get aggressive. Also look at other reviews.... Not hard to work out where they come from
5
You have to listen to the great staff. Their recommendations pleased everyone. Great wine pairing skills from the sommelier Michael.
5
Breathtaking views, plates of food that melt in your mouth, cocktails you could drink forever and beautiful friendly staff. This place has the 'wow factor'. Each and every guest that I have taken to CE LA VI (even those afraid of heights) have been speechless. This truly is a life experience you need to try (more than once) before you die
5
Our friends have their leaving party in a fabulous place. We were sitted in a table with the view of garden by the bay was amazing. Staff are very attentive and friendly. Were were served with a beautiful bottle of wine with the best recommendation of chief sommelier michael leitner. It was a great place to chill out with friends
5
We went to Ce La Vi to celebrate the last night of our amazing Honeymoon. We were overwhelmed with the level of service we received from Hira and the team. The food was sensational! Even me, with a fear of heights thoroughly enjoyed the view, perhaps it was a cheeky glass of Champagne that also helped. My Husband and I "High-ly" recommend Ce La Vi for that amazing night out, the one you never forget..
4
It is a bit of a must if you like heights and want a good view of the city. The bar tenders need a little more practice at their cocktail making skills and there needs to be more food on the large plates for what they charge customers - other than this, it is both romantic and fun, depending on where you sit and the company you are with
5
From the minute you see this hotel structure with the three towers and a giant surfboard on top you cant stop looking at it. And then you want to go up there and the view from up there is as spectacular as you think it will be. Ce La Vi is a free way to get the view thogh the drinks cost enough to reflect the value of the view. But dont miss this. Just go up and get a Singapore Sling and soak in the views
5
I say 'must do' because this is a view not to miss out when your in town. Here you can feel the heart of Singapore whilst looking down onto Gardens by the bay on one side and the impressive modern cityscape on the other. I was lucky enough to be there on Wednesday night with friends who were too awestruck to look at the menu. We did finally order and although I'm not a huge fan of cod, the black cod Ce La Vi has on menu really Is impressive. The wine list is very varied from New Zealand to Portugese and everything in between. The service is the very best as I feel they get a few celebrities to accomodate, we were tabled next to a famous producer who was doing a set at the restaurants nightclub and of course we had to join the party. Singapore can be a little pricey but Ce La Vi is A worthwhile experience not to be missed
5
Had dinner with my Family, fantastic, the food and wines amazing.We had great Austrian wines recommenced bey Chief Sommelier Michael. The perfect match with the food. Thanks Michael you will see me again.I have to say wonderful friendly Staff with an breathtaking view.If you're in Singapore go there 
5
I'd been to this restaurant a few times. Which have been great, always good food and fun. Went along to this one with some friends, we were attending a outstanding guest relation, her name is Emma! She have a wonderful smiles which i love the most. She provides an amazing oustanding service which i never had been serve before. She's charming and lovely in all ways, even i myself observe her alot of times, she's looks tired but i can sees that she loves her job and attend to our needs. I have a message to her in here. To Emma, we are greatly appreciate for your amazing service. Really a good job to you, wishing you all the best in all things. We will be back again. Thank you so much Emma! God bless.

Restaurant formally known as Kudeta; Menu is useless; just ask chef to serve you anything he likes and you won't be disappointed.place is just too good. Nice view, pleasant weather and great service will leave you smiling. if budget is not an issue must try most premium steaks - test is something you won't forget :
5
Best to visit for 360 Degree Singapore view. Direct entry if you are not staying with Try Singapore Sling.
5
Huge view, very good service and excellent food. Especially, congratulations to Lily for its excellent service and Arlan as our guest relations, congratulations !!
4
The best views over Singapore, food was fantastic and atmosphere perfect. Loved every minute here, only criticism is it's a little pricey
5
Great place, lovely view, a lot of hard working people with passion up there.Manager Maurice is always doing her best to take care of the guest.Zac with the colorful hair, very friendly.Faraq good service !! Awesome cocktails, great great beautiful views !! Will always go back and bring friends there.Ce La Vi !!
5
This restaurant, formerly called KU DE TA, was the perfect place to bring my visiting guests this past weekend. We sat outside looking out over the city (on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands!) and the atmosphere was so cool. Our drinks were delicious (they even made my favorite drink from description which few places in Singapore have managed to do!). Dinner for us was a mix of seafood, sushi, salads and desserts and we ate every last bit of it. A wonderful evening that makes me smile when I think back on it. Thank you
5
I had a dinner at Cé La Vi and I have to admit, the view from this place is just breathtaking ! Not only the view is amazing but all the staff from the nice waitress to the wines advices from the sommelier Mickael Leitner made my diner unforgettable.A big thanks to them !
5
In addition of the spectacular place, amazing view, I had a very enjoyable lunch. The food is great and we had the chance to follow the recommandation of the sommelier, Michael Leitner, for the wines which was excellent and perfect match with our dishes.Thank you very much, I'll come back for sure!!

I heard that the city skyline of Singapore was beautiful, so I figured I'd enjoy the sunset by treating my husband and myself to a meal at KU DE TA (now CE LA VI) on our short getaway here. It was one of the best spending decisions I made while in Singapore - everything in Singapore can be pretty expensive compared to other Southeast Asian countries, so when I wanted to splurge I wanted it to be for nothing but the best view and the best food. We were served by a charming waiter Leonardo who was so attentive to our needs - he noted my husband's allergies and recommended other dishes. We had the wok fried shishito, soft shell roll, seared maguro tuna steak, braised iberico pork cheeks and the seared black angus beef tataki, which was my favourite. Hubby's favourite was the garam masala dessert. and it was just exquisite. I really like Asian food but I've never tried Asian food quite like this - licked my plate clean and we had the wonderful sunset accompanying us too! Couldn't resist a few cocktails so I got the Berry Bellini for myself and my husband got the Storm Cooler - perfectly refreshing as the weather in Singapore is so goddamn hot. We heard from the bartender there was also a club lounge - the one that was next to the infinity pool, so we headed over for MORE cocktails. Memory's abit fuzzy cos I definitely had a lot of cocktails that night, but I do remember having a great time! Loved the hits they were playin
4
Had a great time here with my wife. The place is beautifully set up. Food was great. Excellent wine, and the staff was very friendly. The view is magnificent. You can see most of Singapore from here. Best to make reservations in order to avoid disappointment
4
We had an excellent dinner following a stunning sunset viewed from the bar area over a cheeky mojito! Very efficient service, only let down by our table setting indoors (when we really would have liked an outdoor setting with the views). Not a cheap meal by any means, especially when you add in the expensive drinks prices prevalent all over Singapore, but well worth it for a special occasion. It's also worth noting that you won't have to pay for the views if you are eating or drinking, unlike those walking around the adjacent deck (so factor that into your costings as the place itself is a 'must-see' when in Singapore)
5
This is a beautiful restaurant with breathtaking & uninterrupted views of Singapore. I also havent found another bar/restaurant who can make a whisky sour like them! Yum! Food is a+
4
This place gives you a good idea of Singapore and nearyby islands. Drinks are expensive, very expensive, but that was common all over Singapore.It's not the tallest building though and there are also other amazing views from other hotels. We liked this particularly for the sea view
5
Couldn't fault our visit to Ku De Ta on Saturday 30th May 2015. We had pre-drinks at the bar and were told our table was waiting for us when we were ready. Our host, PJ, was polite, fun, informative and made the dining experience very enjoyable. Our starters were exceptional and our mains of steak with aubergine and pig's cheek were delicious. The red wine selection was excellent and reasonably priced for a restaurant of this calibre. Throughout the evening the service was superb and the location of the restaurant and bar is fantastic. Would recommend this restaurant and bar to anyone visiting Singapore who is looking for something a little special without having to break the bank
3
Celebrated my birthday dinner at this restaurant, atmosphere is posh & comfortable, with great service & good food, serving portion is rather small though, we ended up ordering more dishes to ensure everyone have ample of food. Ended the evening with a stroll along the viewing deck enjoying its magnificent view. I do prefer this branch than it's seminkay's sea side branch in Bal
5
We recently visited Singapore and went to dinner at the Ku De Ta restaurant with another couple. The venue is quite incredible with the views over Singapore very special. The meal is served as sharing plates and is a great way to try numerous dishes.The dishes that we particularly liked were Tuna Tatare, Pork Lollipop, Roasted Salmon, Prawn Tempura and Duck Breast.Service is friendly and efficient. The wine list is extensive.The restaurant is excellent if visiting Singapore or for a special occasion dinner
5
I am not sure why some say this has closed, but I had lunch their hair last week, with an industry colleague. This is located atop the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino, with Infinity pool and beyond. Spectacular lunch. Spectacular view. Some areas for viewing and the pool, of course, were restricted to hotel guests only. But the restaurant provided great views and food.
4
This is a great place to hang out with friends, or bring business associates to show off the best iconic views of Singapore city to your overseas clients. But expect crowds, if you are looking for a quiet place to have serious talks or close some deals, this might not be the ideal place.Everything is good, the food and the drinks/cocktails. Price is on the high side though, with a min spending of $80 per pax. Plays nice house music and there is a dance floor for you to groove. Do make reservations as the walk in waiting line can be long and frustrating. One point to note.. Security check is intense, starting from the waiting line at the hotel lobby til the restaurant entrance. Note that they do have a dress code, so flipflop, shorts, and singlets are strict no nos
5
I booked this restaurant three weeks in advance. When we arrived, people who didn't have reservations were being turned away or given a later table seating time.The staff were helpful and attentive. We were served by Ken who explained the restaurant food to us and also checked for us on the different ingredients of various cocktails. I had the Ku de ta Negroni, and the barman, Sly, concocted a Sazerac for us which was a new one for us to try.The view of the Singapore skyline was amazing and there was an inhouse restaurant DJ also (best job ever!!). We ordered the shiitake mushroom salad, smoked salmon tempura sushi, Hokkaido scallops and wok kai lan. We shared a goma pudding for dessert, with sakura blossom tea.It was a great way to spend an evening in Singapore
1
terrible experience!!!to be fair, i can;t say anything about the food because i didn't eat here and i will never!but i know from friends who live in Singapore that this place is definitely not worth visiting if you plan to have good food. my personal experience was a nightmare!we made a reservation on the phone and WE WERE NOT TOLD ABOUT THE DRESS CODE. so when we got there, hungry and tired after a long day at work, we were not allowed in by A VERY RUDE MANAGER. she just said no with an evil grim on her face and walked us out because my boyfriend was wearing shorts. too bad the person who took the reservation on the phone never told us about a dress code!!! but she wouldn't even listen to us!!!my boyfriend and I were mortified and felt very humiliated. The manager showed complete lack of manners and respect. AWFUL EXPERIENCE!!

The food at Ku De Ta is good. Like so many restaurants, the appetizers (raw and rolls) were better than the mains, but everything was quite good. We started with Bluefin tuna sashimi and beef tataki, both excellent quality and taste. Mains of seared scallops and venison were both very good; the scallops could have used a little more seasoning, but they were perfectly seared, plump, not overcooked. Mains come unaccompanied; if you want side dishes, you must purchase them. The side dishes are for sharing, with a serving size large enough for three or four people. We chose green asparagus and shiso flower fried rice as sides. The asparagus was overpowered by the yuzu dressing, and the rice was flavorful but kind of dry. We had some trouble with the wine list, as our first three choices for bottles were sold out, but the sommelier graciously worked with us to find a suitable bottle. Service started out a little shaky, but then PJ took over our table, and she was dynamite, full of enthusiasm and really taking care of us, filling our wine and water glasses, being attentive but not overly so. After the struggle with the wine list and the inexperience of our first server, PJ's cheerful attitude turned the night around for us. Thanks, PJ!The view made the night totally worthwhile. We reserved a table for 6:00, knowing that sunset was at just after 7:00, and we arrived early to ensure a table on the sunset side of the room, since specific tables cannot be reserved and are offered on a first-come/first-served basis. The doors of the restaurant do not open until 6:00; if you arrive early, you can have a drink at the bar and enjoy the view from all sides, but as your reservation time approaches, you need to go to the reception desk at the restaurant to have yourself seated, as no one approached us at the bar to seat us. Go early to ensure a table where you prefer - inside, outside, harbor or sea. Minimum spend is 80 SGD per person, which is easily met with entrÃ©e, side dish, and one drink, but with appetizers, wine, and dessert, our bill far exceeded that. The atmosphere is romantic enough for a couples dinner, suitably impressive for a business meal, and lively enough to enjoy with a group of friends. Overall, I would rate Ku De Ta 4 for food, 4.5 for service, 5 for atmosphere. If you are in Singapore, this is an iconic spot that just should not be missed
5
Great place to lounge during a sunset & enjoy a drink or two.
Perfect roof-top restaurant with breathtaking view of the city.
Stay a little longer & watch the Laser Light show. What a place!
When in Singapore - I would never miss it.
5
This place has great food, one of one the best locations and views in the world. The tasting menu was so good you want to savor every bite! A perfect Saturday night!

This restaurant's location definitely attracts your attention, but foods are surprisingly good as well. We had sushi rolls and they didn't disappoint us. Rita, pour server, was fun, friendly and attentive. Price is on a high side, but location makes it acceptable.
1
We went there as a group of about 12 people planning on having drinks and watch sunset. The view is great, staffs are friendly but the cocktails are horribly bad. I watch when they were making my mojito and saw that it was pre-made in a plastic bottle. I notice all the cocktails are made (or shall I say poured) this way. Best get a bottle of beer or wine

I was torn on how to rate this place and kept clicking on 3 vrs 4 several times :)Here is a dilema:- What an amazing view and breathtaking experience to see the entire Singapore from the top of Marina Sands Bay. Service was lovely as well and drinks were very good.- Food was just OK, good solid yet not inspiring. But the price was whooping $430 SDG for 2 people having full dinner and 3 drinks total. That was much more then we spend at L'ATELIER de Joël Robuchon in Singapore the night before and the food there was amazing and several levels higher/better then here.That said I did settle on 4 because for such an expensive and touristy place they did OK and an experience overall was positive, however next time I will have dinner somewhere else and come here just for drinks and the vie

Had a drink at the bar which has amazing view, and then moved to the dinning room inside for digestion menu dinner, dinner consisted 13 dishes that came in four courses. Couldn't even think to walk after this, cause was quiet filling. The dress code to get in was very casual, I was over dressed I think.The dishes was beautiful made and designed to be share for two person. The wait staff was amazing, very attentive, the Italian guy which I wasn't sure as supervisor or manager was very caring too. Definitely will come back next time.Tips: try to get table near the windows
5
the view over Singapore was amazing, eating dinner with our group, with a view of most of the bay, we were sat outside on the terrace.Food was very good.Waiting staff extremely attractive but also skilled.Very expensive but when in Rome....You can't go to Singapore and not go here and Raffle

We went for our anniversary celebration last night and after been in Singapore for over one year we decide to visit KU DE TA… Could not be better!Food, view and the service were amazing. We got to seat right in front of Gardens by the Bay and Strait of Malacca, our food the “tasting menu” was the best because we got to try a little bit of everything!Our waitress Vincent got 20 point from us! We was pleasant, helpful and great photographer  At the end they surprised us with a great chocolate lava desert with flames that said Happy 7th Year Anniversary!We definitely are coming back
2
Had to make reservations to eat fired food course after course. Only saving item was grilled shrimp on spinach salad. Overpriced and crowded. Could not even walk outside to see view. Security guards only allowed hotel guests and we had to show keys for access. Reservation is timed you will be asked to leave if you stay over your 2 hr window
5
The view, food, and service was amazing! I made our reservation one month in advance and let them know it was our anniversary dinner. They gave us the best seat in the house and after dinner they brought out a desert with flames that said Happy Anniversary. It was so nice that they remembered that from the initial reservation email so long ago! The food was delicious. Between the food, breathtaking views of the city, ambiance, and excellent service, I think this is my favorite restaurant ever. Next time I am in Singapore I will definitely go back here

I first visited KU DE TA this time. Food,view and service was all great. I want to visit there again later!! And it was so helpful that korean step was there. Scarlett thank you:)
5
I have first visited KU DE TA this time. Foods, view and services were all great. KU DE TA was the best place than i've been before. And it was so helpful in that Korean step was there!! Thanks Scarlett:)
4
Great place, nice hospitality and magnificent view from the top.
Get the seating outside then it is totally cool.
I do find the choice of vegetarian dishes were too less, atleast here it should be more!
Staff were very nice and friendly. Great ambience
5
I had the pleasure of dining at Ku De Ta today - amazing food with an amazing view. Impeccable service by Rita, all of my complex drinks and numerous allergy requests were handled perfectly!
Thank you Ku De Ta team!
5
We only had drinks but they were good, the bartender knows how to mix. The view from the top is amazing, one of those places, if in Singapore you have to go.
5
Went here tonight and couldn't be happier. We asked for a table outside and they have us one at the edge with views over the gardens at night which are amazing. We found both the food and the service top notch and the views really are the best in Singapore. It's s bit pricy but you get what you pay for and it was worth every cent.
4
WE had some family over from Australia and we thought that Ku De Ta was an ideal venue for a brunch. It turned out to be a very good choice. It is not the typical Singapore brunch in that you don't have to leave your table the staff bring the entree and mains to you. The Ruinart Champers was delightful and free flowing which is always nice.Rita looked after us and when she found out that our guests had just arrived for a visit she brought a lovely welcome to Singapore desert.All in all a great brunch, venue, food, wine and service were all top shelf
4
When we dined here and the food was good but not outstanding, and to make the most of it you really need to dine outside. In retrospect it may have been just as good to drink here as to dine but it was still a great experience. The bar outside would be great for sunset drinks
5
I was quite surprised a tourist attraction like this would have such excellent food. Our party of 4 shared the truffle edamame, beef tenderloin, ribeye, spicy sashimi salad, asparagus, udon noodles, and spicy tuna roll. The tuna roll was the best I've ever had and we ordered a 2nd. The red sangria was delicious and my husband said his Old Fashioned was the best he's ever had and he ordered a 2nd! Our waitress Rita was very helpful with menu suggestions. She showed the perfect amount of attentiveness and was always right there if you looked back and needed something. The whole experience was fantastic and we even went on a hazy night. Would definitely recommend it to anyone
5
This is my second visit to this restaurant the first one was a few years ago and was part of the office dinner so was a different experience from the personal one.I had booked this restaurant online for my wife's birthday with the request that they give me a table facing the bay . They lived up to my expectation when we reached the restaurant saying we have the bay view table as requested . My wife was super thrilled by the view of the gardens by the bay and the singapore flier .For food we ordered some sushi , rice and noodles which were awesome with the collection of really good sake the restaurant offers . Remember the restaurant requires you to have a billing of 80 SGD per person so can't be a daily visit place . The biggest surprise was when we ordered the dessert one of them came with a sparkler and happy birthday written on the plate . My wife was very surprised and loved every bit of this lovely experience and needless to say their desserts were awesome.I will highly recommend this inspite of the price for an experience to remember and view to die for .One more thing to remember is you have to dress formals . The good part is all the instructions come with your reservation email so take a few moments to read that .The service is very prompt and the waiters very friendly . Post dinner we got some fantastic view if the CBD area too from the restaurant
5
Asian fusione cuisine in a very high level. Very good service. Fast serving. Sensitive to special requests. The restaurant located on the roof of Marina bay tower with awsum view of all Singapore.
5
Service was very good and fast. Waiters there was really helpful and thoughtful. Food and ambience was amazing. I would like to come back again
5
WE really enjoyed our experience at KU DE` TA sitting atop of the Marina bay Sands!
We tried the 3 course tasting plate which was well priced at $48 per person.
Our only complaint would be the overpriced wines.
3
They have an interesting twist to their maki rolls: california, vegetarian, and re smoked salmon were deliciousTheir grilled shrimp salad is really good: the shrimps have a barbecue taste to them that made them really goodThe view is niceMake sure to book with them via email because we booked 3 weeks ago via phone but when we got there they had no record of it, but found us a table anywayNice music and outdoor are

Ku de Ta is one of those places that seems to land on the must see list. As expected the views are fantastic and service was good, but the food was average and way over priced. It may be better to plan to go there for a drink rather than a meal. Part of the restaurant is outdoors on the deck, but there is one section of viewing deck that is restricted to hotel guests with a snarky security guard preventing diners from looking from that area. After spending $100 on a small and alcohol free lunch, that seemed a bit chintzy. But still worth going for the view of the harbour and the amazing number of boats therein
4
We would not go here on a regular basis as the food was not that great for the price. This said, our lunch was good and the view was spectacular. The atmosphere was lovely and the staff were prompt and attentive. Overall, it is great as a one-time experience if you are a visitor to Singapore or if you are entertaining someone new to the city
5
Located on top of the spectacular Marina Bay Sands hotel, this attractive resturant provides excellent food and a great view of Singapore, the sea on one side the city on the other. It is particularly beautiful at sunset and into the evening when Singapore is lit up. Good food with a good choice. Great place to spend an evening
3
it has to be done went to the top and thought as we were there it would be rude not to have a cheeky beer the views from the top are stunning and great photo opportunities inc the infinity pool .only place I saw Hoegarden Rose beer which was very nic
3
both a restaurant and a club, but i never went there for the food, only to club. it gets really crowded at night even on a weekday. really good atmosphere if you want to soak in the club scene but if you're there just for the view, it's more advisable to have an early dinner
4
Went in the evening, had a nice meal (degustation), quail eggs and other fancy food, very nice. The bar is way too small and hard to get a drink (ok once we had our table, nice service, but the food was served way too fast (turnover name of the game). A bit draughty but you are high up, worth a look, or take the "flyer" if views are all you want
5
Not on ls is this a great iconic spot to have your dinner the staff, service and food are also extremely good. There is a decent selection of foods to have and a wine list to suit all wallets.
5
Fantastic Location and atmosphere, Excellent service and Really Magnificent Food!
The service from the hostesses in particular, Rita was fantastic and really added to the enjoyment of the night.
We will be back as soon as we can.
Daniel and Tracy

This is a great restaurant and the views are stunning. It is a tad on the expensive side ($200 per person for food and drink) but well worth it. The food is very high quality and there is a good variety. Service is extremely good.
1
You either have to pay to get up to just take in the view (22Spd per person) or book a table/take a drink in the restaurant. We booked a table in the restaurant - minimal charge of 88spd per person. Our food was very greasy and we sent one dish back as it was cold. Feedback to the F&B manager and was told sorry but the restaurant was particularly busy during our service and was offered a free drink. Not that we were looking for any freebies - we declined the offer. Don't waste your money on the food experience as you will be disappointed
2
The whole visit didn't get of to a great start. Girl at reception downstairs couldn't or wouldn't want to answer some simples questions. Put it down to poor training. Got upstairs to the restaurant and booked a table for 1.5hrs later as we were waiting for a friend and wanted to spend some time in the bar to enjoy the view. When we got to the bar we were told we couldn't sit down as they were preparing for dinner. Despite me telling the girl at reception that this was our plan at no time did anyone tell us we couldn't sit in the bar. After asking the staff if the expected us to stand up for 1.5hrs we were met with a lot of shoulder shrugging. After nearly loosing my good temper somebody pointed us to another part which had a bar. Service there was equally shocking. Staff were on their mobiles watching videos, chatting amongst themselves and taking forever to bring drinks. All in all a very poor showing! However, dont let me put you off...go and enjoy the view which is 5 star just don't expect the service to match the view!
5
For about the same price as the admission to the Marian Bay Sands Sky park, you can visit the Ku de ta bar for a cocktail and take in the absolutely jaw dropping view from the cocktail terrace.We went at twilight and watched the sun set and all the lights come on. Totally beautiful and a really memorable experience. Yes it was expensive - about $25 for the one drink, but pretty much a once in a lifetime experience. They do not seem to hassle you to move on or order more drinks, so you can spin out one drink into an hour or so of taking in the view and checking out all the beautiful people
5
Excellent staffs, tasty food, bit over priced drinks and food, nice atmosphere.If you want to go for the view do not pay or buy tickets.Just try to get into the restaurant, and ask for s smoking place. They will direct you to the ku de ta bar which is on the same deck but back of the elevators u used to get to the restaurant.Anyone can use the bar anytime and the view is available on the bar. You don't have to pay any extra penny just to see the view.Went on for lunch n it worked
5
Simply the beat fusion cuisine in Singapore!The menu have variety, all kind of ingredients and mixes; the final result os always the best: tasty and interesting. As a local, I had tryed it diferent times and is always a surprise.The drinks are quite expensive (normal here), but we always order a diferent every time just to try something new, before go to the table (ask for a table by the window).Gotta love Ku De Ta
1
Me and my mate went to Ku De Ta for their ladies' night and were greeted by a very rude bouncer at the ground level who gave terse, uninformative answers to our very simple, harmless questions. When we reached the top we were instantly herded like cattle towards the bar where we were commanded to receive our cocktail and not permitted to first simply take a look around (we were at the top of Marina Bay Sands! We wanted to have a look at the magnificent view). The general atmosphere was one of artificiality and vapidity. Neither of us enjoyed our time there
2
I booked the restaurant as it was my husband's birthday. When we arrived, there was so many hostesses at the front greeting us (does a restaurant really need 4 hostesses?). service was confusing as as had 2 waiters in our area serving us - it would have been better to have 1 waiter throughout, especially at a fine dining restaurant. the decor was alright, not fabulous. the booth seat is uncomfortable. the food - they are trying way too hard and not getting the right results. i had the seared tuna, and it made my mouth swollen. my husband also was not impressed with the food. I have been to alot of mid-range restaurants that have served much better food
5
No reservation necessary, a great way to get to the top of Marina Bay Sands hotel. That infinity pool! Expensive, but the view makes up for it.
3
Food was very good - service mediocre-ambience was alright - table setting could have been better. The company made it an experience though.
Will definitely come back for the food though
4
Went for a couple of drinks with a colleague yesterday. Unfortunately, we were not allowed outside due to the adverse conditions (Heavy rain) so no chance to experience the views.
However, we enjoyed our drinks and of course the efficient and very attractive staff!
4
Had a refreshing cocktail while looking at a panoramic view of Singapore before dinner. Great ambience and the Oriental cuisine is good. Must book in advance.
5
Amazing experience. View of the fireworks was spectacular! :)
Only downside drinks are a little expensive.
4
Absolutely stunning views from the balcony. Great if you can be there before sunset as you will see Singapore in daylight and then when the lights come on. Good drinks and good wine here along with tasty food. Every expensive, so keep an eye on the pursestrings
5
Expensive, but then again most places in Singapore are expensive. Expect to pay around S$25 for a glass of wine...the view makes it totally worth it! Access to the pool is for hotel guests only, but anyone is welcome for lunch or drinks. Open from 12pm daily, cover charge from 9pm onwards, otherwise free entrance. A definite recommendation! Tip: the entrance is at the far end of the marine bay hotel on ground level....take the lift to the 57th floor (there are hosts standing at the entrance to assist if you are unsure
3
I was very excited being invited for dinner to Ku De Ta and make an effort to dress up. Upon reaching the 57th level and entrance to the restaurant, I was disappointed. I looked around and there is no WOW factor - the interior dÃ©cor was so common, so unimpressive, the serving staff was okay - the polite smile, things were served quietly and efficiently. Some dishes were delicious, some were okay, but nothing to make you wanting to go back for more. Portion was small, no fantasy display as I would expected from a fine dining Japanese influenced restaurant. We ordered the pork belly, lamb, teriyaki chicken, fried rice, salad, sushi and rolls and salmon which was ridiculous for the portion at that pricing - 2 small pieces about 4cm x 5cm with 2-3 pieces of radish and a lime or lemon (too dark to see the difference) on a big plate. The poor salmon looked 'so lost'. We finished the meal with dessert - okay nothing to shout about. As for the view, it looked spectacular. I was aware of the limitation a dining guest can go, so I am not complaining. I would sum it up that if you want the view, then pay for the view which allows you to walk round and spend about 30-60 minutes to go "wow'' and take pictures. To pay about S$100 per pax for an average meal with limited view is definitely not a good option
5
went there for my very first time and my conclusion they have stunning view of city in the night, its awesome and perfect for photos and also sunset if there's no cloud its might be good.very nice ambience, super friendly staff . price for food are bit pricey but i assume you pay the view. drinks are excellent. its one of attraction others traveller can do. while for other who are in budget you simply can visit from other area which you have to pay the entrance but my recommendation better go to KU DE TA , zip few drinks and enjoy the bling bling of Singapore. very well done team ! i will be bac
2
Dined with few friends, we ordered 2 type of maki and other food. I am very disappointed with the maki as they are cold and chilled. I ask the service staff why is the maki cold and chilled and she told me that the maki had been stand by from the afternoon all the way till the night as the chef are very busy with alot of order and had no time to do fresh maki. I cant believe it as ku de ta is a very class and expensive restaurant but they cant serve fresh maki, I wonder is all the food also been standb
4
There are better restaurants in Singapore but few with better views. The MBS is crowded, touristy and yet we really enjoyed our dinner on the patio overlooking the city. This restaurant exceeded our expectations and we had a lovely dinner outside. The sashimi was excellent and the halibut was tasty. The food is good and the ambiance makes it a worthwhile visit
3
We visited Ku De Ta for lunch last month. We opted for the set lunch menu which was plentiful and tasty though it wasn't as impressive as we'd hoped. It was a very expensive meal but it certainly wasn't the meal we remember or favoured. It is easy to see the attraction to this restaurant - the location is wonderful with beautiful views of Singapore on a sunny day. Staff arranged for us to enjoy our coffee and dessert on the deck which was a nice touch, but would probably only return for drinks in the future.
4
We dined here with two friends, who were celebrating their wedding anniversary.The setting is lovely, on the 57 floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, with stunning views. (We arrived whilst it was still daylight and loved the changing light until darkness fell and all the lights of Singapore came on - a breathtaking panorama).As one would expect for a hotel of this standard, alcohol and food are expensive but worth the cost, with delicious taste experiences.Service is attentive, however, my one criticism is that I had to ask the waitress to wait until I had finished eating as she started to clear my companions' plates whilst I was still eating; this may be regarded as acceptable service in Singapore but I hate it.We had a great time at Ku De Ta and I would recommend it without hesitation
4
I came here for a dinner - the place is quite dark so they have to give you little lights to see the menu. The food is quite creative and actually very tasty ( especially the sashimi salad) but small portions. Service was attentive and typically (good) Singapore standards.I think for a special occasion this is a good place - low light, great location and good food - but it's quite expensive.
2
Marina Bay Sands is an impressive structure no doubt, but throughout it needs cleaning, and is ridiculously expensive.Take a photo from the ground, the view is better from the Singapore flyer anyway
4
We had the pleasure to enjoy a memorable dinner in one of Singapores best places with tasty food, nice atmosphere and inspiring people. Besides the breathtaking view of the skyline we would especially thank Pj for her attentive and extraordinary service - giving us the feeling being special guests. The quality of food was delicious - it was expensive but worth it. We look forward visiting this place again and being guests of Pj on her "private terrace". (@Pj enjoy a beautiful vacation with your loved ones, have a safe trip and please come back soon to KuDeTa)
5
It was definitely a wonderful experience at the restaurant. The view was amazing with helpful staff, in particular to Mr Fabio who provided us top notch service in every expects. The food was nice and will surely revisit the restaurant in the near future. Thumbs up!
5
We came to KuDeTa Restaurant and sky bar as a honeymoon treat while in Singapore. I can honestly say it was such a special experience because our waitress made it so special for us, Rita was the best, she took care us and made sure we had an amazing time. She gave us a special dessert on the house and made recommendations of dishes we would enjoy. Well worth the money! We enjoyed a cocktail at the bar first and then a fabulous meal, after Rita got us a table outside so we could continue drinking:) and watch the light show. The best honeymoon treat we have experienced! Loved every moment. This is a must do for anyone visiting Singapore.
1
If you come for the view, you are not allowed to go to the main deck ($20 extra!). If you come for the food of the French chef, you'll be very disappointed: 2 small prawns on a bed of 10 spinach leaves is my starter, a piece of salmon the size of 3 sashimis is my main course, but good chocolate fondant for dessert. If you come for the service, it might be terrible: after waiting our main course for more than 30 minutes (we were only 2 or 3 tables as we arrived early), the manager did not apologize for the long waiting time. Not good experience. Only come here for the show off of climbing at the top of the MBS attraction, but without the vertigo..
4
Superb venue - amazing location, on roof of Marina Bay Sands Hotel, with incredible views.But, that is just a bonus to what is a fantastic dining experience - the food it exquisite. We went for Saturday Brunch. fixed Menu, with lots of courses and lots to eat. Food was prepared and presented to the highest standard, and tasted delicious. The high standards were matched by the excellence of service. Our server, Lily, was a delightful young Chinese lady. She was attentive, friendly and polite. She had a great deal of knowledge about the menu and was very helpful, providing advice and assistance. She ensured that our drinks were always replenished and that the different courses were served on-time, with skill and humour. Xei Xei Lily.Her colleague, Sitra, took some great photos of us. We really enjoyed every aspect of our dining experience and will have fond memories of our Brunch - would recommended this restaurant to all "foodies"
5
Really stunning views. Outstanding ambiance. Excellent service for food and wine. Every dish was served beautifully and everyone at the table was thrilled. Little pricey but hey, Singapore + iconic building + not-everyday-experience ....
I say go for it!!!!
5
we wanted to see the view and were not disappointed. had a few drinks up there, a bit on the pricey side, but the wine ordered was superb. had to wait for a table. overall a good experience.
3
to be honest other than the view (which was lovely) there's not much to write home about! drinks are a tad pricey.. it's a good place for a bunch of friends to meet and hang out.. regular bar/hangout
4
The bar and restaurant is at the top of Marina Bat Sands Tower Three.
The view of Singapore is spectacular.
As always such views come at a price. Beer and wines start at around S$24
5
Nice ambience, good food, great service, especially Jess's service. You can see the whole Singapore night scene from here! Top notch!
4
i was there few days back and was wonderful..the view is amazing and lovely atmosphere..also my compliments for the staff,very helpful and with positive attitude..if I'm not wrong his name was Apac..he took many pictures for me and also told me about the special events from ku de ta :) thank you for the nice experience !!
4
We had dinner at Ku De Ta by chance. With such an amazing view and such a "touristy" spot, we had lowish expectations for the food quality. The items we ordered were amazing with much larger servings than we anticipated. Service provided by Ken was great. It was pricey but you do pay for the location.Would certainly go back
5
Went to top of the Singapore at 57 floor for great dinner at MBS. Awesome view both the city and the sea view. We had the sea view and our server was Akbar, great service and good recommendation on food and drinks. The baby squid, tuna roll, beef tataki is a must try. Storm cooler and green garden were awesome. Our waiter Akbar recommended all this and thank you for taking care of us, will be back for sure

I stayed at Marina Bay Sands hotel with work.The top floor is a bit like a theme park, there are queues to get in sometimes and areas roped off all over the place, so it's easy to get lost up there. There are several bar and restaurant areas, some are pre-booked only, others are open. I found it hard to navigate around, and had arranged to meet a colleague but we had no chance of meeting each other. The first night I wanted a quick drink and to check email before I met a colleague but could not find space to put a laptop down. Eventually I was shown to an indoor bar area and was given a place at the bar but told I would have to order food to sit there. As a resident this was a little disappointing (there's no preference for residents over non residents except it's free to get up there). So if you're planning a meeting up there, plan in advance and book. Additionally, one evening our CEO joined us for drinks but we were declined a table with a view unless we committed to a S$500 spend. As our company is privately owned, and our CEO had put up around 50 staff in the hotel with a spend of approx US$100k-200k, I thought this was a little unreasonable. Eventually we were given a table away from the edge (as opposed to a stand up high table - having been at an event the last 3 days our feet were killing us). The nicer tables at the edge of the terrace remained empty the rest of the evening.But for a casual drink it's fantastic, the service is great, great choice of drinks, the staff are just lovely and of course the view is amazing
4
I ate here tonight for a business dinner with my wife and her client. Not cheap but the food was good and the service excellent and unobtrusive. Paired with a drink in the bar (on the other side of he lift lobby) before it is a great a venue to bring people from out of town to. The key here is having an expense account
5
Ku De Ta is a lovely restaurant with a magnificent view of Singapore at Marina Bay Sands. Not to miss their delicious and excellent priced offer during lunch time. We appreciate very much Lily's attention and service. She was very professional and very nice.
5
A great bar with amazing views. Sure it costs a bit but if you can afford it then definitely worth a visit. I was visiting on business and we had a great night out
5
Ku De Ta was an amazing restaurant and the waitress Rita was amazing and making the night a night remember.
4
We went to this bar/restaurant at lunchtime and the view is breathtaking. The areais both inside ( in aircon) and outside under big umbrellas. We sat out and had a drink which is not cheap - about $25 for wine and beer. We then decided to have the tasting lunch which consisted of four tasting plates and it was delicious. It was quite enough and priced at $ 48 plus plus. If you go later in the day you can watch the sun set which is spectacular. But BOOK
3
Ku De Ta in Marina Bay Sands is horrible. Service is terrible, the waitresses and waiters really need lessons on service
5
We had an excellent dinner and thumbs up for ARLAN, one of the hosts who graciously showed us around the resto/bar and we were mesmerized by the spectacular view of the city of Singapore with partly peek of Indonesia. AMAZING experience! We will definitely come back to this resto/bar
5
Made a reservation from the hotel, was ushered in as soon as I arrived. No delay there. Provided a table with a view and what a fabulous view it is. Food was awesome - black cod, possibly one of the best I have ever had, Salmon Sashimi in their own marination - Super. Asked for a seat outside in the Skybar for a drink after the meal- was escorted by the manager to a seat with a view, obviously reserved for dining customers of the restaurant or outside at Skybar. Found the waiting staff to be precise in their work, available and polite but not over the top which is the way I prefer. Expensive - yes of course, but worth it? Absolutely for me. Wud go back any day.
5
A great view of Singapore, but you will pay for it. The food is excellent and the view is great. If you get a table at the restaurant and surpass the minimum spend (I think it is S$50 per person, but could be S$80) then you don't have to pay for access to the rooftop. The other option is to pay S$23/pax to get to the rooftop and then you can go to the bar. At S$25 / drink you will not have a problem covering the minimum spend, so reserve a table and enjoy one of the most spectacular views from a restaurant in the world
5
Ku De Ta Club Lounge is on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands (MBS), and offers the best views in Singapore! One way is to go to the viewing deck of the MBS by paying $23. The other is to go to the reception desk of Ku De Ta in tower 3 of MBS and say that you're going to Ku De Ta for a drink. It helps if its a weekday (less rush), you're smartly dressed (no shorts/sandals/singlets) and definitely helps if you're a couple. On being given a pass by the hostess, you zoom up via an exclusive elevator and pop out the 57th floor, hand your pass to the attendant and head straight for the outside bar, which is one floor above the viewing deck. There's an indoor restaurant too, but you're here for the views, right? The bar will usually be crowded and there's standing room plus a few tall tables only. The sit-down section is roped-off and is kept for prior reservations. Take in the awesome views. Order a drink only if you want to, because they're expensive (a cocktails-$23++!). As far as I could tell, no one checks if you're having a drink or not, but if you've come up all the way, a drink or two will definitely put you in a mood to enjoy
5
The place is just amazing. If you get up to the bar you dont have to pay the entry fee. All you need to do is buy a drink. Of course drinks are a bit more expensive than in other bars and restaurants but its worth it. Unless you dont like to see the amazing view over singapour from 171 meters above. The waiters were really funny and gave us a table, which normally has a min. conusumation of 500 SGD, for free because it wasnt that busy that sunday. In addition they also offered us a glas of champagner :) We had a great time up there and defenetly will visit that place again if well return to singapour one day!:) Must see bar! Thank you Akbar and Faraq for your kindness!:) Best waiters in town ;
5
Great food and great service in an awesome place to dine is a perfect combination.
Truly an experience worth remembering!!!

Amazing evening with family at ku de ta. Sat outside looking at the view, chill out music from live dj and simply stunning food. A bit pricey but the view is worth the price tag!!
Very special!

I visited Singapore for a short stay after a break of 12 years. The Marina Bay area was non-existent then. I decided to head out to the area to take some photos...on the way I looked up the restaurant options on Tripadvisor and Ku De Ta roused my curiosity...I made my way into the vast lobby of the Marina Bay Sands and after asking, was directed to the entrance of Ku De Ta at the base of tower 3. I was delighted to be able get a table at such short notice. I took the lift to the 57th floor and was immediately impressed by the layout and the views across Singapore and into Malaysia. It helped that it was a beautifully, clear afternoon.The menu is spectacular...I was really tempted by the " World Gourmet Summit Tasting Menu " but being on my own this was not an option. I settled on the Bento option. The meal was beautifully prepared and presented. The Bento consisted of: edamame, cucumber, tomatoes in ponzu sauce, salmon sashimi, shrimp sushi rolls, shrimp tempura, grilled black cod, steak with udon, akadashi miso soup with shimeiji mushrooms, and rice accompanied by a glass of Hawkes Bay Chardonnay.The only disappointment was that Sake was not available in small 180ml flasks and only in 750ml bottles....Service matched the experience - attentive without being obtrusive. Then of-course there is the view...it is worth taking a walk around the perimeter of the deck to take in all the perspectives on Singapore

57 floors up in about 45 seconds is a trip, but the view even better. We didn't eat here, but were lucky enough to be able to get in the bar for a drink. Be warned, they are expensive - about $10 a beer, although from what I saw you did not have to buy anything, so a cheap way of getting to the top of Marina Bay sands without paying the $23 viewing platform fee. Access is limited, and you need to find queue in tower 3 and state you're going up for a drink and smile sweetly! Good luck
4
The best thing about this restaurant is its location - top level of the spectacular Marina Bay Sands hotel. If you get a seat near the window area you will get a view. So request a table with a view. Where we sat, however, I had no view, and in my direct line of sight was a guard who didn't look very happy. Also, there was alot of noise. The service was very professional and prompt, the food was good and fresh (and exoensive - there is a minimum spend of $80pp), but nothing to rave about, and the wine prices were over the top. The outdoor bar area was packed and you get the great view, so it would probably be worth it to just have a drink at the bar instead of a meal
4
The view was WOW! I enjoyed my cocktails so much and also had romantic dinner with my boyfriend. Once the food enters your mouth you can tell that they use very high-quality ingredients. The taste was excellent. Staffs were friendly but not really helpful. I spent around SGD200 for dinner and cocktails
5
Very nice atmosphere, was busy with a lot of trendy people having a casual drink. All aspects of this visit was on point and the quality of the ingredients were excellent. If I must have a gripe about something, maybe the lighting over the dinner table could be a tad brighter, but that's really it. Oh and the view is spectacular.
5
Don't just look up in awe at the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel - get in the lift and go up to Ku De Ta. As the other reviews have stated, it is worth it for the views alone, but the food is actually very good. Wine is a little expensive, with the cheapest bottle about S$95, but what a meal! and what an experience! Even when my credit card bill arrives, I won't regret it

My husband made a reservation to this restaurant and asked me to marry him half way through our meal,and of course the answer is gonna be very yes.thanks to the helpful staff who took lots of pictures of him kneeling down in one knee.thank you for helping us capturing the very happy moments we had while dining in.We do appreciate the free glass champagne that night. This place has everything that you could ask for. Great service, excellent food, amazing view.If your looking for a place to bring your date, this place is highly recommended as everyone will appreciate how nice the location is. It's overlooking to everything in Singapore! Five star!!!

Recommend by the concierge we visited for drinks at sunset and then came back later for dinner.
Amazing view, excellent service and really good modern Asian food.
Would definitely go back & recommend.
4
Awesome drinks, great view, nice and relaxed environment
I would highly recommend it. One of the bar tenders was not very friendly, but his colleague was super nice, so thank to him we had another 2 cocktails
5
Worth a visit - go to the bar on the rooftop Ku De Ta, view is worth the price of a cocktail. The whole marina is great viewing and shopping
5
Excellent Japanese meal on the 57 Floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Forget the SkyPark and head for the top floor with fine dinning and a view to savour.
4
This is a good bar to come back to in terms of drink. I love the ambience of the roof-top bar, the drink is good and delivered altogether with good performance from the bartender. Mr Skyle (not sure if I spell the name right) has always amazed us with his skillful "performance" mixing our cocktail. And thw cocktail tastes just right.This is always my first and immediate choice is I'm around CBD area!Cheers,Than
5
One of the coolest places to grab a drink in Singapore - amazing views of the skyline, straits, and sunset. Sure you pay a premium, but so did the tourists who are up there on the Sky Deck - but you have a drink in hand, and they don't. Only went to the bar, so can't comment on the food or quality of the restaurant

This restaurant is truly SPECTACULAR! My mother and I dined here for her 60th birthday and I am so glad that we did. Firstly our flight was delayed, however the staff were able to accommodate a later booking time. The staff were very attentive and provided us with brilliant service throughout the night, their attention to detail was remarkable and they supplied us with things like handbag hooks to ensure our bags didn't have to be placed on the floor. The food was exquisite, we sampled many dishes and were at a loss to select a favourite, however the surprise dessert which read "happy 60th birthday" made my mum's night. After dinner we headed out onto the deck to enjoy the breathtaking view! Such a special location. Truly blessed to have dined at such a wonderful place. Many thanks
5
We have just finished our incredible dinner at Ku De Ta and I have to thank the staff for providing us with a fantastic experience. The drinks at the bar, the exclusive views, the wine and the food were all good surprises. We have ordered the tasting menu, which I strongly reccomend. It is not cheap (beer for 16, drinks for 25 and wines starting at 100), but it is worth it if you are not staying at Marina Bay Sands, cause it provides you with the full experience
5
I went to Ku De Ta Skybar on few occasions with my friends while staying in Singapore. We had a great night there, the atmosphere is great, the view on the city spectacular, music top notch and the cocktails delicious. My special thanks to the bar team ( Jay (Miguel), Sly, Leonard, Amir & Albar) for being friendly, professional and for preparing the best cocktails in Singapore. Bravo!
5
We were there for their Brunch Buffet. The Brunch Buffet was amazing and there's also an an ala carte menu to order from. It was not an inexpensive meal but if you are a good eater, this place is value for money. The restaurant and views were beautiful and the service was excellent.It was quite an experience. I will surely go there again when I visit Singapore next time
4
A must when in Singapore.Good food, excellent service .Wounderful atmosphere We were made to feel very welcome by the lovely Rita.Not forgetting the views they are spectacular
4
Have a drink at the lounge club and a bite at the restaurant. Tower 3.You pay for the view, but the food is all right.
Personally I prefer a drink at the rooftop bar in tower 1. Much more relaxed and less crowded.
4
on the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sends in a dark romantic atmosphere (you get flash lighters with the menus)located one of the best restaurants of Singapore! Oriental dishes with some European touches combined gourmet food. almost every dish was glorious and tasty (except for the desert which was not at the same standard) the special roles the rice the Shrimps everything (we shred the courses) even our children loved it and we ordered additional dishes.3 remarks:a. the food is served much too quickly and we finished our starters and main courses within 40 minutes - one expects to spend a whole evening there and not a
5
We've been coming here for quite some time and I finally decided to complement the guys on this amazing place. Food is continuously good, drinks very well made and staff are pretty helpful. But you don't really come here for that but for the spectacular views from their 58th floor sky deck. Unrivaled in Singapore and pretty hard to match anywhere in the world. Come here right before the sunset, settle down, order a cocktail and enjoy. Bliss
3
Situated as it is, this is a must visit when you are in Singapore. But svae your money - the food is lousy, the drinks are weak and the music is sub-par.Head on up, order ONE drink if you must, take lots of selfies with the view and then head on out to the real clubs
3
We wanted to visit this restaurant because of recommendation from our travel agency and because of the great view. The food was very good and stuff was friendly but it was really expensive and for this price we were waiting something different. Restaurant was noisy and we didnt hear each other, the biggest disapointment was that when we wanted to go to the plattform to see the great view(thats why we went to the restaurant) and take pictures , the guard said its only for hotel guest. That was really not expected and we were all quite angry, they said us that we can take a picture from the restaurant, this view wasnt that thrilling and next thing was that we had to be taking pictures next to tables where people were eating, for me it was embarrassing and for them annoying, I think. After that someone from stuff told me I can go to the KU DE TA club and that there is a good view as well, i first went there alone and this view was much much better but there were so many people that it was hard to capture it. Then i called my parents to go there and take picture of them but they didnt let me in cause i didnt have ID to show them that I am 18. So if you want to go to this restaurant mostly because of the view, cancel your reservation as soon as possible, but besides this the restaurant is quite good
4
We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Ku De Ta on our recent trip to Singapore. We started with cocktails on the outside deck with amazing views of Singapore and the Straits. We started up a conversation with a woman visiting alone and she joined us for dinner. We all shared a whole bunch of different items and the food was very good with flashes of excellence
5
I went to the restaurant to have lunch with my husband on the 7th April. The experience was wonderful! The restaurant was very nice, ambiance was good and the food was tasty. The best part was the service. We were serviced by a girl called Jess, she was very sweet. She took great care of my husband and me made sure we felt comfortable and that our food was up to our standard. To top it up, she brought us wonderful chocolate lava cake for dessert, the melted center was amazing! after our lunch Jess also showed us aroudn the hotel since it was our first time dinning there. she brought us up to see the infinity pool which was great! the service was fantastic. we loved Jess and would definitely go back just for the service
5
We almost passed up Ku De Ta as being too touristy and expensive. We were glad we decided to go for lunch. The atmosphere is trendy and also friendly, which also describes Singapore itself. The food was good, as was the service, but the reason to go is for the stunning views of the city and ocean. It's just so memorable...unforgettable! We would highly recommend a visit to this unique spot

We decided to try this restaurant on our last night in Singapore for something a little special. The food was very good and the waiting staff were very friendly and very attentive. Overall the dining experience was nice.So why only three stars? Firstly, it's a little expensive, but that was expected, but what really disappointed us was the Marina Bay Sands and the security staff that felt that they were either staring in some Bond movie or straight out of the East German Stasi. Officious doesn't even come close to describing how rude these guys are. From the moment you get out of the cab to the point you get to the restaurant, you're treated like dirt off the bottom of their shoes. Then when you've finished your meal and decide you might like to try and visit the viewing platform just outside, you're bluntly told hotel guest only and it's going to cost you (a) the time to go back down 57 floors to buy a ticket and come back again, and (b) to run the Stasi Gauntlett along the way down and back up again.So a couple of pointers to the restaurant, either include the cost of the viewing platform tickets in your cover charge, or be very clear when people check in that they need to buy a ticket before going upstairs. One does not expect to be nickle'd and dime'd having spent in excess of $500 on a dinner for two. One certainly doesn't expect to be treated like criminals by hotel security. These guys need a stiff lesson in politeness...So in summary, restaurant good, location awful..
5
The restaurant is amazing! The view is breathtaking and the food is great! The service was also great, our waitress Rita did a great job!!
5
The view was awesome and really enjoyed the food and the drinks at ku De ta at 57th floor, Ali was excellent in his service, go to ku De ta for a wonderful experience.
4
Yes, the view is amazing. There is such great food to be had in Singapore, I would recommend lunch or drinks and apps. We had dinner which was good but not amazing as your can so easily find all over the City.
4
We were lucky enough to get a great table outside with incredible views of the city. The food was outstanding and the service from our waiter Ali was excellent.
4
The view from the restaurant is excellent. Its the 55th floor. It was slightly drizzling on that day which made it more fantastic. You have a section which is closer to the viewing deck. The night view is excellent from here.
3
You know in advance that prices will be expensive because you are dining with a unique perspective over Singapore. However if the restaurant wants to charge those prices then the staff should be very professional and courteous to match. We ordered a light lunch and drinks and the waiter said "is that all? in a very rude tone, not a courteous manner to enquire if there was anything else. Maybe they don't care thinking that most visitors will have a one off experience while on holiday. However we would not recommend it. Pay to go to the viewing platform. You can buy a drink from a kiosk and still get the same view without the rudness
5
I stopped in for a lunch on my short visit to Singapore just to get the bird eye's view of Singapore in its entirety all in one sitting. It was all I expected and more. The staff were super friendly, attentive and helpful, the view was fascinating and the food and cocktails were perfect. Had a wonderful experience, will be coming back again next time in town. Thanks for an amazing experience :

KU DÉ TA is on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel with a spectacular, worth repeating spectacular view of Singapore. This is, in my view, the primary attraction of this restaurant. To avoid disappointment make your reservation well in advance, request sitting on the rail (for the best view) and pray for good weather.All reservations are for a maximum of two hours, you are expected to give up the table at the end of this time period. The service is a bit slow especially the bar service so for a relaxing meal with a leisurely dessert get your order in promptly. They have an S$80.00 minimum per person but don't worry you will have absolutely no problem making the required minimum charge. There is a dress code "No shorts, slippers, singlets and tank tops" from 6:00 p.m. on.The food: our group had edamame and tomato salad for appetizer both were good but smallish servings. I would recommend sharing three appetizers for four people. Two if us had John Dory (fish) one had lamb chops and I had halibut. All were very good. However, at KU DÉ TA's prices one would expect excellent food and perhaps larger portions.We had cocktails (it took a while to explain what a manhattan is to our waitperson) and a bottle of wine with dinner. They were out of the wine we ordered and the sommelier recommended a similarly priced alternative which was very good. We shared a variety of three desserts which were all good. So, all in all, the dinner was very good as was the service and attentiveness especially as we neared our two hour limit.This is the second time we have eaten at KU DÉ TA (we were there about a year ago) and we enjoyed it both times. KU DÉ TA is a very good chic restaurant and quite expensive. One is paying for the view, reputation, and food in that order. It's worth a visit at least once
3
it was the fourth time, but sorry to say they food quality dropped big times. Not sure if they are relaxing on the name and reputation, but what I got tonight for 450 S$ for two person was not worth it at all. So better just go for a drink, but there are much better places in the world with the same food like ZUMA in Dubai or the LONG POOL at The Chedi Muscat.
5
Needless to say, as tourists we had to make our way to Marina Bay Sands for a bite to eat at Ku De Ta. This is not a cheap place to eat by any means but it's worth it, if not just for the jaw-dropping view of Singapore from the 50-somthing-th floor. Just stunning. We had some cocktails and small plates of various things brought out and everything was delicious. Fantastic atmosphere too :
5
The food, service and the great hospitality given by Lily made this a truly wonderful evening.
The location is great on top of Marina Bay Sands with a wonderful view over Singapore.
4
I can highly recommend this awesome nightclub at the top of MBS.
The view over the Marina Bay was breathtaking!
5
Bar with an excellent view and great cocktails and ambience.Was there in the evening/night with family and friends.can have a panoramic view of the city 360 deg.A must visit on your tricot Singapore.

Shortly after being kindly greeted and seated at our table, bad weather prevailed and tried to put a damper on our lunch, thankfully by the time we enjoyed our first course of which I had the lovely fried squid, the skies started to clear up. Being from Australia it was quite hard to find tasty red meat in Singapore that did not cost a fortune and stood up to the standards of our quality beef however the Wagyu beef was one of the tastiest and most tender pieces of beef I have ever tasted. To top off our great dining experience our friendly waiter Jess kindly brought out our gooey chocolate mud cake and she also was very accommodating and understood the severity of peanut allergies as one of our guest is allergic to peanuts. Overall the Ku De Ta restaurant offered an affordable fine dining experience that allows you to appreciate the breathtaking views of Singapore ~ Spectacular view, Fantastic food and Lovely servic
2
We went to the KU DE TA for a cocktail and to enjoy the views over Singapore. Unsurprisingly, the views are breathtaking. What did surprise me was the abysmal level of service at the hotel and the bar. Some members of staff were just down-right rude and have not been trained in customer service. Perhaps, this is because so many people come to the hotel that they really don’t care about service or repeat business. The hotel’s famous infinity pool looked amazing – but it was so crowded that it resembled a public beach rather than an exclusive hotel.Yes, go to the KU DE TA for the views and it is a ‘must do thing’ in Singapore. But expect bad service. By contrast, we went to the Long Bar at the Raffles – no views obviously, but the ambience is better, the staff friendlier and they do a killer Singapore Sling
5
With a free Sunday, I decided to head into town and ended up at Ku De Ta at MBS. I've actually been there a few times at the bar for a few drinks with friends but being on my own, I decided to sit in the restaurant and order a few bites and some wine. Considering the size of the restaurant and it's capacity, the quality of the food was pretty outstanding. I enjoying the Wagyu beef and especially the squid. Fried squid is pretty much a norm in Singapore but here it was exceptional. Wine by the glass were interesting which is testament to (Michael I think) who took the time to explain wines which were new to me. Great view, quality service backed up by really great food
5
We were fortunate enough to be staying for a few nights in this hotel and so we tried out this restaurant - it's location is stunning. I wouldn't have cared what I ate - or drank - it's just lovely. Make an effort to go even for just a drink.
5
Ku Da Ta was a terrific experience. The food was both innovative and delicious. Small serves which meant you could easily try a number of things. The staff were very attentive (Lily). And the view - quite wonderful. Wine list very expensive which limits consumption, which may not be a bad thing. I was annoyed that after spending time and money at the restaurant, that the guard immediately outside the exit wouldn't allow us onto the viewing platform to take pics. However plenty a decent vista from the restaurant terrace. An excellent experience that finished off a memorable holiday
4
The food at Ku De Ta was without doubt the best we had in Singapore. The staff were really welcoming and friendly. We had a set lunch menu, which was fantastic and the service was perfect. Obviously being on the 57th floor, the views are spectacular, particularly the view towards the city skyline. It's a little expensive, but worth every penny. Highly recommende
5
For the past three years that I've been living in Singapore, I never had the chance to go to KU DE TA, so when a good friend of mine came over for a vacation, we decided to go and see the place. I could honestly say that the view was just breathtaking and the skyline was amazing. I could just look at the horizon the whole night and get lost in the city lights. They have friendly and accommodating staff too. The sommelier, Mr. Michael, was uber nice and gave an exceptional service. He would check on us throughout the night to make sure we were having fun. And indeed, we had a blast! There was never a dull moment with him.All in all, we had a wonderful experience in KU DE TA not just because of the spectacular view but most importantly because of their wonderful staff
3
Wonderful views of Singapore and although the food was quite good, our meal was spoiled by the fact that my wife's food arrived twenty minutes before mine! Friendly staff but they need to be taught about service.
4
Went twice once for lunch last trip and loved it. Excellent sushi, sashimi and hot dishes. Spectacular views!! Dinner was so noisy we were yelling across the table and a few drunk Aussies were bumping into everyone. Suggestion go for lunch here and Sky on 57 for dinne
3
We have eaten at this location and the one in Bali and both were very underwhelming. This one has the best views of Singapore for sure. The staff was very nice. The drinks are overpriced and the food is mediocre for the price. Not worth the wait. Go for a drink to see the views, but go elsewhere to eat. With all the great food in Singapore, you can easily do better
4
Not a lover of heights AT ALL, but this restaurant is special. Food was great, service was excellent and despite not being comfortable in towers, etc. the experience overall was well worth any anxieties in the beginning. Great menu and wine list. Spectacular, amazing views. Expensive but worth it. Order the scallops
4
Visited here last weekend with the wife and kids, we visited the Club in the daytime.Pros: Great Views, Tasty Food, no dress code until 530pm, no booking requiredCons: Pricey, Minimum spend of $200 if you want to sit outside under and umbrella (note too hot otherwise with sun / inside is ok, but no views of course
5
It was our very first time to visit Ku De Ta restaurant. We enjoyed our dinner there very much and we had received a good service from Sitrah. She recommended us quite a number of good food, also, surprised us at the end of our dinner. Thank you so much for being so friendly to us
1
FOOD - Pub food would be more enjoyableSTAFF - Lost, didn't know what's going on.STAFF TRAINING - ?????????????VIEW - Zero, you know your up high because you came up a lift. Not even allowed to at least take a few photos on the observation deck. Extra fee for thatDRESS CODE - Don't worry about getting dressed up, just wear your thongs and garden clothsCOST - Biggest tourist rip off I have ever been belted with by far.OTHER CUSTOMERS - Next to us, just shook their heads amazed alsoSUPERVISORS - ??????????????SERVICE - One entree brought to table, then ten minutes later other entree came out and food cold. Main meal 2 dishes 5 minutes apart also coldWrong cards being returned to customers.Bill requested twice and then you get told you have to move because they need the area because its a busy night at the bar and they need the area for standing.Do you still want to go ?Well go and then you can feel as ripped off as I do.In a city of perfection, thought we would leave and think my god how can you go to a city where every single person you have encountered must of been trained by the same person, from Taxi driver to bell boy, from waiter to shop assistant, I mean everyone we encountered.PERFECTION !!!!!!Well just go to Ku De Ta and you will be brought back to earth.I will always look at that magnificent building or structure and as I look at it, a bitter taste will come to my mouth because of Ku De Ta.Don't worry about saying I ate up there, just look at it from street level and enjoy your meal at Cherry Garden or Osteria Mozza or DB's.You will walk away and think, now that's dining and that's Singapore perfection.So many superb restaurants in Singapore, there is no need to experience this one
5
First time at Kudeta to eat despite being in SG for a couple of years now. What can I say - spectacular from start to finish! We had a great table by the window, really well looked after by Akbar. Every course we had was terrific, full of flavour and a testament to top ingredients. Excellent wine and champagne with really good cocktails as well, and when set off against a beautiful Singapore sunset made for a brilliant evening with my wife and our youngest daughter. Not cheap, of course, but I don't mind paying for quality. To those who have given a poor review and said the food was poor / average then would suggest you see a doctor as your taste buds must be on the blink
3
We were looking forward to visiting KuDeTa because we had heard so much about it. Even with a reservation, you are required to stand in a que with others who are going up to the observation deck. When we finally arrived at the restaurant we were seated in a small space with a wall to one side and another table very close on the other. We could bearly hear each other and there was no city view at all. The food was ok but not as imaginative or tasty as we had hoped. The duck breast was a bit dry and the tuna was just like a hundred others I have eaten. Nothing special. The Kai lan side was really good if you like miso. A strange accompaniment to the duck was a deep fried corn on the cob. Not sure how it was intended to be eaten as the cob was hard. The reservation confirmation indicated the table would need to be vacated after 2 hours. I understand why this is important, but it really makes it not at all about the food. Went to the bar after dinner to have a drink (white chocolate martini--S$25) and try to look at the view. It was crowded and we were never really able to see much. It is important to know diners at KuDeTa do not have access to the observation area. Poor decision by MBS in my opinion. With so many great restaurants in Singapore there is no need to visit this one
4
We decided to go to this restaurant on our last night in Singapore to end our holiday.We arrived about 10 minutes before our booking and were asked if we wanted to go to the bar (if you can do it- the view is great- but it can get crowded) - we requested to go straight to the table and they took us there. Once seated- they handed the menus, which they then promptly had to secure itty bitty booklights to as the lighting in the restaurant could almost be described as non existent. The whole point of the meals is to get a whole lot of little plates to share. We ordered duck, lamb, chicken, tempura vegetables, broccolini, rice and edamame for 3 people. This fed us and fed us well. The food was delicious and anything left was simply due to being full. We also ordered 2 glasses of champagne a beer and cocktail. For all of this we didn't get too much change from 380SD.Upon making a reservation we were advised that it would be an 80SD min spend per person. This was easily reached. Not sure what would happen if you didn't make the min spend- you'd probably just get charged anyway. They also advised of a dress code for men (sleeves, no cargos/bermudas). The view can't be beaten and our server was only ever about 6 ft away from us at any time. Not sure if I would go back- there are probably other restaurants just as good- but I can say I've eaten there.

Had an amazing time with friends at the restaurant bar. Excellent cocktails, service and entertainment from the great staff, especially Ben and Vincent! Totally loved this place. Friday night this is the place to be!! R and D loved you guys!!
5
Kudeta is the best location in Singapore and a bar to match!! Extremely friendly and knowledgeable servers ! Very cool place. Thanks a lot Ben and the team.
5
The food was so good! Especially, the lamb was so flavorful and tender, and the desserts were amazing. The music was really good too - the DJ there was awesome. Also it's quite obvious, but the views were exceptional. Highly recommend!
5
Had dinner on the outside patio. The view of the Ocean was wonderful. Be sure to take a walk around to the pool and see the view of the harbor. Serve and food were great!

I was so disappointed with this restaurant, especially when I enquired first before making a reservation for my family. My adult daughter has Coeliac disease and also a vegetarian, which limits the choice of places you can eat when you travel. It is usually only at the more expensive restaurant that the chefs have an understanding of dietary requirements.Before we made the reservation we were told that it would not be a problem as long as the restaurant was given notice and advised in advance. Which is exactly what we did!!Knowing that is was a minimum of $80 per head, so a total of $320 was guaranteed already to this restaurant. It was meant to be a memorable family dinner with a spectacular view, but it turned out to be the most disappointing night of our trip to Singapore. We were told that someone would come to our table to discuss what was available for my daughter and it was in a matter of minutes after looking at the menu that she was advised there was nothing that they could offer her, apart from a bowl of salad. She was told that it is very unusual to request a Gluten Free option as well as being a Vegetarian. Why would it be so difficult for experienced Chefs to make a vegetarian dish that does not contain gluten? Apparantly the kitchen staff do not have the skills to accommodate this request. I find this incredibly absurd. I asked if she could at least have some roast potatoes that were on the menu that were served with a meat dish. We were told that you had to order the meat to get the potatoes. Hard to believe this was the response. Our waitress was cold as they come and did not even try to suggest or help us at all. We should have walked out by this stage but it was late and we had caught a taxi to get there and we all just wanted to eat and get out of there as soon as possible. It was only after I asked if they could at least do wedges from the bar menu. Hooray, there was finally one option, which was going to be difficult to make the minimum $80 spend for her. It was the quickest and most expensive meal we have ever had in under 45 minutes for $320.00. No opologies, no offer of a free drink or desert, nothing! Don't even think about going to this restaurant if you have ANY dietary requirements. Better of buying a ticket just to see the view
4
A great spot to take in the views and the cocktails are good too - though a little pricey. Note that you pay extra to get to the actual bay viewing deck
5
We visited the bar during the day to check on whether we were allowed in as non-residents of the hotel and because we were nosy. They explained that there was a dress code in the evening (smart, long trousers and proper shoes for men) and let us have a look and take some photos of the amazing view and infinity pool. We ended up staying for a cold drink.We just had to return that night, suitably attired, for cocktails. The view was even better now, all lit up. There were still people in the pool and a laser light show taking place on the river below. There was music and a good mixture of people, having drinks and nibbles and squares of the complimentary pizza that they were bringing round. Warm nuts were also brought with the drinks.The cocktails were delicious - vodka, elderflower and lychee - and, given where we were, not outrageously expensive.Great fun and one of our best cocktail moments

At the top of the Marina Bay Sands complex. This restaurant has amazing views. Service quality is very high. Our waitress Lily from China was outstanding - she was intimate with the menu, make great food recommendations and was very entertaining. A credit to the establishment. We had a selection of small plates, all were good and a matching bottle of wine. You will find it hard to find a place to have a better time. You have a choice of indoor and outdoor tables and 360 degree views. Buzzy atmosphere and modern décor.I would strongly recommend this place to anyone

I brought my lovely wife of 16 years for our Anniversary dinner last night. Even though we have been atop the Sky Park previously, the night view was even more stunning than before now that the Gardens and all other surrounding construction have been completed.The fusion menu and sharing concept is refreshingly unique and welcome for us as we always love to share our food. The non-fine dining background music is apt as well.My wife liked the Shishito although it was a tad bitter for my taste. The Soft Shell maki and Prawn Tempura were delicious while the Ranger Tenderloin was done medium rare to perfection. Didn't like the sauces on the steak though, so good thing they weren't necessary. The chili mushrooms were interesting and rich in taste but didn't quite complement the other dishes. We should have perhaps ordered an udon or some fried rice.Service was great as expected. Our server Ken took good care of us by explaining the concept of the menu and brought us some hot water in a unique pot to mix with the room temperature still water as they did not have our requested warm water.Will definitely come back to try other items on the menu and for more of the ambience

4 of us came here late afternoon. It was packed and we have to wait a little bit to get a chair. The snacks and drinks are delicious. I love the Wasabi Chips!! The service was excellent, great atmosphere. Kind of hard to capture memory as we have to share the moment and the view with many other visitors. The music was a lil bit to loud but didn’t bother us. We had a great time , and for sure will be back when we visit Singapore

Went for drinks & snacks with my wife. Amazing view of the city skyline. Drinks & Food quality is really good, though quite expensive. But in the end, its worth the money.

I went for Sunday brunch as a treat after an early-morning 10k race round the bay. I only really expected the views to be good and was prepared for so-so food and uninspired service but was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of both. The only negatives were the rather stained furniture and the unannounced charge for water (S$12 for a small bottle) despite ordering the S$98 brunch with unlimited non-alcoholic drinks. This seemed to be a bit of a petty rip-off in the circumstances
5
Visited this restaurant for dinner. I had heard about the view and the food, but it still left me very very impressed. Being located at the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the restaurant offers fantastic views. The open air restaurant is quite breezy and makes one forget about the warm and humid Singapore atmosphere. The food is fusion - Japanese, South Asian and European. We were 3 of us and ordered 3 starters - Beef tartin, fish in lime sauce and a prawn salad. For main course we had a beef steak, scallops and fish. Desserts included Mango pudding and Goey Chocolate cake .. Everything including the red Pinot Noir was fantastic. It was a little pricey but completely worth it

To eat at Ku De Ta is one of life's dining experiences and has to be done if you are ever in Singapore. The combination of good food and great views makes this a dining experience to remember. The views over the Singapore skyline are impressive from this fifty seventh floor establishment. For the meal we started with a bottle of very delicate and lightly chilled Australian chardonnay to wash down the soft flavours of the snapper and swordfish sashimi, which almost melts in your mouth and followed this with the stronger flavour of the baked sticky topped salmon which was delicious. On the downside the restaurant is dimly lit in an attempt to provide a classy atmospheric look and allow the view to come inside, but I think a little more light would help make reading the menu a little easier (The waiting staff provided torches which was a tad unusual). Also, sometimes you can judge a place by the quality of the decor in the restrooms, but sadly the restrooms were very ordinary and more akin to that of shopping mall restrooms. These two minor negatives aside, all in all a very noteworthy evening ending with a few nightcaps at the outdoor rooftop bar. Oh...the experience is an expensive one, so be prepared
5
Highly recommend this restaurant, the location is reason enough to make the effort! The food was great, service was great, and there is a bar outside where many people were hanging out taking in the sites. It was very lively, a little breezy as it is open air, or was when we were there anyways, the ladies might want to bring a a light cover. I believe it turns into a club later on, or maybe the club is separate... we were with the kids so didn't stay out. ENJOY

Kudeta skybar is one of the best place to go with your friends or family specially if you have something special to celebrate.yesterday we went to there with my family and asked bartender sandeep if he can make some mocktails for us because menu i was given there didn't find any mocktail so he recommended for us to try his own created mocktails. And i Will thank him for such a delicious drink what we had

Firsl, let me comment that the location on the top of tower 3 of the famous Marina Bay sands hotel is supeband naturally one has to pay for such exclusivity .The table we were given was also superb overlooking the botanic gardens and bay , the menu was presented as was then drinks menu . Our hostess who had escorted is to the table said there was a lunchtime special menu that we should try , however this was not presented with the menus and upon requesting it in wastold by our waiter Jess that it the food was no good and that we stick to the Al a carte.We ordered a bottle of NZ SAV Blanc at $133 SG was fairly expensive although of course we were paying for both locations and ambience , however in the 30c + heat having to request an ice bucket of both the waters nod wine was unaceptableat this level of establishment. Taking ouwaters advice we ordered. Chicken terriaki which was ok but not exceptional My main grouse was the overbeaingly loud 'Mood' music that apparently could not be turned down as the volumes as fixed It was so intrusive it actually detracted from the meal and experience.Overall I would rate the the food as 6 , the ambience because of the intrusive Muzak as 2 and the attitude of the staff as 2Worth a visit for the view , don't bother eating there unless you like loud intrusive music and don't wish to speak with your partnerExpect high drinks and meal prices - which are understandable.  Not sure I if I want an honest waiter telling me the lunch menu is NO. GOOD. Thoug

Ninthy made us feel at home right away, came with recomandation for different drinks, we were very happy with his choices. He also told us about what we could see of Singapore. Thank you Ninthy for a great visit. We will be back, and recomend it to friends

If you are into the panoramic scenery, best to go into the sky parc instead, but you are close to the edge. This restaurant is about foood with a view!The food was better than the last time we were there. We were a party of 6 this time and a delicate menu was provided with an excellent accompanying wine list.Make no mistake that the menu is delightful. A heavily influenced Japanese selection but quite simply for me the snapper sashimi was the best of the selection on taste. visually all superb and i would be bankrupt if we took the kids there and the feasted in quantity on light bitesWe worked the menu like a tapas, 4 from the front, 2 from the middle and 1 each of the mains...As always here is a downside. No improvement with the cosy lighting and the hard to read menus. iPhone light works very well See you again soon. Its a must for those looking at a restaurant with a view, but don't just go for the view as there are better place

Our expectations were high for this restaurant. We saw the pictures on their web site showing fabulous views of Singapore, these were fabricated. The restaurant is NOT up to the edge of the Marina Bay Sands, it is surrounded by thick bushes so the only view you get is if you are lucky enough to get the few tables looking over the back of Marina Bay. Apart from a few "normal" tables & chairs the seating for our meal was appalling. Very low settee like seating & you can't put your feet under the table, I had to take my shoes off to do so! The bar is open to anyone (but expensive) so you get a continuous throng of people going right through the middle of the restaurant outside. We had a jug of Sangria which cost $48 (Â£24) about 1.5 glasses each. The food was uninspiring & well over-priced. We wouldn't have minded paying if the view was spectacular. It is much better for you to pay $25 to visit the Sky Deck, outside of the restaurant than paying $250 for a meal. I don't recommend it

Great view, service cocktails and atmosphere
Overall enjoyable good atmosphere and friendly Staff
Will return

Good restaurant, about as expensive as you would expect, still affordable. The view is good but we were expecting more. Impossible to view the pool.
4
just spent a very short time here for 1 drink. they offer a very nice view from the MBS! music is good, drink is okay but the vibe is all about. would like to come back and experience more.

A friend who travels to Singapore said this restaurant was a must. He was right! The view at night is spectacular! The dining room is comfortable with table spread apart. The greeter in the lobby was courteous and directed us to the correct elevator that took us up to the top of the hotel. We were quickly seated. Took awhile to get our order taken but once placed the server was efficient and polite. The menu is limited but has a nice selection. My friends and I thought the pricing was fine because the portion sizes left nobody hungry. And we thought the dishes were well prepared and presented. Just walking from Tower 3 to Tower 1 is an experience. We are used to large extravagant hotel but this one is over the to........tastefully done and not garish like Vegas hotel. We would recommend giving it a try
5
We had researched and considered eating here before we embarked on this trip. The deal was sealed when we discovered that the Sands wants something like $26?? per person to go up to the viewing platform on the 57th floor. If you make reservations at Ku De Ta early in the day, they let you go up to the restaurant (bar) which is also on the 57th floor for free for a drink and to check the place out! The view is nearly the same as from the viewing deck plus you can have a cocktail. Be forewarned and pay heed however to the four ($$$$) rating as this place is pricey. They also have an $80 minimum expenditure per person for dinner. (This is atop the worlds 2nd most expensive building, with a killer view in one of the worlds most expensive cities after all.)After going up in the afternoon for a drink, photo's and viewing we returned for dinner at 6:30. The food was just outstanding in quality and presentation. Our waiter was top-notch and fairly attentive. I say "fairly" because we feel the standards of service in the part of the world are a bit different than what you might be used to in the US and some other western countries. It is common to have to flag down a waiter for anything from more water to wanting to pay your bill in every restaurant we ate at throughout Malaysia, Singapore, Viet Nam and China. So that being said we were very pleased with our service with one minor nit: It actually went TOO fast. We are no strangers to a fine dining experience in a top restaurant, which usually takes AT LEAST an hour. At Ku De Ta from the moment we sat down to the time we were done paying was just under an hour. Meet your waiter, look over the extensive menu, order, get an appetizer placed in front of you in like 10 minutes! We would like to have spread the experience out a bit longer and have to say this has never been something we have complained about anywhere else. Overall fantastic and we would certainly go back
5
After research I booked a table at the Ku De Ta for me and my Fiancée. It was the best of choices. People write about the view, and wow what a view. The night time view from 57 storeys is stunning, you can see all over the City.What we did find, which was not highlighted much in other reviews was that the food and service are top notch. I particularly want to make special mention to our hostess Ara, she was everything you would expect from a hostess, she was more than a waitress. Ara was discreet, helpful, aware, pleasant, efficient and graceful. I can't say enough of the service and the effortless way she made this a special night for us.A DJ put on some soulful sounds in the restaurant around 10pm and later we went to the rooftop disco just a across the restaurant foyer.I can't think of a better dining experience
5
Ku De Ta on top of Marina Bay Sands is the best place to enjoy a Singapore Sling. The view is breathtaking over stunning Singapore. The bar has a wide range of drinks/cocktails and the service is perfect. The bar tenders are all very friendly and know how to mix the best cocktails. Especially Ben was very cheerful and had a great enjoyment of work. And he mixed one of the best drinks I've ever had (something with Rum and honey, don't remember the name) :

We wanted to see this restaurant as we were told by family it had great views of the city.Disappointed as the bar outside was packed so view was limited and also the atmosphere in the restaurant seemed rowdy-not the image I had in mind.For the price I paid I expected at least there to be a restriction on how many people can be in the bar at any one time. Also I expected the restaurant atmosphere to be more civilised and less like a lads night out.We were told by email that the dress had to be stylish chic (so no shorts, sleeveless shirts etc). Anticipating this we made a real effort to dress nice. When we turned up it seemed that all other guests turned up in casual clothes or straight off the beach! No point having a dress code if its not going to be held up.One off visit is fine. Wouldn't come back and probably recommend just the skydeck view only. Restaurant overpriced and not classy at all
5
We are from Australia and each time my family and i go to Singapore we always go to this bar/restaurant for a few drinks. The view is incredible, the atmosphere is fun and relaxed and the manager- Benedict is so lovely! He always remembers us and goes out of his way to make sure you enjoy your time. He can give you lots of honest and local advice which is really handy when you are a tourist. I would highly recommend this bar and make sure you say hi to Benedict! Hands down one of the most accomodating and friendly managers i have ever met
5
Be prepared to spend a lot of money and think it worth every dollar. Ku De Ta is a exclusive club. One of the best views in Singapore. Only the finest drinks. If you go as a couple it will be unforgetable. If you go single... well... you may not go home alone..
5
We went up here for birthday drinks and to enjoy the and was not disappointed. Definitely worth the trip up. will try the restaurant next time.
5
On the 57th floor you will find an incredible bar. The view is breath taking and the service is fantastic. Drinks are a little bit pricey but 100% worth it. Special mention to the bartender Benedict for making the best south side I've ever had.
4
I went with my family. My brother, sister and my sister's children. This is my second visit. Alison was our waitress she was very nice and introduce dishes as I was not too sure about. We ordered the a few entree and two mains. The duck breast was very good. I don't recommend the fried rice as it does not have much flavour. Overall service was very good and the scent there is perfect
4
We've been at the Bar at Ku DÃ© Ta and it was totally amazing. Great drinks, great view, great barkeepers. Everyone can see, that they really love their jobs. Especially Ben. Welcomed us very warmly, always friendly, very charming, always smiling and having fun. PLUS mixing the best cocktails and giving the best recommendations. Just go there and find out yourself, it's worth it
5
This restaurant is unique and located at Skypark on top of Marina Bay Sands, Singapore.The restaurant is independently run and serves absolutely fine and top quality Asian fusion food. Had a mix of sushi and Chinese dishes and every item was delicious. It is a little pricey but one can expect that we're sure the rents are as high as the building itself!!Regarding the location it has an unique position. It is the only restaurant on that side of the Skypark and has a beautiful open section which runs out onto the Skypark deck and is somewhat elevated giving an amazing view of the gardens, the Singapore flyer and on the other side all the way over the CBD of Singapore.Highly recommended
5
Went here for dinner and it was everyone's highlight of the trip. The view at night is truly spectacular. Vistas of the city, marina, and gardens by the bay at night should not be missed. The food was delicious if not quite up to the views. Service was excellent, but quite expensive. This is a splurge romantic night that we will not forget

This restaurant is a must if you are in Singapore. The Restaurant is on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and provides a spectacular view over both the city of Singapore and the harbour. Warning. It is not cheap. However, it is not the most expensive and the food is delicious. We went on Monday the 12th March 2015 for an evening meal and it was fabulous. I had oysters to start with Black Cod as the main meal. The cod was really spectacular. There was no fishy taste, the sauce matched the fish perfectly and the flesh just melted on the tongue. My wife had Filet Mignon which was cooked perfectly and very tender to match. All this was provided by a very efficient waitress called Jess and Manager Fabio who gave us a lot of advice on the food and an excellent service. We liked the food so much we went back again on the Thursday when I had their Rib Eye Steak which again was moist, tender, with a very tasty sauce and, for me, one of the most perfect meals I have had for a long time. There is a good selection of items on the menu to cater for many tastes, together with some very good wines ( Pinot Grigio at a reasonable price or a nice Merlot for the red meat course). Going back twice in one week appears to be a bit unusual for this restaurant (although another couple were on their second visit at the same time as us) but we felt it was worth it. Be aware, they are due to undergo some refurbishment in May 2015 so there may be some disruption during this period, although the Manager said this would be kept to a minimum as much as possible. Enjoy your meal

There are many reason to visit Ku De Ta. One of them is definitely the view that the space offers of Singapore, its a 360 view like no other. The cocktails in the space are just amazing. The food is a nice mix of Asian flavour which are clean and subtle. Other than the food, its one of the best bars to visit in Singapore
3
So what you will be paying for here is the view. Nice atmosphere, I liked the music, but the food was not anything super exciting that you couldn't get somewhere else in half the price. And you don't get to see the view unless you are a table right at the edge. Next time, I'm just going for drinks and see what that is like..
4
This spot is great for a drink, lunch or dinner. Not inexpensive but you get a wonderful view of Singapore - no need to pay to go to the top of the Sands nor take the ferris wheel - views here are great.The dinks were very good; nice wine selection. The tasting menu seemed interesting but we opted for individual entrees. Portions are good size but not overwhelming. I had the pork belly which was very good.An almost must try for a novice visit to Singapore. Enter through building 1
3
The food was good but not excellent. Service was very good. Coming from Finland I am used to expensive food but this one was too much if compared to food quality. Drinks are even more expensive, but that's normal in Singapore.
4
Excellent service as everywhere in Singapore but you go here for the view. It's utterly amazing during the day and I can only imagine what it will be like at night time.
3
This is my 3rd or 4th time here for dinner. And I must say, the view remains the same, and the food and drink value keeps getting worseWe ordered a range of dishes to share. Portions are small and some of the dishes were not good. The Iberia pork cheeks taste like bad beef. The lobster tempura didn't seem to have lobster in it. And oh gosh, the cost of the drinks, $40 for a shot whiskey and all that jazzNot sure if I'll return
1
After being able to get a table (although only for an hour) we were looking forward to nice meal with a beautiful sight.We had a table outside. But what a disappointmentThe service was horrible, after eating the more than bland starter the waiter put our used cutlery back on the bare table for the main course. Another waiter brought us a new set of cutlery after my inquiry. The Austrian White vine (which we found surprisingly on the wine card) was too warm and the food was simply boring and completely tasteless.There were a couple of “managers” in suits and headphones importantly swaning around but nobody seemed to be interested if the customers were satisfied or orderly serviced.The price of the meal was compared what we got not even worth the sight over the city.Our advise: go up there into the bar, have a drink and enjoy the view over the City but don`t eat there!
4
I've given this restaurant 4 out of 5, but it should really be 5 out of 5 for the views - which were truly amazing - and then 3-3.5 for the food/service/restaurant itself. Although we did enjoy our dinner here, it was nothing spectacular, unlike the price; you're obviously paying for the views. You only get an alloted time in the restaurant too, so we were kicked out as soon as we'd finished our meal. It was a shame also that they don't have any way of securing tables for the restaurants' patrons in the bar area. We paid an awful lot of money for a meal and then had to fend-for-ourselves in the bar area, which was a mixture of restauarant patrons and those that had paid simply to come and see the views
4
The reservation and email contact went well, with exceptional short answering times. They even kept track of pending questions and answered whenever the answer was ready. We were lucky enough to get seats with good view to the city.The cocktails instead may need some rework. All of them seem missing something. It was disappointing for all my guests - not just a singular opinion! The Mango-Daquiri ala Kudeta for example had a taste of Mango fruit sirup with no alcohol at all
4
Nice to go up here for a drink. Go into the foyer at the Marina Bay Sands and ask for the lift to Ku De Ta. You can go straight up to the bar/restaurant and not pay the $20 to go to the viewing platform.You can spend that on a drink and usually when you walk out you can see the viewing platform anyway. Drinks are Singapore prices but worth it
3
I am unhappy to report that I was disappointed by my recent trip to KU DE TA restaurant at the Marina Bay Sands hotel.Service was good and friendly but I just don't think that the meal represented good value for money.I just can't recommend it
5
What a view. Sipping a cocktail with the cashews and the lovely view,nothing can beat this. I still dont understand why people buy a 23 SGD ticket for observatory when u get literally same views from here. 23 SGD will get u a decent drink here
4
We came upon KU DE TA because we were staying at Marina Bay Sands. The atmosphere there was really good. The spectacular night scenery of Singapore, the cocktail and the music all made our night perfect. We were served by bartender Sly. He's really friendly and he made great cocktail. Really had a wonderful night.
5
The best views in Singapore along with very well made cocktails. Expect to pay high prices but well worth it.
4
The views are to die for, this place is definitely the best location in Singapore to watch the sunset. The food was excellent as was the service. The dinner was served family style for sharing, which allowed a greater opportunity to sample the menu.
5
When they have a view, sometimes they don't try but not here. Food and service was awesome. Lovely last night in Singapore.
5
Ku de ta my bestest experience ever. The ambiance is very appealing but to top it all the friendly staff and their service was amazing . Inspite of them being busy they catered to evry individual need of my friends . Particularly this friendly gentleman benedict,sugested noffered us number of exotic cocktails which was an icing on the cake to our night. Would not think twice .soothing music .grt weather Id visit soon again.thank 
4
It is nice to have a drink on the 57th floor (175m high). Cocktails are for 24 bucks, beer 16-20. If you go to the bar there is no extra fee, but if you want to go to the terrace for better view, there is extra entrance. During the day you can go in shorts and T-shirts, but in the evening formal dress is required
3
Brought a good friend here based on my visit last year. We had a completely different experience. We sat in the middle of the restaurant, but outside so there was hardly the view. There was a beautiful breeze and it was a fun atmosphere. The food was not good. My fish was overdone and the edamame were over seasoned. I had the mizuna salad and that was fine. Singapore has such good food - it isn't worth the trip. We ended up leaving early, going downstairs and getting dessert somewhere else. Might be worth the food quality if you get a good view, but if you don't it isn't a good experience
1
We made specific reservation requests for the night that were not met. Waited 40 minutes just to get a drink, the food is mediocre at best and way over valued, left hungry. Staff were slow. The bar area detracts from the overall experience as it is quite crowded and cramps the eating area. Singapore has much better restaurants. Our party was extremely disappointed after spending over $500. They even charge you for a glass of water for your meal. A real tourist trap and con job
5
Was only able to stay at the bar for a short during my stopover in Singapore, but i must say i was very impressed! View was amazing and the service was no different. But what left a lasting impression was the drinks. Was served at the bar by a phenomenal bartender named Nithi, whose knowledge of cocktails and attention to detail was nothing like i have seen. He had wonderful recommendations, including a dark rum called Diplomatico, which is now a new favourite! Definitely worth the trip
1
What an expensive disappointment this was! High atop the Marina Bay Sands Hotel on the roof our party was seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant. The view to one side was blocked by the bar and bar patrons. The view to the other was blocked by the building. The view to the remaining two sides was blocked because we were too far from the edge to see anything but sky. It was chilly and very windy.After too long a wait we were able to order. The food arrived after another long wait. (Total time was over 2 hours.) The portions were small and the taste was only slightly better than the Maxwell Village hawker food. (After the meal we went to the observation deck entrance but were told that we’d have to go downstairs and pay a fee. This after spending nearly $400 on 3 meals—there is an $80 per person minimum.
5
if you r lucky you will find the right seat with a great view. Bottle of wine is as cheap as at sea level. The team takes excellent warm care and the atmosphere adds to the celebration. Went in for my birthday n was well hosted well
3
Went for drinks....very crowded, no seats. Very windy. Not allowed for drinks in indoor bar unless the price fixed $80pp dinner is ordered. Nice View but, that's it. Bar service inattentive probably because it's an overrun tourist spot.
4
This is amazing happening place on Marina Bay rooftop. Its a bar and lounge as well as you get good food there. The DJ and music was awesome. The crowd is really happening from all nationalities.
4
Food is too good but very costly. It is too noisy. If you want to go & relax, it is big no. It is prestigious place to go. Overall for an experience, it is must go.
5
On the 57 floor of the Marina Bay Sands, Tower 3; the view is amazing over Singapore.The food was fresh, and flavoursome to say the least, and desert was to die for; presentation was spectacular. The wine was very nice - a little expensive. The Guest Service Executive - Leo Lopez made us feel like the most important people in the restaurant. Staff were presented very well and very professionally;and also well trained in fine dining. 3.5 hours of absolute pleasure. What a great memory. Recommend to all and a memory to keep forever

so after 8 days in Singapore this was the worse treatment I received as a person who suffers from limited mobility (clearly visibly disabled). My brother who lives here took me and his family for a drink as a treat and because he thought it would be better to see the views from the restaurant (where he thought we could sit) rather than the skypark. Not the cheaper option as drinks were very expensive. After a few minutes I needed to sit. Initially there was very little response to our request for a seat (all seats are reserved for dinners at $80per head!)then another guest on crutches got up from a seat and my brother "dared" to move it to a better position so I could see (the whole point of going there)After a couple of minutes the service manager came up to me and told me I had to move as I shouldn't be in a chair anyway, and as I was disabled I could have a seat but away from the view! Apparently I would be in the way and it wasn't fair on other guests.Anyone who has been up there will know if you are sat away from the edge you can't actually see anything. My brother was annoyed to say the least and I can only imagine the bad press that type of comment would get in the UK (it would go viral on facebook!!)the place is not disabled friendly, I'm not even sure how someone in a wheelchair would get to the restaurant and bar as there are steps and I didn't see a lift. I am extremely disappointed with this restaurants attitude - I am disabled following a major illness and this holiday was part of my recuperation. They spoilt my evening :( we went elsewhere to eat after our drink
5
We started off with an indoor table with no view, but asked for a better table and the manager Fabio whisked us off to a beautiful, private outdoor table with a view of the harbour. We could even see Malaysia and Indonesia from our table! From there our Waiter Aly kept us laughing with stories and provided excellent recommendations. We had spicy tuna rolls, a prawn salad, grilled scallops and rib eye. Aly even brought us an extra dessert! The prices add up, it's what you expect for a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and the fantastic service really made for a memorable night
5
I went here with my girlfriend on our last night in Singapore. The entire experience blew me away. I want to thank both Fabio and Ali for looking after us. They were both amazing. Fabio made sure that we had a nice table with a view. Ali was our waiter and looked after us all night, such a great guy, he really enhanced our dining experience.The food here is top notch, a little pricey but you get what you pay for. Great chefs/kitchen. Drinks are good as well. I had 3 of their signature old fashioneds and they were mixed quite well.I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have some amazing food and soak in skyline views while doing it
5
The restaurant is on the 57th floor terrace of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The city view is good, but you must ask for a table with a good view. The staff was very willing to oblige. They stopped by after our appetizers were served and asked if we were still willing to move as they had located a great table for us. I saw them do this for at least 2 other customers and it speaks a lot about how far they are willing to go to please customer requests. The seafood menu items are great and the sauces with each dish is exquisite. If you are visiting Shanghai, book at this restaurant for an experience.
5
we had dinner with our family from overseas and had Azlin attending to us at our table. She was amazing and gave us fantastic food recommendation. She was super attentive, made our guest feel good and truly gave us service with a smile. If only the front desk staff at restaurent observe this fantastic lady serving us they will learn a thing or two about customer service. The food was ok, the soft shell crab roll was very poorly packed and disintegrating, not what you expect at a fancy place like that. Overall the food was ok Azlin made some great reco. Give her a raise or promotion or both she did a terrific jo

When you plan your trip to Singapore you can't help but notice the "Boat Building" perched on the edge of the inner harbor with it's amazing profile. I knew we needed to go to the top to check out the view, but did not anticipate I would have my best meal in Singapore up in the sky! From their shark skin salad, to the to their broccolini everything on the menu was delightful, flavorful and light. The staff was wonderful & I had the most amazing Mai Tai of my life. Their top ranked chefs, sommeliers, and mixologists do ther very best to give you a top notch experience. I will recommend it to all my friends

I went for drinks and the ambience was really nice, good music with a live DJ. The view was excellent.

My boyfriend made reservation in dec 2014 for our anniversary/valentine's day on 14 feb 2015. We were asked to chill at the outdoor rooftop bar while waiting for our seats. However, our seats were still not ready and we were given seats at one isolated corner with no view at all. Most importantly, we saw the outdoor seats were not fully occupied at all. We asked the staffs if we could change to outdoor seats instead and they said it's fully occupied and not sure how long was the waiting time, so we decided to order our food first. After we ordered the Valentine's day set, the staffs told us that we could change to outdoor seats. In my opinion, they were looking down at us for not able to afford to dine here and after we ordered the set, they became more polite etc. Fyi, our bill was S$400

Second time to dine here and just like the 1st one, the experience is awesome, Special thanks again to Jen for the very smooth and easy reservation, food recommendation and making sure that we were being taken care of. This is the best place in SG may it be for business or personal, will surely make a trip here everytime I'm in SG

It's a a no brainer: either pay for the Skypark but don't then decide you want a cocktail, or go straight to Kudeta, but you won't be allowed into the Skypark without paying...so recently I plumped for the Kudeta option: more expensive as the food and drink cost more than the Skypark fee but better value than paying and then upgrading to Kudeta if you want to eat and drink! And I have seen the view a fair number of times! The food is a delight and not too bad if you choose small size portions and not the main courses: delicious tempura vegetables, tasty tuna sushi, mixed sashimi salad, grilled prawns with spinach salad and sticky squid. But caveat emptor - the view is not so good from Kudeta, so if its the view you are after, stick to the Skypark option..

I was only in Singapore for a couple of days and thought of going somewhere special. I've read a lot of reviews about this place and decided to go here on a Saturday night with my best friends. The moment we entered the roof top, we were captivated by an amazing view of Singapore! The city looked spectacular from where we were standing. The lights were shining everywhere, music was fantastic and the people were all in high spirits, having a great time with friends. My friends and I really had an amazing experience and not to mention, rounds of fantastic drinks! I would have to commend their Sommelier, Michael, for being very friendly and for recommending a great champagne to cap off the night! We will definitely go here again on our next SG visit

I've been to ku de ta restaurant in the beginning of February and have to say that this was one of my best dinner I had. My family was visiting Singapore and my mother and father had wedding anniversary - I did a simple reservation and we were treated like kings! The service is really good - bar, floor staff and sommeliers really pay attention, are focused and fast! The food was so awesome! Thanks to Chef Michael who actually come out to say hello! We had 2 bottles of great Austrian wine recommended by Chief Sommelier Michael - the sommelier explained the wine to us so perfectly that we had to take another one - what a great recommendation from Mr Leitner! Thanks to the chef for the anniversary dessert!We will visit next year again when my parents are back! In the meantime I don't mind to bring my friends there to enjoy awesome wine!Thanks to the whole team! Excellent

The service was great and very polite. The food was delicious and nicely arranged. Unfortunately is was very cold and dark in the restaurant. Usually we do not go to restaurants where you are told to leave your table after two hours but because of the expected view we tried it. It seams that the restaurant does not belong to the Hotel so you need to pay extra to go to the observation desk. What a disappointment after we spent more than 200$(!) for a dinner for two! They really should rethink there policy. CN Tower in Toronto or Rockefeller in NY, as an example, handled this much better
5
We went to KU DE TA at our last Singapore trip. Actually just for the great view, but I ended up being very surprised about the great food and even better service.We seriously enjoyed the evening and night. Because of the fantastic atmosphere and service, it got a bit later this evening as actually planned. A special thanks to the Sommelier Michael, who gave us the best wine recommendations ever. But not only that. With his friendly and funny way to serve he actually made our evening!We will be back soon

Went here with my family visiting Singapore over Chinese New Year. The food was very good standard, ambiance was very cosmopolitan and the service was good (which is sometimes hard to comeby in Singapore). It was my first time and i would certainly go back. Oh and do try the great cocktails!
4
It was a great dinning at Ku De Ta. We love the line snappers and have ordered 2 plates. The blue fin was fresh and delicious too. Great view and excellent experience. Ken was our waiter that night. He has suggested few nice dishes for us to try. Very good suggestion. Thanks Ken! We definitely will go back again and recommend to our friends
5
Had two fantastic meals and loved everything about it. A big thanks to the lovely PJ for making us feel so welcome, you made the experience extra special.
5
Amazing place to relax and enjoy. Went there at late afternoon with my GF. We had dinner.Nice food and nice service. The Sommelier is from Austria, very professional. He introduce us to Austrian wine. Our best day in Singapore. Thanks Ku De Ta.

Service was friendly and the inside atmosphere was nice, but the lamb rack came out cold and the steak was tough... in short: the food was definitely not worth the $250 we spent on it. After a disappointing dinner we had drinks outside at the rooftop bar. Unlike the restaurant, I would for sure recommend the bar! The views, the music, the lighting... awesome

I had Valentine's Day brunch this year and it was delicious with excellent portions and well-prepared presentation however the food lacked the right amount of spice or salts. Some of the exotic options were a tad bland. The pork belly appetizer was delicious and the steak tartare wS perfect. Unfortunately the main course was bland and lacked flavor.Overall the price was over-the-top at $98 for brunch and $178 for brunch with cocktails. The cocktails were delicious but at $24 each they were tiny and arrived a bit late. For a beautiful place with a magnificent view I expected the menu to match the ambience of the location and the view unfortunately it didn't. My advice is take the elevators up to the 57th floor order a cocktail outside and enjoy the gorgeous feel with great conversation and a few selfies
5
We had a wonderful lunch at 2 February 2015. Tasty Sushi, a wonderful duck-breast and delicious sweets. On of our most favourite places to spend a lunch. Special thanks to Sithra, wonderful service, we estimated much.Wine was very tasty too, prices ok for that kind of location.We will see you again

Have brought a visitor from mine over and thought I just want to show him a great view over the city with one of the finest places in town, but have been seriously let down by this place. We have arrived and have been searching for the right floor and elevator quite a long time cause neither the hotel staff as well as the kudeta staff could actually tell us where and which floor we should go to. after arriving upstairs, we have been "strongly advised" by the security to not go to the pool area as we are not allowed (in a very unpleasant way) and have been forced to stand at the bar. OKAY.After we have ordered our first drinks we were placed the bill, but we have informed the bartender several times that we would like to run a tab, or just continue our bill, which he has just refused. So we wanted to pay our bill and wanted to leave immediately after the drinks, which was not possible because closing the bill took them 15 freaking minutes. and after asking how it can take 15 minutes the bar manager has explained that they are closing the cashier!!! sorry to say, but thats none of my concern.Thank you, but no thank you KUDETAand by the way, even though the drinks are fancy expensive, they can't even afford a glass washer to clean their glasses outside.. Everything is only washed by hand, very hygienic!!
5
It doesn't get a lot better than this. We had a super Japanese themed meal and a pitcher of Sangria with a view to die for. The service was superb and the bill not too high considering the quality of the experience. For something out of the ordinary it's a. Must
2
We had a half 8 dinner reservation but weren't seated until 9:15pm, which is usually ok but when you're instructed to go have a drink at the bar, I have an expectation of being able to have a seat whilst I wait. That was far to much to ask, instead they had us standing around looking like fools over someone else's meal. The cocktails were extremely overpriced as were the beers, and the bar tenders were obnoxious to no end. The service staff were absolutely appalling and not welcoming or accommodating in the least. The ONLY redeeming feature was the food, and I say this very lightly. The portion sizes were ok and the meal itself had wonderful flavour, but trying to get past the rest of what was a disappointing evening brought my meal satisfaction down. I won't recommend this place, nor will I ever return. It's an overpriced establishment full of pretentious human beings, and the view wasn't what I'd call amazing. Extremely disappointed!
5
The food was delicious, especially the Beef Sirloin Tataki. It's expensive ($90USD) but worth the price. They had unique & Delicious cocktails as well. I never felt rushed and they service was outstanding! At one point I was taking in the view of the Restaurant (as I had primarily had my back to it the entire evening as I was enjoying the view of the city). And immediately the Manager Leo approached me asking if what he could assist with. My server Azlin was very knowledgeable about the menu and extremely personable. I travel extensively around the world and often dine alone due to my career. This meal & experience will go down as one of the best so far. Thank you Ku De Ta

Limited menu,overpriced , and due to the tourist traffic on the deck it's like dining in a fish bow

Superb location .. best at evening !
Amazing view with lovely food and good crowd ( best to be on week days than weekend )..!!

Had a delicious cocktail Singapore sling with spectacular view of Singapore, Reasonable price, great experience.

We stumbled across Ku De Ta at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel by accident while looking for the best way to enjoy the skypark. There are two parts to the restaurant - a more formal dining area and then tucked around the corner on route to the swimming pool was the more informal lounge dining area. This provided excellent views, comfortable seating and food that was tasty and good value. We arrived in time for lunch and found the portions sizes to be ample. The staff were mixed, the initial waiter was very enthusiastic and friendly while his colleague was less so. We found our visit to be relaxing, enhanced by the fact we were not pressured to vacate our seats. It was a shame that the coffee machine had broken down... Note that if you visit in the evenings there is a smart casual dress code. Don't forget your camera as you'll want to record the panoramic views over Marina Bay

Singapore certainly has top spots, and lots of them .... this unfortunately is not one of them! The only 'top' part about it is the spectacular view. The food, compared to other places close by is hardly worth mentioning. All I can really say about it is "overpriced for what you actually get."That said, it is a "Must Visit" for an evening cocktail at the bar. The drinks are good, not cheap but not overly priced, and the view alone is worth the visit
5
My Fiancee surprised me recently with a trip to Singapore .We visited many gorgeous Restaurants and bars ,But the trip to ku de ta was definately my favourite .The Restaurant is gorgeous ,views are amazing.We had a table outside ,its all open under lots of umbrellas, we shared lots of small plates,gorgeous sushi ,beef tataki ,salmon ,the list goes on.Service was wonderful ,super friendly and efficient ,Cocktails amazing..Go here for an amazing total experience....

Sacrebleu! Great place to be for a drink or to eat with a fantastic view of Singapore!KU DE TA offers a bar and a restaurant both located on top of the MBS building. Drinks and food are a bit on the high side in regards to the quality served but compensated easily by the great view of Singapore and the surrounding dancing atmosphere. If you pass by Singapore, don't miss a visit to KU DE TA

Visited here in January 2015 after seeing the spectacular hotel from the taxi on the way from the airport to our hotel. Had a meal at this modern Asian restaurant but if you are not able to eat shell fish you will struggle to select a dish off the menu. We tried lots off the menu and really enjoyed each one; very different to any modern Asian restaurant I had been to in London. The staff were pleased to offer assistance with your choice and make modifications to suit. The tables are situated quite close together so offer little privacy but it does mean you can start talking to others who are invariably from the far corners of the world. The views are amazing overlooking the infinity pool on the 47th floor and offer breathtaking views across the city. The outside bar offers the best vantage point. There is also a sky park on the 46th Floor which again is well worth the visit. Book ahead as the restaurant gets very busy. They offer dining in two hour slots but when we were there for over three hours they did not move us on, perhaps due to the very very expensive wine we had ordered. After your meal take the lift to the ground floor and try out the casino; be sure to take your passport as without it you will not get in! You could also try out the nightclub to burn off the calories just consumed. Would definitely visit this restaurant and stay at the hotel again
4
The views over Singapore were outsanding, and a must see, but I suggest you just visit for a cocktail. The restaurant is extremely pricey and all the dishes are served together as prepared starters together with main course. If you ordered a hot main course by the time you finished your starter it was tepid. Out of the 8 of us that visited only 4 people enjoyed the meal the others were disappointed. My Chicken was served with hairs on Yuk. I would visit again but only for the rooftop bar which was spectacular and worth a visit alone for.The staff were helpful but got 2 of the dishes wrong by doubling up on them and seemed vague when told and never apologised
3
This place is worth visiting because of the great view. But on Tuesday night there were no locals at all there, only visitors looking around. I was to attend a private party there but the staff at the bar desk couldn't help to find it - even it was 15 meters away from the bar..

My husband and I booked dinner here for our 10th wedding anniversary. On arrival we were given our choice of seating outside or inside. After a couple of minutes sitting outside we realised it was going to be a windy night and staff had absolutley no problem moving us to an inside table.Our waiter explained that the menu was designed for sharing, took our drinks order brought us some water and left us to peruse the menu.We shared 5 dishes and it was explained that they would be brought out in an order determined by the kitchen.Wow - the food was amazing. I think of myself as a bit of a hard to please diner and was blown away by the presentation and amazing flavours.We had Octopus sashimi, crispy sticky squid (this is a must order item!), Fried prawn salad (another must order), seared scallops (okay, must order this too!) and Duroc Pork. The Pork was the only one that didn't wow us as it didn't come with crispy skin but it was still delicious.The timing of the food was perfect, plates cleared and clean ones brought out between hot and cold dishes, Cockails were yummy, and staff were very attentive but not in our face.The final delight was when the manager surprised us with a complimentary desert with "Happy 10th Anniversary" written in chocolate on the plate. It was the Mango-passion and Fromage Blanc. Again, must order!They really made us feel so special and we had a fabulous evening.Huge thank you to Keith, Azlin and Fabio - we will definitly be back next time we are in Singapore

Great experience to eat and drink at the top of this wonderful hotel in Singapore. Great choice of food,and drinks. Maybe a little expensive for your average visitor but me and my partner had a wonderful night.
5
great food, night view and services
And a very nice Mandarin speaker waitress, Jess, provided excellent introduction of the cuisines.
5
It was amazing!!! I love the food, services and ambiance. You can't imagine till you experience by yourself. Can't wait to go back there. Superb!!!!
3
This restaurant had great views of the city skyline and pool areas but the service was slow and you had to ask for service. The food was expensive for what was provided and quite simply, underwhelming. Not impressed by the food whatsoever. I'd recommend having a drink here only for the views and thenmove on to somewhere more focussed on providing service and quality food. Very disappointing indeed
1
We had 2 cocktails, and a sangria for 2 to share. Not one of the 4 of us enjoyed our drinks very watery naff cocktails, with minimal alcohol. The sangria was horrendous. Definitely not worth the 115 dollars, quite possibly the worst drinks I have ever had. Perhaps going for bottled beer would be the best option. Asked for food/ snacks but we're told we needed to have made a reservation, oh well there loss
5
My wife and I dined here on a Friday night in January 2015. The service was exceptional, we had about 6 courses, the pork belly lollipops and lobster tempura were by far the stand out dishes and I highly recommend them. The extensive wine list is also impressive. We dine out frequently in Sydney and have frequented many of the top restaurants in Asia; combined with the views and location, I rank Ku De Ta Singapore as one of my favourite restaurants in Asia
5
I needed a pick me up on a Tuesday and opted for an indulgent lunch with my bestie (yes locals choose Ku De Ta too!). We wanted the full monty, something with a view, an ambience, and good sushi. The set lunch was a fabulous deal for the quality of food. The tuna was well prepared and extremely fresh and my salad came with an amazing Yuzu dressing. I shared my fondness of the dressing to the waitress and to my delight, she returned with a small but complimentary second serving. We were overwhelmed, service like that happens in Singapore as often as a leap year. And as I continually remind my children, small gestures make big statements. That tiny but customized offering is why I will return the next time I need more than my ordinary salad bar lunch
5
I was searching a great bar & restaurant to dine with my partner on our anniversary day and pre-valentine's day celebration.I saw ku de ta but was taken aback by the poor reviews on food and services but only great on the great scenic view of our great country.I decided to take a risked since my partner always wanted to try out at ku de ta. To our greatest surprises,this place not only lived up to its expectation on the scenic view of singapore but with great ambience and also with great food and services esp Jess. She was brilliant with her stuff and provided great services and she went beyond what she needed to do by presenting us a surprise valentine's day signature desert...great place to be honestly
5
Whilst visiting Singapore with my young family, I decided to celebrate my wife's birthday at Ku De Ta. This was definitely one of our highlights of our trip. The views were amazing, the food was delicious and the service exceptional (our waiters name was Patrick). I had prearranged a surprise birthday cake and without a word being mentioned to my wife the cake was brought out at the perfect moment. All in all, it was a very memorable evening and would love to go back again one day soon
5
One of the best experience of culinary delight and breathtaking view of Singapore Skyline from 57th floor.The hostess-waitress was very helpful and ensured our group of different nationalities understand the menu and encourage us to try the specialties.Must visit for the view ambiance and foo
5
great place to have a few drinks and check out the awesome views from Ku de ta. Cool, breezy and a super way to enjoy some beers if you have the ringside seats overlooking the restaurant.
5
Absolutely fantastic, this is the great restaurant for international customer. The service was friendly and helpful. The beef was wonderful and the coconut was a really good dessert. The club was most fun and beautiful view. Highly recommended !!
5
Special thanks to Patrick and Ken for their excellent service with the amazing food and view at Ku Dé Ta. :)

Tried to book a table months in advance to make sure we had the reservation date we wanted. I was e-mailed back saying you could only book one month in advance and they would put me on a list and contact me one month before. Did not expect this to happen but sure enough exactly one month before I was contacted saying they had booked my table. When we arrived we were taken to a table right on the edge with one of the best views I have seen. Food and service were excellent and could not be faulted. Only annoyance was that people from the bar kept trying to stand in front of us to take pictures. They were very quickly told to move by waiting staff and that they were not allowed to block our view as it was for diners only. We will be back on our next visit to Singapore
5
Popped up to the 57th floor mainly for the view after telling security at ground level that we wanted a coffee. What we got was surely the best view in Singapore and some of the most carefully prepared food as ate a light lunch. Service wasn't quick. But we were in no hurry so that didn't bother us. The staff were all friendly and helpful when anything was asked for.A light lunch course, a desert, and a single beer cost us S$60 each
5
What a night at Ku De Ta, Singapore. It was the perfect setting for a long-overdue catch up with friends. We were amazed at the personalised service, the fantastic food and drinks. We had a table outside with a breathtaking view. The staff all made us feel at home immediately. Thanks to Zac for taking care of us all night, as well as Knut for his brilliant mixology!! Hira, your staff are amazing. Thanks also to the staff in the night club after dinner; so much fun! Thanks, Jeffrey. I would recommend Ku De Ta highly to anyone wanting a great night out. Fantastic atmosphere, faultless service and great food and drinks (and what a view!
5
this is one of those don't miss it places, the view is great. you can just go to a viewing gallery but if you don't have kids go to ku de ta, its an expensive evening but we did really enjoy it and you sit back and just think yep I'm living ! i booked by email 6 weeks before as a Saturday night.the bar area is the fun part you stand around the bar with the view sipping cocktails and taking the atmosphere in,the staff could be friendlier and more efficient i saw a few times they were a bit rude and would make people really hang on for change etc which starts to loose the special feeling of it.despite it what a great place to be on top of the world looking over marina bay sands and gardens and city view.we went to see the " wonderful" lazer show before on ground in front,you can not see from the top of building.we booked in advance but sadly they did try to sit us on a awful table under a huge speaker and i refused to sit here, they did move us inside which was ok, i was disappointed not to be outside as we kept waiting extra 30 mins after seating time booked,sadly no one was really showing any leadership and seemed to be lots of staff madly running around trying just keep up.the food was all excellent and wine well as say its a treat nothing cheap here. i think the service all round could be improved as it is i would say one of the best locations you could possibly have as a dining experience not my best ever but i would go again.they just need to remember who's paying them all to be there !they do try and call you re check your reservation, i did not switch on my phone but lucky they do email you too, other wise i guess you could loose you're booking if you don't reconfirm day before
3
This place is an absolute must see, especially at night for the wonderful view that you get of Singapore in all its neon splendour. However the staff are exceptionally rude, you really need to have the patience of a saint to get any service and if you dare ask for a receipt you get near spat on. Go. Enjoy. But not for long
5
It was a pleasure visiting this place which has a most spectacular view in Singapore, and one can relax to have their drinks with a delicious meals. Food portions are just right.. when you finish your meal with three courses, you don't feel full up. We tasted the most delicious Cod dish there. You can have a perfect relaxed dinner over a glass of Wine with great company, I have seen tables with couples, friends and families. Service is excellent nothing to complain about, all staffs are very professional. Please do a reservation for dinner and weekends are packed

We were staying at Marina Bay Sands for our Honeymoon. I carefully researched all high end restaurants in Singapore and decided to go here for dinner one night.I guess you're paying for the view. The food and service is honestly not worth the price you pay. We spent $240 NZD on two cocktails, 2 entrees and 2 mains. The cocktails took 40mins to come out and we actually started eating entrees before we got them. Pretty underwhelmed by the mains so decided to pass on dessert. Yes the food is tasty but there's so many places in singapore where you could get equally good pork belly, seafood and tempura. My recommendation is go up there for a drink and the view but eat somewhere else- for half the price
3
It's all about the view !, forget the food as not very memorable on a variety of levels ! Just grab some drinks and check out the amazing view !
3
First of all, the view is great from up there. Thats the only good thing. Drinks are just average, overpriced. So is the food. Just come here once if you are curious and thats it.
5
Wow! This is an amazing restaurant. The food and was 5 star (but like everything in Singapore very expensive). Service is great and the view is just breathtaking. It's by far the best view in Singapore. Oh, and there is free wifi!!
5
The headline says it all. It's a lovely environment, particularly if you are new to Singapore. From the skypark you get beautiful views, and the food is both creative and delicious. The only downsides are that it's crowded and quite expensive, with a pricey minimum. If you like to avoid typical tourist spots, this is not for you. But I think it's worth the experience
5
The opportunity to be able to take the time out to grab lunch, nay, ENJOY and RELAX for lunch was a true treat. Tried 2 cocktails (…!!) and both were real cocktails and not as watered down as many Singapore drinks can be… The food was just right, portions perfect and lovely taste was definitely trying to compete with the great view… I'll have to go back several times to see which one is the winner! I liked that during the day time I felt not rushed, could have a very decent conversation, and like I was getting a real treat, without the distractions that perhaps the evening service would entail with the night life revving up… Try this for an afternoon delight of another sort..
3
Had our first night meal at Ku Dé Ta restaurant (note that there is also a club/bar under the same name. Location is great, although it is facing toward the bay, not the city skyline. Still scenic. Gets very crowded, early reservation a must. Wind can get a little chilly, at least was the case that night.Food was ok, clearly not worth the price, even by casino resort standards. Shitake salad interesting but a bit drowned in siy sauce and small portion. I had lamb chops which were good, but got cold quickly. Chicken teriyaki was plain ordinary. not bad but ordinary. Certainly not worth 100 SGD a head (appetizer, entrée, 1 glass of wine, water, no dessert). Wine good but expensive, 25-30 SGD per glass. What made the whole experience forgettable was the waiter, friendly-pushy, but nowhere to be seen once it was clear that we were not going to have a 3rd course because we were cold and jetlagged.Going for drinks can be a good plan to enjoy the view, but it is very busy, very crowded. A bit like the entire 57th floor at Marina Bay Sands: it could be great, but it is so crowded, busy, loud, that it gets tiring fast and spoils the pleasure
5
I have had both lunch and dinner at KuDeTa Singapore recently. The quality of the service inside the restaurant is impeccable, the staff is really capable and attentive without being overbearing.I had a selection of dishes for my lunch and they were absolutely delicious, like the cocktails I tried... perfect for a lunch appointment, aimed at both man and women tastes...The view is incredible, worth spending some time in the restaurant sipping your drinks.I have not had yet the pleasure of attending the DJ nights on Friday and Saturday but I plan to do so soo
4
As other reviewers have stated, at 57 floors, near the marina and Singapore river, the view won't get much better. We arrived at 6 pm, so able to see during the night, and as night settled in, great experience to see the views by day and night. Our waiter, Faraq Khan, aka "Ku De Star" was a perfect fit for our crew, great sense of humor, knew the menu very well and suggested dishes that totally complimented each other, and fit our various tastes, inclusive of vegetarian diet, etc... Our team was very eclectic, from Hong Kong, Taiwan, India and the US, so not easy to satisfy everyone, but Faraq had his "A" game, and of course, he had the menu to back him up! Others mention price, I would say "value." Certainly, if you are going to a restaurant on top of a casino, at the 57th floor, in any major metropolitan area,has casual dress code, min. spend of S$80 per guest, the prices will match, what I look for is : did I get what I paid for? Was the food above average, the offerings unique, complimentary, etc... the answer here, to all - was simply yes. Perfect place to end a long hard work week w/ colleagues who joined in on a special project that went well
5
I've eaten lunch and dinner at KU DE TA and both have been great meals in an amazing setting. The drink menu is so cool with creative concoctions that are the perfect start to your meal. My first meal was a dinner there and I was so impressed with the views from the terraces at KU DE TA - we could so the amazing light show going on down in the marina area! The meal was great and we shared a wonderful dessert to finish off the evening. When I went up there for lunch on another visit, I was amazed at how far I could see during the day - I really had a view of almost every part of Singapore. Both meals were wonderful and will be going back soon
4
The view and atmosphere is just 10/10. Definitely a must when visiting Singapore even if it is solely for the view. Fab, strong cocktails. Excellent wine/champagne list. its just a fab time all round. It is definitely on the expensive side but as a treat or celebration it is just amazing
3
Nice view, as you would expect. Very expensive and not that good really, more for the view and tourists. Service also a bit slow.
5
Food and cocktail selection is one of the best in Singapore. Great vibe in the evenings, especially good if you go during a theme night. The prices are in the higher end but worth for the atmosphere.
3
Quite simply you psy for the spectacular views at Ku De Ta. The restaurant is nicely designed, the service is very good, the prices are high, but unfortunately the food is very average. Good venue for a drink but save your money and eat elsewhere.
4
Just went here for the view - and to get a drink in exchange for money versus the SkyPark tourist deck which costs circa $25 for view only. Had a cocktail for $28 (and they don't offer Slings - in fact they have a poke at the Sling on their cocktail menu with the comment - about another cocktail - "nothing pink and sticky about this one"). "Columbus" cocktail drink was good and the view was nice but resisted having a second at that price. Everybody else seemed to be there for the same reason. Was getting quite crowded around 5:30-6pm and you can only stand - they reserve tables for diners only and the area they restrict bar guests to is really small. Could not glimpse the hotel pool due to the "no go" zone.Note for guys - after 5pm they must wear long trousers; women can wear whatever but I saw quite a few people being denied access at ground level because of wearing shorts.Not sure I would go again or even recommend it. I've seen a few city skylines from up high in my life and while it is useful to get an overall perspective of the city, a map is not a bad alternative. You have no sense that you're on a ship like shape in the middle of the sky!Go if you like heights and viewing cities - otherwise save your money and have two drinks at a bar at lower altitude for the same price. Next time, I think I would splurge and get a basic room at the hotel for USD400-500 per night to experience the pool and bar and skypark deck without restrictions.Did not eat
5
This restaurant is shaped as a boat sitting on top & straddling 3 sky scrapers, its on the 57th floor, the views are unbelievable & there is a laser show at night, I was lucky enough to see the view in daylight & at night. there's an infinity pool & night club, it really is something else, but pricey, I chose a Omni sirloin steak cost Â£120 & side dishes are extra, I don't know what the final bill was but this place is not cheap but really worth it for that something specia

I wanted to get a view of the city and the tourist-sky lounge deck was around $23 to enter (and there is nowhere to have a drink). The better option turned out to be simply heading up to Ku De Ta wine bar which has no cover charge. A glass of wine was pretty expensive, around $15USD, but the view was great, and still cheaper all up than taking the non-drinking tourist option :

Good but not great views especially if there is a bit of smog around. A far better view can be found at the top of the 70 storey Westin and for a lot cheaper. We had the brunch and while the food was very good, it was not worth the money spent. It's Japanese so perhaps we have been spoilt by living in Japan and eating the same quality food for a quarter of the price. It's a great idea to have an open restaurant and bar with views but I think other cities such as Bangkok do them so much better. Ku de tai is tucked away in a corner of the building and delivers mainly coastal views while the best city views are reserved for hotel and skypark guests. For $157 odd dollars per person for brunch with alcohol I think a look at the city view should be included. It's good for a tourist once but I couldn't imagine it having repeat customers
5
We decided to try the 57th top floor restaurant at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel because of the stupendous view. Lo-and-behold it turned out to be an excellent Japanese restaurant with good food, impeccable service and, yes a great view. While a bit pricey it was well worth it. Thoroughly enjoyed every moment. Oh yes, we were even given new black shawls to ward off the air conditioning which were our to keep. How about that fr service

We followed the advice of Tripadvisors and visited Ku De Tat rather than the observation deck of Marina Bay Sands and are very glad that we did! The outdoor drinks area was nicely furnished and the staff were very attentive. My partner's Mai Tai and my Berry Bellini were both delicious and the price was not excessive by Singapore standards! It was very windy but the views were amazing. To my mind, this is a much better option than going to the observation deck: you pay for a drink but get same view as those who pay simply to go to the deck! There was no pressure to buy more than one drink and also no pressure to leave quickly which was very pleasing
4
If you were not a guest in MBS, would be a good idea to go up to the bars or restaurants for meal/ drink at MBS.The outdoor bar has a good view of Singapore city. cocktails at around SGN 24 per glass. Staff were professional. However, the place (bar area) is pretty small and could be filled up of tourists. Also, be reminded that it gets pretty windy up there.
4
Nothing like dinner at the top of Marina Bay Sands. Memorable meal and a memorable life experience.
Well done!
5
The view, the ambience, the food, the drinks, the service. Just Perfect. Would definitely recommend to anyone in Singapore

I just we to ku de ta for lunch. I went for the bento option in the restaurant ( skybar) section. I booked it with reservations this morning through email and got very quick response which was great. I chose the bento option as it seemed worth while money wise. It was 38 SGD ++ and I had a cocktail which was yummy called a storm cooler it was $24 SGD++. I asked for a table outside which is on first come first served basis. I arrived at 12:45 (15 mins early) and was given a nice table outside. Was quiet windy but great view. You can choose either fish (dory) or steak with the bento option. I chose the dory was crispy on the outside and very tasty. The dessert that comes with the bento tray was lovely as well. Staff were very nice and friendly. I had a great view of the Singapore flyer and all that was around it. The observation deck was just down one level. There is no access to it from the restaurant but u can see everything from the restaurant so it's just as nice to have a bite and a drink there. If you pay for access to the observation deck there is no access to the restaurant. Once your in the restaurant you can also go over to the club lounge which is also under the name of ku de ta and sip a drink whilst enjoyin the view broke and a view of the gorgeous infinity pool. Access to the infinity pool is reserved for hotel guests but you can still see it from the club lounge and get pictures. I noticed as well the club lounge does pizza and paninis. More casual restaurant but also nice. Access to these restaurants is from tower three. You will see the ku de ta reception desk on the right hand side as you go into tower 3 and they will direct you to a lift that will take you to the 57th floor. Enjoy 
5
Everything here was amazing from the cocktails to the entree to the dessert. The service was also great, the waitress for able to recommend a divine dessert which did not disappoint. The view is also spectacular! Yes it's pricy, but you know that going up and overall it's a wonderful experience!

"Never Fails to impress"...That's what we were told when we asked a friend who knew Singapore where to go for a special night out. Indeed KuDeTa did impress as we took the 6.30 dinner sitting and watched the sun go down on a lovely clear evening. We took a table for 5 and did one tasting menu (for 2) and three other dishes straight mains. As a result we shared a wide variety of delicious courses. Its pricey but we got in with only 24 hrs notice. The view really is the star and while the food is good it's not Michelin-starred good. It was busy too; bustling without being overcrowded
2
KuDeTa in Bali used to be one of the greatest restaurants in Asia. You would think that the Singapore operation would meet this grade. Unfortunately its all view and full of people who flock there for the scenic tourism but the class, sophistication, food and beverage of the old KuDeTa (Bali) is simply not here. The food is ok but not great, the drinks are average and certainly not of the standard that Bali was able to consistently deliver. The bar and restaurant is separated which is good but honestly this spot is rubbish in comparison to what is could or should be. Wine is stupidly priced, so expensive you simply couldn't drink it?When speaking to the management and doing our routine 100 questions to feel them out a bit, he simply told us how much money they are making. Tut Tut, this is not the done thing?I feel this venue is simply a tourist destination and not a serious dining offering
5
Brunch was wonderful, a fresh selection of oysters and sashimi, followed by tempura vegetables and a choice of main. It's a lot of food and I left totally satisfied, also a little wobbly after a few glasses of champagne. My only issue was that after spending a couple of hundred dollars just for myself at the restaurant I was unable to go to the viewing platform, without paying a further charge. The view is amazing from the restaurant, but it would have been nice to have the extra space and photo op. That aside, it was a wonderful meal
5
Spectacular views, great ambience and great food.Our waitress Ara was fantastic and really knowledgable. I'd highly recommend the taster menu - pricey but delicious. Wine is super expensive by but this is pretty standard across Singapore.TIPS: best time is for du set. We had our table booked for 6.45 and arrived at 6.15 - perfect timing. If you dine in the restaurant you get free entry to the bar next to the infinity pools, just hang on to you receipt. It doesn't give you access to the pool but at least you get to ogle at how the other half live.Also, dont waste your money on tickets to the sky tour. Just head up to the restaurant and have a drink and you get to see the same views
5
Contrary to other reviewers our experience was chilled, with attentive helpful staff and an extremely tasty and alcoholic white sangria. We spent well over an hour enjoying the ambience as well as the drinks on our last afternoon in Singapore before flying to Melbourne in the late evening. I cannot comment on the food prices but did not find the drinks menu to be any more expensive than other comparable venues
4
We had an early dinner before the Michael Buble show. The view from the Bar was great. Drinks were refreshing. I had a mojito to start the evening.The dinner was very good. Ryan helped up on choices. We particularly liked the Shrimp Salad; Hokkaido Scallops, the Seared Salmon and the Chocolate Lave Cake with Raspberry. The soft shell roll and the chu-toro was average. The rice for the roll were a bit overcooked. Wines were quite good. A must do while in Singapore
5
this is the place to go for the best view of Singapore at night.mask for an outside table. We had a lovely breeze which helped to keep us a nice temperature.
Great night, good food.
4
The atmosphere is nice, the scenic view of Singapore especially at night ... the food is standard, mostly japanese food and some western menus... it is more for business lobying place, you have to spend at least SGD 80/person to have dinner here... it is Singapore new icon
3
The location on the top floor of Marina Bay Sands gives this restaurant a MUST SEE status. The food is average to above average for this category. Because we booked late we got only a table an hour before the restaurant closed. The staff was a bit impatient and the courses for us 3 arrived at different times. I had expected a higher bill in the end, so it was a fair price for the dinner
1
Being located 57 storeys high is the one and only saving grace of this venue..The cuisine is comprehensively devoid of any panache and the work force are abrupt and uncivilised.Go for the view, that's it!
4
really do not have any other words for this place excellent place to chill out . nice music and a very good dance floor.the view from this place is just mind blowing . even though the bar is expensive it is worth a visit gets really crowded late in the evenings so make sure you are there on time .Just had a few drinks there was a good experienc
4
After returning via Myanmar I was looking for my Asian food. Here it ticked 2 boxes for me good Asian food and a great view while eating at the same time.Tip - night time meal is recommended so you can enjoy the sunset and good foo
3
The good: View. Only the view. Hyped up by the view. Food was ordinary, very expensive. We had dinner reservation at 8 and arrived 15 mins early. The host recommended we wait at the bar & they will call us when our table is ready. It was very crowded & difficult to move around the tight space with everyone jostling for a view. We ordered 2 cocktails and the bill was over $80. Food was nothing spectacular. Very forgettable. Too pricey if you don't even get table with a view. It was not worth it.
5
The place is full of energy and vibrance as its distinct placement over the top of three buildings and gives the dinners the great view @ 360 degrees . serve finest food along with finest wines.the Bar is too well placed on the open space and offers the finest drinks and the service is excellent
5
Having fought our way through a tropical downpour and catching the wrong tube train we were hoping we wouldn't be disappointed. Like the majority of reviewers we weren't. The views are spectacular especially when the rain stops. Given the weather we chose to eat inside but are glad we did. The ambience is just right likewise the lighting which allows diners to take in the views. Reading the menu in the semi dark could be a tad difficult but clip on lights solve this. So to the food. Exquisite flavours some we haven't tasted before others we knew but somehow more subtle here. Whilst it helps to know what one is ordering there is a frisson to ordering something you think you know but it turns out slightly different. But still tasty. The wine selection is good but be warned pricey. As it was our wedding anniversary we turned a blind eye to this.A splendid evening and a 'must visit' place when visiting Singapor
4
It's a great place, food is amazing, actually one of the best Asian foods I had in Singapore.The view is outstanding, I loved it a lot. It's great to be outside and have a cocktail.I was just missing a bit the hosting feeling., The service was professional but not very personal or spending any time with us
4
Excellent 360degree view 200m tall building MBS(Marina Bay Sand).Can enjoyed nice drink at club lounge around $38....(relax dress codes )or finest in modern sian food at $80++......
KU DE TA
5
Everyone else says it- but I must repeat. The view here is amazing! Of course, dining on level 57 with the Skybar and Infinity pool just outside does not disappoint. But definitely prepare yourself for the price tag. A meal for 2 on New Years Day set me & my boyfriend back $340 SGD. But it was all worth it
5
Ate here with clients.Firstly the views are amazing and the atmosphere is very inviting.We ate at an outside table and it really was stunning. The staff was very pleasant and professional.The food was excellent and well worth the money.One of our guests was due for retirement and we had organized a present to be delivered from one of the shops downstairs in the mall. The staff stored it for us then presented it. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and the whole experience was memorable
4
I went to Ku De Ta simply for the view, which by the way was spectacular, and I lucked out to have a clear day. I went early afternoon, and chose to have a glass of champagne to celebrate the view. Wasn't prepared for the $36 price tag, but you have to know you have to pay for the view. If the view is really your primary goal, just pay to go to the observation deck on the floor below. Its less expensive than a glass of champagne and offers unobstructed views. I cant review the menu or lightlife here, since I didn't experience either...
5
First off I doubt you will find such a view at any place in your life. As long as the weather is nice try to sit outside near the edge. We were lucky enough to get a seat when they opened so our service was good since we were obviously one of first seated. This is a high end restaurant so make sure to bring your credit card. Dinner w/ a couple of drinks cost us about $275 US. I have to say that the food quality matched and views. Every aspect of our food was great from the appetizer to the main course. You can have a drink at the outside bar, but if you have the opportunity to dine here and would like a great meal with INSANE views this is a must. I would definitely go back next time I visit Singapore

Have brought my family including my elderly parents for a trip to Singapore.Thought we might have a look at the Singapore Flyer and the Marina Bay Sands as it seemed they were pretty close together.By the time we got ourselves organised it was lunch time so decided to look in MBS first and get a bight to eat prior to going to the Flyer.Taxi driver advised that to go to the top of MBS you need to go to Tower 3.Once we entered, it was not obvious how we could just go to the top for a look. However, the KuDeTa restaurant had a desk and we discovered that their restaurant was up the top.Sounded like a good idea. Lunch and a view.So, we headed up.Gotta say, it was a terrific decision. Everything about the restaurant was perfect. Menu, food, service and of course the view. While not cheap, it was not that expensive either. We had the Lunch Special Bento box (which was the most amazing Bento Box I have ever seen) and for 5 of us including cocktails, beers, wine, desert and tea / coffee was just over SGD 100 per head.Worth every penny and would highly recommend. My Father, who is extremely particular and difficult to cater for, thinks it was the best restaurant meal he had ever experienced.We were pretty casually dressed which is ok during the day (shorts and things) but please note that a dress code is applied after 5:30 pm
5
We had Xmas dinner last December. Food is very well prepared, one of best sushi I've ever tried. It's a bit expensive, but you got to bear in mind you are at one of the most privileged spot of the city. Beautiful view for memorable pics
5
This is definitely a place you need to go with room on your credit card. It is well worth the money though as the food is divine and the service is excellent.The views from here are stunning. The restaurant and the bar are both really funky and have a great atmosphere.If you don't mind spending some $$ this is a great place to go. If you are on a budget I would only suggest the bar for a couple of drinks as the view is still a must see
5
One of the classics in Singapore. Beautiful view with catchy tunes and great food.The restaurant has many foods to choose from, including for vegetarians and vegans. The lounge offers snacks only.Ps- sangria is a good deal- for 40 sgd you get 4 glasses of delicious drin
4
Ku De Ta has a good brunch spread with a four course meal with rose champagne. It's got great ambience and good for a weekend brunch! The Japanese style spread is fantastic and is a refreshing experience. It's a bit on the expensive side, but worth it
5
We had dinner here on our last night in Singapore. The food was fantastic, the wine was divine. We didn't go in until 10pm and there were alot of people dining at that time. Great place to eat.
5
We went to Ku De Ta for drinks and dinner. The view at sunset over Singapore is just stunning and as darkness sets in, a fairyland of lights. Drinks and food are expensive, but it is a lovely night out for a special treat.
5
We enjoyed a delicious lunch served by friendly, attentive staff high atop the Marina Bay Sands.The food was freshly prepared, creative and used authentic ingredients from around the world- every bite was a revelation.When I discovered I had left my credit card back in our hotel room the manager calmly came up with a creative solution and took excellent care of my wife while I sorted things out.Thanks so much to everyone for your superb service

I came here for lunch when vacationing in Singapore as I heard good things about the restaurant from reviews. I placed a reservation a couple weeks in advanced to ensure that I would have a table. The restaurant is located in Tower 3 of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The greeting process was friendly and my table was ready as soon as I arrived. I sat inside and on the lower level of the restaurant. The menu was quite large and offered a variety of dishes. They offered a set lunch menu which included dishes such as sushi, salmon, steamed rice, pork belly and a dessert. The quality of the food served was very good, with the exception of the dessert tray. It didn't appear to compliment the rest of the food and was only standard at best. With that said however the martini drinks they served were excellent. The service was friendly and good however it appeared that our waiter disappeared for quite some time after our dessert was served. We waited for 10 minutes and even though one of the managers noticed we were waiting for someone to come by, he did not acknowledge us or his wait staff to engage. We ended up chasing a waiter down for the bill. After my meal I decided to check out the outdoor bar and ordered a martini. After having a few sips I noticed immediately that the quality of the drink did not live up to the one I ordered inside. It was apparent that there were some inconsistencies so my advice would be to order drinks inside and ask to take them outside. Overall, the restaurant, coupled with the view and food makes for a good time but be sure to bring enough money for the over-priced drinks that are offered

I had lunch at KU DE TA shortly after arriving in Singapore on vacation. The restaurant includes amazing panoramic views of the Marina Bay, as well as complimentary access to an observation patio outside the restaurant. We were promptly seated and were surprised by the busyness of the restaurant, given we arrived for a late lunch. The waiter was quick to recommend the tasting menu, which is specifically designated for two people. We accepted his recommendation and were highly impressed with the food delivered to us, which included edamame, sushi rolls and sashimi. The sushi itself was so fresh it did not even require soy sauce. The remaining courses were equally impressive and delicious, as were the inventive and refreshing cocktails. My only gripe with this restaurant is the seating as the tables are quite close together so you can often hear your neighbor's conversation. The price of the food is also somewhat high, although understandable given the quality of the food. Overall, this is a great place to grab lunch or a drink while on vacation and enjoy the view of Singapore. Be sure to bring your camera as you will want to snap many pictures on the outdoor patio area
5
Great food and Champagne pairing menu for New Years! Thoughtful menu compilation and delectable tastes strike a home run alongside excellent champagne. The above combo is usually a win where ever you are but this time round was given a dose of extra greatness due to our wonderful Server PJ. Most excellent work!If you can afford the decadence for New Years, it's wholly worth most every sing dollar. If not in the budget, just go up for a drink and soak in the surroundings while surrounded by (sorry about this one ding) awful teen angst techno beats. The view makes up for the horrible music, however, in spades
5
Didn't eat any food here but came up during the day for a drink but mostly the view, you can't beat it! The view is fantastic and you get to see the infamous pool! We decided to get a drink here instead of paying for the observation deck and I definitely recommend it. For about the same price (drinks are $24-26S) you get the same view as the observation deck. While $24 is a completely absurd amount of money for a drink, you're paying for the experience and I think even saving money (the observation deck is more expensive). Plus, on the observation deck you are unable to look at the pool and you can't on the observation deck
4
Based on the TA reviews of paying for the view only, we opted for the Ku De Ta for lunch so we could have lunch and views. We ended up having both lunch and then staying for drinks.TIP: Go for lunch if you are going for food and views. If you go to Ku De Ta for dinner, there is a S$80 minimum spend requirement, which is not in effect for lunch.Second TIP: Get the three-course taster menu to enjoy everything. We enjoyed drinks, food and views. For the lunch taster menu, both the salmon and pork entree options were great but the pork was surprisingly tasty. The three-course lunch is S$58, not cheap, but with the views and experience, we felt that it was better than paying only for a view, which did not include food or sitting down to relax for as long as we wanted to stay.If after lunch you want to enjoy the experience even further, splurge on drinks. They are not cheap (about S$25 each), but the people watching and experience, particularly if the wind is blowing hard, is well worth it
5
Food was great, service was great, but you would go here even if it wasn't just for the views. Skip paying to go up to the observation deck and go straight to the bar or Ku de ta for lunch. Another memorable highlight of Singapore. Well worth a loo

I had the misfortune to dine her with my husband on the 29th December. We had the quail, pork belly lollipops, beef and also the spicy prawns, all of which were tasteless and grossly over priced. We were in and out within 40 minutes....which was a blessing in disguise in the end! Had the food been good, we wouldn't have minded the price but seeing as the food was the worst we've had at any restaurant in at least the past 6 months, we were very disappointed and annoyed. I do not recommend you dine here. Take photos of the city and have a drink but do not eat. Having said this, the calamari in the Ku De Ta BAR, earlier in the day, was one of the best I've ever had. The restaurant is also very dark and very noisy. Complete waste of time and money
4
No cover charge on Sunday nights
Go straight up to 57th floor ignore the observation deck line and avoid the fee.
Order a drink if you want (didnt seem mandatory) but drinx were delish and pricey
Dance the night away as live DJ spins
5
One of the best pitstop I have in Asia try going on a week night to avoid too much crowd, food is well presented mustry their maki's and cocktails all you got to do is chill and enjoy the skyline at night of singapore
5
We didn't eat here but went for cocktails. Probably the best cocktails in Singapore and definitely the best views. Not cheap but alcohol in general is expensive in Singapore so no surprise. Don't leave Singapore without going here!
5
Very unique place and experience , very unique customer service (Thank you Ken) and the best fondant ever!
5
What an experience from start to finish. The view was amazing, the food was excellent and very well priced considering the large servings. The drinks choice was extensive and our waiter Ryan was a delight. We were there for my 40th birthday and they couldn't have made it more special. Just be sure to book in advance
5
Ku de Ta was fe on mended to us as a 'must do' during a recent holiday to SingaporeIt was well worth the visit. The restaurant is on top of the Marina BaySands, so the view of the city is spectacular in its own rightThe food is wonderful, its the best Japanese we have ever had. Staff were attentive without being pushy. The food was superb, not a bad dish amongst it. If I had to choose a favourite, it was probably the squid followed closely by the shiitake mushroom saladPut it on your list if you are visiting Singapor
4
You need to visit this place for the view. A 360 degree panoramic view of singapore. Truley a beautiful dining experience. we had been there for our anniversary. it was totally worth. there is a disc close by. you can hop on to that too. food is good. We were given a center table. on request the staff obliged to us and gave us a corner table with a unobstructed view.very friendly staff.do visit this place
4
Been there twice over the last two years..not a place to be for dinking as prices are expensive a d movement are restricted within.restaurant dinning was good n being invited by my Ceo from Spain, we had fingers food n drinks for abt 10ppl n understand the night costs around $3k..another visit jyst to bring a visitor for the high experience with drinks and due to crowds, we can only stand around bar counter. .needs good camera if you want good shoots at nit

Been there to celebrate 50th birthday of my husband on Christmas Day and we had a fabulous meal. Rita our waitress surprised my husband with a cake tope with a sparkling candle. Since we sat until the end of our meal Rita was taking care of us

KU DÉ TA is certainly not an economy restaurant, the reason been of its location. It offered the finest in Modern Asian cuisine, drinking and entertainment, perched 230 meters on the high point of the stunning Marina Bay Sands hotel. It’s a feast for the minds as the venue offers customers a 360-degree panoramic view of the city's skyline and the Straits of Singapore south china seas. KU DÉ TA maintains a round-the-clock enthusiasm, offering everything from hearty breakfasts to late-night supper. Breathtaking views from the terrace restaurant with observant staff and excellent food and drinks. A reservation is essential unquestionably worth taking the trouble. It’s one of the best restaurants for its whereabouts. Essential to visit while you are in Singapore. Our visit was on the weekend and it was overcrowded, and of course overpriced, again Singapore view from Ku de Ta it’s worth the visit, and a place to be
4
Well the overall experience was special. The waiter explained concept of the menu servings which were very 'tapas' oriented and meant to be shared. That was fine but I thought the food could have been better. Taste wise. And Service was excellent.
5
The food was good, the waiter attention to details was fantastic, I was served by Rita I think, but not quite sure now. It was several a fantastic experience. I will return.... I had the sired tuna!! Mmmmm!
3
on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands complex, it is an eclectic mix of outdoor and indoor seating, an equally eclectic mix of dishes--some fusion and all fresh; a good cocktails and wine list and can get busy.
5
We had Christmas dinner at KuDeTa last night. We opted for the pairing menu (without wine pairings), and I must say the food and the way it was presented was beautiful. If you go for the pairing, make sure you have adequate time and an empty stomach - it was amazing, but a lot of food!Unfortunately it was raining when we went, so the outside deck was closed. Eitherway, the atmosphere was great! Service was unbeatable - Ken was our server, and he did a great job! He paid attention to detail, and made everything run smoothly from appetizer to desert. For a special occasion, or simply a nice view, I would definitely recommend KuDeTa for dinner
3
Stunning view and a must for people to visit Singapore BUT overcrowded on week End andof course overpricedFood is ok but it is not the target to be there , again Singapore view from Ku de Ta worth thevisit and we forget all the inconvenient. A place to b

Horrible dining experience during stay in Singapore! Over priced sushi especially for amount of fish included., pork belly was almost raw had to ask to send back while the seared tuna was cold. Felt like they had heated food in microwave. Waiter did all he could (discounted one of the pork)but management was a let down. Would advise against dining, the view is free..
5
We booked a table at Ku De Ta to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary, whilst we were holidaying in Singapore....we were not disappointed!We were greeted by Faraq Khan who explained the concept of the menu and ensured that we had drinks immediately as we sat down. The menu was amazing, and it was great that we were able to share and taste the different dishes as it would have been very difficult to choose just one!Faraq had arranged a very special desert for us which was very touching and very much appreciated, thank you Faraq.This isn't a cheap restaurant, but you wouldn't expect it to be because of its position, BUT it is well worth a visit and if we come back to Singapore in the future, we will definitely be making a reservation
5
We were going to go up to the observation deck on the 57th floor when the woman who was selling us our tickets for the viewing said that access to the bar and restaurant is free from the lobby level of the third tower (immediately to the right of the lobby entrance) of the hotel during the day, so you donâ€™t have to get in the cue to go to the Sky Park. (The ticket cue is located in the basement level of tower 3.) In the daytime the bar is crowded but reservations are not necessary. Reservations are usually needed for dining at night. We went for a glass of wine and phenomenal views of Singapore. Worth the price of a drink
5
Ku De Ta is not just a great name, but a destination restaurant at the top of Marina Bay Sands hotel complex. Breathtaking views from the terrace restaurant with attentive staff and excellent food and drinks. Reservations required but definitely worth taking the trouble as once you are there you can sit there sip great cocktails, savour delightful foods and enjoy the views! One of the best restaurant locations
4
Their staff, specifically Arlan and Janice were very accomodating and welcoming. The food was fantastic and the service was second to none
3
So finally, visitted this restaurant last week, I had shrimps and my friend had salmon. Well, the food was so-so, nothing special, but kind of pricey. View is great of course.
5
What a view! Such a gorgeous setting and super service. Thanks to Junaith for getting us a table at such short notice and Arhie for the great menu recommendations.
4
It has indoor and alfresco sitting and alfresco tend to have other patrons who are busy talking or drinking as there is a standup bar nearby.As it gets dark tiny table lamps are placed at your table and you have difficulty seeing what morsels you are savouring.View is heavenly as Singapore is presented to you above the Skypark. It is pricey as we paid over S$350 for 3 and it is Asian European fusion and for that price I expected more out of its flavor and cuisine
5
I have not been for such a meal before. Although the menue can be overwhelming , sithra who was responsible for our table, made the choices enjoyable and was exceptional with her advise . Thanks Sithra. I will certainly be back and I fully recommend the whole experience
5
We arrived in Singapore in The morning and emailed the restaurant to reserve table for bruch. We received confirmation quite fast and they were flexible with holding The table, as we were a bit delayed. The brunch is delicious. The spinach With shrimps and truffle oil was really Nice. And the dessert buffet was great! The service was excellent. We got the table with The best view, and the manager was very helpful!!The view is stunning. Really worth going to keduta. We went back for drinks the next evening. The view by night is even more beautiful!
3
While the service and ambience was lovely I felt let down by the food. It was ok. Edible enough, but for the price you pay and the ambience you get...more is expected. Even things like proportion of seasoning...could have been better balanced. Go for the experience but I doubt there would be many repeat visits
5
we had no difficulty getting a table with a spectacular view without a reservation. Faraq Khan was our attentive server. The service is tapas style with small plates to share. The wine list is excellent. We had delicious dishes of scallops, mushrooms, rice, broccolini, (much more descriptive names) and presented as works of art. The pace was civilized with no feeling of being hurried. Food was perfection, service was impeccable. The view was stunning. I highly recommend Ku de ta.

We had a nice table with a city view, though the other people were just walking around our table to reach the balcony and take a photo. That was disturbing so much that we did not feel cosy nor romantic. Wish they had separated the access for the bar attenders. The menu is a bit limited, not super delicious and expensive. The couch was super comfy

It was a shirt daybtrip to Singapore and we had a couple of hours to kill before our flight at 10pm. We decided to have a quick dinner at ku de ta atop Marina Sands on the 57th floor and we were very fortunate to have a table for us at 6pm. We were worried that we might not be able to make it in time for check in at 8pm but food arrived very quickly within minutes! The appetisers were fantastic. We especially enjoyed the sashimi as they were really fresh and tasty. The foie gras was very commendable as well. All in, the food was excellent and to our surprise the portions were reasonably big and not too pricey for the ambience and view.Special mention must be given to Patrick who served our table for his excellent service and recommendations. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and look forward to going there again

Ate here for an anniversary meal we booked well in advance of our stay. Requested one of the tables on the side of the city for the excellent views and although they said at the time of booking they couldn't guarantee it they would make a note. Well we got the exact table we wanted and couldn't have been happier about it. The menu is amazing with a great array of Pan-asian cuisine as well as excellent steaks. For starters we had the California rolls and the smoked salmon roll tempura and it was probably the best sushi I have ever eaten. For the main I had the US prime ‘brandt beef’ ribeye and that was also absolutely delicious. I loved the wasabi that went with it. My date had the Steamed Halibut which was wrapped in banana leaves which she also loved. Excellent service from our waiter. Had a bottle of wine and then and after dinner whiskey and the total came to about 300SGD. Pricey meal but to be honest, for the occasion, the ambience, and the quality of food and service, and well the location/view is not too bad either, I was more than happy to have paid it. If you are able to, I would highly recommend eating here as it was one of the nicest dining experiences of my life. The bar area as well was really hip and quite packed. Also head to the lounge after if you feel like partying even more into the night

All the staff, especially our waitress PJ was lovely and professional. Everyone but I knew that we were going to get engaged. They made the night very special for us. The view, food, wine and atmosphere was great. Thanks.
3
You pay the view which is indeed great. I will remember it for the view but already forgot what was the food we ordered.
5
My family visited my fiance and I in Singapore. We showed them around and they enjoyed their stay. We ended our gathering by having our last dinner together here in Singapore by dining in Kudeta. It was just perfect! The atmosphere, food, view and service were just great! The staff are also very friendly and accommodating. My mom wasn't feeling well that time and Marniza, the waitress that was assisting us, was kind enough to give her hot water eventhough we have not requested yet.
4
This place is absolutely stunning. Food and drinks are great however on the pricey side. If you go for a drink before 6pm you don't need to pay entry and I recommend this over paying for the viewing deck. At least that way you get a drink while you enjoy the view. Just be warned of the dress regulations. Must see when in Singapore
4
What else would one expect from a roof top extravaganza . Food with a view to match . Drop into the night club after dinner . The place has an excellent international vibe , good menu , good food and a fine crowd . If you want it in marina bay sands , then this is a good place to eat . If you have time to venture away and out then there are so many options that one can try . Singapore has great food in general and one can keep experimenting if you have time

Ku De Ta, Tower 3 in MBS, has one of the best views in town. I prefer going there around the sunset time, so that you have the stunning sunset over the skyline.For 1 beer and 2 longdrinks we paid SGD 77, which is fair given the location & view
4
I wish there was a rating somewhere between average & very good and I would probably put Ku de Ta in there.I didn't eat at the restaurant but visited the bar specifically for cocktails.I arrived reasonably early but not before the cover charge of $28 kicked in. I was allowed to proceed up to the bar to have a couple of drinks without paying the cover charge (which was lucky as otherwise I wouldn't have visited at all). I'm not sure what the purpose of the charge is as I would personally look for somewhere else to go and spend that cash inside rather than waste it!The cocktails were ok - not the best I've had but certainly not the worst (I had a variation of a sour) but they are pricey, especially once you add taxes on top of the prices advertised. Also, there are very few non alcoholic choices that aren't either soda's or juice (no mocktails or juice blends)Service was a little slower than I expected considering it was not terribly busy but at least the view was lovely so you had something to look at while you waited.When I left the line to go up to the bar was ridiculously long - it may have been around 9.30ish?Overall I'm glad I visited but I probably wouldn't go again just for drinks. I think you can find better value elsewhere and I certainly would not be going if the cover charge was being enforced
4
Had drinks herre 2 nights running as we were staying at MBS. The drinks were great, atmosphere was good and the view of course was probably the best in Singapore. Didn't eat here so can't comment on that but would certainly visit again for drinks if we were back in Singapore

Having seen this new Singapore landmark on TV during the formula one race days, this was on our bucket list as a "must visit" destination. There is no doubt that it has the "wow factor" right from arrival to departing and the views are amazing. Sadly the restaurant, while OK the menu was "interesting" but disappointing. It was I presume an attempt at "fusion" a mix of European, Japanese and Asia. A lot of dishes were served cold and in a TAPAS style which is not to everyone's taste. Personally I found the menu quiet good but the service was slow and noisy and not what you would expect at the prices. The inside tables are very dark and noisy with no view and so book in advance for an outside table with a view You are paying for the location and view which to some extent is OK as it is EXCEPTIONAL. SO - it is worth a visit but maybe pay only for the view and give the restaurant a miss and eat pepper and chilli crab and a jug of Tiger beer at JUMBOS on the East Coast for 1/10th of the price!

The view is great and that's about it really. We had a couple of drinks in the early evening and the crowd started to fill up. Soon it really didn't matter whether you're on the top floor or basement
5
Ku De Ta offers the best view in Singapore....admiring it with awesome drink. The best way to spend happy hour :)
3
While the view and the overall experience of being atop the MBS is stunning, the food and atmosphere of the restaurant itself is average, at best.
Poor value for money on the culinary side, but that may not be why you go.
4
The restaurant presents a really good view of Singapore, but is very pricey. It's at the top of Marina Sands, and there is no fee to take the elevator up, as there is to the viewing deck.
4
We went up for a drink in the morning and spent about 2 hours there, just relaxing and taking it all in! WOW!
5
My family was there for dinner to celebrate my daughter 18th birthday. We were served by a waitess name Kini and she was very attentive toward us. We were serve by Leonard and Nancy at the Sky Bar and their service was good. Overall foods were good and my mother like it very much. The scenery was beautiful and breezy. We will sure recommand to our friends. Most of the staff were always putting on a smile and their service was good
5
Visited this restaurant with my wife for our 40th wedding anniversary. As soon as we vacated the lift at the 57th floor we knew we were in for a great night. From the receptionist who showed us to our table, to our waitress, the service could not be faulted.Our table was almost to the edge and the view of Singapore harbour and the city was spectacular.Our waitress Shara introduced the menu and explained in detail how the sharing menu worked. She even recommended some of her favourite dishes. Really she could not do enough for us and took several photos for us. The food was very nice and while small servings you know in advance about this and order more dishes if required. The wine prices are expensive so we had cocktails and galsses of champagne instead.The desserts are delicious so make sure you leave enough room for these.All in all we had a fantastic evening and it was a special way to celebrate our anniversary
5
My husband and I were celebrating my birthday by having dinner at this fabulous place. The food wasn't THAT great but the view is truly to die for especially during the sunset coupled with a nice calm breeze. Just the most perfect setting that you would ever ask for. The background music was was pretty alright too, nothing too fancy, exactly what you would expect at these kind of restaurants (not that it's a bad thing, its nice! Was very calming), but apparently, they have live DJs to come in and play as well which is when my evening REALLY started to pick up; I had asked one of the servers for a CD of the music they were playing but apparently I was told it was a live Dj playing. And true enough, I see this young gentleman of Sikh ethnicity playing some live GOOD music! It was awesome! We decided and ended up staying for a few drinks after as we had to give up the table for other reservations but we were not disappointed! I would really like to personally thank Kudeta for such a memorable evening. The food might not have been ALL that, but the live DJ was definitely someone to hold me back for awhile! I would highly recommend this place to all if you truly enjoy an all round experience!Marjorie W.United Kingdo

My friends and I went to Ku de ta restaurant for a brunch this afternoon (7th Dec 2014). When the waitress served one of the drink and I immediately noticed there was a HAIR on the top of the drink and requested to change it.  I have requested to talk to restaurant manager with regards to the quality and service of the restaurant but guest service executive, Mr. Leo came to us and listened to our feedback instead of restaurant manager Mr. Sasi. After that, we saw Mr. Leo and Mr. Sasi talked to each other's. However, throughout the brunch, Mr. Sasi walked around inside and outside of the restaurant except the corner around my table. Obviously, it was not fully booked this afternoon but Mr. Sasi did not come to us to care what was our concern to talk to him as a restaurant manager. We did not eat much of the food because we cannot trust their hygiene on preparing food and drinks. Restaurant manager doesn't even bother the hygiene issue, what about the kitchen crews? This comment could be not fair to the kitchen crews but if the management can accept such restaurant manager, then what about the kitchen crew?Mr. Leo offered complimentary dessert for us, we rejected his kindness. The restaurant manager didn't even approach us to understand or to listen to our feedback throughout the brunch. Having to say that, any complaints, guest service executives have to solve it themselves and even the manager knows something wrong in the restaurant,the restaurant manager still can pretend nothing happens in the restaurant and he does not even come to guest to apologize on that.By offering complimentary things did not impress us or solve the issue occurred in the restaurant especially hygiene issue but it totally spoilt our mood on receiving such bad services and the worst restaurant manager we ever saw. We can only see him giving instructions and listening to guest service executive and waiter to feedback him as well as walking around.The worst thing was when we walked out from the restaurant just right in front of Mr. Sasi, he kept silence even he was standing there and doing nothing. Seriously, it is totally worth for 0 star rating for this restaurant to have such restaurant manager

Had drinks and dinner on a Saturday night. Excellent food, top service. Reservation is a must if you want a table outside (inside is nice but defeats the purpose of being on the 57th floor). All dishes are for sharing, which we loved. Price on the (very) high side.My 2cts piece of advice, the view is at its best at sunset, around 7pm. Enjoy!
2
Diners are basically paying for the view here. The food is very average and small in servings. The service crew don't know the menu and can't understand Singlish. Honestly felt short-changed when the bill came
5
Aishah & izzy both super service staff from Kudeta club side . Their willingness to serve and is helpful with a great smile all nite. Commendatble

Amazing view and great cocktails from the Ku De Ta restaurant - make the effort to visit this lovely restaurant in the most amazing location - stunning views - take your camera

While in Singapore for a business trip a group of six of us went to KuDeTa for dinner. It is a wonderful location on top of the Marina Sands Bay towers. But you can't get to the city side of the rooftop because they have it reserved for hotel quest and people that pay extra. We spent $800+ for dinner and they don't let you on the whole deck, what the heck. The second negative is they tell you you have 15 minutes to show up for your reservation and after that they will give it away. The time push goes on at the end of the dinner as well. If you are not out in two hours they tell you what time you have to be gone because they have your table reserved. We had a 6:15 reservation and had to be out at 8:45 so the dessert seemed to be rushed as the waiter keep clearing plates. Again $800+ for dinner and they rush you out, not the best experience. The food was wonderful. I had the flounder and it melted in your mouth, very tender. Most tender, but cooked flounder I have ever had. Also had the Salmon tempera sushi and the broccoli both which were very good. They serve small dishes and expect you to share, which we did some but not a lot. Had the chocolate ice cream for desert, tasted like old homemade ice cream. The lava cake was wonderful as well. The minimum spend per person is S $80. They have a tasting for $168 per person with another $108 for wine. (if wanted
5
It was a pleasant experience dining in KuDeTa with my best friend celebrating our birthday! Waiter Patrick was rather attentive and we got our complimentary birthday cake without even requesting it all Thanks to him! Wonderful experience and great atmosphere! Be sure to book in advance as u won't want to join the queue it was crazily long!
3
Go at your peril. I know as a tourist, you do probably need to visit but the drinks are extremely expensive & its almost impossible to get to the front of the bar area to have a look at the view.In my opinion, there are better places to see Marina Bay from
4
Nowhere in the world can offer you such a wonderful view whilst eating! Truly wonderful.. I have eaten here a couple of times, first time I had mainly seafood which was good and also fairly priced for the location Sing $180for two including a couple of cocktails each. What I did dislike is that they offer you water then charge you Sing £12, I know it's common practise in some places but really devalues the service experience. Second time I went we ordered mainly meat I thought this was below average, aside from the pork main so I strongly advise eating anything in other than fish

I was in Singapore for one night only, so I decided to treat myself to dinner at Ku De Ta on the 57th Floor of the spectacular Marina Bay Sands Hotel. This hotel is a visual icon of Singapore and is known for it's roof-top infinity pool. I thought I would get an amazing meal and an amazing view. Unfortunately I was disappointed on both accounts. Not completely horrified, but disappointed.First you should know that there are two parts to Ku De Ta - the bar/lounge and the restaurant. Oddly enough, the only part from which you can get a partial view of the infinity pool is the bar. If you dine at the restaurant it is in the center of the roof towards the opposite end from the pool, so the pillars of the restaurant walls and the walkways for those going to the bar or the hotel guest viewing areas keep you well away from the view of the city and afford no view of the pool at all. There are some tables outside near the edge, but they are for four so dining solo there was no way I was getting one of those.Let's talk about the meal. There is a minimum, $80 per person spend, but I expected that in a place of this sort and it isn't hard to hit that number. My issues were the service and the food - nothing much! The service was very nice and well-meaning, but a bit inept. I asked the waiter to explain to me what "obha leaf" was. He said it was a "Japanese leaf", but I could have figured that out from the name. I ask, "yes, but what actually is it?" He didn't really answer me and then went away. I saw him talking to the manager, then he served another table some beverages and when he finally got back to me, he did not come armed with an answer, but rather asked if I were ready to order! They had a number of Wagyu items on a special menu, but they said that the "entrée" items where really all starter sized. I had already settled on the duck for my main, so I didn't want to meats. I ended up with the "mizuna salad" with dried miso, truffle oil, yuzu, and roasted shallots. It was OK. In the end I found it to be a bit one-note - sort of ordinary. For my main I had the "Roast Duck" with corn, asparagus, and orange miso. The duck itself was very good, if slightly overcooked. The sauce for the duck was wonderful and I had them bring me extra so I didn't have to ration, but the vegetables were very strange. The asparagus was mostly bok choy with a little asparagus, even though the menu doesn't say anything about bok choy. And the "corn" was deeply weird. I love corn, but this was as if the chef had sliced up part of an ear of corn on the cob, keeping the kernels on a small wedge of the cob to keep the shape. These sections were then battered and made a bit crisp. The taste was just fine, but how to eat it was the problem. You can't eat the cob an with the wimpy knife provided you couldn't really cut it off the cob either! In the end I resorted to picking up each wedge and biting off the kernels. Weird!The chocolate fondant dessert was fine for me, as I'm a chocoholic. No harm, no foul. The manager was nice and the other servers were nice too, but service timing was inconsistent and vague - the way you sometimes get in the UK when the waiters make what they make, so...To see what all the fuss was about, I walked over to the other side and caught a glimpse of the pool, and with effort I was able to find a few other spots to view the city lights. But for over $100 in dinner, I would have liked an easier time of it. I do respect that the hotel ensures that some things are only available to guests, but there should be better options for restaurant diners.In the end the last blow was losing my credit card. I used my airline card for the first time on the trip at Ku De Ta, but I realized when I got back to the hotel that I didn't have it. I don't think it was necessarily their fault, but calling to advise them of the lost card was a nightmare as the connections were bad and I don't think the person at the other end really understood the issue. Sigh.To sum up, average food for the price, no easy way to enjoy the view and average service
4
we went to celebrate a birthday while on a 5 day "fling" in Singapore.the setting is awesome with stupendous views. BUT...the dishes come out willy-nilly as the kitchen get them ready,odd ! All the servings seem to be by way of 3 pcs- which is awkward if sharing by 4. long drawnout waits, no wines under $145. BUT.. the service was great. BUT... at S $420 per couple it was super expensive and the experience was great , the food was good but not great
4
At first, I was breathtaking by the significant city view. You'll never know Singapore completely if you dont see it from such a great height! I was there when the sun was going down, therefore, it was really lucky for me to enjoy the change from day-look to night-look of the city. Then I was impressive by Sly - a very friendly bartender of the rooftop bar, by his professional bartending skill and his warm welcome. He was surprised us by his special drink called "Singapore Sling" which was really amazing!Woah, definitely worth visiting the place, guess that I will come back again soon
2
What a disappointment. I'm pretty sure half of the dinners (myself included) thought they could enjoy a nice lunch and the view. Well let's be clear, you do NOT get access to the skypark. That would be fair if they would tell you at the reception downstairs (where I specifically asked) but they don't (and convenient avoid answering) and give you a few pieces of paper where, on one, is indeed written you do not have access. The restaurant is stylish, the service efficient but the food (Asian fusion or something like that) is simply tasteless or oily. I chose the brunch, so I was able to sample a great variety of dishes and really you're better off paying for the skypark and going to the restaurant in the nearby mall.
4
A stunning view of the city and great cocktails. Not surprisingly the cocktails were expensive and the bar area was cramped with no seating. Great to try once for the view but there are better bars around.
3
May who served us is very friendly and attentive. Able to offer good advise on dishes recommendations. However, prices bit pricey for the food but ambience was great!
5
the palce the ambience is just superb at the bar and the club at ku de ta bayfront on the 57th floor to top it all NITHI was an excellent host and his creation the Geisha is a must have ... cheers
2
Went there a few years ago and it was a lovely cocktail bar. Nowadays it very regulated, you have to make reservations for almost anything. The staf wasn't very friendly and a bit hasty except for the bartenders who seemed to be having a good time. I would recommend making a reservation for the Club lounge for the loungy-feeling instead of the restaurant/bar. The cocktails were delicious and the views still amazing!You have to buy a ticket to visit the skypark even though you're paying even more when you've had a couple of drinks in the restaurant/bar. It's ridiculous that after drinks you can not visit the level directly beneath the upper level. It's stil nice for drinks and the beautiful view but don't expect to much. Would recommend some other bars in the area with an evenly nice view but a much nicer staf and atmosphere
4
Excellent view of the city when you dine at the place. An expensive restaurant and thus be willing to fork out more.The food is served fresh and it's western style. The dressing is more towards semi formal and thus do not dress sloppy if possible in case they do not allow you to enter. You may check out their online menu what to eat before you place your reservation
2
When I arrived to the restaurant, the first thing that a heard was, "you have to spend at least 80,00++ each per person". I felt this words extremely rude, but I agreed with it. The service was very slow. When I received the menu the waiter said that I needed to choose quickly because the kichen would be close. I ordered my food and beer. The beer was hot and the food was not good not bad, but the price was very high. It was my first and last time there
4
On my first approach I was told that there was no seating available after a 12hour flight. I was then informed that we had to pay 80 dollars a head to make use of the empty tables. I was very unhappy until later in the night when the manager nithi came on shift. He made the evening wonderful and is the most attentive and respecting member of staff I have come across. Kudos to the hospitality. Nithi was the saving grace. I hope he gets the promotion he deserves.
5
ku de ta by day and ku de ta by night! One cannot get enough of this unending amazing roof top space! It has the coolest infinity pool, the amazing dining space for brunches and dinners, a viewing deck ( requires a ticket to be purchased) and the hippest lounge club for a perfect night out
3
Fantastic location with breathtaking views. Suggest it is somewhere you go at least once if nothing else to see what the fuss is about. Small servings expensively priced. Many items marinated or prepared in advance so could not be modified to deal with my affliction. Little to choose in the way of GF options. Expensive wine list with Sangria being about the only reasonably priced option
5
Came to Ku De Ta in 2012 and had an amazing dining experience. Came back again while I was in Singapore for a musical show in MBS. Note: You must make reservation at least a day before. We had our hotel made the reservation for us. We arrived at the restaurant and was given the option for either indoor or the terrace. Of course, we chose the terrace, so we can enjoy the sunset backdrop against Singapore skyline while enjoying our dinner. We had PJ as our server, and she was very friendly and helpful explaining the menu and even sharing her experience and thoughts, giving us suggestions. PJ reminded us that the Ku De Ta food are served for sharing. And she was very honest to let us know when we over ordered (which was very nice and appreciated). We ordered salmon sashimi and pork belly lollipop as starters. The sashimi was average, not the best I had, but it was complimented by rocket salad which was very refreshing. The pork belly lollipop is perfect! The perfect balance of fat to meat, grilled in a semi sweet teriyaki sauce. For mains, we ordered the wagyu sampler (new on the menu) and the tune steak. The wagyu sampler was good. It came with a wagyu skewer, wagyu fillet and seared scallop. The scallop was a tad cold when it was served (I prefer it served hot). The wagyu was good, perfect marbling. I just prefer it without the teriyaki sauce, so I suggested to PJ to maybe consider serving the teriyaki sauce at the side maybe?Drinks - always order the sangria!! First time I went up the Sky Park (did not dine at Ku De Ta), we ordered the red sangria and immediately fell in love with it. Then, my first visit to Ku De Ta, we ordered the champagne sangria and again wanted more! This time, we ordered the white sangria and loved it more and more!! =pFor desserts, we weren't sure what to order. We were already quite full but still want something sweet and not too heavy. PJ suggested the 75% dark chocolate fondant. I was hesitant at first, worrying it may be overly sweet and too filling. PJ insisted and we were glad she did!! We had the best chocolate fondant ever! Warm and gooey in the inside, perfect balance of sweetness, it was served with 5 spice vanilla ice cream and (Godness, the..) berries compote! There couldn't have been any other dessert to perfectly sum up our amazing dining experience
5
I have been to Ku de ta a few times and love chilling out there. It's a great place to just sit back, have a few cocktails and snacks while admiring the view of Singapore from such a great height. Great drinks and snacks!
4
You have to be here for the view.
Food is of good quality but not really special. Dishes are shared with people around the table.
5
Amazing view, amazing food & drinks and amazing staff & crew! I will definitely go back their everytime I visit Singapore!
5
Excellent food, service, and views. Ken was our waiter and was very helpful and attentive! Would highly recommend as a must visit whilst in Singapore.

If you go for the view and the food and atmosphere of the name sake restaurant in Bali you might be disappointed - we were. The restaurant is nothing to do with the "original" in Bali and the food and atmosphere feel short of our experience there. Our view was non-existent. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant ( with over 50% of the patrons) with no real view. We didn't have access to viewing decks or window/deck areas of the restaurant. The restaurant was busy and noisy. The service was efficient, not particularly friendly but fine. The food and drinks came out fast so there no problem being out before your assigned 2 hours. The food was shared plates and the menu offered good variety. We had 4 courses including the Wagyu Beef. I had a beer, my wife a Mojito cocktail. She couldn't drink their take on a Mojito - a bad choice. The Wagyu Beef was high quality and tasty but over seasoned spoiling the sensational flavour of the beef. The greens were also overseasoned - much too salty. The other courses were fine. Our bill was $350 for 2, the beef was $120++. Overall the meal was slightly expensive but not dramatically overpriced. If you want the view go up for just a drink or pay for the viewing platform. The food is Ok but not wonderful. Overall a disappointment but only because we had too high expectations based on our experiences in Bali.
5
I was very delighted when my daughter, Amanda arranged and brought us (family) over for dinner and to celebrate my birthday as well! Excellent service from all her colleagues especially Ivo and Akbar. Very thankful to Ivo that gave me a surprise birthday cake :) As for the skybar, we have got good recommendations from Nithi
5
Having heard of the enormous reputation of the Ku De Ta restaurants, we booked a table for lunch while visiting the Marina Bay Hotel SkyPark. The modernist Japanese inspired ambience is superb with windows surrounding the seating area. The service was precise, friendly and informative. The menu is fresh and innovative. The pace was right and the food presentation photogenic. The food textures and tastes were, as anticipated, also delicious from appetisers to dessert. A really great way to spend a few hours away from the outside heat and humidity. Ku De Ta Singapore deserves its evident popularity and reputation. Highly recommended

My boyfriend and I decided to have dinner in their restaurant last night to celebrate his birthday,we had reservations at 8:15 but we came in around 20 minutes earlierThe staff said we could go up already since the table is now ready! So Yes Its Good start since we dont have to wait!When we arrived at the restaurant, the receptionist has advised that our table is located outside near the panoramic view as per my request so i was really happy we could get to enjoy the scenery!I reminded them to put a happy birthday sign to the dessert and they told me it has been taken care of! AWESOME!For starters, We ordered Salmon Sashimi and the flavor is very tasty you would not need a soy sauce.Then we had the crispy sticky baby squid and its really delicious!I was advised by PJ who served us last night that this dish in the menu has been there since day 1 and they never replace it because its one of their best sellers!Next we had their Fried Prawns, the spicy lemon dressing is really gooood!For the Main course, we had US prime ‘brandt beef’ ribeye, serously! i cant get enough of its goma dressing!! We paired it with their wok fried broccolini and its a good combination.The dessert came with the happy birthday sign and we enjoyed the night with our glass of red wine!!Im very thankful for PJ and Alex who ensured that our stay is really comfortableThis experience wont be perfect without their Splendid serviceIm grateful for PJ who always checks on us,taking our photos,answering all my query with their food,she even gave me a handbag hook and a scarf as a complimentary since she noticed im feeling cold,and the best part is they did not charge us with the dessert! Its on the house! Wow i could not ask for more!Im definitely going back here and recommend this place to my friends!Thank you KU DE'TA for the wonderful evening!:

Make sure you don't pay the 20$ Fee to visit the 56th floor. Go to the bar on the 57th floor for free and buy a drink. It is a much better option with great service and the opportunity to wander around and see the fabulous infinity pool that over looks Singapore. Remember to take photos of the people I. The pool taking photos of themselves especially ones with the extendible selfie sticks. Great atmosphere and service
4
This place is worth a visit for the view and ambience alone. Like many modern cities, the night view of all the buildings is beautiful and in Singapore, where the humidity can be pretty intense even into the evening, this location offers a lovely breeze at the top. The food wasn't bad. It was tasty and well presented. It just didn't knock my socks off and for the price and the exclusivity of the location, I had expected it to. So, you'll probably eat better Japanese food but Ku De Ta is worth a visit just for the location
4
I know the Kudeta Restaurant because I was in Bali, but this one in addition to the delicious food has also an unique view, and if you have the opportunity to be there during the F1 weekend is like you feel a King.
4
If you want to capture the best view of Singapore...this is the place to go. Their chilled margarita is really good! Be ready to join the crowd though as it is a popular place to hang out.
5
The food was simply amazing.We went there with my husband on our 3rd anniversary and we were so happy about our choice. Apart from the amazing staff and views the food was unbelievable. Neither me or my husband were too fond of sushi, but since we were in Singapore and in one of the best restaurants in the world, we decided to give it another try. We were stunned! It was one of the best dishes we have ever tried in our lives and it completely changes our views on sushi. We also tried the duck and the salmon on charcoal as main courses and we cant decide which one was the best. At the end of the meal they brought us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary, which was really sweet of them. All in all it was an amazing experience eating at KUDETA and it was worth every penny. Being a foody, i was very appreciative of the materials used and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a culinary experience and has some money to spend. Yes its not for every pocket, but its definitely worth saving for a special day! Thank you KUDETA for an incredible dinner and our humble congratulations to the chef!

The restaurant is located at the top floor with excellent view.The food was excellent, but it lacked style in presentation on the plate.The wines we tasted were very good.On the negative side was the menu, the dishes were international and the sea food was what you would get in northern Europe.The wine list was essentially limit to one producer for a particular grape
2
Comparing to ku de ta Bali the friendliness and attentiveness of the services is not the same at all The view is outstanding tho I payed and didn't get the change back . Manager didn't show up and no one took my mobile number to solve ...Just go there for the sunset

Ok... This is a hard one to review. Of course the view is the real reason to go here. It is simply spectacular. Being here is more than half the story. the experience is spectacular. The food is good - but not outstanding. and at that price this can be a little painful. their wine list is long, and can be intimidating since the rpices climb fast... this however is a list where it is ok to order from the low end on the price scale... There is a lot of good wine in all price ranges here (given you will pay a premium to dine with one of the best views in Asia

We made a reservation to bring my colleagues from Indonesia, Thailand, US and India to experience dining at the Sky Park. Reservation is a must and you need to queue up at the guest desk at Tower 3 and be allow up the lift. At our table, we were made to feel welcome by Rita, the waitress who was serving us. She really made us feel at home and was attentive, friendly to recommend dishes (some were her favorite) and we can see why after we ate them. The view and atmosphere on Sky Park was fabulous and everyone had a great time. It is a great experience to wine and dine under the skies and my colleagues left with a great memories of the time we spend here. There is a minimum spending of $80++ per person when you dine in and they informed you in advance

My visit to Ku De Ta for the first time is totally worth it. Very good service from drinks server Cherry. Very friendly bubbly and helpful lady. Very understanding and attend to our needs even when not prompted. Food was delicious and chips was spicy but addictive in a way. Drinks are served very quickly. Though it rained and it was cramped i still enjoyed myself
4
We were recommended to visit Ku De Ta for lunch & to enjoy the view. We had a great experience, loved the views, the cocktails & the fabulous bento boxes. If we'd had more time in Singapore we would like to return in the dark to see the place all lit up
4
Ku De Ta has a strong Asian menu but with a flair of fusion cuisine. The restaurant offers the best possible view of Singapore being located at the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Guests enjoy the view without having to pay to go up or enduring the long lines to the top, but reservations are absolutely essential. The prices are a bit steep but it's reasonable with the commanding view, great bar atmosphere outside and an exclusive club on top of the city. A must for tourists
4
Expensive drinks but fantastic views. No cover charge if you go in before 9 PM. Did not get anything to eat. Primarily went there to check out the views.
4
We went to Kudeta for my daughter's 20th birthday dinner. We had a wonderful dinner, sharing loads of Asian dishes, kind of tapas style. Great drinks and fabulous views to enjoy. Not economical, but you expect to pay at the top of a hotel in a great location
4
Great experience. Very good Asian, high quality sushi, very good fish. The cod can be recommended. Try to book a table outside. Fantastic view. A must for tourists, but also for party goers because it's a very good club on the other side of the restaurant as well
4
Ok, so the food is nothing to text home about. But the panorama! You're basically about 60 floors up in the sky sitting in what looks like a flying ship from below. One of the truly iconic buildings in the Far East. It's a world of ex-pats, bankers, traders, celebrities, wannabe celebrities, high flying gamblers, and a few gawkers. It's great fun for an evening of drinks and bar food with friends or colleagues. You wont tire of the views and people watching
5
Whats in a name? - Well, in a place like Ku De Ta, I would say everything! You cannot go wrong by choosing to come here. However little time you have, this place is a Must Do. Singapore looks the best from here, your vacation will feel the best when you're here! Do book well in advance, cos nobody wants to miss out on this one!
4
I guess we could compare the Ku De Ta of Singapore to a trendy spot as the Costes in Paris but in the sky (57th floor)It's always packed with a crowd of expats, tourists, party goers and serious business men who take their clients for a treat in a nice place.The food is decent and you find all the european cuisine classics.Service could be improved on the swiftness but it remains good.A good spot to enjoy the view of Singapore and a pleasant evening from Restaurant to Bar / Club in the same location
4
The bottom line: Yeah - the food is special but please drop the attitude.The occasion was a farewell dinner with very close friends who we see far to infrequently. The venue and the food lived up the occasion. I'm slightly biased as by chocolate desert was better than the choices made by my fellow diners. All-in-all, very, very good food.The down side was the service:- It was made clear to us from the onset that we were expected to be done in 2 hours.- When it came to leaving though no waiters could be found so we enjoyed the extra 45 minutes about which no one seemed to care.- I've just dropped over $500 on a meal yet you still won't let anyone onto your precious observation deck for 1 minute to take a picture. C'mon
3
Booked before arriving in this city,as others said to go,though mainly for the views- those we're restricted as owners of restaurant not the same as those selling quick trips in lift just to look,so despite our food bill of over 200 dollars,we were denied access to the best viewing positions.Despite it's rep and pricing (outrageous) you'd never see famous folk here; too busy,too fussy and what we ordered was tasteless. You are given good but impersonal service,the 1st statement from your waiter saying that they want the table back in 2 hours- we didn't wait that long - luckily a cabbie led us to a street 10 minutes away,full of buzz and a good range of bars and restaurants,where we met local expats and had a ball until closing time at a quarter of what we'd spent in this restaurant. Would someone please give it the Coup d'Etat
4
You go up to the 57th floor of the marina bay sands for the view, but the cordial and group atmosphere of KU de ta makes the view almost secondary. The other guests from around the world love chatting and Ben an the staff behind the bar make sure their guests have their libations quickly and well prepared. The way that they ensure they know your tab (with wrist band numbers) was a neat way to give a customer in a crowded place some comfort that they would accurately charge and you would remember your tab.Overall it was a great way to end a trip to Singapore.
3
Brought guests to the restaurant with lots of expectation n anticipation after hearing so much about this place. First of all the scenery is breathtaking from there, no question about that. Panoramic view of the city landscape but also view of the sea. Was quite annoyed by restriction imposed on the time. Only allowed 2 hours for meals. We wanted to have drinks before that at the bar but our server was very hesitant and kept reminding us on the time (at least 4 times). Maybe the restaurant was full and hence the serving staff were too busy but definitely the service is not what I would expect from such a restaurant.Food wise not bad but considering the price it's within expectations. Recommend to go when the restaurant is not so full.
4
Very interesting fusion menu and excellent quality.
The view has to be seen to be appreciated, amazing.
-----------------------------------------------

Gool location to impress on the top of Marina Bay Hotel. Food is kind of allright, not memorable. Bar is next door. No short after 6:00PM (dress smart).
5
Went there together with a group of my colleagues for the first time and all of us had a wonderful evening as we were firstly amazed by the view at the 57th floor. Overall the food was not bad although its a little expensive. Was served by a staff named Amanda and she took care of us well :)
5
A simple, elegant, and cozy type of restaurant that's perfect to spend the night with your love one. Me and my fiance had a great time celebrating our 3rd anniversary and when the crew learned that it is our special day, they gave as a complimentary treat. Shout out for the great service from Patrick and Maurice. We had a fabulous night because they helped us find the perfect spot to dine. Will surely be back again

This rooftop restaurant sits above the viewing deck at Marina Bay Sands. The restaurant is partly open air. Food and service were excellent. The dishes are asian style and designed for sharing so don't restrict yourself to just a couple of mains. There is a minimum spend of $80pp but this is easily achieved especially if you buy drinks as well.Out the front of the restaurant is an open air bar which has great views although I do not recommend visiting if it is raining as you will not see much. Drinks are expensive but that is the case everywhere in Singapore.My only complaint about this venue is that the ground floor entry is shared with entry to the bar and also the viewing deck, which means you may have to queue with deck visitors even if you have a reservation. Access to the viewing deck, bar and restaurant once you get to the rooftop are also near each other which is confusing.When we did get to the top we were early for our booking and were sent out to the bar for drinks first, which was fine, but when we attempted to go to the bar again after our meal for further drinks they didn't want to let us in and we had to explain at entry that we had just come from the restaurant. There is a dress code after 6pm for both the bar and restaurant but this doesn't seem to be enforced at ground level. Women in the lift with us were in shorts and were allowed up to the bar but then denied entry.Compared to other rooftop restaurants we visited while in Singapore, Ku De Ta seemed good value
5
i really like how manager fabio and his team went the distance to ensure our anniversary was enjoyable one. Phenomenal view coupled with excellent service makes the good food taste even better. The staff attended to our many requests with a smile on their faces and we left kudeta with one on ours
5
we dined at ku de ta on the recommendation of Singapore based friends. it was in celebration of our 21st wedding anniversary. The staff were extremely helpful in assisting us with gluten free options on their wonderful menu. I make particular mention of Marycel, who was extremely pleasant and helpful with our selections. For a special night out, this comes with high praise
5
We had diner (please make reservations) on the outside terrace, dinner with a view ... expensive, something you only do once ... you have to spend a minimum of S$80,- p.p ... Keith and Faisal were our wonderful hosts / waiters ... great food, desert was very yummie ... Keith advised us to order different meals, so we could share, the chef would anticipate on that, so we shared and made our own surf and turf ... desert was each their own, to yummie to share mine :D ... thanks Keith and Faisal for a wonderful evening ..
5
We spent our last night here, and I must say it a great place to end any trip. We could see entire Singapore city from there. The music and environment is really refreshing.Go there if you are really want to spent a lavish evening in style.I found it better than going to Sky lounge in the same tower
3
A visiting friend and I went to Ku De Ta for drinks fairly late on a Saturday night. As everyone else says, the views and engineering marvel of the entire Marina Bay Sands sky deck is awesome. Really, you probably want to visit at least once.Now, as far as a bar goes, it was crap. Fairly crowded around the circular bar, suuuuuper slow service (I waited 15 minutes to get served and a further 10 minutes waiting for them to process my credit card), and quite prices drinks (two cocktails were around SGD 65). So, as a bar experience goes, it was sorely lacking. In fact, if I were ranking Ku De Ta on its merits as a bar alone, I'd probably give it 1 out of 5...But, again, you don't really go here for an amazing bar experience....you go here to see the sight. And since it IS an amazing sights, I have to revise my rating to a 3 out of 5.I will probably go back next time someone visits, but certainly will not be baking Ku De Ta my regular
4
Friends and I went for drinks multiple times. The atmosphere was very chill. It takes a while to order your drinks. The music was good. Overall, it's a very nice place to chill with friends if your prepared to pay $40+ to get in.
5
this restaurant is at the top floor of Marina bay sands. you get great sea food here. you can sit besides the pool, relax and enjoy your food and drinks from Ku De Ta.
5
We loved everything about this restaurant. The food was amazing and the service was excellent. It is $$$ but totally worth it.
4
My first time eating at the restaurant. Service was great. You instantly know this is a different type of restaurant especially if you have made a reservation (which I did). You were escorted to the chair and everything is ready for you to order. Menu on the table, cutlery spread, napkins etc..We ordered very quickly and the food took no more than 15 minutes to arrive. On the menu was rack of lamb, salmon, steamed cod and slices of seared beef. We topped it off with red house wine (a Pinot) and the house champagne. Just what the occasion called for.We did expect a hit on the wallet but I had the same feeling when I was in cape Town, Seattle, San Francisco, Sydney, Auckland, Vancouver etc..If you had to be at an iconic restaurant you would expect to pay. Enjoy the view! and the food
4
Definitely a cool/very trendy place with spectacular setting at the top of the Marina Bay hotel (57th floor) with spectacular views of Singapore. Food is good (Japanese/Asian Fusion) but expensive for what you get (you pay for location and trendiness factor). One thing however… after dinner I was having an after-dinner drink at the bar and watched a bartender take 3 used beer glasses, empty them and barely rinse them before using them to serve beer for other guests… No soap! No scrubbing! I expect my glasses to be washed with soap at any establishment, let alone one where drinks will run you $20+…
3
We visited the Ku De Ta Club Lounge in the afternoon after walking around the harbor area. The lounge it self has a great 360 degree view of the harbor and the Singapore Straits. I was amazed at the number of cargo ships anchored in the straits waiting to be unloaded. Service was a little slow and the food a little pricey but the view helped make it worthwhile.
5
My husband and I visit Singapore from Manhattan, NY for our vacation. We visited this restaurant, a roof top restaurant located the famous Sands Hotel. Our waitters, Leo (could be a floor manager) & Annie were wonderful, professional and very friendly. It's a long trip from NY to there, but we hope we can visit there again
5
We had a choice of lining up and eventualy paying $20 a head to go up to the club lounge and then pay $20+ for a drink. Instead we booked a table at the ku de ta restaurant and went straight up for free. The catch was we had to spend a minimum of $80 each which we easily did. (Paid $220 for 2). We went to the Club Lounge before and after for very expensive drinks. It rained a little bit and made it hard to enjoy the views. Only go on a night that is not raining.Or you can go to Level 33 bar on Marina Boulevard and go up for free for cheaper beers at their own brewery.
5
Ku de Ta was fabulous! The food and service were fantastic, and the personal attention from Hiro the restaurant manager was second to none! I've been before and it doesn't disappoint the second time round. Catching up with international girlfriends couldn't have been more fun there, and the views as always were fab!Hiro even suggested some great place to go to well into the night.Very happy with the experience, will most certainly be back
3
I went with two friends who live in Singapore to have dinner as they wanted me to see the luxury Singapore offers. Part of the restaurant is great, part of it not so great. For the experience we had it was way too expensive, but had it been perfect it would have been worth every dollar. The good thing is the view which is unbeatable and gives the location a great feel, but the letdown is the service and the food. I mean, the food was good but when I order a $50 steak I expect it to be more than lukewarm, especially when I emphasized that I like it medium rare but HOT. The meat was delicious and tender… but not hot. The service was okay – nothing great, nothing fantastic hence a bit of a disappointment for a place that is supposed to be luxury.Would I go again? Yes, with someone who haven't been so they can see the view, but otherwise not
5
Good food, very very nice staff. Exciting view. Price is oké. Ku De Ta will be in my top 5 list of unforgetable restaurantsites. Great. I will never forget.
4
Service disorganised and at times chaoticLimited opportunity to enjoy the view from the bar - the best viewing areas are reserved for non-restaurant customers.Food excellent. Wine and drinks are very expensive.2 hour limit at the table is enforced. This can make it a bit rushed towards the end of the mea
4
My wife and I booked this restaurant as our final meal in Singapore before jetting off home.We opted for the taster menu which was a good choice. It's $168 per person.You get a beautiful view of the city whilst eating on the rooftop of the hotel.This however can be a negative as people are walking around taking pictures whilst you are having a meal. They allow tourists to pay and use the bar on the roof.This means that it can get busy and slightly detracts from the romantic occasion.The food was very good in my opinion, but I don't think I had a bad meal whilst I was in Singapore. The Sushi course was exquisite.It's was a good evening but some minor things spoilt the ambience of the evening.It was very busy so you have to book in advance
2
The plus: the location on the terrace of the Marina Bay Sands & the name from the original KU DE TA in Bali.The minus: the attitude of Management.Even if you are a hotel guest you can only sit in the tables on terrace when ordering a min order (or a bottle of champagne / alcohol). We wanted to have a drink (we were 4 hotel guests) and as we refused to purchase the bottle we were invited to "stand" at the bar while having almost all tables empty.They explained that they run operations independently from the Marina Bay Sand
5
I wish to commend on the warmth and hospitality experienced from one of your staff Rita. I was there to do a marriage proposal and she did a marvelous job at making the experience for both me and my wife extra special with her great service
5
We only had two days in Singapore. Therefore, we chose to have an extraordinary experience at one of the best restaurants in the city. Food and wines were excellent - and Ara and Charlene did a very good job. Thanks for a great evening! Kasper, Hanne and Jesper Tangbæk, Denmar
5
we booked a meal at Ku de ta to celebrate our 30th aniversary, only to find out later it was the F1 weekend. Even better as my wife and i are both F1 fans. The views from the top of the Marina Bay Sands of the Singapore skyline are superb as was the view of the F1 race track below for the Saturday qualifying sessions. We were made to feel special and welcome right from the start with a fantastic table and the service from the staff was exemplorary. The food and accompanying wine was delivered with pride and each was explained to us in full detail. it tasted fantastic. after finishing the meal we had cocktails and then.... the heavens opened and we were treated to a tropical storm, thunder lightening and Very heavy rain. it was great to observe and the staff worked hard to ensure everybody had a good time. As it was our aniversary, we were well looked afte, as was everyone else, and we look forward to coming again. Thank you for a memorable experience
5
Funny thing that every time we came here, it's a rainy day. Still, the view was breathtaking. The service was exceptional. Our lil one was requesting kids chopsticks and the waiter custom made him a pair as the restaurant only offer one type of chopsticks. When I sneeze, another waiter pass me napkins. They were just very considerate. They offer a handbag butler for the ladies, you can take home after:)Food was great. We ordered a lot from the a la cart menu, taken our waiter's recommendations, they all taste fantastic. Special mention to the apple and honey ice-cream desert
1
While waiting for the lift a young couple were turned away because he was wearing shorts, which is fine as you have a dress code elegant casual but on arriving upstairs and seeing staff / owner walking around in a" I love something T-shirt" (hardly elegant casual ) we should have turned around and left. Our intension was to just have a drink in the outside bar but decided to stay for dinner. We were then told we could not dine outside because the weather might change so we were offered a table inside with no view and we could move outside for dessert which we took .We chose five menu items (tapas share plates) and a bottle of wine, we received four items and had to ask where the fifth item was which we received after an apology from the waiter. We then were asked if we wanted dessert which we said we would if we could have it outside, the waiter went away to check with someone higher up if this was ok and came back with a big NO(he was very apologetic and it was not his fault) so we said no to dessert. your loss. Funny thing is while we were eating our food other people arrived and were allowed to dine outside. After spending nearly three hundred dollars we went outside to take some photos of the view which after all is what we were there to see we were told by some arrogant waiter we weren't allowed to do this because it might upset other guests we did complain to a supervisor on the night but got the impression they didn't care. Note I haven't mentioned the food because its not worth mentioning
5
what a nice eavening !Very friendly staff ( our host was Patrique) but all the others were also very friendly.delicious food and wines. ( a very fine taste ).and as suprice , at the end of our dinner, they presented my husband a birthdaycake ( and we did not told them that it was his birthday !!!).thanks for an unforgetable and romantic evening with the beautiful vieuw over Singapore and their excellent staff and delicious dinner.Ronny and Greet Helleman

One of the best View HotSpots in the world. You have an unbelievable overlook to Singapore and you can enjoy twice! The F&B is also very good and we had also a very good service! Please make a reservation ...
4
Very good restaurant! Excellent food and view from the top of Marina Bay Hotel. A little bit expensive.
5
A really relaxed way to spend a few hours above the Singapore skyline. Great food and an amazing wine list. Reasonably priced.
4
Recommended by a friend who lives in Singapore to check out the view of Singapore. We weren't let down at all. If you feel like clubbing head over to the club like we did. Good fun good music.
5
To Racquel (guest relations mgr)We would like to thank you for letting us have a great time over at Ku Dé Ta when we were in Singapore the last time. You have made us feel very special! We finally have seen the famous Marina Bay Sands iconic pool even if its night already. And we felt we really are special having to try all of Ku Dé Ta's resto, skybar and club all on the same nightWe are now back to our regular lives and are palnning to spend one New Year's eve over at MBS!Again, it was great customer service that had us to fulfill our dream to see the iconic pool on an icon synonymous to Singapore! Wayne and Terr

Truly sumptuous view of the Singapore skyline but a shame that they rope off diners from the best views...wasn't always that way. Guess the revenue miesters found another way of milking a couple more bucks. You need to get a ticket at the basement. Oh well...The restaurant offers a good vibe. A bit too dark...they need to provide you a clip-on light to read the menu...but pretty cool. The bar is hopping and great for hanging out.The food is some sort of nouveau japanese. Interesting mix of ingredients and flavors. Not for the purists. Portions are just right and good for sharing for 2-3 people. The foie gras, fatty blue fin, oysters, beef "sashimi"(?) hit all the high notes.Thumbs down on the tempura...soggy and just too much batter! AVOID!If you want to make it to the top this is a good place to chill...for two hours! After that You need to "return" your table for the next seating
5
We had a superb experience arriving in daylight at 630pm to see the sun go down and lights of the city come up - what a view! I was advised to book early which we did and our window seat request upheld. We were dining with my 84 year old mother who uses a walking assistance device - the team of staff could not have been more helpful and really made our experience a delight. Thank you to Rita who looked after us at the table. A must do for drinks and magnificent meal while in Singapore.
3
We chose to go here for our 3rd year anniversary several months ago and we were a bit disappointed. The restaurant is very nice with a nice view. And the food was good. The portions was a lot more than I expected. But it was too loud, full of people, and the servers were very inattentive. It took a while for us to get our orders. And once they did, they didn't even let us finish ordering. They walked away without repeating our orders assuming we were done ordering when in fact we still had other things to order. It was a busy night and I understand that. But the service could have been better
4
We had a lovely lunch on top of the world. This is an amazing restaurant on top of Marina Sands Resort in the iconic ship on top of the hotel. Very expensive but hey....view up there is amazing. We had a fixed price sashimi lunch that was quite good. Then enjoyed walking around to photograph Singapore. What a great way to see the city. Highly recommend this restaurant but open your wallet and don't worry about cost.
5
We enjoyed a wonderful evening at Ku De Ta, after the Grand Prix weekend.It was amongst the top ten venues I have ever eaten at, for the view and the cool atmosphere.Amanda and Jen were awesome - their attentiveness was faultless.The table, tucked away but right on the edge, was exactly what we had asked for - perfect!Highly recommended
3
Visited with family for Sunday brunch. Children below 8 is free. It is a semi-buffet with starters and main course serve only once. The dessert is free flow but it is quite a limited range. The oysters served during the starters is not great.
4
when we arrived it was 7PM the view was amazing and mouth dropping, the light was amazing it was like we were flying then came diner it was incredibly tasty and mouth watering after diner we had desert it was good as diner.
4
We had a wonderful dinner here while in Sinapore in October. The food was AMAZING - loved everything - and was really nice with small plate for sharing, full of flavour. The staff were great and attentive, only thing was it was quite windy so sitting outside (with the big fans also) was a bit full on. It definitely isn't cheaper with a min spend of $80 per person, but the food and view is worth it in my opinion
4
Arrange by my girlfriend for my birthday. View was astonishing, service was great as a waitress was dedicated to 3 tables in a cluster. Making all requests attended in shortest time. Was served by a waitress named "Rita". She's of great help and service and was another highlight to the evening. Thumbs up.
5
Since we stayed at the MBS, we went up to Ku De Ta at Level 57 to try out the food there. The good thing is that, there is no reservation needed. You can just walk in and choose where you wanna sit. I made a mistake and choose the outdoor tables. It was packed everywhere and we got our table near the speaker (which is too loud for us). The staffs were very helpful. We requested for a change of table. and request to sit inside instead. They agreed and help us to change our table. The staffs were fast and efficient. They will respond to you quickly. The food was fantastic! We tried the smoked salmon, duck, sashimi, soft shells and the prawns. It was fantastic! The food is very pricey and the portion is small. But it's worth trying! Delicious!There is a minimum spend of $80/pax if you're planning to dine in there. And yes! I remember that I got a handbag. The staff offered and attached a hook on the table so that I could hang my handbag without any hassle! Overall.. Food and service is good! I will visit again
3
We managed to get in to Ku de Ta at short notice and get a table 'on the edge' with an amazing (if slightly hazy) view.The food was nice. Fairly imaginative, nicely presented but lacking in flavour. I think the main problem was that we had been to Les Amis the night before and had such a high standard of food that Ku de Ta was a bit of a let down. Also the price for what was essentially a bunch of Tapas was pretty outrageous especially with a decent bottle of wine
5
Had a great meal at Ku De Ta Singapore whilst there for the F1 GP 2014. We were on our last leg of an around the world trip and had had some great meals - this was up there with the best Lunches. The service was great, Rita was very attentive, the wine list extensive, we started with superb Bellinis, then Cloudy Bay (NZ), and you could not fault the Calamari (signature dish). Prices were ok for A La Carte, bit more if you go for Degustation / set food wine menu. The view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands is excellent. Don't know why people pay to go to the top and look around, go and have lunch instead and put the $29.00 toward your meal
4
Cool ambience but then 57 stories up overlooking the harbour and city. Good music vibe and food exciting albeit probably over priced for what it is. Best to book but we managed to get a table inside although this warmed up so book and ask for table outside. They do have big sofas with tables, book one of these for comfort
5
the food here is really expensive but they deserve the price coz the taste, service and ambiance is really worth spending money for...i think the best part of the experience was the service given to us because the waiter even helped us decide which among all those unfamiliar food we can order thus making our experience really enjoyable:)kudos for that:) highly recommended if you have extra money to spend on pricey food
5
Wow, you need a head for heights to head up to the 57th floor of the marina bay sands to this restaurant. But the view is unbelievable and the food matches. We had the most delicious foie gras and soft shell rolls, black cod and beef. Great evening out, very busy, must book and may need to queue for lift up.
5
The view is amazing from this place, you can see the city lights, the beach, airplanes and all of the excitements in Singapore. I also like their sangria, one of the best i ever had
5
Nice stay, thanks Nithi !!!
For delicious cocktails with special flavour who I ever tasted
Warm regards
5
This place has one of the best views in Singapore. For the dine, wine and the party kind, Ku De Ta is a must visit. If you don't, then you wont... Complete your cycle of party hop in Singapore.
5
Ken and Shari were really excellent hosts. Professional and friendly at the same time.
The food was outstanding. Great presentation.
Great location. The views are, of course, spectacular.
5
The food was nice but what we liked the most was the atmosphere -it was full of people but not too flu, the people were relaxed, having their drinks at the bar , chatting and later sitting at their tables. The view is breathtaking-Singapore city is so beautiful
4
Seems to be the 'in place', especially for the young trendies. We really went for the views and to experience what other people (a lot younger than us) were raving about. I have to say that I found it quite average, with the exception of the views! The service was okay but not special, but around the bar area is severely cramped. I do recommend a visit though - if only for the experience. One good thing - the staff are quite particular about the standards of dress - which can only be a plus
4
This is the most stunning location ever experienced for dining or just drinking. The food was good, not cheap by any stretch, but worth it for a special occasion. We did receive very good service from Rita and Fabio, including special deserts for the "birthday boys". Book early for an outside table, make it clear that's what you want and don't be fobbed off if they try to put you on an inner table

This is my fourth visit to Kudeta in Singapore and as usual it was average. The staff here really don't give a toss about customers . They definitely have an attitude from the moment you walk in in this place. And this has happened since my first visit when it first opened. I honestly think unless you are "someone" in Singapore you are just an annoyance to them. Food is mediocre to say the least and a limited cocktail list with warm drinks that need more ice! Nothing at all like its amazing namesake in Bali !!

Partner made reservations for the evening to celebrate our anniversary. Slight hiccup at L1 when they couldn't find his reservations. Thankfully, they sent an email confirmation on the reservation earlier in the day and soon we were on our way to L57!Food: We ordered the foie gras and soft shell crab for starters. Both were yummy except the soft shell crab got slightly fishy towards the end. Still yummy though :) Next, we had the pork cheeks, teriyaki chicken, mushrooms and fried rice for the mains. The pork cheeks was the highlight of the evening! Great portion and extremely yummy. Dessert was good too; the white chocolate panna cotta was TO DIE FOR! We considered asking if it was possible to order just the panna cotta alone (with a scope of raspberry ice cream) but ultimately we went without it because we were so full.Drinks: I had geisha's kiss and eastern spice. Geisha's kiss was very very good. This is something I will definitely order again. Extremely refreshing. Eastern spice on the other, not too good. I didn't finish it. Hmmm I probably won't order this again. Partner had the hoegarden rosse (?), very sweet and light. Yummy!Service: Service was great! I had Rita to thank for all of the wonderful recommendations she gave to us. (It was her idea to try the Geisha's kiss and dessert.) Plus she was extremely helpful and attentive without being intrusive. At one point, she also helped us take many pictures at different angles. It's not everyday you meet somebody who makes u feel genuinely cared about as a customer. Thanks Rita! :)Ambience: I can see why this place is so raved about. Being on the 57th floor, it gives you a lovely view of Singapore. You can see the Singapore flyer, the gardens by the bay, the ships in the water and at one point, we could even see the parkway parade shopping mall logo! There was also a great music selection and they provided reading lights for us to see the menus. Too bad about the haze though but I don't think it affected their business much, the place was still pretty packed

Went to Ku De Ta for weekend brunch for my birthday celebration today. While the view was awesome, the food and incompetency of the staff cannot make up for the view - overall, it was a terrible, unpleasant and unforgettable (ironically in the negative sense) experience. The restaurant did not stipulate that children are not allowed. When our boys were playing in the restaurant, a group of caucasian guests seated 2 tables away told the restaurant supervisor that he did not like his "brunch" to be affected by the children, but the Restaurant Supervisor Shari took no notice of his feedback, and then one of the man came roaring at us at our table, and condescendingly told us off that our boys should not be running around, because he made sure his kids sit at the table while having their meals! He looked drunk (saw some alcohol and the weekend brunch included one with free flow of wine, champagne and beer) and condescendingly told us that he would pay for our bill just so that we get out of the restaurant! He even challenged us to talk outside the restaurant! While we were shocked by the man's behavior, we were even more shocked that none of the service staff took any action to control or stop the man from the commotion at our table!! The staff only called in their Restaurant Manager Sasi upon our request, but all he did was just trying to pacify us by saying thAt the meal will be on him (just because we are Asians?). He did not go back to the Caucasian guest to tell him to stop his unruly behavior, which gives us the perception that he condoned the behavior of the caucasian. We paid for our meal and did not accept the complementary from Sasi because we felt that the restaurant staff did not handle the incident professionally and competently, especially the supervisor Shari and Restaurant Manager Sasi. It really left a bad taste and experience of MBS amongst us. As for the food for the weekend brunch, the appetizers were nothing exotic, and the main courses were carbo-loaded. Honestly, you can get better quality of the ramen, chicken katsudon and Danburi from the mid-range japanese restaurants. The dessert table was also nothing to rave about. So if you really want to go up to the Sky Park, just buy a $23 ticket and save your money as the experience, service and food are just not worth it. If you really want to have the view at a restaurant or bar, go to Level 33 at Marina Bay Financial Bay Tower. The view is just as good, and food is better

Fantastic meal in wonderful surroundings - thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. Staff we're politely attentive and created a relaxed environment.
5
Attentive service without being intrusive, superb food and amazing location. I highly recommend it .
4
I had a business dinner there we were a lot but the service was really good and the food exeptional. Worth the visit.
5
+ Perfect location with stunning views
+ Kind and attentive service (thanks to Fabio!)
+ Awesome seafood
+ Delicious cocktails
+ Free entry to the club lounge if you're a guest at thr restaurant (no cover charge)

Had a large business lunch here, approx 12 people. It was fantastic. We had the business lunch menu and it was fabulous. CANNOT say a bad word about this place. Great service, Great Food and Great location.
You MUST COME HERE!!
5
Was there with a couple of friends for dinner, and I must say the view was phenomenal! Great atmosphere in the restaurant, felt very comfortable dining in the restaurant. Not to mention the excellent quality of food and the awesome service from the staffs! Specially mentioning the great service from Amanda. She has been very friendly, kind and very patient in explaining about the menu, and giving us good recommendation of the food. Very pleased to have been served by her! Love the place and will definitely be back! Thumbs up
5
There are three buildings with a "boat" that sits across the top - an architectural marvel. The building is beautiful during the day and at night. Incredible stunning view of the city and port from the rooftop - worth the $25 drinks! No fee to get to the bar, but it limits your rooftop access. Absolutely worth doing
5
we recently in Singapore the 30th and 31th of september 2014 and we went for lunch at ku de ta it was the best lunch we had ever the view was fantastic but what realy made are visit was the five star service we got from all the staff from the minute that we stepped in to the time we left . if you dont go you are missing out on great experianc
4
Had spectacular service at this roof top restaurant. They really look after you. The food is ok as well, but more the kind of things you would expect. The near by night club is splendid, so is the music in the restaurant. If you haven't been there, you want to go
5
I brought my wife to Ku De Ta for her Birthday... first time in Singapore and she fell in love.. the city is beautiful but the people who worked in Ku De Ta named Arlan and Carly completed her most special day... view was amazing.. people were crazy happy with the music and drinks... Alan and Carly... we will be back... not because of the music, view or the alcohol... we we can get that somewhere else... what you have there that makes it special.. the people of Ku De Ta specially Arlan and Carla who made my wofe's special day very memorable.. see you soon guys and more power!!! - The Crazy Happy Couple

The ambience is lovely with a view of Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Flyer. Food is alright. Wednesday is Ladies Nite and gals get free drinks and that's a bonus for us ladies.
3
Had a limited time in Singapore so wanted to eat at a great restaurant, ordered the tasting menu, the food was ok, felt as though they wanted to serve the dishes in a hurry and two or three of the courses came at the same time. Expensive for what it was and not really a fine dining experience. On a plus note the location is amazing! If I visit again I think I would go for drinks and eat elsewhere
5
You might pay a premium price to wine & dine here, but the location is absolutely superb. Where else can you relax outdoors sixty-storeys high on a beautiful balmy evening enjoying magnificent views, with a cool hip dining atmosphere, great music, cocktails, and nice food. Whilst the meal wasn't the best we've had in Singapore and the bill a bit on the pricey side, the location & setting makes this place an absolute must to visit! Book well ahead, request an edge table with views, sit back and enjoy that view
5
My Mum and I recently dined in the Ku De Ta restaurant and what an amazing experience. The views, the food, the service everything was spot on. We sat outside so we could enjoy the views. Afterwards we were taken by one of the staff around to a bar near the pool and watched the laser light show. That was something to see also. Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone
4
View is outstanding. Access to the observation platform was a separate price to dinner guest though which was disappointing. I was treated as a guest to the meal so I can't comment on prices but the meal was good - not overly memorable but quickly served and good. The place is dark so you get a little torch for the menu and it's very popular and busy. The starter came so quick I thought they were trying to flip the tables quickly to get more in but that wasn't the issue - they were just efficient and pleasant. Great staff
2
The view is great but the food doesnt even get close to the standards of the real and original Ku De Ta in Bali which is surprising as one would expect that a restaurant in Singapore would have better sourcing options. It's highly priced fror what it is and was dissapointed with both food and service
4
it's on a pricey side, but the worst part is u don't have access to the entire observ. deck. Food is no bad but nothing great abt it either. mostly this place is known for holding a b'day or wed anv or 1st dat kind of event
4
The food was average to us but our guests loved their Japanese and champagne selection. Atmosphere was wonderful though we found it a bit too dark. We went between 6 to 7 in the evening and there wasn't much lighting on the table. Which made it a bit annoying when trying to talk and the kids trying to keep themselves entertained.
5
This was one of the best experiences on our trip to Singapore. Excellent service, view and food.. The food has a lot of different courses that fits everybody. A great place for a good view, lounge feeling and just a great dinner. Maybe they should combine the package, so that you could go to the viewdeck or maybe even the pool, when you spend a lot of money in the restaurant..

I dined at Kudeta with my partner and it was one of those dinners when we were hoping to just catch up with each other and really have a nice, relaxed meal with a few drinks.Our visit started with the restaurant assigning us a table that we hadnt asked for because a big group had made a reservation on the same day. Fair enough.We started with a few cocktails and seafood starters and some foie gras, which really set the bar high in terms of our expectations.But everything from thereon was downhill. The service, the wrong food that was served to us ans of course the mistake on our billing. I paid close to SGD 300 for the meal (for two) and came out feeling very dissatisfied. The views are obviously spectacular but I'm not sure if I want to pay that kind of money for an average meal with good views.
3
The good part is the great Panaromic views of Singapore iconic skyline.
However, there is little to be mentioned regarding the gastronomic experience. Singapore's Hawker food is of better value than that.
4
Great food and impressive view. A little pricey and disappointing you can't get out to see the entire observation deck. Overall a good experience.
4
The bar was a great experience and the view from the outdoor area was phenomenal. The late night food was limited to bar snacks but was really well done and different - although quite pricey it was justified by the location. It was loud and noisy and full of young people - but that's what we expected
4
I think you go for the view as much as the food. I hadn't heard great reviews but I really liked it. We had a table right on the edge overlooking the sea. Seating 7, so try and book if you can. Good service and I loved the Japanese food with a twist. It's not cheap but I wouldn't expect it to be at the top of one the world's iconic buildings
2
After arriving early to take in the magnificent view we checked in at the restaurant desk to be advised our table was not available but we could have a drink at the bar and they would come and get us when ready. 45 mins later we decided to inquire about our table, only to be advised it had been ready for some time and they were waiting for us. We quickly ordered our meal and some in the group had entrees that were served in a reasonable time, however this is where everything fell apart. When the main course arrived my partner did not receive her main course and while we waited and waited our meals became warm to the point we decided to eat. Finally her meal arrive (25 mins late) after we had all finished our meals and apart from being cold the meat was over-cooked. For a top class restaurant you would expect a lot better. I complained to the head waiter and they offered a free dessert. This was not suitable and we just wanted to leave, so after parting with a large sum of money we left, bitterly disappointed. This really ruined our night out. I have eaten at many fine restaurants and my advice is don't go for the food, the portions are small and overpriced. Just go for the view and have a drin

This restaurant was a great experience as well as a great meal. The view from the outdoor area was phenomenal. Each dish was really well done and special and the service was very attentive and high quality. Although quite pricey (SGD 280.00 for two without wine) we thought it was really quite good value for the location and the quality of the dining experience
5
As a solo traveller, I just wanted to travel to the top of the MBS to check out the view and chill out with a cocktail. That's just what I got. I was expecting the drinks to be pricey, and indeed they were. I paid S$27 for a cocktail, but it was delicious & the view was worth it. I got a table right on the perimeter of the bar that had a full view of 270 degrees (the restaurant building blocks the other quarter). The staff were friendly and efficient, although I did get the feeling they were monitoring me to ensure I hadn't just come up for a free photo session, which I'm sure happens. I will definitely return, maybe to the restaurant next time

We went to Ku Te Da to celebrate my wife's birthday. We were stopping in singapore on our way home to Australia. All the seating is set to take advantage of the view. Our night started off in a torrential downpour (couldn't see a thing) but the staff ,particularly Ivo, and the ambience made it a wonderful evening. The food is sensational, large serves. We ordered 6 dishes for the two of us and there was more food than we could eat .Ivo was terrific.he made us feel like we were the only couple in the restaurant.Don't hesitate to take the experience for visitors to singapore it doesn't get any better.The rain did stop before we finished our meal so we were able to enjoy the fabulous views of Singapore 
4
We have been to Ku de ta on our 1st Anniversary.. I was a little hesitate because of the minimum spend as more or my husband are not heavy eaters but after reaching the place we understood it can easily done and we ended up paying more than the minimum spend as the ddishes where slightly expensive than the usual restaurants.. ment to be as they are giving us a lovely experience of marina bay sands and tge amazing view.. everyone needs to reserve before going to the restaurant.. usually the observation deck is closed for visitors during the day but after we finished our dinner and while leaving around 11.30pm the observation deck was open to restaurant visitors which was nice not sure of that usually is the case, but if it is then its good to go for dinner.. food was not bad decent food..Definitely would recommend to visit for a good special occasion
5
If you are in Singapore this restaurant is a must atop the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, its on the 57th floor the views are to die for, aim to go about 5.30ish and enjoy a cocktail while drinking in the views, the service is 5 star, as is the meal, there is a minimum charge of $80.00 per person which they advise you of but the experience is oh so worth it, and a nice way of having the meal, all dishes are placed in the middle so you can share starters & mains & sides but definatley have your own dessert they are too good to share. As you progress through your meal and the night darkens the lights of Singapore are even more magic
5
Brilliant nighttime views & super service. We loved our meals & our whiskey sour cocktails. Sit on the outdoor terrace & enjoy the panorama of Singapore below you....
5
The place is superb and food at the fine dining is mind blowing. The night club quedeta rocks.
Love to come again and again.
5
Love this place, the restaurant is good, and the nightclub is awesome. The food and service could be better, but the place is amazing.
5
The food is great. The service is exceptional especially our server Leo. He recommended most of what we ate and it was delicious.
5
We saved Marina Bay Sands for the end of our holiday, originally we planned to watch the sun go down from 57 floors with a cocktail in the sky bar but ended up staying for food in the Ku De Ta restaurant too. Soooo glad we did. The food was fantastic - melt in your mouth amazing. Good portions not stupidly priced. The service from all and our waitress Kini was friendly and professional to match and as it was our honeymoon we also got a beautiful little cake, free! Great way to spend an evening. We think this is one of the must do things in Singapore! Pre book your table though (we were lucky to get one) and ask for a table on the edge over looking the harbour so you get the best view
5
What a great experience! The restaurant itself is classy with first class food, the atmosphere and ambience exceptional. The service was terrific. Add to this the stunning views of Singapore.A definite big tick for Ku De Ta and we will return on our next visit to Singapore
4
The restaurant is perched on top of the Sands Hotel in Marina Bay. The view is amazing. Some areas on the panoramic view is reserved for guests and the swimming pool area is also only accessible for guest. The food is good, the service is good and not excessive expensive by Singapore pricing standards. Definitely a must. Make sure to make a reservation during big events.
3
Very nice place and fantastic views but that us it! Kudos to the arquitect thumbs down on service and food... Food ok but nothing close to prices charged and service is very far from what you would expect from a place like this. My advice is make reservations so that you can get in the elevator to the top, walk and see the views, maybe have a drink (expensive but worth the views) and walk away to nice restaurant in town. Very sad that the food and service are not up to what the place deserves.
3
Just been for brunch over the Grand Prix weekend at around £80 each all in with taxes tip etc, was an all inclusive menu, soft drinks, coffee etc...not impressed by still managing to get charged an additional £12 for bottles of water though! Food and service ok
2
We were so excited! Last year we had the best ever brunch at Ke De Ta at Marina Bay Sands. It's pricy at $200 per head but boy was it worth it. NOT THIS YEAR! We were absolutely shocked and so stunningly disappointed to find that the menu had been changed from a comprehensive international al a carte and buffet selection to a small asian infusion menu with very limited drinks. Last year the choice for food and beverages was endless. I feel like we've been ripped off massively as you charged us the exact same price for something so basic, tasteless and with little or no choice. The staff and service were fabulous and i really felt for them having to apologise on management's behalf for putting this substandard menu together. Better food and way better value down at the Food Court in the MBS shopping mall. Won't be visiting again. Such a shame
4
Great food, with a fantastic view over the bay.
Would definitely visit again. At first was sceptical of modern Asian style, but food was good and service impecable
4
Went there with wifey.
A good place to spend chilling time and dinner.
Although the food is par, the view is amazing.
4
The food and drinks were great, the view is beautiful, its very expensive though but worth a look. Especially if you go to the viewing desk you most well not pay that entry fee and go for a meal
4
A place to be. While the menu is quite ordinary and the prices are somehow linked to the elevation it is a great place. You oversee the Marina Bay - watch the sunset from here. Enjoy the people from all over the world. Don't look for the best food - there are many better place
4
We had dinner at Ku De Ta on a Tuesday night. It's a fantastic spot with a great view of the whole of Singapore. We started with cocktails at the bar which is highly recommended! The food was great and about what you would expect from a 5 star restaurant. The desserts are a particular highlight of the menu and the Singapore Sling is a "must try"
5
We had only 9 hours to spend in Singapour and therefor wanted to have dinner somewere not too far from the hotel (Mandarin Oriental).I booked it just a few hours before the actual dinner purely looking through the travel guide leaflet that I picked up at the airport.The booking was easy and friendly. When we arrived, the restaurant was full and our table was inside. I really wanted to have a table outside to enjoy the spectacular view. It was also my Birthday, so I really wanted something special.We asked for help and within 5 min a mysterious table outside has appeared - and this was already a fantastic start! You know that feeling, when you have not made any plans for your birthday but hope for some lucky turn of event ... Well,looked like we were really lucky and it felt even better as it was with no stress of planning. It was amazing!We got a great table, at the great place for the great occasion...Of course, when you have a great start - the magic usually goes on.Rita was our waiter and she has suggested the specials that we must try. We tried them, and they were fantastic... Every single dish that she recommended was great, if I could order the same again, without exploding - I honestly would. My husband and I love Japanese food and very often eat at Zuma, Nobu and try something different everywhere we travel. And I must say that the quality and "tastiness" of the menu that we tried at KuDeTa was fantastic . Maybe some dishes are just average but what we tried was excellent.I would like personally to salut the chef for the menu and the team for the rest - they made our evening truly unforgettable! But most importantly, the team at KuDeTa deserves a real big "thank you" for making the evening really special, that everything felt so effortless ,so efficient and so human. We felt looked after by everyone.Thank you Chef, thank you Rita, thank you KuDeT
4
The place is incredible. Great views, really kind and helpful staff. Food is acceptable, good and diverse. The problem is the price. It is expensive for what you pay. I'm Europe or America there are better restaurants with more reasonable prices. However we are in Singapore, and probably this one is one of the best around.There is a minimum spend of 80 SIN$, but it is easy to get there -great dishes with fish in any possible way. Enjoy the sashimi salad!! -desserts are absolutely fantastic -meat is all imported, so I believe is better to try the fish.-very diverse wine menu, but really expensive!The place is great to be enjoyed. Recommendable!
5
It was a pleasure to arrive an hour before dusk and have a drink at the majestic bar while surveying the sights of the city as it moved from sunshine, thru twilight to night. The Staff were excellent and kept their distance when not required. (Thanks Kini) The Food and wine are expensive, there is no getting around that but the quality of the whole experience is well worth the slightly warm credit card that results. I would have liked to have had free range to the veiwing platforms and the next floor down but were told that it was extra, which was disappointing and surprising considering the amount of $$$$ we spent dining there
5
The best thing about this restaurant is the view of Singapore. If you're lucky enough to get a table outside you will get a great view. We made a reservation as it was a Friday night. Service is great, quick and very friendly. The cocktails were fabulous, but expensive, to be expected for this venue though so we didn't mind. The salt and pepper calamari was delicious. The deserts were amazing too. Definitely worth a visit
5
Marina Bay Sands Hotel with the rooftop Ku De Ta bar was memorable -- nothing like it in the world. Just as good a view at night time as in Hong Kong but with a more impressive perspective from above! Beautiful lights on all sides as one looks down. The bar waiter won my wife's praise by bringing us some potato chips with the Urban Breeze cocktail and my Belgian beer. Definitely worth a visit
3
The food was good. You can not see the view from most tables. The staff were great. But this place is really overproced.
5
Treated ourselves to a night out with friends, had a wonderful night, excellent food and wine, the staff were attentive but not intrusive. We shared a variety of different dishes and all were outstanding, in particular the pork belly and duck breast were excellent.
5
A must in Singapore!
great food, great service, great ambience, not expensive for this location.
next door bar is a must too.
4
This restaurant is at its best for its location and exemplary staff. i really appreciate the staff who served our orders specially nica, ivo, cha and leowy. they are very kind and they make you enjoy the dining experience you deserve to pay. despite that the food and drinks are really expensive they taste very good to me. Ambiance is really romantic (very good for wedding proposals!) the view is fantastic as your are having dinner at the topmost level of marina bay sands. i really commend the staff who are very friendly and nice to us! i suggest that you go and try to visit this restaurant specially for anniversary or any romantic dinner
4
We went here for our anniversary dinner and it was quite nice. The staff was very friendly and professional, but the food was average. We have been to better places in Singapore. However, the view is indeed incredible! Make sure to, however, reserve a table at the edges where you can have a good view.We will probably not come back for dinner again but for drinks only! :
4
The view is incredible from this restaurant. Ambience is great. The service is excellent. Food is over-priced but that's got to be expected in this type of fancy joint in a city like Singapore. Drinks are also very expensive, but I guess they need to charge enough to keep the doors open. I enjoyed my experience there, but I had good company, so maybe that made the difference.
4
KU DE TA, is a place with an amazing view, so chilled and relaxed overlooking the whole of Singapore. Their drinks menu is extensive and in my point of view the highlight of the restaurant itself. I can't say much for the food as I have not personally tried it however by reading a few reviews it is pretty clear that its ore of a bar and snacks sorta place, especially during the day. If I am not mistaken up until 5pm or 5.30 there's no dress code perse more smart casual however I think you'd have to check if your going a bit later as there was a certain charge ? or even a dress code from what I recall seeing on their banner.We had their White Wine Sangria (jug) it was really good except I would have much preferred it without the "star anise" as Im no at all a fan of that seed so that made the drink a bit off for me. So do request it without if your not fond or unsure of what it taste like. Apart from that I would recommend visiting Ku De Ta instead of paying I think 25Sing Dollars to go up to their deck at the last level from a different entrance, It was much better sipping a chilled cocktail which cost almost the same or actually cheaper and at the same time able to take in the view and snapping away the camera then to just pay for the entrance fee for visiting the top deck. Just my preference though, I hope you have a lovely time up there as it was a memorable one for me
5
Spectacular view of Singapore with great food and service. That says it all. We arrived for a pre-dinner cocktail on the terrace under the red umbrellas, just upon sunset and then settled in for dinner. I Absolutely loved the "Lady, be mine" cocktail with rose water and lychees, finished with a single red rose petal. The food was good. We had the soft shell crab roll, crispy sticky baby squid with lime, salmon and duck. The salmon was cooked perfectly. The service was faultless However, like a number of restaurants lately the lighting was very, very, very dim. This adds to the ambience, however, I find the lack of lighting slightly frustrating when you are trying to see what you are eating and where you are going. It is not cheap, but worth it if you are visiting Singapore.
4
The food is great, the view spectacular and the ambience is cool and funky. Enjoyed a great night out with friends who had not been to Singapore before. It was the ideal place to take them. Our waitress Rita made the experience all the more enjoyable. It is a little expense but worth it for the view
5
An excellent dining experience for those with deep pockets, but the food and the view do not disappoint. Friendly personal service from our lovely waitress, Rita, and a visit from the experienced sommelier, rounded out a lovely evening. The foie gras was exceptionally rich and expertly prepared, with the perfect sear and a rich, delicately texture
4
An elegant restaurant with a stunning view, especially if you are sitting outside. Service was impeccable (Patrick) and the food was excellent.
5
Amazing place on the best building with great service and food and drinks, very modern and beautiful views...I highly recommend it especially if staying in the hotel...FANTASTIC PLACE
5
A great start to my Singapore experience. Amazing views, great food and wonderful service! Thank you Rita for making it a wonderful lunch!
4
We went for my partners birthday, the food was good and the service was good. I really enjoyed the scallops and the desserts, obviously expensive but great for a treat.
4
The food is good, the view is spectacular, but this is not a cheap eat. Humourless security guards greet you as you exit lifts on the rooftop. Obviously trying to keep the "great unwashed" from the famous infinity pool. Our first lift entrance was the wrong one, not allowed to walk past the pool, even though we had a lunch reservation. Poor form, again humourless in delivery and almost dismissive. Our 5 star hotel made our reservation so we had a confirmation in writing that said nothing about certain entrances. Similarly frosty was the receptionist when we finally reached the restaurant. Thankfully we finally happened upon a couple of friendly floor staff and relaxed into our Sunday lunch. A mixed experience all in all, and an expensive one. We don't mind paying. We do mind all the negative experiences that came with it.
5
Drinks with the family followed by dinner for two to celebrate 20th wedding anniversary, what a place, what a view! You literally feel on top of the world! We treated ourselves to a tasting menu, had no idea what we were eating really, but it was all washed down with copious glasses of great wine, and a surprise plate of chocolate treats at the end to mark the occasion. It cost a lot, but sometimes you just have to do it! Live for today etc etc
5
Read and heard a few things about this restaurant over the last few days. I rang on the morning of 3/9/14 and was trying my luck...had the choice of 3 sittings, 730 was sublime. Food was sensational wine list was outstanding would like to see a few more Aussie wines but hey was a great list. Couldn't fault the service. Carly was outstanding even if she had her name tag upside down.After dinner a drink at the bar was the perfect way to finish off the night.Yes it's a bit pricey but you expect that. It's more about the experience. Strongly recommended
3
We went as a group of eight guys, we are here on business but had the day off to explore Singapore. We are not the most beautiful group of guys, I would definitely suggest wearing at least a casual button up shirt or something fashionable to this place or you will feel out of place. Some of the guys with me were dressed very casual and you could tell the servers really didn't care about us because of that. I was hoping to get a cocktail but they basically forced us into all getting a round of S$20 Stella's and then gave us the check right a way trying to get rid of us. The cocktails are about the same price which is why I'd rather have been given a chance to order. Despite all of this I still have to give this place a good review because it's location is so unbelievable. I just wish they would be a little more considerate.

First review but this restaurant drove me to it!Venue...location incredible...iconic in fact but please save yourself the pain of dinner and just go for an expensive drink instead.Where it started....We had dinner booked for 8.15- arrived a little early so enjoyed a drink at the bar..my wife wanted to get a picture of the city so we requested could we go to the skypark attached to the restaurant but we were declined - "paying customers and residents only" correct me if I am wrong but admission was $20 and my first drink alone had well covered this wide food bill to follow.Food - $80++ per person min spend. Not that I am concerned w/ this (esp when expectations of food are high) but surely there is a more discrete way of dealing w/ this. Starter: soft shell crab and squid was average at best. In fact, I think I am being kind here...my local fish and chip shop are nicer! Endamane beans were good. Main: lobster tempura and prawn curry tempura...there was more flavour and fun out of the dipping sauces than the mains themselves. Maybe it was my choices but looking around I think it was a common trend.Desert: skipped after such poor experience.Service: waitress that was excellent at clearing plates the second we were finished, delay between delivery of my wife's meal and my own meal...didn't once ask us how our meal was and confusion between who was our actual waiter as a guy came over 2/3 times introducing himself as our waiter but was complaining that the other tables were keeping him busy. Total cost:2 x pre drinks1 x bottle of wine2x starters2x mains$330 sgp dollars!!!Lesson to others: don't be fooled by the name or location...this place is below average....if you like food go elsewhere. Poor quality that takes advantage of its location

Went there sometimes ago.There was a $80 per person minimum charge. The view was nice, looking at Singapore from 57th floor.The fishes, are a bit so sweet, and the steaks are good, but not superior. Service was nice.If you come to get impressed by the view, this is a good place. For food quality... I would say, just OK.

Unique experience having a lunch on a ship stranded high in the air, dinning on Asian fusion meal that have surprised our taste buds. The best squid dish we've had, and amazing combination of tastes for three other tasty morsels we tried.
5
Everything was exceptional; the food; the view and the service. Pricey but good value. Recommended for a special occasion or a first introduction to Singapore. Go in the early evening to experience the best of day and night views
4
We visited the bar for a couple of drinks instead of paying for a ticket to the Sky Park. The berry bellini's are absolutely delicious and appropriately over-priced. Service was a tad slow but it's totally worth it for the views and great photo opportunities.
5
Visiting the sky deck of the Marina Sand Bay towers is something not to miss when you are in Singapore. The view is marvelous. I took my time to enjoy and had lunch at the Ku De Ta Restaurant. This restaurant on the rooftop is a must. The food is delicious and the service is making you feel more than comfortable. The place is really like heaven
5
Amazing setting and terrific food. We were staying at the hotel so was very easy to get access up to the restaurant. Food was great, service excellent, obviously on the pricey side but look around you're on top of the world! We got a seat outside on the balcony and it was exceptional.We had a late booking so got a bit loud towards the end and a drunk English bloke was given way too much leeway with his behavior on a table nearby. That didn't spoil our adventure though
3
We were told we had to go there so we did. Went to ku de ta on 57 th floor BUT only to the bar. This is no review on restaurant. The bar staff were really professional, the drinks cold and as expected, view sensational, atmosphere intimate, prices.....look if you are going here for a drink then expect to pay top $, then you won't be disappointed or outraged. We even bought a second round because we were there, weather was great and...well...there is the view. We left pretty happy with the experience.
4
Excellent restaurant, tried for lunch, dinner and brunch as well as for drinks - the food has improved considerably over the past few years and so has the service - some really good options, a menu which adapts to seasons/products and provides a cohesive selection and the best sommelier in Singapore all make for a great evening
5
I visited with some friends on a trip to Singapore. View is amazing, cocktails incredible, service good, I recommend the Lady Marmalade cocktail. Take a hat if you aren't lucky enough to get a shaded table near the bar, as it gets quite sweltery up there
3
Asian Fusian meets tapas on the top of the marina bay sands hotel. Food is OK but youâ€™re not there for an epicurean experience. Fun place, great bar and a great view. Reservations are a must and expect to be told that they need your table back in about 2 hours for another reservation. Great for out of town visitors
5
We had some truly excellent cocktails here. The views are amazing. People come in their droves to watch the wonderful sunsets. We didn't eat there but the food I saw beng served around me looked great. The staff are lovely and friendly.An excellent spot to while away a few lazy hours
5
The food and service could not be faulted and were reasonably price considering the location. The nighttime views were also spectacular looking over the Singapore skyline. We were given a complimentary fruit platter to finish in the outdoor cocktail area which was a lovely touch
5
My husband was lovely enough to take me to Ku De Ta for my birthday. From the moment we stepped out of the lifts and were greeted by the gorgeous reception girls I felt like a VIP.We were escorted out to the terrace for sunset cocktails and when Simon the General Manager found out it was my birthday and it was my first time to Ku De Ta I was given a glass of champagne and star treatment through out the night. Ben the bar tender treated us to luscious Ku De Ta cocktails on the terrace, and to top it off there was a fireworks display in preparation for National Day I was told- but birthday celebration suited me!The food was delicious, along with the service. I have been to a number of other restaurants considered of equal standing in Asia and this was for me the loveliest evening, put together by my wonderful husband, Simon and his team and Ku De Ta. Thanks again Simon
4
I really enjoyed the dinner at Ku De Ta. Waiter were professional and efficient. In my opinion this restaurant is most a bistrot than a restaurant. No table Cloth. Good food anyway. The view of Singapore is amazing, sure a place to visit once in life time
4
though astoundingly expensive this place is a jewel.on top of the marina bay sands....makes it the best place to view the entire skyline of singaporewhether you want to drink or have food or simply relish the views its all packaged into one.The service is smart and efficient considering the the rush of people during the night hoursdrinks and combinations are good with food not that amazing.we went without reservations however still managed a place......however spent our time standing to see singapore in its full glory.a must visit for everyon
5
My colleague booked the restaurant on the same day that we went - we managed to get a reservation for 9:30pm which suggests that if you definitely want to eat here, you may wish to phone 2-3 days ahead to make sure you get the time you want.We were promised an outside table, however they put us on an inside table and didn't move us which was slightly frustrating as other people have said, the view is absolutely stunning - that being said, the food was superbly cooked and really, really high quality. We did the tasting menu which was 160 SGD each so about Â£80 - You got a lot of food and we felt really full afterwards as opposed to certainly tasting menus where you fancy going for a burger afterwards! (maybe that's just me? :-)) The sashimi and oysters were lovely, the fish was well cooked and the chilli mushrooms were also brilliant - basically, lots of different things, different flavours and certainly worth the money.We went outside afterwards for a drink and even at 11:30 the weather and the view were brilliant - there was a live saxophonist and the vibe was brilliant... totally chilled and we just really enjoyed it
5
A fantastic night, staff were amazing and the food is great. From the arrival to the settling of the bill, the entire process was seamless and made Kudeta experience memorable and enjoyable. I'm particularly greatful to Simon for his assistance and flexibility on accomodating our request and dietary requirements. We could not have had a better evening. It is thanks to you and all of your team.
5
We had read some very opposite reviews on this restaurant but decided to check it out for ourselves.The food, service and views were amazing. Don't book here if you are on a budget as it is very expensive but worth every SGD to experience it. From the moment we arrived it the breathtaking views set the mood. A couple of Cointreau's each for two of us was very expensive but just to be on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands and taking in the views was worth. Then onto dinner. It is truly a culinary experience. Service by our waiter Arnie was second to none. When they found out we were celebrating our 25th anniversary they even made a special celebratory desert for us. To enjoy this experience you need to not look at prices but go with flow and be apart of a wonderful dining environment. Put simply "Just Awesome"
2
That place have an amazing view, rates are ok but service is really terrible. We got a pizza and that was a big mistake. No separate plate, no fork no knife. Even we had to ask for the napkin... They push us to pay before we finish. After all go there for the view but dont be so hungry because you will not enjoy your food for sure
5
My wife and I really enjoyed our dinner at Ku De Ta. A special mention to the yutaka roll. Our waiter, Yul, was professional and efficient. Our table was inside, just behind the DJ. The noise level was thus acceptable, but I can understand that it wouldn't have been ideal to be sitting on the terrace next to the speakers. Something to keep in mide when booking
4
Most a bistro than a luxury restaurant. No tablecloth. Personalized service. Nice table facing the wheel and one of the F1 curves ready for the next coming F1 prix.As for the dishes: the key is the raw material: the best chutoro, the best Kobe.Also excellent maguro rolls, excellent soft crab, baby squid did not surprised us, as in Spain we have what we call "rabas" and it is quite the same, and to close the dessert: garam masala, chocolate and red fruits explosion of flavors.Drinks: 2 red vine and 1 white wine by te glass. We paid the same as a 2** Michelin in Spain and ate as a good bistro, but all well paid as there are not many options in Europe to eat real and fresh chutoro and kobe together with astonishing view. As for the Club, complimentary acces for being restaurant guests.MEdiocre gin tonic, nice ambiance, many expats and again, excellent views
5
just went for a drink between 7 and 8 pm...what an amazing view over singapore ! a place to visit once in lifetime. Very busy too so hard to find a spot where to sit down
4
Awesome view from the top. Limited menu options but food is quite good. Service is slow but efficient and staffs friendly. Great atmosphere!
5
Located on top of marina bay - perfect setting for a special event. Nice buzz, great food, good cocktails, amazing views!
4
The food and drinks were very good. a good selection of Gin available. For special occasions a fine place to dine.
1
Family was in town and really wanted to have dinner on top of mbs. Firstly they gave us a table next to the DJ booth, underneath the overhead speakers, with a "caution wet floor" sign right next to our table. Asked to change tables as there were 3 empty centre tables with cutlery, but they made up some cock & bull story about the tables not being ready yet. Were not drinking that night, so asked for a mocktail menu, waitress said they didn't have one and rattled out about 20 mocktail names and expected us to choose on the spot. When we asked what was in one of the mocktails, she just said "a mix of different sodas" - not helpful, and clearly doesn't know what she was talking about. Food was OK at best. When we finally asked for the bill, they informed us of a minimum spend per table, which we were not informed of earlier. Anyway, general consensus, if it were not for the view, ku de ta will have gone bust a long long time ago
5
We've been here for a business lunch. Maybe that is what you can afford since Singapore gets truly expensive at dinner times. In any case we had beef and tuna plus different soups. Taste and looking of the food was excellent and whenever you took a look from your plate up the horizon we could see the top of deck Marina Bay Sands hotel. Since you're located higher than MBS this is a rare view I guess. Price is high but again spectacular things are barely for free. Service was very good and servants friendly (not always the case in SG).I think about going again with the family in order to show a special place
3
Good views but not allowed on the observation deck(where the views were better) even when paying about 14pd for a cocktail.You have to pay a service charge and GST on top of bar prices.Had to ask for our change!Lebua in Bangkok is better.If visiting have a cocktail on the Singapore flyer instead
4
We were staying at Marina Bay Sands Hotel and came for an early dinner after an incredible day at the pool. The food was very gastronomic and high end. The menu is listed on the hotel's website so you can check it out before you go. My kids only picked at the food. I thought it was delicious. I only had one glass of wine because it was so pricey. The view is incredible, of course. I would recommend you see this place at least once, if you can.
4
We loved our time on the SkyPark level. We don't often get up to the 57th floor and this was a real pleasure. At home in Vancouver we eat Japanese food a couple of times a week and the Bento Box was delicious: a light touch assuming people of many cultures would be eating it. We noticed that 3/4s of the people were eating the basic Bento Box and enjoying it; especially that they were offered so much good food for such a low price! Well done
5
I was fortunate to experience my first visit on the night of Singapore's birthday celebrations. I will keep this brief as the main points are about the food, service and the majestic view. All were exceptional.The service I received was calm, unobtrusive, professional and so efficient, the food had my taste buds dancing (foie gras especially), the wine and cocktails had my body doing the same later in the evening, they have a brilliant selection.I noticed all staff were happy working which is an endorsement of good management. Fabio (manager) and Lightner (sommelier) and a few other names I can't remember or spell, these people contributed to my fantastic evening. Must not forget the view, being there on this special occasion seeing the fireworks, jets etc was the icing on the cake. Cant wait to do it all again!!!
4
fantastic view and elegance and restaurant . the service is super fast and they care for the customer. the only minor is that the portions are very small and gourmet
4
Raise a glass to your Singapore holiday at this cool venue on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel
5
Wow, what an amazing evening we had at Ku De Ta! The food was amazing (compliments to the chef) and the ambiance and view was wonderful. Cannot wait to go back and experience it again!
5
If the spectacular view and ambiance from the Marina Bay Sands skydeck doesn't take your breath away then try the signature paired menu - you will not be disappointed. Service was exceptional and made for a very memorable experience.
5
Ku De Ta is an amazing place for having a nice drink in Singapore with a fantastic view. The atmosphere is chilled and the cocktails can be highly recommended (I tried 2-3 different ones and all of them were really good) and at the same time you can see the pool from the Marina Bay without paying or staying there. Allover a nice experience
3
There is no competition. Perhaps in another city like Lebua in Bangkok. But there is no competition in Singapore. This restaurant is the HotSpot in Singapore. The view is fantastic. The food is sufficient. Due to its position many people try to get a seat in the restaurant. If you come with high expectations if you might be disappointed. Expect a rooftop bar with some high-priced bar food like you find it all over the world. Then it is okay
5
We found the location fantastic, the food very good but the thing very special is the staff.We received like friends and with great courtesy.Mr.Fabio , the manager of the restaurant showed us all the lounge and the varios points of view of the roof restaurant
3
To be clear, if you only have 24 hours in Singapore or it’s your first time there, I would probably recommend you to come here. It is THE best view in Singapore! But that is about it unfortunately. Service is pretty slow and the food is average, but very expensive. Also the place is overrun by tourists just wanting to take a picture. Still, if you want to be blown away by scenic views of Singapore while having sushi and a cocktail – this is the place. Ask to be seated outside and in first row to the vie
5
We were staying at Marina Sands Bay hotel and we decided to eat there as we were too tired to venture out (besides so many friends had recommended it). We went with our 2 children (8 & 10) who were probably the only children there for dinner, but no one really seemed to matter. We ordered the degustation menu for 2 and what a feast it was! There wasn't a single 'just good' dish, everything was absolutely outstanding! Special mention to the sushi, foie gras, the pork lollipops and the dessert...what a gastronomic delight! We only order the black cod apart from the menu and it was out of this world! A lot better than its counterparts in Nobu or Zuma, truly wonderful!As we had been sipping cocktails all afternoon at the hotels amazing pool, we didn't drink much. Only ordered a sangria for two. The only sour note was the bill, oh dear was that an expensive dinner at SGD 600 (for a meal for 2 -as my kids had eaten earlier at the pool and they only nibbled from our dishes- and with hardly any alcohol!) It was hilarious as we put it into our room and when I went to pay the hotel the man at reception was gobsmacked at the bill at Ku De Ta and asked me if it was a big party and if we had drunk a lot (no in boths accounts). He told me that was extremely expensive in Singapore (and probably in Mars too!) Anyway, thought it was funny. In spite of the shocking price, it was worth it in my book. It was one of the most memorable culinary experiences in my entire life (and I'm quite the foody!) So glad it will not being only remembered by the hefty pricetag but for the amazing and beautifully presented food. So if you can afford it, just go
4
Decided to splash out on KU DE TA because of the location; requested outside table but was told there weren't any available but we would be moved to one when one became free; we thought this was just a ruse to placate us but true enough in between our starter and main course they moved us, which was very nice. Food was very good although quite pricey. Service was very helpful and courteous
4
Nothing to complain regarding the food in this restaurant but perhaps compared to the prices not the best deals. However location at the top of Marina Bay Sands offers amazing views & worth a visit just for views..
5
I took the brunch on sunday, the food was interesting and the dessert buffet fantantic.the view is amazing expecially during a sunny day!!The price is not incredibly high
4
Excellent over-looking view at night! You can ask for Ms. Marycel and Ken to be your service crew.. They are so kind and service oriented.
Try to visit and feel the experience. Value for money!
5
Always a favourite for me when visiting Singapore .. mainly for the view.. and the food never disappoints.. Mainly I go for the crew's recommendations.. having asked them what's the most popular.. and they're always realistic about the amount to order (its generally small shared portions.. delivered as and when ready from the kitchen). Asian with a touch of Fusion is the order of the day..and.. the deserts are usually quite delicious.. so leave some room :-)The view is beautiful.. overlooking the Marina and over to the 'colonial' older buildings..which have been sensitively renovated, and the quays on one side, the Flyer and the Spiral bridge in front and the gorgeous gardens on the other side.. look out for the 'infinity pool' adjacent to the Restaurant (part of the hotel complex) and the nightclub. Don't forget the light and music show every evening on the Marina.. This view gives a whole new perspective.. The price is what you want it to be.. depending on what you order to eat and drink.. it can go from reasonable to very expensive..It's a lovely experience, and a lovely way to spend an evening in Singapore..check the weather because its best to be outside.. and you need to book.

Ku De Ta as a venue - is stunning. The food is great, however I had an unfortunate experience with a waiter whom informed me I was not allowed to take photos of the view. In fact, he was so rude and dismissive, that I felt humiliated in front of a nearby table, even a lady on the other table gave me an apologetic look on behalf of the waiter. I wasn't in anyones way keeping to myself for less than a minute (in fact I'm not the photo crazy type) standing in front of an empty table still within the restaurant area which we ate in, not even past the security rails (which by the way is only allowed for certain guests to access - apparently restaurant diners cannot get close to take photos of the view at any rate). It's disappointing when we had in fact just spent over $700 dollars on food and wine
5
Went there with my daughter to the roof top bar and had a lovely few cocktails while the sun set. A perfect place to see the view over Singapore. Met a wonderful manager Benedict Gerard , be sure to speak to him about places to go in Singapore too. Thanks Benedict 
5
The restaurant and bar are a beautiful location with magnificent views, the staff were incredibly friendly and made us feel welcome from start to finish. The chief sommelier, Michael, was incredibly hospitable and made our visit even more memorable. This was our first visit to Singapore and an unforgettable experience in a wonderful city.
4
Visited this restaurant during a stop over. They insist on a minimum spend for you to eat here, but it's a pricey menu so don't worry too much about hitting the $80 number!Service was average, not particularly great, but not terrible either.The view from the hotel is fantastic of course.The food was incredible! We had the duck, pork belly, swordfish sashimi and chocolate desert, and it was all very, very good. The cocktails were great as well
5
Aside from an amazing view as you would expect on top of the Marina Sands Hotel, the service by the staff stands out. From the moment we walked in, they were very attentive to our needs without being too 'in your face'. Special mention to Leo who had the patience of explaining to us the food, the history of the place and the info about surroundings. He was more than the usual supervisor. While we have not tasted all the food, there are a few that is worth mentioning -- spicy tuna roll, fried squid, and Brocolini. I expected to have spent more with a full meal for 2 and 2 glasses of wine. This makes it a value for money for a Resto in a prime location. I'm surely going back
4
If you are not staying at Marina Bay Sands during your visit to Singapore and don't have time to jump on to the sky ride to see Singapore's amazing views, you could dine at Ku De Ta and enjoy good food with amazing views. It could be a little on the expensive side but if you have great company, then why not indulge a little?
5
The view is the thing here but the food is still quite good and not too pricey considering the location. The service was very attentive and professional.
5
Location is outstanding, food is varied and interesting, service is attentive. A great location to have a great time with friends and family.
5
I stayed away for a long time thinking it was over-rated. I was proved very wrong. Ben, the head supervisor was attentive and extremely helpful. He even loaned me his iphone (as I had left mine at home). The food was superb. Fresh clean sushi and amazing cod. Our waiter, Brian (or Ryan) was the epitome of Singapore hospitality. Warm and knowledgeable - and he discouraged us from over-ordering. They prepared a little birthday cake with a candle at the very last minute as a surprise for my guest. Ben also seated us at the very best table - he tried hard to make it a very special night for us. And it was. Dress up in your favorite LBD and kitten heels and be prepared to be wowed !!! Reminded me so much of the Skybar in Mondrian in LA (with a Singapore twist). Well done !!
3
We went to the bar but clearly just for the view. From the terrace, you'll have the opportunity to see the gardens by the bay and the marina but don't eat or drink more than a beer (or a fresh coconut at the bar because it's way overpriced. The staff was ok but we were told to leave early because of their dress code... Just order take a few photos and find a better place to enjoy drinks and food, Singapore has so much more to offer
3
Went there for dinner earlier in the year to celebrate my birthday and was underwhelmed.It was far from bad, but I'd been looking forward to going there for some time and the feeling for both of us was that he food was just okay and, given the price, it's not worth it. Strangely we ran into a couple of friends on a different table on their first visit and they shared the same view.Reading a few of the other reviews I'm not sure whether we just had an off night, but it wasn't reflected in the bill which was expensive - even for Singapore.I wouldn't go back but would suggest checking it out. Or, alternatively, go and enjoy a pre dinner drink at Ku De Ta and enjoy the same view and then move on to somewhere else to eat
5
We decided to come here for lunch as we had been up to the top of the Marina Bay Sands before but fancied doing it a little differently this time. We didn't reserve but just turned up at the bottom of tower 3 and they sent us upstairs. You don't need to have food, there were a few people just having a drink. You can also sit inside. We had a beef tenderloin, ribeye steak, spicy janapese mushrooms and flower rice. It was fabulous. Probably our best meal in our 2.5 week holiday. The portions were huge and we did struggle to finish it. The staff were also really nice. They chatted away and were very friendly. They were full of suggestions for both lunch and the afternoon ahead. Clearly you are going to pay for this but Â£100 was fair for the quality and location
5
I was able to have brunch with my friends at Ku De Ta Restaurant in Singapore and the experience was amazing. The foods are very tasty. Even though I am not fond of eating raw food, I was able to enjoy their sashimi and their oysters are very fresh. Thanks to their chefs and also to their staffs who are very friendly and accommodating and always smile, specially Ms. Rita who's very attentive to all our needs. The delectable food compliments the very nice ambiance of the restaurant and completes it with the fantastic view of Singapore. Kudos to Ku De Ta Restaurant
4
We decided it was going to cost quiet a bit of money to just go upto the top of the Marina Sand for a look so thought having lunch up there would be a better choice and it was. You can go up and have lunch or have a drink and enjoy the view. We opted for the tasting lunch which delivered us small plates of the stunning food. The staff where attentive and lovely and while we had the option of sitting outside it was very very hot so we choose to eat in the air conditioned restaurant. We did venture outside to the skydeck bar afterwards and enjoyed a Singapore Sling in the sun.
5
One of the most beautiful meals we had in Singapore was at Ku De Ta in the Marina Bay Sands. The food was beautiful and was enjoyed by the whole family. Our waiter Arlan was brilliant and the restaurant was very accommodating to one of our children who decided to sleep through the entire meal (luckily we were seated in a booth). The highlight was the most amazing apple dessert which was enjoyed by the entire family. To top off the brilliant food and service, nothing can beat the view
5
A group of 5 of us had dinner here. The service was excellent making sure that we were well looked after. The food is served as Asian sharing plates and was high quality and delicious. Dessert is a must. The only thing to prepare yourself for is that the wine is expensive even more so than the expensive prices you find in Singapore but don't let that stop you having a great dinner with spectacular views.
5
My wife and I really enjoyed dining here on a Friday evening the city view is amazing. We received excellent and professional service from our sommelier Michael Leitner who was very knowledgable and who gave us some great suggestions based on our preferences the food is delicious specially the roast pork belly. It's a classy place with great ambience. I will recommend this restaurant to my friend
3
Had visited quite a while back so was reluctant to go there when I had guests in town recently.Overall, the food was good, the service well below par, considering a $80 per head cover charge !!!If you are visiting Singapore, then the place should be on your list of places to visit
5
Me and my family went to kudeta at marina bay sands for a brunch. When we got there, the staffs politely welcome us. The view was spectacular and breathaking. I must say that their food was excellent!! The service was superb. Thanks to Rita, Maurice, Loewy and all the staffs in the resto who assisted us. They are so nice, very attentive and helpful. Thanks also to their chef who made me bloated due to his delectable meals. One of my favorite is the baby squid. All the staffs in the sky bar wear their smiles even under the scorging sun. I will surely go back to this place and will definitely recommend this place to all my friends
4
The restaurant looks great with superb views of singapore due to it being on top of a hotel, service as usual in singapore was good but regimented as usual, the food was fabulous but found it rather strange to be asked mid mouthful of my dessert to be asked if I wanted to finish on the terrace...no! Give me five minutes and I can go, they wanted to close, that's the regimented bit that can drive you up the wall in singapore, luckily a young man rescued the situation and said take your time, enjoy your expensive wine, no hurry, he wasn't singaporean, philipino's are so pleasant. Great place for dinner and the outside bar is good too
1
We visited kudeta to celebrate our last night in Singapore. Very overrated and food appalling. We ordered approximately 9 dishes. The pork lollipops were full of fat more than the meat, the squid was extremely tough. When you pay over $300.00 for 8 tapas dishes you expect the best. The portions are much smaller than normal tapas size and realistically we should of ordered double the amount for 4 of us. If you are going for the view and wish to take photos , you can not go out on the observation deck which circles the restaurant, unless you are a hotel guest or wish to pay $27.00 to enter. If you can try and imagine the restaurant is like an island that sits in the middle of the observation deck. You will need to try take pictures from the bar area. You also can not walk to the edges of the restaurant to try get a better view or photo unless your table is located there. The other observation was the service was average. There was certainly no effort. The only enjoyable part was the cocktails. I certainly would not return or recommend kudeta Singapore and we left extremely disappointed and hungry
3
Came here for late night dining. Very nice ambience outdoors in the evening, great views if you manage to snag a table at the side.We were not overly impressed with the food here. We had some sashimi, a salad and the ribeye, which whilst competently executed, were nothing exceptional for the price they came at. A very average bottle of wine was just over $100, which brought the bill to $400 for our late night snack.If I were a tourist, I would probably have this place on my bucket list. Unlike KuDeTa in Bali, I really cannot find a compelling reason to return
3
Ku de Ta Singapore is certainly a hip place. Perched high atop the Marina Sands tower it has fantastic views. The food is passable, the service can't be complained about. However, it is not value for money. The prices must be linked to the venue's high location. I don't mind paying for great food service and wine. But, I get a sour taste when I pay S$25 ++ for a 100ml of mediocre wine. Ku de Ta in Bali works. It suits the laid back beach atmosphere. This one doesn't; it simply smacks of opportunistic gouging
5
It is an amazing experience to admire wow views of Singapore, sipping delicious cocktail and relaxing at night... We didn't find the service particularly friendly or attentive but the experience of being so high with all the sparkling lights around was worth the visit. It is a must cool romantic place to see at night
5
May be the coolest view of all time high above Singapore. The food, the view and the service are all great. This is a must for all travelers to Singapore. We had some questions and the GM (Simon) immediately came over and handled it perfectly. Very classy dude, running a very hip and well done establishment. Highly recommended

Fisrt of all the view is stunning maybe the best in singapore, i' ve been there many times even for take a glass or for dinner it's always great, and the sommelier Michael Leitner is perfect he always advise us the good wine with our meal and when he can, he take time with the customers to talk and we always appreciate that. Also all the staff are nice. I recommand this place and i will be back with pleasure

This place is great - situated on the roof (57 floors up) of the Marina Sands hotel, it offers great food and a fun atmosphere with amazing views of the city.

My husband and I had been frequenting Kudéta Bali for years every summer, this year we decided to try its Singapore sister. We made a great choice. Warm reception, excellect service and scrumptious meal. Sharie and Michelle surprised me with a decadent dessert for my birthday. A viewing was arranged for us at the viewing deck to end our night. Thank you Kudéta, Sharie and Michelle! We will definitely be back

Ku De Ta is at the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel so has the best views in Singapore. You have to book well in advance for the restaurant which is excellent but you can get the experience by just visiting the viewing platform or bar (you may still need to book as I think only a certain number of people can go at one time). The restaurant food is unusual in that it's sharing plates, so you book one or two starters and plates of 4 will come out and you share, then the same with main etc. First class food and service but extremely expensive (everything is extra) and can't say it was one our favourite restaurants from our trip, but certainly the best views

A friend in Australia recommended it, so I went to see if it was just an over priced tourist trap or not. Well, it isn't cheap, but where is if you want quality in Singapore. You are on top of the world, the service is attentive and good. I didn't find SGD 160 for a good bottle of Pouilly Fume to be over the tope. The maki rolls were very good, as was the main dish of duck and pork cheeks. The service was attentive and on the ball and the views and ambience good. Funnily, a waitress suggested we move outside around 1600 after lunch, the manager came to find us and ushered us back inside once he realised we were hot and not interested in staying outside, so more wine was had. All in all a good experience all round, a pleasant surprise, surprising Singapore
5
We have eaten at Ku de Ta before, and it was great then, but our latest visit was even better. We sat inside and the view was still spectacular. The service was perfectly timed for our drinks and food, the waiters were friendly and professional. The food was truly delicious, as were the Martinis and Sangria. It was a great night out, special and memorable. Thank you Ku De Ta

We recently celebrated a special birthday at the Ku De Ta, perched on top of the Marina Bay Sands. As we sat in the terrace area, sipping excellent French champagne on a warm balmy night, words can not describe the stunning views of the Singapore skyline. We opted for the degustation menu and, although rather pricey, found the dishes lived up to their reputation - delicious selections beautifully constructed and presented, and teamed with the perfect wine. Patrick, our waiter for the evening, was friendly and knowledgeable without being intrusive, and added that professional touch to the evening. He couldn't do enough for us.I highly recommend the Ku De Ta for a memorable night
5
So, when in Singapore, one must go to the Marina Bay Sands and at least have a drink at Ku De Ta (Either the restaurant or the Club Lounge). Regardless, the view is simply spectacular. You can get close to a 360 degree view of the city from virtually any spot. There is simply nothing like it. The food is good but not great, the service, like in most of Singapore, is wonderful, but the ambience simply cannot be beat.

i went there with my girlfriend and had reserve a table for dinner from ten onwards .. they gave me an amazing table with a breathtaking view, our hostess was nice and they were very attentive.. the food was great , great champagne and wine and the manager decided to give the cake on the house :) one of the best nights i spent with my girl friend in singapore.
4
Ok just to say you have done it. View is amazing, food is ok but you are crammed in with a bar right beside you so definitely not a "romantic" night out. Quite expensive but you are paying for that view. And the price of eating there does not include access to the viewing platform......
5
Dear Ku Té Ta Team,I had the great pleasure to dine in your restaurant on the 2nd of July with my wife and I must say it was a fabulous evening. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and the best was to meet Mr. Michael Leitner. Mr. Leitner not only suggested us fantastic wines from your menu he also took the time to explain us about the restaurant itself and the hotel. He was definitely going the extra mile. “Not talking about his wine knowledge”. From the beginning to the end we can only say “Thank You” to make our Day so Special
5
We really enjoyed this restaurant, the Atmosphere, the food, the service and the amazing view. You must make a reservation if you want to dine here. We found it to be the highlight of our dining experience in singapore.
5
AMAZING! On top of the incredible Marina Bay Sands building with unrivalled views over Singapore, this restaurant serves fabulous fusion platters to share whilst sipping unique cocktails and admiring the views! The food was amazing too!
5
We decided to stay in Singapore for a night coming back from our Bali holidays. This place was brilliant! The food and cocktails were exceptional! And the view of Singapore is amazing! Big thank you to Arlan for looking after us:)
5
What a view, what a place!!!
Do go if you wanna feel special, if you wanna have an experience which you would cherish in years to come. and do boast about this to friends..
5
We had heard Ku de ta was THE place to go in Singapore and we were not disappointed. The views were stunning, the food divine, the cocktails delicious and the service excellent. Special thanks to Fabio for being so attentive. The only down side was that you could not go for a walk around the observation deck below. Special consideration should be given to restaurant diners. Despite that, we still had some amazing photos and a fabulous dining experience.

My husband I booked here as we were after a special night out. The food was average and not worth the price charged. The service was a bit pretentious as you would expect from a typical bar / restaurant. The ambiance is very trendy/ bar feel so probably not great for a romantic dinner. We were hoping for some amazing views but the window seats were allocated to larger groups. I would save your money & go to the bar for drinks instead as you have access to the same views as the restaurant.

What’s not to love about KU DE TA?First, let me ask you the following: have you ever poached eggs that turned into perfect 5 star hotel-like puffs of white and that won’t fall apart on your toast? Have you ever been able to roll out pasta like that restaurant you fell in love with in Florence? I won’t even ask you if you’re capable of making flaky buttery croissant. Because, in truth, you’ve probably come close but failed to attain the same degree of perfection. But in KU DE TA they have done everything to make it perfect for their guest. I simply love the place, the food and of course the service... special thanks to Mr. Fabio Fasolo.The ambiance of the place was so spacious and yet so welcoming by its beautifully designed interior space. It deserve to be savored in an extraordinary space. This place is all about the atmosphere, which is so well done. The design of the bar is an amazing mix of cosiness that's so fun to hang around and makes you want to stay for hours.Me and my friends were greeted by their friendly staff and was immediately assisted to our seats. Fabio was amazingly helpful in arranging everything for us. Even the smallest detail in the birthday surprise cake and up to selecting the best wine for the occasion. Such a lovely thing that he have done, he is really well above and beyond in providing the best service there is.I would also say that the food were top of the line as well. It is honest food that just that; it doesn’t imitate something you’ve tasted in other restaurant. It just have a exquisite taste of it’s own.Well done KU DE TA...good job Mr. Fabio Fasolo

Visited Ku De ta in Singapore during one of my trips there. the ambience there is to die for and the crowd pretty good. drinks are of course pricey but the view is fantastic from the top of Marina Bay Sands - Ku De Ta.. Must see and highly recommended .. try the Yamazaki 18 Y.O on the rock
4
The views from the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel are stunning.The food is good, but certainly not spectacular.The service was friendly and efficient.This is mass production on a high level, for dinner the restaurant does approx. 3 seatings, so you have 2 hours and then you are asked (politely) to vacate the table for the next guests.Reservations are definitely recommended.Pricing is definitely on the high side
5
My second visit to Ku de Ta didn't disappoint - three of us dined there on the last Sunday of June - two starters, three mains (my Irish strip loin was to die for! ) and a very drinkable Italian wine for $400 SGD - worth every penny!
5
Worth the lift ride alone - the view during fine weather is amazing of Singapore - even more amazing when a tropical storm closes out all view from the restaurant - quality food and service
5
Had a birthday Dinner with 6 of us at Ku De Ta. Tasting menu was fantastic and staff including our waiter Vincent is very attentive and patient .He explained each dish as it came out. A wonderful experience had by all. Best birthday experience!!
5
Best party on a weekday I have ever been to in my life. This place is madness.
Perfect music. Great crowd.

I took my daughter here fir her birthday when she was visiting me in Singapore. It was a lovely evening - it was light when we arrived and the view was beautiful however when the sun went down and the city was alight - it was spectacular - from the Suoergrove trees in Garden by the Bay to the boats on the harbour. We had been told that food was just okay but it proved to be very good and a lovely mix of dishes. We had Sangria too - a very memorable evenin
5
Just has dinner at Ku De Ta. The view from the top of Marina Bay Sands is amazing. We chose to have an early dinner so we could take in the views as the sun went down. Service was amazing and I would say it was one of the best service experiences I have had. The food and drinks were very good and the staff were very happy to make recommendations and take us through the different sections of the menu. There is a two hour turns around on the table but we never felt rushed and then had the opportunity to go outside to the bar areas to see the night lights of Marina Bay. Prices are what you would expect for the location but they are well worth i
5
We had a fantastic evening during our late night dinner at Ku De Ta. We arrived around 9pm and our inside table wasn't ready, but after a fun conversation with the host, we were seated at a really great table outside. The views are spectacular as you expect being on the roof of Marina Bay Sands! We ordered an array of sushi and japanese fusion dishes and everything was fantastic. We were even treated to dessert -- we were stuffed, but again, the dessert was spectacular so how could we stop eating. Great music, great food, great service...definitely on the pricey side, but with all things considered we thought the price was worth it!

Had friends from Netherlands visiting and they were really excited to see Marina Bay Sands and the amazing view from the top of the iconic building. Having dined at Ku De Ta three years ago, I suggested we go there for drinks because I had a pretty good impression of the restaurant.It was late afternoon when we reached and the sun was glaring so my friend (local Singaporean) asked the waiter if there were seats available away from direct sunlight. His response caught us totally off-guard. In the most sarcastic tone, he said "Well....This is a ROOF TOP restaurant sooooo...." The response was not only rude, it was uncalled for.After we got our drinks (a jug of Sangria and a glass of Whiskey), another group of foreign visitors joined our table as there was no other table available. We were perfectly fine with that until we realised that when they got their drinks, also the same jug of Sangria, it came with a bucket of ice, whereas we were not even aware that this was available! Talk about discrimination in service! To add on to our already somewhat unpleasant experience, we were given just 10 minutes to finish our drinks as the restaurant was getting ready for dinner service, otherwise we will have to bring our drinks to stand at the bar counter. Could this information not have even provided to us earlier so we could time ourselves to finish our drinks? We still had more than half the jug of Sangria left and we were rushed to finish it (of course we didn't want to stand at the bar!)Instead of leaving my guests with an incredible impression of Ku De Ta, they were annoyed and very horrified with the standard of service, totally unexpected, given the premium price we had to pay for our drinks! The discrimination in service was too evident to be ignored (we had 2 locals, 1 Dutch man and 1 Singaporean who has been staying in Netherlands for the last 20 years) and we really hope the service staff can learn to be less rude. After all, everyone is a paying customer there for a good time!

On top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel the restaurant is five star with magnificent views of Singapore.You need to make a reservation a couple of days before you go; I would recommend early evening and ask for a outside table.Arrive early, there is no charge for the elevator if you have a restaurant reservation. Have a couple of drinks at the roof top bar before the meal and soak in the views. There is a lack of seating at the bar I guess so they can accommodate more people.The meal was to a high international standard, it was good but expensive. I enjoyed the meal, and for a change finish with the wasabi ice cream for dessert.The restaurant is not a place you would go every day but for a special occasion or once when passing thru Singapore I would recommend it
5
Unusual for a restaurant to be this good, when they have a view like this, as usually they trade off that and the food is forgotten, but this ticks all boxes. Be warned though, if you sit outside and you visit in the rainy or even coming up to the rainy season, it can throw it down quite suddenly, and inside does get very busy. The circular table is ideal as it is near the open windows, but when there was a thunderstorm, we stayed dry and enjoyed the spectacular lightining
4
Didn't eat here but instead went for a night time drink. It's the perfect spot to see the view and with the ability to but a drink for less than the price of going to the viewing deck. I think its the best value in town
4
The service was a little cold but still very efficient. A big thumbs-up for the adventurous menu, too. Not cheap, but worth it.
4
Had to visit to check the views which wee superb. Service was fine, salt & pepper squid as good as, and pink beer! OK raspberry hoegarden, which very gluggable. Cool sounds; Wang Chung meets Bob Marley mix was superb.
5
The venue was excellent, made even better by practise for Singapore national day - helicopter fly pass, F16s and fireworks.
Staff were great and explained the menu and answered questions
The food was marvellous and full of invention
1
This is only a place to be seen. Go to the viewing platform but avoid Ku De Ta. The prices are exorbitant, the service and quality of food was appalling for what you pay. We can eat better in a food hall ... and with more courteous service.We went with business colleagues and vow to strike this off our list as a never to return. They should review their OVERCROWDING policy because this place just crams as many people in as possible. They don't seen to care about your personal comfort ... they only want your money
4
It is all about the view and the vibe. Spectacular location, good service and good food combine to produce somewhere truly iconic. We were two for a relatively sober business dinner. Soft shell crab was beautiful, pork cheek quite good, black cod as good as ever. Epic wine list. The food is quite good but you will remember the view after the food is forgotten
5
Read very mixed reviews about the service at Ku De Ta so we were unsure whether to gamble our last night on Honeymoon here but Im so glad we did, we had a reservation for 7pm (to return table at 9pm) and from the moment we arrived we were treated so well. We got the outdoor edge table we requested which had the most amazing view of Singapore, the staff were attentive but we never felt rushed, we were given great advice on dishes and didnt get the impression staff were just trying to sell the most expensive thing on the menu. Alcohol is so expensive in Singapore but I didnt think Ku De Ta was massively over priced, it wasnt much more expensive that the drinks we got at Clarke Quay. All in all for the money we paid we had an amazing night and would definetly return
5
My wife and I went for late dinner with our 2 children (7 years and 4 years) on a Friday night to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Given a very good table with a clear view of the sea. Our kids were excited no end. Patrick attended to us. His service was attentive and personal. Was pleasantly surprised when he offered us a complimentary dessert with happy anniversary wishes at the end of the meal, after he realised we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. Wife, in particular, liked the food. The scallops and foie gras were great
5
Had a great night out with my friends last night, and it was one of the best nights out we ever had in a long time. Thank you Fabio and team for the amazing service that made our night so perfect. We will surely be back again, and Thank you Ku De Ta for the super awesome experience! <
5
We came here obviously to see the fantastic views and we werent disapointed, service was a bit slow until i asked for the champagne list then the service iproved, we had a lovelly bottle of bubbly looking over at the view, would i stay here,robably not but would go back for drinks and food again. Very memorabl
5
My husband and I love the experience each time we dine here. The vibe is great, setting always upbeat, and the food is actually very delectable! And the service - in the midst of labour shortage here in Singapore for wait staff, Ku De Ta scores high with their very cheerful and friendly service personnel. They are attentive, quick, knowledgeable, on the beat and with such infectious personalities and smiles - all hardly rude nor pretentious unlike some reviews here (perhaps it was the customer who was rude and surly first??). Led by larger-than-life manager Simon McKinless, everyone seems to enjoy making the restaurant tick. This place is hardly unknown nor obscure - one just does not simply happen to 'stumble upon it'. And with well over 1290 reviews, the most in Singapore I suspect, I can't imagine why people would come here for all the wrong reasons. And then complain. So, to set some things straight -1. The restaurant is not a stuffy (snooty), quiet, grand, fine-dining establishment. Go elsewhere for that. It is fun, hip and a great place to have a good time.2. Not all tables are by the 'edge' where you can have unobstructed views, especially if you are not out in the terrace. 3. Orders are for sharing (mostly for two), infused with Japanese/Asian elements. The portions are not of family proportions - it's designed so that one can sample many different dishes, tapas-style. And it all tastes fantastic!4. The prices - it's not cheap (how would it be 57 stories up one of Singapore's most iconic landmark and top-end hotel? Duh!!), but it's not over the top either. In fact, it's reasonable and more importantly, the innovative and interesting flavours in the food do justice to the price. Mid to higher-end restaurants in Singapore do charge around $40 - $50 for 3 fine pieces of lamb, or $35 for a main dish of pork cheeks (check out Esquina, The Black Swan, etc - all tapas-style places). So why the gripe?5. It is popular and crowded, even on weekdays, which attests to its ability to draw returning customers. Add upbeat music (okay, albeit a bit too loud) to the atmosphere, it's not a place you want to bring your 100-year-old grandma, unless she is hip too! Nor have a serious, all-important business dinner discussion.6. Oh, did I forget the view?? For us, once you've done your 'oohs' and 'aahs' at the vista, you settle in and are actually more impressed with the restaurant itself and what it has to offer (unlike a lot of people who say to come only for the view, not anything else).7. So - be there, or be square!Thank you again Simon for taking care of us, and kudos to your entire team
5
Enjoyed a fine meal, with a spectacular view. Thank you Leo for service that was unobtrusive and still 6 Star....

We visited Ku De Ta on our last night of a 6-week overseas trip in Europe during our stopover on the way home.We arrived about an hour before sunset for a drink at the bar and to soak in the view. We had a very clear evening and could see across Singapore to Malaysia and Indonesia. The sunset was spectacular and brought with it a welcome cool breeze and drop in temperature. Shortly after we enjoyed a laser light show over the city and water. The view is just spectacular.We then went into the restaurant for dinner. We were not disappointed given the price - yes it is expensive. The food was fantastic; we enjoyed a shared meal of lamb, scallops, prawns and pork belly. The accompanying vegetables were also superb and the wine a perfect addition. Dessert was equally delicious. The service was excellent.Perfect for a special occasion or treat and will remember this great night for a long time as one of the highlights of our tri

During our holiday with friends that live in Singapore we were privileged enough to go to dinner at KU DE TA Restaurant, Singapore. I would have to say that this would have been the best ever dining experience. From the moment we walked in the awesomeness of the nite began to unfold, our hostess who showed us to the outdoor deck with the most amazing views of the Gardens by the Bay to Ulysses our waiter who was absolutely amazing nothing was too hard or unachievable. It was our friends birthday and she was made to feel like a queen with a complimentary bottle of bubbles from our hostess to an individually selected cheese cake desert as a birthday cake from Ulysses. Thank yo
5
We highly recommend Ku De Ta. The view was amazing. Even my three year old son cant hide his enthusiasm when he saw the view. The food is superb. Our waiter Arlan was attentive and helpful. Offered some stuff for my child to play. Definitely a great experience
5
This is a once in a lifetime sort of place. The view really is priceless, the food is really very good (sticky squid is a must have), and the staff are great, but it is expensive. But in my view, with the memories you take a way, worth every penn
5
I would highly recommend Ku De Ta if you're in Singapore. The service was excellent, our waiter Leo was lovely - friendly and very helpful. We had the set menu which was all amazing; highlights for me were the soft shell crap and the dessert had the most beautiful mint ganache I have ever tasted. The views are incredible, and that along with the atmosphere, food and attentive staff made for a very memorable evening
5
I took 3 of my children with me. We were of course gob smacked by the views. We had very attentive service from Ken. He suggested the correct plates and amount to order for the children and was always attentive to our needs. We had three set plates plus some extras. The food was delicious as was the wine list.
4
Well I was there with my wife during summer time, first I was in shorts and they told me that I had to change it as you cannot get in with shorts on. Since Singapore is very small I was back in 20 minutes, went to the 92nd floor as far as I remember and was amazed by the beautiful view. It's a very nice place, the only problem is that they are very limited in high tables overlooking the view so we had to share a table with two or three people which were nice but drunk! I know this story wouldn't affect my review, BUT i think they have to add more tables. It wasn't very expensive, two drinks for 110 dollars. It was a nice experience but I'm not sure whether I would go back again
5
Oh yeeeeees. You have to go here. This is expensive but an experience to savour, to enjoy and to make it last as long as possible. A deep pocket will help, but skip dinner two nights before and save the money for your evening here, you will love this experience. Sitting on the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands, an open air dining experience, with views over the city and the bays in Singapore. An extensive wine list and a quite unusual menu but something for everyone. I don't want say too much to spoil the sense of expectation, you will make up your own mind, just set aside the whole evening, fill your wallet and enjoy. You won't regret it

Went hear for my partners birthday and were pretty disappointed. Had the dinner tasting menu with wines for two the bill was SGD640. Locals had told us it was expensive, but we hoped that it would be something special, but sadly we were wrong. The positives: wine was good, first course was good especially the oyster with rose jelly. The big problem is that the rest of the courses didn't really go together especially with the wines. For example, very good lamb but with a sugary sauce which did not work especially with the wine. Cod with a sweat covering which was terrible as we could not even tell if the cod was good quality or not. The desert: mint, chocolate, orange and coriander!! Fruit and mint does not go together. This is all basic stuff which they failed on. I don't know what they were trying to achieve, but some of the flavour combinations were pretty laughable and did not do the quality of the ingredients justice
5
Visit this place on the last days of our honeymoon and we have to admit that is was awesome 👍😄. The view, food, service... Everything. Highly Recommended. Beside the price $350 for 2, but for this place is acceptable.
4
The Ohmi Sirloin was the best and most of all, the food reflect both culinary tradition and creativity.
5
My experience of this restaurant was nothing short of amazing. Michael the sommelier is extremely knowledgeable about their wines. Food is top quality and very well presented. Ambience is lovely with the breath taking view of Singapore. I will definitely come back!
5
This restaurant was just wonderful. Situated on the 57th floor of the unique hotel Marina Bay Sands. Since we entered the restaurant it was all a unique experience, the view, the service, Dj with great chillout music, late night going to more party music.
3
The title says it all. I would not recommend this restaurant for a simple reason. It is poor value for money (Singapore $100 per person, not including alcohol). All I had was a salad, a main course, a bottle of sparkling water and a side dish of mushrooms to go with the main course.Neither the sald, nor the main course was the most expensive entree on the menu
5
Having been in Singapore for a week with my family I spent my last day having dinner at KU DE TA- what a way to end my trip! It was fantastic. Attentive service, refined and inventive cuisine, superb wine. We spent a wonderful evening in this restaurant with a great view of the city.The wine complemented the meal very well and we really enjoyed the food.That is a unforgettable experience in Singapore. Ant the staff services Harry and Ivo were exceptionally polite and extremely helpful and attentiveThey are nice and helpful.
5
If you are looking for an amazing diner and experience with good friends in Singapore it is the place to go! Atmosphere, food and view was great! Superb service from Michael the Sommelier who looked well after us throughout the entire diner! Rita the hostess was also very helpful to bring us to the lounge after dinner! A bit pricey but it worth it once in a while... ;-
5
Just wanted to share what an incredible time we had at the Rooftop Lounge/Bar of Ku De Ta in Marina Bay Sands last Saturday, June 7, where my friends from all over Asia and I celebrated a special reunion. The view is priceless and is a "must-see" for anyone visiting (or living) in Singapore and can't think of a better place to watch the sunset, take in Singapore's vibrant skyline and enjoy the delicious cocktails with dearest friends. The staff were all so courteous, accommodating, and offered impeccable service. Most of all, i only have praises, gratitude and highest regard for Raquel Alfaro who was very kind, friendly and personable and did everything she could to make us feel more than welcome and made sure we had everything we needed to make our reunion so special and memorable! Thank you, Raquel, we will definitely come back and bring more friends
4
Instead of paying $20 to access viewing deck put it toward a cocktail and get view for free! Food was ok. Good flavors but not served hot. Service was exceptional. Would try again but best value is the bar and soaking up that view at sunset
1
The restaurant is stunning! situated on the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel overlooking Singapore. Nice atmosphere if a bit busy, friendly service and lovely staff, but once you are served, they dissapearThe down side, our food took a long time to come and the steak that we ordered came freezing cold, I eventually contacted the waiter and the steak was taken away to be re-heated. The steak came back soaked in oil obviously to stop the meat drying out in the microwave and still cold, teasteless and inedibleStunning Views, nice staff, long wait and the most dissapointing meal that I had around Singapore......so.....back to our hotel for a decent meal
5
For people who love the extraordinary, not the normal traditional brunch, this is the perfect place. Lovely staff (special thanks to Arnie who made our brunch a perfect one)
4
one of the best view point of the city.
have recently shifted to Singapore, and this was the first place that me and my husband visited. A glass of wine and fresh breeze..was a lovely experience
5
We took visitors from Australia and they were amazed. We had been for the view and for the cocktails but it was our first time eating at Ku De Ta. We were a party of 4 celebrating a birthday and chose the chef's tasting menu.(Per Person SGD$168++) Every dish was incredible. In particular the cod. Our servers were Patrick and Azlin. They took great care of us. Explaining every dish and even getting the kitchen to do an extra special personalised desert plate for the birthday girl. Try the Tony Stark Pepper cocktail. YUM
4
On Thursday 22nd May Vincent gave my family and I a warm welcome as we settled down in the comfy lounge enjoying the city view. On a warm day it was a great way to have a memorable rest from our walk around 'Gardens by the Bay'. Although we were a little dishevelled from our walk we didn't get any snobbery from the staff, but great service. It was really appreciated
5
We went there to avoid the skydeck tourism frenzy. Had a table reserved for weekend brunch. Yes, it is a little pricey, but the food was just excellent - not a buffet or typical breakfast which you might expect, but a well selected choice of asian-inspired dishes. Kids ate free. Good service, and the view atop Singapore came for free! Just great. Would always return
5
We took our friends from the UK to Ku De Ta last week and had an amazing time. The service of the team led by Simon McKinless was faultless - from the drinks at the bar (some fantastic cocktails - one recommended to our friend by the bartender which was amazing), to the way we were looked after at the table. The restaurant could sell itself on the views alone, but the food was also so good - and the menu approach meant that we could share a number of plates around the group. The dinner was well placed, the wine list good value for a top end restaurant. Enjoyed it so much we are back tonight with some more friends that are visiting - can't wait....
4
I didn't really have any expectations so that may be a good thing. we went for an early lunch at 12pm so it wasnt full but needed to reserve a few days before.we had the set lunch, one of which was a bento box. I guess it was a little pricey since you are paying for the view. but I found the food to be tasty and fresh and light and just rightly seasoned.service was good. staff were attentive enough and not hovering
5
Our first visit at KuDeTa was a total disaster (read our previous comment from last year if you want to know why). So it was with a little pain in our stomach that we finally decided to give it a second chance for Erni's birthday after we learned that the manager had changed. We were not disappointed at all. The staff was amazing, the food was excellent and the view, well the view remains breathtaking. Well done to this amazing hotel for having taken into consideration our critics. The manager change was definitely for the best. We will be back soon! (Pics and more: follow us on FB and Twitter
4
Pretty average Japanese fusion food (nice rolls, but rice was too soggy and overlooked, and some rolls were trying too hard - one with fois gras just tasted very mushy). Tempura was good, but a little too oily as the batter was too heavy and doughy. Service was very friendly, but too many covers being served by too few staff. Fantastic views - which is the best feature of this place.
5
had a some snacks and wine with my wife at the Kudeta outdoor bar area.had one of the most fascinating view in Singapore even tho the drinks were little bit expensive than average.Generally had a great time also was very impressed with the service manager Fabio was very kind and friendly. definitely suggest you to visit when you are in singapore
5
That was a night to remember - special thanx to Maurice & Zac for the lovely service, will definitely visit again, Amazing view, food and service - keep it up guys, all the very best from Iromica & Sakuntha from Sri Lanka

It is a must in Singapour. Expensive but you will love the food,drinks,service and view. Dessert was my favorite part. Dishes are made to share so you can adjust your budget and try few dishes.

Great place to bring foreign guests as the view is absolutely stunning, especially towards evening. Food is above average but considering that you do not need to pay for the view, it is worth it.

My husband and I are presently on a world cruise and we just had a stop in Singapore so we decided to go for lunch at this fabulous and unique looking hotel the "Marina Bay Sands". There is a stand in the Lobby where you can make your reservation. The restaurant is located on the 57th floor and the view is absolutely speechless. Also, the design of the restaurant is very contemporary, beautiful, in the light grey color, super clean and zen with beautiful hot pink orchids. We chose the lunch special degustation menu which was 58$ each plus two glasses of wine from their lunch special wine list for 15$ each. The meal was fantastic, delicate taste put together and crispy fresh. The portions were not to big but not too small so you feel like you had enough for your money but you are not too full. The presentation is very nice, especially for the dessert plate. The service was perfect, discrete and polite, exactly what you would expect from a world renowned Asian restaurant. Absolute loved it and recommend it to any food lovers

The view and the menu we choosed was amazing.Its just annoying, that the front desk Lady told us 3 times before we booked, that we need to pay at least amount X and we are not allowed to come in sneakers
3
I've not been to Ku De Ta for a while. It was the place where we routinely took all of our out-of-town guests for drinks and dinner. The view is the main attraction. The service is what I've now come to expect in Singapore - prompt and dispassionate. Unfortunately, the prices are also what I have come to expect in Singapore: high and without justification. You must go at least once. Beyond that, I guess it depends on your experience

Marina Bay Sands is the crown of Singapore attractions and Ku De Ta is the jewel that sits on top of that crown.As a local, this is the place I frequent with guests from overseas to give them an overview of the city. Perched on the roof top deck on the 57th floor next to the now legendary infinity-edged pool of the MBS, the view from the restaurant and the outdoor bar is nothing less than breathtaking. You can a full panoramic view of the city and on a clear day, you can literally look across the whole country and see Malaysia in the horizon.Usually with venues boasting roof top venues, the food plays second fiddle. However, with Ku De Ta, I found the Japanese inspired fusion dining experience both novel and delightful. With dishes served communal style, you get a soft introduction to oriental style dining. Lunch is particularly good value. You get quite a nice breath and variety in a Bento box and you will be surprised how affordable this is - just a little more than the ticket price up to the Skypark! Dinner is a little more costly but not exorbitant. Drinks on the other hand is quite astronomically priced. Be prepared to shell out US$13 for a 25cl beer and over US$20 for a cocktail.If it is any validation on its quality and prospects, the private equity arm of LVMH recently acquired a majority stake in Ku De Ta. Definitely a must visit place for any visitor to singapore in my books
3
It is a great place to chill out and have a drink, especially the spectacular view of Singapore's night city. It may be slightly pricy as it is a hotel bar. So it should be expected... The sunset view is nice too. However, i feel that it is a place more for tourists and locals wouldn't really visit as I personally feel that its for the price of the view instead of the food and drinks. But it's worth visiting if you are a tourist
5
This was perhaps our 7th visit to Ku De Ta and it was not just as good, it was even better than the previous ones. Michael Leitner, their sommelier, is so spot on on his recommendations and with his wealth of knowledge, it is a pleasure to talk to him and to feel so welcomed. We had last night an amazing lady looking after us, her name was Lilly, and she was very friendly, warm and explained every single dish with expertise. They made us feel right at home that when the time to leave came, no one at our table wanted to.Thanks guys for an amazing evening
4
My newly wed wife and I had a sunset dinner upstairs. Prices are high here as you'd expect; you pay for the view and the service. I felt the food was worth the price, however drink prices seemed excessive, even for this type of venue (though they were doing a promotion deal on a Champagne which was worthwhile).Arlan, our waitperson, we particularly good. He overheard us talking about our honeymoon and organised a special treat for us
5
Had a wonderful dinner with my Wife last week. The food was fabulous but a bit over priced, the service staff were warm and friendly, the view is AMAZING.
Thank you guys, keep it up. Will definitely come back here soon.
5
I had dinner here during the weekend: the food was fabulous.They had great selection of food to choose from. Staffs were friendly and great service: Fabio, the Manager, is really the best..... Will definitely come back here. Ettore
4
First of all, the view is hard to put into words. We were there after dark and the Singapore skyline is beautiful. Service was good; we arrived about 15 to 20 minutes early, but they seated us right away. There are so many choices on the menu, but the portions are substantial and most everything is a la carte, so we shared several different dishes. Pricey, but a wonderful treat on our last night in Singapore
4
didnt even have the slightest idea that there was a restaurant on the roof top of Marina Bay Sands. I know there is a pool and a party club but never expected an upmarket restaurant. I was told that there is a minimum expected spend.Luckily we were 5 of us and in 1 order, i guess we surpassed it :) ...I would say the premium is for the crowd that comes in and the view. the view is fantabolisticsupermindbloggingawesome. its just drinks all the way and nothing good i could find to eat (though the menu runs into couple of pages). will definately revisit with family and friends. A must visit
4
My wife and i celebrated our 34th Wedding Anniversary at the Ku De Ta on May 15. The staff were hospitable esp. Leo our Filipino waiter. They did not mind our request for taking pictures and when they found out it was our anniversary they even made our dinner truly memorable. The view was beautiful since it was in the early evening and we there was (blood) red moon that night too. We had the rib eye and tenderloin and it was delicious and of course the bottle of champagne, the especially made dessert, etc. highly recommended if you're in Singapore and if you're celebrating a very special occassion. Expensive but hey it's worth it!
3
Popped up in the lift for cocktails around lunchtime and were lucky to be seated quite quickly, as another party had just left. Normally wouldn't have splashed out as students, but it was our last day in Asia and we wanted it to be memorable. Waiting staff were unattentive, likely because we didn't look like we had money, and slow to take our order. Refused on principle to pay to access the viewing area and managed to nab this photo using just a telephoto lens. Drinks were expectedly overpriced but quite strong. Not sure I would have returned for dinner even if my student budget could stretch to it with the staff being so absent
1
Still in shock with how totally rude the staff are!!! After spending well over 2000 SGD I asked very politely where the bathroom was before we left, 3 staff members pointed me in a complete opposite direction telling me I had to leave the restaurant, go past the elevators and down some stairs, then realising I couldn't go there unless I paid.. I was also standing around for about 5 minutes looking very confused and no one tried to point me in the right direction, so very annoyed came back to our table and asked my friend to show me where the bathroom was and it was just inside from where the first staff member I asked was. In 30 years I've been alive I have never known anyone to be so rude
2
We visited late in the arvo mid week for some late lunch and drinks. When we arrive we were told we would have to be off the couches by 4pm which was fine. It took 15 mins before any of the staff acknowledged us! We had to continuously flag them down to get service. Another staff member came over to tell us we had to get off the couch by 3.45pm now.... One of the three meals was brought out with the rest of us sitting around watching them eat. After 10 mins and the meal now eaten, we struggled to find a staff member to see where our other two meals were. They then took their time and came back 10 mins later with the club sandwiches which were average at best. Just after the trainee (with orange sunglasses and trainee badge) brought the meals at 3.25pm, he then proceeded to tell us we had to get off the lounge. My friend mentioned to him that he had just given us our meals so how can he expect us to leave. He didnt response and left - obviously very keen to move us along at Ku De Ta!Overall a disappointing visit and simply the worst service I received in Singapore. I won't be rushing back to the bar side of this place any time soon
5
The concierge at our hotel got us a 9:30 reservation last minute and I think we ended up with the best table in the house. It was on the ocean side upper level right next to the edge and had the most amazing view. We had the fillet, ribeye, and tuna all were cooked absolutely perfect and had great flavor. The staff was amazing as well the young lady did an amazing job most of the time I didn't even know she was there until there was new food in front of me or my water was filled that had just been empty

So like just about everyone else who visits Singapore these days, the big spaceship in the sky (The marina Bay Sands) loomed over everything and it seemed an intriguing idea to go to the bar and restaurant at the top- Ku De Ta. Now , one expects the nose bleed prices at this height and our group was well aware of this and we booked a month in advance for dinner. We met at the bar first- and honestly we didn't need to concerned at all with spending loads of money because in an hour we were only just able to order one round of drinks such was the abominable service. Then we waited over 30 minutes for our dinner table (we booked a month ahead for our table of 8) and then another 20 minutes to be handed a menu or asked for drinks. No the place wasn't completely rushed off its feet either. From the moment we sat down til our tapas style food arrived it was 90 minutes. After we ate- didn't take long - we tried to order more food...and drinks- and over an hour later got no joy! So really being steed for almost two hours with one drink and some small tapas plates and no one coming to help us we decided to go. (Plenty of other places to eat in Singapore, worthy of our time!) As soon as we asked for the bill, the waiter then told us we 'hadn't spent the minimum and we had to keep ordering until we did. We asked to see the manager. Another person arrived, didn't introduce themselves and again insisted we order more. We asked to see the manager. The person then identified themselves as the manager and we explained the situation. The manager apologised but then made a big show of 'allowing us' to leave without paying the minimum. Yes. Really. There is not one reason to come here other than to be curious about the view. So do that- come and see the view and then walk right o back to the elevators and go somewhere that actually cares
3
If the height doesn't give you a nose bleed, the prices will. We went home hungry as the dishes are tiny and expensive. Hard to get served at the bar too. Not an enjoyable experience to be honest
4
My husband and I had dinner at Ku De Ta in April whilst spending a couple of days in Singapore.The ambience is just right - lighting, music, buzz. All matched by the stunning panoramic views over Singapore. We were delighted that the quality of the food matched the surroundings - beautiful menu with a Japanese influence. Everything we tried was exquisite, as was the champagne and wine suggested to us. Service was perfect. A really memorable night, would recommend to anyone
2
We went here for our 1st wedding anniversary dinner.We were greeted with disappointment because we were told that we could not access part of the bar area which has the best views because there was a private function ongoing.Correct me if I am wrong, but a lot of people go here for taking in the views if the Singapore skyline.We had booked our dinner more than a week in advance, and nothing was mentioned about the limited access, so I feel like I've been cheated.We were given a not so comfortable sofa type table outside. While having the starters I noticed an army of fire ants across our table (lighting in the entire restaurant is abysmal).We were promptly moved indoors.The meal itself was quite ordinary. I think I heard something about this restaurant being a Michelin star (maybe I am wrong). Maybe I am not refined enough to appreciate the flavours, but in my opinion the food was very ordinary.We wanted some sea food fried rice, but they only offered a veg fried rice and a non-veg style. We had the non-veg version and there were a few bits of egg in it.The duck we had was too rare and the halibut was extremely sweet and doused in butter.The California roll was good.The quality of service was good, no complaints about that.Drinks are reasonably priced, considering it is 57 floors above Singapore.Walking around the restaurant I noticed more people drinking than eating. On our way there our cab driver mentioned that he and his colleagues from another job had been here for a party once and spent 3000 SGD, mostly on alcohol.If alcohol is your thing then this might be the place for you to live it up.I expected a lot more from the experience and was quite disappointed.If the management want ideas then go to Potato Head Beach Club in Bali and experience what I would have expected
5
My partner came across the restaurant while browsing online.We had the tasting menu and although this was a lot of good would recommend this to anyone.The atmosphere and service was outstanding. If you go to any restaurant while in Singapore make it this one.
5
Had a wonderful dinner with my bestie. The service staff, Leo, and the hostess, Raikal (hope i spelt it correctly) were both warm and friendly. I felt at home with them. Thank u, guys! The food was great but we felt it's a'lil over priced. Anyway, we were bowled over by the breathtaking view and pampering service. My day was completed with a wide smile! :) Hey guys... Watch out for my return! Cya soon.
1
25 minutes after we entered the bar we finally got a drink. 1 minute later we got our bill.The staff are completely overwhelmed here and the bar staff almost incompetent. One guy in a white shirt yelling orders to 3 guys in black shirts whilst customers jostle for service. Appalling especially for the extortionate pricing. Oh and if you want to sit it will cost you $Sin 200. My recommendation is go for the view, take your pictures then leave
5
A night to remember! Excellent, best quality food, thoughtful service and personal assistance gives you the impression to be something special. Ok, you probably shouldn't think about the $ you are just about to spend but you really get a hell of specialties in return.We had the ohmi sirloin tataki meal which was delicious! Razor-thin special meat that melts on your tongue. Tip: if you struggle with the compilation of the menue, the before and after drinks and / or the wine that suits best... just ask for Azlin. She was our waitress for the evening and without any doubt the reason why our stay turned from very good to excellent. Invisible when not needed but always around when we had a question or a wish. Thanks Azlin

We had a Birthday celebration for a friend at KU DE TAH and had the most fabulous evening! We all chose the tasting menu. It was delicious! The staff were efficient and friendly. And then we had Cocktails at the bar outside â€¦ a bit busy but managed to bag ourselves a spot with a view and WOW! Well worth a visit a must do when in Singapore
5
I have eaten here several times and has always been a fantastic evening. It is difficult to find great food, excellent service and an amazing view in one restaurant but Ku de Ta consistently shows it can be done. Perfect venue for out of town guests or a special occasion
5
Went here for my daughters 21st, most of us had the taster menu which was fantastic, but there was plenty to choose from. Wine as always in Singapore was pricey but there was a special on for the house champers and as it was a special occasion we went fro that.Great food and a very profesional and attentive staff, great selection of cocktails at the bar and we had a view of the F1 track being set up
5
I had an incredible meal at Ku De Ta with the best view of Singapore. My server Ken could not have been better. I recommend it to everyone visiting Singapore.
5
Apsolutley amazing expirience. Great Dj ,beautiful view and great choice of wines. What else to ask for ?? Fabulous !!!!

When we tried to make a reservations for 9, we got this really unfriendly and arrogant lady who gave the impression that she was too good for this job. She kept repeating that the table was only able to accommodate 10, so 'NOT MORE THAN 10'. I swear she said that about 4 times to me. And instead of 'requesting' for my credit card details for deposit (at SGD 50 per person), she practically demanded for it with a threat that I will lose SGD 450 if we don't show. What an awful person she was! I nonetheless proceeded with the reservations because the plans were already made to dine there,When we showed, we had a surprise extra visitor and luckily we had a wonderful waiter who found the solution for us. He seated the 4 kids at a table next to us. That's what we expect, accommodating and creative service. The kids enjoyed themselves and the adults could dine in peace.The food was of a high quality and served beautifully. The King prawn Tempura, the crispy squid and pork were all fantastic! Foodwise, it was perfect. The view too is sensational and the waiter that served us was very good too (I think his name was Zac, not sure)
2
We returned back to Ku De Ta a couple of weeks ago to experience their magnificent weekend brunch. However, we were so disappointed. Gone were all the beautiful dishes to choose from, what was left was a quite boring fixed menu not worth the price at all. Gone was also the self service buffet, and the dessert buffet was not what I remembered it to be. There are many better places to have weekend brunch in Singapore than this
3
I visited Ku De Ta with my family during our last visit to Singapore. It was my parents first time to Singapore, so naturally we had to visit the top of the Sands. We tried to go the night prior, however we were told at the elevator that no children were allowed after 6pm, so we settled for lunch the next day. Obviously not kid friendly. The food was very nice, and very expensive. We all had a great meal with various sushi and seafood dishes, and enjoyed the wonderful view. Service was a bit slow, but nothing terrible considering we were enjoying the $19 SGD beers and the scenery. Biggest issue is the cost, and being told after spending $295 SGD on lunch we could not enter the "view point" because we did not have a pass. All together, if you justify it as $30 per person for the view and then lunch, it is worth it. Just for the food, it is too expensive. I will not return and would recommend others to go up for a drink and leave
5
We arrived late at Marina Bay Sands Hotel- so after the great unpack we decided to find a place to eat at the Hotel. This restaurant is amazing! The staff greeting us were very helpful and obliging. They readily explained the menu to us and offered suggestions. We decided on the tasting menu, in which we shared 9 courses- most were tasting size, except for the main, which was most ample and slowed us down. The dessert was on indivual plates, and was delicious. We were attended to regularly with our drinks and water refilled when required. We could not fault the excellent food and service. Our waitress Sithra, was exceptionally polite and extremely helpful and attentive. Thank you to all who gave us our first Singapore dining experience. We would highly recommend this place to all visitors, because apart from the food, the roof top ambience and view is relaxing and spectacular
1
We have been in the restaurant with 4 people (it was a buisness dinner). From the beginning, you have the felling, that they would like only your money... I will get the information from the beginning, that you have approx. 2 hours in restaurant, and than you must leave. What? If I spent a lot of money in a restaurant, I would like to stay as long as I want. The most people guess, that you have an amazing view from the restaurant. That's wrong! The most tables are in the middle of the restaurant, and than you will see nearly nothing. Also if you have a window table, you will see not really much, because of the other people who are standing in front of the window! The dinner: It is ok, but really not special. You will find a lot of other, much better restaurants in Singapore. By the why, we spent there 1,500 SGD for 4 persons (including wine). I guess, for that amount of money, you can definitively eat better in Singapore. After that, we go to the bar and drink another 2 cocktails per person (so, in total 8 cocktails for another 250 SGD -> Yes, it is really expensive).So, if you would like to go there, you should calculate minimum 200 SGD per Person. I guess, only if you order a bottle of champagne or expensive wine, you will get a good service. So, if you drink only beer, you will feel it in the service.The worst experience from the evening: Also from the bar, you don't have a really good viewing. For the good viewing, you must go one level down over the stairs to the observation desk... We guess, no problem: Let's go down! Too early: There was a person from the KU DE TA who exlained us really unfriendly, that we must buy a ticket for the observation desk. We must go down with the elevator, buy a ticket and come up again... I explained her, that we have spent now approx. 1,750 SGD in her restaurant, and I guess, this should be included! The reaction was: Look on the rules, there it is clearly mentioned. Take it or leave it...We leave it and go to another bar... So, the complete staff is really arrogant and the food is too expensive for that quality. So, don't go there.If you would like a restaurant which is really good and has a nice viewing, you should try the Equinox in the Swissotel Stamford. Much better and a better viewing for a normal amount of money!

This is being considered by the locals as one of the "MUST BEEN" restaurant. It is located on top of the Marina Bay SANDS Hotel, one of the only two hotels in Singapore operates Casinos. The location, beverages, food, ambience, services......are all of the top end level, so are the prices. However, the visit to the restaurant will bring visitors to nearly the same level of the Sky Park and save the entrance cost for the Sky Park. It is best to visit early evening, so one can enjoy the beautiful sunset on top of Singapore; and the city lights which will be on by dusk. The transportation is very good: public buses, MRT (Mass Rapid Transport), taxis...all around. However, the restaurant was bought over by the L Capital, an arm of the French LVMH group early 2014. BON APPETITE 
5
Whenever you come to Singapore you must go to KU DE TA. Belongs to world best Restaurants. excellent asian Fusion Food, wonderful wines, great Service, spectacular views on Skyline. A must visit in Marine Sandy Bay Hotel, the Icon of Singapore Close to spectacular views on Gardens with amazing Scene. Please make Reservation in time, very difficult to get a place
2
Made a reservation online 2 weeks prior to arrival, and I specifically requested "Outdoor Seating" for 2 pax so as to have unobstructed panoramas of the skyline. BUT when we arrived, we were given a table and 2 chairs seated INDOORS where the place was CRAMPED in one designated area where they place couples (2 people at 1 table) together. Asked about the vacancy of outdoor seating, the waiter said there was a possibility that it might rain. Tsk. 45 minutes to 1 hour later, there was NO RAIN. After finishing main course, waiter asked about dessert. I said I'd like to be seated outdoors where I can enjoy the view, or else I'll skip dessert and leave. That wish was granted where we finished our dessert and relished in the panoramic views of the landscapes for the last 20mins before leaving. So much for food that tastes just average
5
Our man who served us, Yul, was great!!' Smile all the way, EXCELENT service, and A perfect night in Singapore! This is A must!!!!
4
It's a nice restaurant with Asian cuisine, located at marina Bay sands level 57 with the beautiful view of Singapore. Foods and beverages menu is satisfying, with a good service from their staffs especially Ken.
Only dislike is it just too noisy.
4
Great place, a must to do in Singapore, great to chill on the roof and drink cocktails. Pricey but not bad and really worth it.
3
It's absolutely one of the best views you can get in Singapore staff is very average and not so helpful food is expensive and tastes average but worth one visit.
4
What is there to be said. Everything is awesome. The party... the drinks. And yes! The view! Thank you guys!
4
We went for our first wedding anniversary we were first positioned inside very squeezed in with no view, we asked to move which was not a problem and well worth the move the atmosphere outside is much better than inside we also said it was our anniversay and our waiter arlan Valdez bought us a really nice desert Arlan was very good and explained everything in terms of the food and experience. We really had a pleasAnt night the food wasn't the greatest the starters were fantastic (california roll/ squid/ beef) the main was just ok. The overall evening was very good and we would visit again
5
I took my husband for his 50th birthday celebration and it was amazing! The views are breathtaking! We were seated by a wonderful waiter called Fabio who provided us exceptional service. Our meals were of fine dining standard as we ordered the grilled salmon and scallops for mains. These dishes were amazing. We received complimentary cake for my husband's birthday celebration which was a chocolate pudding with ice cream and marshmallows followed by coffee. Fabio arranged this which we greatly appreciated. This evening will be remembered as one of our dining experiences ever! Mary and Eva
4
This was a birthday meal and Ku De Ta did not disappoint! The setting is spectacular, the food very good and the service excellent throughout! Ryan our table waiter was particularly helpful and attentive. We felt spoiled throughout! Yes this is an expensive restaurant but for special occasions it more than fits the bill. We will certainly return
5
Vincent was the person serving my family and he had good suggestions for food, because I had braces on, and was mindful of the intention to share. He paid good attention to the table so I appreciated that.The minimum spending was high but was good in a way that I didn't hesitate to order some of the recommends and the expensive food you will only get at such restaurants.Foie gras, ribeye, Hokkaido scallops, aubergine were fantastic. I had the iberico pork cheeks which were cooked v well and I could chew with newly fitted braces.Fantastic experience
2
Even before getting into the lift , we were approached by the lady at the entrance , who to say it nicely had a lack of good manners surprising for the type of place, rest of service was at same level. Food only average, so if you like the view just go for a drink, restaurant not really worth a visit
4
Went here with our kids for sunday brunch. Really yummy and a fantastic setting. Yes, its expensive but worth it!
5
Staff were excellent, attentive and couldn't do enough for us. We were given an outside table as requested and even a couple of complimentary dishes for our honeymoon.
All our food was excellent and priced well, we would recommend and visit again.
5
Leo was superb in looking after our dinner table, the service was excellent. Kudos to the entire team too..
5
superb service, great food, nice view, international cusine asian served, innovative but a bit pricy.
3
Without doubt the best view of Marina Bay there is. The food, however, is decidedly average and extremely expensive. One of those places to dine at (once) for the experience.
5
We just went there to have a drink with a view at sunset. As the cocktails were excellent and the overall atmosphere was great, we mentioned to our attentive and nice barkeeper (his name was Sandeep) that we would like to have dinner here. He immediately took care of it, and just a few minutes later we got a table outside as we wished for! Also here the staff was kind and caring, a house DJ was playing great music, everything was "just right". We both love Asian cuisine, so we enjoyed the excellent food and Chilean red wine. A farewell drink at the bar completed a perfect and unforgettable evening..
2
Our experience at Ku De Ta was less than desirable. You really can't fault the view that you get whilst dining at Ku De Ta it really is quite stunning our service was average at best with the waiters more interested in serving the larger groups than a couple trying to have a romantic dinner. As for our food it was either sensational or uneatable.Firstly we ordered a few entrees, the Beef Tataki, arrived first and was simply amazing. Secondly the tempura soft shell crab that was crumbed not tempura and was purely awful, we had to return it as it was very unpleasant. Next arrived the squid which hardly stood out. The mains we ordered where hardly stand out dishes either and our desert fortunately finished our evening on a high. For the price you pay at Ku De Ta go elsewhere yes the view is stunning but I really think singapore has the most amazing food and it's not worth going here paying the money that you do and potentially feeling underwhelmed
5
I came here for my birthday dinner on Sunday night with my boyfriend, and we were very impressed! The flavours were amazing, and the waitress was very informative about every dish it seemed on the menu.The rose champagne was delicious and definitely worth the $40.. Birthday treat! I would come here again for a special occasion as it really is quite something.
5
We would never have expected a meal so good at this somewhat touristy location. It was a blast to go to the top of the Marina Bay Sands for a drink followed by dinner at the KU De Ta restaurant. We had wonderful service from Irene and Vincent who both made the evening so much more enjoyable by their suggestions and attention. Be sure and order the soft shell crabs
4
When entertaining guests from overseas this is definitely the place to take them. Arlan looked after us brilliantly - great service and food although STILL don't like the idea of sharing different plates - have to order a few of each when there are 8 people so adds up $ wise but nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Like the lights attached to the menus -helpful especially for "older" guests. Great views - worth a visit
1
A bit like ku de ta Bali. Food is awful. We arrive in singapore and have come to ku de ta. Had a very expensive meal and were disappointed by the food. We could have had this in the good court downstairs.
4
Good for party,dine in, or even party! Faizal & Jeffry manager is the man! one of my favourite place to hang out =)
5
Its a great place to chillout . Top of the city view. great service. If ur only drinking no snacks can be ordered. Food is only for sit in diners. Aprt from this , its a great place to visit.
5
Was great to see Faizal Noors till in the bar scene and Guiding Me & my guests around the restaurant & Club!
What a great hospitality!
Loving the awesome view from Kudeta!
Not forget the Cocktails & Food!
It's a must to visit there often!
5
What an experience! We entered the Marina Bay Sands and found ourselves greeted And ushered to the lift taking us to the very top and the beautiful sights in Singapore. A breathtaking view and experience to see this amazing city. After a drink at the bar, Leo welcomed us to our table and presented a sumptuous range of exotic menu choices. Being a little overwhelmed he guided us through the menu and wine list. An array of shiitake mushrooms, crunchy fried squid, charcoalGrilled salmon and delicate duck were our perfect choices. This was followed by a unique flavoured garam masala chocolate cake, pannacotta and sorbet! Thank you Leo for your impeccable service! You were so kind and considerate of our experience and we will always remember our first visit to Ku De TA!
4
I was on vacation few weeks back, I heard from my university friends in Malaysia that kudeta is a cool place...it was amazing and no doubt about that and my bartender for that day was Frederick..he was very respectful, attentive and made small talks on comfortable topics..overall it was a nice place to end the day
5
Decided at short notice to have pre-dinner drinks and dinner at Ku De Ta on the first evening of this trip after having it recommended by another passenger on the flight to Singapore. As I was staying in the hotel anyway it was an easy decision and the right one. We were made to feel very welcome by all the staff and the wonderful manager, who gave us a fantastic table with a perfect view. The service was great and the food was fantastic and the view spectacular. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed the evening and I will certainly be heading back there on my next visit to Singapore. Thank you to Simon and the rest of the staff who made the evening memorable

Food very good, but on the small side considering the extreme price!!!. $8 for a glass of soft drink. Again $8 for a small steamed rice as an example.The views are amazing on the plus side. However to get to observation deck you need another pass to get in. Which involved going back down to ground floor to go back to the 57th floor
4
Well if you want to avoid paying to go to the observation deck of the sky park, just go up to Ku De TA and have a ginger ale! I took my cousin and it was fabulous - such a breathtaking view and you can see the people swimming in the famed infinity pool. Good music and drinks are horrendously e pensive but who cares, YOLO

We went here on a Thursday night for my partner's 30th Birthday and it was extremely busy. We had reserved a table - essential, otherwise we wouldn't have got in (we saw people being turned away at the door). We were informed when we booked that there was a $80 SGD min spend for each person, but this isn't difficult as the prices are fairly high.The restaurant was extremely busy and our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived so we had a drink at the bar - my bellini was around $23 SGD and was well made. The views from the outside bar are amazing and there is space to walk around and see different views of the city.We were called to our table about 10 minutes later and found ourselves in the middle of the restaurant - no problem as there are no 'window seats' anyway because the outside bar surrounds the restaurant. Service was prompt and the food was extremely good. The waiters were friendly and helpful - particularly our lovely filipino waiter who played along with our joke and brought out my partner's (fake!) birthday cake with much ceremony at our request. The only negative note is that the music was a little loud on occasions - the music was good but the bass just needed turning down a bit. All in all, quite expensive but a memorable birthday evening

Had lunch here last year for our anniversary.We arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation. Upon entering the hotel tower, we informed the doorman that we had a reservation at Ku De Ta. We were guided to the third tower (only tower to have an access to Ku De Ta) elevator going to the top floor. When we got to the 57th floor, we were offered by the hostess if we would like to wait at the lounge by the vanishing edge pool. We had a glass of Champagne while the server offered to take our pictures. After a few minutes, we were led to the main dining room where we were served our pre-ordered foods. The ambiance was great, the drinks and the foods were what was expected in Fine Dining. Very professional and friendly staff. Our dessert was served at a table at the very edge of the patio where we had a breathtaking view of the Marina and buildings below. One story under us was the viewing deck where most of the tourists enjoy the view. We were treated extra special on our anniversary lunch. Since then, we've always talked about our Ku De Ta dining experience when Fine Dining or Singapore comes up in our conversation.A must see when in Singapore

My wife Nadine and myself are from Belgium and we made an Asia trip trhough the month of March 2014. We went from Shanghai to Hongkong, from there onto the Seadream yacht cruise touring Vietnam from North to South. And from there to Singapore where we finally staid 5 days. What is important for us, and for most of the Belgiums is good quality food, but the Atmosphere is as important. A good dinner in an unpleasant invironment is half so good dining as dining with lovely food, ambiance, view, and very important is the service and friendliness of the staff. Well , on all our trips one restaurant (with lounge bar), is over and above what we feel as the best place to be to enjoy, eat, drink , relax with loungy music, during a perfect dinner. In the Ku De Ta in Singapore. Everything was at top level. Was the food Michelin standard? no. But it was the best food to gi that fits in the total picture. We , just like everybody else, have been super professionaly but casually been treated by the staff , managed by a guy called Ben. He was running a staff of maybe 30 people, talked to the guests, helped where needed , doing dishes if there was a need for. And always friendly. Surprise, the guy is only 23 years old.So, our recommendation when you go to Singapore. Go to the KuDeTa restaurant and enjoy a wonderfull loungy evening with even their private DJ's.Well done guys. You ar definately in our top 3.Jean & Nadine from Belgiu

Fantastic view, delightful music and a great atmosphere. A huge thank you to Ryan (waiter) and Andi (wine sommelier) who accommodated our every need with smiles and friendly conversation. From tuna tartare to steak and a chocolate pudding...accompanied by wine and finished with a barbadillo. I can't fault our evening
5
With a mixture of catching up with great friends, an unbelievable view, and great food this place is hard to beat. We where there with people that had been before so followed their lead and just had everyone order two dishes each plus rice and shared the lot. They all came out in whatever order but as we were sharing this made no difference
2
We arrived at KU DE TA for our 7:30 meal to a room full of screaming kids. Average service (drinks took longer than food!) and a ludicrous 'it's share plates and it comes out as the kitchen makes it' policy which is just an excuse for the kitchen to be lazy and not manage themselves properly. Honestly, I'd expect that at a bogan cafe, not an expensive restaurant although I have heard that elsewhere recently and responded with equal disdain. The food is not too expensive but was bland and boring. Wine is priced outrageously, have a cocktail, they're well priced.Don't get excited by the view,it's OK but you're restricted and the people paying $23 get it better as they can get near the edge (with pesky wait staff asking every. 5 mins what you're doing).Overall I was disappointed as were the tables on either side of us, but KU DE TA will go on and they won't care because they know you'll pay for the hype and the view

Wow, booked ahead, arrived on time in the middle of a downpour but met with surly front door people at the bottom of the lift and officious front desk personnel at the restaurant reception. So requesting special table didn't go far for special occasion and forward booking when a downpour meant everyone else had to squeeze into the indoor area. Hey, weather is out of everyone's control but don't start making allowances.When told, food choices and types are designed to be shared and it arrives when it is cooked in no specific order, sounded a little like a forward apology for poor kitchen organisation.So the food sounded on the menu a lot more exotic than it actually was, it actually tasted quite ordinary. Drinks were exceptionally expensive I.e. Glasses of wine exceed $22, a bottle about 400-500% mark up on same wine back in Australia.Extremely noisy, service hit & miss, no regularity. After reading other reviews, expected to have the same waiter/ress and good planned execution, alas no.So once the meal was over in an hour, being told we had to vacate our 7.30pm booking by 9.30pm, we took a stroll to enjoy this magnificent location. Well, those folks paying $23 to simply go to the observation deck got much better views which restaurant patrons could not get anywhere close to.The purpose of the night to enjoy a special meal in this very special location and enjoy the meal: food under-whelming, prices exorbitant, ability to enjoy the location/view spoiled - so strongly recommend future visitors pay the $23 to get closer to enjoy the entire deck at 57 floors up on a flying boat rather than waste money on the restaurant
2
A fabulous location but unfortunately Ku De Ta relies on this too heavily and has become lazy. There are very few "tables with a view" and these go to the regular patrons, so don't be surprised if you find yourself with a table that could be 'anywhere'. The great service did not compensate for the frankly miserable front-of-house staff (smiles cost nothing ladies!) and only very average food. At this price, in Singapore, a Mecca for foodies, asian food should be excellent and I'm afraid the fayre here only rated good-to-average. You're probably better-off paying to visit the Skypark and eating elsewhere.
5
The ku de ta restaurant on marina sands bay hotel is one of the best meals i have ever had. The service is outstanding and the food quality was amazing. Ask for david as he is a brilliant waiter and will look after the guests to the highest possible standerds

Yes the view is spectacular and watching the sunset with all the ships going east around the bay is nice. I must admit I had some doubt about the food thinking they'll have invested everything in the view and the design at the expense of the kitchen. I was wrong the food was very good and the concept of sharing small dishes is fun. We had some excellent foie gras on eggplant, good crab tempura, beef dices very well cooked, etc. The dishes were quite small though and the bottom line is that it is very expensive. We ate well, had a reasonable bottle of white wine and we spent close to 200SGD per person.What is worth the price? Yes. Will I come back? Only with a client
5
A fast climb to the top, take in the views, some 1500 ships in the harbor, observe the Formula 1 track lay-out for the street night race in September: all these are added values to a great venue atop the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. No problem getting a table, late after noon as the Singapore skyline starts its nightly shine.Community seating promotes interaction and we enjoyed meeting a few expats. This is a great terrace, escape the heat and noise from some 56 floors below: you have arrived at Ku De Ta
4
The view was really nice. The bar was good because they had Hoe Garden on tap. There was a lot of people and not so clean.
5
Absolutely must do for Champagne Brunch on Sunday. It is not a buffet, but still generous portions of delicious Japanese food. Endless Champagne, coupled with yummy cocktails, fresh fish and a view is hard to beat!!
5
Terrific location with unrivalled views over Singapore. The food is exquisite and the atmosphere is vibrant
5
I wasn't sure how to justify going to the Ku De Ta, but the more I read the more I wanted to try and boy was I glad I did. It's a truly memorable experience, we had the menus in our hands promptly by our excellent waiter Ryan and he put us at ease with what to order. Even though we didn't eat the courses as they were suppose to be, he let things flow so our enjoyment wouldn't be diminished. My partner wasn't too keen on the Wasabi sorbet, so he treated her to a free helping of the wildberry, very thoughtful. This is dining with a twist, so don't expect hot veges and standard fair...Just sit back and let the evening evolve, you won't regret....and then there's the views!!
5
We had a short stopover for 7 hours in Singapore and decided to go to this wonderful place to have dinner without a reservation. The employees of KU DE TA where very frienly gave us a table outside as we whished and we were amazed how wonderful the view was. The food was marvellous and our waitress Dephenie helpful and very friendly. We enjoyed the time being there very much. A little recommendation we have concerning the espressi could be much better. Maybe an italien coffeemachine could help. :-)Silvia Rolf Flavio & Ursula from Zürich - Switzerland and Ital

This is my first review on tripadvisor and the experience at Ku De Ta, Singapore makes it definitely worth it.After visiting the skypark observation deck we decided to return for dinner the same evening. Not sure what to expect the Asian fusion offering was excellent. We asked for an outside table but decided to eat indoors as we did not want to be too near the bar area. The staff were exceptional and very accommodating. Even indoors you get an amazing view of Singapore at night, especially as the restaurant is opened up with the bi-fold doors. The experience and atmosphere is first rate. We arrived early to have a pre dinner drink at the bar and soak up the atmosphere.Now to the food...simply it was amazing! If daunted by the food, our waitress kindly explained each dish and what to expect. Sithra was our waitress for the evening and was first class. She knew the details of each dish and nothing was too much trouble to assist us in making a great choice....you really cannot go wrong with the food here. We were unsure of the Squid, but Sithra informed us it was fantastic and a signature dish, however we refrained and opted with the chicken and lamb which was stunning. To our surprise, Sithra presented us with a dish of the squid to try as complements from the chef..well, this was superb and we ate the lot...Sithra was true to her word.After dinner and very attentive service, we asked if we could sit in a private area for an after dinner drink as it was my partners birthday. This area is generally reserved for VIP guests but sure enough, Sithra managed to sort it. The experience and views were simply stunning.This has to be near if not at the top of our dining experiences, but a special mention has to go to our waitress. She really did her utmost to make the whole experience one to remember and cannot fault any element of service as she was fantastic!!! We look forward to returning again, and once again, thank you for a night to remember
5
A MUST for any newcomer to SINGAPORE ! There are very few top calibre restaurants in the world located in such a breathtaking location ! Adding most attentive enthusiastic staff and tasty nicely presented food from a modest menu harmoniously alow one to feel being on top of the world
4
If you are looking for a high class Singaporean experience this is a good place to go. The view is beautiful as you look over the lights of downtown Singapore and the bay at night. Just to go to the viewing deck costs 20 dollars so you might as well go up to the bar at Ku De Ta and get a drink for the same price. The service is very nice, to be expected at such a restaurant. But while the food is very good, there is a minimum of $80 per person for your meal and the plates are relatively small for their value. It is sort of a tapas style restaurant where everybody shares the various dishes. I do have to say though, the duck breast was wonderful and I would highly recommend it! So if you are looking to splurge, go for it, it is an experience you will not forget

We had dinner at 9pm on Friday night and arrived at 8.45pm. We wanted to wait for an outside table so had a Singapore sling at the club lounge bar. It was packed and there was nowhere to stand. The club lounge is renowned for good views but we couldn't see or even move amongst the mass of people. about 9.30pm a DJ started playing in the restaurant which i thought was an odd choice, especially when the song choices don't really set the tone for a sit down meal. We had our food and it was perfectly cooked. Would recommend the duck breast as it was lovely and tender.Our waiter was very good, his name was Ryan, but made us feel uncomfortable for not buying a bottle of wine, which we could not afford for £50/S$110 each minimum. You can't go around the skydeck, but at 11pm they close the skydeck so you are able to view the city from a small section, which is enough to take good photos across the marina with the skyline in the background.All in all a lovely meal, very pricey but you would expect that due to the location, but an uncomfortable atmosphere created by music and by waiter and by crowd control in the club lounge
5
Spend a wonderful evening with my Love at this fantastic restaurant with the best views of Singapore. Our dining experience was enhanced by the wonderful staff, especially Ryan our main waiter. We had soup, salad, mains,desert, coffee and 2 glasses of wine and it wasn't a huge shock when the bill came....if you are prepared. The menu is Japanese/Asian tapas style, which means it's sharing multi course eating. After dinner we went to the club lounge and took in the light show, definitely the highlight of our holiday
4
If you have had a hard day and would like to wind up a little, Ku De Ta is the place to be. The crowd is really great with good music and drinks.
5
Terrific view, great food and service. Japanese inspired menu with a twist. We enjoyed it all I especially loved the axing sorbets to finish. Berry and ginger...brilliant! Highly recommend a visit!
4
Splendid food ambience and crowd. Special credits to Jen who made good food recommendations and seamless reservation experience! :)
5
Had a dinner with a group of 7 people. The ambience was fantastic. We had a good table in the open facing very nice scenary. Thanks to Jen Santos for her reservation. Received good service from Ryan. Overall, we had an enjoyable dinner.
4
We arrived around 4pm not wanting to eat and were pleased to be told that we could just have a drink. We were only in tshirts and shorts and that, unlike some of the reviews we have read, was not a problem at all. We had had a beer each, took some fab photos of the spectacular views across Singapore and of course,the infinity pool, all for the same price it would have cost us for entry
5
We were having an event in MBS convention last week and we were thinking of a best place to take our overseas colleagues for dinner and drinks, a colleague of ours recommended Ku De Ta which is around the area, it turned out to be a great choice. Everything went well, the reservation was swift, we were given a very nice spot and we were all in awe. It was an awesome experience from the time we weâ€™re welcomed at the lobby til the time we left. Excellent service from Ryan, he was very attentive and helpful all throughout our stay, we felt very much taken care of. The ambience is exceptional, food is worth the money. I would definitely go back and recommend this place to my friends

My husband and I had booked a couple of weeks in advance for this restaurant. After reading mixed reviews on here we weren't sure what to expect, but we still wanted to go. The email confirmation we received gave us strict regulations on what we could and couldn't wear, they said smart casual long trousers no sports wear no sandals etc which is fair enough, and to arrive early because they would only hold our table for 15 minutes from our booked time. However, upon arrival we saw over at least half the other people there were in sandals with hawaiian shirts on and all sorts. We actually felt quite over dressed compared to a lot of other people, and they weren't being turned away or told that they were dressed inappropriately. We then got shown to our table, which we were told in our email that we couldn't specifically reserve because it's on a first come first served basis. Yet the best tables (the ones around the edge with the views of the city) all had reserved notices on them! The next thing we noticed was that a lot of the people who were in the bar area, which is outside on the terrace with a great view of the city, were not being shown to a table. We saw the same couples stood there for the whole time we were there. I know they say to arrive early for your slot, but they were there for over an hour and a half, and surely there's no way that they would let you up that early before your reservation time. So we came to some conclusions, the first being that they've booked just to go to the bar, which would have been great to know because we would have just done that rather than go to the restaurant. The second was that maybe people reserve tables at the restaurant and then just spend the whole evening at the bar looking at the view and not go into dinner. It's a free way to the top I guess because the other view point you have to pay to get into, and you don't have to pay to make a reservation at the restaurant. Either way it really annoyed us because we would have much preferred to just stand at the bar for an hour. If you do go to the restaurant though, the food is nice. Over priced for what it is, but your paying for the view, I've had better food in less pretentious places for less money. The staff are lovely though, friendly and always smiling. It would be nice if they had their menu on their website. It's a bit of a surprise when you sit down and your presented with the menu and they tell you that it's more of a tapas style restaurant where all the plates are small and for sharing, and then you look at the price of these small, sharing plates. It's very easy to get ahead of yourself if you don't keep track of how much everything is. So in summary, nice views if you get there early, nice food, but wouldn't go again.

Went to the SkyBar for some drinks a few nights ago for the 1st time. Firstly, the view. Wow amazing,really blew my mind. It's just amazing, I was speechless. Took a couple of shots before I settle at the bar and look through the menu. Lots of interesting cocktail names! A cocktail waiter, Faraq recommended me the Tony Starks Pepper,his service was excellent. He was very genuine and nice there are others but didn't get the name. Not formal, just the way I like it. He even told me a 'coin' joke. I'm coming back to Singapore in August and definitely gonna come back!In conclusion,service 10/5.
5
Great food and service. 5 star all the way, we made a reservation and my husband had to go and purchase jeans as he was in shorts!!! So worth it, the food was out of this world as was the service, there was one dish which we didn't really like and we told them and they took it off the bill, which was not our attention but just to let them know!!
4
We visited the bar during the F1 weekend. Not sure about the other nights, but the place was packed. Too crowded for this type of venue, ie. high-end and pardon the pun. As a result the service suffered.The views and the place was great.Worth another visit for us
4
Definitely one of the most spectacular views in all of Singapore. The food was very good but the portions were small and very expensive.
4
Great food and service! A wonderful experience with the views if Singapore from the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sans. Recommend that if you're visiting Singapore, you try this.
4
Awesome venue for a sunday session, bring your credit card (just like most places in Singapore) but worth at least one while you soak up the views and tunes.
5
I was afraid it might be a nice setting with just average food. Food was really nice, well prepared.Of course you pay for food and setting so dont expect cheap meal. Im glad they keep up good standards and our sashimi salad, duck, seared tuna, asparagus and drinks were just as good as they can get. Few drinks and pictures by the glass edge later was a nice finish to the evening. Really worth to try. I spent more in cantonese restaurant in Pan Pacific hotel without setting and without great food so KU DE TA is really worth every $.pop in, enjoy and dont forget to take pics of your food for fellow trip advisor readers:
4
The restaurant serves delicious food and the staff are knowledgeable and attentive. But the security in the area next to the restaurant really spoil the experience when they refuse to allow you to take photographs other than behind the restaurant umbrellas. 200 dollars on a meal for one surely deserves a 2minute photo opportunit
5
It was the choice and only choice for us when we wanted to bring our UK friends for their first night in Singapore. With a panoramic view of the amazing singapore skyline combined with delicious asian inspired cusisine, Ku De Ta is the restaurant to be. The manager had a good knowledge of the menu and explained the menu well to us. The food was creative,modern using asian ingredients. We were amazed and admired the chef creativity in using such familiar asian ingredients in such original way. We enjoyed our selection of seafood starters recommended by the manager. The beef and fish we had for the mains were cooked perfectly. It was a perfect evening of good food, good service and a million dollar view. Great place to bring friends from oversea
4
We tried the tasting menu. I think we had about 7 courses. Oh my we were so so full it was ridiculous! The food was beautiful but not all of it to my liking. Expect to pay through the roof for champagne and alcohol, like most nice restaurants in Singapore. It was my birthday and my partner organised a surprise cake and the staff sung happy birthday!! Unfortunately I did suffer severe food poisoning after eating here. I had to see an emergency Dr. The only thing I ate that my partner didn't was the prawns. Our concierge contacted Ku De Ta and notified them. Don't let it put you off though, really I think we were unlucky as this place gets so many great reviews.
4
If I were to go again, I would go for drinks, not food. With an exception for the California Rolls, our dinner wasn't as good as we would expect for the prices (a minimum spend of 80$ pp is required) we paid. Salmon sashimi was okay, but the main courses of duck and teriyaki chicken were questionable.Indoors and outdoors, this place is indeed nice. The service was very attentive for the booking and during the dinner. They called us ahead to inform us about delays and after dinner we were able to move outdoors as well. Although it didn't seem absolutely necessary to dress up, the atmosphere gives you that fancy feeling, so ladies go for high heels!Maybe combine it with the Club Lounge on a Sunday night so that you check out both sides of the view from up there
3
The view from here is almost worth the price...the food is pretty ordinary.The appetisers we had were the fried squid which was ok, and the sashimi which was great.Our main courses were the excellent black cod, and the shrimp sautÃ© which was not good, the shrimp were overcooked and lacking flavour.Service was marginal, as our appetisers were brought at different times, the first only minutes after we ordered, and the second 5 minutes later.With a bottle of wine the price was $468.0
5
Ku De Ta is a must do in Singapore if you can afford it. Expensive even by Singapore standards it is nevertheless a fantastic experience and the views of the city are unparalleled and breathtaking. Service is fantastic. The food and wine excellent but be prepared to pay
5
Excellent visit to this restaurant with the best view in Singapore! Great staff, especially the lady who organised a table for us and also our waiter Arlan who was very attentive and professional.
4
It's expensive and a little over the top but if you looking for a fabulous experience and prepared to forget about the budget for the night then this is a must Singapore experience. The food is excellent but wine list average and overpriced but the atmosphere is great.
4
Since this place had the great view of the Singapore skyline going for it being situated on top of Marina Bay Sands, one would forgive the commonplace furnishing and the nothing out of the ordinary food offering. We ordered, Japanese maki, grilled fish, chinese peking duck and I remembered nothing to rave about. The music seemed too loud for my preference. It's not a place to go to if you're after a subdued atmosphere for intimate conversation. Still, the view more than makes up for its shortcomings
5
This restaurant is located on top of Sands Casino. Usually, such eateries - in a similar crowded and touristy place - offer below standard food, as they do not cater to regular repeating guests and expect that their patrons probably will never visit their place again in the future. However, I was really pleasantly surprised of the friendly service, the nice presentation of the food and of the great taste. On the other hand, local Singaporeans might visit this place as well - maybe repeatedly with guests - and to be able to have the opportunity to get pampered with fine food and service just a few steps from the viewing platform, they will - without any doubt - take advantage of this opportunity.H.

Food is over-priced (S$700 for 4 adults & 2 children), and the whole restaurant is very over-rated. Extremely noisy; very average food; off-handed staff; poor quality fit-out, no table-cloths etc). Seem to want to cater only to the Yuppie, Must-Be-Seen type of crowd who have to make out they are o-so-trendy
4
The food and service were excellent. Good choices on the menu with an interesting concept of food sharing at the table. Original creations but the chef. The view of Singapore is out of this world. On the down side, it is extremely expensive and you pay for the view
2
The only thing going for this place is that it is at the top of the iconic Marina Bay Sands and the best views of Singapore. Nothing else. Overcrowded with loud mouthed tourists, rude staff and terrible food
3
Just like the pioneer branch in Bali, the view is spectacular and they know it. But other than the luxury of dining/drinking in a cosy environment on the top of an iconic hotel, KDT doesn't have much else to offer. Food-wise, it is not outstanding even if quality is not subpar and portions are small. The food served pales in comparison to what they have in Bali.Basically, it is overpriced. But I guess you are paying for the view, which could cost up to SGD$20/adult just to take a lift to the roof (better put that money into a meal, right? Since KDT customers need not pay to go up)
5
Food is good. Ambiance is ok buta bit too crowded.. ... but service was excellent ! The one in charge of us was very accomodating .He explained happily what the best sellers are....the favorites and what to expect from our dishes. He even knows what the strange ingredients are in those dishes...in the end our guest from Russia was very satisfied with the dining experience. The food ordered came at the right time with the right portions. The chocolate cake... the ginger sorbet was yummylicous ! We will surely come back for more !Main coarse is ok..but for the service from Leo, we will never go wrong in coming back again and again with our client.
3
The mixed Asian menue is trying hard to be creative and "fusion" but only manages half way. This is a place for visitors out of town and a corporate credit card. As such it can be great and you can pre-book an outdoor table with views over Singapore strait for a memorable evening. Not likely you will come back being local though as food and service is better elsewhere
3
The view is excellent (when the haze is not in town). But the food is not great. Drinks are crazy prices, even for a town with sky-high alcohol prices. Seating can also be a problem.
4
Great sharing platters. The tuna was excellent. Once you get past the view and the wind, restaurant is nice
5
Nice view overlooking the Marina Bay and wonderful food. Chose outdoor seating to enjoy the evening breeze.
3
I like bringing overseas guests to Ku De Ta for the unique experience of being at the top of Marina Bay Sands and for the excellent view of the city skyline and Marina Bay.But other than that, I would not go to Ku De Ta. The food is only so-so (I've been there at least 8 times for lunch, dinner and just drinks. The service is depends on who your server is. The general feeling that I get that it's pretentious (starting from the Reception Counter on the ground floor, to the hosts at the top floor, to the service staff) is, but I have had great servers who were very friendly and attentive. I will continue to bring overseas guests there, but that would be the only reason for me to go
4
A very special place on the top roof of Singapore. Great overview of the overall city and beyond. A good crowd and nice atmosphere. Service is very efficient. DJ music can be loud depending on where you are seated. We were there for drinks and deserts. We enjoyed it until the bill hits us. Never mind still a place you would like to visit at least once or more if you can afford it
3
Went to the Ku De Ta.Service was slow and not very forthcoming. Drinks were priced according to the venue and we could live with that. Only had one barman serving 40 people. Very surly staff. definitely not happy campers. Music was loud and pulsating. certainly was not suited to the demographic of the customers. Would not return
4
The view really is worth a trip to the top , even if its just for a drink. There are many more fabulous places to eat in Singapore, but this does take some beating for a special occasion. Staff are very attentive and knowledgable . Food is good, Asian fusion, but menu doesn't seem to change. It is expensive
1
The view was amazing but the food was terrible. After spending $180 AUD on two entrees, two mains and a glass of wine we felt ripped off and had to go elsewhere to eat more as we were still hungry. The vegetable tempura was horrible with the potato and carrot still raw. Biting into raw hard potato was not what I expected when dining there. The staff were quite rude when we wanted to have a look outside at the view and actually walked us over to the edge where they wanted us to stand. Do yourself a favour and go to the observation deck which is only one floor lower. You will be able to walk right around to look at the view without being harassed and then you can have a great meal elsewhere where the food is edible. I don't know why anyone other than unsuspecting tourists would choose to eat here
3
No big deal despite the hype. However, the view of the skyline is nice but the congestion from the crowd tends to spoil the on top of the world experience especially when it's standing room only. It is not value for money but one of those things you may like to experience once so you have bragging rights. Nothing extraordinarily special about the menu
2
Great views but service poor and furniture tatty. Food expensive and lunch buffet compulsory from our table. Poor value
4
Visited Ku DE Ta with 4 friends for drinks and cigars. The views are awesome as is the music and ambience. The staff are super great at ensuring service standards.
A must visit place......but be prepared to pay for the ambience and location !!!
5
Fantastic food, amazing wine and even better atmosphere and view.
The service was excellent and they certainly treated us like kings.
I also recommend getting there earlier and going out of the balcony for a cocktail beforehand

Have been there twice, both times with out of town business guests. Other than the great view from the MBS rooftop, there's little reason to dine at Ku De Ta, much less pay the exorbitant prices there. Much better to just have a drink at the bar after dinner somewhere else
4
I have been here several times and will no doubt return but that is mainly for the view. One of the only ways to get a view of the city from the top of the Marina Bay Sands (without staying at the hotel) is to eat at Ku De Ta. The food is good but a pricey. Best to go at lunch
4
Although this restaurant is very pricey, the food is very good and there is a nice selection of winesI found the service to be very good but by far the view is one like no other place in the world!! Perfect place for an anniversary celebration and the location is also perfect. There is plenty to do right in the area after you eat your fantastic meal and take in the beautiful Singapore skyline at sunset! A must at sunset!! Be sure to make a reservation for 6:30 so you can take your time and also take in the view! Highly recommend this place!

Terrible place, only for tourists. Food is not good, service worse than in any cheaper, less "in" place. Overrated, this is a casino business, and not a proper restaurant
4
Its all about the view, music and ambiance. Great place to hang out for drinks with friends. Great place for people watching. The view is spectacular. The starters are nice as well and they have a great selection of wines. Must go destination if you are visiting Singapore
4
First thing First. Must visit the restaurant while in Singapore. View of city skyline is great. I prefer Bar area for view, this area can get crowded with photographers. Food is just fine, nothing home to write about. But service was excellent and with smile. Order were taken promptly and delivered in time and to the satisfaction. Tuna Tartare and salmon sashimi for appetizers and crispy salmon salad, were good. For dinner, Duck breast. ribeye, and halibut were prepared well.For desert Apple and honey was excellent. In nutshell, place is pricey, food is good and view is excellent, and is definitely worth visiting once. and may be twice, if you had to impress someone regarding your taste in food and place. One regret though, did not try Ohmi Steak, then again, may be next time !!

Fantastic place and views with amazing food and service. We had the large sofas table overlooking the gardens, golf course and beyond. The brunch menu was new with a fair selection and choices. All the food was excellent and presented exactly at the right time given the generous servings for a high quality brunch. The champagne and cocktails option was declined given the hour but other tables took them to the full. I did order a Bloody Mary a la carte as other tables looked great as then did mine with lots of spice and ice. Staff attention was perfect at the table and the reception was warm and informative. Will go again at night on my next visit to Singapore
5
I went to this restaurant as part of a group of four. the attention to detail was incredible. the views were spectacular. we had a drink outside at the bar before dinner a bit pricey but we watched the sun go down over Singapore amazing. For dinner we sat inside on one of the middle tables the waiter we had a very professional and attentive. we all order an entree, main and dessert. For the entree I had spicy sashimi salad and the others had crispy-sticky baby squid, main was roast pork belly, roast duck breast and US prime ‘brandt beef’ ribeye with a side order of spicy fried mushrooms and wok fried broccolini. the food was melt in your mouth amazing. the potion sizes looked small but was just enough. Dessert warm bitter chocolate cake, ice creams & sorbets with coffee. everything about this place and the food screams understated classy. the price is a minimum $80 SGD per person spend but well worth. the only thing was that we were not aware till after dinner that we could have transferred the cost of the drinks at the bar to the table for dinner
5
We liked everything about this restaurant. The food was wonderful, the wine first rate, and the views were astounding.
5
Thanks to the Chef: the tasting menu including the wine pairing was delicious!
Special thanks to Leo for being our host! Asian hospitality at its finest.
Thanks to the reception desk for a - finally - good table for a special event.

Recommended to us by our hotel concierge we hadn't realised exactly what we had let ourselves in for! As everyone says amazing views - but i swear I have not been grilled so much and so often by restaurant staff everytime i left the table and tried to look at it! All very polite but so wearing and unpleasant - combined with the gale like breezes blowing through even the inside tables - the food would have had to have beem ambrosial to compensate and it wasn't - perfectly adequate but it was not an evening i would care to repeat. If you can stand the bad manners - have just an overpriced drink for $40 - and save yourself the $400 dollars we spent on being made to feel like tresspassers 
2
Really not worth it. Tables are dirty, service very poor, food is not good at all. Tempura ow lobster chewy, Tempura of prawns was awful and oily, shitakes salad not good, overall extremely expensive for a lousy restaurant…even the Edamame were not cooked enough.
5
The courses were just what we expected, attractive arrangement, good food, well prepared, not too much - and so was the service. Good selection of wines, and the view from Marina Bay Sands Hotel is undoubtedly great. We´d visit this restaurant again next time in Singapore
5
We made a online Reservation at Ku De Ta and asked for a outdoor table. Even if we were the first time at the Restaurant we got this table. The staff was absolutely friendly fromt he reception to the Service Team at the table. We enjoyed being treated as someone Special. The Food was creative delicious and from perfect Quality. We enjoyed every bit and had a evening to remember.
1
A beautiful view and good service and you can have these without eating !!! We went for dinner as a couple and ordered a number of dishes to share - each dish had a major fault - the salmon was tasteless; the salmon skin salad was all greens and no skin; the seared tuna was not seared but grey on the outside because the pan was not hot enough to sear it; the Iberian pork cheeks needed another hour of cooking; and the broccolini, well we received the stems, somebody else has our heads. We skipped desert, finished our good wine (at 4 x retail) and left.Just go late afternoon and have a cocktail on the terrace and take in the views; then go somewhere good that understands food for your dinner and enjoy yourself. There are many good options in Singapore, but this is not one of them
3
You can't beat the view from Ku De Ta. On one of the tallest patios in Singapore, some 50ish stories above the ground, it's pretty awesome. It's too bad the service and drinks aren't as great. Overpriced and "could careless" service. A word of note, unless you're staying at the hotel, you won't get the best views possible from the top. Your limited to just the bar/restaurant area, not the expansive decks below where you can get even better views
4
Twice we stopped in for G&T and to enjoy the spectacular view. The bar food is expensive and so-so, but that was just a sideshow to the view. The drinks also come to less than a pair of tickets to the Skydeck so worth considering ;
4
We booked for lunchtime for daylight views and were fortunate enough to have a window table. The sun shone, people were drinking at the outside bar and we decided to try some of the buffet before taking photographs of the wonderful views. Mistake....by the time we had had drinks, made our choices and eaten a delicious starter, the weather had closed in, it was pouring with rain and the views had disappeared into the mist! Nevertheless, we had a very enjoyable experience with a wide choice of good food, excellent service and , for a time, wonderful views
5
The tasting menu is just right for those who desire variety but have a small appetite.
Marniza who assisted us throughout the night have been great.
3
Expensive beer at SGD 16 but the feeling of being on top of the world is worth it. They also have a brunch which too is fairly expensive for average tourists at around SGD 98.
5
Had an excellent 4 course dinner with friends. The views are to die for, this place is definitely the best location in Singapore to watch the sunset. We found the wine selection extensive, if not a little expensive. We particularly appreciated some of the more unusual items on the list and really enjoyed our very dry NZ Riesling. The food was exquisite and is better than some 1 and 2* Michelin starred restaurants we've frequented. The staff were attentive, but not oppresive. In short we're the sort of customers that are hard to please but we were impressed with Ku de Ta at the MBS
5
My wife and I made a reservation for dinner at Ku De Ta restaurant and when we arrived there was a minor mix up with the spelling of our name, couldn't find us on the reservation list.When I brought this to the attention of the restaurant staff they went out of their way to make our night special and they succeeded brilliantly. We truly cannot thank them enough for their efforts. Coming from Perth Australia the city of over priced food and indifferent service this was an eye opener on how to wow customers. We could not fault the food or the service. The ambiance was great the views were wonderful and I thank all the staff for a most memorable evening.We cannot wait to go back and try some of the other delectable dishes on the menu. Congratulations to you all
5
Dining on the 57th floor with majestic views of the Singapore skyline was definitely one of the best experiences ever. Would like to compliment service crew, Ivo, for making our time spent at the restaurant a great one. His cheerfulness and attentiveness really made a difference to our dining experience there
5
My colleagues and I came to enjoy the view and girded ourselves for a potentially overpriced dinner. We were overwhelmed by both the view and the meal. There are not many al fresco dining 57 stories above the water. Additionally, the architects took the precaution of installing large sliding doors that were used to close off the dining room when the wind became a bit strong. The food was excellent as was the service. The dinner was served family style for sharing, which allowed a greater opportunity to sample the menu. Unlike many fusion restaurants, the dishes did not try so hard to be special that the preparation masked the underlying food. The wine list offered a reasonable array of options. While the prices were not inexpensive, they were no stiffer than found on Boat Quay or the hotel. After dinner, we stayed to enjoy the view from the deck. While like the wine list, the selection at the bar was not extensive, it had a reasonable range of options
4
Almost certainly, this restaurant provides the most spectacular view in and of Singapore, perched on top of the 50+ story Marina Bay hotel and shopping center. Really fine food presented with excellent service, although not inexpensively. Plan on $100 for an appetizer, beverage, tip, and tax; well worth it for the future. The humiliation is that you will not be allowed to walk onto the observation deck adjacent to the restaurant without going downstairs and getting separate $20 per person tickets for that experience. Even the wonderful dining experience does not justify this treatment of guests
5
what an experience! The reservation was confirmed quickly for lunch the next day while having drinks the night before at the bar 2amOur waiter Ryan was outstanding and gave us great tips on food selection. The food is very delicious, fine dining Japanese/Asian with breath taking views of the skyline of Singapore. Completely satisfied will visit again the Sommelier was asked to surprise us with a port to complement dessert it was perfect2008 Tokaji Furmint Late Harvest Oremus from Hungary everything & more you would expect for fine dinning. Thank you Ryan
5
If you are in Singapore or planning to go to Singapore this restaurant you must try..not for F&B but, the view around. Fantastic view of famous Infinity Swimming Pool and Singapore's own Skyline . We had plan to go to flyer to see Singapore by Sunset, but my local friend suggested this place to sit and enjoy drink, food & sunset. Try to go around 4-5 pm so you can sit for bit longer do not forgot to order some food or drink. Bit expensive but you will take entire bird eye with you..
5
We live in Jakarta and I took my wife there, very last minute, to celebrate here birthday. The staff was incredible, the management very accommodating and the cuisine excellent. I'll visited the lounge on several occasions; however, the restaurant definitively is my favorite of the two. The server, Sitra, was absolutely "spot on" with both her service and interpersonal skills. My wife had a marvelous birthday dinner and then the Manager on duty, Irene, arranged a guided tour of the lounge area, since my wife had not visited there before. There was even a complimentary birthday plate, that was delivered very elegantly and discreetly. Great food, incredible service, outstanding customer service... Exceeded my expectation
4
This restaurant is located in one of the worlds most iconic settings and fully delivers on it's (pricey) promise!
5
We use the bar as a pre meal watering hole and the mix of concrete . colonial and maritime views are breath-taking (as long as the weather is on par). if it is raining the don't bother, however we have had a spectacular night where the clouds were low enough to see a storm over the city at the same height..Not the cheapest place in town however, for a beer but then the views mitigate that and ensure only the best cliental.Budget available - defiantly worth a visit, you need to arrive before sunset - 1800 ish and then depart 1930 and get a taxi to the area of the Fullerton water front and watch the light show against the building ( with albeit of course - albeit again expensive) but memorable. no matter however times we have seen it, it still stirs things - well done Singapore
5
Great location in Singapore. Need to book well in advance and re-confirm a month notice but worth an experiance. Great service and choice of food, but wonder why wine is rare commodity by the pricing point of view?. Coming from Europe, wine is not the first choice I would opt for. Otherwise food is reasonably priced and value for the experiance. Walk around the bar area between the main course and dessert to enjoy the best view Singapore offers. Also get a free admission to the bar and dance area next to the roof top pool. Overall, delightful dinning experiance not to be missed while in Singapore
4
we spent the night here for our 4th anniversary and i cant say i have any regrets, food was delicious, wine selection perfect and to be honest it wasnt that expensive ,500 $ for a 2 course meal with wine and drinks , amazing ambients ,stunning views and a real happy buzzing place ,well don
3
Dined at Ku de ta a week ago. The food was pretty good as was the location. Biggest gripe for me was the wine list. From what I could see, the minimum price for a bottle of white wine was a bit over $100. There should be options below that level. The wine was nice enough but price should have been half that, even taking into account the premium you pay for wines at restaurants. The restaurant is obviously aimed at the tourist market. I wouldn't go back
5
It was the greatest experience for me in terms of food and atmosphere in my trip in Asia (4 countries in 3 weeks). It is a magical place, you can see from there the whole Singapore and definitely worth eating here. Make a reservation in advance
4
If you're not great with heights this might not be the ideal dinner venue for you...this place is high!! Amazing views of Singapore guaranteed. We ate a late dinner at an outdoor table, only complaint was it was extremely windy but can't control nature I suppose!! Service was flawless, food was amazing, drinks superb (expensive even by Singapore standards but I suppose at that location they can be warranted). All in all great night to celebrate my partners birthday!!
5
My husband & I visited Ku De Ta on our last night in Singapore. We were so looking forward to the experience as we had been told great things about it. We were not disappointed in the slightest. From the incredible views, the chic bar to the restaurant itself, it is a must see if you visit Singapore. We were also very happy to check out the wine list and find our beloved Greco Di Tufo wine, rarely found outside of Italy and were surprised when the waiter asked us about it. He said that his Italian Manager loved the wine. Next thing we knew, Fabio, the Italian Manager came over to say hello and speak of the wine. This guy is very knowledgeable about his products and his attitude to his Guests was outstanding. We will remember Singapore for many reasons, but Fabio and the Greco Di Tufo experience will stay with us for a long time to come. We will definitely return and recommend this fabulous place!
5
The staff was excellent, we had a table next to us who accidentally spilt red wine on a bag, the waiters and waitress were so kind and help with ensuring that tables meal was the best they could have had. Our waitress Mitch, who was a captain waitress filled my friend and I full of knowledge, she was very professional and sophisticated. I was also lucky enough to meet the assistant manager, Irene as well she made out night the best night we had in Singapore. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, it can be a little expensive however it worth every cent! I don't like pork but decided to have the pork belly it was the best piece of meat I have ever tasted! Thank you to chef and every other staff member who made our night
1
We had booked a table thinking it would be a beautiful experience. Eating dinner with a view over singapore.Yet we could not have been more wrong. Over crowed and over expensive.Despite booking in advance we were seating indoors in the middle with no view whatsoever. The food was in ridiculous portions; I ordered the prawns..... There were 6 prawns and that was my main meal. There was a requirement to spend $80++ per person as well and the wine was very expensive and yet very cheap tasting. The views once you elbow your way through are lovely but you might as well just go to the skypark and then buy a drink elsewhere to have a good time !!
5
Once again, we visited Ku De Ta and had a wonderful experience, fantastic food and great service (Thanks, Sitra!). Highly recommended as a very special treat.
4
A bit on the pricey side, but lunch bento box is good value for around 50sgd and comes with a stunning view over singapore marina area, without habing to pay extra for the sky deck.
5
The welcoming smile and friendly greeting, the relaxed and pleasant table staff and sommelier, the selection and combination of food and outstanding wine was all topped off with the most amazing selection of music from the house DJ. A night to remember!
3
We had very high expectations for this restaurant, the view is indeed amazing, especially if you get an outside table. Other than that the food is really nothing special neither the service. The place is very very busy and it's difficult to manage to have a normal conversation with someone in the same table. Menu is WAY overpriced for the quality of the food. They have a nice wine menu with wines from most of the countries but again very expensive but I guess normal prices for Singapore point of view. To conclude, good place to go for a cocktail and admire the view but definitely not for food
4
We ate at the restaurant as we wanted somewhere special for last night of our holiday, we originally booked 1 altitude but they emailed us a few weeks before saying they were closed for lunar new yearWe went for a drink first in the terrace bar with great views of the singapore skyline, although a little pricey, but then so are most places in singaporeWe had great food, squid, pork lollypops, beef and seared tuna. I actually thought the food was reasonably priced for Singapore and Marina bay sands and tasted great. Also had a new year champagne offer on too so had a couple of glasses.A little disappointed that we had a poor table in the middle of the restaurant so didn't really get to enjoy our food with amazing food. Still had a lovely night, service was goo
5
excellent service-taken care of like a VIP...chanced upon the restaurant-bar when we visited the marina skypark. I had the lovely japanese bento with grilled sirloin and my partner had the lunch set with roasted pork, the chef even made us a special none spicy mushroom side dish as we couldn't eat spicy food. after lunch we were toured around the kudeta club and managed to see the pool. Kudos to Sharie and Arnie. we will be back
4
Alison our server was fantastic, the food was as good as Nobu park lane and the view was to die for. I ordered a g and t at the bar and got served a vodka tonic them once I corrected the bar man he got a huge attitude. Also remember to ask for your change at the bar!!!! Or else!!!
5
This is my awesome dinner experience on the last night of my weekend stay at Singapore recently.Our group of 4 were celebrating a special occasion & KDT(my short form for Ku De Ta) couldn't have a been a better place to create a memorable evening. From start to finish, we were wowed not only by the food, which exceeded our expectations and then some, but also by the quality of service presented; making us feel like we were their guests at home!When we arrived for dinner, we were warmly received by Aneta who was all smiles and proceeded to show us to the bar for pre-dinner drinks. The view was simply out of this world and took our breath away!!! Then we were attended to by the charming Ben & Frederick, insanely friendly bartenders who entertained us with their banter. We had the Expresso Martini which was Frederick's excellent recommendation, before being sat at our table by a lovely young lady Rohana. We were very indecisive to be seated indoor or outdoors as it was very windy and even changed our minds thrice before settling indoors and yet Rohana remained accommodating while we decided. Finally seated, we were served 4 glasses of the best champagne to begin our celebration by the insanely charming and handsome sommelier Michael, who also recommended a perfect bottle of red for a group of varying wine preferences! Our waiter Arlan was a pleasure to speak to, provided excellent recommendations, always ensuring we had everything we needed without being imposing or pushy. Finally for desserts, we moved outdoors to take in the breathtaking view and indulge in post dinner of ciggies and coffee. We are definitely going back again soon!!
5
We went to Ku De Ta for my birthday dinner. The food was excellent and the serving staff, Kini Wei, was very helpful. We told her that we cannot take pork & shellfish, she went to check and ensure that the food we ordered does not contain any of it. We were impressed with her attentiveness and totally enjoyed our dinner! However, we were unhappy that the1st table given to us was in a tight corner. We requested for table change and it was arranged after checking with the front counter
4
Second visit - this time as host not guest. Booking was seamless online and the call to confirm a different time was apreciated. The view is spectacular BUT you are 50-odd storeys up so if you have Asian guests who feel the cold maybe warn them (the restaurant does provide wraps though!). We have the CNY set meal - very good indeed. Becuase of the popularity you get a 2 hour slot but that is ample time - and if the wind is blowing and you are outside......its long enough. Price - $2000 for 7 of us with wine (not much though) - so be careful!
4
My friend's children n mine were relatively young so we were very appreciative of her kind help in getting the utensils we need. She even recommended the type of food we should get for the children which was a memorable experience for us.
4
This was our second visit to Ku De Ta. Being located on the 57th floor at Marina Bay Sands obviously gives great views of the city and the bay. On the expensive side but the food and service levels are very good.
4
Excellent service from Arlan and great food. Reservation is highly recommended, dinner are always fully booked.
5
wonderful cny brunch with the help of the friendly staff.. go here for the ambience and look for marycel
5
Took my daughter to the Marina Bay Sands with an expectation to access the Terrace Bar for a drink but eventually found ourselves at the Ku De Ta. I made an inquiry about dinner and found ourselves at a table within minutes but on a time limit - had to be finished by 8.30 pm to accommodate for a prior reservation (we arrived at about 6.50 pm) - understood and accepted. Two courses and a carafe of Sangria - very good value in comparison to individual cocktails. The SGD80 min spend per person was easy and the food was magnificent. Cooked to perfection, the flavours were outstanding. Table service was excellent and we were well served by Arlan; he was responsive immediately to any inquiries. Views across and around Singapore were brilliant.I will absolutely go back
5
A few notes first.Get a taxi or the MRT. The traffic around here can be awful, and parking is expensive.If you have dinner here there is a minimum spend of S$80 (about GBP40) per person. This is easily racked up though! Bear in mind just to go to the viewing deck it is GBP15 each.You are allowed 2 hours for your meal and you can be asked to move on - if you have finished. We stayed on and were not asked to vacate.There are some outside tables and the view from there is great. Inside there are a few tables around the edge where there is limited view. The rest of the restaurant only has a restricted view of rooftops of the city. You are at 50 odd floors up after all.Before or after your meal you can wander around the outside quite freely to look at the view.The the food we had was brilliant- we had 2 courses each and shared a 'pud'. All beautifully cookedI I loved the biggest helping of Foie Gras that I have ever had and it was heavenly. Sevice was first class. There when neededThe bill for the 2 of us was GBP140 and that included 2 glasses of their cheapest wine
5
We celebrated our mom's birthday at Kudeta Restaurant, Marina Bay Sands. We had the best fine dining experience plus the breathtaking view. The staff were so accommodating especially Ivo and Fabio who were there who made our dinner memorable and extra special. Food was great and served based on our specific requests. Planning to visit again Singapore and drop by for another fascinating meals
3
We called early in the morning to book a table for 9pm , as my wife is a celiac we checked and asked over the phone if the restaurant could cater for this dietary requirement , which we were told would not be a problem. Once we arrived we were taken to our table and presented with menus. I explained to the waitress of our requirements and we were quickly informed that all we could eat was raw fish with no seasoning or other ingredients, everything else contained gluten and could not be modified! Now if this was explained to us we would have made alternative arrangements and would not be stranded at 9pm looking for a venue to have dinner.i cannot comment on the quality of food as we didn't even get the chance to smell any dishes from the kitchen as we were in the restaurant quicker than the man who delivers the mail.I can comment on our overall experience which was unsatisfactory and could have been avoided while our booking was made earlier on in the day.Another issue i found was that the atmosphere is extremely noisy and it is very difficult to have a conversation
3
A casual business dinner near CNY .Not a memorable meal as my sirlion steak was served cold. The dozen oyster was great but the salmonWas only so so. My host ordered a glass of wine n i had chinese tea. We shared a fruit platter which cost$22.Service was not great as we had to remind the waitress to take away used spoon and replace with fresh ones the next serve. In total the bill for both of us came out to $340(inclusive of a glass of wine). If i were to sort of monies myself i would go elsewhere.
4
We went to Ku De Ta for a quick lunch before we headed to the airport to go home and it was the perfect finish to our holiday. The restaurant is located on top of the Marina Bay Sands and offers great views. In fact, we had gone to Altitude for the views a few days prior however I enjoyed the view better from Ku De Ta. The food was lovely (great for sharing as well), it was well priced for fine dining and there were plenty of vegetarian options for me. The service was great and we managed to eat three courses in under an hour
5
I have had lunch and loved it. The food was perfect and the staff very nice, helpfull and proffesional. I met Fabio after a question, he made my visit extra special. Thank you Fabio
5
The food was amazing, the pork belly is a must try.
You are definitely paying for the view.
Though it is expensive, the service food and view are all well worth it.
4
Fantastic food, fairly well priced, very good service, great views. It is great you can dine here without being a guest of the Marina Bay Sands
5
my husband made a reservation for the two of us to have a special dinner for my birthday. Food was alright but what we really appreciate was the excellent service provided by Kudeta's staff named Arlan. Thanks Arlan, keep up the good job, All the best
5
This is definitely worth the money - outstanding view, meals and service! A special mention to Leo for looking after my friend and I to make this evening such a wonderful experience - One we will not forget!We continued on at the Club next door!Keep up the excellent work, and I will be back
5
I spent another business evening at Kudeta. Service was immaculate and the food outstanding, very good wine list and the right champagne choice. Each time my guests are amazed by the location and the kitchen. Followed by some drinks at the club you get Singapore at its best!
5
I was anticipating my visit to this place and I'm glad that the view, food and even service didn't fall below my expectations. The price is a little on the pricey side but that's only because you're also paying for the excellent Singapore landscape. It was really windy and chilly that night I had my dinner there but the experience was definitely great. Make sure to keep some stomach space for their desserts. They were awesome. We popped over to the club lounge after dinner just to take a glimpse at the night scenery. Dinner starts at 6pm. Unless you're intending to stay there (and of course spend some good money) for a couple hours, you're recommended to reserve a dinner after 7pm. If you're fine with the wind, I'd recommend you to sit outside. Inside, it's enclosed, so it tends to be a little loud as the night goes on. Staff there were nice and Leo was really helpful and nice. He made my dinner better with good service, lots of smiles and some small chats. I'll be looking forward for my next visit
5
Me and my lady had dinner on 27th October, had a wonderful time laughing and having Marycel hospitality to serve us. Marycel you've done a flawless awesome job. Not to forget Simon,thank you so much for arranging the dinner for us. We will be back soon.
5
Travelled from Perth for our daughter's 30th and chose KU DE TA as our restaurant of choice as we had eaten here previously and loved every minute of the experience. This time not disappointed and our hostess ARA treated us like royalty and made sure whatever our request, she exceeded our expectations. The food and atmosphere was sensational, the best we have had. A memorable night. Thanks Ku De Ta
2
Was in Ku De Ta on Friday night with my wife and mother in law. I will say that the waiter we had, Leo, was absolutely brilliant especially with advising my mother in law who is ceoliac, he was exceptionally good. Unfortunately that's where the good review ends, the food was cold, yes it's high up and open to elements but I would doubt if it was hot coming out. It's ludicrously overpriced, perhaps to be expected in such a place but what you get in terms of food was a rip off, so we felt we couldn't tip after that even though our waiter was fantastic. Fine, you may say we were paying for the view, but we were put at back of outside restaurant and couldn't see the CBD, and when we tried to go take some pictures the staff were forceful and moved us very quickly, which was utterly rude considering what we'd paid for a very average meal.My advice, go to skydeck below for the views and eat somewhere else. Never agai
5
Hi....well what can I say? service was fast and excellent! Food was amazing! Its worth to dine in here with a beautiful view of Singapore City...
3
If you want the view, this restaurant will suffice to give you the best view of Singapore. If you're hungry and want great food, go for another place. Nevertheless, the sushi was not bad, it was good. Certain things on the menu were average. We had much better food in Singapore. Like, Tatsuya, that was really good too. Enjoy
5
My friend and I had been wanting to go up there for their food, drinks and of course view.. So after like 1 year, we went up. Amazing view, incredible service, the food is great!! Not to mention the drinks.. We went on a Wednesday so we actually got a free pass for their club lounge which has 1 free drinks for ladies so we went after such a fulfilling dinner at the restaurant. Thumbs up specially for our waiter for that night by the name of LEO
5
Located on the rooftop of the Marina Bay Sands hotel ,which of course is one of the most familiar buildings in Singapore, or even in whole Asia. Go to tower 3 and there is lift which takes you up in the sky. Views are absolutely amazing and our waiter(from Philippines) was great, real friendly and informative. Food was fine dining level and real good, made of quality ingredients. Of course this isn't the cheapest place, because Singapore itself isn't that cheap and you have to remember that great restaurants aren't cheap on street level either :) To us dinner was worth of every penny because the view alone
4
You get to have a drink in a really crowded bar where you can't sit down as the tables are reserved for dining - though very few were eating, all were drinking squashed into the space around the circular bar.However, you are 60 some floors up, with a great view, a cool breeze and the drinks taste good. Sidle round to the railings and look at Singapore stretching all around as the sun goes down

It was our last night in MBS staying here from our 6 day trip, we stayed for two nights and go told by a friend to visit the kudeta. We are not really big eaters, but boy the food surprised us! The pork belly was perfectly cooked, the prawns were dripping in it's juicy saucy goodness! After reading some reviews of the place we were a bit shocked because it was better than we expected, with VERY polite reception and waitress. Then approached Fabio, I think was one of the managers, I have to simply say, he put a cherry on top of our trip. The service he provided was amazing! Furthermore, he was not only polite, but he was so genuine and friendly! I mean, he was just a delight... He moved us to a better seat with a view and was more comfortable and also provided with some excellent choices on the dessert menu! We've had some horrific experiences in Singapore restaurants in terms of service, but this honestly tops the cake. Fabio actually made our final day in this majestic city! Will definitely be back!!!

So I went up to the Skypark deck and still was about to stop by the Ku De Ta and have drinks. The woman standing in front of the bar aggressively obstructed my way and said to me if I made a reservation with a very cold tone of voice. I think that the more ideal question for her to ask a guest would be whether if I am there to dine-in or just have a drink. right?I was surrpised by her attitude but kept my cool and said no. Me and my group of people purchased tickets to observce Skypark deck but that doens't mean that we were not going to have drinks. It is clearly stated on the official website that restaurant needs reservation but for drinks people can walk-in and it's first come and first serve.I had a previous dinner at CUT restaurant at that evening and my plan to have drinks up on 57th floor literally faded away. I lost interest drinking in this bar.A rude, ignorant staff staff who didn't even ask what I am here for. In addition, she nonchalantly commented that the entrance door for Skypark observe deck is on the other line. I felt I was treated wrong and I do not want other folks to be treated the way I felt I was treated. You can have a better dine-in expereince at other fancy restaurants at Marina Bay Shoppes Centre, but not a Skypark

We were taken here by friends for dinner and it was wonderful. We were treated like VIP's and the food and service were excellent . It was a really special evening .We had a look at the pool after dinner and a drink at the bar , yes it is expensive for drinks but you don't often get that view .Tip take a cardigan or jacket , because it really gets cold up there at night with the wind blowing !!We really liked the food and would definitely go back

We wanted to visit the top floor of the famous Marina Sands Hotel in Singapore and have a peep at the iconic pool straddled across the three towers. We thought dining at one of the restaurants at the 57th level would be nice as we could also absorb the fantastic views. We were fortunate to have chosen Ku De Ta as we had a lovely dinner with top class service, great choice of food and the wine selection was excellent
4
what made the whole dining experience superb was the service of your staff Arlan Valdez. He was knowledgeable and gave us all the options available, from food to wine and to your tea varieties. you should hire more people like him
5
Wonderful food, great view and first class service on my 40th birthday. Arlan went the extra mile with a cake to make this a memorable occasion - well done to all.
5
the view, the atmosphere and the service were amazing! the food was ok but nothing fantastic. the roasted salmon was nice though. try it if you love salmon. a great place for special occasions!
5
Loved the food and drinks. Didn't have a reservation yet we were accommodated. It made our evening. Must visit restaurant when you are in Singapore.

HiI had noe of my best days in Singapore because of our bartender. His name was Nithi. Not only did we feel welcome, he gave us a choice of cocktails, and his choice was very good.. We had a Japanese inspiered, and the old fashion with burbon. FANTSTIC.Thank you for making our stop spesial Nithy.Regards.Petter Li

first shock: Food portions were so small!2nd shock: Fusion food, not to my liking!3rd shock: The bill of course!!!My response? Stay far away from this establishment...your money is better parked at ONE-ALTITUDE who is providing you a similar aerial view...with 30% less than what KU DE TA is exorbitantly charging you....

Its my 1st time having brunch at your restaurant last Sunday and the experience was truly remarkable.I would like to thank so many staffs especially one in particular, Ms Shari. She was so patient and knowledgeable with the food and was all smiles attending to all my needs and queries. I felt so warm that she made sure that nothing was left-out in making me feel so relax and comfortable. I must admit that the cost seems pricey initially but after having to see and try the widespread of appetizers and variety of food in the menu, the generous portions and not forgetting the quality and excellent taste, its really very low-priced. I could even tell the food was properly placed on the plate that was served to me. It made my mouth water just by looking at it.While dining, I was enjoying the breath-taking view outside. Not to exaggerate, I was telling my colleague that having my meal at the 57th storey with such friendly staffs and good food is like dining on the clouds in heaven.I look forward in dining at the restaurant again but rest assured, besides coming with my appetite, I will also be better off bringing along my SLR camera.Tho

On top of a very high building, it commands majestic views of the city. We discovered it by chance during a visit to the Gardens by the Bay (recommended!). It was our last night in Singapore and we decided to end it in style. We had no reservation but managed to find a table with minimal wait (20-30 mins). We had cocktails at the bar while waiting for the table. I'm very fussy with cocktails and these were great (I had a "Geisha"). We ordered the taster menu, which was a true pleasure for the tastebuds, even the stuff that I would not normally order from a menu, like pork belly! Although they don't strictly enforce the smart dress code (many people were casually dressed, including tourists with their cameras and shopping bags), you'd enjoy it more if you made an effort (note to self for next time I'm there)
5
Here for a corporate event - I came late missed the appetizers. An extremely friendly and professional server, Junaith I believe his name was, came to me and told me to just hold tight - and he returned with a variety of all the appetizers that were served, on a small platter just for me. Wow

Great view, brilliant service and excellent food! I took my boyfriend for his birthday and we had their set menu with wine paring which gave us a great mix of different things to try. it was perfect for a romantic evening but also a great place to take friends and tourists.

On our first visit to Singapore my partner and I had a meal in Ku De Ta atop the Sky Bar with amazing views of the city. The table service was excellent but the food was average at best with a $500 bill at the end. Lets face it, you're paying for the view so the average food is acceptable.The biggest issue is the pretentiousness and unwelcoming nature of the reception staff before the escalator, after the escalator at the top and then again when entering the restaurant. That's right, multiple points of interrogation before you spend $500 on a meal for 2. We are not strangers to visiting these types of places and have actually visited the sister restaurant in Bali which occupies an equally stunning location but without the pretentious atmosphere.The whole point of a meal is to relax and soak up what atmosphere there is. This is hard if the staff behave like they are gaurds to Aladdins Cave or some dodgy London night club. We recognise that there are a lot of time wasters and that you don't need to try hard to attract customers but making people feel welcome is a restauranters occupational duty. This is what sets you apart from the rest, not the Ferrari's parked outside.My advice to visitors is to just go for a drink and eat in one of many other fine eateries that Singapore has to offer
5
Excelent I love the service the view and Junaith was the best manager the We have ever meet.
The food is good and the view of table 101 is the best!
4
Whatever's lacking in the service quality is made up by the fantastic view. I will not return for the food but for the view I might.
5
I did not visit for dinner only for drinks outside magnificent view excellent drinks and service the music is mainstream dancing

Ku De Ta has one of the most beautiful and majestic view of Singapore to dine with. It has an open lounge bar just outside and also a night club beside. I and my friend went last week on friday for dinner and quite liked the ambience. I was warned with a lot of online reviews about the customer service and the rude waitress. Honestly I do find the waitress with some attitude problem but nevertheless the overall experience was very pleasant. Before I forget I gotta mention about one Italian guy named Fabio who manages and takes care of the customers coming to restaurant. He was such a charm to talk to and was very helpful in choosing dishes. We got very friendly that we started talking about Italian serie A football. After we were done we wanted to check out the night club. But we were denied access as I lost the restaurant bill. Fabio was very kind to escort us all the way to the night club and explained the situation to the bouncer. He definitely went beyond to make our experience more fun. Thanks to him and I hope he will be around for my next visit. The night club was quite packed (probably cuz of Friday night crowd) and the DJ was not bad. Over all it was worth my money (credit goes to the view, food and fabio). I might save another day to go back again. Cheers! - Navee

We visited KU De Ta restaurant which is situated at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore. Simon the manager looked after us so well and we had a fantastic table overlooking the city. Arlan our waiter could not have been more helpful. The food was exquisite and the best soft shell crab and squid I have ever had.The atmosphere of the restaurant and bar, the views overlooking the city and the exquisite food made it the best restaurant experience we have every had!! A must if you are in Singapore!!Guy and Lizzie Gregor

My friends and I had a pre-X'mas dinner during our stay at Marina Bay Sands. No regrets. Great ambience despite the area outside being cordoned off due to the weather (drizzled, strong winds) that evening. Food and drinks were agreeable to our taste, and presentation was fairly good. I must say it was more the setting than anything else. I can't equate the view to the taste, the latter was not amazing enough. To be fair, the view at the top was simply incredible!Special mention and thanks for our waiter, Zac, for his impeccable attention to detail, friendliness and smile. In fact, I felt he was the only staff there who made my dining experience, a pleasant and memorable one! The rest just lacked the professionalism. They seemed to be "preoccupied" with worry and tension on their faces. At least, that's the impression we had
4
You can not beat this place for the view on either side. As with all places in Singapore it is expensive, you are definitely paying for the place. The drinks were ok as was the food, if I am honest I have had better Pan Asian food at that price point. Though it is worth a visit to see the place
4
A bit overpriced and place is quite noisy. But do just go for the experience. Note that dishes are for sharing. And if you order meat, you get only the meat. (Don't expect salad on the side etc. You have to order that separately). A nice evening out, but best done on corporate expense
2
The view outside the restaurant is nice of course being up at the Marine Bay Sands SkyPark. However, if you want to get a good view while having a meal, it would be better to make reservations. Otherwise, if you are being assigned seats inside and in the middle of the restaurant, no privacy is assured because you get staff watching you from behind the bar counter as well as waiters standing and stationed close to the tables while you are having your meal. The Asian food served did not justify the expensive price. You are paying for ambience provided you are able to get nice view. Maybe we did not get good recommendation from the waitress who served us. Food portions are served in the middle of the table for shared dining
5
Its one of the best places to be in singapore for dining or drink. Although sometimes it gets very crowded and you need to wait sometime for your turn to get seated even if reserved before hand on weekends. The greatest part is you are on the deck of marina bay sands building ..enjoying the scenic view with food and drinks
4
A place to enjoy the music and view. But too little space when crowded. And if you have the money, everything you can get. But the rest sometimes it's just too pricey for a drink.
4
Situated on top of the Marine Bay Sands, it has the best views of the city. We went for the Friday brunch, and used to brunching in our hometown of Abu Dhabi, this brunch doesn't come close but the location makes up for it!
3
While the food is so-so to good, depending on what you order, the views are unparalleled. The free elevator ride is a boost and when you factor that in, Ku De Ta is a decent value.
4
Good food and friendly service in nice setting. Sadly couldn't be outside due to mega storm but imagine it makes for even better experience
4
Its location, location, location. Its sky high view of Singapore that I recommend you enjoy through sunset. Its torn between being a restaurant and a bar and the music is loud and destroys conversation, but then I'm over 50 so.... The menu is good, but think of tapas. Every dish is small, but very good. The service is poor (but improving.....) compared to anything outside of Singapore. We have to tolerate poor service and high cost in Singapore and its a way of life for us. No tipping so no motivation for the staff to do anything vaguely extraordinary. You get the menu, you wait, and wait. You order drinks. You wait, and wait. You finally get a wine list and order the food. Then the waiting really begins. If you are young and have time on your hands and are really there to see and be seen its cool. If you are a grumpy old man, like me, it'll drive you nuts. Loud music, crappy service and expensive. My favorite!!. But the views! They are outstanding. Its a special location, and after all the frustration its a special evening. Breath deep and hand them your credit card. To me the most important question, always, is will you return? Yes, many times and same frustration every time. Its life in Singapore. Spiraling costs, and a blanket acceptance of crappy sub standard service. We have to make a stand!!!Enjoy
5
Appetizers were good. Try the crispy squid, love the tuna tartare, edamame was a bit salty, must work on the spicy tuna sushi. For the entree, Pork belly Chinese style was quite good but the grilled salmon wasnt that fresh, strong fishy smell. Finished two bottles of Champagnes guess the night was just fun we went there for the atmosphere all together not for gastronomy experience so a little missed here n there is forgivable.
4
made a reservation, got a lovely table, staff great. Patrick in particular was excellent. Very nice food, very good service, expensive but not for the great location and view. Overall I'd go back again without hesitation and would recommend everyone gives it a try. We'll do a meal during the daylight next time
2
Extremely overrated restaurant...I have been to many Japanese and Japanese inspired restaurants and the food was nothing flash for the price we paid ($360 for two people). This only included 2 drinks and about 5 dishes (very small). We have been to the Bali Ku De Ta and its hands down better than the Singapore one. Don't waste your money and try to go somewhere else! Your better off having a drink in the bar outside to see the view rather than eating and paying lots of money for poor quality food.
4
We have sat here and had drinks many times since the Marina Bay Sands was built and can say this is a view that is unique and of course you will pay for it.To date have not eaten here however friends advise the food is reasonably good although once again expensive. If you have been to Ku De Ta in Bali you will find this a totally different experience. Whatever you do when visiting Singapore you must take time to visit Ku De Ta
3
I have eaten at Ku De Ta several times and until recently felt the food and service were reasonably good, but pricey -- essentially the cost of the view from the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Most recently, however, the food was mediocre at best and the service has declined. Some Japanese-themed items (spicy tuna roll, vegetable roll) were ok, as was the robata grilled fish. The chicken teriyaki was not chicken teriyaki -- it was oily, fatty, and had little flavor. The sweet potato korokke were also greasy and flavorless. Service was spotty -- they were quick to take orders, but absent when anything else was needed. The restaurant is noisy -- difficult to have a conversation. Overall, food quality and service need to improve
4
It is on top of Skypark, with good food and good service. But it is a little bit expensive although the view is good. Not highly recommend.
4
Great experience. Good food, pleasant ambience & magnificent view. Special thanks to Patrick, our server for his efficient & warm service.
5
This place is amazing! The atmosphere and location is unbeatable! The food was great and our waitress Lily and her supervisor Sara took care of us extremely well. Recommend to everyone!!

Loved every moment - from start to finish.
Ambience, food & service were great. Pricey but worth it!
Dishes were beautifully presented & professionally executed.
Keep it up!

We decided to go for drinks at the Ku De Ta so that we could check out the view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands resort. Access to the bar is from tower 3 and you need a ticket from reception on the ground floor. The drinks are very pricey but it's better than paying S$20 admission charge for the views from the Sky Deck
5
Amazing location, wonderful staff and superb food.Arrived at 7pm, greeted by extremely polite and friendly staff and looked after superbly(service provided by Dephnie) for the whole evening.Suggest arriving around 7pm to see the sun going down, ask for an outside table overlooking marina (away from crowds) and relax.The spicy seafood sashimi salad, lobster Tempura were great. The desserts sublime-apple honey dessert is to die for.This restaurant in a very busy hotel is true sanctuary from the maddening crowds-a must in Singapore!!!It truly felt like you were in the singapore airlines first class suite-coming into land but the service kept flowing!!!Keep it up...
3
Made a point of meeting friends here for lunch to see view and swimming pool at the top of Tower 3. Stunning views, beautifully appointed pool but restaurant/bar area very tatty.Ordered drinks and lunch, drinks came quickly but had to remind them about lunch three time, on each occasion we were advised 'just coming', eventually some received but had to leave without everyone having received anything.Very bad responses as if this was normal.Such a wasted opportunity in a truly awesome location
4
The Ku De Ta restaurant is in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel - the three towers are spanned by a boat like structure and the Ku De Ta is at the "wide end" of this structure. We went there for lunch on spec. We were not looking our best being dressed for sightseeing and pretty hot and unglamorous. Thought they wouldn't let us in but we managed to wing it. Dress code applies after 6.00pm however. Food was very good, service was very good, and it was very expensive. We then had a drink at the bar just in front - amazing views! the observation desk is just below but you might as well have a drink at the bar and enjoy the views rather than pay 20 dollars and no drink! Worth doing if you want to spoil yourself although for dinner you would need to book well in advance
5
The next time I am in Singapore I will definitely revisit Ku De Ta. We ate sushi which was amazing. The Spicy Tuna Maki is the best I have ever tasted. The waiter recommended a white wine and it worked brilliantly. The staff was observant and polite, the location is obviously excellent and Ku De Ta is certaintly something one should experience when in Singapore. Unfornunately, it was drizzling th night of or visit and we were therefore seated inside. I am sure dining outside is an even better experience
5
We visited Kudeta restaurant during our trip to singapore last week after recommendations from friends and the only thing i can say about it is that it was an amazing experience!!!! we loved everything about it! the views are beyond description, the food was one of the best dinners we had ever had and the service was excellent. we also had drinks at the kudeta club lounge right next to the restaurant which was the best ending to a fantastic meal!!! this place is a must in singapore and my advice is dont miss it!!
4
Visited this bar on the 57th floor of MBS, amazing place........ Good view of the lazer show, would love to vist again when ever in singapore
5
We went to ku de ta for our final meal in Singapore. The views over marina bay sands were breathtaking at night and the food and service of an exceptional quality and value for money. They had a resident dj there on the Sunday night we went and there was a funky and chilled vibe up there that despite the fusion food wasn't pretentious or over worked. A highlight of Singapore
5
My wife and I celebrated our anniversary on the 9th Dec 2013 at Ku De Ta. The experience was great. Ivo the waiter was most helpful and friendly. The food was great. Personally, I felt that the taste is tuned to typical Singaporean's liking which works wonderfully for me. Will come back again certainly!
5
We had a birthday dinner at Ku De Ta restaurant, and it was amazing. The staff were very friendly. Our 10 month baby girl had fun smiling and waving at them. The food is fabulous, and yes a bit pricey. For once in a year dinner, its worth every penny we spend. The view is amazing
5
Incredibly fresh, contemporary Asian food. Certainly the best meal we had in Singapore. It was made clear to us that the restaurant imposed a minimum spend of $80pp & out by 9.30pm (our booking was at 7.30). We had no problem with this at all, being a popular restaurant with a new chef we understood its popularity & hence the restrictions. The view was amazing, ambience excellent, service outstanding & food to die for. I would highly recommend this restaurant
1
Unfortunately, this was the low point of my recent visit in Singapore. Ku De Ta has beautiful views of Singapore. However, other venues offer views of the city and I expected for at $98 per person all you can eat buffet/menu to have at least have good food. The first few items I ordered were immediately sent back, (i.e. - burnt waffles, runny omelets, ingredient separated smoothies) this was just the beginning of bad food. While the service was polite, it was very inconsistent. I will not return to this restaurant and will not recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore
5
beautiful brunch. this has the most amazing views and the drinks really do NOT stop flowing. we tried every single cocktail and glasses of cold louis roderer brut. what an amazing experience, all made better by Ivo, Alex and Fabio the front of house manager. loved it all, thank you so much. wonderful crab cakes and stea
5
Myself and two friends had a very special birthday celebration at Ku DeTa on Tuesday 17th December. We were greeted by Aneta who was charming and understated which is what you need in a restaurant like this. In fact through out the evening we were cared for in such a away that you didn't notice it. Hats off to Faisal for his clever guidance through the menu. The food came beautifully presented, and we loved every minute of our experience. The unpretentious nature of this restaurant is a pleasant surprise making it certainly a restaurant to visit again. We will be back often as it didn't break the bank either. Good Job to al
5
We were lucky to be treated to a meal here by a friend on our way through Singapore to Australia. We were able to soak in the incredible views - 57 floors up and way above the Singapore Flyer with a cocktail and enjoy some wonderful food. We would never have thought to eat here had it not been recommended by our friend, the pan asian style food was great quality and tasted amazing. This certainly isn't somewhere to go if you're on a budget but it was a great one-off experience.My one comment would be that the service seemed to be a little disorganised, otherwise it was a wonderful couple of hours for a special treat with long lost friends
5
Dined as a family and were made welcome as soon as we arrived. Food was excellent with reasonable portion sizes. Service was outstanding with the waiters ensuring we were well looked after while maintaining our personal space. Would definitely go back if we returned to Singapore
5
We visited with friends for a birthday celebration after booking online, which was efficient and easy. The view, service, location and staff could not be faulted...... and the food was simply amazing!! Thank you very much.

You order a Salmon for $40, it has no sides! Broccoli $20, Mushrooms another $15 etc. What is standard in every fine restaurant is absent here (no bread/vinegar or anything else). Very basic dinner cost $200.and oh... every 2 minutes someone asks you if you need another drink (3x the price again). They actually started to take away our food before we ere even done. 40 minutes of poor dining for two at $200! Great deal if you are in a rush and want to be rushed.Take the $20 sky terrace for the view and take your money elsewhere for some relaxing dining experience
4
my 1st visit with my wife on our 40th anniversary. friendly n attentive service thu out.even tho we over ordered n had to cancel a last dish, it was accepted graciously.food was good n portion genrously. the braised pork cheek was tender but for methe taste was a bit too 'porky'(male prok?). the entre n desserts were very nice esp. the choc cake.we had a great evening enjoying the occasion, n soaking in the great view n night. most important..my wife was v.happy. thank

Sitting atop the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, I visited KU DE TA on a recent visit to Singapore. This was my second visit, proof that I had not learned from my earlier mistake. My first visit, apart from the views available, left me underwhelmed. The food was at best average and the service was slow.This visit, I am sorry to say, was no better. Very loud music, very dim lighting, slow service and food, when it arrived, cold. Great views though there are other options for enjoying the view without spending a fair amount of money on a disappointing meal
3
This is definitively a must go in Singapore. The view of this place is absoluteley amazing, you can see the whole city from here. The service is top notch, specially Patrick. I was cold and he got a pashmina for me. Also my sushi had something I didnt like and he changed the whole fish for me. He was sÃºper friendly.He also got a complimentary cheesecake for us because it was our honeymoon. The food is just OK. Nothing outstanding. They have some annoying fans in every table that make it uncormfortable to dine
5
My family had lunch here last week, and it was a wonderful experience. We had the set lunches, which were very good value for money, and the service, and of course view, were amazing. We had paid to visit the observation deck, and then walked through to the restaurant. I think it is possible to get a lift straight to the restaurant, and save the $20 per person lift fee, which would make it even better value for money
2
I was so excited to go and eat here but the whole experience was disappointing. I was in Singapore on business so I was eating alone. First they put me up a corner where I wouldn't see a window let alone the view. I asked to be moved as I didn't want to listen to the men at the next table talking business. They moved me. I ordered a cocktail which they just didn't bring. When I asked where it was they were mortified. The food was expensive and ordinary. The wait staff were inattentive. When they took my credit card to pay it took over 15 minutes to bring it back. Again many apologies but the place wasn't busy. I got the feeling I didn't look wealthy enough for them
4
I love this place not only for the view and the food but above all the people especially the manager who extended his effort to take a memorable picture of us himself--Thanks!And yes, the chef made a special dessert for me with the 'Happy Anniversary' greeting on it--really so sweet! We' ll definitely come back here again
3
I visited Ku De Ta one afternoon after the rain had just stopped and the sky was slightly clearing up. I was with colleagues and we had enough time for a couple of drinks before we went out to dinner somewhere else. We ordered a bottle of wine, enjoyed the breathtaking views of the city while listening to the music and taking tons of pictures. We had our drinks at the balcony with no one obstructing the view. The place was not busy at that time of day, but the staff struck me as being a bit busy, perhaps they were preparing for a busy evening. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, but cannot comment about the food, however, I did get the impression that the service was a bit mediocre, not an issue for drinks, but could be if I were there to eat.The "average" rating that I gave this place is only because I did not eat there, so I couldn't judge, but since a rating is required...I had to choose average
2
I had my first visit to Ku De Ta with a group of friends last night. The ambiance and view are truly breathtaking. We were given a gorgeous table but reminded when we were seated that we had to be finished by 9:30. This is one of my restaurant pet peeves, the "don't get too comfortable" speech, but ok I get it. We were told the menu had sharing dishes so we decided to each order a dish and then a few bowls of rice on the side. The portions were really small. So we should have ordered more at the beginning. The sushi and beef starters were awesome. The rest was ok. The chicken teriyaki was not good. Our service was actually really good. The tough part came when we finished all the meals and were thinking about dessert. The waitress came over, crouched next to me and showed me what we had spent thus far. She said we were $380 short of our required $80 per person min. We asked if we could fold in the drinks we had already bought at the bar, which came to about 125. The waitress came back and asked for our receipts. I was in the middle of a good night with friends and then I had to look for the receipt which I didn't have. I felt like I was in trouble. 80 dollars per person isn't normally hard to come by but we were just having one of those nights where people weren't living it up.. ( a Monday, one person pregnant, one person tired etc) and we just weren't ordering much alcohol. I told the server we would all order dessert but beyond that I couldn't force my friends to start ordering cocktails to raise the bill. I felt bad that I was putting my friends in an awk situation. I was stressed about what they were going to do...charge us for nothing or what. We didn't get the verdict until after dessert. Our bill came to 499 and the server said it's ok, they would let us go on the per person limit. But they didn't seem happy.The restaurant is clear about the 80 per person when you book the reservation. In hindsight I should have alerted my friends or picked a different restaurant. I loved the setting and it's really special with out of town guests. But I'm not sure about a restaurant that would first remind you when you have to leave and then stop by to show you the bill and how much more you need to spend in the middle of dinner. It just seems really tacky. I can't imagine that happening anywhere else. I am sure people would sit there all night with a glass of water and one appetizer and that's rough but it's a restaurant business and that comes with the territory. We were just a group of polite moms and old friends out for dinner and trying to relax. So enjoy the view, but keep tabs on your tab

It was a great time out - loved to visit again - view was amazing - service was good and bar tender was good (Indian guy) - loved the restaurant ambience

I made reservations for Ku De Ta for two of us. I knew it was going to be expensive (and it was), but the view was worth every cent. We got there 1/2 hour early to have a walk around and see the sunset. We were seated outside overlooking Gardens by the Bay. The seats were comfortable. They provided flashlights so we could read the menu. The food was very good, but not quite fantastic. We had some sushi which was a bit disappointing, the Mizuna Salad was great, the black cod was good, and the seared tuna was fabulous. We were there for over 2 hours just enjoying the atmosphere. I'd go back
1
our experience in this place was truly awful. I think the only thing that makes this place special is the view, and yes it is pretty amazing and probably there is no better view of Singapore than the ones in the top floors of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. But the food was nothing special, since we have a chef in the family and the rest of us are just food fanatics we usually order more than enough to share and finish everything, here we didn't quite finish any of the plates. But what really made it one of our WORST EXPERIENCES in dinning was the service, the fact that the table was never cleaned or that the waiter never came to see if we needed something was irrelevant after his behaviour at the end. We had a problem with the check since they charged 2 extra bottles of water, when we mentioned this the waiter was rude and afterwards the person in charge even more he even mentioned something like "we don't need the money from two bottles" . After this bad experience we were walking out the restaurant when we heard the waiter scream at us "sr, do you want more water? Can I give you a bottle of water" and laughed sarcastically. We didn't even turn our backs. In conclusion we had never been so DISRESPECTED by any staff member in any other plac

i made a reservation here for 4 because my brother wants to propose to his girlfriend and me and my sister were supposed to capture the moment and plan everything. We had a BLAST! We were accommodated very well and they were all very helpful and excited about the proposal. it was perfect! i love the part of being high on top and outdoor while having this perfect view of the city. We enjoyed the great food and the great ambiance

Simple, Japanese influenced dishes with small professional culinary twists that you can't replicate at home. The dishes are simple, using a lot of sashimi, Japanese ingredients and don't have a powerful flavour. Austere Jap cuisine as I said. If you like to be blown away by one taste of the food, Ku De Ta isn't the place for that.The desserts were surprisingly complex in contrast though. It's quite expensive too, but you are paying more for the stunning ambience and service. The waiters would pull out the chair for me to sit

My husband and me came for his birthday ( 52 ) from Germanyt to visit Singapore and to dine at Kudeta. .We had a very great dinner and had such a friendly and professional waiter, his Name was Patrick and he was so friendlly and we felt very nice with his way of his working mood, kindly and very special reading of our wishes! It was a very pleasurefull nigt out with an amazing view over the Bay of Singapore& the gardens of the Bay . It was expensive ...but every Sing Dollar well spend.and a great night for us to remember.Super Ambience !!! I will return to Kudeta for sure

My partner and I came to Ku De Ta for dinner last week and the service, atmosphere and food were all amazing! The beef tataki was one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life! Our waiter Arlan was very professional and friendly and even stopped to have a quick chat with us about Australia. I will definitely be returning

Fusion Food was so-so and way too expensive. Place was tightly packed with seatings just an arm's length apart

We have booked a company event in kudeta. We are amaze by the ambience, but the service from the restaurant manager was the worse I have ever seen. We were being scolded by the manager of the restaurant for the guest late arrival due to traffic. He demanded an answer for the late arrival of guest. Is a shame for this kind of service in this high class restaurant to have a manager that acts this way. A pity.. Definitely I will not recommend anyone to this restaurant. . If u still would like to go. . Pls be puntual.. Don't be early and don't be late or you will get a scolding from the manager.

A smooth ride up to the 57 floors, exiting the lift the view was breathtaking. The bar area was too crowded but the view across Singapore to Malaysia was impressive. Menus arrived and since it was quite dark we were give little lights hooked to the menus, great idea.We chose the tasting menu. The food came quickly and served impeccably. Not always sure what we were eating as there were so many courses. Though we were told it was easy not to remember! The pork was a bit fatty but the tempura was excellent , delicate and delicious. The desserts on one plate were sadly, poor, heavy after such a wonderful choice of courses. Our son was treating all of us so I have no idea how much it cost. Do use the bathrooms even the views from there were magical

Went for lunch had the vegetarian bento with beef takata on the side. Nice meal overall but the mushrooms were average in flavour. The corn was excellent. Views were good and the service 5 star.
5
We had a client dinner there and we ordered the set tasting menu as every one was non-vegetarian. The food was delectable, the view of course was stunning and the service was excellent - especially Patrick and Arman.
5
What a pleasant experience! Excellent food and service, especially Lynn that attended on us with such sympathy, devoted attention and professionalism.
5
This place looks awesome and has the best view in Singapore. The service is 5 stars, the waiter, Leo, was super helpful when I said I had a gluten allergy and he recommended me exactly what I could eat. The food is good, even though I am not a big fan of fusion food, the quality is excellent. Perfect place for a date or anniversary. Have a drink afterwards at the club next door. Breath taking view!
5
Food was lovely and great to get several dishes to share. Wine not too badly priced by Singapore standards. There is a minimum of S$80++ pp which is off putting to start with but it was more than easily satisfied. To experience some of the sights of Singapore you may wish to add this to your list or head to one of the many roof top bards and have a drink instead
5
I visited with a girlfriend as it was recommended to me as the best view in Singapore. It did not disappoint. It was amazing!! We did not eat at the restaurant only had drinks in the bar. Great sunset shots. The only downside you paid for the view, 6 drinks cost $200aud but well worth it. Jet set crowd. Very flash!
5
A real ‘must do’ Singapore experience. We were greeted at the door by the manager who was friendly and helped us make a good choice of table. We were seated on the terrace overlooking the bay and decided to go for the tasting menu and accompanying wines. This is an expensive meal (approx $550 for 2), so consider your budget, but if you can budget for it then you should as it will be the highlight of your trip. The food, service and wines were nothing short of amazing, the view was amazing, the atmosphere was amazing and that’s a wrap. p.s. if you plan to visit the casino afterwards don’t forget to take your passport! They won’t let you in without it, which was fine as we were exhausted after the mea

Had dinner here 2 nights ago and it was a very pleasant experience. Nice ambience with good menu. Pan fried Foie Gras was deliciously light.It was the services rendered by Mr Ivo, the server, Mr Junaith, the Restaurant Supervisor and Mr Sashi, the restaurant Manager that makes the whole dinner special. I will come back here again if I feel rich.
5
I have spent 3 nights in singapore and ended up enjoying two of my nights at Ku De Ta. Ultimately because of Bennedict (Ben), his service was second to none. Made it soooo personal yet still very professional. Let alone the view was simply gorgeous and the weather at the time was perfect. If you are ever in Singapore, do not miss Ku de ta and say hello to Bennedict, he'll take good care of you! Cheers. Maz from Dubai

We stumbled on this bar/restaurant after failing to get into the skypark in time. Save yourself the $20 for the skypark and just go for a drink in the bar. At night it was amazing. It's the same view and while the drinks are expensive (20-25 for a standard cocktail) they're very yummy. Music is good too if you like house/dance music

Patrick our waiter was very friendly and obliging,he allowed to us free access to the KUDETA louge with bombastic view about the town. THANKS A LOT PATRICK
The dinner was excellent and the dessert was grat!
5
We had a lovely dinner with a stunning view. The tasting menu was excellent and we recommend it! Leo, our waiter for the evening was super! We would love to return with future guests from our home country.

Simon - in charge. Cool, professional and charming.
Anita - Eastern Euro babe that is excellent at her job and dresses to kill.
Great food, drinks, staff and venue.
Good tunes too.
See you again soon.

I visited here for a birthday meal with a friend who was celebrating her birthday during our trip - and I have to say it did let us down on being a really special place for a special occasion. The host was wonderful, telling us we had been given an inside table and would be moved to an outside seat as soon as they had a safe weather report! The food was great, the cocktails expensive but very nice, and the view - OMG! Has to be 'the view' in Singapore!! I had visited the top of the Marina Bar Sands before (the free bit where you just get a drink at the bar) - but this view was the best and totally worth the spend on the meal and the drinks. My friend and I sat in the light breeze, sipping our cocktails and really feeling like 'this is the life'. A Singapore must!
2
Drinks are very expensive but it is better to go up and buy a drink than pay $20 to do up in the lift and look at the view. Views from the bar are magnificent and you can walk around most areas. Staff need to learn some customer service skills at the bar. They seemed very uninterested in serving us
5
We had Sunday brunch here which was as much as you can eat, with dishes on order rather than buffet style, with a buffet for sweets, salads and sides. However, before we get to the food lets discuss the view.....its amazing. At the top of Marina Bay Sands there simply isn't a better one in Singapore. Stunning. There are two types of brunch. One with food and soft drinks (including fruit juices) and the other with champagne and alcoholic drinks. We decided to go for the cheaper option and forego the champagne. The reason is that the difference between the two is quite substantial. The food is delicious, service is good and you order each dish and can visit the buffet in between. The sweets were divine too.I can fully recommend the brunch. Its absolutely great food with a wonderful view and a fantastic experienc

We recently stayed at Marina Bay Sands and booked a table at Ku De Ta, (not associated with MBS) with a minimum spend of approx $80AUS per person. We were expecting a fab experience, but were disappointed , as we ordered a meat meal at $45 per dish which did not come with any vegetables or rice or anything, all that was extra, I got 3 lamb cutlets for $45, and my friends got duck, one of which was returned to the kitchen because it was tough but the other was lovely. The side dishes albeit tasty ,were small, more like entree size. I then wanted to go out to the observation deck but had to provide my room key before that could happen. The music was so so...not what I expected from Ku De Ta as we live in Bali and Ku De Ta has fabulous music. All in all we would have had a better less expensive experience, had we had dinner at the buffet and then gone up to the pool, as the music was better. I must say that the waitress was lovely and very attentive..but all in all not what we expected for such a named restaurant in such a great locatioon
5
I honestly don't give 5 stars that easily - but the whole experience of Ku De Ta is a must for anyone visiting Singapore. The view from the resturant of the city and bay are incredible. Having been on holiday for just over two weeks and visiting K.L, Bangkok and Dubai - I can really say that this restaurant is the most memorable and best experience of the holiday.We went for lunch and chose from the set lunch menu. It is all beautifully presented, the service excellent and .... did I mention the view
5
A fantastic evening in a unique location...what a view! The taster menu was superb, the oysters to die for. The atmosphere is super cool, the outdoor location at that height makes for a very comfortable environment. Its very dark but the little menu lights they give you allow you to see the menu and the food as well. a very very good experience....excellent servic
5
We celebrated my birthday there and I can say it is the place which is worth to visit. The food was excellent and extremely delicious, I really liked cocktail with vodka and watermelon)))) Our waiter was very attentive and caring. And the view - it's just the best view in the city! Thank you very much for unforgettable birthday!!!))))
5
We did not eat here but enjoyed some drinks at the bar. The view is spectacular. On top of the Marina Bay Sand Tower 3 with excellent service.
5
This restaurant is at one of the best landmarks.
Great food, great view, great day.
And Patrick the server was great too!
5
What an outstanding meal. Matched with beautiful wines. Very beautiful. Great atmosphere - funky and fabulous.
5
The KuDeTa Singapore offers not only breathtaking views over the marina and out into the sea over the anchoring ships but also amazing japanese food which is certainly of the highest quality. The prices are high but worth the exceptional experience.
4
Great Asian fusion food. Extensive wine list. At night it is very dark so difficult to see the meals they bring out. It is expensive, you are paying for the view, but it is a great view and atmosphere. Meals are meant to be shared and are not large but they come together nicely. Waiting staff were knowledgeable about the choices and made suggestions.
5
We booked a month in advance to eat here, so glad we did as the place was jammed packed due to the 360 view of the Singapore skyline from the 49th floor . Fortunately the restaurant is away from the crowds however I must warn diners that the music is quite loud and more of a party scene, not a problem for us because we loved it. Food was excellent as was the service. If you dine at Ku De Ta, you also get free admission to the bar which also has a great view to was the water shows and laser lights.

Asked for a nice view for our table of 10 and think we lucked out and got the pimp spot. The table was just by the ledge, at the highest point of the restaurant, and the view was spectacular - gardens by the bay, the singapore flyer etc. Luckily for us too, the weather was cool and slightly breezyThere was a tasting menu of $158 but we decided to go a la carte. We started with the pork lollipop, california roll and soft shell crab roll. All competent, but didn't wow all of us. We ordered a few mains to share. The halibut lacked taste, the teriyaki chicken was average. The pork cheek was the 1st dish with universal acclaim, very tender. The 2nd dish to wow was the wasabi ice cream. Yup, kid you not, it was really wasabi and what a kickWe had 2 bottles of wine and some cocktails and they were ok. The really good wines are more than $200-300 here, so why botherService was very goodOverall, the food was only able to earn 3 stars and the view bumped this restaurant to

After 3 years in Singapore, we choose (me and my girlfriend) to go to ku.de.ta to have a romantic birthday dinner... And it was perfect ! We have been kept inside for the food (we book outside but the weather did not allow us to eat outside...).We choose from the new menu launched last week, the pork belly lollipops (the best!) , the sushis with cucumber & foie gras (nice portion!) and the lobster tempura with fried rice (also a must try;)But the most impressive was how the sommelier Michael (from Austria if i'm not wrong) take really good care of us with some champagne and a very nice white wine from Austria (that's why i remember when he is originally from)...and then allow us to have a good table outside where they bring me a nice happy birthday dessert! That was the highlight of the night and i really appreciate all the efforts done for this unforgettable moment... Thanks a lot and we will be back a.s.a.p!
5
We had such a great experience at KuDeTa Singapore.....firstly there is no getting past the view!! On top of the Marina Bay Sand Tower 3, just spectacular. Along with that came wonderful service and even more wonderful food!! We tried many share platters and all were delicious, I don't know that you can go wrong!! A little on the pricey side, but totally worth is for the view and food. Only downside is if you are not a hotel guest, you can not go out on to the decked bar area to take photo's, unless you want to pay an additional $20pp!! A bit of a joke when your spending $500 on dinner!!

I had dinner there with my girlfriend on Sunday, the 10th of November. I made a reservation and even though we arrived earlier than planned the staff were more than wiling to provide us with a table. The table that was allocated was facing the city skyline and we asked for a change to the sea/harbour view which they promptly carried out without a hitch. Arlan, our server that evening, gave us excellent suggestions to what food to order. He was patient and provided his views on the different dishes that evening, and we went with the roasted black cod and the US prime 'brandt beef' ribeye. They were perfect. He made sure that our dishes were changed between each course and that utensils were provided together with the dishes. There was an emphasis placed on ensuring that the food and the service was perfect. Beverages were never empty and the table was always ready for the dishes to be served.The total bill came up to about $200 for the two of us, for 2 starters, 2 mains and a dessert for sharing. This didn't include beverages because we previously ordered beverages at the bar area and they graciously allowed us to bring the drinks over to our dinner table

Kudos to the service crew. The food is more than expectations and very very good service. :) Servers Fabio & Ara.

Great views and ambience for an aperitif and hors de ouvres. Expensive but well worth it for the excellent view. Try and avoid weekends, though or go early around sunset.
5
We made our table reservation 4 days prior in order to get the best table. Indeed we were given an amazing table allocation plus the attendant Ms. Carly provided us an outstanding friendly service. Keep up the good work guys!
5
I know, normally it is not great in such top locations but we got the tasting menu and it was simply GREAT, seriously very very good. Got a beautiful table outside looking over the sea and gardens. (tip: if you don't go too late and order the tasting menu you get the best tablesâ€¦.)I rarely had such great service, not even in Michelin star restaurants. a real thumb up!one of the places you plan to visit again

In short primarily went to KU DE TA restaurant for the world renowned views, unfortunately for us this didn't happen... Food was reasonable, found the staff to be very good, price was over the top.. in our case $400 for a couple, but even at this stage very happy with the night. But the night was ruined when we tried to go to a section of the observation deck to see the views that we initially went to see only to be told we didn't have tickets ($20p/p) what a joke... think somebody should have a hard look at this... my suggestion, if somebody spends $400 dollars in a restaurant that should entitle them to a peck at the views..
1
Great = View. Everything else was rubbish. They have an odd system where the person who serves yo hand makes your drink then hands over the payment to a girl at a register. I had to wait while my cash went to her (behind the 10 previous customers) and waited 15 minutes to get my change while my drink went warm in the sun. FYI They have a minimum dinner spend of $88 per person ++. Based on the strange service, I didn't bother with my reservation. Don't expect anything to be great other than the view
3
This has a point and you leave out some parts and still be successful.I have been recommended by a work colleague "this is the place to go for Sunday brunch". So my hopes were very high.Arrived delayed, and they told me downstairs that my table had gone but could check upstairs. We arrived at the restaurant and it was completely empty. What point were they trying to make?Prices are five star, the quality of the food maybe 3.5 stars and the selection maximum a five.I think I need to recommend him some better places...

Went here for a family member's birthday, mentioned in passing that it was her birthday and our lovely waiter Patrick came along with a complimentary cake with candle at the end of the meal which was a lovely touch. Food and wine were both great - food described as "modern Asia" - very Japanese-influenced. All in all we were well-looked after but the main reason for heading up here of course is to take a look at the view which is great
5
This is the place to eat in Singapore, people's! It's a very special restaurant, on the top of a very special hotel, with spectacular views, incredible food and first class service! The menu is a fusion of Japanese and Pan-Asian cuisine which produces some of the tastiest food I've ever eaten. Yes, Singapore, you certainly have scaled the heights with this little beauty, well done!!

After reading quite a few reviews on here, and having been to the outpost in Bali, we decided to make the trip to Marina Bay to check out the cocktails and the view (which is the main selling point, let's be honest!)Less than 10 seconds after entering the outdoor bar, we were shepherded away from the seats that we were walking towards (the ones with the good view that anyone would want to sit in), told that they already had covers on them because it was raining, and that we would have to sit over the other side (where the view was pretty boring).Not being too keen on this, we persisted in saying we would prefer our original choice, to which a few other staff members came over and joined in to explain to us that these seats were being saved for restaurant patrons so that they could sit there after they were finished dining in the restaurant. We were again then offered the other seats over the other side of the building.To which we said thanks but no thanks, and left.In short, Ku De Ta Singapore does pretty poor job in disguising the fact that it's nothing more than a tourist trap to fleece people by tempting them with a view they won't even get, while at the same time pandering to rich clients AND managing to treat its customers as first and second class, depending on how much money they drop (or look capable of dropping).Don't waste your time. To be honest, the whole Marina Bay Sands development is totally soulless and devoid of any actual culture, other than the culture of money
5
Wow . It has got to be part of your trip to Singapore ! Views are great . Nice brunch worth spending time over . Service good we sat outside . Approx 90 dollars incl soft drinks , coffee etc . Worth it .

Cary served us well.fantastic dinner,great view,good atmosphere especially cocktails after dinner on the deck.
Only the espresso was bad.
5
IRENE WONK (ASSISTANT MANAGER) & the staff really looked after us,we will be back.
Well worth a visit.

Hello we had a 4 person celebration at this restaurant, we paid $S800 for a pretty average meal which we kind of expected because this restaurant has a great view. They advised that our 2 hour time was up we will move you to another table, we agreed to this, paid our bill, THIS was a big mistake!! They moved us to a noisy table stand up only, after paying $S 800!!This place sucks the view is good ,the food is poor
5
I recently visited Kudeta Singapore recently and honestly saying that it was amazing. At first experience is start with the view. It is so nice and beautiful. Then followed by service staff. As you all know service is very very down in Singapore even the so called fine dining restaurants... However kudeta has made good success about service. From management wait staff they were all very very friendly but they were sophisticated as well. I meant by sophisticated is knowledge actually nothing wrong:))And before I finish!!! I would like to thanks Michael Leitner (I hope I spelt his last name correctly) specially. Because he really change this classic way of sommelier:) I mean nova days most of the sommeliers they are little bit over proud what they are doing and most of then honestly saying they do not have the knowledge. But Michael i appreciate way you handle the guest in fun way and and again I really appreciate your vast wine knowledge. I highly recommend kudeta to every one and please see the Michael for his special service :

We were looking forward to this as a good night out, but struggled to get served at the bar then got warm beer and wine, which at the price they charge is disappointing! Struggled to get served for the second drink, staff were too busy watching the barman have a shave!? Glad he was not making my drink at the time! Restaurant was better for dinner, but the quality did not match the price. I think the reality is they don't need to try to hard to get the tourist $
4
Went there for my birthday party. Service was excellent and so was the ambience. The view over the Marina Bay Harbour and the trendy vibe was completely incomparable to any other restaurant in Singapore.Food was not bad, but not amazing like a 6.5 out of ten. However such places are better known for their ambience than the food.Prices were on the high side.Overall, if I had a special occassion or a person I am trying to impress, I would definately take them there again
3
I would recommend Ku De Ta as a great spot for a drink but the restaurant is expensive and the food is typical of a tourist trap. The views are exceptional and the menu was very appealing but the Terriyaki Chicken was dry and the rest of the food was not a patch on the food we got at the Food Hall in Weelock Place Shopping Mall
5
Had a great night at the bar. Went to the club the night before and came back a second time as we had so much fun! Ben and Izda were amazing! Best service at the bar :) great views over Singapore. A must for your trip here :)

I have looked forward to coming to Ku De Ta Singapore since visiting the one in Bali. I was not sure about the location atop Marina Bay Sands because I loved the beach feel in Bali. I cannot believe I was worried about it now that I have been. It is not a cheap night out but it is worth every cent. I love the music and atmosphere of the place. The food was to die for and the service incredible. Thank you May for looking after everything tonight. You made our night perfect. Ku De Ta is my favorite place in Singapore. Love love love it and can't wait to bring all of our visitors.

Great food, great atmosphere, great views and great service from Lynn & Fabio made it an unforgettable evening.

Stayed at the Marina Bay hotel during Valentines day, Was very difficult to get a table anywhere in the city, but luckily there was a cancellations at Ke Du Ta.Service was unbelievable, food was a little delayed, which we accepted given that the restaurant was fully booked. Even though i dont think the food is value for money, i was happy to pay the price as the food came with a great view of the city. Even if you are not hungry i suggest you go for a drink and check out the exceptional panoramic views of the city
5
we wanted the view and heard that restaurant was very good. We were not disappointed. Although we arrived when it was raining & foggy, it cleared up nicely. we were seated near an outside window. We ordered cocktails - my tarty gin/passionfruit/mint drink was perfect. My friends Singapore was tasty. For 3 of us, we had 2 small plates and 2 hot - perfectly served with timing and taste. The greens salad with shitake was a dream to look at and the light dressing awesome, and we had coupled it with rolls with avocado and sesame. We had salmon - plentiful portion for 3 of us, pork cheeks - melt in mouth and squash - perfect cubes and succulent. We did succumb to sharing a dessert - Hennessey cake and white chocolate emulsion - good, but deconstructed dessert is difficult to eat/share. The service was perfect. Highly recommend. Know that it is cher

My husband and I dined at Ku de Te in October to celebrate our wedding anniversary as well as my birthday. The staff at the restaurant were all extremely kind and the food was deliciousâ€¦ but none of this compares to the view that you get by dining here!The waiter that we had was very accommodating. I was hoping to have the Bento Box lunch that was offered but it contained raw fish. Being pregnant I was not able to enjoy this part of it. He immediately spoke with the Chef and they swapped the raw portion for something I could eat. Much appreciated!After lunch we took tons of photos in every direction - truly one of the highlights of our trip.We highly recommend a lunch date here at Ku de Ta
5
All through world class overlooking downtown Singapore. We had little to no expectations. Just got in to Marina Bay Sands in the evening and called the concierge to make a reservation somewhere good. Ku De Ta is among the top asian/fusion kitchen so far this year
5
I took my Mother here for dinner recently as she was visiting and we had an absolutely fantastic night. I was bowled over by how attentive the staff were - we were looked after all night. As soon as we arrived and sat down, the Manager, Simon made sure we were moved so that we had the best table on the balcony. Not only did he come over to chat and ask if we were OK, he insisted that we pick two of the best dishes on the menu and he'd pay if we didn't like them. Unfortunately, the food was superb and we did have to pay, but I was surprised at how reasonable it was. I'll be going back as soon as possible
4
Overwhelming view of down town city and other side of sea view.Good food with nice and friendly service.The floor service - Patrick even show us around before our dinner start. He also recommend nice dessert and show us all the way to the club lounge to continue our after dinner drinks where you can see more views......by the pool!You can imaging on the top of the Hotel building - Level 57, what a view
5
We had an excellent experience at Ku De Ta. The staff very kindly moved us outside once a storm had passed seating us at a superb table. Our waiter and waitress, Ryan and Shiya, could not have been more attentive and friendly. The food seems to be getting better and better on each visit. The beef carpacio and thinly sliced sashimi were superb. We look forward to returning! Bill and Jud
5
What an awesome bar with the most amazing view .Just want to praise the five star cocktails and martinis "Nithy" the barman mixed for us, coupled with the excellent service by the charismatic Ben, made our last night in Singapore a very memorable experience. Highly recommend to anyone who likes a great martini.Billy

We hosted some guest and had high expectations regarding the place and food. First of all there are few tables that are near the edge and have view. All the rest are in the middle of the balcony with no view. If you try going to the edge to view the marina the waitresses are asking you to move.The service it self was bad. Took long time for the drinks to come after several reminders. They also missed out some of the dishes we ordered. The food itself was layed out nice but it was not tasty at all.As for the price it was not worth it
4
The bar itself is ok. However I would consider it a must because of the spectacular view of Singapore, especially at night.
5
Loved the food and drinks my friends and I had the other night. We expected something much more pretentious but the staffs were so nice wonderful especially the Italian one who served us, called Fabio. Definitely a place to come back to for a chillaxed night or even a romantic one :)
5
I had dinner on the 28th October with working colleague and my bosses. We got the best seat in the restaurant that's the only round table in there. Service staff and the food was excellent. We had a great time and I will be back on my birthday that's coming soon on November. Kudos to Simon and team!!

The most AMAZING dining experience!I don't generally take the time to write reviews, as after working in the hospitality industry for over 15 years, I tend to keep my opinions to myself and simply return to the restaurants that I enjoy. However, after to reading the ridiculous review below about Ku De Ta, I am compelled to write.Ku De Ta is a once in a lifetime experience, Simon, the newly appointed Manager has worked miracles in this establishment, contrary to the below comments!! I first visited KDT over a year ago and I have to say, it was barely above par for the price that you pay, bad service, average food and an overall bland experience. I then visited for a second time earlier this year to try my luck again, boy am I glad I did!! Needless to say, that I am now a weekly visitor.From the minute I walked in, we were greeted by a smiling, friendly and accommodating receptionist (regardless of her attire) who swiftly took us to our table, which initially we were not too fond of, so she quickly changed us to another table, no questions asked. Our waiter was attentive and extremely informative of every item on the menu, his recommendations were spot on and the food was delicious.But what made the experience most special was the Manager Simon, he visited our table once we had been seated with drinks to ensure we were happy and being looked after. From that moment on, he made us feel like we were his own private guests and ensured our experience was one in a million, constantly coming back to check on us. As I watched him work the room and touch every single table that was there, you could see that he was in his element and that the restaurant had transformed from the once bland and basic tourist trap, to Simon's own personal living room! It is unbelievable the changes that have occurred in this establishment and yes it is ALL down to the management. I must commend all of the staff, the service, the food, the attitude and the overall transformation that has happened. Hiring Simon as the manager was the best call thing that could have happened to this Restaurant. I will continue to be a loyal patron, as long as Simon is still there! GO, before it's too late

Very impressive asian restaurant on the 57th floor of The Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Make a reservation (online) and they contact you via the phone to confirm the reservation 1-2 days ahead. Report to the elevator desk and they check your name and offer free access to the 57th floor for restaurant quests. Ask for a table outside or close to the outside area. The dress code is business casual (no swim shorts or slippers) and the minimum spend is 80,- Sin Dollar. The staff are very friendly and the service is great. The price compared to the quantity of the food is somewhat high. The quality of the food is very good. The concept is to order several dishes and share together. The view and the atmosphere is excellent for a (surprise birthday) dinner or business dinner. Tip: on friday and saturday you can access the club for free with your bill from the restaurant. Or drink your coffee on the observation deck and return to the table to continue your evening.

I do not write reviews but I feel I must do my first one because this place is a rip off and if the management care about their reputation, and sustaining this business, beyond being a tourist trap, they need to fire the manager Simon and re-train their staff on what it means to give good service and serve good food. Singapore is known for food. The food here does not measure up. They have a great location with great views, why waste it on this cheap concept of skimpily dressed receptionist and waitresses, awful music and worst of all mediocre food??? Why not be the real deal??Poor Reception: Skimpily dressed receptionist was cold as fish. Simon, the manager should be fired. I can't stress that enough. He is responsible for what happens to his patrons in the restaurant and he did nothing spectacular to recover our bad experience. With a manager like this, you will have staff like this. Sorry that KDT management does not realize the damage this wait staff and chef are doing to its reputation. Simon is the worst, most unfriendly, arrogant, pompous restaurant manager I've ever met and I've been to countless "real" fine dining restaurants in all my travels worldwide. Even a cheap cafe gives better reception and service than this. I feel the staff, especially this manager, think they are royalty and are above their patrons. The ever imposing security all over the place is excessive and unwarranted. We're only there to eat! Is it necessary to rope off sections of your restaurant and bar from your patrons?? This place is ladened with the terms "VIP only", "Members only" and all to wall off who? Their patrons?? Pretentious to say the least. It's also created an extremely pretentious staff. Poor Service: What service?? My husband made a reservation for two. We were given a table with a setting for 4 right by the entrance and the bar?? Who does that?? We were here for the restaurant. There were other available tables for two inside the restaurant, nearer the windows, which were not occupied. Instead of a view, we had to stare at a family with 2 restless kids in front of us, people milling past us and the noise!!!! Unbelievable!!! They said those empty tables were reserved for their members?? It made me feel they only sit people they like at the nicer tables. Maybe only caucasians?? I noticed everyone seated by the windows were caucasian and all Asians were seated on tables??? They can say it's coincidence but I strongly believe they do that intentionally. After some fuss, they switched our table to a tiny one right in the middle of the room! What pissed me off was that manager Simon, instead of apologizing, told my husband they had intended to do switch our seats in the first place. Well, why didn't he inform us of it before he sat us down? Lying does not help make a bad situation better, Simon!!! I would've walked if not for my husband who wanted to an a nice evening out with me. The waitress was inexperienced but forcibly nice. Andi the sommelier was the only person who looked like he cared about his job. He took the time to speak to us and explained the wines. he seemed like he cared enough to find out if he could help rectify the poor experience. Food; Nothing fantastic, not even worth the cost. The texture of sushi and the rice was soggy. We requested medium rare beef but it came over cooked and dry. You can find their dishes in any regular restaurant or cafe. Some of those cafes may serve better food than this! Do the chefs taste their own tasteless food?? There is no character or signature to their menu. Ambience: None to speak of. It was dark, music was bad and loud and there wasn't views to speak of if you sit in the restaurant. This is a restaurant that tries to be hip but is not hip at all. It'll never be hip if run by inexperience scantily clan waitresses, and a middle aged, pompous manager who only cares to entertain patrons he wants to. A good manager checks in on every patron in his restaurant at least once. This one didn't bother to check in on our experience. Overall rating: Avoid this tourist trap. It's not a real fine dining restaurant if you are a foodie. Food is mediocre at best. If you want a view, go elsewhere. Prices are set like daylight robbery for the quality of food delivered. Its not the cost, its the low quality food you have to pay for that makes it not worthwhile. If you have Simon as your manager, good luck to you. Expect the reception to be cold and arrogant. If you are not their "VIP" or their "Member", don't expect to get a good table and don't expect you can just walk out and enjoy the views outside! The place is the epitome of how not to run a restaurant. It only gets awards because they probably put up a good show for critics. Two thumbs down!!! AVOID like the plague. There are plenty of good places to eat in Singapore

The view here is quite impressive. The view from the Skypark would be better (this bar sits above the observation deck, but doesn't extend to the edge of the building). My main gripe is that the bar patrons are almost made to feel unwanted. There are few places to sit unless you also done at the restaurant. The few bar tables are standing only. Maybe the lounge is the better place to go for drinks for this reason. If you just want the view I'd recommend the Skypark observation deck, but I liked being able to sip a cocktail or beer while idly watching the weather change over the expanse of Singapore. Better to spend $20 on drinks in my opinion (not that $20 gets you much at this place). There is a smart casual dress code. No shorts or thongs. Collared shirt recommended (I don't recall seeing any t-shirts). A buttoned shirt with chinos and clean skate shoes was fine in my case.

Went to marina bay sands for a day, and was surprise to see a roof top restaurant there. It was perfect since we arrived there in the middle of the afternoon so a refreshing drink was perfect for the time and location. The staff who was also Filipino was very accommodating. I was even given a tip by the staff that if I plan to go back and skip the door fee for the sky view deck, I will just have to tell the hotel staff that I'm going to Ku De Ta. Saves you the money and door fee and it has the same view of the entire Singapore

At our stay in Singapore we decided to visit Ku De Ta as we where at Marina Bay - we did not have a reservation and just walked and where lucky to get a table ! The service was exeptional .Start we had Red Snapper Shasimi what was outstanding . For Maincourses we had Lamb chop and Tenderloin what where very good. You need to order sidedishes extra.Their where no Potatoes on the menu. After we finish our meal I had to go down to meet a friend and my two friend where left alone waiting for me. The staff then ask them if the can sit 4 other person at our table what I found not correct for the prices you pay their. As well the restaurant was not apple to supply a charge for the I Phone - what I usally expect at this kind of restaurant . However I would deffintly again visit the place 
5
One of my favourite ways to experience a restaurant is via degustation. This allows for small samples of a wide variety of food and styles. The first thing on offer at Ku De Ta menu is their sampler menu. It's fairly steeply prices at $198 per person for food and if you want wine to match another $98 per person. I was in SIngapore for a conference and thought ok I'll sample. SO SO pleased I did, with the exception of one of the courses (the cod) the rest was outstanding. The sashimi snapper with truffles scored the highest of the evening as mega outstanding it was completely divine., there were so many courses the lobster and prawn tempura were mouthwatering and juicy, other shamim fabulous etc. etc. superb service and well matched wines. NATURALLY the view is spectacular and adds to the evening, but for me it was the food and its fusion style that shone:-

We had our anniversary dinner there and we truly enjoyed the food at atmosphere. The food was delicious and upretentious. Service was friendly and personal. Shout out to Patrick for his great service.
5
For a tourist trap on top of marina bay sands hotel and casino, the food was excellent and service first class. Keep up the good work, and by the way the views are to die for!!

Fantastic views and food . Unbelievable . We had great seats outside and stayed for a 4 hour brunch.

I was in Singapore for a holiday and was told by friends staying here that I had to make a trip up to Ku De Ta. When I went there I was greeted by very pleasant staff who directed me to the bar which was pretty crowded as I guess it was evening? The skyline was spectacular. I ordered my first drink (Really pricey though I suppose you pay for the view as well) the Tony Starks Pepper which was such a shocker after my first sip. I enjoyed it very much. I asked one of the bartenders to help me snap a photo with me and my drink and of course the view and the guy obliged with a smile. I asked him what he'd recommend for me to drink as my next and last and he told me I should try his specialty, an espresso martini. Although i wanted something off the menu, I am definitely glad i agreed to his recommendation. It was definitely one of the best espresso martini I've ever had. Thanks Nitty! (I think that's how you spell it ;) I'd definitely tell friends to make sure they visit as it is very memorabl

I moved to Singapore on our 2nd Wedding Anniversary and thought nothing more than booking this restaurant to celebrate both occasions.Yes, MBS is a massive tourist attraction and we accepted that it may be overpriced for what we would get and that we would mainly be paying for a view and sitting on top of glorious piece of architecture.How pleasantly surprised I was! We got there a little early to watch the sunset and enjoy a cocktail by the bar. That gave us an opportunity to take in the view, take the standard photos and relax.We then took our seats inside. We had been offered the choice of an outside table but knowing how temperamental the weather is out here decided not to risk it.After a glass of champagne we decided to go for the tasting menu with the pairing wine menu. To be honest the menu looked so amazing, an Asian fusion of dishes, that I could never have chosen otherwise!Anyway, cut a long story short, every mouthful was delicious, the presentation beautiful (I will add some photos) the staff were attentive but not at all rushing, the restaurnt is very clean and facilities perfectly fine. It is expensive. We spent somewhere near SGD 650 but we left full and tipsy which doesn't always happen in top class restaurants.I would definitely come back here once I've ticked a few other places off my list. Recommendation: Go! Book a table for 8pm and then make sure you're there at 6.45- 7 to watch the sunset and enjoy a cocktail on the deck. That's the best time to appreciate where you are.

We were visiting our son who works in Singapore & our Daughter & her partner were arriving 2 days later. Her partner was planning to (surprise) propose whilst on the trip & we arranged the venue. My son immediately said it had to be KU DE TA, perched on top of the magnificent Marina Bay Sands its a truly memorable location, the views fantastic day or night. We went to see the staff & arrange times & what we would like, they suggested they bring the ring out as a 'dessert;', this would be on a platter with 'Will you marry me' written on it.From the moment we arrived the service was second to none, we were given the VIP area & the whole night was amazing with lots of tears. The photos are amazing, she (and we) will never forget were & how her fiance proposed. Thank you to all the KU DE TA staff for making it such a wonderful evening. 1st class.
5
 From a distance, the place will already captivate your curiosity... Just wait and see what else it offers.Been to this place before, and i must say it just keeps getting better and better. It never fails to give u breathtaking and relaxing sceneries, delicious and mouth-watering foods from appetizers down to desserts, heartwarming service from the friendly staffs esp from the manager, Ms Irene Wong who made sure that everything was perfect for me and my friends the night we were there.What else to say? "just don't leave Singapore without visiting this place.
4
The location is outstanding. Close to the sea and and also admidst of the city in the Marina area. Food was very good, service very attentive. Our patron Leo Lopez did everything to make us feel happy. Even by removing the highly uncomfortable couches and replacing them with a hair so we would not go home with back ache
5
I have visited Ku De Ta Restaurant many times. The food and the service has always been perfect, breath taking views, funky music and lounge style atmosphere - creates a perfect setting. The pricing is high as you would expect at Marina Bay, but if you're looking for a 'perfect dinner & night out', I highly recommend this restaurant
4
This is my fourth visit to Ku De Ta. While my previous visits were with business associates, this was the first time I brought my family. We were celebrating two birthdays in our family and we went to Ku De Ta on a saturday evening. By now everyone knows about the great view which is the main selling point of this place. As such I normally wouldn't expect the service crew to extend themselves as they know that people come here primarily for the view. I was pleasantly surprised when the crew actually exceeded my expectations, from the time we were ushered to our table (a nice view deck table facing the harbour) to the extra attentive service we received from the staff as they tried to make our twin birthday celebration extra special. Extra kudos to Patrick, Yule and Jenny. I will definitely come here again to entertain friends and relatives
5
Went here around 5 pm so that i can enjoy both afternoon and night view. Various price of food and drinks. The view is fascinating, combination of infinity pool and great singapore landscape with lots of skyscrapers. Would definitely consider to revisit.
5
The evenings waiter, David, was phenomenal and made my 26th birthday perfect. I couldn't ask for more. Thank you.
5
It was the most delicious cuisine I have ever tried!!!! The same is about a view from the top - very nice picture, it worth to visit at least once.
5
Visiting Singapore is exciting enough, but, the Ku De' Ta is off the scale. This place is open air, on the top of a 40 story hotel. Stepping out of the elevator your are greated by Aneta a strikingly beautiful lady who escorts you to your seat. She is constantly on the move keeping the the restaurant organized and the guests comfortable.The bar drew our attention. Outstanding bartenders. When we requested a Manhattan he responded, "a perfect Manhattan of course?". "Of course we responded!" and they were. The view is to die for.Please do yourself a big favor. Visit the Ku De' Ta. And tell Aneta the bald guy from the US sent you

I recently visited the bar at Ku De Ta restaurant in Singapore on a busy Saturday evening with a friend for some drinks. We ordered from the very polite and friendly bartender, Nithy, who recommended some drinks and took our orders with a smile. When it came time for the second round of drinks, I noticed in one of the menus that a few pages were missing. I brought this to the attention of Nithy who verified that indeed, two pages were missing from the drinks menu. He offered his sincere apologies and gave us another menu which thankfully was intact. Because of bringing this small issue to his attention, Nithy was kind enough to offer our round of drinks "on the house." It was a very nice gesture and it completely took me by surprise. I thanked him for his kind generosity and because of excellent customer service provided, I will have no issues in not only recommending Ku De Ta to others but I do hope to be back again soon. Thank you for a memorable evening
5
Imagine a cocrte aircraft carrier sitting atop 3 skyscrapers. you can have a drink at the bar for less or just pay for the observation area, but it is better to just relax in the restaurant. Everything was first class and you do pay for it, but again not to be missed
5
We knew that view would be breath taking, what delighted us was everything else. Almost making the view an after thought. The service was thoughtful without being in your face. Our waiter Samuel advised us on dishes with great enthusiasm, with out any snobby overtones. He delighted in our choice of dishes stayed engaged and looked after us. The food was well presented, had good flavour and we loved the concept of sharing. The pork lollipops were yum, we totally enjoyed the fusion of east meets west. This is amplified by the skyline, of modern city landscape and calm sea views. If you have something to celebrate go, it's so worth it. In a city of speed and pace this is a tranquill haven of fine food ,professional service, a well managed restaurant . Who ever manages this place is worth there weight in gold
5
We wanted something special...and we got it!!When we arrived we asked for a table outside and the view was breathtakingFrom beginning to end our fantastic waiter Leo and the others took extremely good care of usWe felt special!The atmosphere was very romantic and the dinner deliciousWe dined so well that we had no more space for dessert but our waiter Leo surprised us with a lovely and beautifully presented series of small desserts with a candle and chocolate writing We were very touched and we found the space :-)We still have lots of beautiful images that we will treasure for lon

I wanted to bring my family to an amazing place to have a good-bye dinner before their flight home. We knew it was a famous place but we thought the view was the main key selling point. In fact, I met Diana, one of their team member, and she made our day!! Not only did she managed to give us the chance to visit their VIP place, and pool area, but she also succeeded in getting us the best table ever! Facing the view, with trendy red lights (lounge atmosphere) and not too loud for my family. She was great. Once we sat and ordered, we found the service was professional and discreet. The food was delicious, each dish was a good surprise. We had beef, fishes, muji mushrooms, salmon sashimis, fois gras rolls... and hennessy chocolate emulsion. All perfect. For 4 people, we spent about 900 SGD including 2 bottles of French wines and each of us had a cocktail in aperitif. A bit pricy but definitely worth it
4
Right on the top of the World, is the first feeling that one gets when you are on the 57th floor, the view is breath taking and the pleasure of having a drink with friend and family with such a fantastic view is a rare combination. The place is rocking and always over crowded ( I think every one wants to enjoy the place ) the staff is very efficient and the service is quick . We enjoyed our drinks with the glorious view of the Singapore flyer as back drop on one side and the beautiful view of the well lit up buildings on the other
5
The food was delicious we had the degustation meal highly recommend.
The view was amazing and the service was fantastic!
5
Dined in the restaurant, Simon & his team went above & beyond to make us feel welcome and very special. Food was great. After dinner experience the bar area & views of the night time light show -sensational. Highly recommend to experience.
2
The view, the atmosphere and the staff are amazing! But the food, well, it is far away from a good cosine. You can eat a snack there (bar).
5
You can't beat the view from Level 57, then you get to dine with it. Go at dusk, experience the changing lighting from day to night. We enjoyed the menu ( a bit expensive, but you won't get this view with this quality food very often) We paid $260 (sing dollar) for 2...we had 2 starters, 2 mains and shared a dessert. Sparkling water and a glass of wine each. I considered this good value. Food tip: the Beef Tataki was to die for, and the Sticky Crispy Squid was also pretty sensational. The roasted Salmon was a winner as was the prime rib.....tender as.....Dessert was interesting, but by then I was pretty well done!I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to my best friends or anyone for that matter. The total experience is right up there
4
My wife and I ate here. We wanted to see the view from the top and enjoy a nice lunch.The restaurant won't give you much access to the roof top even though it is up there. they keep you restricted to just the restaurant which is a bit disappointing, unless you pay extra for the outer deck. Still the view is excellent.My wife had a salad and I had an Indian Bento Box.The food is nice, but it is nothing spectacular. The curry Ran dang was served on paper that got wet and mixed in with the food, not at all correct.The dessert was a curry ice-cream cake of sorts that was unusual and actually very nice.Staff were attentive and friendly.I liked it, but I would not go back or recommend it. The decor need improving, it is very bland
4
We loved the food! We shared some dishes and I particularly liked the foie gras and the tuna, both very very good. The desserts were also incredible and very light. After the dinner, we went to the bar outside for a couple of drinks and the view there was amazing. I also liked the service and the atmosphere - would go there again
5
After a disappointing experience last year we tried again by booking on the F1 night. Price was close to S$300 per person ++ and the total bill reached $1,800.- for 4 people including wine. Service was very good. We and our guests has a wonderful night
4
Head to the Sky Bar for an evening drink. Although drink prices are steep you get to enjoy an amazing view. You can only stay in the bar area (not visit the observation deck) but it is worth it see the nighttime skyline. There is a dress code in effect, you don't have to be fancy, just presentable. Nice slacks, shirt, dress, etc. no flip flops, shorts, etc. NOTE: there is also a nightclub here on the opposite side of the Sky bar
5
Ku De Ta restaurant was a great choice for our anniversary celebration! We booked for 6.30pm, just to catch the sunset at the bar before heading to the restaurant. Everything came beautifully, from the appetizers to our main course with sides plus desserts. Highly satisfied with the overall service, especially our waiter, Patrick, making sure we were well taken care, giving us necessary advice on what would be good on the menu
1
We ate here because of the views but we were disappointed as you couldn't see the views from all the seats, the level the music was playing at was so excessive to the point that we couldn't have a chat.The min spend was pricey but we thought we would easily reach it.....when we placed our order we were told we were underspending so were told to order more food (we couldn't order more drink as we had to leave the table within 45mins), to cut a long story short, when the bill arrived we had ordered FAR more than we had to for a min spend and ended up with additional food which we did not finish.Getting the bill and paying was a slow process also. I cannot believe how much money we spent there for an alright meal with no views and poor service.Avoid!Go to Equinox instead....amazing views, amazing service and staff and outstanding food and drinks on offer, oh and no silly minimum spend nor kick out time from our table
5
I must say we didn't book, just walked in and got a table inside. We still had a nice view but, gosh, the food was just superb. Ordered from a taster menu we tried a lot. Every piece is melting in your mouth. I think the best I have had so far. They do warn that the minimum spend is $80 but with the drinks we spent a lot more and it is so worth it. The manager then took us to the club so with the receipt provision the entrance was free. Great music, a bit cramped but lovely crowd and atmosphere.
3
Kude ta had a good veiw. Better stay away from the cocktails and order wines or something else. We were in KU deta twice and drinks were not upto the standard. Good veiw though!!!Drinks are very expensive here as compared to other five star bars in Singapore 
2
Chose to visit Ku de ta instead of paying the ridiculous entrance fee to go to the top of Marina Bay Sands. We got a bottle of sangria (not very good sangria) and the views are obscured by the public viewing deck. If you can only visit one place for a view of Singapore, don't make it this one. The drinks are really expensive (close to $20 for a beer)
5
I have lived in Singapore for several years and know what to expect from resturants on the island. Given that family had arrived for a few days I thought Kudeta would be a good option for an evening meal and drinks. Called the day before and made a reservation for six people. Was informed of the S$80 per head policy. Table booked for 7pm and requested an outside table with good views. Arrived with my group on time and was seated inside due to bad weather. We were given a brief but informative overview of the menu and were waited on hand and foot. Food was outstanding, wine was paired well. After the meal we requested to have drinks on a table outside. Fabio the assistant manager dealt with the request and we were given a table outside which had fantastic views over gardens by the bay. All in all a great evening. Special thanks to the service staff Faisal and Carmel who provided excellent service throughout. Also thanks to Fabio who kept a keen eye on ensuring our group had a good experience. Will definitely visit again

I'd previously heard a lot of negative feedback from others about Ku De Ta especially a from a few years ago. However, I decided to give it a shot anyway because I was entertaining a couple of my closest friends with whom I've enjoyed various nights atop high rise bars and restaurants in various cities. I booked primarily for the view and figured that any kind of service and half decent food would be a bonus.Well what a wonderful suprise we all had! Everything was fantastic, from the initial greeting at reception, right through to the farewell at the end. I asked to speak to Simon, the manager at the end of evening to thank him for the wonderful job he and his team are doing but unfortunately, he was busy elsewhere at the time. I've been living in Singapore for 6 years and i've been very disappointed with the general low level of customer service i've been receiving in Singapore so much so that I tend not to expect good service these days. It was therefore so refreshing to receive the amazing service that I was used to from high end venues in Europe. In particular, our waiter, PATRICK was faultless. He was polite and friendly, explained everything thoroughly and offered some useful recommendations. At all times, he was extremely efficient and seemed to preempt our requests! He also joked around with us, while never ever being intrusive and I can honestly say that i'd be tempted to ask to be seated on one of his tables next time! I haven't even described the food which was absolutely fantastic. There were 4 of us, each ordering a starter, main, plus a few sides to share and dessert of course :-). The portion sizes were just right and each dish was cooked to perfection. The favourite for the night had to be the lamb - you have to try it!The pricing was reasonable and we were fortunate to have a table outside overlooking Gardens by the Bay and beyond. Even the lighting, mood and music was fab..... just nice lounge-type music playing in the background at the right volume. No complaints. A magnificent experience and I really hope this wasn't a one-off and a sign of continuing impeccable service from the Ku De Ta team - Thank You!

It's on the top of the world, or the bottom if you see things that way- you notice it as you leave the airport and then you find out you can have heavenly cocktails and a splendid dinner there- so you just have to go there.They great you like old friends and treat you like your special- all of you.  Cocktails have an Asian twist- I had a giesha- no idea- but perfect and with a crysathamum floating in it, the JD and coke for my partner Amanda was a generous measure. Your then 57 floors up, with the lights of Singapore laid out for you as you sip your drinks under the stars in the colling breeeze. Is it the best place for a cocktail in Singapore? I think so.The restarant is sumptuous, the staff attentive, the food modern asian- fantastic, save room for puds though.Simon- the lovely man in charge will make sure you have a great time, and if it wasnt the other side of the world I would be a regular.So really- you just have to go there

We have eaten at dozens of "great" restaurants but Ku De Ta topped them all.A drink at the bar before dinner was great to soak in the views. We booked a month out because of the f1 and still got an 8.30 slot. The views are spectacular from the deck but very little from inside the restaurant itself.Waitress was very attentive and not over the top, the Sommelier was excellent and guided us well.The Felton road Pinot was superb and went well with al the courses we had, from prawn to duck and fish. I rate it as one of the best meals we've had and on a par with A meal we had at Rockpool several years ago in Sydney. I had a mental budget of $500 for 2 when I booked and ended up at $580 so not wildly over budget but still a lot of coin for a meal, it was more for the experience than anything and it's one we'll remember for a long time
5
You could imagine the restaurant and staff could rest on their laurels having such a spectacular back drop of Singapore at 656 feet, BUT as the food and wine appeared the view dimmed into the background. Simon, the restaurant manager warmly greeted us – his attention to detail unparalleled. Our waiter Leo guided us through the extensive menu with experience and patience, his recommendation of the “Pork Lollipops” was an evening high. Andi the sommelier had the difficult task of matching three peoples pallets to the amazing food – his recommendations truly topped off the evening. There are not enough superlatives to describe our evening, Simon and his team have set the bar to an all time high
5
It was a dream come true. I have always wanted to experience Ku De Ta and it surpassed every expectation. Simon (restaurant manager) is the quintessential host who made our night very special. Andi our sommelier deciphered our wine desire and paired three beautiful wines to match our culinary delights. Leo our waiter was attentive non obtrusive and well versed in the menu. The food was out of this world. Recommendations to all to experience this restaurant. DJ Deepak topped the evening off with fantastic house beats. Thank you team - one off the bucket list
5
I was surprised like others to find bad reviews about the food and service. Firstly we we lucky enough to get a 7pm reservation the night we flew out (as the sun was setting). Secondly if you get a booking I recommend getting there earlier for a drink at the bar and take in the view which is in every direction. If you can also get a reservation for when the sun is going to set even better.The service was flawless. Professional, courteous, attention to detail all while giving you the space to talk and enjoy the experience.Food was exceptional and I recommend the chili crab (of course right??). When in Singapore this is something to experience and I think a must do at least once...we will go again
4
I just spent a few hours at the bar with some friends.
I understand that you pay for the location, but the quality of the drinks could a bit more at par with everything else.
For everything else, the service was good and attentive.
4
This is an amazing location and setting, the food was excellent and service was also very, very good - quick, efficient, polite and friendly.
4
This reasturant/bar gives you a great view of Singapore (day or night). In Marina Bay Sands to go up to the observory deck you are required to pay a small fee but when you take the other lift and enter through KU DE TA, just order a drink and you get to enjoy the same view. Chill and opt for an open air seating to enjoy the cool breeze up in the sky (unless it's raining or hot sun then best avoided). If your on a budget go for the Bar instead of reasturant. They serve alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink. I had their house special flower tea (with free refills of hot water) which was totally worth it
4
Amazing view and glad entry to the bar was free. We were not staying at the hotel so we unfortunately did not get to see the pool which was what we were really hoping for! Service and drinks at the bar was excellent although tables were reserved from 6pm for dinner so only standing at the bar area was available
4
I always start by reading other reviews first, just to judge how far off base I might be in my opinion on something. So, I was quite shocked to read criticisms of both the food and service while huge kudos for the view. It just goes to show you that not everyone has the same experience...We had exactly 16 hours on the ground in Singapore between the docking of our cruise ship and the departure of our late night flight to Beijing. After some research, I decided that this was the one restaurant I wanted to try for a "once in a lifetime" dinner. I'll start first by explaining what were the two disappointing aspects of this experience.First, shock of all shocks, was "the view." Be warned: Not every table has a view and in fact some are so intentionally blocked from "the view" that you could be in a subterranean food court. Perhaps I should have asked specifically -- bigger the fool, I. Our table was tucked away in a quiet corner with a view of a 6' high solid hedge. Just a fact -- we did not enjoy the view. Again, I fault myself for not asking directly about this at the time of reservation and check-in. Don't make my mistake! Second, and a somewhat minor point since I obviously succeeded in scoring a dinner reservation at my desired time, the process of attempting to make a reservation by email from the US was totally (***TOTALLY***) unsuccessful. The information I received back was so convoluted and poorly translated that I just gave up. It is only when, wandering through the mega lobby of the Marina Bay Sands, we happened upon the reservation desk at 11am and inquired about an opening that we were *delighted* to be accommodated. Again, I should have specified "view table" as this was our one shot in Singapore for a skyline gee-gaw. Oh well, stop complaining, you got the table.From here on, from our perspective, this was a nearly perfect dinner experience. If you read my restaurant reviews you know I believe deeply in the philosophy that good service will compensate for poor food better than good food will compensate for poor service. Happily we experienced an exceptionally well-balanced delivery of both excellent service with delicious food. Our server, Sithra, was warm, open and engaging -- she would do well in the very finest of restaurants and falls nowhere in the obsequious or condescending service zones. From the moment we sat down she made our little corner table worth every expensive dime. She brought us individual reading lights (yes, they are wise to keep the lighting down as the real light show is outside), made extensive recommendations on the complex and varied menu and timed our service impeccably. She was never pushy but she was more than willing to be directional and assist us. The only criticism I have of the service is that in this calibre of restaurant in the west one would expect to see floor managers and busboys working in greater harmony with the direct wait staff -- not true here, Sithra was a one woman show. We enjoyed the opportunity to also engage her in a discussion about her home country of Malaysia, which we had just visited, and on the life of a typical restaurant worker in Singapore (commute, et al). Her language skills were top flight. Frankly, without her, the experience would have been more of a 6 than a 9 (with a view it might have been an 11...).So, food. There is a truism that food is rarely up to the view when served atop a landmark. Those who remember Windows on the World will know what I mean. Perhaps its just hard to cook above the 50th floor. But we found our dinner to be worth the price (pricey pricey pricey) given the combination of locale, service and quality. While we were tempted by the $158S pp tasting menu, we ordered ala carte so we could try a few things that were particularly tempting. Remember, we can't get foie gras in California anymore, so this was an illicit opportunity for us, and one which delivered hugely. We had: Hamachi, Yutaka Roll, Prawn Salad, Foie Gras, Pork Lollipop, Scallops, Prawn Tempura and the Hazelnut cake. Yup, we overate. Sithra helped us gage our food and suggested we might be overdoing it, but this was the best we could do at restraint -- again, I'll write it off to the altitude. Also note, the food came out quickly. Not too quickly, but there was no real rest in between courses. If you want to rest, I suggest you be clear with your server. We were given not a dinner time, but a dinner window -- 7 to 9pm. In other words, welcome, but be gone by 9. It happens when you are a smoking hot property. Dinner total for 2 with a glass of wine and a non-alcoholic beverage, plus a built in 10% service plus 7% tax, was $284S (about $225US -- really, not outrageous for an all in dinner 57 floors up over Singapore...).The icing on our cake was the service we received post dinner. When we hinted that we were slightly disappointed at our view, Sithra took us ***personally*** over to the SkyClub so we could get a full on view from the bar (the fabulous pool terrace on the 57th floor is still exclusively for hotel guests). I'll upload a view photo so you can see what the hubbub is all about. But it was so amazing of her to give us this extra piece of personal care when we were all done with our meal and she was on to the next table. THANK YOU, Sithra, we really appreciated that so very much.You can have a great dinner anywhere (almost), but you can't have a great dinner 57 stories up over Singapore in an iconic building. Don't miss it

The location is spectacular, but not matched by the cuisine and service. In the dim light we found it difficult to read the menu and the waiting staff were unhelpful when questioned about the modern asian menu options

Our last night in Singapore and we were 'highly recommended' KU DE TAYes the views were amazing and breathtaking, which is the very least I can say about the food and service - Shocking, Appalling and Very Disgraceful !!!Heavily over priced, very dark to read the menu or to even see what your eating. The food had 'No Flavour' I wonder if the "Chef's" have actually eaten the food themselves ?? Totally embarrassing & ripped of for paying $80.00 ++ per personNow for the service ... 4 of us at the table & only 3 of us received service of laying the napkin across our laps & resetting of the cutlery. I call the waiter over & asked if he had a problem with my partner with regards to missing him both times. He apologized & service was the acknowledge (a bit too late)As for the "Blonde Chech Chick" hosting when we went to pay the bill & informed her of our complaints she ... "Rolled her eyes" and made no apologises. Thankfully the Manager Simon stepped in & took over. His extended apology and access the to KU DE TA (VIP) bar was very much appreciated - thank you for this experience & the free drinks which ended our night on a more pleasant evening. But seriously; Chef's need to improve or removed, Wait Staff & Host's also need to lift their game or move on. KU DE TA has a lot of work to do to impress me and my friends No on My Recommendation List at all !!

A group of us went for a birthday buffet brunch, it all started well with us being given a nice table. However at these prices I don't expect to keep asking again for drinks to come. At one point with at least 6 staff stood around and no eye contact from anyone of them for some time, had to resort to waving my arms around. Food was very average, they may well have the smallest choice of buffet items in Singapore, cocktails free flow quite nice which was just as well even though again we had to order more than once to get served.Moved on into the club lounge which at 5:30pm was manned by a very rude DJ who clearly is allowed to play what he alone likes to listen too. He played at least three tracks without every looking up to see who his audience was or the impact the music was having. In the main it was couples and hotels guests who either did not stay for a drink or left after the first one.Had it been 11:30pm onwards then it would have been ideal but do they really think clients need that sound at 5;30pm I guess they must because when I asked the DJ he abruptly said it was exactly what the management and clients wanted. I did try talking to some one at the desk/door but she only offered "I have no opinion" which seems a strange thing to say to clients who just spent $1,200 on a very mediocre offering

We were staying at the hotel and had an early flight and chose to eat at Ku de Ta as we were very tired. I can't believe I was charged $40 for very average sushi, my local sushi bar is ten times better, 20 for two small bottles of water even though later I saw them giving jug water to other tables and the list goes on. I am happy to pay for great food but 200 for what we were served is a joke. It was a huge disappointment. I will not be coming back and will definitely be telling my friends the same. The hotel itself was fabulous would stay again but avoid ku de Ta like the plague

We dined at Ku De Ta yesterday, for our 25th anniversary, and that choice definitely helped make it a special evening. Must disclose that the occasion - and the fact that they were able to seat us early - are biases in their favor. Bias against, was that we were coming from pre-dinner drinks at Raffles, and were more than a little sorry we hadn't elected to stay and eat there.Needn't have worried. The 'modern Asian' cuisine at Ku De Ta was just delicious for Western palates that don't care for spicy, and we were pleased with every single dish, which isn't always the way. The atmosphere is chic, relaxed and intimate, with soft lighting and spacious-feeling table placement. Enough light to see what we were eating, but dim enough to really see the views and sunset. Views from the outdoor bar area were really spectacular! As a recommendation, it would be a nice touch if restaurant guests had access to The Skypark observation area, as the bar does get crowded, making it hard to get to the rail all 'round, for photos and gazing. Seems as though it should be easy to negotiate something and just include a reasonable fee in the service charge?The standout of our experience, however, was the service. Again a bias, since our server (Patrick) was kind enough to bring us a surprise special dessert when he discovered it was our anniversary - complete with 'Happy 25th' written in chocolate. But even apart from that unexpected yet highly appreciated gesture, he had that knack that all really good waiters have, of being present and efficient with the service (we waited for nothing and our needs were often anticipated) and giving info as to how dishes are served, what certain unfamiliar items were, etc. without hovering, bustling or in any way rushing us or spoiling the relaxed and enjoyable ambiance.First-class!Overall, Ku De Ta lived up to its billing, and we now understand why it was hard to get a reservation

The staff, Irene and Leo where fantastic. The food was very generous in serving size. We asked to be relocated to get a better view halfway through our meal which was accommodated without hesitation. Will definitely recommend to friends.
5
Ordered the Champagne brunch. Fantastic service , the champagne , cocktails and food just kept coming from the moment we arrived till service was over. Great views to complement the food and drink . Would recommend this to anyone who wants a indulgent Sunday .

Fabulous Asian food wit stunning views of the Singapore Skyline. Situated on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands this rooftop area is popular with tourists wanting to catch the stunning views. Dining is also available outside on the rooftop with the area being roped off from the tourists but I chose to dine inside with the air-conditioning. Ceiling to floor glass walls ensure that the inside diners also have wonderful views of the Skyline. Bookings are essential and I suggest that you go for the inside tables. The hustle and bustle of the bar, rooftop area was not what I wanted for dinner but I appreciate that others would love this. Service was very attentive and the food was superb. We had sticky chilli squid as well as pork hock lollipops, pork belly, deep friend scallops which were fabulous and savoury rice. A fantastic meal in a wonderful setting and highly recommended for those wanting to see Singapore full in the face. Give it a try. You wont be disappointed

6 of us came to Singapore on an exploration trip to see what's new in the world of restaurants and bars so naturally everybody recommends this place. In short, for tourists who are not looking for a good meal but want the view, the atmosphere etc. - sure thing! for those of us who actually appreciate the art of culinary and service this was a huge let-down.You come out of the elevator and are treated like a sightseeing visitor on the top of the Eiffel Tower. The girls at the hostess desk - perfect. Tables outside a mess. Too dark, placed on wooden planks which lift the chairs and tables you sit on, every time a staff member passes by. Light nearly non existent. They do provide little reading lights but common - I also would want to see what I eat, not only read about it. Service was just plain and simple a disgrace. We had a booking for 10:30pm (last possible table) and lat order must be called at 10:45pm. Fair enough. We showed up at 10:15pm and were seated. Ordered our food and when we wanted to add a couple of dishes at 10:37pm we were told that the kitchen no longer accepts orders. Seriously Ku De Ta - reconsider your table timings. The food was average at best. No flavours, presented on dark plates to match the dark surroundings. All in all certainly not worth the crazy amount you have to fork out (we only had one bottle of wine (SGD 100) and not a lot of food and the bill was SGD 900 for five of us because one chose not to eat. Sad that Singapore's number 1 address is such a huge let-down
5
This is my third dinner at Ku De TA - and again it has been consistently good. Thanks to Simon McKinless and his team for the consistency. Food is well priced for the location. Ring up in advance for a seat with a clear view - but the bar before hand and the night club after dinner makes it a great night
4
I would definitely recommend this place if it is your first time in Singapore - the view from this rooftop is priceless!This was my second time in KU DE TA after 1,5 years and the food is great Asian Fusion food tapas style - very tasty and with good service. Same goes for the cocktails - a great Singapore Sling! And we´ve got a table without a reservation. We just turned up in normal street clothes not being dressed up much even though I would usually do and recommend that for such an occasion.Anyway that seemed not to be an issue and we were heartily welcomed.The only downside: You have a minimum spent of 80 SGD per person. Said that, we´ve easily topped that with 2 cocktails (25 SGD each) and food leaving with a bill of quite exactly 100 € p.p.However I enjoyed it - the relaxed atmosphere, club music and views are just phantastic!If you don´t the price it is a must see in Singapore

1. Regarding the view which is considered their strong point: factually the view from the bar and restaurant is over the LOWER DECK-TERRACE occupied with various tourists from the hotel and after you see the city view from one side and Marina Bay from the other. The restaurant and bar itself does not have direct view over the city and the port but it's through the deck-terrace full of tourists. And you don't have access to that deck-terrace, because this is exclusively for the hotel guests and people who have special ticket to access that terrace, which factually has the DIRECT panoramic view...2. Regarding the food and beverages: very delicious but overpriced. 3. Service: very good, attentive but the atmosphere is not friendly. 4. However the strongest impression from Kudeta Singapore we had was they said they don't have BREAD! There are rolls, sushi, sashimi in the menu, however they don't have ginger. There are fish, seafood, meat, etc in the menu, however they don't have bread!!! One of the famous restaurants in the city which doesn't have bread is too much...We have recently been in Ku De Ta in Bali - a very good place in contrast to the same in Singapore. Very sorry for Kudeta of Singapore..

This restaurant is for special occasions. Its got wonderful asian fusian food, grand sky views and costs a bomb.Right on the rooftop of the Marina Bay Sands, the latest addition to Singapore's skyline,this restaurant has simply great food. It was crowded on the friday night we went, but you have to make a reservation for any night.The hotel even controls the entry to the lifts (elevators for those who speak American). But that is because it is located right on the top, and is next to a viewing deck, where the general public wishing to view the incredible citylights have access, if they buy tickets.Those eating at the restaurant get the view for the price of the meal, but if you are there only for the view, its cheaper to buy a ticket to the viewing deck.But for a really unrestricted view, ask for a table on the outer side.They have outdoor dining, and it isn't raining in Singapore, its best to sit out. If they can't offer you an outside table, just goearly, and order a drink at the outside bar, and enjoy the view while you wait for the table.The service is prompt. The Wine list is long and expensive, but you can order wine by the glass, which is quite affordable. The starters are mainly see food, done creatively, and we made a whole meal out of assorted starters. The scallops were plump and cooked to perfection- lightly battered and fried, served with a hint of sauce.The smoked salmon were waifer thin, pink rolls. The prawn was naturally cultivated, not out of an artificial hatchery. The vegetable kylan- a kind of chinese spinatch was excellent, as was the shitake mushroom,served with rice.The desserts were unusual, wasabi icecream, mango sorbet, green apple or mango lime pudding.Be warned: you have to order a minimum of 70 singapore dollars worth of food per head, not including the wine.And the dress code asks for elegant smart casual- which means you wear shoes, a shirt & trousers that reach all the way down to your shoes. A dress is just fine for ladies

before we went to the Ku de Ta club, we decided to have dinner here first. As we are not too familiar with the cusinine, we let the manager recommend a selction of small dishes so that we can try out different dishes. The food was interesting and delicious, a bit unfamiliar to our plalette but it is full of flavour. The staff were attentive and friendly. Recommend to go during evening for that amazing sunse
5
The most striking structure out in the city, Marina Bay Sands is a must see for anyone in the area.I had dinner up at Ku De Ta, and went to their nightclub a couple times during my one week stay there. I was with a lot of locals which was a huge plus, and the service was amazing at the club.Champ Wu (club manager) Farhana, and Sara were all super helpful and fun to meet

Amazing views & atmosphere.
The food is really nice & so are the cocktails.
Staff were friendly and good service.
Would recommend going for dinner.

Found the place by accident when the daily downpour hit. Good atmosphere and drinks. There are more venues for every taste in the area.
5
Hi! It was great having my dinner and I am very happy with the service provided by a staff name Ivo! He was very detail in everything! I'll definitely patronize ku de ta again!
4
Everything in the restaurant is well studied and nicely arranged.
Food varieties is great, a little over priced.

The view from Kudeta is still fantastic and we had an enjoyable time admiring the view and snapping photos. However, we left hungry! On Wed 28 August 2013, I had invited my friend from London for lunch. I specially chose Kudeta.Since I had tried the Bento Lunch on my last visit, we selected The Lunch Tasting Meal instead for $58++ per person.The small servings were an embarrassment for me - as I was giving my friend what I thought would be an impressive meal.We had to SHARE the meagre plate of salad. The appetizer was ok. But my main course of salmon was very small – definitely NOT enough for one person. My friend’s main course of pork belly was not crispy and extremely fatty. She could hardly eat it. The dessert was small in portion too and the taste was not to our liking.This is my 4th and worst meal in Kudeta. We had to adjourn for an early tea as we were still hungry.Altogether a very over-priced and very disappointing meal
1
a most disgusting experience. the table setting was on a bare table with no place mat, and following the first course the USED fork and knife were set on the table to be used for the second course. The second course on the set meal was told be be 'shared' along with the set meal 'desert'. . They 'pushed' the bottled water on everyone for over $10 and refilled the glass even though I requested not to do so. Maybe they didn't understand English? in Singapore? Save your money. The stall food is better
4
Went there with my lady for a simple celebration. The view was superb and probably because we were given a strategic seat facing the beautiful Singapore skyline. Recommended to go reach there slightly earlier than 7pm so you get the experience the changing night sky. As usual food and drinks are expensive but service was superb in my opinion, it was kind of personalised and we were well taken care of by Patrick. Overall a lovely experience
4
I would recommend the Sunday Brunch. For $88 (non alcoholic) or $148 (alcoholic) you get access to beautiful views, unlimited food and unlimited drinks (including cocktails, coffees, smoothies, fresh juices, sangria and beer, depending on what package you go for) for a total of 4 hours. Given their cocktails usually go for around $25 a pop, if you think you can drink 6 in 4 hours, you've already covered your costs. The service was great. We were given the table we requested, food and drinks were served very quickly and a really friendly waitress was constantly hovering to see all our needs were catered to. Views stretched out over the city, the sky trees and the ocean. The food was not out-of-this-world spectacular but it was yum and I really enjoyed it
5
Restaurant is on 57 floor top of Marina bay Sands with a perfect view of Singapore and over to Indonesia and MalayaWe had my 55th birthday there with the taster meal and taster wine, perfect combination with the sunset, music, ambiance and peaceful surroundings. Was one of the best dinning experiences I can remember and not at a stupid price! So tasty every morsel enjoyed to the last lingering taste. The sommelier selected some fine tasty brilliant wines to complement each courseParticular mention to Irena the manager who went out of her way to ensure we had a first class experience, she is such a wonderful person and made the evening so memorable even timing the meal perfectly so we could go to Phantom of the Opera in time.A wonderful experience, we will be back (and did for a sunset drink the following evening
5
I visited KuDe Ta for my Brunch on 25th August 2013, I was greeted and welcomed with so much of warmth and willingness to provide best services, Food was good however service was excellent. I decided to sit outside initially, eventhough i was by my self, i was given a full table with great view. After a while I realised it was way too hot for me to be outside hence i requested a table inside and within few minutes one of the staff escorted me to a lovely table inside. Little bit expensive but worth a visit
5
A great place and a quite amazing view!
Very erood food with salmon and tuna fish .
A very nice welcome and a friendly service.
Appreciated..!
Will come again .

The food and service was amazing! Irene Wong was a great hostess and we will be coming back for her!

I had a dinner in this restaurant while was staying in the marina bay sands hotel. It's amazing in service. Mrs Ivo serviced me very well and thank u for that. The food is ok
4
We celebrated our 16 aniversary with our 10 years twins in a lovely warm night in S'pore and it was very nice.You need book adavnce since it is a popular destination for foreigners and locals; it is not well located since you need get there by taxi, but if you are at Marina Bay Hotel is fine.Outdoor tables are very attactive due to warm evenings, but remember that in warm evenings after some time you can feel uncomfortable dining and swetting; additionally, the bar is at the same area, thus be preprared for others clients bumping into you table either to take a photo or due to not enough space to accomdoate all. Inside tables have the benefit of air con and more reserved, but you don't have the best view.It is loud anywhere, but it is part of the nice atmosphere that they offer.The food is a mixed on Asian fusion, but with emphasis on Japanese. The wnine list is good, with several options from budget to expensive lables; champagnes are very popular and expected in such places.Anyway, it is a postcard, but a little bit priecy
4
Well worth the visit- outside bar is nice with fantastic views and not too crowded. We ate outside which added to the atmosphere and retained the views. All tables inside and outside are non smoking. We were a little concerned that we may be paying for the views rather than the food and service quality - we are glad to say this wasn't the case and we had a great meal. Tapas style sharing plates which you can order throughout your meal. Fair value for Singapore - there is a minimum spend of S$ 80 per person. Consider visiting here instead of paying the entrance fee for the sky park - view is the same and you can enjoy some nice drinks and great food. We didn't visit the club - we are too old
4
Singapore generally doesn't have good customer service, but i was very impressed with customer service at Ku De Ta. Selection of food is great and everything is very delicious (Pork, garlic mushroom is very tasty). We actually had to make a small complaints because toothpick was found in one of our appetizer. The manager came to apologise in person, in fact we were offered free dessert and all the food bill was taken out from our total bill. Everyone was very nice and friendly, professional. I will definitely go back again, and introduce this place to friends who visit Singapore
4
The options for visiting the too floor of Marina Bay Sands is to stay at the hotel, pay $20 or visit this restaurant. We opted for the last choice. We were seated quickly and our drinks were also obtained and delivered to us quickly. The menu is extensive with a chalice of set menu, bento boxes and a la carte. We chose a la carte. The idea is to choice three or four dished between two and share. They deliver each meal out, one at a time. Portions were a great size not feeling that we over did it. Flavours fantastic especially the tempura prawns with yellow curry sauce. The only complaint was that they rushed us in the end. It was 2.30 and I felt they wanted to close the restaurant though they were serving meals outside.We took our drinks to the balcony where we enjoyed a wonderful view and cold drinks. Lovely afternoon and a restaurant that I would recommend.Always enjoy a restaurant that is fully staffed and who are attentive
4
This is definitely one restaurant where you need to make a booking, in advance, to get the table you want for the best view. Being on the 57th floor gives you an amazing view of Singapore, especially at night! It was very busy the night we were their, Singapore National Day, so we had a bit of a wait for our table but this wasn't an issue over a glass of wine while checking out the Singapore night skyline. The staff are very good and knowledgeable when it came to asking questions about the menu and wine list. A good menu and wine list with some very good options. The food was very good and the courses flowed allowing time in between to enjoy the wine and the view. The price is on the expensive side given the choices available in Singapore but the view from Ku De Ta is hard to beat! A must for any visitor to Singapore...at least once

I was contemplating between Exuinox at Swissotel and Kudeta. A dear friend of mine Eveline recommended to go for Kudeta. We were so glad to have listened to her. My gorgeous date and I were pampered by the friendly staff. The ambiance was great and we managed to get a cozy table with a beautiful sea side view, thanks to the on duty manager Maurice.We had the on promotion champagne which was excellent, followed by diner. The Lamb rack and the tempura tiger prawns were yummy.At the end of the meal the staff surprised us with complimentary dessert to celebrate my dates birthday, that was a very “sweet” gesture on their part…Hahaha…..Oh yes...the restaurant is expensive but worth a dig for a special occasion.Once again Kudos to the lovely staff at Kudeta for making the special evening perfect
4
We went to Kudeta for drinks at lunch time. The staff are very attentive especially Leo, he is a Filipino guy. I have ordered young coconut as I find it too hot to drink an alcohol. It was so refreshing! I was so eager to eat the coconut so have requested if they can cut into half , which they did! We enjoyed having our drinks at Kudeta. We didn't have a meal but looking at those plates they were serving, the food look lovely. I would recommend that you must go to this restaurant, it is on top of Marina Bay Sands.We bought 2 tickets to go to the top of Marina Bay Sands before we found out about Kudeta, so we didn't use the tickets and just gave the tickets away to my friend's friends. Make sure you ask for Kudeta restaurant if you would like to drinks or dine. No need to purchase tickets because whilst you are in Kudeta you can actually see the view, unless you would like to go around the Marina Bay Sands pool then you will have to buy a ticket
5
The great view and great food needed a great people orientated manager. Enter Simon! Your staff are superb and you are a pleasure to deal with. Thanks for making us feel special every time. One of the best restaurants in SEA.
5
Amazing bar and restaurant on top of one of the worlds most iconic buildings. A very special night, with great food and wine. We opted for the tasting menu, which was superb. Highly recommend this place!

We went to Ku de Ta in Singapore on the last night of our honeymoon. It was a very special experience. The view was breathtaking - a stunning location. The ambience of the restaurant was excellent - chilled, sophisticated, fantastic music and subtle lighting. Staff were extremely attentive (except for the last 20 minutes or so where they were a little less attentive) and were quickly on hand to pull out and push in chairs, fold napkins and pour drinks. The menu was very attractive and it was difficult to choose from a great variety. The food we chose was absolutely amazing. We can quite honestly say that it is the best food we have ever eaten, especially the pork cheeks. Staff then reserved a table outside for us and we stayed for a few drinks looking at the spectacular Singapore skyline. Overall, a wonderful evening. Thank you to the staff who looked after us. An unforgettable honeymoon experience
5
We had dinner here and were seated at a table with a view of the "Gardens by the Bay".The food was very good and the atmosphere as the sun went down was terrific.Dining up here felt special which added to our dining experience. Our waiting staff were sensational, the kind of folk you would hire yourself because they were helpful, professional and added to the enjoyment of our meal. Highly recommended. I'd happily go again ;

Amazing place to have dinner, great views to make you trip to Singapore memorable!Though I was a little disappointed because this is a mostly tourist restaurant, the food was good but not amazing. All dishes don't have sidders and this was not informed when we ordered. Service is not the best too and you pay more than it's worth it. Regarding the dress code, me and my friend we visited in the afternoon and booked downstairs a table for that evening and they pointed out his shorts and said it was not allowed. Of course we would still go to the hotel and get dressed to go out for dinner. It was so unclassy to see so many people around dressed up as if they were in a beach bar, men with shorts and even flip flops. They should be strict with this with everyone, it loses a lot with this atmoshphere.I would recommend to go for drinks only because the view is actually outstanding and worth it
5
At the end of a hectic week in Singapore a colleague and I decided to head to KU DE TA for a little R&R before heading to the airport and home. The food was beautiful, clean clear flavours with a twist and beautifully presented. The restuarant's philosophy of shared plates meant we both had an opportunity to explore all the options. Stand out dish for us was the blackened cod. Service was excellent - and then there was the view which is totally spectacular. From our prime position we could look out over the bustle harbour. Not cheap but worth it for the experience
5
We went to Ku De Ta at Te Marina Bay Sands for our anniversary dinner. Located at The top of the Marina Bay Sands with breathtaking views of beautiful Singapore, this is an experience to savor. The food is Japanese fusion mainly and is of very good quality. The prices are high but not outrageous, which in Singapore they can easily be. After dinner wander outside to the bar with the best views of a city skyline to match anything that a Hong Kong or New York can offer. We are definitely going back soon
5
We had dinner at Ku De Ta as our final dinner after a week in Singapore. We splurged and had the tasting menu with the wine pairings. Price wise it is in the more expensive end of the scale, but what an experience! The food was divine, the wines were exceptional and the service was, well i can't think of another superlative to describe it. Overall, a dinner that was memorable and worth the expense
5
The view at the top of Marina Bay Sands has its own reputation and is a must see.Just go to the city end of the lobby floor and take the lift to level 57 restaurant. Great views, comfortable seating, excellent service from Karen and the food surprisingly reasonable for a good restaurant in Singapore

For the full review, please visit http://grumblingstomachs.wordpress.com! First thing I saw was the pyramid of macaroons. I had to help myself to it, and it did not disappoint. The next one was New York Cheese Cake,It looks pretty, but tasted average. It was a little too stiff for my liking, and the topping did not go well with the rest of the cake at all. The White Chocolate Raspberry Slice looks really good, but I must say the thought of eating white chocolate made me excited. I took a slice despite not being a fan of non-cheesecake cakes, I really shouldn’t have. The “white chocolate” was really just a thin slice on top of the cake, though I expected the cake itself to have white chocolate. If I liked cakes, this would have been a great slice. The raspberry was delicious.Their Laksa was interesting, it did not taste like the Singaporean Laksa nor the Penang-styled one. It was the first time I had Laksa without soup! The paste was made from curry and shrimp and it tasted good. Still, I don’t think I would eat this over and over again because I prefer the traditional Penang Laksa.A tip for anyone who thinks they want to try the chicken sandwich, eat it without the chicken patty. Yes, without. The bread was crispy and the egg and cheese went well together. I just had problems cutting my sandwich into half because of the chicken. Note: it’s impossible, don’t try unless you bring your own knife from home. Even then, it might not work. I passed my sandwich to my sister to try, and when she failed she asked if she could have another knife, a sharper one. (Sidenote: I had to pass my sister my sandwich because they forgot about hers . It’s probably for the best that we didn’t have two of this dish.)If you only could try ONE thing from Ku De Ta, it has to be their fusion tea. Especially after a filling buffet, I would recommend this over coffee because of it’s lightness. Coffee would have been rather overpowering as a post-meal drink. In any case, I did note down some of their mixes that I found interesting. I picked Fruit Symphony for myself, and it is “a fruit convert of raisins, apple, rose chips and orange peels. Sweet and ripe with citrus finish”. I loved it!For the full review, please visit http://grumblingstomachs.wordpress.com

We were in Singapore for the weekend, decided to check out the famous Ku-De-Ta for a drink and enjoy the view.When we got the bill it was a bit shocking, because it's expensive. The view is fabulous other then that the drinks were just average the cocktails, you can get elsewhere. It’s worth a visit, if one hasn’t been

Came here for a business dinner. Maitre D' Simon McKinless set us up with the best table in the joint on a balcony overlooking the insane view. (Can't imagine there are bad views anywhere here, but this one was incredible, and extra kudos to Simon for taking care of us when I told him it was a special occasion...) Everyone got the Prix Fixe menu. Food and wine were good -- exactly what I expected at the top of the world in an environment like this one. (I could eat about a hundred of the pork belly lollipops, I must say...) The veggie option (one of our diners was veggie) could have been a little better thought out given the price tag

My wife and I visited Ku De Ta at the end of our honeymoon. We wanted a memorable final experience and we were not disappointed. The desk staff could not have been more obliging and secured us a table in a prime position outside. Our waiter - Leo - was a faultless blend of knowledge, personality and service. The meal itself was utterly delicious; line-caught wild snapper sashimi and crispy sticky baby squid to start, black cod and roast kurobuta pork belly to follow and whisky baba and warm bitter chocolate cake to finish. We ran out of superlatives as the meal unfolded. Wines were perfectly matched and, once again, the service was faultless. One of the more expensive nights out on our honeymoon but the one we will always talk about first. I would return in a heartbeat

A special treat for my birthday. We made our reservation for two a week in advance by email from Australia for 6.30pm to catch sunset. We had the best seating position with a view over the Gardens by the Bay and thousands of ships at anchor. Our table was al fresco with perfect weather. Our timing meant we could take in the view during the daylight and then enjoy the lights of the city, the gardens and the ships. It was a Tuesday night but the whole restaurant filled within an hour or so. Initially we were told we had to be finished by 8.30pm. Zac, our waiter, later fixed this so we could stay as long as we liked, apparently we are nice people. Oh! I haven't mentioned Zac yet.....Zac was absolutely perfect, young, polite, friendly and happy with very good English due to his time spent in Australia. After Zac explained the menu we chose the shared tasting menu - about 9 small samples of a lovely assortment of dishes . This commenced with my first ever sashimi experience of the freshest snapper and salmon followed by treats like pork belly lollipops, wagu beef tenderloin, yummy calamari, sushi and a salad served over an hour or so. Two small desserts were served to finish. Zac then totally surprised me by serving a lovely little chocolate cake complete with candle, it was hard to believe my birthday could get any better. Yes! This is an expensive restaurant but all things considered, location, lovely food and fabulous service... a true delight. Thanks Baz and special thanks to Zac for making it truly lovely

This was my first trip to Singapore and my meal at Ku De Ta was my last evening meal and it was the icing on the cake of a wonderful trip.The Asian food was absolutely fantastic, you could really taste the ingredients- so fresh.The views were out of this world and the service was great.The assistant manager Irene Wong was just so helpful in helping us choose our dishes and her recommendations were just spot on for us. Irene and her staff were very welcoming and made us feel very much relaxed. Irene took the time to explain things and nothing was too much trouble

Food - Top quality minimalist fusion food using first rate ingredients. The baked black cod (as main) literally melted in our mouth. The chopped yellowfin tuna tartare & mustard miso (appetizer) was so fresh that it literally "swam" in our mouth. But the 150 day grain beef tenderloin was rather overdone from what was requested. Overall, prefer their fish to beef dish. Ambiance - This is the pieces-de-resistance of KDT. Romantic set up in a minimalist and chic interior. Located at the Level 57 of Tower 3 of Marina Bay Sand, it offers a stunning unobstructed panoramic view of the lion city. We were fortunate to be there between 6:00 pm - 8:00 pm - we've literally witnessed the variance of day view, sunset view and night view (being the best). Price - On the high side. For dinner, the restaurant imposes a minimum spending of SGD80 per pax. Given the price tag, it would not be a challenge to achieve the minimum spending - a drink (even the sparkling spring water), an appetizer and main would easily add up to more than SGD80 per pax. Service - Could not find fault with the service. 5-star service. Note: (a) Reservation recommended. (b) Dress code: Smart Casual - no jeans, no shorts, no slippers, no tank top etc

Popped up to Ku De Ta for a cocktail; definitely overpriced (30 Singapore dollars for one!!) but views were stunning. I'd advise going as sunset approaches for fab views of the city day and night

With a lovely view of Singapore city from the 57th storey of the Marina Bay Skypark, you really couldn't ask for more, if you want a great birds-eye view of Singapore.The food there is also quite delicious and tasty. I was there with my family for their Sunday a-la-carte brunch and I would recommend their foie gras, oysters, mussels and desserts (especially). The chocolate pralines are good, and so is the cheesecake.For a more in-depth review, check out the review on my blog: http://www.prischew.com/food/buffet-brunch-ku-de-ta

East meets West restaurant with a 360 degree view of Singapore, even the Singapore flyer can't beat the vantage point from " the Boat". Very pricey, it's the experience that one will treasure. Food is on the average to a little above average scale. Our steaks were grilled to perfection and exactly to how we wanted it. Service is way above average. We were fortunate to be assisted by a very knowlegeable and charming guy named Arian Valdez. He went above and beyond what's expected of him and provided us with service that is truly something that we are truly proud of. He is an asset to the Restaurant and to the F&B industry, in general

I went with my friend to Ku De Ta already knowing that it wasn't going to be the best restaurant in Singapore, but we wanted to check out the view. The views are amazing, other aspects of the restaurant...not so much. They were out of their "new signature" dishes and alot of the wine selection was also not available. Sushi was ok, but the other dishes were more for looks then taste. The wait staff were also rude and for a hotel of this caliber there should have been at least one cute waitress right??? The manager also likes to play lounge music at a decibel in which you will find yourself shouting if you sit inside. This restaurant could be alot better and hopefully management will get its act together
5
First-rate fusion food, great wine list, and the view from the Skypark at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is simply stunning.
4
Good place for drinks. Lots of older Europeans with younger local dates (possibly compensated?). Not much of a place for dancing. Above the Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino. The view is awesome. Stay here. The pool is also on the roof for hotel guests only. Amazing

We went to Ku De Ta on 13th Aug 2013 for my birthday celebration. During our booking, we have requested for a table on the left terrace, which give a good view of the city/ garden bay but wasn't given one. It was disappointing. The surrounding views at most of the tables were blocked by shrubs or guest at the bar so you don't get the feels that you are actually dining on a restaurant with panoramic views. Moreover the restaurant is not at the edge of the building as there's a public deck below. Therefore you will not get to enjoy the view as you dine, rather it makes no difference from any alfresco restaurant. (unless you are lucky to get the left terrace table). Having said that, it was afterall worth a visit.As for the food, it was delicious and good. We were impressed by most of the food we ordered. Overall the meal was superb. On the service side, the waiter, Patrick was very friendly, accommodating, respectful, humorous and awesome. We were treated very well. A pat on the back, Patrick.When the Manager realised it was my birthday, an in-house slice of cake with candle and happy birthday wordings was delivered to our table. It was really a very thoughtful act.Thank you for the wonderful evening

Place-good spot, nice view of singapore's finest places, very relaxing sceneryFood-very enticing, well presentedService:I'd like to commend Ms. IRENE WONG (manager) for being very professional, accomodating and for that wonderful experience during our visit. And LEO (crew) who's also very professional, friendly and for that great customer service.I'll definitely be coming back and will surely bring my family and friends to this place when they visit singapore.

Ku De Ta is spectacularly located on top of the Marina Bay Sands, on the 57th floor, overlooking downtown Singapore and Marina Bay. Normally you come to a place like this for the view, not the food, and they can even be real tourist traps. Therefore I was pleasantly surprised when we enjoyed an absolutely excellent meal there. We had the tasting menu, and every single course was delicious. On top of that, the wine list was very impressive, with a wide selection for every price level. Then you add the view on top. Hard to beat

The building is fabulous a real landmark in Singapore. But we were really disappointed after our visit to KuDeTa roof top bar. Of course the view is absolutely great at the first glance. But when you Think about it you don´t get the feeling that you are on a high building. The bar doesn´t reach to the edge because of the public deck under the bar. The drinks were ok but slightly overpriced and the staff was not very attentative or friendly. They were ok, no more that than that. The worst about KuDeTa is that I didn´t get any feeling that it is a top end bar or that it is an exclusive bar. It was slightly chaotic and crowded with tourists with no dress code at all. I got the feeling of a beach bar in Kuta or Ibiza. Than there was no place sit and relax and enjoy. You have to hang at the bar or on a few bar tables. I wouldn´t go back. but on the other hand why pay 20 S$ to go to the public deck when you can get a drink for that money. Perhaps it´s better late in the evening when the crowds disappear, but definitely not for a sundowner

Popped in for a cocktail on a 24 hour trip to Singapore.Amazing location and great atmosphere - spoilt somewhat when I was delivered the wrong drink. I might normally suck it up but for $25 I wanted my correct order. We advised the waiter who's reaction was horrible. At first it looked like too bad - then I got the evil glare as he stormed off and we waited 15 minutes for the right drink and a snarly delivery. Not cool!Anyway got over it and enjoyed the experience after that

I have heard high reviews of Ku de Ta from family members and friends. However my experience was not that highly positive which I'll explain shortly.My husband and I were staying at Marina Bay Sands and my husband wanted to bring me out for a dinner at Ku De Ta at skypark. So I called to make reservations for the restaurant and I had specifically requested for an outdoor table. The staff confirmed that we would have an outdoor seat just as we requested.We arrived punctually at the reserved time, only to be shown to a table for 2 in the lounge. When we repeated that we had requested for an outdoor table and that it was confirmed, they gave us an impatient and retarted look. They were just not bothered with what we had to say and ignored us. The ladies at the reception counter were awfully rude and arrogant. Another arrogant madame walks up to give us our menu and starts fiddling with a reading light to clip onto our menus. My husband told her that he didn't wanted the reading light and he's fine without it. She ignored that and replied rudely that she is going to clip it on anyway. He repeated his request firmly again and she backed off.Also Ku De Ta should inform their patrons about their compulsory minimum spending charges they impose on their customers. When making the reservations, the receptionist did not say anything about this. My husband and I ordered our food and our total order came up $110. The same madame walks up to us to say that each person has to spend a minimum of $95++ and therefore for 2 is $190++. She said that she will still proceed to bill us $190 even though our order was $110.Now I found that ridiculous for a restaurant that claims to be exclusive. I don't see the logic in imposing on your customers and forcing your customers to spend a minimum amount. We had to order a few extra dishes to make up for the balance as there was no way I was going to give them the money for free. I ate beyond my regular appetite and ended up being sick the next day. It was an unnecessary trouble that could have been avoided. All we wanted was a nice lovely dinner but it ended up being stressful especially with the poor attitude of this sickening staff who were not a bit helpful with the exception of one waiter - Mr Yul. He noticed what was happening and he was very helpful and sympathetic. He went through the menu and tried to recommend light meals that we could eat without over stuffing ourselves. He was amazing and he was simply superb in his service.Ku De Ta, your entire staff should be picking up some useful tips from this guy Mr Yul as to what extra mile service is all about. There is no reason to be arrogant and rude. The service factor was missing here and your staff should realise the importance of their customers and that it is the customers that keeps your restaurant running. What's the point of having a stunning view when the miserable attitude of the staff is set on ruining it

So most people visit these place only for view sights Than there is no reason to visit Kudeta as you can buy ticket for viewing deck and even with access to poolFood in restaurant is not worth money and washroom is like in ChinatownGenerally speaking I was quite shocked with that tourists can access hotel pool but it good experience because I was planning to stay next trip in Skypark Hotel but now I know that these place not provide any privacy and not worth i

We are very familiar with KuDeTa in Bali - which has gone badly downhill in recent years - but the one at the top of Marina Bay Sands hotel is brilliant. The views are stunning, the service excellent and the food was very good. It wasn't outrageously expensive either. No more than you'd spend in Melbourne at a good restaurant. We went early - soon after 6 - and got a great booth style table with a wonderful view of the bay. Patrick, our main waiter, was the best - really professional but charming and friendly at the same time. we look forward to going back
5
No better way to show off Singapore like a dinner at Ku De Ta. Especially for someone as special as mom! Our server was awesome, ask for Patrick in your next visit.
5
my husband and I had a wonderful brunch during the Singapore National Day. half buffet and half a la minute hot dishes to order. good portion sizes and buffet spread tasty. very good and attentive service of noriline. we even got last minute tickets for the evening show of planes and fireworks with a glass of champagne with thanks to the assistance of shari. will be a pleasure to return the next visit to singapore
5
The food was simple, but elegantly prepared and good. The place was cool, overlooking the beauty of Singapore in the evening. The waiter, Leo was very friendly and accommodating. We were treated very well . He was very respectful and really nice. Ms. Irene Wong, on the other hand, gave us a very warm welcome. She was very cordial and welcoming. We were very satisfied with everything from the table setting to the staff. We will surely want to go back again
5
My sister booked Ku De Ta for Sunday brunch and it was an excellent choice. In addition to a good selection of cold food at the buffet, unlimited rounds of cook-to-order items can be ordered from the brunch menu. I really enjoyed the raw oyster and foie gras. You can also take a walk on the patio for the breathtaking skyview of Singapore. Price is on the high side, but well worth for the food, location, ambience, and service

my hubby and i celebrated my 39th birthday at the topmost of marina bay sands and its called "ku de ta" restaurant..we had a great drinks and a good set of meal.though it's really simple food but it has different taste,world class.we seated at table just for a couple only,the ambiance is nice,the server with special mention LEO is the name,he is very accommodating,.that was one of our great dinning experience
5
I joined friends last Friday night for a fabulous dinner at Ku De Ta. Simon the Manager was a perfect host and our table looked out over the sparkling city and harbour. The menu is stunning and by having share plates we got to try lots of delicious dishes. This was my second visit and was just fabulous. Thank you Simon and your staff for taking such good care of us. Certainly no more expensive than other high end restaurants. I will be back! Pam B

I have been here three times now and the visits did not fulfill the expectations once and that's how i came to my review. I have to admit the staff always gave us nice tables. Though things get complicated even when u leave the lift. There are about 10 different people asking you where you wanna go and you have to explain it all over again. And you can't access the skypark anymore from the restaurant which makes it less worth to dine there.Well to cut things short, somehow the staff is not very organised and you miss a warm hospitality. Either you have people all over your table or then no one around though you see them standing in a corner. Don't ask for anything that is not on the menue as you'll be told it is an Asian restaurant (..), staff was even laughing about us and you feel akward. Then they just fill the glasses of champagne so full that by the time you drink it, it is hot. Every waiter passing by had the urge to refill the glasses it seemed. We told them several times. But for water we had to ask for refill. Courses are served too fast. you have to ask for breakes in between.For the food...it is okay but really not more. The sushi was certainly not fresh, the meat was not served warm, same with the rice and fish. Dessert nothing special. Overall we did enjoy the view and the music every time but the service and food could be better so that it is a true lifetime experience
5
My partner and I had 2 days in Singapore and did the tourist attractions and found Ku De Ta on our travels. It was the best part of our weekend in Singapore and an amazing way to finish our 3 week holiday!! We were greeted by the host Aneta who was great and made sure we had an amzing table, after we sat down at our table that had the best view one could ask for we were greeted by Brenda the most attentive and polite waitress ever!!! Who made us feel very welcome. Then Michael the sommeliÃ¨re was a bundle of knowledge and selected our wine and sake for us (great suggestions by the way) the food presentation was perfect and the taste even better!!! The service provided by these 3 plus the view, food and atmosphere was (as the title says) AMAZING!!! It is on the expensive side so I wouldnt reccomend it every night (unless you can afford it) but definitely do it once if ever you are in Singapore!
5
We only had time for a couple of drinks and some pizza but the staff, food and the venue were all wonderful. An impromptu visit from a friend, not much time, very pleased we decided on Ke De Ta. I'd been before and had a fabulous dinner. Even though we were there just for a drink, the staff were superb
4
went there, the view is fantastic, service is good, I have to admit that the place is exceptional, the food was nice too. Indeed it is expensive, you will have to spend 240 SGD....but it worth it.You can be at the terrace and get the view of the city or the bay. If you prefer one or the other, better to book. The food was good, just avoid the vegetables tempura not terrifi
3
We had drinks with friends and certainly admired the view. But it came a cost, eg, three beers cost around SGD 70!! It's probably nice to do once, but I don't think we'll be back.
4
Can't beat the view. Bit expensive but worth it for the setting and scenery! Colleagues who went there at night said tunes were great.
5
With the magnificent view, great food and best service, my fiancee's birthday became extra special. A very special thanks to 'Kuya Patrick' and the rest of the crew for giving us the best service, the 'birthday' dessert plate & complimentary coffee.
5
Scenery is spectacular. We love the tasty tapas style menu. (Read: Sharing is caring!) A special shout out to the lovely Raquel who makes our every visit magical.
5
My husband and rate our dining experience at the Ku De Ta restaurant as one of the best in the world. we have travelled extensively and never before have we been treated to such wonderful hospitality (by Simon the Manager, Brenda a wait staff member and finally the sommelier Michael Leitner). We had pre dinner drinks on the deck with the most amazing view of Singapore, the east coast of Singapore and the bay. After drinks, Simon (the manager) organised a romantic table for two again with a view! The meal was superb and the wines our Sommelier Michael helped us select very much complimented our meal. Thank you to all at this landmark restaurant. A location and dining experience providing everyone a very good reason to visit Singapore
5
Went for drinks and dinner , 57th floor view to die for and food and drinks to match. Not cheap but worth every dollar , fantastic service especially from our waiter Ryan Michaels, just sensational and he made it a particularly special night as did all the other staff. Great tune from the DJ as well really made it such a cool night. Do yourself a favour people and just go!!!!
4
Since Ku de Ta is part of such a Singapore landmark we had been eager to visit during our short stay in Singapore. As we arrived early we went to the bar for a drink And the view is incredible! Unfortunately it took us around 20-25 minutes to buy and pay for our drinks - as there didn't seem to be any system in place. We were taken to our table and again the view was spectacular! A very well informed waiting staff explained the menu and took our order. The starters and mains came without delay and were delicious - although I would say the portions were fairly small. We decided to just have coffee and finish our wine. The staff were very attentive and our waiter asked us if we wanted to move to the club lounge! After settling our bill we moved through and it was wonderful. Uninterrupted views of the city and some great (if slightly dated) tunes from the DJ. We had a great night at Ku De Ta - I'm just not sure if it was worth the 700 dollars it cost
5
Actually no words are needed to describe our experience at KU DE TA with exceptionally stunning view over the skyline of Singapore. Everything was perfect: view, food, staff. Food and drinks certainly have their price, but the entire experience is worth every penny. You should not miss out on that spot if you visit Singapore. Will go back for sure
5
I recently took my girlfriend of 4 years here to propose. The staff made it so easy and were so amzlingly organised. The night was fantastic and everything went smoothly. The food was incredible. We felt like royalty. Will definitely go back one time when we return to Singapore
4
You have to come here for the views and the ambience. Great service but the food in my opinion leves a lot to be desired . I found the tempura batter a bit too thick and the yaki rolls average at best. The salads were nice though with large enough portions. The mains were strictly ok. The salmon was overdone but the scallops just nice.They have min spend of 80 sgd per person which we easily exceeded drinks about 20 entrees 15 to 25 and mains upwards of 35 just for an idea. It's a roof top restaurant with stunning 360 degrees view of the singapore skyline (arguably one of the best in the world.reservations are recommended and the place can get very crowded on weekend
5
We spent a fantastic diner on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel at the Ku DÃ© Ta restaurant. I recommend to have a drink first at the bar to take advantage of the almost-360 view of Singapore and the bay. Very good food and excellent service. Patrick was our guest and he's great - many thanks to him. By the way, music during diner is also very pleasant. Don't miss the experience
5
We booked a table at this restaurant for our last night in Singapore. The location and atmosphere were perfect, very romantic and classy. When we sat down and tried to decide what to order, the staff was kind of pushy about the tasting meny and a champagne promotion. Anyway, we did choose a maki roll as an appetizer and then steak. For the rest of the night the staff was excellent, the slightly uncomfortable start was quickly forgotten. The steak is probably the most tender steak we have ever tasted !! The price was bit stiff, as expected. But we would definitely say it is worth it, and we will absolutely return to this restaurant when we have the chance in the future. If you are thinking about going to this place for dinner or just drinks, you should know they have a minimum spend policy; $ 80 / pers

Knowing that friends were starting their honeymoon in Singapore, we knew what their wedding present would be. A night on us at Ku De Ta, our favourite restaurant and bar in Singapore (and gluten free eats, AMAZING!). What more could they want, funky beats, incredible views, yum food and the only evening of non rain that week. Having liaised with the SERIOUSLY helpful manager, Simon our suprise, honeymoon drinks and dinner plan was hatched. On catching up with the honeymooners, they said it was the best night they have ever had. They felt like royalty from the moment they arrived and looked after from start to finish. They loved every minute and thank you Ku De Ta for all of your help and making their honeymoon start with a bang
5
If you wish to visit gourmet heaven then ascend to the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel complex the next time you visit Singapore.Ku De Ta is the total dining package--fabulous setting with superb food,extensive cocktail & wine lists,all professionally delivered by attentive staff.You can always sense a happy team even with the 'boss' present and such was the case on our most recent visit.And Simon the Restaurant Manager is the man,a true professional who enjoys his work which carries through to the way the staff perform.A happy team usually delivers up happy customers,and such was the case with us.Everything is relative and in this case we really felt we got 'value for money' for such an unforgettable evening in such a unique location
5
new asian tapas were tasty and well-prepared, service was very attentive and excellent. You are paying for the view of course, although you have to buy a separate ticket to go outside to the viewing deck
4
This was our second visit, having had an an amazing night there two years ago. We had Leo as our perfect Host - attentive, polite, friendly. Food was superb, not cheap - but the view and location speak for themselves so we didn't mind a bit. The free desert (provided unexpectedly when they learnt it was the last night of our honeymoon) with "Congratulations" chocolate was a very impressive example of exceptional service at this great restaurant. Music? Yes, louder than a lot of other "pricey" fine dining establishments, but it certainly didn't interrupt us or cause a moments concern as we chatted easily across our table by the windows edge - I guess everyone is different. I'd urge you to dine here - thanks Leo you made our night - well done to the whole team, see you in Thailand!!
5
come for the bar, the restaurant is ok, but the bar is really enjoyable with descent prices, considering you are in the 57 floor with the best view in town.i would consider a visit at the end of the day, sometime after 5, when the view is better and the bar is not that crowed
5
My husband and I had dinner at Ku De Ta Restaurant, atop the Marina Sands Hotel/Casino complex on 7/13/13. The view was incredible, overlooking Singapore Harbor and the Marina entertainment complex. While the food is expensive, the quality is worth the price. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The wine we had chosen was not available that night, so the wine steward suggested an alternate wine, which was the same price and type and complemented our meal. The whole staff, especially Ulysses and PJ took care of us very well. The restaurant is adjacent to the bar, which is not ideal, due to the loud music. The staff politely discouraged bar guests from interloping at our table during the sunset, airshow, and fireworks. Make advanced reservations, as it may be difficult to get a table. We would highly recommend this restaurant and hope to return some day
4
We ate here with some friends last night. The outside Sky Bar was ice and a good place to drink whilst watching the sunset and the views. We then went inside to our table. Dishes are served as they are ready and put in the middle of the table to share. Everything we ordered was delicious. For four of us we ordered six starter sizes and five main sizes plus one side dish and a modest bottle of wine. Total was SGD560 . . . Ouch
2
Noise and sound ruin the ambience. At our table near the window all we could hear was the loud bass from the speakers from the balcony bar. The so-called "manager" avoided our many requests we made to the staff to come and talk with us. We simply wanted to recommend turning down the bass speakers which were booming booming and booming from the bar across the restaurant. It was clear the management didn't care about the customer experience and were not interested in what we had to say.The food was not bad, but I will never go back because it is a noisy, unresponsive, unpleasant dining experience
4
Great drinks and food(lunch time). Served by Karen who was very friendly. Pricing wasn't too bad considering the location.
5
The view and the food was amazing. The service was excellent. When visiting Singapore this place is a must do for a special occasion as it is expensive but worth it.
3
4 of us went to Ku De Ta for dinner at 8.30pm last night. We were given a table by the window. We felt very uncomfortable because of the music from the bar outside. Actually we could not hear the music but the loud noise of the bass sound "bong, bong bong, bong...." all the time. They changed a table for us but it was still the same. We gave ourselves time to get used to it but we really couldn't stand it. We complained to the waitress but she could not do anything. We then asked to talk to the manager but she wouldn't come until the 4th time we asked. By now, it started to rain. They then closed the bar and off the music outside. Problem solved. I will never go back there anymore.-14 July 2013

I had dinner with my husband and one of our best friends last night. Since it was Saturday, they had special fireworks in SIN as well as an air show. But that's not the best. We were greeted and attended by TRISTAN, a very special person who makes this restaurant a special one. Food was excellent, Tristan gave us important information about the city and his surroundings. People are any places' first impression, and he made a great one for this restaurant. Thanks Maurice for help as well. Regards from friends from Guatemala
5
Was booked into the restaurant for a 9pm dinner last night but arrived a little early so went to the bar for a drink, definitely not cheap but with a view like it does it's worth every penny.Once seated we were given our menus and really loved the feel of the place with the dimmed lights and candles all around.A friend of mine recommended us to go for the degustation menu, a 5 course meal, and I'm glad he did as my girlfriend and I were amazed and the food that was brought out to us and the presentation given. (Pork belly, black cod, and deserts were are stand out)And a special mention must go out to our waiter Fabio who was really nice and on the ball with everything and definitely added to the whole experience.Overall if your working with a budget this restaurant isn't for you but for everyone else it is highly recommended!

We had a thoroughly enjoyable evening at Ku De Ta. Although the portions were expensive and not large, it was expected for a restaurant at such a location in Singapore. The service was prompt and attentive.We were informed initially that we could only have the table for 2h, but we were allowed to stay as long as we wanted (likely helped by the champagne and wine ordered).We particularly appreciated that they were able to accede to our request to help celebrate a colleague's milestone with a delicious dessert set, it really helped top off the evening.We would certainly come back for small group corporate dinners, for the great relaxed vibe

We dined at Ku de Ta recently, and although the food was pretty good, albeit expensive, the overall experience was so thoroughly unpleasant that I would not recommend it to anyone. We had a reasonably large party with some children and were steered toward a 6pm booking. Wrong - too hot! We arrived early and the outdoor bar area was quiet, however when we tried to have a drink we were not permitted to sit anywhere as apparently the large number of empty tables were reserved for later diners. So we stood around in the heat - couldn't take children to the Bar and we were very unhappy. We were able to take some photos of the harbour, but not permitted on the other side with the pool etc.After waiting impatiently in the heat without a drink, five minutes before the restaurant opened suddenly we were told we could use one of the tables. Too late then to order drinks so it cost them. When we were eventually ushered through to the restaurant I mentioned to someone who thought they were important that it seemed a strange way to treat us - but he was not interested. Spoilt the night

I would say this restaurant on the 57th floor gives an impressive view of Singapore till as far as you can see. On my recent visit to Singapore, I've visited Marina Bay Sand and Ku De Ta. It caters and values exclusivity very much by keeping the SGD $50 cover charge on weekend nights at this swank lounge.They have a no slipper/shorts/tank tops policy from 6 PM on-wards which maintains keeping the riff raff out of it.. something that I definitely appreciate.The drinks are a little over priced but hey what the heck for that kind of view and ambiance I didn't mind shelling out a few extra bucks!!

To be honest, I was worries we will be met with unfriendly staffs for our dinner at Ku De Ta after a few reviews that mentioned such negative service at such a reputable and 'atas' restaurant. But we came to realize our worries were unnecessary. We had a wonderful time there! Our 'guide' Ivo was extremely friendly throughout our dinner and never a point make us feel out of place. Food was definitely worth the price too. We ordered hamachi, crispy squid, roasted black cod, 150D grain fed tenderloin and ended the meal with apply & honey. All dishes are equally good and worth every cents! Yes, I would pay $50+ for the black cod. The view was a plus. We went in at 6pm and manage to catch the sunset after finishing our main course. Would I go back again? Yes! (if budget allows). We would really like to thank Ivo for making our evening at Ku De Ta unforgettable. p.s. total damage for the night ($199 after ++

Crowded noisy atmosphere, expensive drinks, rude staff and unusual hype about the place. have seen far better roof top bars in singapore. Not recommen
5
The service was impeccable from start to finish by Jen and Fabio which complemented the views which succesfully compete with any city skyline. The ambience is entirely comforting and welcoming.
The food was as exciting and delightful as the surroundings.
5
Absolutely the best restaurant experience I have ever had, anywhere around the world. They made us feel like royalty. The food, service, atmosphere and views were amazing and it was cheaper than what I've paid locally, here, in Perth. Highly recommended.

No better choice to observe the sensational Singapore Skyline.
The KuDaTe bar offered a relaxed atmosphere and absolutely amazing views of this unique city.
5
A few friend and I (a party of 6) were there on July 5, 2013, and Fabio was our waiter. The food was very tasty, especially the shiitake mushrooms (we kept ordering more of those) and the black cod. The view was beautiful on a clear night, but most of all, Fabio was a wonderful waiter. He answered all our questions, described all details of all dishes, and was an overall delight (joked with us, took pictures for us). Overall, two thumbs up to Ku De Ta
5
Our friends gifted us an evening in Ku De Ta as a wedding gift. One of the finest views of Singapore.Service is fantastic.We had a seven course meal. Portions are small but each course was a masterpiece. Not just in taste but even in presentation. After our meal, we sat at the bar under the moonlight sipping their delectable cocktails and taking in a breathtaking view of Singapore by night...sigh...By the end of the evening, we were compelled to call our friends and thank them for the best wedding gift we received
5
Spent the night there on 6 July and it was way beyond expectations!! Upon arrival at the restaurant, I felt that the wait staff was not particularly friendly like how the reviews were and I was feeling alittle disappointed at the very beginning. However, this was just the small hiccups of our exceptionally amazing dinner! We have got a spectacular view just enough to celebrate my parents anniversary and was served by the most friendly and attentive staff that I would like to specially give credit to, Zac. He is definitely the key man that made the dinner more pleasant and memorable! In KU DE TA, I believe there's nothing more to ask for! There will definitely be a next visit after this!

This was recommended by a business associate as a secret of saving 20$ each, which one has to pay to visit the top of Marina Bay Sands, for a great view. The 6 of us visited the restaurant with prior booking on a Saturday evening and were really pleasantly surprised with the location of restaurant and the view it offers. With some request and also commitment that we leave by 9pm, we got a good table on the 'garden by the bay' side. You get the real view of the infinity pool from the Kudeta lounge, entry to which is complimentary.Food was good, the semi-cooked tuna and Salmon were good, tempura was amazing. One of the food item smelt of petrol.. Only the servings were small, though not very pricy for the location but very pricy for the servings (249 for 6 people, no alcohol).Visitors should try to arrive earlier and the table should be ready for the first serving at the time of booking but you get the view and time to spend at the bar/ have a view of the infinity pool

We ate here on the last night of our honeymoon and we couldn't have asked for better. It's an experience right from the moment you get in the elevator to ascend the 37 floors to the top of the amazing marina bay sands building. We were a little early and so were signed in and shown to the bar area where the view over singapore is incredible. When our table was ready we were shown to it and initially were seated outside. We didn't really feel that it felt like a restaurant and that it was more like being sat in a very busy bar so we asked to be moved indoors which was done quickly and with minimal fuss. Our waiter inside, Ryan was an absolute gentleman and very charming, knowledgable and funny. The food was world class, as was the wine that we had (red and white). It's right to point out that this is not an inexpensive place but for a special occasion you could not ask for a more special venue. After our dinner we were taken by Ryan into the Club lounge next door, the view in here is even better than the restaurant. We had an absolutely blinding night in the club, finishing up when the sun was coming up! It was a perfect end to an amazing honeymoon, although I expect our heads would disagree with us! Thank you ku de ta and Ryan
5
Was twice now at Ku De Ta and had always a fantastic time! Food is excellent, but the service is even better. The team at Ku De Ta is very attentive and friendly. And the view is breathtaking!! One of the best places if you want to take out your lady!! I will definitely come back
5
Went to Ku De Ta for a night out with some girlfriends and was not disappointed. Apart from the amazing view, the food was delicious, and the service impeccable. A great vibe for a great night out. Will definitely be back. A big thank you to Aneta, who went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and having a good time
5
Everything was great, food and service worth 5 stars. Thank you Simon for being great host, we really had a blast!
4
Even though the beer is $18 where else can you get such a view of Singapore. We walked over and took a peek at the swimming pools as well.
5
Great food and service. Thanks to CHARLENE and CARLY. They are very accommodating. Hope to come back soon!
5
At KU DÃ‰ TA you get excellent food and a perfect atmosphere,but the icing on the cake was the service. We got a waiter named Fabio. He delivered on every aspect, personal and professional. A guy from Italy, Venice that knows his wine and food, at a Singaporean restaurant serving Asian food. Exotic combination. Thank you for a magical night
5
Spent Saturday night at Ku De Ta pampered by Simon and his well trained, impeccable staff. We thoroughly enjoyed the tasting menu with some exquisite wine pairings that brought the flavors alive. Ku De Ta is the one place that I always recommend my friends and family visit when they come to Singapore. Excellent service, good food and great views of Singapore
5
My family and I had to try this roof top fine dining restaurant at the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands. We did not have any reservations, but we were greeted with a lovely smile by the hostess, and the Assistant Manager, Irene Wong. Irene Wong was very friendly and accommodating. She gave a nice table for 6 by the Al Fresco to enjoy the beautiful view of city of Singapore. She recommended the dishes to try, and we were all satisfied. Our server, Shirley gave excellent service. She was very friendly too, and made sure all our drinks orders and food were served on time. Both Manager and server showed us around the roof top despite of the restaurant being busy. They were awesome! The prices of the dishes were kinda a pricey, but it was all worth it. It was really a great experience for all of us. We will surely look forward on coming back to Singapore and come back in Ku De Ta. Keep up the good work
5
I was taken to Ku De Ta Singapore to celebrate my 40th birthday and as expected, the service was top notch. Everything from the personal attention to detail that the servers showed, to offering their opinions about certain dishes and wine pairings and making sure that we were well taken care of made for a very enjoyable evening out. I was impressed as the service staff knew their job very well and made sure that the food was served fast and with a smile on their face as well....a rarity amongst service staff in Singapore. I will certainly recommend others to come and have a wonderful meal with an amazing view and excellent service. Can't wait till my next visit
5
Looking at the building you start to wonder when did they start building horizontal right on the top of the tallest out there. The existence of the Marina Bay sands is awe inspiring. The experience is taken to a new level when you step into Ku De Ta. You need to chose to sit out in the and no matter what time of day it is, the view will blow you away. Talking about the food, it is one of the best you can get in the area, expensive but worth it. The tasting menus are very well though off and deliver the goods with each bite.I would recommend this place to everyone. I enjoyed the ambiance and the entire experience and will definitely go back another time
4
The views are brilliant. Bring your camera. You have to pay extra to go out onto an observation deck (run by different management?). You'd think that what the host of our party was paying it would be included. But we got great views just the same. We were lucky to visit just before the haze ruined all views and photography - though a haze picture might be interesting. A good combination of food I know and like (such as smoked salmon) and the different. Great desserts in small enough portions for you to try several. We all opted for the dearer drinks included option.Our host(ess) who paid for our food thought was a local who thought for that price you could have had better food elsewhere but this place has the skyline view over the city.The real big disappointment was that they could not or would not do anything for the member of our group celebrating a birthday. We had two cupcakes with a candle and a small chocolate slab with the word happy birthday at the Tanglin Club in Singapore for this birthday, and we'd had a small bottle of pink champagne to take home from the Oxo Tower restaurant with a view over London for two birthdays earlier this year
4
The quality of food is definitely very good. The 2 waitresses who waited on our table, Charlene and Carly, were excellent. They were very attentive to our requests and they added positive points to our dining experience. I will most definitely dine here again on my next trip back to Singapore
4
Stunning location, beautiful views. An interesting menu with variety and flavour for all palettes. Let down by inappropriate dining music only.staff were well trained and very pleasant.
4
Great a bar with good music played throughout the day, prices are a little steep but that is generally the same through out Singapore anyway.
5
My wife and I have wined and dined at many a fine restaurant around the world but I have to say that Ku de Ta Singapore is one of the best dining experiences ever. The staff are extremely professional and well trained - their attentive service was impeccable. We ordered the Tasting Plate which is the signature dish which was paired with some fantastic wines. The view from the restaurant is fantastic but almost pales into insignificance against the fabulous food and service - this is what fine dining is all about! A very special thanks to Simon, the manager, and all of the staff for a sensational dining experience
5
The food was very very good, but not perfect, here and there it still possible to improve, the roasted duck was not as crispy and as tasteful as it can be.Sithra provided us with an excellent service! Very polite and very professional. We never had to wait for anything.The music was too loud, therefore business meal is difficult
1
second time at Kudeta Singapore, and it was just bad. nothing to compare with my previous dinner experience couple of month ago!!!i went this time for a supposed quick set lunch. 1h15 min for a set lunch!!!!! food more than average served in a wooden box!! service incompetent and poor standard..... not all your customer are tourists!!! what about the office people? what about the 1 hour lunch break?anyway, this lunch experience as been a big desappointement compare my dinner experience.night and day!!!!! bad lunch surprise for the restaurant at the top of MBS.avoid lunch
4
I went on a Sunday at lunchtime. I took the brunch/lunch formulae, which is all inclusive. Eating is Ã  la carte, dishes are really very good. The view is spectacular but due to thunderstorm, it was not allowed to go outside.It is a nice place to go with the whole family
2
We had pre dinner drinks and the cost for a long island tea did not match what was served!! it was a weak flat coloured drink. A little too pricery for a Stella and a cocktail that cost $52!!!
5
I don't usually review restaurants but this was really and experience. I made the right choice to go to KuDeTa. The observation deck obviously holds more view, I was actually reluctant not knowing which was the best option. The hostess explained in detail what I will get from the choices. Suggested us to go for drinks at the lounge since the next dinner table she has for guest with no reservation is 30mins away. Anyone would think she is actually pushing for business wanting us to use their premises instead of the skypark. The view they had in the lounge was breathtaking, plus the view from the restaurant is as magnificent. A little pricey, but hey we all know good things are never cheap. Service was excellent, despite the fact we didn't have a proper reservation. Thank you to everyone who made my drinking and dining experience an amazing one.And the hostess, without her help, I would have just purchased a skypark ticket instead. Missed her name, but u won't miss her fabulos red hair, stunner
3
Go for drinks at the bar and stop there. Drinks are excellent, the bar vibe is terrific, the views to die for. The restaurant does not live up. The food is fine, don't get me wrong, but it's waaaayyy overpriced and the service is incredibly intrusive. And of course I thought it was related to the absolutely wonderful Ku De Ta in Bali, which I am sure is what was intended, although apparently there is a big lawsuit over the name. I've been to the bar a few times and now to the restaurant just once -- and I won't make that mistake again
5
I don't usually fall for top tourist spots but the pull of going to the top of the Singapore 'surfboard' (or 'skateboard') proved too much. Happily, the food turned out to be as good as the views, as did the cocktails and the atmosphere wasn't stuffy at all, just laid-back and comfy. The four stars instead of five comes only because of circumstance: if it rains then the interior can get a little crowded. Having said that there is always enough room to fit those who have booked. Recommended, as are those view
5
A great restaurant in any respect:- and 200 m above ground - with a breathtaking view, excellent cuisine, extremely friendly service, esp. by Sithra. It was a great expericence to have brunch there. I can warmly recommend it.
4
Great drinks, but the bar cannot keep up with the demand. A good idea to order a bottle? The service including getting in is all designed to remind you a little bit how lucky you are to have been allowed in..
4
This restaurant was wonderful. The food was excellent. The waitress (Daphne) was very helpful in advising on the menu. The location was out of this world. We had such a good evening. The only way it could have been improved was to be at a table on the outside of the restaurant so that you would have access to the wonderful view
5
We stopped by for a few drinks and the bar scene is great in this over the top area on the roof of the Singapore Sands Marina Bay. Expensive drinks but worth it for what you get. Did not try the food as we went well after dinner.
5
Thank you to simon and especially to Patrick who served us this evening. We had a fantastic evening at Ku De Ta tonight - great service, attention to detail and an overall top notch experience - whilst also being really down to earth and good fun.Thanks guys - see you again soon
5
asian cuisine with a contemporary twist (!) recommend to go through all of the starters ...very polite and friendly service in a buzzy and very lively restaurant atmosphere good wine list stunning view over Singapor
5
The best place to unwind after a hectic day is here at Kudeta. Loved the martini cocktails! The food was simply DIVINE! Our server Arlan Valdez was more than hospitable! What a great guy! He suggested the best dishes which exceed our expectations. I can't wait to come back here again on my next business trip.Overall, my friend and i were more than satisfied :-
5
Our last night in Singapore and there could have been no better way to make a final memory than to have dinner at this superb location. Quite apart from the visual feast - it offers unparalleled views of the city from its 57th floor location - the food was incredible. Delicious tapas style morsels created on the principle of top class ingredients prepared simply with an emphasis on flavour.We focused on fish dishes and weren't disappointed with each one more delicious than the last. The tuna was mouthwatering as was the crispy, crunchy spiced squid. The pineapple rice pudding arrived in a flurry of dry ice,adding a real theatrical element to the experience. Ku de ta is more than a restaurant howeve as there's a club lounge with cool music that didn't make even oldies like us feel out of place. Simply superb
4
I think the tittle covers all of what I have to say about this bar.I still had a great time and met some nice ppl there. I'll definitely be back!The best thing to do "if you're staying at the hotel" is to go for a walk by the infinity pool with your girl. you can sit, relax and talk with a nice music in the background! ;
5
I had the pleasure of eating at Ku De Ta on a recent holiday in Singapore. I arrived at the restaurant late in the evening after the dinner service had finished. However, a staff member, Dephenie, asked me to wait and offered to negotiate a late order on my behalf. I was then able to enjoy a delicious meal with the most amazing view over Singapore at night. Despite my late order I was not hurried or harried and the service of Dephenie and her colleagues was tremendous throughout my meal. It was a very pleasurable dinner and evening and a real treat to receive such excellent and professional service. Thank you Dephenie.
5
My favourite restaurant in Singapre. I been there few times when I was in Singapore. Delicous food and fantastic view
4
Head up to this bar for the view but avoid the public washrooms. OMG! Ordered two bottles of champagne and just marvelled.
5
Restaurant with the best environment in Singapore.
The food is good and impressed by the service of Leo who was serving us.
This will be my regular dining outlet.

Ku De Ta or KDT as I like to call it is everything those images on Google promise it to be and more. Let me set the stage or you. Imagine the sun setting over the modern metropolis that is Singapore. You have prime 360 degree seating at THE destination spot in Singapore to watch the night bid farewell to the day. The last vestiges of the sun melting away slowly in the horizon. Next to you, your family or your loved ones are sat. And on the table in front of you, some of the most tongue-stimulating, taste-orgasmic inducing drinks known to man. That's just an average day at KDT at sunset.I was fortunate enough to usher in my mum's ___th birthday at KDT. From the time I entered to the time I left, I have to admit the service was excellent in every way imaginable. In a first world country like Singapore, you would expect service to be on par with the modern comforts and efficient systems that pepper it. Very few places can claim to be on that level. Fortunately, KDT is one o them. MY compliments and kudos to the service team at KDT for making my visit so memorable. I have since been back several times to take in the scenery (and a drink or three).I have no qualms in recommending KDT to my friends who are in town for a visit. If anything, it gives me an excuse to go again

I must have gone to a different restaurant than the people writing most of the reviews. good views if you could get near them . bar was rammed .over zealous and rude security boysother reviewer sounds as if company picking up tab. I saved up minefood bad..surley staff.you only have a 2 hour time limit not prepared to help dietary requirements so your getting what chef cooked.complete waste of money .Had 4 main courses with 3 sides veg and one bottle of wine (4 people)$600.please pay to go up for view and save your money!! you will thank me.as the ratings show there are 250 better places than this one but the management don't see it like thatpaid $1000 to eat in longbar raffles next night and was wow food but no view..Money not the issue poor service and food ar
5
I organized my 40th at Ku De Ta, and I don't think I could have chosen a better venue. Aneta, who is KDT's guest relations manager, organized a fantastic night. I had friends and family down from overseas and they all agreed that not only were the views amazing but the quality of the food & service was unbeatable. A big thanks to Aneta and her team for a memorable 40th. Btw - for those with young kids, don't worry - mine are 5 & 2 years old and the team ensured they were well cared for - both didn't want to leave
3
Probably one of Singapore's top ten best locations to open a restaurant and bar, but sadly it is not done and managed with enough attention and love. Service was mediocre. Inattentive, slow, had to double check twice and so on. Chair covers were stained and had cigarette but holes. I am sure when you have so many customers you need to change it more often. Why do other restaurants and bars manage that better? However, great view and with a glass of wine you may just overlook all that and enjoy a nice sun downer. But you could make much more out of this place
5
Given I am one of the most frequent guests in the restaurant its probably fair I share my thoughts. I come for business and pleasure, with or without family and they very much tailor approach and service to the kind of evening I am looking for.Now this might not be the absolutely best meal you have ever head if you are used to dining in say Lyon, Paris, Brussels, Copenhagen but that said the food is very good here. However thats not what its about. It the entire package. This dining destination is world class when it comes to ambiance, view etc. I have taken more guests than I care to remember and they all, without fail, gawp whne they are sat down, absolutely stunned by the environment, Now serve them great food, wine and cocktails on top of attentive service and it really is unbeatable. And for the friskier types, you can move straight into the lounge to boogie.And oh, by the way, the weekend brunch is truly very good, in the land of brunches the bar is high, but its focused and different than the usual Ritz Carlton brunch spread,and comes with freeflow of not just a great non vintage champagne but also their amazing cocktails.They do take very well care of regulars and provide great flexibility, I could even smoke a cigar outside on New Years eve. Now you might think thats a small gesture but this is Singapore, nobody ever defies whatever ruleset they are subject to.I am trying to find some constructive critisims, its hard, maybe the Dessert card could use some more input from guests. The wine card is over priced but so is the rest of SIngapore. The music could be more jazzy and less electronic. But these are in the minor league. Conclusion remains the same, I will go again and again, and so should you
4
We found our way to the top of Marina Bay Hotel to Ku De Ta around 7.00 and saw the final minutes of a gorgeous sunset and the lights slowly come to life across the city. Fantastic experience, from the 57 floor of this building you are looking down on most of Singapore. The city really tries hard with its lights with many buildings having their own colourful and animated light displays. There was also a laser light display throughout the evening. The cocktails are very tasty and the service was personal and attentive, having a waiter assigned to you for the evening. We didn't stay for dinner, but would have liked to. Nice atmosphere, not too crowded and the crowd turned over regularly once they had seen the view. Nice thing to do
5
We wanted somewhere special for my mothers birthday dinner. Having been to Ku De Ta before we were not disappointed. The food was exceptional with the standouts being the pork belly lollipops and yellow fin tuna. The location and atmosphere are something special with amazing views over Singapore. We were served by Sithra and Marycel who were extremely attentive but not overbearing. All in all a night my mother (and all of us) will long remember. Highly recommended
5
Excellent food and excellent service. Arlan Valdez was our server, and very helpful and attentive. You can't beat the view. Four out of five of us are vegetarian, and the variety and preparation of our food was terrific.
5
What wasnt there to dislike about this experience. The service, food, location all just magnificent.
5
After jostling with tourists who were there more for the view than the dining, my wife and I had started to look for alternatives to take our guests who wanted a nice meal and drinks and yet get a unique Singaporean experience. Simon, the new head of Ku De Ta, is out to prove that this is not a trade off, and we can have it all!In the last couple weeks we ended up going there twice, and Simon and his team took excellent care of us both times. I am vegetarian, and the shitake mushrooms were fantastic, and our guest enjoyed his prawns as well. We have tried two of the dessert sorbets - mango and peach - and it is tough to choose which one was more exquisite.Unfortunately, the location does mean that weather realities take over and limit outside seating time to time. on our most recent trip we had a special business guest, and sure enough - rain and winds meant we were relegated to indoors. Simon and his team more than made up for that dissappointment and ensured we had an exceptional experience.We have returned Ku De Ta to the top of our list

Having seen the Marina Bay in an article in Time Magazine, it was natural to try to visit during a trip to SG. A drink on the terrace to appreciate the sunset, allowed the time to make the reservation of a table for three with a breathtaking view! The manager on duty was attentive to our request, as were the employees. Once settled, the service was discrete, yet particularly efficient. The sommelier guided us very well in our choice of wine, one of the two Malbecs from Argentina, that was a quite good. The food, though not copious, was definitely of excellent quality and variety, from the starters to the fruit plate for desert. Miraculously, though there were threatening flashes of lightening, it did not rain ! Coming from Lyon, one of the worlds gastronomical capitals, I must acknowledge and heartily recommend this unique dining experience
4
We went to Ku De Ta for a birthday dinner. We had booked two months in advance and requested an outside table. This cannot be confirmed on booking due to weather. We were shown to an inside table on our arrival as outside was not open - they would decide later in the evening. The point of this restaurant is the view but we were given a table with a hedge that blocked the view. We laughed and were moved to a slightly better table and requested outside as the rain had stopped. We were told you had to pre book this! After a few negotiations between our very helpful waiter Jin we finally were given an outside table with a great view as the weather had cleared. Jin was also very helpful explaining the menu and suggesting various options. One we were at the outside table our waiter then changed to Leo and equally helpful waiter. The food was variable - I certainly preferred the entrees to the mains - the soft shell crab and Hamachi Sashimi were amazing. We were pleasantly surprised by a complimentary birthday cake . The overall experience was excellent but this was due to the superb table service from both Jin and Leo
5
Do you like your cocktails with a stunning view of the place your visiting. Ku De Ta is the place in Singapore. It is not cheap but then you do a get a drink with your view. And the view is stunning, 360 degrees covering most of the island until it fades away in the shimmering heat. You can pay to see the view without a drink but I have never seen the value of that! Ku De Ta has its own entrance and lift from the mall. Find that, order your drink at the open air bar, sit back and relax. Oh, you can see the hapless souls who paid to get to another view deck. My, that cocktail tasted cool

Brief summary from the dining experience at Ku De Ta: 1. Despite prior reservation was made and requested a table which is away from Skybar (if you would like to have a relatively quiet dining), we needed to keep reminding the crews about our table request. 2. Good view of Singapore city and Marina areas while dining. 3. Food that we had ordered were just average but ‘Pan-seared Tuna Steak’ & ‘Baby Teriyaki Chicken’ are recommended. Shiitake mushroom was good too. 4. Friendly & attentive waitress (Ain & Bonnie) and assistant manager Irene. Went to Ku De Ta restaurant on a weekday-holiday, but had made a table reservation by phone about 2 weeks before the dine-in day and requested an outdoor table which is away from the Skybar, and was told the request will be based on first-come-first serve basis. Upon arriving at Marina Bay Sands Tower 3, we had to ‘pre-register’ aka ‘reservation confirmation’ at the restaurant booth on ground floor (the booth is just opposite to the hotel reception desk) and obtained a ‘restaurant pass’ to access the hotel elevator to 57th floor (Ku De Ta). The restaurant receptionist was politely and friendly assured us that a ‘good’ table had been reserved for us. Up to 57th floor, barely 10 minutes before 6pm (the restaurant operating time starts from 6pm), the restaurant was apparently yet to be ready in welcoming guest. The manager had a briefing to his crew members. We were probably the first (well, no one were in the queue before us) to register for our reservation again at the restaurant front desk. Again, we confirmed our reservation and requested again for an outdoor table which is away from the Skybar. While waiting to be seated in the restaurant, we were sitting at the Skybar. It was a cosy sunny evening and no doubt the view on Singapore city, Garden by the Bay, Flyer, Merlion Park, Fullerton … is superb. It was crowded at the bar though. Unfortunately, we are not allowed to enter the Skypark (a deck which is one level below the restaurant; only hotel guest and ticket holders are allowed to enter) for un-obstructed view of the city.As evening ray sank in, the bar started drawing crowds of guest. It is probably a wise choice not to sit close to the bar due to the noise from crowds and the music, if you would like to enjoy a serene moment with your loved one or family.We were in the second queue for a seating when the restaurant is ready for business. Though we had requested 3 times and despite being the second of the queue, we were led to sit at a table close enough to the bar. Fortunately, the waitress had re-arranged a table upon our request again, a table which is about 10m away from the bar. The food serving is based on sharing concept, which basically means all food to be shared on the table. We had ordered : Shiitake Mushroom, Smoked Salmon, Black Tiger Prawn Salad, Pan-seared Tuna Steak and Baby Teriyaki Chicken with desserts Apple & Honey and Mango Lime Pudding. We are not the food commemorator but the Pan-seared Tuna Steak & Baby Terriyaki Chicken is our recommendations. The tuna steak was prepared nicely cook (circa 50-60% cook) and great serving with avocado paste, while the teriyaki chicken was tender and juicy. The popular Apple & Honey was over-shadowed by the Mango Lime Pudding, probably good to have something sour-sweet after a heavy meal. We were served politely and attentively by two young and lovely waitress – Ain & Bonnie – cheerful and friendly with good recommendations on food choice. Oh ya, not forget to mention Irene too, an assistant manager who is friendly to mingle with

When I read critics about KU Dè TA Restaurant on top of Marina Bay Sands, I was very confused. I was in charge to book an amazing spot for a photography crew of 10 people and saw that some people rated the food in the restaurant not so good, but others did rate it excellent. Anyway, I trusted the good comments and we were rewarded in the most amazing way. Food was creative and absolutely excellent, we could have not wished for more. Views from the Marina Bay Sands are magnificent and we had one oft our best dinners ever. We are traveling the world, always in search for the good place and every single person of our team was amazed from starter, over main and wine to dessert. It was that good, that we booked for a second night straight away.After dinner we moved to KU Dè TA - Club Lounge. Of course the views were beautiful again, drinks and music were nice. The difference to the restaurant was the staff. They were arrogant and unfriendly and when it was closing time at 2am they took our drinks out of our hands!!! This is unacceptable and made our great experience less good. Because of that our rating for service goes from 5 to one point

Probably the only place where you can see so close the amazing rooftop pool of Marina Bay Hotel.. Ku De Ta is a cool place for a drink or to eat something.. sofas, lounge music, some table and the best view ever in town where you can see both the bay and all the towers, downtown, gardens by the bay etc..It's expensive if you go at night and take a table, but if you want just have a look to the pool and the landascapes, go there at sunset and grab a beer... you will enjoy the place without spending a fortune...I suggest it as one of the most amazing place in town..

My wife and I ate at this restaurant. It sits at one end of theSkypark on top of Marina Bay Sands and overlooks the skyline of Singapore. The atmosphere was excellent, subdued lighting which made the outside view stand out all the more. The staff were very attentive and the quality and taste of the food was excellent. We liked that all the meals are placed in the centre of the table and are meant to be shared. It could be seen as expensive but good food and service often is. The only negative was the cost of the wine which was 2 or 3 times what we would pay at home but that may, or may not be, because of tax on the wine, I don't really know. When we had finished we went out on the Skypark deck and had an all around view of the city and harbour and watched the nightly light show in Marina Bay and at the Gardens
5
I was told to go to tower three and go up there to Kadeta. Then y don't have to pay 20:00 for the view. Which would be worth it alone.
5
The bar offers fantastic views of the city, as well as the pool. The only better thing is to actually go swim in the infinity pool, but that requires you to actually stay at the hotel.

Ku De Ta has amazing food and it's delicious, but not a place for those wanting to save on some dollars.

A fab last-bar crawl destination on a weekend night. Mind the dress code, they are quite strict (no sleeveless/sandals/flip-flops for the men--at least smart casual) Love the ambience,hiphop music makes the party alive til 3AM (or beyond!) and the best open rooftop to boot!
5
Had a fantastic dinning experience at Ku De Ta, you must get there for pre-dinner drinks at the bar outside first, we had a great table outside overlooking Singapore, modern asian fusion was very good especially soft shell crab and pork tenderloin, albeit you need to judge how much you order, excellent and friendly service and as we were there as a family they were very accommodating with the kids and all in all in the most stunning location. A must do as a special treat when in Singapore

Amazing views (outside). We fell in love with this place. Singapur is amazing but this place wins it, great staff and great food. In case you do not get to seat outside you will not enjoy it! It's quite pricy but what the heck! You only get To live once!!!

Not paid to get into a bar for a long time...(over 45 sing $ per person, although it included a drink) and while the view is stunning on top of the Marina Bay Sands, there doesn't seem to be a policy of numbers...so it gets totally overpacked. Nowhere to stand comfortably, let alone put your drink...Service average. Won't go back
5
The view is breath taking, although you need to pay to get in the view areas it is just a good if you go the bar. Customer service was amazing and were always at your every need. Food was amazing and desert was to die for. I recommend the Tenderloin or the Cod. Wonderful experience and exquisite atmosphere

Pros - Spectacular view. And thats about it.Terrible food and selection, rude and haughty waitresses, miniature portions, way overpriced. What prompts people like me to write a survey is the anger that comes from absolute appalling restaurant service coupled with a high bill. The chicken teriyaki was overdone, the Nori rice was mushy and tasteless, and the white chocolate dessert looked like something out of a molecular cuisine rip off idea. All in all, like other one star reviewers have said, only go for the view and nothing else.I have a theory as to why the food is so bad. Most of the dinner crowd on top were tourists and hotel guests. Owing to this free flowing and replenishable captive audience that will anyway want to go and see Ku De Ta for the view, the restaurant has an incentive to serve substandard non-filling food. This is because their incentive is a high table turnover both in terms of price and rotations - what better way to do that than serve small portions which are overpriced and substandard in quality? We left quickly, within an hour and a half,and sure enough as we were exiting the table was again filled.Pathetic overpriced food and service
5
OK, so it's a little pricey - especially after our Vietnam trip... But wow, what amazing food. Naturally the view was incredible too! Service very good and a well kept wine list. If you've got some $ to spare - worth a visit!
5
Great location, courteous & friendly staff. The staff guides you on what to order as we had a pure vegetarian in our midst.
Food was scrumptious, great service. Great choice of drinks.
View of Singaporebfrom the top is awesome.
Very good restaurant worth a vist.

Ku De Ta is a great place for a first dinner in Singapore. What magnificent view of the Singapore nighttime skyline. The food was okay in my opinion, but then very few rooftop restaurants anywhere in the world have food as their "high-light."Our group of 27 people reserved three long tables and was seated promptly upon arrival. The food came quickly thereafter. I think the emphasis was on Asian fusion, with stuff like sushi and tempura presented in a most unusual but delicious fashion. Each dish's portion was quite large and most of them hit the spot, but after a few of them they seem to taste oddly similar. What was lacking was the usual spicy kick associated with some of the same things you have outside Ku De Ta.Service was good but rushed, which, to me, was understandable as the place looks to be jam-packed every minute of the evening. There were throngs of people who went up just for the view, which you had to pay extra for if you are eating at the restaurant. I tried my best to get some photos of the skyline but it was difficult with all the people around. I did see some nice angles, though, and the beautiful people dressed to kill around you made the place look classy and sophisticated.Ku De Ta is good as an occasion restaurant and an above-average experience as an introduction to the Singapore night scene

For all who like modern Japanese Cuisine this spot is the place to go. I had one of the best tempura prawn ever, very thin coating and a delightful curry sauce on top.Another must try are the tempura squid....you wont forget them.Fantastic food and an amazing view. Bye Arnol
4
We didn't eat here, but had some drinks at the bar. The view is breathtaking, but it is really expensive and the service was really poor verging on rude. Would recommend going for the view, but not worth staying for more than one drink (we actually went to see the laser show, but it was pretty rubbish, so don't make a special effort to go here for that). It is quite dressy - not sure if they have a specific dress code, but the girls were all in dresses and heels

On our trip to Singapore and Indonesia, we decided we couldn't miss dining at the Marina Bay Sands and we weren't disappointed. The vibe at KU DE TA is cool, city-chic without being pretentious. The staff were very friendly (like everyone we came across in this city) and attentive, and were knowledgeable about the menus. I can highly recommend the crispy-sticky baby squid, 'brandt beef' ribeye and shiitake mushrooms. Delicious.No, it's not cheap, but you have to take into consideration the amazing view, the high quality of food and its presentation, and the fabulous staff. Depending on the time of year, book a table outside and away from the bar area. Our table was right near the busy bar and a huge speaker. Although the DJ turned down the speaker without being asked (impressive), we had random women sit at our table to rest their weary, high-heeled feet without asking. Each time, the bouncer came over and politely moved them on, apologising to us profusely for the inconvenience. It wasn't particularly an issue for us, but it would have been nice if these people had asked to sit down.My only gripe with KU DE TA is that we had to wait half an hour beyond our reservation time after I'd received numerous emails and phone calls to confirm I was still going. We were directed next door to the Club Lounge which, again, offered fantastic views and expensive drinks. The place smelled like it was ready for a deep-clean and I half expected my shoes to start sticking to the floor. If you're already a little tipsy and there to splash-the-cash and party, then I'm sure it's a great night out. It's just a shame the standard in the restaurant does not carry over to the club

I had gone there for dinner with a friend who was staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. As we did not have reservations, we were told there was a minimum hour’s wait for a table. We wanted to check out the bar so decided to wait for the table after giving our contact number to be contacted at when a table was ready.The bar is located outdoors and overlooks the viewing deck of Marina Bay Sands. The view is amazing through its not the best for photographs as the viewing deck can be a hindrance. The bar menu was very innovative with none of the traditional cocktails. I had the “Angry Bird” which was delicious and surprisingly priced at $20. Good value for money! The downside of the bar area is the lack of surfaces to hold your drinks, and the narrow standing area. After waiting for around an hour and not receiving any call about an available table, we went to the reservation desk to enquire. Frustratingly they had a table ready but had not bothered to call us! Anyways we were given a choice of indoor or outdoor sitting, and chose to sit outdoors to enjoy the view. I was slightly apprehensive about the warm weather but there were fans that kept the area nice and breezy. The food menu is a fusion of Asian dishes with an emphasis on Japanese cuisine. The food is meant to be tapas style with 3-4 dishes sufficient for 2 people. The food arrived quickly and was really yummy! My favourites were the king prawn tempura and the tempura yasai roll. Our waiter recommended us to order 5 dishes, 2 small dishes and 3 main sharing dishes. However this was too much for 2 people. As expected the food is costly and we ended up paying $90 per person for our dinner; we had water with our meal. Make sure you have a reservation, if not be prepared to wait for at least an hour for a table

We took some clients to dinner at Ku De Ta and had a fairly private outdoor table right on the edge of the restaurant within the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. The atmosphere and views were spectacular. We had dinner which was similar to tapas covering a variety of vegetable, fish and meat selections. The service was top-notch and pretty much every food item was great. Guests particularly liked a barbecued salmon dish. The only item I felt was average was a scallop entree. All this great stuff comes at a price - a very high one. If you do drinks, wine, dinner, dessert you can build up quite an expensive tab with little effort
5
Other than the music that began at 9.30pm and not allowed to go out on the viewing deck beside the restaurant, Everything was amazing. The music became loud and took away the beauty of what was at the time, which was a shame however there is a view. an amazing awesome view and really i do feel if one eats at the restaurant they should be able to go on deck as well. But, don't let that put you off, it is worth every cent going and eating here at KU DE TA Restaurant in Singapore. It maybe expensive to some, so save and go....... And, of course one cannot fault the view or FOOD.... BEYOND YUM!!! Paid $158.00 each for our MANY dishes and have not one complaint. other meals are around the $40 mark, some a little cheaper. Our waiter ARLAN VALDEZ was fabulous, aware of everything that was going on, he was polite, fast and happy. Very Good, he was very professional. Fabulous Arlan. And, Thank you. P.S rated atmosphere lower due to the music that was played loud and in the ear!!! We left soon after has it took a night club feel on. shame we would of stayed longer. Still, we will recommend eating here. I hope your experience will be just as great as ours

i went there for a nice a dinner with my wife; however, the only thing nice about our dinner was the view which absolutely amazing. Nevertheless, the moment they brought us the food we were completely disappointed. for the amount of money they charge, i was expecting high quality dishes but instead we got a plain fried rice and a flavorless tuna steak. I would not recommend this place if you want to eat so you and if you want the view you are better off just paying the cover for the rooftop because the price of the restaurant is way too high

Fantastic views of Singapore by night and staff very pleasant. Food is nothing special and there are better places to eat.Very noisy inside.

My daughter & I had Sunday brunch - quite expensive but you could make a pig of yourself if you really wanted to. There was fruit, meats, cheese, bread, eggs plus accompaniments, noodles, salads, and a huge array of cakes. A wonderful experience and the views from the 57th floor were amazing. We were there for about 2 1/2 hours - our brunch cost approx. $85AUD per head and did not include alcohol but it is worth it for the experience.
5
I went there for a drink with three of my friends and the bartender name izhar was really a sweet young man. he took good care of us at the bar and make us feel special. he over heard my friend sing a birthday song to me and he came just to wish me a happy birthday. thank you izhar for making it a special day on my birthday yesterday

Dark hotel, over priced food though quality wise it was acceptable. Only saving grace are the staff who are friendly and knowledgeable. This was an experience I would not repeat. The one thing that the restaurant should be famous for is the view, however, we were seated in a location that did not provide any view, when we had finished the meal the bar area was packed and there was no access to any space for even a 5 minute look-see, when I asked the restaurant staff if we could visit the viewing deck I was advised that we had to purchase a viewing ticket despite having spent $800 in the restaurant. All in all a rip-off of the highest order
5
This restaurant is located on the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, three of us visited this restaurant and all had the tasting menu, really fantastic food, well prepared and presented it all looked and tasted delicious. We had a table in the covered part of the restaurant, really incredible views from up here, 57th floor i think it was. There were better tables closer the he side of the building but we actually prefered where we were as it was less hectic. Lots of choice on the menu apart from the tasting menu, great place
5
On a short trip to Singapore we went to Ku De Ta twice, once for lunch and then for dinner, as the food was great and we wanted to see the view during the day and at night. On both occasions the food was excellent. The menu is not massive and it is very asian/japanese inspired modern cuisine, to get the most out of the menu share the meals which are of a small to moderate size. The Teriyaki Chicken was to die for as were the Stuffed Chicken Wings, and the Pork Belly Lollipops, yes lollipops, melt in your mouth. Great wine list as well. The staff in the restaurant and bar are magnificent and couldn't do enough to make the night special. The security however for the Marina Bay Sands, as the restaurant is above an observation deck, are a bit zealous and unpleasant in a polite but officious way, but not Ku De Ta's fault, they couldn't do more to make a great event. The view is an experience on its own and shouldn't be missed
5
Just wondering if this restaurant have same management with the one in Bali, because i love it too.. This place served great food, with good quality, the service is great. View is amazing. Ladies night on Wednesday also amazing.. Love being here.. So recommend this place if you come to Singapore.. Little bit expensive, but worth to spend.. :
5
This place is fantastic for two reasons. The location is top of class, as t offers a full view of Singapore skyline. Secondly, the dishes are innovative and interesting. The price level is not low, but not as high as I expected taking the setting into consideration

My boyfriend and I went to Ku De Ta with apprehension, after reading some bad reviews on a few websites. Nevertheless we decided to just give their weekend brunch a try. We were surprised and left impressed.We were received by a waitress named Michelle. She explained to us how the ala carte buffet works and recommended some dishes to us. She also advised us to savour the food and ordered slowly as the portions are big. She further advised that we ordered the hot dishes first before we proceeded to the buffet table to take the appetizers or desserts, as the hot dishes will take a bit of time to reach the table. I then asked for her name and started to call her by her name thereon. During our dining period, she was dedicated and attentive to our dining needs. When she saw me stood up looking around, she hastily came to me to offer help if needed (I was looking for the washroom by the way). When Michelle was going away for her break, she came to our table to inform us and told us that her colleague, Arlan will take care of us meanwhile. Similarly, Arlan was attentive and dedicated. I also would like to mention an Indian waiter's initiative. My boyfriend dropped his napkin and didn't realise it. This Indian waiter approached my boyfriend with a new napkin in his hand and placed it on my boyfriend's lap. The staff, especially some, were alert, initiative and dedicated. We were impressed.The food were hits and misses. However, the overall dining experience was excellent. A Customer Service Manager by the name of Maurice chatted with us a little when we expressed our thanks. She then brought us outside to take a look at the view from the top and took some photos for us. We will definitely return and will look for the team of Maurice, Michelle and Arlan. Kudos and well done Ku De Ta!P.S. Just in case you're wondering, both my boyfriend and I are Asians and no, I'm not disabled (that could have warranted that extra attention) :)I will absolutely recommend this place to my friends.Amelia A

If your easily impressed and are unfamiliar with good service I might imagine you would quiet like "Ku De Ta". The atmosphere was stale and boring yet somehow overcrowded. If not for the partial, obstructed view of Singapore I doubt anyone would visit this restaurant given the level of hospitality and competition that you can experience in other parts of the city.Expect arrogant, unhelpful management staff and security, friendly but wildly inexperienced wait staff and high menu prices. I don't however want to discount the quality of the food being served, my girlfriend and I had the American Steak($50) tender, delicious and becoming of its high price tag. However bottled still water ($12), side dishes (12-$16) and beer ($16) are ridiculous not because of their price point but because in general the view is just not that great (especially considering other rooftop bar/restaurants particularly those in the CBD offer much better city views, better restaurant service and a more reasonable price point for menu items holistically.)While the venue promises a great view of the city there are only 4 tables of which you can actually enjoy the view of beautiful Singapore and even so those tables have an obstructed view because of inappropriately placed fake plants. $50 just to get through to the bar after 9pm, not worth the money if your just after a drink.Liked best food, liked least staff. Waste of time, wont go back

We went there for dinner, which we had booked. Went early and found the restaurant crowded with people having drinks. We were shown to our table outside over looking the Gardens by the Bay - fabulous view. Our waitress, PJ was very friendly and helpful and once we chose our food and drink everything arrived in order. The food is delicious, fresh and beautifully presented. The evening was a wonderful experience - credit to Irene on overseeing the whole resturant and making us feel special. Only one comment about the music, could be more lounge chill music rather than beat box.Yes its expensive, but it's something that you have to do when you visit Singapor
5
It was an impromptu event to visit ku De Ta and a decision that we've never regret! It was too early to party at a club a few days back and a weekday with not much of a great night to be at so we've decided to give their restaurant a try. We were convinced by a trainee door host to try their unique modern Asian Cuisine. A "loving" tapas concept as she described. So loving it was, we enjoyed her recommendation of the hamachi sashimi. We were assigned an outdoor table just right in the middle facing the bar. Even though we couldn't see the view, but we had much fun walking ard the bar to take snap shots of the magnificent city. Enjoyable it was. Expensive; yes it is. But the service, good "loving" food and the view complements it all! We'll definitely be back.

Awesome but getting in and out of the restaurant requires you to dodge the tourists in the foyer. It's a complicated process. The views are spectacular and the meals match the view.It is however expensive. S$8 for a Diet Coke and S$20 for a Beer is a lit ridiculous. It put a dampener on the night
5
My friend and I arrived without a reservation but were lucky enough to be seated for dinner. The food was amazing. Unfortunately, it was overcast and rainy so the views were not so great, but the food and service made up for it. We were blown away by the delicious sticky crispy baby squid and the lamb. I also tried the damsel in distress martini and it was so good, even for a non-gin drinker like me. I would go back here in a heart beat. I saw that they are opening another location in Bangkok, so I hope there is more to come in the future.

I took two friends who were on a stopover to Ku De Ta. The view from the restaurant is impressive. I suggest sitting inside and on the higher level if you can, as its actually cooler and somewhat quieter (though the music is very loud). Or you can sit on the deck but it will be hot and noisier. Service is well-meaning but a little rough around the edges - I get the impression staff turnover is high. Its not cheap, so take the set lunch options if you're planning on doing some shopping later. The food was good but for the price not outstanding. They do offer comp parking for a spend of SGD150 or more, just as well since MBS is expensive - but even for the price, you can't walk from the restaurant door to the outer deck (a difference of two metres) without paying extra. Its a cliche worldwide that restaurants with a view often lack in the food department; having been once for the view, I wouldn't return for the food

We've been twice. The first time for lunch in late November with friends who were in Singapore on a cruise layover. Expensive but delicious, interesting food, good service, lovely experience. And the views are spectacular. Adding to the experience was that access to the observation deck was included with our meal. It was therefore a great disappointment to return in February, again with visiting friends, for Sunday brunch, expecting a similar enjoyable time. Food was fine, not interesting or exceptional in any way and extremely overpriced. But far worse was the appallingly inattentive service, beginning with our drink order arriving one by one over a twenty minute span and continuing with the long awaited and then staggered arrival of our entrees. Once the entrees arrived, we were largely unable to get the attention of any servers. We had to stand to get our bill. We then discovered that having spent $650 on brunch, we would have to pay a further $80 to take our guests down to the observation deck. Tacky. Adding to our disappointment was that having brought the service issue to the attention of management via the comments card included with our bill, we have yet to have a response. For those who want to sit outdoors, beware the blaring music

Thank you Faizal for coming to say hi and add some entertaining conversation to our cosy supper. Ivo - superb service, easy to relate to and your ease and comfort level with guests is admirable. Food was wonderful except the kailan which was like straw. Desserts to die for - wasabi icecream looked and tasted gorgeous. Same for the mango lime concoction. Super foie gras, miso soup and salmon sashimi. Fabulous bellinis as ever. Thank you for the surprise pineapple soup and coconut as our anniversary surprise gesture - so thoughtful and fun yet tastefully done.Unfortunately our Chinese waitress at first couldn't answer our questions on menu items and when she spoke she evidently had overlooked key personal hygiene. Very unpleasant.That aside it was all good.Will be back for the next event :

Another prime example of a 2 star offering at 5 star prices. Ku De Ta charges exhorbitant prices for very low quality food and drinks and barely passable service. I can understand coming here if you must go to the top of Marina Bay Sands to check out the view, but better keep your expectations low

I'll start off by saying that I wasn't paying so I have no idea if this was good value or not. I can certainly confirm that is one of the world's more spectacular views so if it was following McLaughlan's rule that the food is inversely proportional to the view the food would have been rubbish but it wasn't.Started with a g&t at the bar then dinner. Menu was designed around sharing, food was as asian fusion, dishes like Californian rol with white crab, tuna sashimi, salt and pepper squid were good, larger dishes like braised Iberico pork cheeks, black cod were excellent. Rice was a bit ordinary. Desserts weren't very successful - all 4 were pretty forgettable.Didn't see the wine list but had a Cornas which was pretty tasty

It's a bar...on a boat ...that is perched on top of 3 skyscrapers ....overlooking Singapore...
Stop kidding yourself ..
Of course you have to do it !

Hi! My fiance, mother-in-law and immediate family had a fine-dining dinner (before our ROM the next day) at this restaurant. I was very impressed with the place. It overlooked the whole of Singapore. It was even prettier at night. Amazing view. Service was very efficient. Our server, Ms. Michelle Marie, was very helpful and entertained us very well. She took time to explain what was on our plates. Food was served promptly and it was delicious! It was a fusion of Western and Asian cuisine. We will surely come back

Hi came down to Singapore for a Business trip.Was at Kudeta on a Wednesday night... Great view..Waited quiet long for our turn to order drinks... Than we were approached by Fredrick.. He was accommodating ...even-tough it was so busy he took time to explain to us about the cocktails with a great smile. A funny guy. Awesome cocktails, and wonderful service..enjoyed he's mojito .It was refreshing ....It would be great if there is few seating for us guest at the bar to chill n enjoy the view..my feet hurts...was very reluctant to leave...it would b perfect if we could sit n enjoy the view..Great view...great cocktail and not forgetting our bartender Mr.Fredrick thanks for your servic

Amazing views and its one of the best sky bar i've been. I was aproach by a server name idzar, he was a nice and funny guy. We had a short conversation and He offered to take a picture for me. The drink that was recomanded from him is tony stark pepper is really good. Surely to visit again

Recently had brunch at Ku De Ta and it's something I would recommend. The variety and quality of the food is excellent and free flow of all types of coffees, teas and juices was included. Comes with a price tag, but the stunning view combined with the very good service and the food/drinks were worth it.If you want to have a good view, make sure to choose an outside table (except if you cannot do without airconditioning)
4
The service was superb but a bit pricey. So if you're on the a tight budget don't go venturing here. BUT, for all its pricey menu, you're getting your money's worth in terms of service, taste, presentation and ambience -- albeit too many tourists during my experience.To view Singapore via the deck, you have to eat at this place. You can do reservations at the concierge located at the ground floor of Marina Bay Sands near the reflecting pool of the mal

we booked this for our last blast in Singapore, hoping to enjoy fantastic food with a great view. The problem is that is is a concept geared toward younger people, but with older people prices!we got there 1 hour early to enjoy cocktails in their 'Lounge Bar' which was packed as it is the best place for a view without being a hotel guest or paying to go to the observation platform - 100 Singapore dollars for 4 drinks!the indoor area is a bar with dance floor and some seating, but the music was so loud that outside is where everyone goes. the sofas are all facing inward, weird.we went through to dinner, to be told we had the best table in the restaurant which did seem right, but were immediately disappointed to see that the restaurant is set quite a way back, and views limited. food was tapas style fusion Asian, for sharing, mediocre to average at best. staff were excellent, wine list comprehensive, but expensive.Dinner for 4, with wine, over SGD 700, and we did not each much.the biggest problem, and be warned, they have carried the 'concept' into the restaurant and the loud music from the lounge bar is constantly playing in the restaurant! not very nice to have heavy bass continuously when having a nice meal with friends or family. the age of the diners must have been 40 and over.We went back to the bar after the meal to have a drink and enjoy the view by night, but half of the bar had been roped off for 'premium' drinkers - guess what, it was all empty, music louder and people crammed into the small space left outside - no one on the dance floor

Early evening view was spoilt by the weather, but the nighttime skyline was fantastic. Nice cocktails (Tony Stark's Pepper if you like a sweeter Martini). The service was good, not great and likewise the food. Very nice experience and worth it for the view, but for food there are better restaurants for less money

My colleague and I were to be in Singapore on business and it happened to be my colleagues birthday so I booked a table a few weeks prior to the arrival date. I had asked for an outdoor table and expected to be placed between many other tables near the bar, but to our surprise we were taken to a secluded area with private dinner tables and an amazing view of the Gardens by the Bay as well as the Singapore Flier! We had a very pleasant meal and they brought out a special cake for my colleagues birthday. It was the best service I have had and they really made sure we had a fabulous time
5
Staff service is excellent and prompt without being invasive. We chose the taster/sampler menu for four people. If I'm remembering right this was SD158 per person. The lamb and beef were butter smooth, but all of the other dishes were well presented and delicious. Favourite cocktail was Lady of the night - really nice
4
We went to the weekend brunch and it was more about being on the 57th floor than the food but worth the $100.00 pp without alcohol..The staff are very attentive and helpful and something you would only the once.
5
Was really delicious Litchi Martini and the best service ever! The all who really want to get good cocktail experience, relaxing mood and beautiful panoram.
4
The place hass a good view of Singapore's skyline. Food wise, expensive and not impressive. taste good but not value for money. Pretty crowded. Do make reservation if you don't want to be turned away.

Wow! On top of the world; I secured us a booking for Saturday lunch well in advance of our trip and was very happy we did; such a wonderful place to be up high in the sky. The food was good but probably not the highlight of the experience. Expensive yes; but if you enjoy a champers or wine then Singapore will be! Great ambience attentive staff; enjoy

I was there in early of march 2013. I think this one of the best bar in the sky. They made a good cocktail and also well food. But the services they has, some good and the rest was bad. Very strict and no compromise, even you're a guest in the hotel. I was wearing short pants but still in the nice way. And one of the manager or something talk to us. She said that after 6.00 in e evening, guest didn't allowed to wearing that kind of clothes. But no one mentioned to us, not the waiter and security as well. She give me 5 minutes to finishing my meal. I just don't like the way she talk, so rough and didn't show any polite. I live in Bali and oftenly went to ku de ta. Their services was incredible.In general, this place was stunning with beautiful view. Even the F & B quite expensive but still worth it. Only the service need more upgrade from strick to be more polite. As people say Guest is the king
5
I went there for a drink with a friend and the view was awesome.the cocktail was pricey but it was good. It was recomended by one of the friendly staff name izhar. He did a very good job on the service and giving us a hint on a good place to go for shopping and photo taking. Will definately be here again. :
5
I went alone during a business trip. Great for lunch, didn't have a problem with reservations. I assume dinner would be different. Menu was a fusion menu and they catered to my gluten-free diet very well. A lot of fresh fish/japanese inspired menu.Great views and cocktails on the outer balcony during sunset is divine!try their wasabi ice cream :
2
What a disappointment!!! The place is amazing and the view terrific. HOWEVER the service is totally lousy. When we wanted to order the sides, they said they ran out, so we picked something else, ran out also, something else? Again, ran out... In the end, we were left with a choice of 2 available sides out of 12 mentioned on the menu! Not to mention that these were exactely the 2 we didnt want (plain rice and sweet potatos, wow)... Great view - but such a disappointment on the service that we wont go back for dinner. Go for a drinks, that is great, but avoid the restaurant
4
We had 12 hours to discover Singapore and top of the list was a visit to the KU DE TA for lunch and a cheeky cocktail.The staff were superfriendly and we had a few cocktails and some oysters. Its is a perfect photo opportunity and a must for a day visit to singapor
4
So why pay the $20 to take the elevator to the viewing platform on the 57th floor of this amazing landmark when you can pay $25 for a beer and enjoy the spectacular night view.
5
Secured a lunch birth without reservation - but book ahead if you can.. Inside restaurant, with seating for two. Took the fixed lunch menu, and opted for the Belly Pork as the main. It was outstanding? My colleague ate the salmon option and drooled throughout. Either menu option was excellent. We asked for the sommelier to recommend a wine to accompany the meal. We opted for a Margaret River Tate Chardonnay. It was superb, and at 90 SGD was, in my opinion excellent value. The service was attentive throughout and we were very well looked after. The views out, across the bay were magnificent. After lunch we took drinks on the veranda. Thoroughly enjoyed the spicy (chilli) plum wine. A taste not easily forgotten. The price is on the high side, but there are few locations in the world with such a superb vista, accompanied by good food and service. Highly recommended. Definitely a place to visit in Singapore. I hope to revisit in due course
4
Located on top of the Marina Bay Sands Towers, the Ku Dé Ta provides a breathtaking view over Singapore.Reservation needed. A reservation does not automatically imply a table with a view.Food is good and expensive. Likewise beverages. But coming to Singapore on a vacation and not going to Ku Dè Ta is not an option!!
4
Great ambiance, fabulous place and good food. We met up with a good friend of mine working here in Singapore, when we came almost all the tables were occupied and we have to settle ourselves on a cocktail table. We ordered foods off the menu with "fancy names" and had a couple of drinks. The view was awesome and the waiting staff were very friendly and accommodating. Price? Well, we're paying for the view and ambiance. I recommend making a reservation if your planning to go here and they have a dress code "smart casual". We'll definitely come back whenever we will be in Singapore
5
Our visit with our Singaporean family friends was one of the highlights of our trip. The company probably iced the cake but overall the quality of the food and standard of service were amongst the best we have encountered. Get there as daylight disappears and enjoy some of the best views of the bay area.Not cheap but in this case you only get what you pay for
3
Treated ourselves to the 'tasting menu' which consisted of 12 dishes with fancy names. We were quite excited to see what the restaurant can deliver since it is categorized as 'fine dining' under Marina Bay Sands' website. The presentation of the foods were quite good, but none of the dishes were truly impressive or memorable for that matter. The staff were a bit aloof and seemed to be enjoying the relaxing ambience a little too much. The view and atmosphere at the bar were good though, arguably compatible to the view you get from the ferris wheel (if you are a tourist and thinking about going to the ferris wheel). In the evening, it is really a nice place for romantic evening out or cocktail night with friends
4
The view was nice, but I didn't much appreciate it because we went in the evening. We actually planning to have some dinner for my bday celebration but unfortunately it was fully booked. So I advice everyone that if you're planning for dinner, you have to book first to guarantee a seat inside. But anyway, the bar is still open for drinks rain or not. The bartender was good but I guess he has forgotten our drinks coz it took quite long before he did it. Very crowded, we got a table just next to the over view, the glasses are all on the table left by the guests before us, but nobody has cared to clear those(not sure if self service or not) overall was not so fascinating then. Just a normal busy bar/restaurant, in addition only was the city over view.
3
Lunch for four - £200, 2 starters, 4 mains, 2 beers, one bottle wine, one water. Food ok, good size portions so no complaints there, and service very good. Try and get a table with a view, as some of them are tucked in corners with no Air Con and it can be a little stifling. Overall, worth a visit, just be aware it won't be cheap! Try out the Club Bar too, with fabulous views across Singapore and the hotel's Infinity Pool
5
I'm a total foodie and was hoping that this place was not just a hotel restaurant with a view but a place with great food. I was not disappointed on either front.The food is expensive in comparison to the other food we ate at food courts etc which can be great - but in my view was well worth it. We were going to have the tasting menu but chose to pick a variety of dishes ourselves for a similar price. Highlights were the foie-gras and scallop sushi (best sushi I've ever had - a great combo) as well as great beef dishes, slow cooked duck breast and amazing tempura tiger prawns in yellow curry. Wine was expensive - $99 for an average Sauvignon. Had cocktails before but they were quite average and not very alcoholic!Service was impeccable. I explained it was my friends bday when booking and we were given an amazing table outside with great view. Waiter was attentive throughout and could not have been friendly or more on the ball. They even brought out a birthday cake at the end. Nice music played in background too.If you can eat cheap for a few nights at a food court then treat yourself to this amazing Asian-European fusion food. And ask for a table outside!!
5
Wear your most awesome shoes & sexy top to this sky high eatery. Drinks yummy, food good enough, ambiance, buzz and opportunities to "strike a pose" abound. This experience on the 57th floor is transcendental. Leave your earthbound standards behind. This is something fun, new & delicious!
1
Went there during X-mas. Limited, un-creative and mediocre selections of food. The drinks appear to be better. Will not go back.
3
Nothing to rave about except that if you happen to go way up there, the view is fabulous! The prices at Ku De Ta is on the high side though.
3
The Marina Bay Sands is a beautiful hotel capped by Ku De Ta (Singapore's answer to the Sky Bar). The view is amazing and the location gives you an overall impression of the bustling metropolis which is Singapore. The drinks and food are very expensive commensurate with the location. The dishes are Asian fusion and extremely unimpressive and mediocre. My soft shell crab was anything but soft! The staff are all very friendly and very efficient and besides the view, they make the restaurant and bar. The alfresco area is very pretty and it is worth asking for a table outside if you are going to dine there. My advice is to either just go there for an expensive drink or just take the lift up to the public area and enjoy the view for free
2
We ordered two main dishes, one veggie side dish and one dessert to share between two people. We asked if we could have some water, waitress asked "Still or sparkling water?". We asked for still water thinking sparkling water would cost us extra. But no... The still water cost us $12 per bottle. Absolutely horrified, I just felt so ill thinking about having just drank $24 worth of water. I don't recall the price for water being specified on the menu either. Very deceiving.Water + food + dessert cost us $137. Wouldn't rate it. But if you must go, make sure the weather is nice. Maybe we would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't blowing a gale and pouring rain outside. Couldn't even go outside to see the view
3
Held my birthday dinner here and yes it's a cool looking space with incredible views of the city, you feel one with the sky nothing between you and beyond except glass and it's this design that is both exciting and strangely beautiful about this place. We were given a lovely table on the outside deck which is a good place to be. However the food is just awful. Totally overpriced and overall the menu just felt confusing. Hardly any options for veges so was left feeling quite hungry. Go to a hawker centre instead! Service was good v.attentive and really nice staff shame the chef let the house down...definite place to have drinks and soak in the views sky high but you might be better off going elsewhere when it comes to the food

This restaurant is set at the roof top of the marina sands bay skypark (the three buildings with what looks like a boat on the top). Views: Amazing but you will need to reserve a table that's outside in order to get the good views. We sat inside but our table was by the window so we still had good views. You can still go up to the roof top without having to eat at the restaurant but you have to pay $SGD 20 to go to the observation deck. Alternatively you can also stay at the marina sands bay hotel and only then you can experience the infinity pool which appears breathtaking. When we arrived at the restaurant they didn't allow us to go to re observation deck but they did allow us to go after we were done with our dinner. Food: Some dishes were simply amazing. If you go make sure you order the Iberico pork cheeks, the steak, sweet potato crocuettes, tempura prawns, teriyaki chicken. I didn't have anything that want tasty but these were the dishes hat blew me away. Portions are small-ish and some colleagues of mine were hungry still.Drinks: Expensive. Eg a beer comes at 18 Singapore dollars per glass so for Singapore this Is a bit overpriced. Prices overall: Singapore is a city where you can eat cheep and very nice for for less than 10 Singapore dollars. So if you have to fork out 45 average per person for this restaurant then it better be really good.Service: Staff were incredibly attentive and polite. Very impressive service.

So we went for dinner here not the tasting menu - The sashimi was mediocrem the prawns and fish were good but the steak was out of this world! Delicious. Service was impeccable, the belinis left a little to be desired but did the job :
3
I was here as part of a corporate event, and found the place pretty average. The food menu and number of available drinks were both very limited. But they do have the most amazing views of Singapore though - it is worth being here just for that
3
Ku De Ta requires reservations and multiple reconfirmation giving the impression of being very exclusive. on a recent sunday night arriving at1930 there were tables available and many empty tables by 2000. the food is very good, but not outstanding and definitely not worth the high prices. the restaurant was unfortunately a noisy place that seemed to decide that clients want a nice strong percussion beat. not for a romantic peaceful meal. the view from the 57th floor is very impressive. the question for you is how much is a view, Count on spending USD 200 per person at dinner
4
The place has the WOW factor that cant be beaten. The service was attentive and knowledgeable but what was a very expensive meal, we felt the food was just ok. The restaurant caters for a huge amount of customers and perhaps the tasting menu was a poor choice. However the experience is something of a must in singapore
4
Great view! Wheather was not perfect but still. I was there only for some drinks, dancing... and the view. Good service, a bit pricy but it's worth it. Great DJ and party atmosphere.
4
Only here for a drink and the view, but the service was superb from greeting through to the bar, and the cocktail was deliciously well made!
4
Best views of singapore. Very romantic location for a meal out. Cocktails were great even though they were a little pricey.
Food was beautiful and very filling.
Worth a trip.
5
Our experience on the 57 th floor of the marina bay towers was exceptional .... The views are breathtaking ... The bar full of atmosphere and fun ... The food was excellent ... The staff knowledgeable and v friendly . We enjoyed our dinner at a window seat after we had finished our charming waitress said she had reserved a table for us outdoors to enjoy our drinks and soak up the view ... I could not fault this special place ... I hope other visitors have as good a time as we did

We booked the day before and got an answering machine? No call back.. we then called again to leave another message... They finally called back. Reservation taken care of with an indoor city view table. Arrived at 9pm.. got taken outside.. asked to be taken inside... four people stuck to the side under a speaker with no view. complained and was told it was to busy to swap... we ordered the tasting menu. All food was just chucked in the middle of the table..... No presentation at all. The first course of sushi was great but after that just horrible. We asked again to be moved to the table we had booked seeing one was free. Apologies but no change... one staff was nice the other arrogant.... It took an age to get the bill of 680 dollars.... At which point they took my room key to verify my identity... Seriously learn some customer service skills.. how hard is it to answer a phone or book a table??? Not happy we will never go back.

Totally loved this innovative, stylish, and upscale chinese cuisine restaurant offering a breathtaking view of Singapore. This dining experience was definitely a memorable one for me and left me wanting more. The staff was truly professional and attentive while the cuisine was divine. Just a couple constructive criticisms which include -1. Need to make sure you book well in advance. This is not really a criticism since this is a function of the restaurants popularity and success. It's also challenging to get a comfortable table outside; another reason why you need to book well in advance.2. The pan fried fois gras was dry and lacking in fruit and sweetness. I wouldn't recommend this appetizer.3. The menu is a bit pricey but this is to be expected from a unique 5 star restaurant.Try the sweet glazed pork belly as an appetizer. Absolutely a hit !
3
Our group of 12 had dinner here recently and had an ok time of it. The view was spectacular and the service was very good but some of the dishes just were not very good and several dishes were not eaten. I would say the prices were OK here too but drinks are expensive. I would not return here due to the poor food quality - it feels like it doesn't have to try very hard to stay busy
5
Yes, spending 100 dollars per person for brunch may seem like a lot, but at this place it is a bargain, and remember, this is Singapore. First of all, you have the amazing views from the MBS skypark, as the restaurant is located at the very top. The food is incredible. The oysters are superb, the foie gras is amazing, as most of the food you can continue ordering for hours. the food inside the buffet is also great. You can never eat this good, so much, in such a setting, for such a price in Singapore. Make a reservation. Go towards 11 am, stay until 2 or 3 pm. You will not regret i
4
The view from this rooftop bar is simply the best! Of course the prices are high on both dinner and drinks, but you pay for the view - that's the way it is. If we come back to Singapore again, we would probably stay a night at the hotel, just the try the pool and hang out on the roof top all day :
4
Lovely meal with a decent menu. Slightly overpriced but you pay for the location. You're advised to book as it gets v busy. Our table was next to a wooden screen so no view but we did book late. Service was good. Recommend the beef rolls. Have a cocktail after dinner at the bar
4
The view is breathtaking, the prices too ;-) But if you want to get an outstanding view then this bar is really first choice !
5
that Dj has it all together!!! Great music! a little bit crowded on wednesdays as its ladies night but great! We loved it
4
Good food, although a little pricy but wonderful ambiance with an amazing view and great service. I highly recommend the place for a very special evening / a romantic date or even to hang out with friends.
1
just the location, view the most supreme of ku-deta....rest for vegetarians its a nightmare....would just go for drinks here next time, not dinner fosho!!!
3
We went to celebrate with our son and his partner the birth of their twins. Was disappointed not to be allowed on to deck but luckily we sneaked past the guy and enjoyed the stunning view. We were shown to a noisy windy table outside but on request they moved us inside. We chose the tasting drinks and food menu which we all enjoyed but at over Â£ 170 per head it was overpriced.However the overall experience was very pleasant but could not be repeated on a regular basis!
5
By any standard this restaurant would be in the top tier (pardon the pun as it is 57 stories above Singapore's Harbour). The cuisine is delicious and the service impeccable. The atmosphere is subdued and elegant with marvellous views of Singapore. Do not hesitate in ordering the coconut encrusted giant tiger prawns as they are fantastic. After enjoying such a fine meal the only negative is indeed the sticker shock, meal prices are as high as the location, but then again, if on vacation, isn't all about having something memorable to remember? You will always remember this experience and you will regale friends and family with this dinner and the views you enjoyed...do not forget to bring your camera
3
My husband and I were very disappointed to discover that he had to pay $38 to enter bar! We payed over $500 for a hotel room not including meals and now needed to pay for him to go to a hotel bar to enjoy a drink and DJ.. We enjoy our drinks and would have spent well in the bar anyhow but were turned off after being told this. It was a matter of principle and the hotel should change its policy because this distracts from the hotels ambience.

You only come here for the view and experience. You don't come here for the cuisine, service or value.The POSITIVES.The view is absolutely stunning. It is worth the trip. You feel like a millionaire perched up on the 57th floor drinking cocktails.The NEGATIVESIt was very windy to the extent it was a bit uncomfortable - but hey, you are outside on the 57th floor.The service was abysmal. I felt we needed to rugby tackle waiters to get any sort of service. However, when it came to telling us we needed to vacate our table at 6pm as it was reserved for dinner guests, they were all over us. Four staff came up and told us we needed to vacate the table in 20 minutes. Where were you when I wanted to order another drink ?The drinks were pricey but probably what you would expect in a iconic bar like that. Beers were about S$20 each (after VAT and service charge) and the cocktails about S$34 each.I must admit I had a stunning cocktail with black peppercorns that was out of this world and worth the price.SUMMARYWorth the trip for the fantastic views.Be prepared to pay for it.Be prepared to be assertive with the waiters
4
Once we got up there, we decided to have a drink and a bite to eat. In order to do both, we had to eat in the restaurant, but were given a table outside. The view from the table was not great, but the energy up there was terrific. We got our pictures, excellent food (although the last bit was a little tepid) and enjoyed people watching. We managed to keep our table from 6 to 7:30. A memorable evening
3
a very pricy and arrogant club...but i will still recommend for the view of singapore night line. a excellent view from the restaurant, food is average staff is arrogant and drinks are expensive if you want to have club experience there are many other better club in singapore, they need to do quite lot to better their service.Go there have one drink and enjoy the view
3
Mediocre cuisine, overpriced food and beverages, very average service for Singapore luxury hotel. The highlight is the beautiful views of Singapore.
4
Just sip your drinks over the stunning view of the singapore skyline. The food though left a lot to be desired. Still - A must do while in Singapore
5
Have a nice drink, enjoy the views, take some amazing pictures, look at the people and have just a great time!
3
The food was ok, we had the tasting menu, some of it was great and some not so great (mushrooms were slimey).
5
Recently I was touring singapore with my family then my son took me to marina bay sands hotel roof top bar kudeta . We enjoyed the ambiance and ask my son to order some good cocktail from the bar but we were not fix about any cocktail which makes our trip remembered then one of bartender recommended singapore sling for us and we ordered same. The same bartender made the drink and served us, was very good. I really like to thanks the bartender sandip who made our day special . We wish to come again when we are in singapore

My friends and I ate at Ku De Ta during a brief stay in Singapore. We booked two weeks before visiting via the internet.We chose to order the set menu and were all pleased with our food, particularly the sashimi, the mains of fish and mushrooms, and the dessert. The service was good, though we were told that we would be restricted to a 2 hour sitting on arrival due to the poor weather. The view was spectacular.Food and wine here were quite pricey here compared with most other meals we ate during our trip, but we were happy to pay for the overall experience. Also after the meal we were allowed free access into the Ku De Ta bar area, and stayed for a few hours looking out at the spectacular views.We all enjoyed our evening at the restaurant and bar and I would recommend the experience to anyone looking for a special evening in Singapore
4
Well, what to say. The food was good, but portions are a bit small. You must reserve a table to get it but do it a few days before or you'll have a table far from the view, and the viw IS the restaurant, otherwise.... go there and have just a drink! We wanted to move outside and we got it... you'll enjoy your dinner! The price is high, but we expected it, so no surprises. 2 appetizers, 2 main courses, 2 desserts and...ehm, 6 drinks for 280â‚¬
5
I loved KU DE TA and am surprised by some of the reviews. Of course the alcohol is expensive in Singapore. That goes without saying! Try paying $17 for a pint of Guiness in Clark or Robertson Quay. Or $27 for a Singapore Sling at Raffles Hotel. Anyway, we had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. Sat outside in a comfortable table with a million dollar view. The service is exceptional. Wine selection is good. We ordered several dishes. The standout was the Tiger Prawn dish and the Spicy Tuna Roll. We sampled four different desserts and they were all really good as well. Reservations are a must
1
Rude...arrogant...no concept of customer service...a club that clearly believes that it's patrons need it more than it needs it's patrons. If you want to "enjoy" this kind of experience then go to the Club at KuDeTa....or, you could try any number of other clubs in Singapore that actually value their guests and not just their own image....and of course your credit card..
3
We wanted to "crown" our holidays with an exquisite dinner at Ku De Ta, and this was a mistake. The view is sure breathtaking, the food not spectacular but good, the wine list well selected, and nothing to complain about the service.But this restaurant is simply overcrowded with all the 72 nations of the world running around your table, looking at your plates, taking photos and having fun. Nothing wrong with that I believe, but we felt we were at the wrong place at a wrong time. Bad management I would say.Actually, you can't put a restaurant up there, or if you do that please keep the onlookers away. What is the point in offering 1000 + dollar wines when you are obliged to drink it in company of mask wearing chinese tourists and tattooed russians freshly out of the adjacent swimming pool in their bathrobes 
5
The view from this restaurant is unbelievable! The food is good and worth the visit. The service was top notch and not badly priced considering where you were. Our best evening in Singapore!
Not to be missed.
2
The view is the only redeeming feature of the place. The drinks we ordered were very average at best and the food was way below the standard that one expects in marina bay sands
5
Great choice of beautifully mixed cocktails...not too extortionately priced but you'd still need a small mortgage to get really drunk here.
Order the Martini and admire the view.
4
...and i like the place too. nice ambience. good service. easy and tasty food...and gorgeous view of Singapore.
5
Went to this club four nights in a row. Great atmosphere and views. Amazing new years party. A bit pricey but was worth it.
5
I booked the Ku De Ta Brunch last December for a friends 30th birthday. The brunch runs from 10am - 3pm, which is one of the lengthiest in Singapore and also one of the few brunches that you will find on a Saturday in the city. The food and drink menus were generous and there is also a buffet, where you can choose from various savory and sweet bites. The staff were excellent and the views from the restaurant are spectacular. Once the we were finished, we asked to be brought into the Ku De Ta Club next door and they had reserved an outdoor seating area for us, which was a nice touch. I was very happy with the overall experience but save this for special occasions as prices are high here. However, you pay for what you get in Singapore
3
Marina Bay Sands building is definitely number one attraction in Singapore. Unfortunately only hotel guests and members are allowed to visit the famous pool area, therefore, the only option for drinks and dinner is Ku De Ta. The view is simply breathtaking and the outside bar has a great atmosphere with a DJ playing cool tunes. My friends and I had dinner in the restaurant area and having heard that the food is nothing special and quite pricey, we decided to order different sushi variations, which were nothing out of the ordinary. Afterwards we asked to be moved to a terrace table and ordered a bottle of gin, which luckily we could take with us afterwards to the club area. My advice to fellow travelers is: don't expect too much from this restaurant except the amazing location and view and if you do not wish to eat there, better book a table at their club and enjoy your drinks and great party atmosphere! It is definitely the best party place in Singapore!!
4
The food is very good - all the different dishes we tried were perfect. The service was also very good, with enough attention from the staff. The lack of light was solved for reading menus with individual clip on lights - a nice touch. The only thing I thought to be negative was it is a bit noisy - and the background droning of modern lounge music is not necessary for me. Of course - everything said up to now sounds like a normal restaurant, but when you are sitting outside on the 57th floor, overlooking all of Singapore makes this restaurant a unique experience - one worth trying
1
If this restaurant/bar didn't enjoy the great view it has of Singapore, you wouldn't bother...the food is pedestrian, the service is dreadful and the staff are lazy & arrogant...the overall experience is so bad, that it gave fellow diners something to talk about which lifted all of our spirits...the staff at "KU DE TA" in Singapore are so bad they wouldn't get a job serving food at a gas station diner in the middle of a desert...absolutely pathetic !!
3
We came here for Sunday Brunch. There are not many choices. and the appertizers are good. The foie gras is good. Though the food is not impresive, as long as you count it is on top of Marina Bay Sands, the price is reasonable. The views are nice. But, in fact, you can only view a small section. If you really like to walk around to have a 360 degree view, choose to go to skypark instead
4
Worth the visit for the view. It has a cool vibe and cocktails are about SGD20 so not too pricey. You need to book for the restaurant.
5
If you want a memorable night out in Singapore with excellent food and an unbeatable view, Ku De Ta is your best bet! The crispy-sticky baby squid and the pork belly will stick out in my mind for a long time as they were amazing! The view will take your mind off the slightly overpriced wine list. Be sure to make reservations
3
Went here in December with friends celebrating their engagement so as an event,the place proved to be a poor choice. The food is a very poor imitation of SE Asian flavours,dumbed down we assumed for tourist tastes and the service was not much better with long waits for our waiter to even ask for our drinks orders and the food took a long time also. However,given the occasion everyone was prepared to overlook this. That said the view was superb and with after dinner drinks on the terrace,the disappointments of Ku De Ta were soon forgotten but none of us wil go there again
5
A glass of wine starts at $19SGD , a bottle of wine starts at $89SGD, Cocktails starts at $20 SGD. However expect feeling ontop of the world with the view, excellent service and tapas style food with a chinese influence. The food was sensational. We booked early and arrived half an hour early which proved a great idea, because we went to the stand up bar and enjoyed a quiet cocktail, some photos etc before the crowds packed this little bar. We booked online in advance. Don't go to the Skypark entrance, go to the conceirge in the Marina Bay Hotel and get a pass (they didn't even check our booking reservation). Once up on the top save room for an after dinner drink in the KU DE TA Lounge/ Bar/ Club which is in a different section. We were not allowed onto the SkyDeck part of the hotel but still had fantastic views. I was expecting to be lounging by the pool but the restaurant does not overlook the pool - if your in a group request to be seated outside on the lounge chairs because you will be right beside the amazing views. Sit back, relax and enjoy this amazing experience like we did

I loved the restaurant! The food is brilliant and designed to be shared by the table. The only criticism I have is the lighting, I understand that it creates atmosphere but really it was to the point where we could hardly see the food. The menu's came with little torches but part of the experience should be eating with our eyes
5
We were going to have dinner at Ku De' Ta and decided to have a pre dinner drink at the Skybar. The views are amazing! There was a storm rolling in and it was spectacular to watch the lightning! The drinks are expensive but well worth it for the view

I was bringing an indonesian family (7 adults, 1 kid) who wanted to have dinner in KUDETA. Then I called KUDETA to reserve the table for 9pm. I told them that we are 8 adults (including me) and 1 kid Then the girl on the phone said "Sorry madam, we are not accepting kid to go here" And i asked again "Really? It is a family dinner" , and still she said "Yes madam, kid cant go here". So I decided to just forget about KUDETA and booked another restaurant with the skybar in Raffles Place. Around 5 pm that day, KUDETA called me and asked me to confirm that I will go to KUDETA tonight or not. And I was like "I think I said I will not book the table anymore since you said that kid cant come".. And she said "No, madam. The kid is not allowed to go to the club". I was shocked because i didnt talk about club before and emphasized that it is gonna be a family dinner, then I said "No, I didnt talk about the club before, I was talking about the restaurant." And she still tried to show that she was right. I cancelled the booking for another restaurant immediately (I prefer kudeta view , Ive been to the club and it was cool)Anyway, since kid now allowed, I said "Ok, 9pm then for 8 adults (including me) and 1 kid"She said "OK madam, but for your information, we need you credit card details such as card number, security code, and expiry date and if you not coming at 9pm, we will charge you SGD 50 per person". I was like "What? no way, it is really weird if we tell other people about our credit card, how can you guarantee that no one will use it for other purpose?"She said "No madam, we can keep the information as a company secret"I said "then nevermind, just cancel the booking please"She said again "Hmm, okay madam, no need credit card just come here at 9pm, if you late more than 30 minute, we will give the table to other people". I said "OK. c u "In this case, that was obvious that the restaurant call service was showing her UN-PROFESSIONALISM . Come on , everyone know KUDETA as located on the highest point of Marina Bay Sands and the hotline service was really terrible, confusing, and upsetting. And it was weird that she just easily letting me to not giving my CC details. And the night after, we went there and had some food. The price was so expensive especially for the dessert like Mango mouse, it was like really tiny, yes really tiny, and it cost around 17SGD the other food were like average. Better go to chinese restaurant I guess. But the roasted small salmon was OK and cost around 37 SGD.So, I think If you wanna go there, think twice
4
We went at lunch time. The restaurant is fine dining so expect those prices and servings. Food was beautifully presented and high quality. I had the bento box and highly recommend it. Teriyaki chicken was divine. View s not good. You will get a better view from the sky bar and we were not able to see the skylark at all
4
The view is stunning. Worth arriving late evening to take in both the day time and night views. Its exciting just to be up here, right on top of Singapore. The food and service were okay - no complaints but not memorable - but that's not the point of going to Ku De Ta anyway
4
The 4 of us had drinks here before dinner. The view is spectacular. The drinks are expensive...a Singapore Sling is $30 and a small bottle of still water was $9. The music throbs as throngs of well heeled people from all around the world gather in this "happening" place
5
Four of us enjoyed dinner at the Kudeta on top of the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, We ordered 8 appetizers and 2 desserts. The food was exquisite and expensive, even for Singapore. A bottle of still water was $12 and the meal for 4 people without entree or drinks was $250. The service was exceptional...gracious and efficient. And the view of the city and harbor at night was absolutely spectacular. I would have paid $250 just for the view. It was a very special night that we will always treasure
3
We booked thinking we were going to have magnificent views from our table but there is a row of bushes blocking the view of many of the tables! The standup tables for drinking get all the views. The food was acceptable Asian but were on the small side and the prices were on the larger side. Dessert was the highlight. I reckon that, if you are staying in the hotel, then you can see the view from the pool or the visitors deck. Go to a better restaurant in the shopping centre or why not eat at some local-style restaurants and have much tastier food
4
View is beautiful and worth having a drink just to enjoy. But the drinks are way overpriced, and the food mediocre for the fare. I would enjoy just a drink here and head somewhere else. On your way out, head to the club which is around the corner to see the infinity pool overlooking Singapore. It is truly an amazing site
5
Yes the view from level 57 is great, but if you moved this place to the basement it would still rock! Having visited the venue several times over the last few months, KU DE TA seems to get better each time, thanks again to Dean and the team, looking forward to my next visit to Singapore in Jan for another great night
4
The name says it all. Indeed its in sky :) Super place for Dinner. Amazing view over the harbour and city at night. Its at the top most floor on marina by the bay. We will surely recoomend this to every1 who are visiting the Singapore. You will not be disappointed. Food is bit expensive but the view compensates everything. Service can be improved
1
We were booked in at 9.30pm on Sunday December 30th. Let me say at the outset that the views from the restaurant are spectacular. The infinity pool looked stunning. The evening was looking promising. From that point it all rather went downhill. Apart from my wife's starter of soft shell crab which was lovely, the rest of the food was poor and unconvincing. I had miso salmon Sashimi. Boy was that salmon bland. Absolutely no taste at all. I had to ask for some soy sauce to give it some seasoning. My wife then ordered the tempura prawns. The prawns were juicy but again were bland in taste and the coating of tempura batter was so thin, one's mouth barely registered a crunch of any kind. I ordered the halibut which was marinated then oven roasted. It was barely warm when it came to the table so I sent it back. Twenty minutes later it came back with the waiter proudly boasting how it has just left the oven. However, it was as cool as the first one and when I put my fork into the fish it squelched into a mush and oil oozed to the top. It was truly disgusting. Halibut is one of the kings of the sea. It's a firm, meaty fish that flakes beautifully. This chef had totally ruined it. Our side dishes of asparagus and thai fried rice were cold by now (no replacements were offered). I was past eating at this point. To make matters worse, our first two choices of wine were not available and the woman on the table next to us obviously enjoyed her meal so much, she brought it all back up - all over her table and the floor. I asked for the duty manager. She was very apologetic. The bill was sorted to our satisfaction, but the night was ruined. I note the mixed reviews on this site for the food. Some people have clearly had an excellent dining experience. Many have not. The restaurant sells itself on the spectacular views and the fine Asian dining. While the quality of the view is without parallel, the same cant be said about the food. The two must go hand in hand for the experience to be memorable. If your going to have security at every door and lift checking your booking as well as a roped off bar where you are only allowed in if you agree to a minimum spend of approximately £250-300 (and so giving the illusion of exclusivity) then it's imperative to ensure that your product is water tight in terms of its quality. From our experience, Ku de Ta has a long way to go

I had not quite a good impression with the place. I called to make a reservation but was told the next available table would at 9.30pm. Since the dress code is casual smart, i inquired whether it's alright if i'm wearing pair sandals. I was told no! Husband not satisfied with that decided to just walk in. To my disbelief, there was a table available and saw a man dinning with a short & singlet wearing strappy sandals!!! The foods was not that fantastic. overpriced i must say. Nevertheless the view of Singapore from the restaurant is just breathtaking
3
Just had cocktails with friends. High price as expected due to location. The virgin piña colada needed four sips to finish. Leaving behind pristine ice cubes from top to bottom. Other cocktails did not leave a wow factor. Not much of view from bar tables as the skypark view deck blocks most of the view. Squashed for space so you have to bump everyone to get somewhere. Overall, an okay once off experience. People get impressed by the location so might come back for the impressions for my visitors. Not sure what more can be improved as its a tight space for the bar next to resturant.
5
Could not get in for lunch so booked in for dinner, could only get 10:30 table. We arrived at 9:30 and seated us striaght away.DJ was good, atmosphere also good, a little dark though which we like anyway. We had a range of dishes - sushi / pork belly / squid / tetaki / mushrooms / salads / prawns as well as a great bottle of Reisling from France and was under S$300. Overall food was good, not as good as in Seminyak (Bali) but would go back for sure... Make sure you book in advance.
2
Ok Japanese food, definitely not the best I've had but nice. I would expect more for the price. The service is absolutely shocking as we had to keep asking for our food to be brought out as they forgot half of the items on the menu. The cocktails were terrible and at $25 each I expected a lot better. It also took about half an hour for a round of drinks to come out each time and the restaurant was half empty. The worst part was when we queried an overcharge on the bill for drinks not only did they refuse to remove it from the bill the waitress then told me "if you didn't want to pay for it, you shouldn't have ordered it" $800 later for 4 people I would defiantly take my money elseweher
1
A joke, so full of themselves and nomanners or class, as complet rip off as you can imagine, poor drinks, stupid prices.
Great view
5
Wot a amazing place to dine. 57 floors up with spectacular views over Singapore. The food was to die for and the service of Tristan and his team was 1st class. We will be back again someday.
Cheers Mr Shane.

Nothing in the restaurant was exceptional on it's own, but overall it does offer a great dining experience. Located in the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the restaurant has it's own lift that takes you to the top of the hotel and restaurant.The baby octopus and the tempura selections on the menu were fab. The drinks were well prepared as well, but I would not recommend the wine. In additional to staff who could not recommend the appropriate wine that could accompany the meal, the wine I received was corked. Although matter was resolved quickly with a replacement, it was something that was unnecessary. If I go again I will stay with the cocktails and beer.The prices are not for the faint hearted, but I again it is part of the Singapore experience, which I would recommend
5
Dined here one night during my stay at Maina Bay Sands. Staff were very attentive and efficient and always made sure we were looked after. Food was amazing, highly recommend the tapas style tasting plates to ensure you have a bit of everything. Oh, the view is pretty spectacular too
1
If you righfully assumed that you would get a drop-dead-gorgeous view to accompany the sky-high prices (think 750ml of bubbly water priced at SGD 12++), you're in for a brusque surprise: even the window seats are blocked by the surrounding lounge, and all you get to see is the very top of a few downtwowk buildings on one side, the sprawl of the suburbs in the middle, and the far sea on the other. When we tried to go see the view from the deck that is accessible from the restaurant, we were told that as non-hotel guests we had to go back down to the bottom and queue up to buy a "SkyPark" access.Very disappointed. Food is actually quite good, but not at those prices
4
The view is amazing looking out over the whole marina areaThe menu is interesting, bit like ordering tapas dishes, mix. And match with your other diners, everything comes at different speeds but it just works. Some variation on old favourites but some Asian fusion new conceptsYou can drink outside but get there early Book in advance for dinnerStaff and service greatA little over priced but worth a visi

We came here to celebrate my wife's birthday, which also happens to fall on Christmas eve. For starters we had a foie gras sushi maki and an Alaskan king crab california maki. We felt that the foie gras didn't really fit in and the Alaskan crab was wasted in the roll. We are both very discerning diners and yet we wouldn't have been able to tell if it were Alaskan crab or just a humble crab stick in there. These 2 starters would not be out of place at a casual sushi joint for a fraction of the price.Next we had pan seared foie gras, which was waaay over cooked and very disappointing. For main courses we had a braised pork cheek and a 100 days grain fed tenderloin, which was just ok for a $56 dish. Overall, we didn't get the Japanese - fusion (or confusion?) concept.The redeeming factors were the ambience, the view, and the waiver of cover charge into the club
5
Trust me I'm not fat at all but I left this restaurant hungry! I'm vegetarian and ordered 5 vegetable dishes - they also need a wider range for vegans/vegetarians, having said that quite used to this!! I also shared a desert with my friend and that was exquisite - service was attentive but they were always hovering. Should give you some space to relax, we also had done drinks outside prior to eating and watched the sun go down a very nice highlight
5
Well, one often goes to a restaurant in the sky with high hopes and comes away with a dining experience of lowlights.... Not this time! Whilst its not 'cheap and good' - as is the mantra in Singapore, its quality that counts. The service PJ and Bonnie gave was flawless. Whilst shared entrees and mains were superb, the food was highlighted by the exclamation mark of dessert! We tried the chef's signature bounty cake and were not disappointed. Light yuzu (citrus) marshmallows danced around a bitter chocolate and coconut timbale and made our dinner a complete success - until our host recommended we order more....the Whisky Cake with white chocolate crumble was just as delicious as the former - a whisky soaked brioche over a delicious salted white chocolate crumble and passionfruit sorbet. They are truly an exclamation mark on what would be for many a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience here in Singapore.I say make it a date and make it a special occasion. Bring your wallet and splash in style
5
Enjoyed a memorable evening at Ku De Ta restaurant; atmosphere, meal & service all of a fantastic standard.Wait staff were attentive, helpful and courteous. Food was modern, flavoursome & was enjoyed over sweeping views of the entire city skyline..atmosphere was 10/10.Shared 6 different dishes between 2 over a bottle of wine and finished with a shared dessert. Would definitely recommend as a venue to impress or to simply enjoy a cool evening out
3
Come and view the sunset at the Kudeta Skybar you can feel the city beneath you in the middle of a great crowd and be served by great staff however the food is average.
5
Very good fusion food. Nice presentation. Food is served to share so everything comes in the middle as they come out from the kitchen. Service is efficient but you are very close to your neighbor and its very noisy.
4
The scenario is impressive! But you cant help the feeling that you are being assaulted!The food is good and staff great, but the portions are incredibly small!!! The main courses look like starters in many other restaurante of the same level.Considering the portions, EXTREMLY overpriced!Its anoying to have pepole sight seeng just next to you and taking pictures while your having dinner! They should not allow it!Also, since when the reservation was done, tell told us about the dress code.....but just for the ones having dinner....the "turists" are alowed in flipflops and shorts and pretty much anything else!If you go there fior a drink its ok, for dinner dont recomend, many other places in singapore cheaper and with bigger portions
5
I had the pleasure of dining at Ku De Ta on 7/12/12. Staff were very friendly and attentive. The food was great! Small sharing plates. We had soft shell crab, tempura prawns, kai lan, sticky squid, and tuna sushi. All were great!The veune has an amazing view over Singapore. We also had a drink at the bar outside - spectacular!Would recommend to those wanting something special..

I normally don't write reviews on tripadvisor, but the wonderful experience I had at Ku De Ta restaurant makes me willing to write one for them. First of all, I made a reservation online with them a week back before the dinner, indicating that I will be proposing to my girlfriend during the dinner. There wasn't any reply from them though whether my reservation was confirmed and I made a call during the afternoon just in case. When we reached there at 6pm on a Fri night, a complimentary cocktail was served to us, which was very sweet of them. The eating style was slightly different from other places in that the dishes on the menu were meant to be shared among the diners, instead of the usual set meal kind. The staff at there were aplenty and attentive to our needs. I proposed after the dinner, and the staff volunteered to take photographs for us. And soon after that, they offered another complimentary dessert, even though we had ordered one right at the start of the dinner. After the dinner, we are able to access the alfresco bar portion of Ku De Ta to enjoy the wonderful and breathtaking skyline of Singapore. All and all, their kind gestures and the restaurant ambience have really made our experience truly unforgettable

I wish to have a great dinner by making a reservation at Kudeta Restaurant when I was staying at Marin Bay Sands Hotel. The reception advised me to come on 10 pm due to the traffic customer. Unfortunately when we come there at around 10 pm, the customer service told me that we can order any food as the kitchen will be closed 30 mnt later. Then they advise just to order the drink and standing at drinking Bar (chair and table are for eating only). Little bit disappointed because we hope that we will have a good dinner at Kudeta on that day, and we already felt hungry as we have waited 10 pm to come before. We stand at the drinking Bar and the situation around is so crowded, so we even cannot stand comfortably, until we decided to come back to our room. Finally I order the food from my room for dinner
2
Drop by Kudeta Skybar with the intention to have pre-dinner drinks and to check out the sunset view given the allure of the much rave about 57th storey panaromic view.Unfortunately the setting was not as posh as depicted in the website, in fact i thought the setting was terrible. There are no seating area for those wanting to have a drink or two, only standing area with high tables which is very limited. They do have seating area but it was cordonned off with velvet ropes or are either reserved. Perhaps you'll need reservation and spend x amount to get a spot.I could have been content with just standing and having a drink but it was pack by 6.30 pm on a Fri evening, also it didn't have the chill out ambiance of the original Kudeta at Seminyak, Bali.Took a glance at the area and since no one approached us to attempt to seat us or to at least let us know the place is full. We decided to head elsewhere
5
My daughter turned18 and we wanted to make her evening memorable. Ku De Ta was recommended to us so we went along in high hope. We weren't let downUpon arrival we were promptly seated and our waiter explained how everything ran, which was helpful. We then proceeded to order our drinks and meal, all of which were delivered with great care and attention and promptness. The food was really tasty and thoroughly enjoyable. Perhaps, the duck was slightly under-cooked but that's just me personal preference.A lovely cake was brought to my daughter by the restaurant as a celebratory note for her birthday which was a nice touch - it was also a nice cake! We then went outside to the bar area for a drinkAlthough not the cheapest place in town, the service and quality of food made up for the cost.Only "criticism" was maybe before being seated for dinner, we could have been asked if we wanted a drink at the bar first, especially as we were a little early but this shouldn't take off any glos
5
My friends and I had 5 hours layover in Singapore and decided to tour the city. Was recommended to dine in Kudeta as we were going to visit Marina Bay sands hotel. At first, we were a bit apprehensive with the posh environment and haughty receptionist but as we sat down we were quickly put at ease with the warm welcome of our waitress. We were served by Katherine who was wonderful, very helpful and attentive despite the lunch crowd. She advised us to get the japanese bento boxes (which we had-YUMMY!)as we are in a hurry and then add some of their tasty appetisers. We were blown away by the crispy calamari with lime and pepper sauce and the fresh snapper sashimi with truffles. When we mentioned to Shari the maitre d' that we would have loved to be seated on the terrace but was told it was fully booked, she quickly arranged a table for us and suggested we take our desserts there. The superb pina colada jello that came with the bento and the kudeta coffee was a fantastic end for our lunch. when you visit KUDETA, look for these 2 lovely ladies to serve you
5
We had a excellent service and great meals. The waiter did everything to make our stay unforgettable. We had a nice table at the window site and the waiter helped to find the perfect meal for us. The food (Asian/ European) was excellent. We had lamb and Iberico pork with Asian spice - thatwas very delicious.The dessert as well were excellent and not standard. This is the same for the cocktails. All over we had a perfect evening at the Ku De Ta
5
We had a perfect service and the Asian / European cuisine is at it´s best.
Also it is great that guests of the restaurant can use the view terrace without an extra fee
5
everything was great, meal, drinks, service. exactly how you like to enjoy a nice evening out in a extraordinary city! Leonardo did an excellent job, gave superb recommendations and seems to pamper his guests in a great way.
5
Another grest night at KU DE TA,dined with 8 others, the food was fresh and tasty, service smooth and we stated til close finishing at he bar, highly recommended for dinner and a drink.
4
Delicious food although pricey. Great views unless the weather doesn't cooperate in which case you're up so high you're almost in the cloud itself!
3
Couldn't pass up such an icon for lunch. Views were spectacular, the sofas instead of chairs at some of the dining tables were not high enough to eat from and the seating cushions wouldn't stay in place. This was a pain. The food came out promptly and was good. The staff were hard to get hold of... Avoiding eye contact at any opportunity. Has to be done at least. Once, there is better in Sing. Now the cake shop in the lobby was great - that was where we did dessert yyyyuuuumm
5
I have traveled all over the world, have friends who are world class chefs and have been fortunate to have eaten at some of the best restaurants that money can buy and this place just blew my mind.First of all the view is to die for, the service is impeccable and everything we ate made you want to chew as slow as humanly possible, as to enjoy as savor every second.I absolutely will be coming back here and dreaming about it until I can!!!!
2
As the title says, food was very good, service was very bad. Our drinks arrived after the first of our starters and the order was wrong. Our mains arrived and 50% of the order was wrong. We then ordered desert and after waiting 20minutes we asked the waitress and the look on her face told us all we needed to know- she had forgotten to order them! We were comp'd one round of drinks for the starter and main course issues but were surprised to be told the service charge couldn't be removed when we suggested it wasn't deserved!! In the end something was sorted out. A real shame the service didn't match the lovely food.
2
It might be 57 floors up but thats irrelevant unless you get a good seat and none of the seats are panoramic due to the location of the restaurant. We paid good money for a terrible sushi (hardly any tuna in it), some over dried-up calamaris. The salmon on the next table (very close) had nice piece of marinated salmon. Go elsewhere for food and just go to level 57 and see the views
4
We got there around 5:30. Got a table without a reservation - had the feeling that's unusual. Great view, especially as the sun started to set and the night scene started to light up. Great people watching as you get everything - tourists, college kids reluctantly having dinner with Mom and Dad, night stalkers :
2
Obviously a cracking view, somewhat spoiled by surly staff, slow service (more efficient to go to the bar, find a menu and order yourself), below par cocktails and a policy of kicking people out who are wearing flip flops past 6pm (it's not like it's classy enough to justify a dress code). Go for one, but don't expect to stay too long, cocktails at the top of the swisshotel are much better value, and view is almost as good
4
Offers one of the best views in Singapore. This is an excellent place to get a drink and soak in the views of the city.
5
With Sky57 across the Skypark, this restaurant can be overlooked, but don't. The food is top notch -- probably a better value than Sky57, but more casual. Open to the bar area which is sexy and fun at night. Highly recommend!
5
Come and view the sunset at the Kudeta Skybar with someone you love, someone you like, feel the city beneath you, be in the middle of a great crowd and be served by great staff
4
Decided to head down to Ku De Ta with my best friend for dinner catch up. It was really a pity as we did not get to sit outside due to the bad weather. The ambiance of the restaurant was rather comfortable and nice, dim lights with small little table lamps. For a date, this is the a good place!This restaurant is more towards a family style, whereby instead each person having a share, everyone share together!I must admit that the crispy-sticky fried squid is really nice, and also the spicy tuna roll. THE PORK BELLY LOLLIPOP TOO!!! A MUST MUST TRY: BABY CHICKEN TERRIYAKI!!For the dessert, i would really say: WOW to the "Apple & honey" - refreshing, and you won't get sick of it.A great experience for me and my friend to catch up, and for lovers' dating place. After eating, you can also go to the pub nearby to have a chill night
1
Went for brunch and won’t be going back here; this is not the only place in town with a great view. It is way over-priced but more distasteful to us is the pompous and pretentious vibe of this restaurant. The entire place reeks of affected self-importance, the waiters/staff are more “posh” than the patrons, just too cool for school. Unpleasant ambiance in a city full of other amazing venues
3
If you want to enjoy the great view from the roof of Marina Bay Sands hotel, chose the lounge or sit at the terrace. I can't understand some of the other comments here saying how great the food is; personally I was really disappointed, in particular because I was expecting something close to the experience of Ku-De-Ta in Bali. Nothing close to it.We had a salad (with an horribly too sweet teriyaki style dressing), a tasteless foie gras, a tasteless (again) white tuna with avocado sauce, a too sweet (again!) chicken teriyaki, and some badly cooked squash. The bill (with a nice bottle of Italian wine worth S$99) came up to S$304 for 2 persons, which I find excessive considering the poor quality of the food.The service was fast and friendly. At least a good poin
3
We had a dinner in KuDeTa and the place was completely full of people. Food was nice but menu was not rich. It's good idea to go there once for a light dinner and drinks. This place is made for investment bankers who want to impress their clients :
4
When booking the restaurant told them it was our Honeymoon and even on busy Saturday night they were able to provide us with a great outside table. We also received a complementary Champagne cocktail which was a nice touch.Food is great, we opted for a mix of the Japanese inspired dishes. The low lighting means that the skyline across the bay takes centre stage. A great dining experience
2
We had booked to go here for my birthday dinner. Having read a bunch of reviews, I was not expecting much of the food, but were really disappointed when they seated us away from the window, which didn't spoil the view...because the windows were covered in condensation and you couldn't see out anyway!I really didn't want to stay and eat overpriced, average food, so opted to stand up outside for an overpriced, average drink
4
Definitely Kudeta is worth the visit for its terrific view on top of the Marina Bay Sands. The Asian fusion food is good but do not expect highly gastronomical dishes despite the prices. Advice is to join the place late afternoon, enjoy few drinks at the bar with some local business people before sitting at your outdoor table for a nice dinner, while the sun goes down and the city lights turn on! Amazing experience
4
It's a good restaurant, which has a fantastic view, and where the food is good. The service is friendly. The only negative point is that this restaurant is a bit too much expensive.
4
Good food with prices to match but one of the best views in SIngapore. Take a camera and if you like pork belly give it a go here. Really enjoyed it!
5
Nice dinner, perfect menu - we choose the wine dinner but service was so fast that we felt rushed out of the restaurant. but amazing overall.
4
Celebrated my wife's birthday at Ku De Ta and it was the right place for a special occasion. We enjoyed the Seared Black Angus Beef Tataki & the Pan Seared Hokkaido Scallops, great taste and perfectly cooked, the standouts for our meal there. We also had the Sliced Semi-Fatty Bluefin Tuna & Grilled Australian Lamb Rack which were good but not as outstanding. Lastly, as I made known it was a birthday celebration, the restaurant provided a complimentary Bounty Cake with a lighted candle, nice touch. The cake was quite excellent, bitter chocolate with coconut within and served with delightful marshmallows. After dinner, we strolled the sky park and enjoyed the best view in Singapore
5
Wow what a night,  From the moment we arrived at this magnificent establishment all our expectations were meet,yes the view does have an impact, however the quality of the food,not to mention the service all made for an unforgettable evening.The staff were so friendly and professional thanks to all the great staff for making our night such a memorable occasion.... Cheers E
3
Went here and was greatly disappointed with the food. Out of all the dishes we tried, the rib eye was the best. Others were so-so. The service hovered the whole time we were seated as if rushing us to eat. Next time, I'll just go for drinks at the bar and still get the view
4
Had a 40th birthday celebration at Ku De Ta, portion sizes were suitable as you had several dishes to eat, this restaurant is based on several small dishes ordered and shared between yourselves or the group whatever your preference, great way to try several dishes and experience amazing taste sensations, cocktails arent cheap but I dont know where you would get cheap cocktails at prime realestate in 1st world countries - one thing is they dont scrimp on the gin serving when ordering a G&T!! Our table ordered an average 6 dishes per couple for mains and one dish for dessert and we had approx 8 drinks per couple at a cost of $350 singapore per couple, not bad I think for a great night out! Didnt have to wait for service, waiters were on the ball, would come back again

The staff were so accommodating giving us the table we wanted in a quieter area of the restaurant. The views from the top of MBS hotel are fantastic and worth the visit alone but the food really does live up to the location. It's an innovative Asian menu that has been well thought out and perfect for sharing with friends. It's not cheap but the overall experience justifies the price. Highly recommended

I took my family and a friend to a Sunday brunch at Ku De Ta. The view is great but the rest of the dining experience was simply awful. The Black Angus goulash dish really did taste like dog food. A plate of three oysters was an absolute disappointment. The salads were not crisp. For the nearly $600 that a brunch cost us I shall certainly not return. This is a restaurant that is capitalising on its location and view. I would rather enjoy good food in a windowless basement than endure another meal at Ku De T
5
Had the opportunity to have dinner here with colleagues. The view was of course nothing short of spectacular. The menu was interesting and diverse. We were a little unsure how much to order given the "family style" serving method. The staff provided excellent guidance as well as suggestions. I'd have to say that every single dish was truly excellent and I would dine here again for sure. Given I was staying in the hotel I'd be hard pressed to justify the effort to go out for dinner given this was so goo

Liked lamb steak and fried calamari. Great view at the top of marina bay sands and reasonable compare to other at the top. Have good bar also.
5
On our recent stay in Marina Bay Sands Hotel Singapore, we had the pleasure of dining in the Ku De Ta restaurant within the complex. The view of course was magic and the service was excellent. Our every need was attended to. The food was fantastic & we were allowed to share every dish. They actually provided extra plates for this purpose. The wine was vey very good. The whole dining experience was love - a little on the expensive side but well worth it

My wife and I visited the Ku De Ta at The Marina Bay Sands Hotel to compare it with Sirocco in Bangkok. While both sky bars have excellent views I am afraid Ku De Ta loses me with its over the top prices for drinks. Singapore is not a cheap city anymore but close to S$20 for a Tiger beer with no glass is too dear. Plus a bottle of NZ wine which retails in Australia for AU$20 for S$120++ is just something I will repeat. The cost of a beer at the Sirocco in Bangkok is about AU$10 and the setting is far better. With cheap flights one could almost fly to Bangkok and enjoy a night up there for the same money as going to Ku De Ta
3
We went a couple of times to KuDeTa. Nearly every time it underperformes and does not meet expectations. The place is packed and full of people (mostly guys on business trips) since it is mostly outdoor the whole place is one big smoking section. Air quality is quiet disgusting. Also went for dinner once and have to say that the food is super overrated and very expensive. The location however is pretty unbeatable.
1
When I went, everything was horrible. The drinks, the food, the service, just about everything you can think of. Lots of people playing dress up and pretending to look comfortable when in fact their shoes were painful, ther jackets were too hot, their over-gelled hair was running or they were worried their mini skirts might hike up at any given moment. Perhaps if you're visiting Singapore for the first time, go check out the view but this pretentious spot certainly doesn't validate much more than that
5
The restaurang itself is so very special. The food is outstanding . My 3 friends and I have been treveling together for 26 years in different places every year so this time it was Singapores turn We have never got so good food befor. Fantastic staff, nice presentation of the food. They realy took very god care of us So out of 5 stars we give them 
2
Ok so - you are at the top of the world... so we went to the restaurant (party of 20 = huge bill) and the view is without fault... But the food is just cheap regular Singapore uninspired food...So go for the experience andthe photo op... but dont get all exciited about have a great meal... sorry just sayin..

The restaurant promised so much, being on the top floor of the Marina Bay Sands and having eaten at their Bali restaurant we thought we were in for a treat. We couldn't have been more wrong. Firstly we enquired for a booking via their website and were told they had tables from 10pm and so we e-mailed back within 5 minutes only to be told that they had no tables at all that evening. It was only when we reminded them of their previous e-mail that our table was booked. This we could get over but the minute we were directed to the lift for the restaurant we encountered rude, disinterested staff which didn't improve when we got to the restaurant. We were kept waiting at reception for a very long time even though the table that we were eventually shown to had been empty since our arrival. We ordered our food and drinks at the same time as it took the waiter an eternity to come to take our order and when the food did eventually arrive , I had still not been given my drink which we had reminded them about several times. The food was okay but not worth the money charged. We then asked whether we could take our drinks to the outside bar area to finish them and to have a look at the view and were told that we could stand only as the seating area had a minimum charge, this despite that fact that we had less than half a glass of wine left. The attitude of the staff and the tardiness of the service really let this place down and unless you want pretentious waiters ignoring you the whole evening, avoid this place, its not worth it simply for the view
5
We wanted to enjoy the amazing sunset on Singapore's bay from Marina Bay Sands hotel, but since we did not stay in the hotel, we settled for a drink the Kudeta, the view is the same and amazing. Drinks are not cheap but you can't beat this view
4
Amazing location, good food - a little pricey but you have to pay for the location.Service was what let the place down. Off hand, careless and constantly removing plates before the other diner has finished. They need to focus on there service to make this a great restaurant and not just a tourism attraction with food
5
Well this is worth paying a the price for a cocktail to just sit and take in the view. The staff are excellent and the service is beyond question. Worth the price tag of the drinks.
1
brought my friend from out of town there. we ordered a bottle of standard white chardonnay, 2 bottles of sparkling water, a few sushi/sashimi and one fish. the bill came to over sgd 500. the seating was outside. neither a view nor anything else that i would consider 'special'. the food was good, the table was average, the atmosphere was average at best. i m giving one point only for the overall rating as it certainly came nowhere close to meet my expectations
5
We had a very pleasant evening with good food. We tried also their Takara Ranch beef which was very tasty and would recommend to try eat. The views are also amazing from this restaurant. They have 2 sommeliers and i have to say that 1 of them has a very extensive knowledge (from the other we do not know as we only met him 1 time at our table). They serve wine with no sulfates, even by the glass, hence would recommend to combine this with the Takara beef. All other dishes were also tasty. The price is acceptable for the atmosphere, service and food quality. the reception downstairs is somewhat rude, but as someone else who already made the remark, this is probably because a lot of people just want to go to the upper deck to have the view without having actually a cocktail or going for the restaurant. We would recommend this restaurant
3
We were on our honeymoon and the concierge in our hotel recommended a visit. Unfortunately there was trorrential rain so we had to abandon our outdoor seats with the amazing views and sit indoors. The mood lighting is so extreme there is a torch on top of the menus - slightly ridiculous. Also the deating is very close together so you are aware of others very close to you and their conversation which is a little off putting. The staff were helpful if a little disconcerning the fact they hovered a little too close for my liking. But we were treated to a lovely champagne cocktails from the restuarant to celebrate our honeymoon which was kind. The food itself is lovely - we had lovely tempura vegetable, exquisit lamb and very good cocktails. For the price we paid, it definately was not worth it, but you go more for the experience of the views and the hotel itself. Although after a while it is a little off putting having so many people milling around taking photos of the views etc; they should maybe section off an area for those using the restaurant
2
Went there for my lady's birthday. Dress code not enforced so while we dressed for the occasion only to end up dining amongst people wear shorts, t-shirts & thongs.The food was nothing special and the presentation was poor.Staff need proper training, you don't remove bowls, plates etc when the guests are still eating the course.The only saving graces for the night were the head waiter & the view.Wouldn't waste my time & money by going back for dinner. If you want the view, go for a drink only
5
Loved our time at Ku De Ta. Yes it is expensive but it's a once in a lifetime experience. We enjoyed the food, two entrees and a main we shared. The carpaccio of swordfish was wonderful and the Venison was to die for as a shared main. The wine was spastic as far as price was concerned but we still loved it. When we had finished our meal we decided to go out onto the terrace and finish our wine. The staff were fantastic, picked up the wine bucket and found us a spot on the terrace. Yeah !!! What an incredible viewâ€¦.

Situated on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel it's a must do while in Singapore, if only for the amazing views. The coctails served are very good but are certainly not cheap. The prices quoted are subject to a further 10% service charge and 7% GST. A glass of wine and a bottle of beer is 45$ Sing(23 pounds).The food served in the restaurant was very tasty. We started with oysters, followed by Tempura King Prawn & Squid, Pan seared duck with wok fried rice and shitake mushrooms. We sent the duck and rice back as it was cold when it arrived. The management dealt with this quickly and the replacement dishes were fine (duck was slightly over cooked, but acceptable). We washed it down with a nice bottle of French red wine. The desserts were also very tasty. My one complaint would be that you cannot admire the view of the city from the tables because of the shrubbery placed around the restaurant (to provide some public areas???).Overall the food and service was good
5
WOW! If you get the chance do yourself a favour and book this restaurant! BOOK EARLY!! The food was incredibly delicious, inventive and plenty to choose from. We drank at the bar before being seated and could hardly take our eyes of the view! The atmosphere was fantastic (it was Saturday night). The service GREAT. We were also thrilled when at the end of our night (after we asked) they reserved a section for us at the Ku De Ta CLUB to continue on partying. WOW WOW WOW! A night to remember. Thank you Ku De Ta... Love the Strawberry Mojitos & Pork lollypops
5
What a venue, sooooo cool.Visited the bar and was amazed by the views over Singapore but more so by the pool. At night it is a little crazy to see people swimming at 10 pm, all out by 11pm precisley, which was funny to watch.Great bar service, very buzzy and certainly worth a visit
5
We were recommended to go to Ku De Ta over the skypark, for the price of two drinks you get the same views as the $20 per person Skypark and you get a couple of drinks. The views were superb and the service was decent too
4
This place is worth booking just for th view and the trendy ambiance. The food and service are ok but nothing really special.
4
The place is manned by mostly friendly Filipinos. Try the steaks, they're superb.
Budget would be US$80 to 100 per person to have as good experience
5
Really top quality food and wine. Great atmosphere with an outstanding view of Singapore. Made for a special night out. It can get a little hectic and crowded.
4
I was visiting Singapore and my friend told me to go to Ku De Ta instead of going up and pay 20$ to Sky Park for the same view with better value for money. He couldn't be more right.If you wanna see the infinity pool upstairs of marina bay sands and the view from it,Ku De Ta offers same view with a drink in your hand for cheaper then the Sky Park entry for 20$.I went there from breakfast if not they seem to have nice satays etc. I strongly reccomend this olace to have a beer and some food and watch the amazing view of Singapore skyline
5
We visited the sky bar restaurant for the first time and we were so impressed with service and the food, from the time we walked in we were taken to our table, we had a lovely Host who greeted us and took us through the menu and wine list, the food arrived the wait staff described in detail about the dishes, the host was so attentive the whole time we were there, the food was sensational compliments to the chef! Overall this had to be the best and memorable experience we all ever had and I definitely recommend this to anyone who has not been there.Well done to the floor staff and chefs
5
My friends and I had a wonderful night at Ku De Ta lats Monday.The breath- taking view as you come out of the elevators is incomparable to anywhere in the world.Its a sweeping view of Singapore CBD, port and high rise hotels.We were greeted by friendly staff and escorted to a sensational table overlooking the harbour.We had a delicious meal of seafood including scallops that tasted like Heaven.Dessert was shared and included Wasabi ice-cream.Im not a fan of wasabi, but this was a taste sensation. A platter of fruit included exotic dragon fruit, Kiwifruit and melons. Attentive and friendly staff complimented a truly incredible night
4
The cocktails were delicious although a bit pricey. For the view/location and the unique blends you don't mind paying a bit more though.The service was pretty impersonal at first but I guess with the amount of noisy people coming in just to take a photo versus real customers it would be hard to pick out an actual customer. Once I managed to snake a seat - they are hard to get. I received table service from the lovely staff who were happy to give you suggestions on which cocktails to get. To be clear I only went for cocktails in the upstairs section not in the restaurant. The food I did see looked very scrumptious though
5
Visited this Restaurant on a Friday night with several business associates. Getting up to the 57th floor was a breeze with efficient check-in on the ground floor. The venue is fantastic, be sure to go to the bar for a drink before or after dinner. The bar had the best views across Singapore. Service was very good, lots of staff and very attentive, dinner was good but not great...missing something special, almost like they brought the food in from the local casino cafe. Serving portions were ample and was tasty but lacked the WOW factor. As is the case in most Singaporean expensive venues, the wine list is great and priced accordingly. A must do place to eat
5
Went there last week....excellent atmosphere and excellent service....I love long island tea....had my best ever long island tea done by Mr.Fredrick one of the bartender there with excellent customer service and friendly experience provided by him....I suggest everyone to go there and try his long island tea....super
1
Firstly the Matradee of this place was a great woman, i didnt get her name but she was very friendly and looked after me well as i was there alone, very professional and had good advice on the area, whatever they are paying her they should double it.As for the food. Well very dissapointing. I ordered the Roasted Salmon, expecting it should come with some rice or vegetable? oh no they said...it comes alone...just fish on a plate for $30...i need to order the other stuff...So ok i got the mushrooms, thats another $12..bottle of water, $12 which is all FINE..apart from when it comes out and u see its this tiny little nemo fish which tasted very average...and mushroom i could have done better myself and i burn everything in the kitchen even the water.I know you pay for the view, but from where i was sitting there was no view either. I love there being a place to eat up there, the roof is an AMZAZING look-out over singapore well worth the trip up, but they really need to change chefs and redo the food because i dont mind paying but i want quality for it. As i said in KU DE TA the only saving grace was the Matradee
5
Well worth treating yourself to going here if you are in Singapore - the food is amazing (yes portions are a little small but the taste is great!), the service is brilliant and the view is priceless.
5
i made dinner reservations online, which were promptly accommodated by their staff. the restaurant was accessible via an elevator at the far end of the hotel. we got a nice table by the window. the atmosphere in the restaurant was animated but it wasn't noisy, which i greatly appreciated. the staff were friendly and polite.the food was very good, and the servings were filling. i was especially pleased with the mushrooms in brown butter -- it was decadent and perfectly seasoned.after dinner, we had a nice stroll along the deck. it was hard to find a spot to enjoy the view because most tables outside were occupied, and a section was closed because some people were filming a movie. but we lucked out on a empty table overlooking the gardens by the bay, and it was truly breathtaking. dinner and drinks for 3 people came out around S$190, and we didn't have to pay the entrance fee to the skypark
3
This place probably has the most privileged view in Singapore but I cannot understand why they made it so small. If you go to the lounge bar for drinks you'll find out that every single table has been taken even if you go there really early. In addition it does not have a distinct atmosphere to make you want to stay long.From the bar you can also have a clear view of the infinity pool which is very impressive
5
It's hard to go past KDT for providing visitors with that 'wow' factor. The view does most of it and they create a great atmosphere. My favorite dishes would be the salt and pepper squid (on my top 10 for Singapore food) and the lamb. We usually get several desserts to share and end up fighting over them
4
We visited this uncontournable place and we were lucky to read review on internet before we go. Check the review of alain 132, it looks like the best tips ever found on trip advisor since i use it. We had some drink in the skybar, wonderfull view, and futhermore at the sunset. Pictures you make can be enlarged and stick on your living room wall (no shame). Also, the infrastructure is amazing from the outside. Staff is trendly, because of the place, but i would suggest you to be carrefull on the bill they give you. For our experience, the bill was allright but we never had the change. According to me, 3 dollars is 3 dollars, and i would prefer to give them as tips whereas to not give me choice
2
Thought that this would be the perfect spot for a business dinner and the location and views are truly stunning. It was a windy evening when we were there. However, the breeze wasn't too much of a problem, but you did have to watch your napkin.The food was disappointing; both in terms of its quality and its quantity. And, of course, it came with the associated expensive price tag.Suggestion: have a drink at the bar, enjoy the view and then move onto one of the many other eateries in Singapore
5
A glass of white wine spritzer cost $29 at the club.....at the restaurant, for a party of 12 and we had 4 dishes of 6 appetizers with champagne or sparkling wine and it worked out to be $130 per head. Nothing to write about the food and the service because there were a mix up on the reservation. The view and ambience made the trip a memorable experience
3
Food and drinks are expensive compared to equivalent elsewhere, but obviously you are paying for the view and the high rent. Food is 'Modern Asian'. Recipes are OK but dishes are lacking finesse in execution. For example, I don't mind seared scallops are are raw in the centre, but they shouldn't be completely raw except for the searing on the outside. My tuna tartare had too much wasabi in it. Sliced duck breast appeared to have been marinaded in an Asian sauce, and was rather ordinary, especially when served with boring old silver beet. The international selection of wines by the glass was good, even if again overpriced. Service was very good, and was actually the best part of the dining experience.
4
We only visited the bar area which was still well worth the visit for the amazing views of Singapore at night. Cocktails fairly pricey but good quality ingredients and a million dollar view make them worth it :) the only downside was not being able to settle in and just have drinks, you had to have dinner and it was completely booked out so I suggest booking if you want to eat there. Make sure you wear nice clothes if going into the restaurant or bar as its fresh, modern and upmarket. Definitely put it on your to do list and go at night
4
My wife and I had a great evening here, very atmospheric, fantastic view and great food. There is a level of turist attraction about it but with that said, it definately is one of the more mind-blowing types which felt a bit like Dubai meets New York. We had read a bit about the service and food etc. but can only say that none of those negative experiences matched ours. Yes it is a bit pricy but nothing unusual for this type of place, if you have tried same category other places in the world. Can definately be recommended as an experience when visiting Singapore
5
great location , food to die for , great service , thouroughly recommended , especially at night , a little bit pricey but worth it
4
Enjoyed the view and the food was delicious (but not outstanding). One thing I found odd was that they wouldn't allow us to order any snack type of food while we had drinks at the bar and waited to be seated. And they were quite intractable on the point. Customer service was deferential yet seemingly arbitrary with regards to what 'service' means. However, all in all a great night was had by all and I would definitely go again
5
We ate here in May 2011. This is an amazing restaurant. Make a reservation in advance- it is essential. We went for dinner. Check the menu online. Sangria and also Apple and Ginger Martinis amazing. Pork belly amongst other foods all superb. If you like too restaurants and great food, you wont be disappointed
5
This restaurant is located on the top floor of the marina sands building, overlooking Singapour. The view is absolutely spectacular ! This open air restaurant offers also very good Asian foods and value for money is good. It's a mustif you are staying in Singapour. Reservation is required. Try to arrive early and spend some time visiting the bar of this amazing 200 meters long roof terrace
5
Went here for dinner on my husband's birthday. have to say I do not agree with people wo say this place is pricey. Its not cheap, we spent an average of $90 a head including a carafe of sake, but thats what you expect to pay in Singapore these days in a high-end restaurant. The food was very good, delicately done seafood & very well presented. The service was outstanding. Our server that night was a young man named Sarvanan & he was pleasant, attentive & knowledgeable, could not have asked for more.After dinner some friends joined us & we moved out to the skybar & I have to say the drinks their are a little on the expensive side, but I guess you are also paying for the amazing night views.All in all a lovely experience & we would certainly go back
3
A great place to impress, with an outstanding view and a good place to be seen. But after 3 visits (a dinner, a business lunch, and a private party event), a distinct sense that it is more flash than substance and a wasted opportunity for what could be outstanding. High points: the view, especially at night time; an over-the-top but memorably delicious wagyu beef and foie gras canape at the private party. Low points: they're busy, popular, and *in*, so service does suffer a bit and you may have trouble getting a good table even for lunch; the food in general is not bad, but you can get miles better at some of Singapore's really top restaurants.Bottom line - if someone invites you there, go. If you're doing the inviting, it's good if you want to impress and go for a safe "I value you so I pulled out all the stops for you" destination, or if you want to be able to tell your friends that you went - but it's not worth it if you like seeking out really good quality or good value for money. A shame, since this could be the place for a really top restaurant, but this isn't it
5
A group of us decided to spend the afternoon at the new "Garden by the Bay" attraction in Singapore and, feeling somewhat tired at the end of the afternoon, we thought we would find a good restaurant. We decided on the Ku de Ta (which is nearby) and what a great decision we made! The view out over Singapore was breathtaking and we were there for sunset, which was spellbinding. The service at the restaurant was impeccable and the wine fantastic. The manager stopped by our table to chat to us and he was charming and made us feel completely welcome. This turned out to be one of the highlights of our recent Singapore holiday. I thoroughly recommend it
4
I was taken to Ku De Ta for a business lunch and it was like accessing a high security area which was a bit over the top for a restaurant! The venue is great and the views stunning which was my primary reason to go there. The service was average and the food was some strange fusion affair and not something I would seek out. In my opinion it is much overplayed
5
We visited the ku de ta bar,and was served by a very frendly and profesional bartender named Ninthe. He treated us like like royalty. We enjoyed it so much so we returned the Next day, and was lucky enough to be greeted by Ninthe who rememberd us. We had an other fantastic evening.Thank you Ninthe Regards, Petter Li
3
After being an avid supporter of the property in Bali, whilst we were in Singapore it was on the to do.After reading the reviews I was somewhat concerned as this was not the Ku de Ta that I knew.The views are amazing, granted but expected.Food was ok but for the price the value lacked. A customers expectation is built for a delivery that is falling short. We ordered the Duck and lamb. We both were looking for dessert but there was nothing on offer to enticeService was somewhat lacking with staff numbers present but productivity wasnt to match. We were often looking for staff to order food and drinks on several occasions.Unfortunately I would have to agree with the majority. Great view. Food average therefore lacking value and on my next visit it will be drinks only.Shame, it's not the Ku de Ta I know!!
3
If you are not too particular about food but the ambience, then this is the place to be :) The view is absolutely stunning and service is really good. The staff there are pretty friendly and accommodating.
3
The view is fabulous, especially if around the bar area. The food is strictly average, at fine-dining prices. Drinks are nothing memorable either. Good buzz on friday and saturday nights. Only recommended for a couple of drinks and view and people watching.
4
High atop an amazing building you feel like you are flying - and that's before you sip you first glass of champagne. Go for the weekend brunch - superb value. Book ahead
5
Went to MBS Ku De Ta to celebrate a friend birthday. Great service, we were wearing black and napkin was change by attentive server to black, this according to server to prevent lint sticking on our black dress. How thoughtful ! The food is fusion of Asian n western. Bit expensive and small portion. We were told to order rice in case. About $70 per pax but the view would have cost $20 so it's really good value
5
Actually, the food is not bad and amazing my taste. As the view is wonderful and so amazing like it as the price average. You pay the wine belong 50 Singapore dollars but the choice is large and judicious. I like the elegance and on this Bar, restaurant you ll find the top in Singapour. Your partnaire will be impressive. The pastry surprise me a lot because the quality is french style and so delicious. Very good mention for that and I recommend it for the tea time
1
BEWARE if you book a restaurant table and it rains, they give your table away to people seated outside!! A great way to be treated for my 30th birthday celebration.  We were told to wait 30-60mins at the bar.  Only after 5 minutes of persistent arguing did they offer to seat as at another restaurant in Marina Bay Sands
3
The view from this place is great. Go there at sunset to make the best out of it. The bar is an expensive venue. Be prepared to pay more than 40 singapore dollars for two 50 cl. Stella Artois, just to give you an example. If you need more insight google the place, on its internet site the full menu is available. Service was ok. Around midnight the place tends to be packed. There a small dance floor, not much frequented. The music was quite enjoyable. Access is from the base of tower 3 of Marina Bay Sand hotel. After 6 pm. A dress code (smart casual) is enforced. P.s. make sure you do not leave any personal belonging unattended. Things do disappear. Enjo
3
Went there as a group of 4 on a Monday night around 10:00 p.m., it was really packed even it wasn't weekend. The drink was ok, nothing special, the service was just fair, the view from the bar was the selling point of the place.If you want to get an indoor seat, keep in mind about the dressing code. It requires smart casual. No flip flop and beach shorts. Otherwise, you can enjoy the outdoor breeze and view but only stand-up bar, no seats available
5
If you can get a table here, the experience is really outstanding. Perched on the top of Sands Bay with view across downtown, the Flyer and beyond. The food was very good indeed (duck, steak, tempura vegetable) and staff were anxious to ensure our total satisfaction. The wine list was extensive and of high quality. This is not, as you would expect, a cheap place to eat but for a special occasion it more than delivers. Access to the roof venue is quite a struggle at peak times with all the regular sightseers..so persist. It has to be one the best places in Singapore to eat
3
I visited the restaurant, on business. Go to say you've been there. Food is ok, wine selection ample and overpriced but the view of Singapore is amazing. Your clients and guests will be impressed. It has a resort feeling to it that leaves it lacking elegance and sophistication. The bar is one of the hot spots of the city and a "see and be seen" spot
5
It's one of the best restaurants where i've been. Wonderful staff and delicious food! If you're in Singapore go there for an awesome meal!
5
great menue, very recommendable are the raw snapper with fresh truffle, tuna tartar, japanese beaf rolls, the new zealand venison, japanese pinneaple soup as dessert,
very friendly and attentiv service personel, amazing view over singapore, cool and relaxing atmosphere
5
The best place around, you can have food drinks and also have a nice view
INSTEAD OF PAYING for skypark, better go to kudeta and enjoy the food, or drink and the view
also nice music
4
Only take your mother in law if she earned it. Superb views and great atmosphere, but quite expensive. Very professional waiters. Good choice for business dinners to impress.
3
This place has an amazing vibe, amazing view, but the food was terrible & veryyyyy expensive.. I went there on my honeymoon it was the most expensive place we ate at & the worst dinner we had.. I recommend going there just for a drink.
5
Had excellent food overlooking Singapore from the 57 th floor of Marina Bay Sands hotel. A must visit!!
1
We booked KuDeTa Singapore for 4 for an evening in mid July 2012. If you expect dining you will be dissappointed. The place was very noisy with people milling around everywhere. The location is definitely amazing except that this restaurant does not actually know what it wants to be. A popular hangout for masses of people or a great fine dining experience. The final result is you get a little bit of both. The food was mediocre with presentation being below average. The prices, however, are defintely well and truly above avergae. The total bill for the 4 of us was just under $500.00. We were told when booking that the dress code was smart casual. However, we saw men with shorts and thongs going through the restaurant. You need to stand to see the view from inside the restaurant as you need to see over the heads of hundreds of people only metres in front of you (non restaurant patrons) wanting the watch Singapore from the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino. My recommendation is to go here for a drink and/or order a simple cheap item in the menu and stay for as long as you can to enjoy the atmosphere. Fine dining is defintely not to be had here
2
Went with a group of 8, some got the $150 tasting meal, almost nothing for vegetarians, the rest tried a variety if menu items. Food was all around mediocre. Don't waste your money on tasting menu, in fact don't go at all. Go up to the bar, have a drink and enjoy the amazing view. Staff were less than helpful. Food was over or under cooked, vegetables seemed to have been cooked earlier and then just reheated for service. Nothing out of the ordinary about anything on menu except prices.If you want an amazing $150 tasting dinner that will leave a craving in your soul for more the rest of your life go to Megu in Tribeca (not the one at United Nations) in New York City
3
Make no bones about it, this is a fantastic location with tremendous views and food. The food is a "modern Asian" type - a combination of Japanese, Chinese and other tastes, but excellent. The wine is horrendously overpriced and the service does not justify food prices. We were sharing dishes between 5 of us and for every single dish we had to flag down a waiter to ask for a serving spoon. In addition to the, the mass of staff showing people to their tables cannot and will not help you with anything, just point you to a waiter. We enjoyed the food, it was great, the views were great, but I wouldn't rush back

My 1st visit at the invitation of a good friend. I was like Wow! What a view! What an experience! Everything about Ku De Ta reeks expensive including the menu so you would think it will be delightful. Well, service was good. Food was overpriced and not worth it, does the chef know? 6 friends and $800 bucks lighter, next time we'll just get drinks.

ok, KuDeTa- pretty standard. But you can beat the marina bay sands skypark charge of $20 by going up here instead- Free entry in daytime and great views and picture opportunity.. same as skypark for views!

Bit pretentious - dress code at a (mostly) open-air restaurant 50 stories up...really??Menu Japanese-inspired and v. expensive. Food, however, very good. But guys, it's Singapore - even at this altitude, a bottle of water gets warm in 10 minutes - ice bucket or jacket, please. Oh, and if you could just pitch the music volume such that I don't have to shout across a 2ft table, that would be nice, too

How good is this place?Perched atop the Marina Bay development, 50 floors high, an open air restaurant with the best views in Singapore serving beautiful modern Asian fusion food along with some very funky lounge music.We didn't understand what anything was so we went for the taster menu which was absolutely superb. I still don't know what we ate but I'd definitely do it again. It's very expensive and very busy so you definitely need to book in advance but it's worth every penny. I have to say that I'm not an expert on Asian food and a lot of reviewers have said that the food was not so good. It may be that we hit on a good night or my untrained taste buds need a little education but I loved every single mouthful

Well what can I say.....this is truly the worst food experience I have had in such a long time which is a terrible shame given that the location and view is just so incredible.We ordered the soft shell crab (can only imagine McDonalds fries are greasier), the eggplant (dripping in grease took one bite and sent it back), sweet potatoes (so greasy and flavourless I could not eat them) Black Miso Cod (usually one of my favourite dishes in Nobu or other good Japanese restaurants ´- overdone, miso sauce not existent, was completely dry and inedible). The only good thing about this meal was my husband's beef which was pefectly done and quite lovely.Even my sorbet for dessert was quite average.They completely messed up our order too, bringing the wrong drinks at the start of dinner, and then forgetting my green tea with dessert.We told them we were not paying for the food we sent back and they offered to give is free dessert instead of a refund which I thought was really bad customer care in a restaurant charging these prices. It was clear we hadn't eaten much of the things we sent back, so not sure why they thought we should pay for this greasy canteen food! We wouldn't have eaten any had we not been so hungry!Worst of all, my tummy hurt for about 24 hours afterwards and my husbands too, from the grease overload. Service extremely average for a place charging these prices.If I were you, I would eat somewhere else then come for a glass of champagne and dessert because the view is absolutely incredible.Unless you like McDonalds of course? Then the grease overload is probably perfect for you

We came to Ku De Ta to celebrate my birthday and it was an amazing experience. You get a 360 view of the city which was impeccable. Our waiter Leonard was especially great. He treated us well and was very friendly. The food was good, but not the best. However, the drinks were top notch and the ambiance is why you come here
3
Visited KU DE TA to get a feel for Marina Bay Sands hotel complex, the massive development that is the centerpiece of the waterfront development in Singapore. Once you weave through the high end stores and curious gondola canal inside the mall at the base of the complex, you glide up 57 floors to a spectacular view of the Singapore skyline and waterfront. It is a sight to behold and enjoying a cocktail standing along the rail and taking in the view is one of the great vista bar experiences in the world. The tropical night bathes you in warmth with a gentle breeze, the lights of Singapore glisten, and all is good with the world, even if the drinks come with the usual stiff Singapore cost. My advice is stop with that and skip the rest. Dinner at KDT is a largely forgettable and overpriced experience. The service is businesslike and sterile, efficient and lacking in any personal connection like a smile. It is a transaction. The food is ok, but not worth the costs. We were seated outdoors and you couldn't see the view given the plants and angles, so you might as well have been seated in an outdoor restaurant 57 floors lower. We had a group of 7 and with two bottles of wine the bill came to about $850 Sing dollars. In the end we were glad to have experienced the view, but could have taken the money on dinner and enjoyed it much more at one of the many great Singaporean restaurants. The challenge of a location restaurant like this is that the view is the star, and everything else seems to fade into the background.Make the climb to the top for sure, and then get out before sitting down to dine

Our last night in Singapore and we decided to spend it at Ku De Ta… we were not disappointed. The drink on the deck when we arrived, our window seat in the restaurant looking over those still mingling on the deck to the view beyond, the attentive service and the fabulous food! I can't fault this! We enjoyed the degustation menu and it was perfect. Each course was exactly as it was described, and each a taste sensation. We have eaten in many places around the world and this was definitely up there with many other meals of a similar calibre. The key is to savour each mouthful, take your time, enjoy the flavours and the time out. This is not a meal to rush! We will definitely be back on our next visit

Everyone writes about the view.....that's a given. Everyone writes about the price....anyone had dinner in the Eiffel Tower ? ...you are not here (or there) because you are cheap.The food is nicely done and the 'sharing' theme makes for fun with friends. The ambiance is great and the environmental quality excellent. An enjoyable experience
2
I should have listened to the negative reviews. Yeah, the view was pretty cool, but we could have easily paid $25 per drink and sat at the bar rather than paying $250 for a subpar meal. Seated inside, you don't even have a view - all you can see is the crowd of tourists standing outside. I appreciate good food and don't mind paying for it. But when you order 5 dishes and have to stick a frozen pizza in the oven when you get home because your husband is still hungry, you have a problem. The only thing worth having was the crispy sticky squid. My husband's lamb was not served medium rare - it was well done and extremely tough. The salmon sashimi was not raw as stated on the menu - it was torched and had zero flavor. Our four stalks of asparagus were nothing to write home about, nor was the fragrant rice.Like I said, go sit at the bar and have a drink. It normally costs $20 to enter the Skywalk, but if you say you're going to the bar it's free. The food is just not good! I promise!!

Ku De Ta Restraunt is tucked away very high up on a tall building with fantastic surroundings. The restraunt management takes this fact into account when ripping off their customers with very high Singapore dollar numbers. Food is not that great here although one would expect much better tasting food based on bill sizes. Being in Singapore and giving this place a miss will be a very good idea. Take it from me as I was inflicted badly here with poor service, lousy tasting food and arrogant approach by a staff member who felt booking for reservation here is an entitlement only reserved for the royal family members of the world. This place is a big mistake for a commoner like me and many of you common folk. Period
2
We went for sunday brunch. I'm used to big brunches with free flow mimosas etc (see my review form equinox ) so this one was a disappointment. You have a very basic buffett and a limited a la carte dishes that come in tinny sizes. The place per se is very nice with the great view form MBS, but don't expect to be allowed to walk the gardens, for that you need to pay extra
4
Ku De Ta has a great location to start with. The views are spectacular.We arrived early for our booking so had a drink at the Sky Bar which is open to the public and next door to the restaurant. At the 57th level the views are amazing. Only issue is that this can be a bit crowded but it's a fun place to visit.The restaurant has several levels so most tables have some view. Service is very efficient and helpful. The waiter we had was prepared, when asked, to tell us which were her favourite courses. Generally we find waiting staff reluctant to commit.The sommelier was particularly helpful in advising on a suitable wine to suit our meals.Our meals were delivered efficiently and we rated the food highly. We would return to this restauran

The experience at Ku De Ta is undoubtably enhanced by wonderful expansive views to all quarters of Singapore and I am sure this is a major reason why so many choose to dine here. It is over 50 floors up and spans from the reclamation and harbour areas to the Singapore River, the commercial heart of the city and the expansive CBD beyond to the immediate suburbs. The restaurant is higher than the Singapore Eye but not the highest in the city. The Singapore cityscape in all of Asia presents a vast panorama of the newness, affluence, non-stop construction and progress. The vista presented defies any sense of a world-wide recession. The Marina Sands is one of the newest hotel complexes and Singaporeans (and others it seems) continue to be seduced by the newest and the trendiest, but great dining is surely about service and food so is more than about the newest restaurant. Beyond the renowned views at Ku De Ta the experience is variable; perhaps this reflects extremely variable reviews and guest experiences, and the restaurant management will need to quickly realise this as other large hotels appear and the trend to move on to the newest restaurant prevails. There is no service consistency, which is a training issue, and there needs to be an awareness of this as such and be addressed. So Trip Advisor members be conscious of this if you chose this restaurant. Seek to book either an outside table (if you cope with the heat) or a 'beside the window' inside table for the views. We booked, arrived right on time and they provided the table requested. However, there was pressure to unnecessarily wait and drink at the bar before we were seated. Be polite but firm with the staff. The components of service epitomised the variability. The front of house was disorganised with no one in charge, the attitude was aloof almost to the point of wanting to convey exclusiveness and disengagement. If you have decided and then booked to dine here you do not need to face this attitude upon arrival. It is hard enough negotiating the maze that is the Marina Sands to their restaurant reception, the lift system and then to strike aloofness entering the restaurant is too much. The front desk service does not compare in any way with the gracious table service. Once seated we had excellent service from the waiting staff. These staff members are the strength of this restaurant, along with the chefs. The dining experience is significantly about sharing, an admirable feature, a vast array of small plates with the expected Asian fusion emphasis is offered, and there is quality presentation in the plating. Our experience with the food served was very good. We enjoyed a range of small plates and most were of excellent standard. The vegetable stack dishes with caviar and the delicious salads with fresh Asian greens and dressings were exceptional. The fresh raw tuna was a memorable dish and the squid, beef, and glazed chicken plates were enjoyed. Of note were the desserts which were exquisite and impressively presented. Several plates, however, were very small in comparison with others for no apparent reason. When asked the waiting staff were uncertain. We enjoyed the quality of the food. The prices for some plates are reasonable (there are some excessively expensive options available too) but overall the dining price per head is expensive and value is questionable - it was over $(S) 90 each and the wine list is expensive. You clearly pay for the views. With a total bill for two in excess of $(S) 275 I did not expect to have a difficulty with a surly and totally ungracious cashier, exercising her unwarranted seniority, which clearly embarrassed the more junior waiting staff. To the restaurant's credit when I wrote later to question their policy excuse, explain they had made a mistake and to complain about this embarrassment for all concerned the management responded appropriately (about training) with reassurances that I should ask for and be welcomed by the manager if I ever dined there again !Beyond the restaurant itself there are all manner of restrictions. To roam beyond the immediate confines of the restaurant's viewing deck is impossible. There is a lack of service ethic with the hotel security staff's approach to restricting access across the top floor and even at the ground floor reception. If you are dining you could expect civility. The approach of channeling restaurant guests out the very moment you have paid a most significant bill presented a sour final impression. I would return to dine at Ku De Ta but would not tolerate the variability in servic

I went with my wife on our Anniversary hoping for a nice evening. I have to admit the view was splendid but the level of service was horrible. We ordered some starters and a main course expecting something worth our money. One of the dishes I remember was basically a few chicken strips cooked in some soy sauce which was way too salty. The desserts were nice though but nothing compared to other dessert places like Jaan or 2am dessert bar. What was a complete turn off was the service, well particularly from one waiter who was loud and spoke to us like it was some coffeeshop. We suspect he was drunk because he was actually shouting across to the other waiters and cracking jokes like as though he owned the place! What's more, when we were almost done with our wine, he came up to us and asked us in a rude tone 'finished already?' like as though he wanted us to leave. I think he backed off after I gave him a dirty look. I will NEVER go there again..

I had booked a one night stay at the Marina Bay Sands and decided to spash out on dinner at this restaurant.We had a table indoors which meant we really had no views. You actually had to get up and go outside to see the skyline.The dinner offering at Ku De Ta is all based on sharing. So whilst my wife and I ordered separate entries they were automatically placed in the centre of the table for us to share. We had each ordered a steak as a main plus some accompanying vegetables. The steaks arrived already cut in strips to allow you to et with chopsticks. Whilst this was a surprise it was really quite a nice way to enjoy what was an excellent and flavorsome meal. What stood out on the night was the excellent service. As we finessed our entry we were asked if we wanted our main course straight away or wished to wait a while. There was always somewhere nearby topping up our water or asking how our meal was. very attentive service.If you want a restaurant for the view there are better on offer in singapore. This restaurant was a very enjoyable experience and convenient given we were staying in the hotel. Be prepared though, the meals are quite expensive

Went over with my colleagues for after office chill out session. The place is indeed nice to relax and unwind after a busy work day. Nice place with an average view. The food was not that great either but the drinks were okay. They have a good variety of drinks.The staff was friendly and welcoming. They were friendly and were very helpful. I would not say anything much about the food as it was not to my expectation. We had ordered some snacks to have with our drinks but all of us were not please with the dish. This is my first time here and i personally find it to be a good place to go with friend for a chill out session. We did not spend too much time there. Thus, i cant say anything more for now. If i do visit this Bar again in the future, i shall definitely update the details... Cheers!

I liked their Asian fusion menu - we ordered a mix of viands - from prawns to chicken and beef - and all tasted very good! We had singapore sling (which tasted quite different than the ones I have in Manila) but my kids liked it. The ambience and the view were all terrific and breathtaking. Average spend is S$80 per person. Need to reserve ahead of time, especially, if you prefer to be seated in the airconditioned section. But, we preferred to have dinner al fresco - great idea because we soaked in the view and the warm, pleasant breeze (at 57th floors above street level)

OMG....what an overpriced, lack lustre spread this was. Twenty fun loving ladies there to celebrate a friends forthcoming wedding. We had heaps of fun but food and service are sadly lacking. I have never experienced at such a high priced restaurant such mediocre food. We were here for brunch and both the food served to the table and ordered off the menu were sub standard. Stale waffles, tastless thai fried rice which was also oily and not seasoned, grey fatty pieces of chicken in the thai green curry, 3 tiny pieces of vegetable tempura!! Come on Ku de Ta!!! You are at the top of the world renowned Marina Bay Sands....get your act together. How dare you serve such poor food at such inflated prices!! Great fun with the girls but will never ever go back to this restaurant to eat..
4
without doubt the food quality is excellent, although we were unable to partake of dessert, which by other reveiws sounds even better. Wait staff attentive, wine list expensive. The veiw is limited by plants and the club bar. The number of people wandering around the veiwing deck is very off putting.Frontline staff were less than welcoming, the confusion of where we could sit (I felt more to the fact was IF we could sit). We booked a table prior to our visit but this did not guarantee a table, interesting concept!Overall we enjoyed the evening, the food being the best aspect

KuDeTa @ Marina Bay Sands overlooks the entire CBD. The view is so beautiful. If you are a traveler - you will surely go back with some beautiful pictures. If you are a local - it takes away all your stress and strain. You can view the entire skyline of pretty little Singapore from here. Also the Merlion, Esplanade and the stadium. It is a must visit for everyone.To Note-* entry on every night but friday and Saturday is free. * the drinks are quite expensive. Their wine menu is quite extensive though!* you cant jump into the infinity pool if you visit Kundeta. Only if you are a hotel guest, you can take a dip there.*music is awesome. They have a dance floor wide open. It's jampacked on Saturdays!*if you aren't interested in the clubbing scene, just visit on weekdays (except friday) and chill out. Go early else I won't get a table by the rooftop

ok if you are going to go here, go for dessert or snacks. it's too expensive to eat dinner - especially in terms of what they offer. the apple crumble granita is to die for.
5
Dined at Ku De Ta restaurant on top of Marina Bay Sands hotel and Sky Park, views of Singapore are fantastic, especially at night.
3
Yes - the view is amazing and breathtaking. But don't expect any good food. It's very basic especially for the brunch. The staff is relatively kind but not up to Singapore's standards.In short I recommend this place to anyone not having great expectations as to the quality of the food but willing to enjoy a fantastic view over the bay

After my review in April, I have given Ku De Ta another go round. Although I gave them a good overall review last time because of the quality of food and table service, my review had some negatives as well and I must admit that I was contacted my management within 24 hours of the review being posted. They were professional and inquisitive about how to serve better so hats off to them. We returned for my daughter’s birthday and it was obvious that the staff had been drilled to ensure good service because of the review. Three of them actually mentioned the negative review, which was a bit odd, but oh well, they were prepared. As last time, the quality of the food was terrific and the wait staff wonderful. The overall experience was very good and many thanks for the comp-ing our total alcohol bill for the headaches described in my last review. Only real negative was that we showed up 10 minutes early so they asked us my wife, daughter and I to have a drink at the nightclub portion while they prepared the table. Once we walked across, we were told we couldn’t enter because it was a nightclub and our daughter was with us. After some icy stares and a few minutes of discussion between staff on where we should go, we were allowed in. As pointed out in other reviews, the front staff isn’t always the most user-friendly. They’re going for an exclusive vibe but it does come off as pretentious without the effort level to back it up. It’s hard to put an overall rating on Ku De Ta and I see that the opinions are all over the place on TripAdvisor. I’d say the most accurate is “Great food & wine list, terrific table staff, odd atmosphere and a front staff that can be pretty smug unless you’re on their good side”. On the other obvious factors……Is it the best food in Singapore? It’s near the top of the list, yes. Is it the best view in Singapore? No. Good view but nothing earth-shattering if you’ve been up in tall buildings before. Is it tops for romantic dinner? No. Tables are strange. Very high and wide to ensure you’re kept apart and the noise level is very high. Plus there is a path around the restaurant at a slightly lower level to the tables so you sort of feel like Polar Bears in a zoo with legions of people walking around you at all times. I would say it’s a top place to take business guests and visitors to Singapore to impress

I had high hopes for this restaurant (no pun intended) for this restaurant in the Sky Garden in Singapore's Sands hotel. However I was pretty disappointed. Service was OK, not very attentive but they were busy so you need to cut them a bit of slack. Menu looked interesting but the food was actually quite bland. The view is amazing but they need to increase the height of the barriers around the restaurant as when the wind blows up there you can end up with your salad in your lap, which happened to me!Worth a visit? Well I'm not going out of my way to go back lets put it like that
5
This restaurant was better than even we expected. We booked for 6.30 and were able to take in the view by daylight and then the evening lights. We arrived a little early and ordered drinks which we were able to take out to the viewing deck for obligatory scenic photos. Our waitress (trainee Marysan ?) fully explained the concept of shared plates and that they may arrive at intervals. In fact they arrived pretty much all together which was fine by us. We had 5 plates, OMG, the squid, and the prawns and even the vegetables, everything was excellent. We even managed to squeeze in dessert and coffee. Yes it was a little bit pricey ($180 )although we thought it would cost more, but drinks were nearly 1/2 the cost and we only had 3! This was a very well run restaurant and all staff were friendly and efficient. After dinner we enjoyed the night lights and then were lucky enough to catch the music and laser show from the Casino below. I would recommend it for overall package of food, views and service
5
The food was amazing - especially the teriyaki chicken. Service was outstanding and I loved that there was such an extensive champagne list. The evening was on the expensive side however we felt that the quality of both the food and the service justified this.I am terrified of heights so I stayed close to the wall, however my partner enjoyed the views over Singapore
5
WOW!! aside from the amazing view, food was great! Kudeta restaurant staff were very friendly and accommodating. This restaurant is really classy in everything! I love everything about Kudeta Restaurant! Very clean, a place for expats. You'll feel the warm hospitality from the lobby up to the 57th floor. The best restaurant i've ever been
4
My husband decided to book a table at Ku De Ta for my birthday. We had a lovely night out: the food was incredible; the champagne delicious and the staff were extremely friendly! Our waiter organized a scrumptious chocolate pudding with ice cream which came on a plate saying Happy Birthday piped in chocolate - a lovely surprise! The setting and ambience was perfect for a romantic celebration. The only reason I haven't rated it excellent is because of the price - we'll definitely go back but not regularly
4
I've had the chance to organize a management meeting involving VVIP and when I put these across the service management. They really take it seriously and hence, my guest left the place with a full belly and great memories.Just read through a few comments in here and realised that there a few bad encounters but I'm very contented with the service I had
4
We did the tasting menu which included a great mix of flavours and textures. Delicious and a fun dining experience. Would recommend it.

I brought my 60+yr old parents and 80+ yr old grandmother to the Skybar/Restaurant, thinking that it will be an opportunity for them to finally experience the view of Singapore from there for the first time. This was also a pre-Mother's Day treat for my mother and grandmother.However, I was very disappointed with my encounter with the restaurant staff.The hostess at the entrance was patronising and rude. There were no signs to indicate that guests with a restaurant pass shld head directly to the restaurant. This was brought to my attention when the hostess, in a patronising tone, told me that we shld go to the restaurant, “or else pay $20 for the Skypark tickets”. My grandmother is physically crippled by multiple hip surgeries and had wondered off with the help of my mother to admire the view. I got my sisters to go to the restaurant first but the hostess haughtily said "what abt the rest of them?". This was outrageous, extremely nasty and inconsiderate. It made my parents and grandmother sound like a herd of cows. I pointed out to her that my grandmother cannot walk well at all and cannot rush to the restaurant the minute she commanded us to do so.When we finally got to the open restaurant/bar area, we were told that there are no seats and we shld stand by the bistro tables. This is not possible for my grandmother. By this time, we were also feeling very unwelcome. My grandmother and mother were literally 'blocked' with outstretched arms by a couple of the waiting staff when they walked towards one of the corner tables thinking that they can perhaps sit there. Most customers would have been understanding if they are pointed politely to the policies governing where guests should go or not. In this instance, Kudeta staff are ill-trained, rude, and condescending towards customers who are not perhaps their standard guest profile.It breaks broke heart to see the disappointed looks on my parents and grandmother’s faces. We had walked a long way from the basement 2 of the Shoppes to the hotel only to spend less than 10 mins up at the establishment. An evening which was meant for them to enjoy the glorious side of Singapore turned out to be one where they saw the extremely unpleasant side, which excluded them from an experience that they are entitled to: have a drink and enjoy the view from the top of a Singapore icon.I wrote a letter to the establishment only to receive an apology from the guest relations manager (without any explanation of what the restaurant policies are) FOUR days later. Not returning again as there are plenty of rooftop restauarant/bars in the area
4
The cocktails to start we're brilliant and the mango dessert was also, everything else was very nice except mayb the soft shell crab was a little below par. The staff are very friendly and attentive. I think it's a good experience as the views are great and the restaurant is lovely but maybe people would argue the food doesn't match the prices. All in all I would go back and enjoyed the night
3
Went to Ku De Ta for our 5 th Anniversary celebration dinner. My husband ordered crab and I ordered some sweet potato dish with rice. Firstly my dish lacked taste and gravy both... I had specifically asked if it comes in a gravy and I was told yes the sauce is like gravy and can be eaten with rice. The quantity of the food is poor and leaves you hungry for more. The crab was good. The bar is nice and has an awesome 360 degree view of Singapore. You can see the esplanade, merlion and the Singapore Flyer with all it's jazzy lights. The bar offers a good variety of drinks and is decently priced. You have to have prior reservation to get to Ku De Ta

Ku De Ta, located at SkyPark at Marina Bay Sands, North Tower1 Bayfront Avenue Singapore 018971 is an elegant (and expensive) restaurant. A friend was coming down to Singapore after a long time and so we thought we'd take her to one of Singapore's newest restaurants, Ku De Ta. The pre-dinner drinks on the Skydeck were excellent. We had a delightful cocktail made with passion fruit and walked on the deck from where we could see the East Coast skyline of Singapore. It was breezy and cheerful reflecting the joyful mood visitors were in. Soon, it was time for dinner and we went into the airconditioned restaurant. Our friend is a world traveller and a gourmet, if you know one. We ordered a soup and for the main course, our friend ordered a fish dish while my husband and I ordered a vegetarian dish from the menu. We had checked earlier whether they catered to vegetarian tastes and they had said yes. However, what was brought to the table was far from what we had expected. One of the dishes was aubergine in a sauce, which besides being miniscule, tasted raw and flavorless. The rest of the meal was very ordinary too. Our friend's fish did not come up to any high standard she had expected from one of Singapore top restaurants. On the whole, for the prices we paid, it was disappointing. Being in a prime location, the restaurant should employ better chefs and make sure the high standards of their sophisticated clientele be met
4
We had booked a table so sat on the outside edge of the restaurant. The view was amazing, we had the 630pm timeslot so got to see the sunset, stunning. We were a group of 7 and shared 8 plates which were nice although not particularly filling. I had a carafe of sangria which was very nice and managed to get 4 glasses out of the carafe for SGD38 which I consider good value. No, it's not something I'd do every weekend but for the experience it was great and I'm glad I did it
4
Had a great meal here, straight off the plane from UK.. Astonishing views, great cocktails. We had the taster menu (recommended by Singapore residents we were with) which was excellent with some interesting and quirky plates. The atmosphere was brilliant and the staff attentive and well trained. Inevitably expensive and not a place you would go every night but definately worth it once during your stay. Pity you cannot go out onto the viewing the terrace - seems ridiculous
2
Having been to so many similar restaurants sadly it has nothing different to offer. Located on top of the Marina Bay Sands you unfortunately loose any real experience if unlikely and seated within the restaurant walls. Staff are most certainly pleasant, attentive and what one would expect in such a venue. The menu is also as one might expect for a high end restaurant ... and that is the problem ... it is what you expect - good quality, highly priced, small portions of 'try hard to be different but just not succeeding' fusion type cuisine
4
The view was amazing but you pay for it with the price of the food and drinks.To get the best view you have to stand at the bar tables along the edge of the building. You can reserve tables at the end near the infinity pool.Great view of the light show that starts at 8.00pm and then again at 9.30pm over the bay. Worth a visit for a drink and the view but too expensive to stay too long
4
The best thing about this place is the view, and having drunk cocktails in some amazing places around the world, the prices here are breathtaking.If you stay on the far side of the skydeck, then you get the breeze and the phenomenal view. Also your ears will remain intact.Go around to the 'Club' and you will be asailed by overly loud music, so much so that it was hard to enjoy my $25 Negroni....which they put soda in. Who ever heard of a negroni made with Soda?Actually, if you go there, stay at the bar on the main deck and dont bother with the club. It sort of took the gloss off the night for me
3
this place has a fabulous view, medicocre food, sky high prices. A good place to take visitors to enjoy the view and have something to eat/drink, instead of paying to do the Skygarden
4
We had drinks at the Marina Bay Ku De Ta, great place with amazing views....just go and experience. But be awre that thye have a dresscode no flip flops are muscle shirts.
5
Had a sunset dinner with family and my sons (9 and 7 years)
Wonderfully attentive staff and a fabulous view.
Great food. Recommend the crispy Squid and the cocktail "Angry Bird"
A must do while on holiday in Singapore

Expensive drinks but then you don't pay admission. Good music- one drink kinda place!
3
Visited the restaurant for a Sunday brunch and the place was busy, with a good crowd on the viewing terraces the surround the restaurant. I wonder if they were all guests of the restaurant? Menu was a strange hodge podge selection of somewhat small 'tasting' portions of things like fresh oysters, steak and eggs, to fried rice and green curry. Didn't bother with the salad and appetizer table and stuck with trying the various hot serves. Pricing range from food only "hmmm.." to "seriously???" with champagne. So, worthwhile if you can consume copious amounts of bubbly but otherwise, probably not on my list of repeats. Too bad really as the pleasant staff and setting could otherwise make for a nice restaurant to bring visitors to enjoy the spectacular views

Don't expect a culinary experience at this outlet.my lunch.included Japanese Thai fusion items such as sushi rolls, udon noodles, vegetarian tempura and steak in teriyaki sauce.overall a pleasant experience, given the unique location and glorious views of the restaurant on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hote

Had brunch. Restaurant is separated by a terrace and viewing platform from the view so it's pretty distant. Cold buffet no better or worse than similar large hotel fare; hot dishes mediocre - red snapper dry and steak hash gloopy. Good service but that's to be expected in Singapore. No wow factor at all - expensive for what it is

Although it tends to be crowded and noisy, KU DE TA delivers a unique experience. Exterior tables are highly recommended for the spectacular atmosphere of the Singapore skyline (but try to avoid tables too central and too close to the bar which tend to be very noisy -prefer tables away from the bar and on the sides). The food matches the setting

For those who have been to Ku de ta in Bali, it has nothing in common. It is not a cool place it is a tourist attraction. Service is bad and staff know as much about wine as an Iranian Mufti. I wanted to order a bottle of white wine and could not get any assistance in choosing on the wine list. During our visit there was a very obnoxious lady analyzing every people getting to the entrance to deliver a verdict of "you can get in" or "cannot" depending on clothing worn. You can look super great and fabulous but you won't get in with beach shoes or flip flops so beware. If you want to enjoy the view of the Sands, get a room in the hotel or simply pay to go to the top floor as a visitor. It is definitely no worth spending any money in this place.There is a big thing going concerning the right of this place to use the ku de ta name, according to the local press one of the Australian owners of the ku de ta in Bali sold the name to the Singaporians without the approbation of his partners. The last I heard about it, the case was about to be brought up in court (to be confirmed).I won't go bac

Ku De Ta is on the rooftop of Marina Bay Sands. It is a great place for a drink in the afternoon or an evening dinner (but don't forget to dress appropriately--no shorts--for evening). Prices are high but what you would expect for a tourist area with a great view. If you want the same view without having to pay for the observation deck head for Level 33 on floor 33 of Marina Bay Financial Center across the way

Enjoyed cocktails by the bar with a cool vibe & views over Singapore. Yes it was pricey at $25 a drink but it was a once only experience!

We dined here last Friday for the second time. The view is amazing and the food was delicious. We choose the set menu given we had a group of 5. The weather was nice enough that we could be seated outside for our meal. Although it was expensive, I would still probably go back as it is a lovely way to spend an evening. When you make your booking, be sure to request a table outside or next to the window inside. And if you want to enjoy the view without the pricetag, make a booking for lunch instead of dinner :

After almost two years, we finally decided to give the place a try and what a dichotomy of experiences. Kudos to the staff and chef, but whoever runs the business side of things needs to pull their head out of their…..you know where. Act 1 – Easy enough to make a reservation and the phone staff was very helpful and friendly. It was for my wife’s birthday and they also proactively offered a cake with her name on it. Good stuff; no worries. Then, starting three days before the evening, I receive daily calls to reconfirm, the last one 15 minutes before the reservation on the day. Now, one is understandable. Two, maybe for a dinner with a President or Royal Family attending, but three??!! You’ve got to be kidding. We’ve been blessed gastronomically and none of the best restaurants in any of the leading cities of the world has even called more than once to reconfirm; and the last time being just minutes before the reservation when they know it’s a birthday celebration. YIKES. This pushed the snob-o-meter meter way passed “pretentious” and well into the “utter dork” category for the business manager. As the staff doing this was all friendly and seemingly well-trained, this makes it the managements’ fault. Yes you got your 15 minutes of fame with all the TV specials about you opening in such a unique location, but get over yourself. Then to top it off, when we arrived (again everyone knowing it was a birthday as we were greeted as such) we were asked if we would be kind enough to vacate the table after 90 minutes. I almost lost it but managed to contain my reaction to a deep lean-into the person informing them that we would leave when we were finished. I would expect more maturity and professionalism from a kindergarten student than to say something like that. Again, to the business side of the operation….a resounding thumbs down!Act 2 – After a brief flash of anger at the “90 minute” remark, we were seated, and boy am I glad I didn’t walk out because of the idiocy to that point. The staff, to a person, was hugely friendly, helpful and with that perfect mix of attentiveness without hovering. The menu is a terrific blend of various tastes and can really satisfy all ranges of preferences. We started with cocktails, and these were superbly mixed. Many compliments to whoever assembled the wine list. Without being gargantuan, it has a wonderful representation of winemaking internationally and has great examples from large and small wine regions internationally. The food was well-prepared and the meats especially were cuts that were by far the best I have ever seen in Singapore. The various dishes were delivered with perfect timing and the interaction of the wait staff was impeccable. Even the birthday cake was to die for. Perfect in every way. For the staff and cuisine – Huge thumbs up! Now with such a newsy place, what else I can say? I suppose I should get specific. It’s not a particularly romantic place as the acoustics ensure that even at 75% or even 50% capacity (again making it seem odd they wanted the table in 90 minutes), the noise level was well above a dull roar. I suppose this can be corrected. Another odd non-romantic aspect is that the tables for two are a slightly off rectangular shapes so that the distance to your loved one/partner is just slightly too far away. The view issue is relative as only a few of the tables actually are in positions to enjoy the skyline. Once you are in the door, however, and are in the hands of the staff, it is a very very wonderful experience. The little things….. drinks’ size, coffee quality, smiles on faces etc are all of a quality that would hit the mark against the best, anywhere in the world. I see that the other ratings are all over the map and I’m not surprised. Once the snob factor gets too big, nobody cares how well you cook and it would be good of the ownership/management to recognize that

Went there with a group of six business colleagues for dinner. Everyone loves the view, the vibe and overall atmosphere. No complaints.The menu is shockingly high priced and the wines 100+ for the cheap stuff. For this level of price, I expect to be wow'd. I was not and neither was the group. The food was edible and some dishes were better than others. Overall, nothing that anyone said wow that was great or want more of that. When the bill came, shock and awe. 1700+ SGD for 6 people. Price fix menu, 2 bottles of wine and 8 beers. Incredible!None of us will go back for dinner again

I have been to bars all over the world, but never have I been treated as badly in my entire life as when I went to Ku De Ta's Skybar. I was here with a friend of mine eager to check out the view, and we ordered a champagne sangria carafe on the recommendations of our waiter before the last order call. Our carafe of cocktail arrived fifteen minutes after the last order, which was okay with us, as we were not in a hurry. Until a young waiter came up to us a minute after, and, tapping his watch, said to us “How long will you take to finish your drink? I hope you know we are closing up. I give you a maximum of fifteen minutes at most.” There were a contingent of foreigners who were drinking near us. At no point were they  I was dumbstruck. How were we expected to finish a large carafe of champagne Sangria in fifteen minutes?! And how dare a waiter speak to us like he was an army sergeant? I asked to speak to the waiter who took our last order to ask him if we could have some time to finish our drinks, since he had suggested the carafe to us. But things went from bad to worse. He offered three arguments, in increasing order of absurdity: “This is why I told you at 12:30 that we are closing at one”. He certainly did not, which I pointed out, and even if he did, surely it was a bad call on his part to recommend a large carafe for two people to finish in fifteen minutes. “We are a restaurant and not a pub, therefore right after our last order we cannot wait around, and we need to close.” This was an absolutely silly argument, firstly because they were called “The Skybar”, and secondly because they had served us five minutes before their unfriendly reminder to down it. Finally, he said: “How come all the other customers can finish and you cannot leh?”, which was again silly, firstly because no one else had had their order delivered at 12:40, and no one else had ordered a carafe.So we were going to finish our drinks, leave, and just write it off as a bad experience. Until this same waiter came by and said, loudly, “RIDICULOUS!”. That really took the cake. I then spoke to the manager, and I offered to compromise: how about we bring our drinks to the lounge next door? This was rejected outright. Instead, he offered to buy us another drink, and to essentially spend another half an hour being offered death stares by all of his staff.I naturally rejected the offer. And I urge you to never, ever go to this horrible place. What a disgrace to our efforts to become a nightlife destination

Unfortunately with exception of the views, my entire team were disappointed with the quality of the food. Too sour, too salty, too weird, too low value. Lime Sorbet was great but raspberry one was too sharp for any human. Veg options are crap. Don't eat there. Unless you got money to blow, then it really does not matter. Views are spectacular. Laser show is okay but was not worth waiting for. Hope they done charge tourists too much to use the lookout at marina bay. All my friends want to visit KDT but I have to sadly stop them so they can save their money for many other high end restaurants with excellent value foods. By the way the marina bay complex is a wonder of singapore
2
Exorbitantly overpriced for what you get. Desert tasted like 'shake n bake' quality if not worse. Meals small and unimpressive. Foie gras was defnately not the duck's guts (so to speak). Tasted like jellied fat. Tip is included in bill. Can't get a bottle of wine for under $100 either. Service was good.
4
At the top of Marina Bay Sands, Ku De Ta offers amazing views and has a great vibe for a lively night out. The food is very good and service is friendly as well. Not a quiet romantic night out, this is a lively place complete with DJ and an excellent house selection
3
We decided to go up to the top of this hotel and you didn't have to pay if you had a drink/something to eat. It was a misty day and the views could have been better but we enjoyed the fact that we had gone to the top and looked as far as we could. We went up and found ourselves in a restricted area being just a visitor also the seating area was quite shabby and we were disappointed with what could have been a lovely experience. The food was okay
1
My wife and I were told to go there for the food. The view is indeed amazing. The best view we've ever seen. We were there to take the tasting menu which is $148 per person.... without taxes. However, the food was tasteless. We could not even eat the dessert since it was not good at all. The wines are far far too expensive. We had 7 dishes, all small and we were hungry at the end of the dinner. This is not a tasting menu for the price you pay. We went once to Miami and had a tasting menu at a top-notch asian fusion restaurant. 15 dishes and half the price. Ku De Ta should re-think this menu as it is a disgrace to offer this menu and quality at such a price. 2 tasting menus, 1 bottle of red wine from New Zealand and a bottle of still water cost us $500!!!
3
If you go up to Ku De Ta, just think of it as a cheap way to get the view and a drink because on their own, the drinks aren't cheap. One of the best views in Singapore.
5
you simply wont forget the view. classy, fun and young, its a good place to go if you want to live the high life and can afford to splash a bit of cash
4
Food is good and drinks are OK. The view is amazing and is one of the best places to view Marina bay
4
Really good food, the spicy coconut soup was awesome (I like spicy food).
4
Well, it is set on the top of Singapore's sky park, the view is amazing. Service is very good, the staffs are very tentive. Their fusion food taste great except they are bit pricy.
4
The Marina Bay Sands 57th floor was a must do for my husband and I. We had watched the progress of this construction and finally got to the top. What outstanding views and well worth celebrating it with an expensive Singapore Sling which included the elevator ride.Best time is at Sunset
5
If you come to Singapore you MUST go to this place!We went to party on a saturday night and we had a blast! Good drinks, a bit small but they were good, nothing to complain about, good service...Lovely night, we danced while enjoying Singapore's Panorama...!NICE SPOT TO TAKE PICTURES OF SINGAPORE
4
Ku De Ta, at the top of Marina Bay Sands, is a case study in excess. The drinks start at about $15 USD for a beer, and $25 for a cocktail. But certainly worth it for the view alone. Pro tip: arrive early in the evening before the $50 cover charges goes into effect
4
We went to dinner and loved the view. When we were seated we were served by Shari who was clairvoyant. She knew what we wanted before we did. She and the rest of the staff took great care of us. We ate inside where it was cooler and a little quieter. Our favorite was the Crispy Sticky Squid. After dinner Aom, the Guest Relations Manager, introduced herself and gave us a little tour. Thank you Aom you were wonderful
5
This is on the 57th floor , a multi tied restaurant in Marina Bay . WOW , the ambience and the view are fabulous , reservation a must . their steaks are sliced thin and served in the center of the table so that all at the table can share !!I had their lamb in honey miso ..a gastronomic delight and my friend the ribeye! it was excellent . Whatever you eat have some place for the dessert, absolutely awesome ..and then if you are outside you can enjoy the panorama of the Singapore skyline , the seas and the road below .. the walkabout is really an engineering marvel . A must visit and an experience 
5
Do not miss this place, just amazing and go for a drink in the bar to watch the light show. This is a must see !

During school holidays i will go there with my friends for sight seeing and relax our mind in peace...

Expensive hawker food overpriced. Better to get the meals at local hawker centres and coffee shops

Seated on top of the Marina bay Sands Hotel and casino, the Ku De Ta restaurant is a must see. To say that I was excited about trying the cuisine would be an understatement. Anything served in such a posh restaurant should be outstanding but sadly I was in for a shock.I ordered a soup and a main course as did the other members of my party. But to our surprise, the waiter brought me my main course first. I explained that we had requested the soup first and then the main course, to which he argued and finally left with my main dish (Angus beef). He came back later with my soup and the rice my party had ordered. The miso soup tasted good and when were were finished the waiter brought out my cape grim 100% grass-fed red & black Angus ribeye. It was the same dish that he had taken away from the table! It was now cold and unappetizing. In addition the chef had sliced the Angus steak so I doubt that it was hot the first time he brought it. Two of the people in my party asked for crispy duck. It too was sliced prior to serving (making it cold) and the crispy skin of the duck had been cut into squares and sprinkled over the duck like bacon bits, unappetizing. The fourth person in our party had ordered baby chicken teriyaki & cereal tuille, this wasn't served until after we had all finished our meal. Their nouveau approach to Chinese cuisine was lack luster and poorly thought out, and the poor service makes this a place you should visit for drinks and then find somewhere else to eat

I’ve visited three times… once for dinner, once for weekend brunch and once to the bar for evening drinks. The dinner was overpriced, and not very memorable. I was so disappointed that the restaurant has made NOTHING of the fantastic location and views. There are publically-accessible viewing platforms surrounding three sides of the restaurant, so the restaurant has made every effort to shield the evening diners from the tourists… this means curtains and plants obscure any chance of a view. I don't understand the raves about the fantastic views... they're great as you you're walking in, but once you're sitting at your table you literally have to walk outside and gather with all the tourists to see anything.During the daytime brunch the curtains are opened so the views are better, but again, not what you would expect from the location. I’ve visited a few different high-rise restaurants including Altitude at the Shagri-La Sydney, which has floor to ceiling windows with the tables literally against the glass… Ku De Ta is NOT like that.The brunch was very expensive at SGD$88 per person (including all you can order from the full menu). The brunch menu seemed very similar to the evening menu, but also included a great all-you-can-drink smoothie menu and buffet area. So I think the brunch seemed like better value than the dinner.Evening drinks in the bar was very crowded… we visited on Tuesday Night, which is Ladies Night… one free drink for the ladies but I paid SGD$10 for a glass of Diet Coke. And it was impossible to get a spot near the balcony where the good views are. Apparently the bar has a cover-charge of SGD$50 on Friday and Saturday nights, which is ridiculous. Overall, I think this place is overpriced and average
5
If you are in for a vew and a few drinks - you cant go wrong! Ku De Ta offers amazing view of Singapore, the drinks are a bit pricey (typical for Singapore), but the experience is well worth it (and trust me the prices are on the lower end compared to say Sky @57). Food is great - i tried every seafood item on their menu and Black Cod is my favorite
3
Ku De Ta is popular for its height not for the quality of its food, and certainly for the price one pays for food and drinks. A pleasant place to have a good drink and look around in the heavens of Singapore. Don't forget your wallet and get yourself a table weeks ahead
4
It is unlikely to have a more exclusive dining experience in Singapore, Ku De Ta simply has it all: the view, the ambiance, the menu. However, understand that if this restaurant simply were in the city at an average location they could never get away with charging the prices they do. That said, everything was excellent. The menu is expansive although a bit difficult to navigate, however their staff was helpful throughout the entire evening. We must have had about 5 different servers stop by our table. Overall it was a fantastic evening
3
The view and location are fantastic and the service was attentive and polite. As for the food, the starters were the best but the main courses were disappointing. Some potions were small and others just not very good (pork belly) - all in all, the food quality did not justify the high price tag even factoring in the view
2
I went for dinner to Ku De Ta. The location, on top of the MBS building, is absolutely unique and the terrace seating at the tip of the 57th floor platform is amazing. Service was very good and the wine list was also quite interesting. But that was it. We opted for the degustation menu and I must say that the food was quite disappointing. Overlooked meat, not very flavourful sauces and all-in-all nothing original or fusion about the fried calamari or the salad..
1
Over priced, Poor service and worst of all they added two glasses of wine that i never even drank after I had already agreed the bill. I won't be going there again.
4
View is best from the bar, restaurant is expensive and has no view.
2
I also followed advice found around the internets and decided to go here for dinner rather than buy the $20 tickets for the observation deck. First of all it’s important to note that if you are not a hotel guest or have tickets, you still can't get to the main observation deck where the view is best. The view from the inside part of the restaurant is not great because the main deck blocks much of the city view. The inside was also noisy and cramped with the tables placed very close together which was not great for a romantic atmosphere (unless you want to have a romantic conversation with all your neighbors too!). The entrées were quite tasty but miniscule for the price. The staff was friendly and attentive. If you do plan to go, try to reserve an outside table around the edge and order the course menu to get enough food to fill you up… But keep in mind that saving the $20 for the observation deck tickets will be very expensive
4
Originally, we had just wanted to get to the top of the SkyPark observation deck. We went to the SkyPark ticket office, but learned that it was $20 per person and $17 for seniors. Instead of paying that for admission, one of the people in our party suggested we just go to the top to eat. Instead of paying admission, might as well apply it toward the cost of the meal. We did not have access to the observation deck, but the Ku De Ta restaurant is situated at the top of the building. So, to me, this was actually a better decision. Instead of paying to just visit the observation deck, might as well go to the top for free, enjoy a beautiful view, and dine in a really cool setting. The views from the top of the building were beautiful and the breezes atop were a welcome feeling. We could see the observation deck from the restaurant and noticed that the people who paid to go to the deck were not allowed to sit down. We could enjoy the area up top and sit down. The food was good. Portions were not huge, but they were well-prepared. The only thing is the server forgot to bring some mushrooms that I ordered. At the end of the meal, even after they had asked us about seeing a dessert menu, which we declined, the server then brought out the mushrooms. Our meal was done so we told them it was too late, and they removed the mushrooms from our check. All in all, it was a novel experience to enjoy a meal atop the Marina Bay Sands hotel with beautiful views of the harbor and Singapore skyline. And, if you're hungry, it might be a better bet to go ahead and eat at Ku De Ta rather than pay just for admission to the SkyPark observation deck
4
Was at Ku De Ta with a bunch of colleagues after a conference. The view over the Singapore skyline is absolutely stunning, and second to none. The layout of the restaurant allows for cosy corners or larger group dining. The food itself is best described as Asian-fusion, very well prepared and presented. Service was prompt, if a little impersonal. Very pricey. Overall, its worth a splurge if just to see it once
3
Most people visit Ku De Ta for the view – which is lovely, although the view from the bar is better. A note of caution for serious photographers, tripods are not allowed which was quite disappointing. The food was pleasant enough (not over the top as I had hoped) but the cocktails were delicious (albeit pricey as one would expect). The service we received was agreeable, in fact, they even brought my husband a complimentary miniature molten chocolate cake for his birthday
1
The worst fine dining experience ever. This place is NOT related to the lovely Ku De Ta in Bali. They have simply ripped off the name. Overpriced, average food came out in 5 minutes, it must be prepared ahead and heated up to serve. Service rushed us through the courses as if we were eating at McDonalds
4
I had given a review of 3/5 a few months ago so I wanted to try this place again. I must say the rating was based on the food. This time I had gone for dinner all of us tried a wide variety of dishes and all of agreed the food was very good. The Cod was especially good as well as the tuna. There were nice sauces that accompanied the dishes.Service was a bit improved as the staff was a bit more attentive and did a good job of explaining the dishes when they were served.At night thought the windows/doors were closed and the noise in the dining room was quite loud. The accoustics could use some work.For big groups, they had us at a round table which was great as it makes communication so much easier. Also, since the dishes are served 'family style' it makes getting your meal easier. It was a good experience
3
The food was great. No complaints there. Bluefin tuna and beef tataki were the highlights of our lunch.Food and drinks are expensive, and one would expect that due to the location.The one thing we found strange is that Ku De Ta Singapore markets itself for its great view but you get very little of that if you just book in for lunch. We came to watch the JK Racing formula cars on the Friday of the F1 weekend and coule not see anything. You have no access to the bar (the edge of the roof platform) and once sat down, there isn't much to see except the blue sky; which is a shame as with a more thoughtful interior design, this is totally achievable.Something else that also need changing is the staff attitude which varies from one person to the next. The receptionist made us to wait at a bar were no-one had any interest in serving us or even acknowledging our presence. Somehow, the waitress assigned to our table was great. There doesn't seem to be the same training given to all the waiting staff.Overall, an OK place for a one-off visit. Ku Dé Ta needs to do more to entice customers for a second visit

57 floors above Singapore this restaurant did not disappoint. The serivce is first class, and the food is wonderful. Its not perfect though - its let down a bit by being a bit cramped for space, tables are close together, so dont expect to discuss anything private there, and there is only a limited view as the restaurant is locatred in the middle of the sky park. The second point is less concern, before and after dinner you can sample the view outside. The close tables is to me more of a concern, it was very easy to hear what was being said around about. But dont let this put you off, the staff are very attentive and the food is glorious, and after all, why else does one go to a restaurant? There is a dress code for after 6 pm, leave the shorts, sandals, singlets and tank tops in your hotel
5
One of the few restaurants/bars that offers good drinks and snacks with unrestricted view of the city.
4
If you are afraid of heights, this is not the place for you. Can get busy.
3
nice view, but too expensive. It's nothing like its twin in Bali. This is different. Mostly patronised by people who is to be seen and want to be seen.
4
Nice place to have a few drinks, very trendy and great view!
Drinks are quite expensive, but is worth it.
Haven't been there at night, however I have heard has nothing special.
4
Go and eat here just for the view. The foods not to bad either but does dent your pocket
5
Eat at the Ku De Ta *lounge* (not restaurant). Pay the same price for a drink and sandwich as you would for going to the observation deck. Same exact view.
5
Great place for a special dinner and to show off Singapore to guests
4
Stayed at hotel when it first opened, and have never been back. Tried the rooftop restaurant and lucked out with fantastic weather, wide views and a rising full moon. Food was good, interesting menu. Wine list very broad. Service was Singapore standard. Location and view made the evening special. Had to wait 15 min for the elevator ride down
5
Go there! Nice place, nice people, good food...more than good amazing...we had a special new year menu...try it's so funny because it's starting as a ritual...Lovely staff, thank's Mr Tristan..and after dinner..let's dance at the Kuteda club...amazing view, good place to listen house music, and new house music..great DJ...Lovely night
4
The only reason to go and have dinner here is because of the view. Magnificent skyline.We took the sampler platter and the variety is fine, but it lacks the WOW experience, except when you ask for the bill. Service personnel is very friendly and professional
3
Overpriced, under-serviced, food pretty good but nothing great.
4
Fantastic food and restaurant, but really overpriced considering there a millions of equally amazing restaurants ground level of Singapore for half the price. Worth it for a nice view!
5
We found the food very very good, it was fusion gourmet at its best. The wine waiter certainly knew his wines and suggested an excellent read New Zealand wine. The service was very attentive.. We sat outside on the terrace with great views of Singapore. Surprisingly it was cool and the staff provided shawls for the ladies. If in doubt what to order ask the manager for his suggestions
3
They have starters, main, etc. categories in their menu but the first thing you are being told, is that the food comes out to your table as soon as it is done in the kitchen in no particular order. So why have the categories if they cannot manage their kitchen properly? The food is soso, some dishes good some quite bad but all very tiny in almost tapas size proportions and all quite high priced. You are paying for the name, which stands for beach club quiet chique atmosphere. Problem is, the atmosphere you are getting is: Being bussed up and down 52 floors with hundreds of tourists to a visitor platform. Those tourists will then wonder past your table in an endless procession creating an atmosphere more reminisant of a chinese train station then a beach club! I visited twice last week due to business engagments and payed S$ 900 for a party of three and 800 S$ for a party of two, which is quite a lot considering the above! The view is great at the visitor platform but you do not see any of it when seated at the restaurant.On top of all of it, they are pretty snobbish with their table bookings when you call. On two evenings on the weekend I was told that they had no tables, both times I was given a table right away once I arrived, which was no luck, because quite a view tables remained empty through out the evening
3
You should book to go to the bar - avoids having to buy a viewing ticket - take the lift to the 57th floor and see the beautiful view of the whole of Singapore! Watch the sun go down with a cocktail - it's a great place to see Singapore in all it's glory - wouldn't bother to eat there as much better places
1
We were guest at the Hotel and wanted to have a drink and enjoy some cigars.As the bar was closing already we went to the Club Lounge.To our surprised we were charged an entrance fee.Well, the place has nothing to do with a "Club Lounge".No seating area as the whole left part was booked by a group and the right side is available only for members. Of course the little place left was overcrowded.Unfriendly security members and music so loud you cannot communicate.So if you have been to KU DE TA Bali and liked it, DON'T go to KU DE TA Singapore, you will be really disappointed.No Style at all, no lounge, only a place to show off
4
Yes and the food was pretty good too! The restaurant is relaxed yet refined with lots of dishes to choose from. Their Salmon Sashimi was excellent. Only draw back was that the aircon was a little bit to cold! A wrap or cardigan could come in useful
5
I was at Ku De Ta last week for a corporate event and I was super impressed with the level of service given the 2700+ guest jamming the roof of MBS. The event was so well serviced by the Ku De Ta crew who somehow managed to make it seem so personal. Special mention goes out to Ms. Karenal Monte who on separate occasions impressed not just me but other partners who were also impressed by her hospitality. Well done and I'm certainly going back
2
I can t say that was terrible ...but not so great...qualiy f the food not so impressive and the preparation sometime are wrong...for the amount of the persons who works there i was waiting a great service...it wasn t.The view from the roof inspired me much more thanthe restaurant...I will defenetly not come back
4
Obviously, this venue is very nice and has amazing views. The music is also great and the people-watching is unbeatable. The service is pretty average, and drinks are expensive (no big surprise). Also, the clientele seemed like nothing but affluent late 20s / early 30s tourists, so the place had a very transient feel to it.Anyway, good spot for drinks just be prepared to pay an arm and a leg (cocktails range from $20-30 Singapore dollars I think)
5
Fantastic view of Singapore pay S$20.00 per drink from Ku de Ta for free views from the 56 floor
5
Yes, of course it's touristy... but the view is STUNNING!!! &, it's outdoor, so you'll get the wind, the view, the atmosphere... It's THE place to visit when in Singapore.

I have nothing bad to say about this place except for if it's raining season, don't bother going up there...

Drinks at the bar, everything was sparkling clean and impeccably service. Wonderful, wonderful views of distant Malaysia and Indonesia. Just as the sun was going under we went across to our seats in the restaurant. It seems to be that after sunset this place gets even more magical. Candlelight, the winking lights of the ships waiting in the bay, the sizzle and mouthwatering food being brought to the table, and the sheer thrill of being there. The food was astounding..,the wines wonderful...the dessert even more so. I am ashamed to say I had two desserts...and then a large slab of Birthday Cake. The entire evening was MIND BLOWING

The vierw from the top of Marina Bay Sands is wonderful and is well worth seeing iof you are in Singapore. However the Ku De Ta, being situated on the roof of this fantastic construction, does not live up to the same rating. Sevice was slow, food did not turn up in sequence, yes I know that often happens in Singapore but should not in a so called top restuarant. One of the main courses never arrived until all other food was consumed and after several requests to check! Even the reduction in the bill did not make up for the dissapointing experience

This restaurant is an experience and well worth going to. it is on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands so has absolutely beautiful views. The menu is very unique and we ordered 5 different dishes wich was more than enough for 2 of us. They are like large tsting plates and just keep coming out as they are ready which you share all your plates . Beautiful food and reasonably priced

We thought this restaurant was excellent. We started off with a drink in the Club area of the complex which gave us the most tremendous views over Singapore. We moved on to the restaurant and thought the food was brilliant, the service was excellent and we thought it was really well priced. The restaurant is well air conditioned and as it was a bit cooler that night I found myself underdressed during dinner (the locals were much better prepared!). However this wasn't a problem, as the staff brought over a wrap for me and then gifted it to me at the end of dinner. Now that's service!I can hardly tell you how exquisite the hot oil salmon is, or the crispy and sticky squid, the pork salad was divine and even plain old chicken teriyaki was the best I've tasted. In fact, as I write I am dying to go back and dine there again. The whole complex is busy as you would expect with so many hotel rooms and then people dining and people have a look at the observation deck. But it all comes with the territory and it really is a place you need to go and visit. There are certain guest-only areas and as guests were cruising around in their bathrobes after being in the pool area they clearly didn't care that non-guests were there! I recommend arriving to see the sun dip and the city lights begin to twinkle. We'd recommend this as a dining / drinking experience to anyone visiting Singapore and we absolutely loved it. Thank you to everyone who helped make our experience so fantastic

Ku De Ta is split into a few different areas. The Skybar is over on the eastern side, but the Club Lounge has the best views. The drinks menus are the same at both, but if you want to eat at the restaurant you'll need a reservation.If you go on a weekday evening at around 7pm, the views of the city are amazing as the sun sets. The drinks are pricey, granted, but that's not out of the ordinary in Singapore, and the cocktails are very tasty. You get free wasabi crisps too. The music can be hit and miss.On a wednesday night, Ladies Night is good fun with a group of friends. Girls get free drinks and shots at midnight and they sometimes do a prize draw. The music is standard chart music, and the dance floor is usually full. It's free entry Monday-Thursday, on Friday and Saturday it's free before 9pm, but it usually gets full by 8pm so go early if you want to go at the weekend. It's much better than paying to go to the skypark - the views are the same.To get there, take a taxi to Tower 3 of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Go to the little Ku De Ta desk in front of the elevators and say you're going up to the club lounge for drinks. They'll give your outfit the once over (no shorts, flip flops or beach wear) and give you a little card. Take the elevator to the top and hand the card to the security guy at the top, who will point you in the right direction

Ku de TaWife: Expect to pay for a view like thisSitting up in one of the most iconic hotels sipping a cocktail at dusk, that great time when looking over any city were the lights are about to sparkle and alumniate the sky. We decided to try the food in the restaurant it seemed buzy and busy and they managed to squeeze us into a table. Interestingly enough we'd been past in the week to go for a drink and looking at the pictures I'd actually said to my husband the decor looks like a posh holiday in, and that I didn't fancy paying the prices, but my husband said later in the week he really didn't want me to miss the view as it was something special. We had an excellent Sake they actually have a choice from dry to sweet on the list it's 65% It was a great way to start the meal. We decided to go for the 14 course tasting menu having been assured the portions are small. A nice bottle of Billicart Salmon Rose. The bill came to 750 SGD (including 4 cocktails) we had high expectations and I was expecting to be impressed for this. I was delighted with the salt and pepper calamari, the pork bellie salad needed a bit more work on the flavour, the fatty tuna was devine (although I've had better at Zuma in London) I loved that it was served simply with kaffir lime leaves and they don't serve it with wasabi or soy so you can really appreciate the fish. I was let down by the crispy skin duck that didn't have a crispy skin, but I was blown away with the quality, taste, texture of the serloin, it was melt in your mouth magnificent. We didn't manage the froi gras too rich by then. Sampled the small desserts which were nice but not memorable.  Ideally I would of liked a few more wow moments with the food and I'd expect to come away feeling like all dishes were damm good and to have one or two stick in my mind. But for Singapore, the view, the complimentary pashmina because I was cold, Ryan our fabulous waiter who was passionate, interested in the food and your dining experience but not intrusive, following up our meal with complimentary coffees and entry to the club, to sip a few more lychee martinis for me it was a very memorable night. Which I would absolutely repeat if in Singapore. Husband;Loved the view, loved the sashimi especially fatty tuna, calamari, pork salad, steak was un real, wasn't too full just right portion control. Thought service was excellent. Club was good, playing some great tunes, All in all would defiantly go back. ideal for taking clients if wanting to impress.

Much has been written about this place being touristy (it is) and not really a five star style restaurant (it probably isn't). Despite this we decided to go up and have a look after living in Singapore for nearly a year and always wondering what it is like "up there". Given the mixed reviews this place gets (in local web reviews as well as tripadvisor), we were ready to be underwhelmed by the food and service, but hoping to be overwhelmed by the views.We got there at 6 pm, which I recommend, as it gets more and more crowded as the evening goes on. We had reserved a table at 6.30 pm, which we needed to sit down at by 7 pm to avoid losing our booking. This gave us time to wander about the observation deck enjoying the views. Our table was outside, which was pleasant in the cool of the evening, but is not seperated from the constant stream of t-shirt and short wearing tourists wandering about or going to the bar. Fun for people watching but not very 'exclusive". If you want to feel like you are in a more private and separate area, you should book to be seated inside.We found the service to be quick, professional, attentive and friendly. Given the generally poor standard of service in Singapore, it was nice to be looked after by experienced waiters who knew their job and took pride in it. Maybe we got lucky with the particular guys who looked after us. The food is basically a tapas style menu, where you choose various small dishes to share. You eat them as they arrive. We found the food to be rather good, and it arrived fairly promptly. Drinks were a bit expensive, but no more than other hotel restaurants. They also arrived quickly. Desserts were particularly yummy.After dinner you can take your receipt with you to get free entry into the club lounge bar next door. (Separate entrance). We had a final (overpriced) drink to enjoy the view for a bit longer, and to have a peek at the hotel's infinity pool. (Wow!)All in all, we had a very enjoyable evening. We do not go there for the food so much as for the experience, which is probably a good approach. It was our 20th anniversary and so we were happy to splurge, but there are certainly cheaper nights out in Singapore

We had our dinner at this restaurant. We had the degustation menou which was a bit expensive but all plates were amazing!
Also the view is unforgettable .... do not forget your are at the 57th floor!
5
Wonderful views from MBS rooftop but the tourists in the skypark somewhat ruin the privacy. Good food but need more Vegetarian options.
1
The restaurant is located on the roof of the Marina Bay Sands which promises good views. However, probably for wind protection, the al fresco area is surrounded by bushes and trees, so you cannot actually see anything at all. The food has food court quality and is served likewise. Considering the price level and the restaurants understanding as a fine dinging place, this is simply not sufficient. I recommend to simply visit the bar or club if one is interested in the view and going somewhere else for food
3
Views are fantastic. But food is overpriced and not delicious. Had the Wagyu beef which is huge but not tasty.Service is also not fantastic. Not extremely friendly.Place is busy though.Place is very popular especially with the tourists.I wouldn't go back again if i can avoid it
3
Food has definitely improved since the last time we were there and the service was attentive and prompt. We still 'don't quite get it' in terms of the concept with regard to the dishes and the food still feels like it arrives much too hurried. The wine list is still spartan and overpriced in comparison with other restaurants in Singapore outside of MBS and that could definitely do with a little work. Overall it still feels like the restaurant is trying to figure out what it wants to be rather than just a 'place to be seen' but we certainly enjoyed it much more than last time
3
ive heard of the cover charge which isnt very cheap, but i had all along been tempted to visit Ku De Ta as i love chilling with a couple of drinks and super love rooftop bars! lucky for us, my friend had complimentary passes and so off we went to the much raved about bar. my first impression of the place - woah thats it? the place is pretty small and you dun get any tables if you are just having drinks. standing around is fine with me, IF there are places to stand. minus the bar counters, there is a very limited space left for u to stand around, as u dun wanna stand between or next to the tables where pple are having their meals? damn awkward.service? can do a lot better by responding to our numerous attempts to get their attention.conclusion, with complimentary passes i can still consider. if not, forget it
5
Restaurant is located on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, just above the sky park. The restaurant offers a really warm and modern dining experience. Great wine section and the Food is amazingly well prepared and cooked, every course was perfectly cooked and presented.... the service compliments perfectly. I would definitely eat here again next time I’m in Singapore
3
Ku De Ta was recommended as top drawer...it's an experience but it's packed, the acoustics are bad, the food is club standard and the wine list is an expensive mismatch for the food. There is much more to successfully achieving an exclusive dining establishment than location and high priced wine. I suspect that the owner's noble concept has been swamped by the convention crowds and mid-range tourists, like many other restaurants at the top of city towers and resorts. Better quality food and service at the Noodlestar across the road from the Intercontinental Hotel. Do go to Ku De Ta for the experience of dining atop the Marina Bay Sands...but don't expect Michelin stars

Hi all,We went to this club/restaurant in Dec 2011 and despite the high prices you will be paying, we still recommend this place to overseas visitors as well as local Singaporeans. PriceWe paid $140 SGD for 3 dishes, 2 desserts, and 2 plain rice. It is kind of expensive, if you consider just purely the price vs the tastiness of the food. Alcohol here does not come cheap either. Do bear in mind that in general Alcoholic drinks in Singapore comes at a high price due to tax. So for food vs price, we give 6/10 points.AmbienceThe ambience here is great, especially if you take the outdoor seats. At 57th floor, it is very cooling. And the night views there is simple superb. It is the best place to bring a date, your wife or friends there to chill. Besides, from there, you can oversee most of Singapore beautiful landmarks. If you ask us, we say the experience is even better than Singapore flyer. We give 9/10 points for ambience.If you like to see more reviews about Singapore fun places, you can check us out at streetjury.com.Thanks

Not sure about the food, never eaten. This is my favorite late night place in Singapore for drinking and dancing. A M A Z I N G view while at it. Not that xpensive for such a high class place. Also good for an evening aperitivo with friends or business. This is the place to go if yo want to make a good impression.Wassabi chips on the house
4
Worth visiting and pay for a couple of drinks instead of paying the entrance fee to the Skypark.
Great view, great drinks list, great crowd!
4
Best views on the island. Not the cheapest place, but you're paying for the view. Staff pretty competent.
4
This is a fusion Thai restaurant, if I remember correctly. The food is slightly higher than average but comes in small portion. You should not come here with a starving stomach. But the food is great. Spend time in the open air.
4
So impressed with the views of my home city from here. Go at around sunset time, weather would be cooler and you'll get to experience both day and night views.The restaurant was full the day I visited and required reservations. The bar was a good place for chilling
4
The cocktails here are great, the food is good and the location couldn't be better. Careful if you order san pellegrino, it's 12 dollars ++ for a 500 ml bottle and they will ask you to leave if you are wearing shorts in there and the time turns 6 pm, even if you are a pool and hotel guest
4
We solely went to KDT for the view. We didn't expect the food to be that great because we thought it'd be just another overpriced, standard food place like Sirocco in Bangkok. How we were wrong. The food was great, new aged Asian cuisine. The portions are large enough for everyone to be able to have a little bit of this and that. The staff were also very friendly.If ladies feel chilly they also offer complimentary white pashmina shawls.The overall experience was above our expectations but we still believe that it is a little too overpriced
3
We were recommended to try this restaurant, the views from the outside dining are priceless, food service on the evening we went slow and we presume they had challenges in the kitchen getting the food out on time and hot each dish came out Luke warm.Would recommend for the views especially in the evening, and hope the service and food improve
2
We had dinner at the Ku De Ta on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The view is breathtaking but the food is incredibly expensive and really not worth the money.Go to the long instead where you will enjoy Singapore by night and then go have dinner in Chinatownâ€
2
I would suggest to go there for drinks and have dinner elsewhere. The view atop the Marina Bay Sands is breathtaking. Ku de Ta' is the restaurant on top of Tower Number 3. There is a high end restaurant atop Tower Number 1 that I did not see but it had great reviews. Ku de Ta' is a drink only place. The food had to be sent back and was very expensive with poor and neglectful service. There were lots of staff people on th shift, but they were huddled together talking and not serving guests
3
I went with a work colleague for lunch. You needed a reservation to go to the restaurant. It was not too bad to get one. But im sure we went during a slow period.The good thing is you get free access to the roof deck to see great views of Singapore. That would be the only reason i would go back. The food wasn't great on flavor and the portion was a bit small. The bill was a bit over $100 for both of us. I just wasnt that impressed but the view was nice and the staff was pleasant based on Singapore standard of service.
1
bad food, worse service. food came with key elements missing and not 1 of our 8 diners could eat more than a mouthful of the incredible salty noodles ( and 4 of them were chinese) but we were told 'thats how they are!'
4
Had drinks at Ku De Ta bar on the 57th floor of the amaziing Sky Park.Costs £10 to get to the top and £30 for 2 beers and 2 cokes.Worth every penny for the views and the buzz in the bar.A must see if in Singapore
3
Went here on a Monday night. Free entry to sky tower included. The view has to be the best in Singapore, but the bar itself is over rated. Drinks very very expensive, and the music just OK. All in all go just for the view, but don't drink much to save your pennies
3
The view is the only thing great about this restaurant, and you can see it without going to the restaurant/bar. Worth a cocktail or a beverage but food is poor, overpriced and not tasty at all ! not much else to say here - but better places to spend your money for dinner
3
I visited here with a group of work colleagues one evening, and we all had the set menu which costs SG$198++. Unfortunately no-one was impressed with the food - it's average at best, and definitely not worth the money. Not all the tables even have views of the city, so you're better off eating somewhere better/cheaper, and just enjoying the view from Ku De Ta bar or the Sky Park. I won't be going back
5
Amazing view of Singapore and some amazing people dining on the rooftop. Music is fantastic as well. Just a bit pricy , but around 10.00 p.m. it turns into a club !! IF u want to new people & have a great night , a must visi
4
This is located in Marina Sands and offers the same view as the Sky park. We got late in reaching the sand skypark (which closes at 11) so went to this bar/club. I found it to be very nice. Gives you good views of the city, crowded and a hip place. The drinks are reasonable and overall a good way to get the feel of Marina Sands
3
.....I would not come back. Yes, the location is stunning and the views are really special, but the whole place is a big rip off. Long queues at the reception and not sure if they let you in, part of the location is "members only", you can only book a table if you accept a minimum consumption of SGD 1.500 for a party of six, the waiters have no clue about the menu and are unable to explain or recommend drinks...well I was not convinced. But if you just want to have a drink and there is no queue, go and enjoy Singapore from a higher level
2
We went there for some food and drinks one afternoon.Though the place was not crowded, it took us a long time to get the staff's attention to order as most of the time, the staff were busy chatting. And it took ages for food and drink to come. The food was surprisingly not too bad. Scenery was limited especially if you sit down on the couches too
5
Whilst staying at Marina Bay Sands Resort, we decided to book dinner at Ku De Ta Restaurant for the final night of our honeymoon, hoping for an experience that was special. Upon arrival, we were greeted by exceptionally friendly staff and seated with the most picturesque backdrop to admire. We ordered from the extensive menu and were pleasantly surprised by the serving size (not miniscule like at some restaurants). The food was amasing, a magnificent blend of flavour and freshness. The staff were attentive and eager to please. When we return to Singapore, Ku De Ta will be on our itinery for sure
5
The atmosphere is unbeatable. Period. The top of the Marina Bay Sands is a destination all by itself. The food is great and service is good. A little high as far as value, but you are paying for the fabulous view. Would definitely go back.
5
Loved the degustation, reasonable prices and delicious!

I visited this restaurant on December 6 night together with my two colleagues. We liked: perfect service, fine food and original wine list, overall atmosphere. Didn't like: we couldn't get a table with a view onto the city depsite that the reservation was made in advance. SPECIAL THANKS TO ARRIANNE who caught me up at the exit with my iPhone that I forgot on the table

Been to Ku De Ta a few times and never really felt it was worth all the hassle and cost. so your up high but that can't explain the lack of service. Bouncers - DO NOT talk to them, say one word wrong and you will find yourself held up by two guys while a 3rd and 4th threaten you while still calling you Sir. I went with my wife and two friends and found out that one of my party would get in due to their strict no shorts policy, i can live with this and was happy to leave, as we was walking away one of my party commented on what he thought about that policy and was then grabbed by the bouncers and then in the situation listed above. I had to push my way in to get them to release him so that we could leave.While i was trying to diffuse the situation I had one of the bouncer pulling at me telling me to leave unless I wanted to get some of this too (he says waving his fist at me). I have grown up in London and have been used to Bouncers being a bit heavy handed but this was not only uncalled for and way over the top. this is not the first time i have seen the guys there get their point across by surrounding the problem person and threatening to kick their head. Not what you expect from a high class place. any management of MBS feel free to contact me
5
This was our second visit to Ku De Ta. The first time it was just the 2 of us. This visit we took our adult daughters and had an absolutely wonderful time. We started in the lounge which is on the opposite side of the rooftop. We took pictures as the sun was setting and a cool breeze blowing in the open area overlooking the city. We then moved to the restaurant to have an excellent meal with a mixture of seafood, vegetables and meat. We had some excellent wine to complement the meal. After dinner we asked for a table out on the sky deck to enjoy the evening and have a fantastic selection of desserts along with sangria wine. The service was excellent and the staff was very helpful in selection of a diverse mixture for our main course. We made reservations about 3 weeks in advance as we had a very specific date we wanted to visit Ku De Ta and the weather was very accommodating
2
nice view, average food, pay for the view, so many other better places to go in Singapore, I can imagine that only uninformed tourists would bother to eat at Ku De Ta, which was pretty much the vast majority of the clientele when I was there for lunch
2
Went to Ku De Ta expecting to find a stylish and memorable experience. Headed up to the bar after going through goofy security guards whom seemed to think they were guarding state secrets. Once at the bar, I wanted a simple Manhattan. I had to explain to the waitress what it was and she said if it wasn't on the menu it couldn't be made. Decided to stick with the drinks menu and ordered a vodka martini with a twist. Came with olives and was very weak. When I returned it, she brought the SAME drink back with a twist. A martini that tasted of both olives and lemons. They wouldn't make me a new drink. Anyways, after trying hard to like the bar experience we gave up and left. And the bill for two, with four drinks, was more than S$120.00. Forget it. There are better bars in town like the Hyatt where they make good martinis, esp at happy hour
4
Besides the view, The food is served in small portions so you don't over order, or over eat. The mains like the egg dishes are large enough for one person, so order wisely so everyone has a taste of every dish. Irene and her amazing staff will take care of you

Friends were visiting Singapore and decided to stay at the Marina Bay Sands. They invited me to join them for dinner at Ku De Ta, where I was to meet them. I am a woman and arrived on my own. By the time I found them, I had gone through no less than 6 interrogations as to where I was going, if I was staying in the hotel, who exactly I was meeting and why.. (on arrival in the foyer, on entering the lift, on EXITING the lift, on entering the restaurant area, on entering the pub area and on entering the pub itself!) Whilst I understand there may be an issue with ladies of the night at this hotel, I am of an age and was dressed in a manner that would preclude me from this activity. By the time I found my friends, I was late, having been stopped so many times, annoyed, insulted and embarassed. We were seated outside and there is no mistaking the incredible view. We were a party of 5. It took over half an hour for our first drink to arrive and our food was brought out as it was ready, rather than all together. We had to ASK each time we needed something and despite there being 4 waiters standing near our table, they clearly were not paying attention to the proceedings of our dinner experience. The smoking area is at least a 5-7 minute walk away from the restaurant (on the other side of the roof area near the club), which meant another gauntlet of "bouncers" to work one's way through and back again. The whole roof area is outside and not having a smoking area somewhere near the restaurant is simply annoying. The ridulousness of this problem does not disuade me from smoking, it only disuades me from visting there again as it is inconvenient. We were not the last diners to depart (it was before midnight), but as we walked through the restaurant to leave, we noticed it was being cleaned after dinner service and breakfast was being set up for the next morning. We had to walk around people with brushes and pans and trays of cutlery. Aside from being made to feel MOST unwelcome on arrival, made to feel we had outstayed our welcome on departure (despite the food taking an age to be served), poor service in general and the smoking area issue, I simply would not visit Ku De Ta again if I had the choice. I was really disappointed and rather wished I had chosen to take my guests to one of my tried and trusted restaurants in Singapore ... and one with a smoking area

This is an amaze g restaurant on top of the Marina Bay Sands resort. It's on the 57th floor, with an incredible view. There is a viewing deck to the side of the restaurant for guests, with views across most of Singapore. The food was great. We had a 9 or 10 course set degastation menu, which include oysters, soft shell crab, lobster, fillet steak, and many more dishes. There is a night club as part of Ku De Ta, which is next to the infinity pool, and unless you're a guest at the resort, this is pretty much the only way you'll see it... And it looks awesome!It's a good restaurant with a brilliant view, and worth it for the experienc
3
Ku De Ta as a bar/cub that despite it's fantastic setting is distinctively average. The drinks are expensive (although a lot of bars are just as pricey in Singapore) and atmosphere is poor. The music they play is thumping - it's bad dance music (I wouldn't necessarily be overly keen on any loud music being played mid-week in a bar but bad dance music is bordering on offensive) and the decor looks cheap and tacky. It's overcrowded, packed with tourists, and you find yourself being continually jostled as patrons fight for the best views. In short - not a relaxing experience. The views are great, although, personally, I'd rather be at one of the bars across the river looking at Marina Bay Sands than in Ku De Ta looking down. It's perhaps worth doing just the once whilst in Singapore if only for the views but I wouldn't plan on spending much time there: go at the beginning of the night and then on to somewhere better. One thing to note that it is quite a walk from the MRT so advisable to take a taxi and if you do take a taxi, make sure you tell them Ku De Ta (which is in the last tower) as you'll have to walk through the entire hotel just to get there - more of a problem if you are wearing heels
2
Have been going to Ku De Ta in Bali for many years & whilst we understand the restaurants have different themes we were so disappointed in Singapore! From the moment you walk in its like they are trying to rush you through to get your table for the next guests. Whilst the food is lovely its not amazing ,Chicken was burnt and the Forty Flavours rice was dry and overdone. The wait staff were really professional but too much in your face, they kept pouring the wine over us while we were trying to eat our meals, mind you we still had ample wine left in our glasses. We booked weeks prior via email and asked for a table with a view and got put right in the middle of the room behind a large pillar. Really disappointed. Would recommend going up to the bar for a drink but not for dinner
4
One of the best experiences i have had. The City of Singapore looks phenomenally good from this 57th floor restaurant, which is based on the top floor of the marina bay sands hotel. A truly great experience !!! However, even though the food was good, one expected a better fare from a restaurant of this clas
5
WOW!!! What else can be said? Chef Dan Seagal has set the bar in Asian Fusion.What a memorable meal,with fine service by Tristan,our server. I am not a foodie,but I know what I like,and I love KU DE TA in Singapore.And thank you for the shawl later in the evening as the temperature dipped to 85
4
The food is always excellent, which is why I keep returning. Same sort of concept as Nobu but its not at the same level yet. There are some problems with service: order your wine well before your food or you might end up eating before it arrives.... Sometimes all the food arrives at once so the hot plates are cold by the time you are done with the cold dishes. Its a great setting though but be sure to book in advance and ask for a table outside
2
minummilistic food , average quality, terrible value for money. surely people must just go for the fantastic view over the bay, cant for one minute think they would go for food.we ate in most of the top restaraunts and we thoroughly enjoyed them all exept this one!this is the only place in singapore where we were ripped off!!!
3
Having been up to Ku De Ta many times (normally to take overseas guests for the view) I must say someone has been complaining as the service was actually pretty good this time - in the past EVERY time it was appalling service with rude and even conceited staff.the drinks are always very expensive but that is what you pay for a view like that I suppose....thanks to the management who have actually listened to our plea for good service - well done Ku De Ta
4
Our hotel concierge recommended going to the Ku De Ta lounge instead of paying the $20pp ticket to see the top of the Sky Park, and we're glad we did. The bar/lounge is just average, with average food. But of course the view is incredible, as is the architectural structure itself. Great way to see the infinity pool which is difficult for non-guests and just visitors to see. And with just a drink and a pizza we got a quick meal for the price of what would have been the tickets
4
We went for dinner with my fiancÃ©. We ordered two appetizers which were clearly to share between 2 or 3. Then one main course each. It was too much food although we were not advised. One bootle of white wine and a dessert to share. All was SGD 310 (about $240) which is reasonable considering the place and the exclusivity. Would I come back? No, it's worth just once! The night view is spectacula
3
This is not easy to write. So the food was of obvious very good quality. The cooking was good but over priced and the fantastic service was let down by the fact that one seemed to be rushed.Overall a good once over experience on the taster menu. Not sure if I would visit again. Would suggest to friends with a caviet.
5
We visited there during a fixed Menu promotion We requested vegetarian meals , and the restaurant had put in great efforts to put together a very good menu. They made sure that we could get a taste of all possible flavors in this mealTop Class service Great ambience , and beautiful vie

My family and I were staying in the Marina Bay Sands and decided to have dinner in KUDETA. Let me start with the food, me and my mother ordered the tuna, it was wonderful and cooked perfectly, my father had the salmon, a bit sweet to his taste but still tasty and my husband had the tuna tartare, it was very fresh and delicious and it would have been perfect if there was bread. The view is magnificent, while waiting for our food to arrive we walked around the outside bar and took photos. The service is magnificent, my parents arrived first and is not very fluent in English and was struggling to order their aperitifs, our waitress when she heard them speaking in French, was kind enough to switch to French and explain the menu and restaurant concept in French and even took our orders in French, what fantastic service for an Asian restaurant! The Gewurztraminer the sommelier recommended is also very good according to my mother and husband. It went well with the tuna. Cost is a little expensive but the experience is all worth

I have recently returned from Singapore where I had the pleasure of dining at Ku De Ta, which sits atop the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The main purpose of my trip was to stay at the Sands and check out their amazing infinity pool on the 57th floor.While I have some issues with the hotel itself, the pool complex - the SkyPark - did not disappoint. It was truly spectacular. But as incredible as the enormous infinity pool was, the highlight of the SkyPark was Ku De Ta. Ku De Ta is a restaurant that sits on a prime piece of SkyPark real estate near the pool. It has both indoor and outdoor seating and views that I can’t even begin to describe. As I am sure is true with many first time visitors to Ku De Ta, it was that view which drew me to the restaurant. But as magnificent as the glittering panorama of Singapore was, it ended up being the food and the outstanding service that made my night such an unforgettable experience. My Riesling was exceptional and my curried prawn tempura absolutely delicious, but above all else was the fantastic service.Take away the lofty setting and even bring the food down a notch, from great to good, and I would still recommend Ku De Ta based on the wonderful service. My original reservation was for an outdoor table, but a sudden lightening storm made sitting outside impossible. Yet, even though the restaurant was quite busy, the hostesses got everyone inside quickly. They then somehow managed to seamlessly accommodate all of us without bothering the people who were already seated inside. From there, the service only got better. While they were all very attentive and charming, my main server was a young lady named Vinaya. Vinaya was never intrusive, nor did she hover uncomfortably over my shoulder, yet she always managed to be there when I needed her. She also managed the difficult task of striking that balance of warm and friendly yet completely professional. Towards the end of my meal, Vinaya’s manager stopped by to ask if I had enjoyed everything and to buy me a second glass of Riesling. Later, as I was paying my check, I asked if there was any room at the bar. I was having such a good time I wasn’t ready for the evening to end. At that point, a young lady named Aom, the Customer Relations Manager, greeted me at the bar and proceeded to buy me yet another drink on the house. Keep in mind that I am by no stretch of the imagination a VIP. Ku De Ta just seems to be consciously rejecting that ridiculous “you’re lucky to be here” attitude, where restaurants and clubs treat their customers with cold indifference or even overt rudeness. At Ku De Ta they appreciate your business and go out of their way to create an environment that shows it. I have had the good fortune to travel extensively, and I have enjoyed many memorable evenings at restaurants and bars around the world, but this is the first time I have ever been inspired to review one of them. There is just something special about Ku De Ta that goes far beyond its mind-blowing location. I highly recommend you give it a try if you are in Singapore

This restaurant was "HOT' so have to make advance booking. However, other than the good environment and the good view since it is on the roof top of the Marina Bay Sands, nothing is great. It is kind of noisy and bad food. Not worth for a try, for a drink is ok. Far over price, around SGD 200 per person and taste bad. We ordered around 8-9 items with multiple portion to share but nothing is good. The seafood soup, it is taste like the wonton soup without wonton, basically shrimp shell soup with shrimp and octopus. Fillet is like hard jerky. Vegetable is old and taste bad.Reservation staffs is kind of rude and arrogant. They want to take down all your creditcard details including the security code at the back of your card. Virtually someone abuse your card, you know where are they coming from. I have never experienced a request like that before. She simply tell you this is their restaurant policy. Good selection of wine and may be is just a place for drink but forget about the food

When I was on a business trip to Singapore, I and my colleagues were in a search of place to hang out and enjoy a drink or two. We asked our local office mates and they suggested this really cool place to chillout on a summer night. Ku de Ta Club Lounge is located in Marina Bay Sands hotel, the view from the top was breathtaking. It was a weekend so the place was overcrowded. We ordered beer, though it wa good but found it a way too expensive. The place is worth a visit for a change but can cost you as much as $100 for mere 3 drinks
1
Went for a drink here, we would have stayed longer for a meal but the staff were so bad I just wanted to leave as soon as I could.The key selling point of this place is the view, which is stunning, but it doesn't excuse the awful staff. They seem to think they are too cool to actually serve their customers, instead prefering to chat with each other at the bar. When we did eventually did get someone to take our order they poured it and left it on the bar in the sun for 10 minutes, we did draw this to the attention of our waiter who gave us a withering look but still did nothing. Eventually my husband got up and got it himself, it was now warm and the ice had watered it down so much he had to ask for another (normally I'd leave it but when your paying THAT much for a drink you feel you have to).I would strongly advise people to avoid this place, it's expensive enough to get up the observation deck and so it's tempting to try and get more for your money stopping for a drink to absorb the view but it's just not worth it
1
The restaurant:Beautiful setting and view, and yes we knew it was going to be expensive but when paying that amount we at least expect to eat DECENT food and that was not the case...The food is ridiculously bad especially for what you pay for. You can see they try to make an effort but the ingredients just don't taste fresh or good. They could make such a hip and trendy place out of it with excellent fusion food but i guess they are just happy with the one time tourists. The club/ lounge:Probably the worst service and customer service in Singapore. Rude, careless and snob are the only words that comes into my mind when thinking of most of the staff there, I almost feel like they are the customer!!! shame coz the place has an amazing view and use to be a good party venue. Good thing new clubs have opened nearby, they might not have the view of Kudeta but at least the staff is friendly and flexible and the crowd is in-vogue (Which is what we look for when we pay that amount of money for bottles / entrance
2
This is a great view, but the menu, the service and the prices made me feel that the restaurant was just running the tourists through their system. The view is great and the atmosphere in the bar area is hip, but don't ruin the good vibe by sitting down for dinner.

This is an Ethereal place that has to be seen to be believed. Next to Shinji and Cut, these are Singapore's best. I can only imagine that the few negative reviews came from people with small budgets. Don't come here if you're on a budget! Exclusivity comes at a price! Bravo Ku De Ta

My colleagues steak was the best of the trip....the drinks are grossly overpriced as is the food. The food was good but portions are tiny. Make sure you ask for a window table as anywhere else kind of defeats the purpose. Service was good but its obvious they are rushing you. I would avoid as there are so many better places to eat in Singapore
3
There's not to much to speak about... Is an average Restaurante in an amazing place (more than 150 high). The deck view is fantastic. The food is average quality, good service ( as usual in Singapore). Interesting tourist spot...

We had tickets to see The Lion King performance at MBS and after the play we headed for a few Mojitos at the Ku De Ta Sky Bar. We loved the place as it combines great views, fantastic atmosphere and delicious cocktails. The lounge music was at a perfect volume and the service was correct. I have no complaint at all about this cocktail bar and I would recommend it to anyone
4
We were looking to visit the sky-park to see the view but as we were well dressed for the casino and dinner we ended up in the bustle being directed to KU DE TA - what an expected suprise. Groovy music, amazing view nice wine and snacks but at a cost.We thought the night was amazing and to be honest the view and music made it - we didn't think twice about the cost of the wine as we would have paid the same to go to the sky-park and not have had the cool atmosphere or drinks!We would most definitely go back again and take friend
4
The restaurant itself is nicely done, and the staff were really friendly and accommodating. Service was prompt and their famous baby squid dish was very good (I don't know about the other dishes though) which was just priced right to my surprise. I went there on a weekend so the restaurant was busy and people were beginning to queue outside, but lucky for me I was staying in the hotel so I had the chance to book ahead. The best thing about Ku De Ta is the amazing view of the city (even better to come at night) from all directions. When in Singapore I would recommend at least one visit to Ku De Ta
4
I like the Corona beer though it was quite expensive. I also liked the service at Ku De Ta and saw some interesting people and celebrities there. Nice place to hang out with friends and family. The Filipino waiters were friendly and they spoke Tagalog to us so it felt like I was home. Cool place! Nice ambience

Having been to the real KDT in Bali, which was really good, and since we were now in Singapore for a couple of days we thought we'd like to have a beer at KDT and check the view.Firstly, the Singapore KDT has nothing to do with the KDT in Bali and it shows. Housed a top the Marina Bay Sands hotel the whole place is Disney transported to Singapore with loads of down market peope wandering around. When we arrived at KDT's entrance we were met by a bevy of 'heavies' wanting to know what what we had in mind. "A drink" I replied and we were let through to the outside bar area. I checked the price of two regular sized beers - US 35 !!!!!! This ampount included tax but on the menu the extra tax is hidden away in about 4 point type.The beer was fine and the view great but the service is really bad with po faced waiters never smiling and giving one the distict impression they're doing you a massive favour and that they are 'serving' under duress. KDT is one of these places one should visit as a tourist until, someone builds a taller hotel which has a better bar/view then everybody will move on. Such a shame as if one orders drinks at these insane prices then the least one expects is a smile. Actually, just a trace of a smile would suffice
5
After being recommened to take a "trip" to the top of the Marina Sands for the spectacular view arround Singapore we ventured into The KuDeTa to see if we could have a meal. Although we hadn't booked Irene Wong found us a table for two where I enjoyed a cocktail & Peter a refreshing beer. The meal that followed was the best we've had for a while and reasonably priced . I had a really nice glass of Sav Blanc but at $17 a glass I thought alittle expensive, but maybe thats compared to aussie prices . The waiter gave excellent service and Ms Wong went out of her way to make the overall experience extremely enjoyable. What a charming hostess she is. We can't wait to return
2
As a regular at the real Ku De Ta Bali I was excited to try Singapore, clearly the only thing they share is the name! The set lunch menu while very reasonably priced was just a joke. The only good thing was the Bollinger Rose but I guess they cant take credit for that. The view is amazing, if you have a good table, the place is so badly designed that most tables dont have a view at all. Does not diserve to carry the Ku De Ta nam
4
It's just great to be outside on a beautiful warm night with great views. Drinks are quite expensive, and apparently it gets really crowded on weekends, but on a Wednesday night it wasn't too bad. Maybe not worth a whole night, but certainly worth a visit and a drink. Staff were very obliging, letting us use a reserved table on the perimeter until the people who booked it arrived
5
I went here with my husband for our 1st wedding Anniversary on Sunday and had the most amazing time. I had mentioned that I would like to get a table with a view if possible as it was a special occassion and they said they would make a note of that but could not promise anything. We had some great cocktails whilst waiting for our table and the view is nothing short of jaw dropping. When our table was ready they took us to the best table in the restaurant and came over with complimentary champagne for us. The food is great, the view is great, the staff were very attentive yet didn't fuss too much. Over all we couldn't have picked a better spot. The food/wine is not cheap but this no everyday restaurant. Save up and go - it is worth every penny
4
Perhaps the good company helped, but we had a great evening. Service from the front door to the bill was attentive, prompt and friendly. Thank you!
5
Eventough it is pricey but it's worth to dine for because the quality, taste and ambience is marvelous. We took the tasting menu and it was great. The atmosphere is great too because the location is on the 57th floor and you could see Singapore Skyline from it.The experience was Two_Thumbs_Up

I went with family an friends to Ku De Ta on one of the Aug Sundays hoping to show them the nice view from sky garden and enjoy a nice meal. Turn out, only the passage way to Ku De Ta restaurant and lounge is open for Ku De Ta guests. One cannot walk to the front part of sky garden or the corridor back of infinity pool. Appearantly this restriction is not applicable in weekdays. I think the staff that make reservation show let guests know about the restriction before hand. The restaurants reception in hotel lobby and restaurant entrance are not friendly at all. The waiter that serve us was very good. However the food quality was only average. Salad dressing of pork belly salad was good but the pork was tough and tasteless. Beef stewers was not tender and without much favor
2
We have heard enough hype about this restaurant so we finally decided to try it out on our last day during the recent trip. Upon exiting the elevator, we saw several big guys blocking the entrance to the restaurant, one of them barking "do you have a reservation?" at us. We did have a reservation and it would have been nice if instead of barking at their guests, they would have said something along the lines "welcome" and/or "we are glad you would be joining us for dinner." But no, aparently noone trained these big guys about being polite, welcoming, and caring about first impression. So, from this rude introduction everything else went downhill as the entire staff at the restaurant behaves pretty much the same way as those dudes at the door. Waitresses and waiters walk around with so much attitude that you would want to get up and leave midway through your dinner. They either totally ignore everyone who dines at the restaurant or act super bothered if god forbid you ask them something. As if they are feeding you for free. But in reality, you will be paying tons of money for food that is nothing particularly special. Don't expect anything amazing or interesting on the menu, it is averagely boring. And it tastes just the same - kind of boring. And if you plan to spend tons of money on rude service and blah food just because of the "view" then perhaps reconsider. You can enjoy the view for free and then take the elevator down and get yourself away from this place to somewhere delicious and delightful, where you can actually enjoy the entire dining experience.

I visited the Marina Sands hotel whilst on business in Singapore. It costs 20 SD to visit the 57 floor , however if you are going up to have a drink or meal it costs nothings. I decided to dine at Ku De Ta, an truly memorable lovley evening. Its so nice in Singapore as a female on own that you can travel anywhere and feel totally safe . I had a ball that evening ,firstly visiting raffles and then taxi ( very inexpensive) to the Marina sands hotel.Its a totally cool ambiance , felt like something out of a hollywood movie . Great music , great mixture of people and great food. Certainly expensive , but a fabulous experience. Highly recommend it , just go !

This was our second visit to Ku De Ta, the first was my anniversary during a weekday before watching the Lion King at Marina Bay Sands theatre. The first time we went, we had an early light dinner, with good wine, and enjoyed immensely the ambience and the view. This time, we took my wife's sister there on a Sunday night, generally with the same expectations of good food, wine and the stunning view from atop the MBS Sky Park.Unfortunately, access to the main deck is not allowed on weekends and Fridays, which was rather upsetting given that was part of the value proposition of dining up there. The restaurant manager, Irene Wong, came to the rescue and allowed my sister-in-law and daughter to view the panoramic view from corners of the restaurant's open area. She and her crew also took special care of our needs as we worked our way through the appetizers and main dishes.Ah the food. The great thing about KDT is that they serve everything family style, and bring out dishes one at a time, so the table can enjoy each one together as they come. First the "starters" .... the Crunchy Jumbo Softshell Crabs which was delicious especially with its special sweet peppery sauce. The Spicy 'Bo Ssam' Pork Belly Salad was delightful if not a bit too spicy for my daughter's taste (I loved it). And the Citrus & Soy-cured Duck and the Char-Grilled Australian Beef Skewers were also fantastic. We were already getting filled up when the two main dishes of Roasted Scottish Salmon and Juicy ‘Toh Farms’ Fried Chicken were seamlessly served with organic japanese steamed rice and Lotus Fried Rice. The chicken was brilliantly flavored with a coriander and garlic dressing, while the salmon was glazed with chinese date and soy sauce. At the end of the meal, we were just properly filled and not feeling like we overate, given that most of what we ate was relatively light, healthy and delicious. We topped it off with a fresh fruit platter, after which we thanked Irene and the waiters for in the end a lovely evening

My friend and me decided to hang out at the famous KuDeTa. Arriving during the rainy evening, we manage to get a decent spot facing the swimming pool and without a surprise, the view it offer is absolutely fascinating and that itself have made my evening. With the nice upbeat music and a chill drink in hand, what else can you ask for. I see no reason to complaint and we did enjoy ourselves just like everybody else who mind their own business.

Coming up the elevator and walking on the common passageway with other tourists, visitors or hotel guests ( in bathrobes and bedroom slippers) whilst you are dressed to the nine for a night out is the first set back and dissapointment to the arrival at this restaurant. The outdoor setting for dining and drinks is truly stunning because of the city and sea views. However the food concept is rather disappointing with the portions to share and after a few visits we are just tired of it. Plus the restaurant was not at all accomodating when we asked for sides like wasabi ( we ordered salmon sashimi) or cut chillies to suit our palate . Its a Asian fusion food right ? The service staff, reception and so forth is just not like a 5 star restaurant or hotel service; they are abrupt, no warmth and slacking - I keep half expecting that Ku De Ta Bali efficiency, warmth and experience 
4
Worst service in Singapore. Go up for the view but don't bother with ku de ta. Overpriced rubbish with non-existant service. At $90 for 3 drinks you'd expect some kind of service. I had to go up to the bar 3 times and even then was ignored until I yelled for some service!!! Just don't bother forcing them to take your money
4
Thank you, Ku de Ta for taking my review seriously and making the difference. After 3 months of waiting, I wasnt even sure if I wanted to take my family for the experience. And decided that I will give it another try. Not wanting to sound the Director of the place (who wanted me to contact him if I were to give the place another chance) in advance, I thought I'd surprise myself or not.... And what a difference! I was really happy with the service. Michelle (I think that's her name) was amazing. She's attentive, giving us suggestions on the food and wine. She really knew what wine to serve with the brief description of my preference. The food came out almost at the same time and we enjoyed the evening very much. It was a memorable evening especially for my mum. Thank you for making the difference. Well done

High prices and terrible service, sound good? I suggest you make a reservation, go there, walk around, take some pics, and get out! don't pay for the crappy food, drink and service. These guys deserve to go out of business!

This restaurant is very impressive with a fantastic view of Singapore. Situated atop the Marina Bay Sands building.... Great spot for dinner, drink and view... Be sure to book a reservation as it gets very busy
5
A unique bar with a great view, I have been to many roof top bars including those in New York, Shanghai and Bangkok and this one is up there with them.We went at night and saw the gorgeous skyline as well as enviously admiring the infinity pool only available to the hotel residents. We got in free (however this may have been because we were going on a national holiday).Drinks are expensive (but not more so than London clubs), the service can be slow.The clientele are either city workers, expats, or singa girls trying to find themselves a white man. More of a bar than a club.Definately worth a visit for a picture or of views of the Singaporean night skyline if you're a tourist

It was a stop over and we had only one night in Singopore. When we went to the top of Marina Bay Sands SkyPark KU-DE-TA restaurant, the view was amazing. One should really see Singopore from the top of SkyPark. KU-DE-TA is not a really high class dining place. It is also touristic and expensive. But it is normal, there are hundereds of people trying to get the view. It is always very packed and you need reservation long before for a table. When we explained that we would really appreciate a table since we have very limited time and gonna catch our plane, the whole guest relations team really did their best to fix a table in this over crowded restaurant.Thanks to the Guest Relations Agent Joan in KU-DE-TA and all staff helping us to find a table for our only night in Singapore.Haka

The food was good, but what started out nicely ended up lacking in detail. I don't like that my espresso arrive 10 min after I finish my dessert. Empty glasses during the meal etc. You choose the place because of its location, not because of the food. It is then disappointing that after paying SGD 800 for the party we had to pay an extra SGD20 per person to be allowed entry to Skypark for a drink. Find a nice place in town instead of going to Marina Bay Sands!In general, Singapore needs to start focusing on quality not just the money. No quality no money ...from me
2
The food: terrible. The restaurant profess to be gourmet, but only two out of seven courses passed muster: foie gras and deep fried squid. The rest was nonsense. The restaurant: kind of trendy, but lack attention to detail. The outdoor terrace doubles as club with dj, but ugly and prominent loudspeakers ruin the style. The view: grea

We had a VVIP in town and decided to have a farewell dinner with some clients and our VVIP guest. As the VVIP was staying at MBS we decided to keep it in-house and try Ku De Ta. Now I had not previously been to Ku De Ta so had no preconceptions other than what was written up on this site and word of mouth from friends and colleagues. Interestingly the feedback from friends and colleagues was mostly very positive, whcih is not the case on this site. We had an outstanding experience on all counts. It was raining and very humid the night we were there so the view, in the early part of the night was non-existent. We settled at a large round table and reveiwed the menu and the wine list at length while chatting about the day's events. We quickly decided to all have the 'Tasting Menu', which turned out to be a great idea. I cannot stress how good the Tasting Menu is, especially for a larger group. For the Tasting Menu the food is placed in the middle of the table, in true Asian style and one digs in with chopsticks provided and move the food to your plate for eating. Almost all of us (party of 9) enjoyed almost every dish served. Some were a little challenging and some pleased some of us more than others, but overall there was very little left on any of the plates. The menu has a good mix of fish, seafood, beef, chicken, vegetable and even fois grois (not a fave of mine, but it was very nice I had to admit). My french colleague was so impressed that he negotiated well to get a larger share of it.We ordered some excellent wines from New Zealand and Argentina. The wines are not cheap, but this is Singapore and it is MBS so you just have to expect that its not going to be cheap. If you want cheap go to the hawker centre.We finished up the night about four hours after we started, all very happy and well fed. Then we stepped out to the viewing deck and there was Singapore in all her magnificant lighted beauty!! Wow....I have lived in Singapore for many years now and thought I had seen all the best views. I was wrong, this was just spectacular. Back to the restaurant. Service was excellent. Our every request was met with a smile and efficient and friendly response. We changed numbers twice inside of 15 minutes and the chairs were taken away and replaced without the slightest grumble. The food was served hot if it was hot and cold if it was cold. The wine was at the perfect drinking temperature. At no time did we feel as though the staff were ignoring us and we had only to raise a hand and one or more of them were there to see what we needed.Mindful of some of the comments elsewhere on this site about service, I was careful to note how other tables were going. I saw local families and couples enjoying the same level of service as were we, including the couple with the young baby who started to cry quite loudly early in the night. The staff helped with the baby while the mother got organised and within a minute it was life back to normal for us all. Really great effort.Overall this was one of my better restaurant experiences in Singapore which is not known for the best service in this region. Top marks to whoever selects the staff and trains them.We will be back, and we'll probably have the tasting menu and some excellent NZ wines. Might even try it in the daytime to see what the view is actually like, not that it will be that important

We were interested in visiting the Marina Sands to see the building and wanted to check out the views but were not keen on the S$20 admission charge for the Sky Deck (especially given the weather was appalling the day we went). The solution was to head to Ku De Ta Club Lounge for a drink instead. Access to the club lounge is free - just get a ticket from the reception on the ground floor to go up in the elevator to L57. Once up there, the bar itself is a little shabby (showing signs of wear already!) although that is probably less noticeable at night, but the view is fabulous. There is an outside deck which looks over the infinity pool and has views over the city and the Singapore river. We thought drinks were reasonable given the location - although might start to feel expensive if you were staying for more than a couple of drinks. [Stella draught 0.5cl @ S$18; Glass of Chardonnay - S$25.00

I would like to personally share my experience with KUDETA.I visited the place and I enjoyed it very much specially their food and service. Their staff are very nice, cordial and excellent while their food are superb!Thus, I will certainly recommend KUDETA restaurant to all my colleauges who will be travelling to Singapore in the future.Keep it up and more power!Lulu Velasco - VELCA TRAVEL & TOURS, INC

We headed up to Ku De Ta for an evening of cocktails and snacks before we proceeded for dinner. We tried to get there before 6pm when the office crowd swamps the place on a Friday evening. Unfortunately, all the seating is reserved for club members and hence we had to take a standing table in the smoking zone, which too was beginning to get crowded. Firstly, the views are magnificent, you can see the entire CBD skyline and beyond. If you are lucky to get a seat next to the pool, you can enjoy those views too. Altitude and New Asia Bar offer similar views, but KDT takes the cake. We ordered two different types of cocktails and one wasn't available, which is surprising as it was Friday night and they barely had 10 cocktails on their list, so I went ahead with another one. The service wasn't of the standards that one would expect at such a posh place. One of the stewards was simply interested in helping a couple of girls with their photo-op, and continuously took pictures for them, at times even requesting other guests to move a bit to get out of the frame. I can understand helping out for a picture or two, but doing that for 15-20 minutes was a bit too much. Though, the drinks were served fairly quickly and were priced on the higher side considering the location and ambiance. I would recommend that whoever wants to experience KDT once, must do so, the views are quite good, however, try to get there before the office crowds come in. As for me, I will only go again when I have somebody visiting Singapore and wants to experience KDT, otherwise no sense in standing in a smoking zone and making way for people to click pictures whilst you are drinking cocktails

Average good with a concept that is neither here nor there. Fabulous setting.

We love a good degustation restaurant and don't mind paying for high quality food and service - this place is neither. Supposed to be a fusion of Asian and modern it was bland and boring but lets start at the beginning. There is a dress code - which is excellent - I tihnk too casual attire at elegant restaurants has become a problem around the world BUT when you require men to wear long sleeves and women to wear evening dresses and it is 36 degress celsius and 85% humidity the restaurant should be air conditioned. We were treated like cattle at troughs; with the layout squished in and continually hurried. Instead of each of our 10 dishes coming out separate 3-4 would come out at once. We were in and out of the whole thing in under an hour!!!! Not exactly the fine dining experience that this place portrays. Now lets get to the price $148 singapore = $120 Aussie = $115 US EACH mmmmm with no booze. For that price we have eaten some of the finest food in the world Neil Perry's Rockpool, Pesti Lampas, The Great Mellie, Pata Negra the list goes on.Like this whole complex -The Marina Bay Sands - its all promise and no delivery. save yourself $288 singapore and eat at the old chinese food hall in Chinatown for $8 for two

Go for the view but don't stay for the food. The presentation of the food and the view made for a romantic night and luckily I had good company. However, the food was over priced for the flavor and taste. It was decent food but not for what we paid.My tip is to go up for a drink at the bar (Sangria is probably your best best) and enjoy the view but no need to eat there

Went with friends to chillout at the Ku De Ta club on a Fri nite. Paid $50 for entrance fee that only come with 1 drink, which is extremely pricey for Singapore standard. The layout of the club only consist a handful of cocktail tables n sofas. As u could imagine, the setting was very uncomfortable, unlike other clubs or pubs I have been to. We asked if we could take the sofa seat since it was not occupied but were told these had been reserved. We hanged around at a vacant cocktail table instead. Interestingly, we did not see any guest taking up e sofa seat until about an hour later. When the guests at a nearby cocktail table beside us left, we moved to shift over for a better view but were stopped and informed the table had once again been reserved. When we asked why we were given the same advice earlier but did not see anyone taking up the sofa, the waitress told us this was reserved for VIPs who spend certain amount of money. We stayed on at our cocktail table and got another drink but when the drink just arrived, we were told we had to vacant the table immediately as their VIP is here. No alternative was given and when we asked if an alternate arrangement could be made since our drink just arrived, the waiter/waitresses simply shrugged and repeated that we need to vacant the table immediately as their VIP is here. Since there was no vacant table and having enough of the bad service in a night, we gulped down our cocktail and left while the malay waitress smilingly showed their caucasian VIP to our table. We felt like we were thrown out of the club like we were some lesser human being. When I remarked that I will share this unhappy experience on tripadvisor, the malay waitress had smugly told me to go ahead. We proceeded to the bar at Ritz Carlton and had a more welcoming experience there.Some advice to the Ku De Ta management:If the club only intend to serve Caucasians who open bottles of wine, pls remove the sale of $50 cover charge and make known such entrance requirement so that no effort need to be spared in throwing out your low expenditure guestsAnd for the travelers out there, the scenery is not fantastic and definitely not worth the monies. You could get the same view in all other high rise buildings in the area. Unless you are a Caucasian who will be opening bottles of wine, will recommend that you visit some other clubs or pubs so as not to ruin your travel experience in Singapore

was up at ku de ta, the latest in thing perched on top of Marina Bay Sands. cocktails were ok, music was decent but what was breathtaking is the view from the top and given the colorful landscape that was in place, it served as a good place for relaxing and just chilling out.Of course, if one is feeling lucky, one can always pop by the casinos just below for a quick game or two

Saw a pic of the outdoor part of the restaurant on a brochure and decided to book. Read reviews here after that, prior to going up, so we were prepared for a nice view and not much else. We were so delighted to find the food was lovely, staff friendly, and drinks amazing.....not to mention the view. The only thing that cuaght me off guard was finding that the restaurant was on the same level as the observation deck, so while most people dressed up for dinner, it wasn't uncommon to see someone wander past on the observation deck dressed in robe and slippers (from the hotel). The only other thing to mention for any gluten intolerant people out there (like me), there are items on the menu that can be done GF, but none of a page full of deserts could be - which was extremely disappointing, after seeing my family gush over theirs:

Last night was my husband's b-day and I booked in, with cake included. The place was mega-noisy because it was crowed, the table they reserved was in the middle of the rest inside, so less romantic impossible and the food (tasting menu) a real disappointing, so expensive and if you compare only the crispy baby squids and the "frozen angus meat" were great, the rest of the food i can prepare myself at home or buy it in the supermarketDetails below:crispy-sticky baby squid: goodblack pepper & lime drizzlesmoked eggplant & marinated salmon caviar: they served it in big pieces! vine-ripe tomato, smoky black vinegarspicy ‘bo ssam’ pork belly salad: megaspicy, am still in the toilethouse-made pickles, cucumber vinaigrette-sliced semi-fatty tuna belly, i can get it from cold storageyoung ginger, kafﬁr lime, green tea salt‘hot oil’ scottish salmon sashimi or fair priceszechuan pepper, dried miso, vanilla bean oilseared black angus beef tataki good: goodchopped nori, toasted buckwheat, green chili ponzu- pan-roasted foie gras & green mango pickle: terrible!sweet soya, puffed ricebamboo-roasted paciﬁc black cod: please somebody call Nobu!!whipped red misocrispy skin bamboo-steamed duck: goodkafﬁr lime & blood plum saucechar-grilled australian black angus beef tenderloinfresh green peppercorn & saikyo glazesteamed pencil asparagus the presentation of the dish?prawn ﬂoss crumblewok-charred cherry tomatoes & tofuspring onion & garlic soy-kdt ‘bounty’ cakedark chocolate, coconutsteamed palm sugar cake: goodsalted caramel mousseIf you are going to pay 500 plus for this bill: IS IT WORTHY? aaa they FORGOT MY HUSBAND'S B-DAYNo need to say mor

We went last night for a meal and it was fantastic! The food was amazing, definitely recommend the Australian Angus Tenderloin beef and Baby Squid! Our waitress Margaret was so friendly and helpful and explained the menu really clearly to help us choose from so many dishes! Special Merit to Margaret please!!Cocktails, wine and champagne were all lovely, try the 'Lady be mine'! Prices were usual London or 5 star prices that we expected and the bill was actually a little LOWER than we anticipated so please visit and see for yourselves. I can only think the bad reviews on here were merely teething problems from first opening. They seem to have really stepped their game up if what the other reviews read are true?! Thanks for a great night Margaret and Ku Dè Ta!!! We'll be back end of the week!!!

Given the Sands' outrageous design, we were very excited to dine at the restaurant at the top, Ku de Ta. the restaurant is mainly outdoor setting with a bar and tables set up - the view is stunning until the HORDES of people show up - when the bar got crowded we were shown to our outdoor table which soon was adrift in a sea of people heading toward the bar. The food was "eh" - the Australian beef skewers were kind of bland, the scallops were ok, my drink order was wrong, had to be sent back - it was so hot and crowded that visions of a romantic dinner vanished and we couldn't wait to leave. Our waitress picked up on it and said, "Too many people, eh?
1
It would have been interesting to have dinner with such a fantastic view, but we left and had dinner elsewhere. Why? Rude waiter and waitress talking about us behind our backs, presuming we would not understand them because they spoke in dialect. Too bad. I speak 4 languages, including Filipino, and 2 Philippine dialects on top of that. Even if I did not, it would not excuse rude behaviour towards diners. Not only was their English hard to understand, their rudeness made us lose our appetites
5
Top notch! The kobe beef was out of this world. 5 stars all over. The drinks, the service, the food, the little surprises. The wine is of course as you choose it, and very pricy too. Lovely. See you all maybe int he autumn....
5
In the past month I was at KU DE TA 2 times taking clients out. Everytime I've been there the food, service, and atmosphere were great. My guests were very pleased with the food (baby squid is always a favorite!) The staff was fast, helpful, and incredibly friendly. After dinner we head I usually head over to the club for some more drinks and music. Nothing bad to say about this place. All have ended with a great night
4
Ku De Ta is very good for lunch time. The restaurant is very lightful and the windows show the amazing view of Marina Bay in Singapore. I suggest the lunch after a pool mourning in the 57th floor of Marina bay Sands hotel.The concept of the restaurant is small portions served to share. We ordered 7 dishes, and all were very well made. The tuna, cod fish, chicken teriyaki, aspargus were all very good, with special star to the tuna and black cod fish.The wine list is a little bit poor, but i ordered a nice and vibrant neo zealand sauvignon blanc
2
I was really disappointed with the comprehension of the service staff as well as the service level. The atmosphere is great and nice, if only the service can match it. I brought a very senior guy from my headoffice to Ku De Ta exclaiming it's review only to be shamed and disappointed. Firstly, the service staff explained the concept. We accepted it, but we mentioned that for main course, we would like it to be individual because the senior guy, coming from traditional European country is not in the habit of sharing. The starters came all at once, and we shared. But the main course for two of the persons came and we waited for almost 15 mins for the 3rd dish to come, By that time, two dishes had turned cold. We tried to call for service to find out what took the beef so long to cook, while the lamb and king prawn were so fast? Couldnt they have waited for all three to be ready before taking all out? Or is it that the service staff do not understand a request that was made out of the norm? Never mind that, we couldnt get anyone to see us. Then the next table had to signal a service staff walking right past our table to let them know that we are looking for service assistance. The room wasnt crowded, there were many staff standing around, but no one will come forward despite customers calling. This is really bad!!!! even if the service staff was not responsible for the table, seeing that the service staff for the table is busy, shouldnt they assist? I question the level of understanding customer's needs and quality of service. This experience had spoilt the whole evening and even the food could not make it up for it. How I sang songs (even without going there prior to 5 June evening) because of the hype of advertising. How disappointed and embarrassed I was at the end of the whole evening. Seriously, if Ku De Ta wants to be the best in town, it has to start with the service, otherwise even good food will not be the saving grace because no one wants to be ignored in such a posh and exclusive place

I was recently lucky enough to secure a booking to take a client to Ku De Ta Restaurant at The Sands. This is not easy as demand is so high.The destination in Singapore is second to none with views of the City and local icons quite breathtaking. We watched the sunset from the restaurant and later reclined to the Club Lounge.The menu at Ku de Ta is a clever combination of tasting platters which can be served all at the same time or ordered for individual service. We chose to eat from the Chef's menu - the foie gras was delectable and a definite highlight for me, the service was excellent and we sat poised at our table by the window with views to the west and east.In addition to that we were very happy with the wine list which featured a favourite New Zealand sauvignon blanc "Astrolabe.It was difficult to extract ourselves from the venue and the views. I look forward to my next experience there.Jillian Clarke, Head of Marketing & Communications, Jones Lang LaSalle, Singapore

The view is the best in Singapore, staff are so attentive and very patience to answer all our questions, food was good. we went to the club lounge after our dinner, didn't know before that we could get free entrance to the club if you dine in the restaurant, then we ordered 2 bottles of Vodka, service was great because we didnt have to raise our hand to ask for the refill ice, refill mixers etc., rarely can see that in the other club in SG

spent only a few days in singapore, was a spontaneous last minute trip. kudeta was a memorable experience. Not only for the views, but the overall package was a highlight. the service was professional, shared plates were well balanced, but the desserts were the highlight of the meal. will go back for sure!!
5
I have been to both Ku De Ta in Bali and Singapore. I recently spent the most amazing evening at Ku De Ta Singapore, the service was amazing, the food was delicious. I love the sharing concept, its fine dinning but kept casual. I have been a number of times now and my last experience was by far the best. Myself and girlfriend had Salmon, King Prawns, Lamb, two types of Spinach. The Lamb melted in my mouth, the king prawn was perfect infact the eveining was perfect
3
for all the hoo haa that you need to have prior reservations weeks in advance for a table, we got reservations for the same evening for a table on the deck (these are harder to get due to the view).Service was extremely slow and harly worth the wait.the only part worth it was the Bar that they offer inside and out have friendly staff and a nice ambiance
3
This place is a must see - not for Ku de Ta but simply for the engineering and design of the whole Marina Bay and Sky Park precinct. Simply stunning!However, the experience is a little soured by the crappy "wannabe nightclub VIP" attitude staff. We went for a bottle of wine and some nibbles and wouldn't go back in a hurry. If it was the only roof-top bar in town then you'd probably put up with it. But, as there are other options, I'd give it a miss. Had pre-dinner drinks at Altitude the following night and enjoyed it. And you look down onto Ku de Ta from there! Now that's a serious roof-top
4
this is a unique place .....but you need to book in advance
Perry the Restaurant & Bar Manager does a great job welcoming and organoising people as it can get very busy !

I asked if the bartender can make a martini called the Black Martini. I gave instructions too - vodka, chambord and a dash of blue curacao. The waiter came back to me and said yes, but it will cost $60.00. The rationale? Because it has 3 types of liquor so they charge $20.00 for each type. This is a MARTINI that I asked for - not three separate drinks. There's more to math than "multiply by 3". A mixed drink is 100% in itself - and NOT 100% + 100% + 100%. I asked for the manager - who basically defended the flawed logic and offered no solution. Lastly, he defaulted to the position of "just follow law" - it's the management's policy. Shocking. Disappointing. To paraphrase a leading Singapore reporter - "first world facade, mud-hut mentality"
5
It was our 2 days stay in singapore and we heading to kudeta Bali. We had drinks at the bar and followed by dinner. Great recommendation on the food by her, great selection of wine by the sommelier. Slightly overprice. We enjoy ourselves very much and like to thank Renny Kessler for the great hospitality

I'm always a bit mistrustful regarding the super trendy places: usually the view, the service and the people are excellent, but the food is bad.I arrived on friday evening for dinner. The owner was at the entrance welcoming people. Good point. We had dinner on the terrace, which is really exceptional. View is superb, tables are nicely set, u got enough space to feel good and intimate but you're still close enough to others to see and be seen. Excellent DJ. Service is good. Wines and champagnes menu is incredible, probably one of the longest and most exhaustive I've seen. U'll find gems there. Only problem is that it makes the digestives menu look a bit short. The sommelier knows his job, u can let him choose for u.To the food now. My friend chose a selection for us, and I was really stunned. The food is fine, subtle, and excellent. I'd say it's in line with the spot and the view, which is as mentioned quite seldom.If I had to be super picky, I'd just mention the seats. Probably super comfy to lay on it, but not really to sit.Last but not least, I had the chance to be invited, so I havent seen the prices / bill but I'd suppose u wont go there if u're on budget.I'd definitely recommend it. Also heard they're launching breakfast. Either u have ur basic industrialized hotel breakfast, or u have a super selection there..
5
staff are very helpful and attentive - know the menu well, and the wines. Seek their help, as its a long menugreat atmosphere - lively inside, and chilled outside. One the bar side, get a table by the poolthe food is modern, but with an asian angle, bringing in the flavours from the neighouring asian countrie

I read all the reviews with a grain of salt and am glad we decided to go! We thought the service was fantastic! We did the tasting menu ($148pp ++) and it was great! The portions were big - we did not even finish everything. The outdoor seating was great! The one thing we did not like was the MBS observation deck right next to the outdoor seating (Not affiliated with restaurant). When they started charging to enter then people (dressed very casual) entered the outdoor restaurant walked in for a view and then left. For the money you spend on this restaurant I think they should have it blocked off so there are no outside distractions. Other then that I thought it was fantastic. We even visited the casino down below after to check it out. MBS is a very interesting place to visit
5
After nabbing a lounge on the city side, we quickly recieved recommendations for cocktails, the lychee martini's were stunning.The wait staff went out of their way to help with deciding on drinks, and even took the remainder of our martini's to ku de ta restaurant for our dinner reservation
4
We were first seated outside, but decided it was to warm and requested a table inside, which was very prompt. After being seated our first dish of baby squid Came out within minutes. We ordered a range of dishes but this one stood out to me. We were allowed tap water too, all you have to do is ask.Service was fantastic all night, with the lady in our area being an absolute delight.Food 8/10 service 8.5/10 decor 8.5/1

I went to Ku de Ta for sundowners with my husband and friend 2 nights ago and was seriously underwhelmed. The view is great, but then I could've gone to any other roof-top bar for that. The cocktails were expensive, as were the rest of the drinks, and weren't very good. My first one was the lime leaf and ginger Martini - it tasted of syrup and I couldn't taste any alcohol in it. The second was a lychee and rose Martini - described as having fresh lychees in it in the drinks list. There were no lychees in it and when my husband raised this with the waiter, we were told that if I wanted a fresh lychee in my drink I'd have to order a lychee Martini (not on the menu) which would be an extra 5 Singapore dollars. The waiter also said this issue had been raised on more than one occasion by other customers. Now I appreciate that the bar is trying to target the higher end of the market but at over 20 dollars (around 10 British pounds) per drink and 25 dollars for a drink containing ONE fresh lychee, I expect something a lot slicker, and the drinks to taste good. A customer at the table behind us had to ask twice for some crisps - admittedly these were complimentary, but why make the customer ask twice? We got ours just as we were ready to leave.Once I'd taken in the view, there was nothing more to make me feel like staying
1
Cannot recommend this restaurant at all, I didn't believe all the previous bad reviews so we just had to go to Ku De Ta to see for ourselves what we thought, now we wish we had heeded the advice given by so many before us - bad food, meals not served at the same time (2 guests only, not 20!!), poor service, vague staff, etc.  We were staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which is fantastic, Ku De Ta is a real let down for the hotel.Recommend to stay away
3
Very good place to have a restaurant but alas they fo not have a good menu. I had great time here but it would have been better had they really filled my stomach besides making me drunk. Very good service though.
2
We booked an outdoor table which was squeezed near the windows to the covered area in the middle so no view !Service was terrilbe and a basic meal for 4 with one bottle of house wine, 4 beers cost $890 !!!!. crazy for a meal with no view. Save your money and just buy a viewing ticket as its not private and people are wandering all around while you are having the meal.They even refused to change the forks, which were the only cutlery items. very poor
1
The food and service are awful. We asked them to book a table for tomorrow because we want to invite our friend but they said we cannot specify the table with view, they can just book a table for you and it can be anywhere in the restaurant. Ok then we decided to have dinner with them to make sure that their foods are good for our guests. And we found out that their foods are terrible. I ordered Hokkeido scallops for starter and spring chicken teriyaki for main-course. My wife ordered Vegetables tempura for starter and 40 flavours fried rice for main-course. All dishes taste terrible and unacceptable, scallops had an old oil smell, my chicken came with a lot of burnt garlic with strong bitter taste,regular vegetables tempura came with tasteless sauces and the worst fried rice came in lotus leaf that smell like spoil food. This was the worst meal ever for the unproper price of 200 SD with 2 glasses of wine. Besides you don't need to have dinner at the restaurant to appreciate the view. They got a very good wine list but over price
1
Place is a joke. Went on mother's day just to have dessert. We ordered $60 of desert, said we didn't need water (I have two kids, we already had bottles for them), we repeated said water wasn't necessary, then they came by without asking and started pouring us two bottles of small fuji water. I just laughed, this is so Singaporean. As soon as they poured the water without asking I knew the water would be outrageously expensive. . . $13 each, same stuff that is $3 in the 7-11.Then they took away our napkins and food before we finished. Then they had the nerve to chat me up about if I was visiting from out of town, etc. I could just imagine the management meeting about how they need to improve their reputation, but instead of better value or service they'd coached the staff to be chatted in a very rehearsed manner. ah, such is Singapore

On top of the state-of-the-art Marina Bay Sands Hotel on 57/F (aka Skypark), Ku De Ta was a dining experience to treasure, with clear blue sky and a refreshing food menu . It felt like dining in the clouds, with mouth-watering food and ice-cold drinks to pamper ourselves. Singapore is a busy city, but at Ku De Ta, it felt more like a relaxing resort with a huge swimming pool next door and a 360 degrees observation deck for drinks. Where else can you find a dining experience that is so unique. You don't need separate entrance fee to Skypark if dining at Ku De Ta, definitely value for $

I am on a two month working period in Singapore from Holland. Cominginto the dining area it is apparent that the staff are knowledgeableabout their services. When I was asking questions about availability oftables without having made a reservation neither staff members werephased in any way. From all staff there was a consistency the way theydealt with issues raised by myself.You could see this in the hospitality and in the service given. I wasmade welcome and appreciated the care given. No questions about the menuwere difficult.I even managed to drink a nice Dutch beer even though I did appreciatedrinking the Tiger before drinking the Hoegaarden.It was a great occasion and am hoping to visit once more before I leavefor the Netherlands
1
From most outside tables, you can not see the view and are bothered by lots of people just walking through. Their free dining concept (dishes come in any order) is terrible. We ordered 2 vege dishes to have with meat main, one vege came before starter and other 5 min after we had finished our main course. The wine and the foie gras I ordered had run out. Wine prices are twice any other restuarant in Singapore, and although there we a lot of staff running around, the service was not good. Go for a drink & the view and somewhere else for dinne
4
I had friends in town and thought I would try KDT but was somewhat wary of the mixed reviews of this new premier restaurant.We turned up early and took in the view which was very nice. By 7.15 we had done the obligatory tourist bit with our out of town friends but had some 45 minutes to wait until the table was ready for the 8.00pm booking slot. When we asked if we could come in early, this request was dealt with politely and they expedited a table for us immediately.Service was fast and efficient and when a dish that we ordered turned out to be not available, a free round of drinks came our way. This was completely unnecessary but a very nice touch.What really appealed about the evening was the sincerity of the wait staff, their eagerness to assist and how comfortable we were made to feel. For the record it was a Tuesday night, so arguably slower that a Friday or a Saturday. Food was pretty fine as well! I might also add we were very normally dressed in jeans and casual wear; some of the more "snootier" establishments around town can treat people a little differently if their dress does not necessarily reflect their perceived wealth! KDT, absolutely no attitude whatsoever; totally welcoming and sincere throughout the whole evening. I would count it as one of my better dining experienced in Asia in recent years
3
I went here purely for the view over singapore which for that it is unrivalled. You can look over the bay into the city and also have access to the sky deck so you can see the infinity swimming pool (though use is for hotel guests only).Drinks are very expensive at $22 for 1 beer/cocktail, though when you consider that you pay $20 just to get to the observation deck its actually a good deal. I Would recommend to get there circa 6.30 when it's light and stay until 8. That way you get to see the Singapore skyline over sunset which is a great way to spend an evening
2
I have always been a fan of Ku De Ta in Bali and will go there at every opportunity. Seeing the Ku De Ta in Singapore we thought let's go there. The view is fantastic, on a clear night the whole city reaches out beneath you. The food was really good - when it arrived. And, even though the staff were friendly, the service was abysmal. Their concept is that when the food is ready it arrives – OK, well and good, you might think. The waitress explained the menu (she was new) and told us the food was for sharing and which were the starters, mains and side orders. So we ordered our food – two starters, two mains and three sides (are you counting?). The food arrived in the following order. Starter, Starter again (the same one twice – we told the waiter we had already had our starter, but he left it any way – by the way they also tried to charge us for it too), Main course (Tuna – delicious!), Main course (Black Cod – well half of it at least), Side order, Side order, Min course (the other half!), Starter (erm yes a starter after the mains) – the eagle-eyed amongst you will have noticed that we are still one starter down; well, it never arrived!During the meal there was a great deal of ‘conversation’ with the staff and chasing of food and correcting the bill etc. To be fair the food was very good – but, for a place of this calibre I can’t believe that they can’t sequence the food to arrive at the right time – many lesser places achieve it. To call it a ‘concept’ seems to be a rather thinly-veiled attempt to spin poor service. Come on Ku De Ta – you are better than this!Go to Ku De Ta – go for the views, go for the cocktails. For me I am not sure we will eat there again. Dinner for two was S$240 (£120) not cheap
1
Great location but not a par with Ku de ta in bali there were too few staff and they could not care less about their clients ver dissapointing
1
Average food. Great views. Very very bad service. Would nt ever go back. Very rude
4
I've been there 3 times and loved it! Great location, great food. Brought my whole family and they were blown away. Food comes in nice sized portions - last time we went the waitress kindly warned us when we were ordering too much. The place has a great atmosphere - only spoilt by members of the public milling around outside on the viewing gallery, but you forget all this once inside. The view is the best in Singapore. The younger service staff need a bit of training, but the more snr ones seem on top of their game
1
Don't bother going here unless you are a multi-millionaire with no taste buds. I paid S$800 for 3 persons having the set dinner, and we each drank 2 beers and 1 red wine. The view is great, but everything else mentioned in the reviews is true, the seats are too low, the food is rubbish, the service just about passable, and the place is crowded and noisy like a food court. I only recommend to go here if you are single and then have a few beers at the bar.The only person enjoying Ku De Ta is the owner who is laughing all the way to the bank at your expense.Parking and accesability is another thing
3
You look up at the Sky Garden above the casino and hotel and it's impressive. Well you say, let's check it out. It's a pretty amazing concept with fantastic views. It's very cool and you should go, at least once. Apparently it cost $5.5 billion dollars to build (I watched a documentary on the inflight entertainment system on Singapore Airlines) and they need to get a return on their investment! It has eclipsed Paris as the most expensive place I have bought a drink - how about $SGD22 for a bourbon and dry! Plus tax! It's a popular place, and hard to get a table, but the smooth talking person I was with was able to lavish some praise on the 'Restaurant Guest Service Executive" - no joke, she gave me her business card, and we were ushered to a table. We had a selection of Asian foods from a tapas style menu. I liked the concept because I like to taste a number of different foods. The service was fast, that's because like to turn the tables over. You have to be spending up big to stay. Fortunately I wasn't picking up the bill. I've been there now, I told my friends, perhaps they will go once too. It's that kind of place. Worth going to - and only more than once if you've got stacks of money
1
How to talk about food when I wanted to sit down but was told I have no reservation when the restaurant is empty? The waiter brought us to the entrance to que again when we were already in the restaurant!! DUH?!! Sorry not interested in your food anymore!
2
The top floor entrance to the restaurant once you negotiate the Keystone Kop security is remarkably unimpressive, a sort of dingy corridor with the toilets on it. Of course once you emerge onto the roof the vista is simply superb. Enjoy it, it is about to go on your credit card!I can't disagree much with anything the previous reviewers have written - it's vastly overpriced for a noisy and uncomfortable room. The food isn't bad, we liked the duck and the tuna belly and the seabass; the scallops and the oysters were both a bit elderly while the Australian beef skewers could have been anything. All the portions are incredibly small - we were four and the three beef skewers weren't even enough to share. However the bill was memorably enormous to compensate.If you are a smoker you are in trouble. Unless you can blag your way into the bar further down the roof, you will be making the trip back to the ground floor. While you are back down, use the bathrooms there, there are almost none on the top floor, what there is is unisex and last Friday they were FILTHY
1
The view from Ku De Ta is fantastic. But that's where the positive experience ends. The service is slow, the chicken was gristly and undercooked, and the portions small and expensive. We ordered miso soup and it never came. After enquiring about the status of the soup, the answer was always "it's coming". 50mins later we cancelled the order.I will go back for the view and a drink but will avoid dining there again

I have been waiting for the opening of Ku De Ta and the Skypark for quite some time as I regularly travel to Singapore as a transit point to other places. I went to the counter at the atrium of the Sands hotel where Ku De Ta has a reservations person there along with security. I was told by the Security that reservations were not possible and I could come back at 6pm and I would be let upstairs. I did this and when I was 'allowed' to go to the top where the main reception was, I was told that Ku De Ta was fully booked for the night and a 2 week waiting list applied if I wanted to dine there. As most tourists and visitors to Singapore rarely stay more than a few days, I expect that there will be many disappointed potential customers who would want to visit this 'icon' which has been marketed so heavily of late.I could clearly see the restaurant and bar and for the size of the venue (could easily seat 200 - 300 comfortably) there was about 10 people at the bar (fully booked?). I argued the point a little with this in mind and was told I can have a drink at the bar, but I was not permitted to sit down anywhere as these seats were booked. I stayed from about 6.30pm until around 8.00pm and had 2 cocktails which set me back the best part of $40 each plus gratuity for almost non-existent service. There would have been 10 people at the bar, 10 people working in the bar and it still took me 20 minutes to be served on both occasions. I don't know what all these people were doing, but it certainly wasn't serving customers. Following this great disappointment, I left just after 8pm. By this time, there would have been approximately 50 people seated in the restaurant. Hardly 'fully booked' by anyone's measure! I could have eaten and left by this time and spent much more than I had at the bar. Obviously the management of this 'icon' is both inexperienced and incompetent and I doubt that Ku De Ta Singapore will succeed in the manner it's Balinese sister has. On the upside, I did avoid the $20 per person cover charge to enter the Skypark by going to Ku De Ta (more or less the same). A word of warning: The swimming pool which is on every tourist show and magazine about Singapore is ONLY available to hotel guests
3
I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and wanted to see how the hottest spot in Singapore looks like. The location is of course very cool since it is based at the SkyPark of the Marina Bay Sands. The view from 200m to Singapore's skyline at night is awesome. The question is whether paying 30++ S$ for a cocktail is justified. I think tourists should see it once and feel the atmosphere but then go to Clarke Quay. It offers much more for the money. And since many Expats and the coolest guys are around, make sure that you are not dressed like a normal tourist. I had to think very long before deciding that I should click the "recommed" button but one visit might worth it
2
Great view full stop you book and when you arrive there is no table, if you are not 4 you cannot have the view, the food is ok but no more, the service is bad and the hostess welcoming you consider you are nobody

decided to give it a try despite negative comments below.. and it turned out to be not a bad experience after all..i got an email confirmation within 48 hrs from the restaurant service team. and one of the girls called me on my mobile to double confirm my reservation for 4 that evening. i was impressed by the night view. it was a spectacular one. indeed one of the places to go to, if you wanna catch Singapore's skyline.it didnt take us too long to reach our indoor table. we were attended to immediately by one of the girls. the food in the restaurant is meant for sharing. you know how we girls are like, we love to eat, but at the same time watching our waistline as well. sharing concept is definitely something for us. food are served in relatively small portion. however, it's enough for the 4 of us to finish them all without wasting any food and fills our stomach nicely. (altho some of the items we had to order x 2 plates as there's not enough)new in the menu is the ohmi tenderloin and ohmi sirloin. we decided to give it a try. written in the menu, kudeta is the only one in singapore to serve ohmi gyu from takara ranch in central kansai jpn. for those who love beef, definitely not to be missed. dun miss the crispy baby squid as well.im impressed by the extensive wine list. but im not a wine person, so i gave it a miss. overall, it was quite a delightful experience. but.. i guess the price were a little on the high end side. the total bill avg to be about SGD$150 per preson (with a couple of cocktails).and we had to order x2 for some of the dishes cos there's not enough to go around for the 4 of us. maybe, it's not a place for me to go on a regular basis. but on once-in-a-while special occasion, i will definitely go again

A friend wanted to try it before she go back to australia so they had dinner there. Based on the reviews I decided to skip it and just joined them for drinks. When I arrived, I asked the receptionist if there is a reservation under the name xxx. After she confirmed there is none, she looked at me and asked if I am sure I got the right restaurant, then ignored me after that and proceeded to speak to the customers behind me. I know I was wrong because I found out that someone made the reservation on her behalf but the question made me feel stupid since there are *not many* restaurants on the 57th floor of MBS for me to mistake it. And if she smiled at least once, I would think she is kidding. Not sure if this is a factor but I'm a short asian in a decent tshirt and jeans.At the bar, I asked the bartender how much is the draft beer. He said $20 for hoegarden and $22 for stella. After ordering from him and paying by credit card, I found 1/2 pint hoegarden was actually $17.66 ($15+GST+SC). Not that I'm complaining but why does the bartender not know the actual price? There are 2 bartender, me and another customer a few meters away so I'm sure there was no rushing involved.As for food, my oz friend did liked her food and she said it was worth the price. But my other friends did complain that $16 for a bottle of fiji water is too much and the waitress kept on insisting they order water over and over again (no tap water). I stayed for 30minutes. Enjoyed the "atmosphere" but once the novelty is gone, nothing much to do as the drink is quite expensive. I also hate the idea of ordering draft beer at the bar and be charged with service when all the work needed is turn the faucet on/off... plus the fact that bartender's job is to do just that

Am a big fan of Ku De Ta in Bali and the Singapore Ku De Ta is equally awesome. The staff are fab, the food AMAZING (our group had oysters, pizetta and waggu beef burgers - all was delicious). And the views are just knock out incredible. Book ahead if you want to go to the restaurant - we couldn't get in. You can also reserve a table in the bar area which is well worth doing. They're pretty strict on dress code - so no flip flops, shorts etc

I was looking forward to my visit to the new Marina Sands Hotel - and was looking for a way to visit the infinity pool at the top. You have three choices:1. Stay at the hotel2. Eat at the Ka De Ta Restaurant3. Pay $20+ SGD to get top floor accessMy husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a lunch at the restaurant. We were well received from the bottom floor all the way to the top. The service was great as the staff was very attentive to their customers. Unfortunately, the food was not worth the prices that were charged. We opted for the set lunch menu (3 course meal) which cost us $45 SGD per person. The Asian fusion cuisine started with a tapas style appetizer of 5 little tablespoons of tasters (one bite each). I honestly don't event remember what it was. The rest of the meal was about the same. As usual, they charged very high prices for the drinks (in our case, $16 for a bottle of water).If it were not for the views and the access to view the infinity pool - I wouldn't recommend the restaurant. If you do go to the restaurant, I would recommend reserving a table with a view. There are only approx 4-5 possible tables (usually a table of 4) that have better views (but not full views). Otherwise - you don't get a window seat

I arrived to the venue around 10:00pm on a Monday night for a couple of drinks. There was no cover charge and I was instantly very impressed with the view of the Singapore skyline. The bar itself was also quite chic and modern. Being a monday night, the place wasn't very crowded so finding a table wasn't too much of a problem. I ordered 2 old fashion's to begin the night. The bill...$60!!!. $30 a cocktail is nearly double what I am used to paying for the same drink back home. Fair enough they did use above average grade spirits but that still did not justify such out of this world pricing. Not to matter though, if it tasted $30 then I suppose its worth it.... Did it? Nope. Nor did I expect it after seeing how they rushed this cocktail together...Next round of drinks was 2 gin and tonic. $44. Drink was ok but seriously, at $22 a drink?All in all, what first turned out to be a great first impression, ended up being a fairly expensive drinks bill

Our family of 5 came away from Ku De Ta utterly disappointed. We went with an open mind, all excited to soak in the experience that would be Ku De Ta. Our experience in Ku De Ta Bali had been wonderful and so we were terribly excited to have the same restaurant in our very own Singapore! The atmosphere up there was pretty okay but the views stunning. What put us off, essentially, was the poor taste of each and every dish we ordered plus the sad style of presentation. We've had amazing food around the world and to name a few- Hakkasan, Nobu, Kampa Park, etc. and the food is usually expensive but of extremely good quality and taste. I question the standard of chefs hired in Ku De Ta, Singapore and would never recommend this place to anyone. I request the management to respect their clientele by not serving them food that is below standard and of very poor quality. Sad to say, we had to come home and make ourselves eggs and toast for dinner

The view is stunning and the service is great and for that you are paying a high price. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the food, but also nothing spectacular. Unless you are on a spending spree in Singapore it might be worthwhile to consider eating elsewhere and just have a few drinks at the sky-bar afterwards..

After being very familiar with KDT Bali, a trip to Singapore had to include a stop at the "little sister"...what a disaster. We had no trouble getting a seat with a view (there were three of us) and that was the beginning and the end of the nice part...We sat and a waiter wandered over and handed a drinks list..my husband ordered a beer and a sprite for our daughter, i asked for a glass of savignon blanc and asked to see a wine list...No wine list appeared, instead the 3 drinks arrived including my glass of wine, which i had no idea what it was but it was pleasent enough. The waiter prompylt told my husband after placing the drinks down that it was $60. Ok we get that you are paying for the view etc etc. After the first drink my husband ordered a second beer and asked for a copy of the bill from the first round so we can claim...the copy of the bill came from the first round and it was in fact $56....we dont mind tipping but come on..this was pure theft!!! My husband asked for the change from the first bill, simply to have the opportunity to leave a tip, the waiter came back and literally threw the bill folder with the change in it at my husband. This was a RUDE, ARROGANT AND IN MY BOOK UNFORGIVABLE event. My husband has been in the industry for over 30 years and has never encountered such a thing. Overated, exhorbitantly priced and downright not worth it. I beleive the owners of KDT in Bali have nothing to do with this little rooftop disaster, which is good in a way but a terrible thing for the brand overall and i hope it doesnt cause too much confusion. My suggestion, pay to get up to the viewing deck and see the magnificant view but give Ku De Ta a BIG BIG MISS...

I had dinner over at Kudeta abt 2 weeks ago, my friends were telling me how great the ambience and service was.. To certain people the service was bad, but to me they tried very hard and spoke of the same lingo as each other. The service staffs were pleasant, spoke in a very well mannered altho I was quite demanding and ask for a lot of recommendation and question. I asked this sweet gal a question and she couldn't answer as she told me she was new. However she got me this pretty gal, dressed in black skirt suit, high heels who was able to assist me. She was very professional and answered all my questions. She made recommendation and spoke very eloquently of Kudeta and the food..well the only thing that pissed me off was the reservation process, i had to wait for 2 hours before i got a table.....horrible
