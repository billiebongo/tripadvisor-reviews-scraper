Went here for lunch, there wasn't much choice on the menu just 4 x sandwich options. The lunch set with sandwich and drink was ok and reasonably priced, but nothing special.

Great ambience and amazing dessert ideas. The banana pudding is a must try as well as the affrogato for an after meal compliment.

Our simple dessert experience here garnered a huge amount of facebook "likes", the presentation here was simple and wonderful and I can't wait to copy it at home to show off to my friends. Highly recommended for a simple yet elegantly cool relaxed dessert spot.

A hippy Korean dessert place for Bing Su and coffee.... Nice environment and good service... The pastry and drinks look interesting too...

The whole concept of eating out of a pot is the main attraction although to our delight it was the perfect portion size. We tried a few pots options as well as the Oreo bomb. The Oreo bomb was enough for two or three people and comes with almost a packet of Oreos. With a delicious generous serving of ice cream and marshmallows. The pot plants are like this soft sweet taste of chocolate or banana, espresso etc. Although small they are the perfect size. The cafe is situated in a nice part of Singapore and is well decorated and quite modern but most of all its in air conditioning which is an added bonus. Service is friendly and although they forgot about one pot I would still say efficient.

Banana tree cafe is a fantastic cafe to visit with your friends. The flower pots are delicious and the candy floss on top of the drinks does not disappoint! it has great vegetarian options but sadly not many vegan so i cannot go there anymore! if you can still eat there i would highly recommend making a visit!!

This is a nice little cafe, about 15-20 tables, operated by Koreans in Chinatown. It serves drinks, desserts - bingsu, cakes. Prices are slightly high, but it got great atmosphere and character. Cakes are rich and nice. Pudding cakes are very interesting - serves out of a small flowerpot! Coffee is good too. Definitely a nice place to drop by if you are around Chinatown area
