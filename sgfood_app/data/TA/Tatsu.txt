Good food, although the menu might not have specified exactly how much (pcs) you will get. It was rather quiet with few customers for a Friday evening prior to the festive season.
5
I recommended this restaurant for their excellent service and the quality of food are fantastic. My girlfriends and I enjoy ourselves at the restaurant.
Even though we were put in a private room, the service staff were very attentive to our needs.
3
I think the quality of the food was ok only. But the portion was quite small. Not worth the money we paid.
5
Empty restaurant at Asia Square on a week day. Feels like I booked the entire restaurant with all the staff looking after our needs
4
Our dinner cost $200 for 2 pax - we had a 300ml bottle of sake, sashimi moriawase for 2, a maki roll and 4 other small dishes. This isn't a refined Japanese restaurant but the quality matches the price (at least by SG standards!)
5
Came here for champagne pairing dinner. Very unique way to eat the sushi, sashimi, beef and Lam teppanyaki with champagne. Still find it to be better with wine. The manager - jack is helpful to make this an unforgettable event at $148 per pax is worth it. Food were tasted great and ambience is perfect for both business or family. Conveniently located at Asia square tower 2 and assessable by train or car. Perfect and I love the service and food!

It was a Tuesday dinner and when we enterted the restaurant, there were only 2 groups of customers present. The chefs at the sushi bar were making a lot of noise, singing with the group of customers at the sushi bar- making the atmosphere feeling uncomfortable and awkward. We had to wait 1 hour for our aburi sushi don to arrive (despite the restaurant being very empty)... food was average and the sashimi was sliced so thinly that the fish was almost cooked after being torched. Consolation factor is that the waitress did offer us complementary dessert and apologized for the delay in food and ‘noise’.
5
I looked at the menu online as they had teo locations, Chijmes and Asia square. I picked Asia square branch as it had slightly more items. It was a quiet, cozy and classy place. They had to areas, one teppanyaki seating area and sushi area. We sat at the teppanyaki area but we still got to see the sushi and sashimi menu! The sashimi was fresh and sushi was tasty. After which, they started cooking the teppanyaki items in front of us! Mr Kevin talked us through what he was doing and was very entertaining! The food was Super yummy! I highly recommend the prawns in garlic mayonnaise, lamb and scallops! The staff was very welcoming and helpful. I will definitely go there again

Terrible service was made up by Chef Kelvin at the Teppanyaki table putting on a great show for myself and my partner. It almost made up for pretty incompetent service and appalling wine list. The wine by the glass choice was only one, the bottles were $95 Oyster Bay ($10 anywhere else in the world outside of Singapore) so the best option was a bottle of Perrier Jouet. The allegedly fine dining restaurant then served Perrier Jouet (with it's very fancily designed bottle below) in Moet and Chandon glasses (see below). Moet and Chandon was not on the wine list. Every toast will have Moet and Chandon glasses in the photo, shared with friends, family and social media. The dining/waiting staff didn't seem bothered when I told them. Did Perrier Jouet supply their pretty cooly designed glasses to match the bottles (which I have had elsewhere)? Maybe they did and the staff just didn't care/have that attention to detail fine dining restaurants anywhere should have?You can spend millions of dollars on marketing, distribution and branding and then at point of delivery it's all screwed up by someone's incompetence/carelessness/lack of detail. People who enjoyed their night at this restaurant with champagne will look back at their photos and remember that great evening they had with Moet and Chandon branded Perrier Jouet champagne...... The design/layout is not very nice and comes across as cheap, the waiting staff are pretty useless and had to be directed and managed by Chef Kelvin who appeared to be running the place. Ask for him, don't buy the over priced wine and be wary of crap service

Fresh ingredients used, cooked to perfection and very flavours going through. To top it off, staff was very attentive and prompt in their service. Just go easy on the upsell from the chef as it can easily become a turn off.My partner and I celebrated a very special occasion. I wrote in to request for any simple arrangement but was turned down as it's only meant for birthdays. Well, how tough can it be switching from a birthday arrangement to an anniversary celebration. Will really appreciate a little more effort.Might be able to think about providing different sauces or condiments used. For example, before serving up the lobster, the chef can offer to diners if they like it with a creamy sauce or go with pepper and salt. Missing some final touches to this whole dining experience. With the price tag, many options are available and be able to match up the experience. Good food still, just missing some touches for me. I will call it good but not very good.
3
We had the teppanyaki during dinner time. There was only a few diners so we expected a exceptional good service and good food. But we were sadly disappointed. Service was slowly and the food is not worth the money.
5
We had our christmas eve dinner there and the food was great. Especially, children loved the fire show.
5
tasty depanyaki and servers are very kind.
Even though all sits are reserved, waitress make sits for my daughter and me. My daughter really wants to have depanyaki which is the food my family have on family vacation.
4
The sushis and sashimi go from good to excellent. The service is attentive and quick. Don't miss this hidden gem located next to the food court. A great option if you are staying at the Westin.
5
We've been here a few times now and always head for the teppanyaki. Our favourite dishes would be the steak, lamb chops, king prawns and seafood fried rice. I wish they would offer more options for dessert.
4
We had teppanyaki and omakase sashimi. Food quality was excellent and service was great. Sit by the teppanyaki counter to enjoy the aroma and watch fresh seafood and top quality beef cooked right before your eyes.
5
Excellent meal, slightly pricey but just the right amount of attention from the service team and teppanyaki chef made it very worthwhile!
The grilled pufferfish on the menu is a must try!
4
this place is always packed and reservations are pretty much a must. the lunch sets are decently priced given its in the middle of a CBD and attracts a business crowd. the food is above average Japanese for singapore and the bentos are decent value. have been 3x and will return.

We were here for business lunch. As business was brisk and we did not make any reservation, we were offered a table almost immediately but we would have to vacate within 50 minutes.We ordered Tara Saikyo and Teppan Prawn/Beef set. I requested for my prawns to be replaced with beef. The waitress was unsure if this could be done & told me to wait. Another waitress came to inform me that I would have to top up $5 for this request. My food arrived first but the restaurant served the wrong order for my guest. We waited another 10 minutes for her replacement. By then, my food was cold.My beef was quite bland, coated with too much oil & butter sauce. I asked for medium rare but got medium doneness. The salad & dessert were also run-of-the-mill. Total bill was $73 for mediocrity
5
My welcome lunch by my office friends was held in Tastu which is a block from our office in Raffles Quay. Their set lunches/bento boxes are excellent coming in a variety of meat and seafood choices. I personally enjoyed the crispy salmon skin temaki - something very unique and flavorful. Service is highly commendanle and persobalized. Reservations are encouraged as the lunch crowd comes in droves. Prepare to spend around SG$30++ per person. Will definitely come back
4
Enjoyed prompt service and vegetarian options for lunch with colleagues. Good range of sets and bento lunches.
5
The set is worth the price. sashimi fresh and nice . Value for money. Good place for family and friends gathering too
5
With our friends, this is our favorite Japanese restaurant in Singapore. Jack is a good old friend in charge and it is always nice to be around such people.
4
The teppan was good. Selection and quality of food is within expectation. Price was a tad high for ala carte teppan so should have gone with the sets instead. Service is excellent though. Wish they had more creative dessert options. Will definitely be back.
4
nice.. but over enthusiatic staff trying to recommend dishes and drinks
good initiative by a service staff to replace accidentally spilling guest sake... but no initiative by another service staff who spilled miso soup (which ended up on guest clothing) and made no "compensation"
5
Many times to this restaurant & enjoyed it each time I'm there. New & cozy ambience. Food & service is good too.
5
Enjoyed dining here. Great food, impeccable service that's attentive and not intrusive. Price is mid range but you do get value for what you pay for. Environment is not pretentious and combination of great staff, good food makes for an excellent evening. Will definitely be back !

I have heard good reviews about Tatsu for quite sometimes and decided to bring my friend there for her birthday dinner. We ordered the omasake sashimi, chirashi don, tempura, salmon aburi maki, cod fish and stir fried mushrooms. The sashimi is fresh and yummy. Tempura is okie nothing that blows de mind. The salmon aburi maki is a must try. Cod fish is good. My friend's favorite is the stir fried mushrooms which r really tasty!!! Will definitely be going back soon for another meal!!

Hear a lot of hype about this so I decided to give it a try. Table sitting was a little uncomfortable as they didn't have round tables so it was hard to make conversation more inclusive among the group. We've tried the Teppanyaki set and the food was good, although not very spectacular. The makis were quite disappointing as they've added in too much cream cheese and we lost track of what it was supposed to taste like. Some of the sides were decent, and Chirashi bowls were normal.Overall pretty average experience.
4
Absolutely loved the service here, the staffs are extremely attentive and engaging. The food was divine, from sushi to sashimi to unagi to beef teppanyaki, everything was just fantastic! The price is above average so I wouldn't recommend it if you're on a budget but if you're planning to pamper yourself and splurge, this is the place for you
3
Ordered the bento box and feels that I get what I was charged. Nothing more and nothing less. Accompanying soup is a little weak.
Will go and try during dinner time to check out the food quality.
4
Had dinner with my family of 4. Food is good especially the sashimi. The sushi portion is smaller than normal. Total cost was about SGD530/-.
5
Service was good and staff are very alert. The food is fantastic and the ambience made the whole experience a superb one!
5
Very good !!!! My family also likes TATSU because Sushi and Tenpura is very nice good. In addition, staff are also very nice service.

Went there for a birthday celebration. Ordered a set menu of chicken and ala carte main course teppanyaki beef. I'm not sure was it due to the fact that I just back from Japan holiday, that the bar of Japanese food had been set higher, or the food in Tatsu was just average from the beginning. Went to the branch at Asia Square.None of the dishes was able to consider as good. It was a weekday night, and not sure was it part of the reason why the restaurant was not filled (only 3tables filled, not sure about the teppanyaki side though)
4
~colleagues had lunch here in a private room for 10pax, the space is very limited within the restaurant and mainly filled with people who work nearby ~I would not recommend bringing family during working hours~an extensive alcohol & liquor collection is available to go with your meal~Lunch Sets are reasonably pricedBoth the sushi & teppanyaki food are goo

We were treated our first meal when we came back to Singapore and it was pretty amazing. There were 6 of us. We had a huge platter of sashimi and my favourite is the sea urchin uni and the akagai ark shell. Everything is very fresh and delicious. The toro also deserves a special mention. There was also a dish that I forgot the name but it was awesome, it was a special salad with tempura crumbs. Service was attentive and we had no complains overall

Main Sushi Chef, Sasaki-san has been in SIngapore for more than 10 years and he has created Sushi for many foreigners. To some traditional Sushi lovers, this might be too "innovative", however, if you are in the mood for lively and relaxing enjoyable night with "creative" Sushi, Tatsu is the best in Singapore. It is worth the price
5
Was recommended this restaurant for lunch when working locally in Singapore and it didn't disappoint. Excellent sushi, sashimi bento box which came with super fresh tempura and cleansing miso.The quality of the sushi and sashimi was superb. I wouldnt hesitate to return next time I'm in Singapore. I was very tempted to return for dinner, that's how good it is, at a reasonable price point

Stumbled across this restaurant, as I was looking for a restaurant in the CBD that opens at 11:30 am, and which is a proper restaurant, not a food court counter or hawker stall. The lunch food is better than average (which is a surprise, as the average quality of Japanese lunches in the CBD is not high), and it's not excessively pricey. Friendly staff. That's why it is packed solid a few minutes after 12:00, although its location off the giant Asia Square food court is kind of obscure
5
Back 2nd time with no regrets! The food was exceptional and enjoyed the recommended bottle of sake. A great place to bring family and friends for an evening dine out!
5
We brought our Japanese clients to Tatsu and we ordered their Set A & B dinner courses at the waitress's recommendation which were really good. Our Japanese clients commented that the 'food was divine and made him felt like he was back in Japan'....awww a home-sick guy. Our Japanese clients picked his favourite sake and it was smooth and to all our liking!We enjoyed the food and service other than the restaurant was rather noisy in the next private room...everything else was excellent!We will definitely be back again
4
...is the name of unfiltered sake and was really good. It's true a little be packed but the waitress was doing the best in the dinnertime without a reservation. What I recommend was marinated white tuna sashimi and softshell crab role and the sake with i
5
We felt like Tepanyaki for dinner and found this place via a web search. We had some excellent sashimi and a set Tepanyaki course. The chefs were entertaining and very knowledgeable about the food and their craft. We had a brilliant night and will be recommending this place to any of our friends traveling to Singapore!

Came here with a friend for lunch today and had the sushi set at $28++. I'd say the sushi quality was ok but certainly not exceptional. The tuna and the mackerel weren't great, but the salmon was quite good. I also liked the miso soup. I was a little disappointed with the service staff who kept trying to up-sell more expensive off-menu items (e.g. today an offer to try some special scallops for $50, or to have some icecream to complement the dessert already in the set menu). The place was totally packed at lunch and I don't think we would have got in without a reservation
4
Went for dinner before counting down to 2015. We ordered Teppanyaki Beef Set with additional Silver Cod, Seared Salmon Roll. The beef was cooked till medium rare. It was soft and easily chewed. One of the most tender beef that I had. The silver cod and seared salmon roll were tasty too. Both chefs were friendly and chatted with us. Service was good
4
It was our first visit to this restaurant and we were impressed with the service and the dishes we ordered. We were the first customers when they opened for business at 6pm and we were privileged to be showered with attention from the waiters. We ordered a la carte and our favorites would have to be the salmon maki and gyuniku tataki (lightly seared beef). Definitely a restaurant to visit if you are into japanese cuisine

I like the cozy intimate decor... Perfect for a friends get together or family.. Or a casual client lunch or dinner.I was there for lunch on a week day afternoon with a client..Food menu is excellent... I am vegetarian... Nice veg options.. I wish there were more( not appropriate to actually even ask of this in a japanese restaurant though).... wine menu is pretty decent... Understand that their sakes are well chosen as well..given my lack of knowledge... Had some good sake... Pricey sakes...Set meals are at about sgd 25-30... Its always the booze that kills you in singaporeImpeccable service as i was with a regular... Friendly staff for sure.... Great ambience.. Packed at lunchhour.... Nice vibe..Sure it would be great on an evening as well.. Even better perhaps.They have a private room for 8-10 with minimum billing.An indoor place in an office complex, so no outdoor seating..

I had some guest coming from France with kids and wanted them to experience some japanese cuisine! I made reservations and requested for some entertainment for the kids and they delivered. The service by the staff and the waitress was impeccable. We ordered several maki and a few sets of their teppanyaki. The maki was beautifully presented and tasted so fresh. There was a hint of floral in their sashimi which i loved. The Teppanyaki chef had really impressive knife work and display skills, he interacted with the kids and played fun games with them, making their experience with this "new" cuisine the highlight of their trip. The food was just great, the beef is excellent and the prawns in garlic mayo is our fav!!I definitely recommend coming to this place and i've done so several times. You won't regret!

The food was good and i was happy with the selection and service was very good too. A lot of food and I'm vegetarian and still a lot for me to eat as well. Nice place :
