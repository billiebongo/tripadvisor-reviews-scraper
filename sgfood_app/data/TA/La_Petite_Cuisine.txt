This is truly a place you can find affordable and tasty French food in Singapore. The wine is also at a very good value for money price , truly a gem In Singapore.

La Petite is Singapore’s affordable, approachable, laid-back French restaurant.The sauce in the escargots (6 pcs) with croissant and salad is almost as delicious as the escargots themselves.In this age of Intagram, it might come as a surprise, then, that the most brilliant dish at La Petite is also the downright ugliest. To roll out a cliché: Looks aren’t everything. I had the Confit de canard w/gratin potato. Damn, it’s a good dish, both thrillingly new and comfortingly traditional.La Petite doesn’t blow you away in in the same way that other spots like Les Amis do, nor does it intend to. It’s an assured, steady-handed restaurant. Tres bon, La Petite, tres, tres bon. This is the true truth as I say it as it is

Was brought by relatives to this cosy neighborhood cafe, with French owner chef. Found the food of a high standard: including the foix gras salad, mushroom soup and the duck confit. Prices are reasonable & portions largeProbably need a local to take you there, as it's in a fringe Bukit Timah locatio

Affordable French food. Excellent value and good service. Shows it doesn't have to be fine dining to be good French cuisine.Set dinner was excellent value. $40 for 3 course meal and the portions were normal sized and not shrunk like some places when you order a set.Wife had foie gras as started which was very generous and nicely seared on outside and soft on inside. And no supplemental charge for set. Mine was prawn and foie gras ravioli. Again very generous and creamy. Wife had duck leg for main and mine was yellow in tuna steak. Again generous and delicious.Even the $12 house pours were decent enoughMuch recommended

My wife and I visited this place for dinner on a Tue night, around 6:30pm.Location and Parking================+ Conveniently located within 5min walk from Botanical Garden MRT station.+ The restaurant is located inside Serene Centre (a small and aged suburban mall that's a fav haunt for students from nearby). There is a small mall basement car park, but the rates are not cheap:MON-SUN before 5/6 PM: $1.80 for 1st hr, $1.80 for subsequent 30min from 8am to 9.59pmMON-SUN after 5/6 PM: $1.80/entry from 10pm to 7.59am the following dayThere is limited free streetside parking along Jalan Harom Setangkai in front of the landed properties.Layout and ambience===================+ Air-conditioned+ Fairly spacious+ Nice touch with paintings by famous French artistsFood====The restaurant is well-known for offering affordable French fare for the past few decades.Dishes we had:1 complimentary bread bun per pax. It was so delicious that we requested for another. The Indian waitress was kind enough to waiver the additional charge ($1).Escargot Bourgogne (6 pcs) with bread and plenty of salad ($16) - the escargot has been extracted and stuffed into the croissant bread. Coated with delicious gravy.Confit de Canard (i.e. duck confit) with creamy gratin potato side dish ($17.50) - The meat was soft enough and the skin was crispy-tasty. Portion was not small and big enough to fill us up.A week-day-only 3-course set dinner meal ($26.50) comprising:1. Mushroom soup (or you can choose goat cheese with salad) - big and scrumptious bowl2. Pork loin cotelette with sphagetti - pork could have been softer, but it was chewable. Generous portions of meat and sphagetti.3. Any dessert from the dessert counter (we chose the cherry tart, which was actually big enough for 2 pax)In general the ala-carte appetizers prices range from $7 (salad with French dressing) to $14 (chicken liver salad) to $19.50 (foie gras with orange confit). Mains range from $15 (ham and cheese omelette) to $17.50 (Crb meat sphagetti) to $29.50 (Mignon of veal tenderloin and chanterelle).There is also a 2-course week-day dinner meal option ($22).See attached photos for price menu of all food items. + No GST tax and service charges+ Definitely cheaper than more posh restaurants without losing the food quality, which was delivered by authentic French chefs+ We didn’t order wine. Cold water is avaible via self-service dispensers and plastic cups.Service=======+ I was expecting poor service based on the reviews by previous customers. However, the Indian male waiter and female cashier who served us were polite and accomodating. Food was served within 15min. So no complaints there.Reservations - I had tried to make a reservation half an hour before arrival, but the lady who anwsered the phone said I need not as there were plenty of spaces. That was indeed the case when we arrived.Overall, an afforable, delicious and well-portioned French meal

Let me first say that when they opened, my family were fans of this place. We even accepted the whole brusqueness and curt fast service as very "Parisian" and didn't mind it one bit for pretty decent French food at great prices.But one evening we had an incident that probably ended whatever good vibes I had of the place. My family went there for dinner. And in the middle of the meal, my wife noticed a huge stain forming on my father-in-laws shirt. And to our horror, there was oil dripping from the ceiling onto his shirt. When we alerted the wait staff (there is this one chap...you know who you are), when we told him, he curtly said "he had told us to sit a certain way". None of us remember him saying so. The thing that baffles me is if he knew one of his patrons was sitting there being dripped on by oil, and not say a thing? Worse was his reaction after I ask to speak to someone other than him. He was plain rude and thought nothing of his behaviour. Wasn't great. My f-i-l had a plane to catch and had to board with an oiled shirt. Food's ok. Owner came out and was much better about the whole incident. But experience at Le Petite completely tarnished by this incident. Needless to say they have lost us completely. The oil and stuff I can take. The reaction UNACCEPTABLE! You've been warned

This is the third time I went to this restaurant with a different group of friends. I love food and like most of my "foody" friends we have been to top restaurants around the world. I lived for many years in California, New York and Europe, and I am an amateur chef my self. In few words, I am very knaowlegable about food and appreaciate places where food is good and honest. La Petite is exactly this place in my opinion. Be aware that it has a concept of ordering and paying at the counter, which migh annoy some "snoby" customers but makes the process cheaper and simple. Always the food is extremely tasty and you can sense the freshness of the ingredients and the quality of the preparation. I write this review because we all felt so happy yesteray with our dinning experience and felt that I should spend the time to write a review.We tried the baby rack of lamb, the scalops, the beef tenderloin, the foie gras, the raviolis and the tuna. All these were spectacular for the quality and their reasonable price. Food is definitly french but it is light! no just heavy butter and cream to make it tasty, but a smart use of olive oil, light cream, milk, etc. I find the foie gras to be very serious in this place (unexpected for such a small resautant in Asia). This time they used a different sauce than last time, and I could taste orange, a great combination. Goes great even with one of the cheap wines. So yes, food is tops for the money and concept, comparable in quality to the 2x expensive places in Singapore. The service is definitly not bad, people are happy to serve you and do their best, especially in a very busy night like yesterday. Of course, this is not the place to go and spend 3h on dinning and sipping cognacs after. It is meant for a hapy experience that is consistent with the fast pace in Singapore.We definitly will go back soon! It is definitely my favourite place in Singapore

After one year, I have decided to try this restaurant. And it was a good surprise - weordered saumon and dory fish, the taste was really good ... and price not so excessive. Good place for a quick dinner (restaurant started closing after 9:00 pm

Always wanted to try this place but some how always got in at the wrong time being crowded and had to skip it.Finally got a chance on a Sunday evening .The carrot orange soup is good. Fell instant in love with it at the first taste of it.Ordered the salmon fillet for my main course.Loved the butter flavoured rice . It complimented well with the salmon. Would be nice to have a little more of the rice.. felt that the potion of rice was too little for me.. I am a big fan of eating lots of rice The Best thing is that La Petite does not Charge service and GST. Staff were friendly and helpful .Definitely will return to try other dishes on the menu.

I am MOST displeased with the service provided.
Breakfast was supposed to be served at 8.30am, but the counter was not even ready to take customers.
Menu is not clear.
Bread was not tasty; hard even.
NO WAY am I ever stepping back here again.
5
Went with family, ordered duck, tuna, foie gras. All very good.
Service is ok unlike other reviews may have said. Self service for drinks and the orders. I like it this way better.
2
The place is decent, nothing to complaint, but no more than that. Service is deficient, not bad but rather plain. On the food side... dishes are very small and though taste is good, they simply don't compensate for the price. I ordered a salmon fillet with spinach and rice; I'd bet the dish dis not have 100 grams of fish in it. Definitely not comming back
4
Love the place, take circle line to Botanic Gardens and just 8mins walk to serence center. They have set dinner which make the whole complete meal a lot more cheaper! the food was really good it's my first time there and I love it.. the service staff was friendly and very engaging to talking to u and ask about ur day :) would recommend this place if u wanna impress ur date and save ur pockets :

If you like fuss free french cooking, particularly from the Alsace region (very different from southern french cooking) at a very reasonable price (for singapore) then you can hardly do better than this place. Ample parking, bistro style cooking, order and pay at the counter, then food is delivered to our table. We have been several times and the food is very consistent. its not earth shatteringly good, but its always very decent and the price is reasonable. Easy sunday dinner

I went to La Petite Cuisine in Serene Centre with a group of friends on a Sunday afternoon. Some of us ordered Salmon & some ordered Duck Confit, both are priced at around S$15-16, which are considered very reasonable for the portion and quality. My salmon was quite a thick fresh filet and the skin was superb, very crispy. My friend commented that her duck confit was very well done. May, the lady boss cum chef, came to chat with us while she took a break from the kitchen. She is such a friendly person who takes pride in serving good and fresh food to her customers. This place is unpretentious with simple decorations and yet very cozy. I would highly recommend this restaurant to people who like French cuisine at reasonable prices
5
We had delicious dinner. Food is not most refined or "best ever" but a good quality and well worth to go for good family style traditional French food (such as confit de canard, ...). Also the restaurant offers a very good price quality ratio. No service charge, no GST. They use a strange and unfair Singapore loophole but 17% less is noticeable on the total bill. Staff is very friendly. Red wines are served too cold to my taste and the restaurant could be better updated / decorated. You eat under bright fluorescent lighting, plastic table cloths, white floor tiles = canteen style. But all fits together quite well and we left as happy satisfied guests. We had good food and enjoyed our dinner.

A great low leyed simple place with very nice French food at crazy cheap prices. We went there with another couple and as always the food was great. We had yellow fin tuna, seafood pasta, an Alsatian sausage and ham dish. They have a good wine selection and you cn bring your own for a modest corkage fee. Nicest people. Love this place Very hard to find something like this in Singapore. Goof French fare can be very very pricey here. I will be back..Worth trying. See for yourself. Nout sure how they manage to offer this food quality for these price

La Petit Cuisine continues to be very tasty. I ordered the duck, which was crispy and not too hard, just the way I like it, and swimming in delicious sauce. The creamy potatoes are okay, but I found them slightly flavor-lacking. Their bread was delicious too, soft and yummy. Their mushroom soup is not so flavorful as the duck, though I enjoyed their onion soup.I find this restaurant great and I will come back here for the duck again for sure
4
We've been here a few times over the years from the time they were just a hole in the wall restaurant with a few tables and chairs. No matter what we've ordered it's been great. It's always busy, and you need to order and pay up front inside - so don't expect much in the way of service - but it's all about the food.Tables and chairs can be a little uncomfortable if you're planning on sitting for a while, and they could do with some outdoor fans, but again, it's about the foo

We stopped by before visiting the Botanic Gardens, and were pleasantly surprised on the culinary options, mostly French of the place. The duck was amazing, the salmon was also very good, and the Dory fish quite nice. It was a but pricey, but worth it.
5
I had walked past La Petite Cuisine for years before finally eating there and now am kicking myself for wasted opportunities. The service and decor are not fancy - you order at the counter and pay in advance - but the variety and quality of the food was fantastic and it was really good value for what we paid. My children loved it - the menu has a couple of simple dishes and lots of good options for those beginning to enjoy adult flavours (as well as those who have been enjoying them for years!). Highly recommended
5
I tried almost all the meals off the menu and all of them are great . Not just once but every single times . The staff is friendly the food is amazing and it won't damage your wallet too . Simply the best place to eat .if you close to botanic garden mrt don't miss it

Arrived on a rainy Sunday evening at 2015h, the restaurant closes at 2130h. There were 2 other tables occupied and the patrons were midway into their dinner. We were promptly seated and given menus, and informed to order at the counter. They do not accept credit cards here, please take note. There is no service charge or GST either. 'Specials' are written on a large chalkboard next to the cashier/ordering counter. We decided on the Confit de Canard (Duck Confit $17.50), Chicken Filet ($15) & an appetiser of Escargot (6pcs $15). They do not serve water here and a bottle of water will set u back $2.50.We were served a roll of bread each with unsalted butter. The bread was sadly NOT warm and the butter was frozen. We decided to put it aside and have the bread with the escargot sauce. Unfortunately the bread was cleared away before we had a chance to protest when the escargot arrived. It would have been appreciated if the service staff had asked, before taking the unfinished food away. The 6 pieces of snails with sauce served in a buttery pastry (I wouldnt call it a croissant as it was advertised in the menu) with a side serving of salad. The salad was fresh and lightly dressed which complemented the savoury sauce that the escargot came in. I would give the dish a 7/10 in terms of appearance & taste. Our main courses arrived 5 minutes after the escargot, and they got cold pretty quickly :( The chicken filet was served with a mushroom cream sauce which was not too heavy and a portion of rice. The rice was lightly flavoured with ?butter which went well with sauce. The chicken breast was lovely, tender and moist. 8/10 for me :)The duck confit to me was that star of the meal. With its crispy skin and tender meat, it was an absolutely delight. It was served with potato gratin (which could have been served hotter) and a brown sauce which went very well with the meat. This dish deserves a 9/10. Sadly, the meal was marred by the service we received, clearing plates whilst your customer is still eating and reaching over the table and in front of your customers while they are in the midst of a conversation without even an 'excuse me' is NOT the way to go. At 2100h, while we had finished our food but was still chatting and having our drinks - the waitress announces from the cashier, 'Sorry Mam, the restaurant is closed.' It was quite a turn off as we had only JUST finished our meal and the sign on the door CLEARLY states that they close at 2130h. The service here gets a 5/10 for me. And as my dining partner very cheekily reminded me, I didnt pay for service so I shouldnt expect any :

I was wondering what to eat but I found la Petit Cousins down Serine Center.and it was good food and a friendly chef owner May And Bernard.a friendly staff and the Price was okay this is Singapore so l even expected that maybe expensive like many other restaurants here..I had the Salmon with rice which was lovely.
4
Every item we ordered off the menu was at least satisfying. In particular, the confit, escargots in croissant, salmon with cream and a beef dish (I can no longer remember how it was served) were very tasty. While the service in general was average, the chef did approach us to make sure that we were satisfied with the food
4
I brought my nephew to this place to show him that French Cuisine need not burn a hole in your pocket. We had foie grass - done just right, yummy,The chicken liver salad with lots of greens - delicious the daily special - beef steak medium rare - exactly the way he wanted.Portion generous.Another daily special - crabmeat spaghetti - this is average.Service not 5 stars but friendly
4
Visited for quick dinner.Ordered;Onion soupFoie grasBaked EscargotHam spaghetti in cream sauceItems came promptly, if not all together.Taste was on the dot. Presentation was fine but obsessive use of the same rocket leaves and dressing in almost all servings made it a little boring. Still it tasted great!The hot buns at the start could've been nicer without the frozen butter portions. Servers were hasty in the service as usual so take it to heart that it is relatively cheap for the fare served.To repeat visit and try their Cunard
3
Although the sign on the door says 'French Bistro', you will not find a bistro like this anywhere in France. The dÃ©cor is extremely spartan. It is almost self-service - you choose and pay upfront at the cashier's, and help yourself to water. With (too) many pasta and rice dishes (as well as some classic French ones), the food is more cafeteria style, or the type of home-cooking that you find in busy French families where both parents are working. But it is well executed, most dishes are satisfyingly good, certainly better than those served at hypermarkets' cafeterias in France. And prices are very reasonable, so it's good value
2
I live more or less in the neighbourhood but hadn't eaten here in a while. I used to know it for affordably priced, decent french-type fare. My experience this week was very disappointing.The service is as mediocre as ever, almost brusque or rude. The food is now seriously over-priced ... and the portions very small. The pasta we had was more italian style than french.Sad to say, I don't think there will be any future visits. There are other French bistros in Singapore now in this price range which offer more and better
5
Tasty French cuisine at reasonable prices. Service could be better, but the food bill does not automatically include service charge like most other restaurants.
4
Attentive and friendly service coupled with excellent food and wine! One of the best places to have French cuisine in Singapore!
Would recommend it for anniversaries and birthday celebrations.
4
This is a great little restaurant that is no frills, just patio seating with a few indoor tables. The food is good quality & has authentic French flavors at a reasonable price. It is a great place for a quiet dinner with no nonsense.
4
Love the escargot croissant, and dory dish. Place is small so it's first come first serve. Good value for french cuisine.

This is our second attempt in dining at the restaurant. The first time, it was full. Today, we thought we were lucky when we walked into the half full restaurant. We went up to the counter and told the staff there "table for 6 pl". He continued his work and did not even look up or acknowledge our presence despite it not being crowded to the extent that our voice would have been drowned up. When he finally did, he told us to sit outside even though there were 3 tables of 3 and one table of four empty. We asked if we could take those tables and he said spilt into two. When we requested for the table of three and four which were next to each other to be joined, he refused. Then, another table of four freed up, and he again refused to join the table. When we asked why not, he just glared at us! This is so strange, ESP pinoys are generally quite good service staff! Sure pissed us off enough not to want to eat there! Who knows he may spit into our food!!! No wonder the restaurant is half empty this round - probably thanks to him
1
Used to be cheap and quite nice. Now not so cheap and absolutely awful.. And i'm not difficult. Service is non existent, rude, and pressing. They served the main courses before we finished the starters.Food eaten : warm goat cheese (cheap packet st marcelin) on toast with plain salad. Good, cant miss that. Ham and cheese omelette with plain salad. Ok. Hard to miss. Boeuf bourgignon: a disgrace. Beef dry.. Sauce burnt and tasteless. Choucroute: a joke. Dorry with basquaise sauce: blend.. 2 soft drink and a beer. Total 130 dollars.. A shame to french cuisin
4
I agree with most reviews that the food is excellent and enjoyable at inexpensive prices. As the restaurant was only half filled on a Saturday lunch time, we were served quickly after having ordered and paid at the counter. The French chef even had time to come by our table and asked about the food (we ordered escargot croissant, spinach ravioli and fillet chicken). Service-wise, if you are prepared to overlook its lackof (especially there is no service charge on the bill), this is a very good place to enjoy French food. We will be back
1
We went on a late Saturday night. It was still crowded but there were available tables in the 'garden' area. The staff brush us off by saying that section was closed. We were seated along the walkway; Small table and dark corner. Food is cheap by Singapore standard but that was all there is to this place. There was no service to speak of but of course they can justify themselves by arguing that there was no service charge anyway. The foreign elderly chef/boss came around to say hi but with no genuity. When we told him a certain dish was delicious, he didn't even blink an eye to see which dish we were referring to but merely said 'Thank you' and walked away. The final straw was when some Caucasians came, they were given the 'garden' tables. When asked why, the obnoxious chef said, "Does it bother you? It happens. " I would not go to a place just because it offers cheap food and yes, it bothers me when yellow skinned customers are treated badly. I would not visit the restaurant again
4
The 'Indie' French place to visit. Very good no frills French, the menu is pretty simple- appetizers, mains, desserts and help yourself can-drinks. Very nice Duck confit and Escargot croissant (must try) at it's price. Perfect casual afternoon lunch hidden gem.Don't expect too much from the service since it's so cheap.For more detailed review and photos click:http://sethlui.com/review-on-la-petite-cuisine

I've been coming here for yonks and particularly like the gratin. Their gratin has just the right amount of cheese and sauce and is just excellent. I usually change my salad for the gratin and sometimes even pack home a side of gratin. That said, I have eaten a lot of the dishes at this place but think that the duck confit, foie gras, escargot croissant and the pastas are very very good. They are always just the right serving amount and piping hot.I'm not sure why people complain about the service: this establishment doesn't charge service charge has quite a simple set up - you go to the counter to choose what you'd like, make payment, take your drinks with you and then, your food will be served to you. Considering how inexpensive the dishes are, why is there an expectation of service
4
Enjoyed the choucroute very much. Not easy to find that dish in Singapore. Unbeatable value fir sure.
3
This is my third time visiting this restaurant. Overall they serve great food and it is cheap but a major turnoff is that their customer service is the worst!
4
Nondescript dining place, very laid-back and casual atmosphere but amazing duck confit bowled me over. Have recommended this to many friends and also brought my family to their branch near upper thomson road, which served food of a similar quality at affordable prices.
4
A short distance from the Singapore Botanical Gardens Bukit Timah gate and Botanical Gardens circle line exit, this is unpretentious French food at its most affordable! We were there on a Sunday evening and the friendly(!) French chef was at the counter joking around with us. (Later on, when it got busy, he went to work in the kitchen.) We had duck confit, spinach ravioli (S$11), prawn and foie gras ravioli (S$15), sirloin and the pork chop with pasta dish. They serve nice warm buns and butter for starters. Orders came amazingly fast! The servers were sort of stressed, and it took a while for our dishes to be cleared so they could serve dessert, but it was easy to overlook. Sort of disappointed that the ravioli dishes were on the sweet side (was it the cream?) and the pasta wasn't homemade. Then again, it's a French restaurant and not an Italian one! It's nice to sit in the "downstairs" area as the servers call it. The al fresco portion "upstairs" can get busy with people passing by. Then again, you don't get noticed by the servers that quickly if you're downstairs, so that's a trade-off. Will come back again for that excellent, affordable duck confit + potato au gratin
4
It is a small restaurant, with only a few tables. You have to order and pay inside and after you sit inside or outside (that's why the waiters do not come to take order, it is a semi-self service restaurant). The tables are simple, but the food and the service were great. The Chef walked around and asked everybody that the food is good.The value for the food was very good at local standards, so if you are in this area it worth to eat a lunch here
4
Despite what the other reviewers say about the service, have found the service to be OK - not fantastic but nothing to complain about. After all you need to keep in mind the 'sidewalk', semi-al fresco nature of the restaurant and the value prices. If you are seeking four-star service, go to a proper restaurant. Food is pretty good and keeps me coming back

Their main outlet at Serene centre has received significantly better reviews than this place and I can finally understand why.Be prepared to receive worse-than-expected service here as the glum-faced servers seemed unhappy to have customers entering their territory. Do not expect them to guide you to your seats or take your orders. Water is self-service.Dishes which you can only find here includes this Croissant with Escargots (13.50) which came in a satisfying portion despite being an entree. The fluffy warm bread stuffed with big fat chewy escargots was doused in that delicious mushroom garlic gravy! The idea of croissant with escargots is really a wonderful change to the usual garlic and butter type. I am really curious about the escargots here because they are one of the largest I have tried so far. For other food like seared tuna with rice and desserts , check out : www.dairycream.blogspot.s

I have been to La Petite Cuisine several times as the restaurant is near my kid pre school. Great value and try the chicken, beef and pasta. Very simple setting. Best of all; the food is very nice. You will love this place if you like casual french dinin
4
A quick note in support of other contributor comments: the food is sooo much better than the setting!!! In fact it is sufficiently good that the worn plastic tablecloths and the steady flow of after work commuters brushing past your table seem somehow to fade into the back of your consciousness as you sip your wine and savour what has been set before you. As for the mood of the staff...aren't all the French like that???? In our case the ageing and very handsome chef with the tired eyes and well loved moustache wandered out to ensure that all was in order...we felt chuffed and well catered for! As for atmosphere, there was none, beyond what the customers themselves might lend. A great little place

We've visited La Petite Cuisine a few times recently. And what a great place for casual dining. The food is excellent and very reasonable indeed. I love French food but don't like the stuffiness and formality that sometimes comes with it when you go to 'fine dining' establishments. It's just my preference. Which is why I think La Petite Cuisine is perfect for me. Inexpensive tables set on the walkway frontage of the Serene Centre and a few inside just in front of the counter make it very informal and relaxing. Order and pay at the counter and the staff bring your food to your table. A warm bread roll seems to accompany each main course. We've had the steak and potato dauphinois a couple of times and the confit de canard. Both delicious. Mains are extremely reasonable at around $15 - $18. I had a 3 cheese plate for around $14 on one visit which was just what I needed!Think the owner chef makes the place run really well. Delighted we have found it. Much as I love Asian food, sometimes a quick, simple and inexpensive French bistro type meal is required!!!Well done to everyone. Highly recommend

Really cheap French food.
Excellent value for the price.
There used to be a restaurant but it closed down.
Some tables are outdoors where it can be quite hot.
Can get crowded.
5
Prices were fantastic for Singapore standards. Foold was delicious. This will definitely become a regular dining location.
4
Whilst it is located in a " mall" with outside seating ( total capacity about 20 ) the food had turned out be very authentically French ! We had the duck confit and it was as good as the " upmarket " restaurants without the price tag. My daughter love the ravioli ( whilst this may not be a French dish ) and the plate was clean by the time she was done with it. Will be back for my French fix !
4
if you craving for french cuisine with affordable price and good taste :) you should come here... with only SGD 12 you can get 6 pcs of escargot placed within croissant, and the croissant was soooo good, it absorbed the juice of escargot. Another thing according to the title I made in this review, they have a special Duck Confit with Gratin. The duck was crispy outside and very tender inside, also the gratin as side dish was very moist (creamy and buttery) soo.. if you only think about good and yummy food and don't mind with a simple environment, very standard service , then you should come here :
4
First off, you come her for the food alone. Service alternates between very surly and friendly depending on the mood of the servers. There's no atmosphere- you sit along the corridor. But, the food alone is worth coming back for in spite of everything. Portions are small, but prices are low so can't complain there. My fav is the duck confit. Surly service can be a bit off putting, but the food n prices sort of make up for it. If they could just be a little friendlier it would really make it a more attractive dining option
5
So okay it's a bit dodgy where it is and there isn't any ambience. It is between a barbecue joint and a doctors office and if you choose to sit inside you are basically in a corridor. Out on the verandah is a little nicer but still nothing flash.. The food however is as good as it gets..I went with my wife and 2 children, My wife had the sirloin and cleaned the plate as did my children, one had the chicken the other the spaghetti..I had the chaucrette. It was a huge portion and I couldn't finish it. It was fantastic and at SGD$19 a bargain. i have paid SGD$80 for similar meals in club street which weren't as good.. We had desert and the creme brûlée was as good as I have had anywhere..despite being in a foil tart container. We got there at 5 and were served promptly and engaged with some banter with the chef who was up for a chat. We finished the meal and went for a stroll to walk it off. Upon our return at 7 ish the place was packed..I mean people lined up waiting..They will also happily do take-away..

We went on a Tuesday night at about 630 p.m.. There were seats although it was filled up quickly by 7p.m.We had a Rivoli, a sirloin steak and a duck confit. The rivoli was really good, with succulent prawns and a creamy based sauce. Steak was very well done, cooked to the right tenderness with a simple sauce.Duck confit was a little oily though crispy on the outside and tender inside! We loved the potatoes sides which were creamy and buttery. The bread that came before our dinner was warm and beautifully done! Overall, it's a place that you can come for a simple dinner. It costs us about $40 odd and the food was quite good for that price. The servers were not very friendly though, but I think there wasn't much of a service required as you order at the counter and have to get your own water at the counter too if you want

Situated in an unexpected location, this tiny restaurant offer generous French dishes at a very affordable price.What I like at La Petite Cuisine, is the low cost concept of the place: there is no service at the table, you order and pay at the counter and you eat on a very simple plastic table cloth. This is really unusual for French restaurants which rather want to have a upper-class image. People usually queue to try one of the delicious traditional dishes made by the experienced French Chef.It is the moment the try what you have always been dreaming about!The Half Dozen Baked Escargots served with a Croissant - $13Pan Fried Duck Foie Gras with Orange Confit - $18.50Chicken Cepes with Buttered Rice - $12.50The portions are generous and sincerely delicious.When the kitchen close, the Chef comes to the room and chat with the customers finishing their diner. The ambiance is friendly and warm hearted.To conclude, this is a place to go for french people missing their home-sweet-home cuisine!To have more reviews on french restaurant, visit my blog: http://www.frenchrestaurantinsingapore.blogspot.com

This is not a fancy place, it just serves good French food at very low prices (by Singapore standards). The chef should be awarded for bringing the wonders of French cuisine to the Singaporean masses. He is more deserving of a Legion d'honneur than Salma Hayek or any of Merkozy's pals.With the new MRT station at Botanical Gardens it is now accessible to those that do not live in the neighbourhood or do not have cars

This was our second lunch at la petite cuisine. We liked it so we came back!! The low cost concept where you order at the counter, pay first and then eat on a plastic table cloth with plastic plates at the back entrance of a small shopping mall could surprise some customers with even low expectations. However once you have accepted this fact and that you have tasted some of the fine dishes listed on the tiny menu it is likely that you will like it and come back. Raviole with foie gras and prawns, dori fish, large scallops with baby spinach and duck confit were all very good
