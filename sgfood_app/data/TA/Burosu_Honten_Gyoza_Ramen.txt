It’s soooooo good! Must order Ultimate ramen, add egg and seaweed! Noodle texture is just nice and springy. Seafood is fresh and portion is generous. The best part is the soup!!!

Been eating this since they opened their business in Singapore. Should have been a few years for now. Love the thickness and firmness of their seafood ramen. Price is reasonable and service is rather fast. Do try it if you drop by the area

If you’re looking for a fancy ramen experience this probably isn’t for you. But if you want an honestly good ramen with a very nice soup quality, nicely cooked springy noodles and pretty good quality pork, this place should be what you’re looking for. The ramen isn’t fancy but it hits the spot and is really quite tasty. If you like your ramen spicy as we do it is genuinely spicy without ruining the sauce flavour. The portions are very good for the price. They also have very good special offers every month. In the January we visited, they were giving away a free appetiser with every ramen ordered, and there aren’t just small free dishes on offer, like you’d find in most other places, we had a chicken karage with 5 large chicken pieces, which was great value. The beers they serve here are also nicely poured draughts, so you’ve really got everything you need for a great quality ramen meal at a very reasonable price. The only thing I think his place doesn’t need to do is the exotic variety of ramen flavours they try to introduce now again, we tried some other specialty flavours once (I think it was a Singapore chilli style ramen) and it wasn’t as good as their classic tonkatsu. Besides that, this is one of our go to ramen places so will definitely be back again soon

After reading some mixed reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. When the ramen arrived, I must say, it did not look as good as some other I have seen. But the it passed the taste test with flying colours. The broth is unique in that I could taste both the rich tonkotsu as well as a strong seafood (shrimp/crab) influence. The noodles itself was just right and the aji tama was perfectly done. 3 relatively thick slices of chashu made off the meal nicely.The gyoza is one the best I have eaten anywhere.Prices are a bit high compared to Keisuke, but cheaper than Ippudo

I know I used to say Tonkotsu Kazan Ramen was the best ramen. But that was before I had tried the ramen at Burosu Honten Gyoza and Ramen. The ramen at this place wins hands-down in terms of ramen texture and the amount of ingredients added.Actually, this is the last of the Emporium Shokuhin restaurants that I visited since the place looks kind of unassuming, like that little humble izakaya hidden in a corner to be forgotten. Well, looks can be deceiving, and the crowd, in the midst of the quiet Marina Square, hints at what this restaurant have to offer. And very good ramen that is.One of the highlights of this restaurant is that the patrons can choose to have their ramen prepared according to their preference, meaning there are options on the texture of the ramen, the taste of the broth—ranging from light to heavy and the spiciness. So you can order your ramen exactly the way you like it. Even though I chose the light broth, it is still very tasty, saturated with seafood flavour—since I chose Ebi Ramen. Add a tad bit of spiciness for kick, the soup blew me away the first time I tried it.The ramen is very springy, soft but not soggy—perfect texture, I must say. Not many places can get this right, not even Tonkotsu Kazan. And I love the generous amount of ingredients added, ranging from three huge prawns, fish cake, pickles and finely chopped spring onions. The prawns are very fresh and succulent, not surprising, considering that Emporium Shokuhin has live seafood section. Oh yes, I had also tried the Kani Ramen, and I'm so pleased to see huge chucks of fresh real crab meat sprinkled on the top of the ramen. So do they taste good? Well, of course!My companion tried the Tonkotsu Ramen and the one with Black Garlic, and he absolutely loved them ... and still loving them now. I like the unique flavour of the broth with Black Garlic, it is a ramen with a twist.The service is pretty good, with consideration on the price range of the food there.Among all the restaurants in Emporium Shokuhin, this one got to be most wallet-friendly. And it is the one that impresses me the most. Then am I going back again? The truth is my companion and I visit this restaurant so often till some of the staffs recognize us already

Great Ramen place, refined menu and easy to order. The soup is delicious and the meat is tasty. Had the Tonkotsu Black Garlic Ma-Yu and it was amaze-balls. My colleague accidentally circled the wrong choice and doesn't eat prawns... they changed the dish with no questions and without charge; very generous of them and much appreciated.

After shopping at Emporium Shokuhin, an upmarket Japanese supermarket in Marina Square, our group of four comprising my parents and my wife, had our lunch at Burosu Honten. The restaurant was empty as we had arrived before the lunch period. However, by the time we finished our lunch, the restaurant was filling up with customers.We ordered their specialty ramen and adapted them for our personal preferences. The broth was tasty (we had opted for less salt) and I had to caution my elderly parents from enjoying too much of it! The ramen portions and ingredients were adequate although we had expected more for the higher prices charged. Still, we had an enjoyable meal

There we were wandering through this great Japanese supermarket and then we find this great ramen and gyoza restaurant. We chose a variety of different gyoza and other delicacies. The prices were reasonable, the service was efficient and the food was really great. Best prices so far as Singapore food is definitely overpriced compared to other countries. Must be the tax! We went back twice

Had their Special Ultimate and Tonkatsu Shoyu ramen, fried pork gyoza and Goma salad. My wife found the tonkatsu ramen average. The special ultimate ramen and goma sala were quite good (I chose normal salt and little spiciness for the ramen). Gyoza above average. You order meals by completing individual order form then you will be billed before your meals are served.I guessed the chef recommendations like the special ultimate should by your immediate choices if you want a more enjoyable mea

Learnt of the new Ehime super blend and their wagyu gyoza with their homemade sauce. Both were amazing. The super blend ramen was so flavourful and the wagyu gyoza was juicy. Love the wagyu gyoza especially, as the sauce complement very well with the gyoza. We also had the moyashi (marinated beansprout), which is so addictive. Love this place and their little window concept. Always the best place to come for a casual lunch or dinner with friends
