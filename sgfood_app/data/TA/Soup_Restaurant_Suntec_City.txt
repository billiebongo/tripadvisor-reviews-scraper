My wife and I caught up with Singaporean friends for a wonderful Chinese New Year lunch.
We had a variety of traditional Chinese dishes. All were wonderful.
For a taste of Singapore I recommend the Soup Restaurant.

Very nice, clean and peaceful place. The food is good, especially the soup and salads.
Unfortunately the staff is extremely slow and careless of customers.

Only the chicken dish with ginger is good. Unfortunately many times when we ordered the chicken, some parts of the chicken were bruised with blue black.
Other dishes are below average.

If you love perfect tender and juicy chicken with the best ginger sauce you could imagine then this is your place! Again a true asian place so don't expect windows, nice service or a humble aircon...

Repeat visit. Like their booth area though a bit tight. Great ambience and service. Food was the main reason we were back! Don't miss the clay pot tofu and pork ribs

The Samsui ginger chicken is worth the visit, along with some other great dishes. Friendly & prompt service in a pleasant environment, although as with any mall restaurant the sense of arrival and place is diminished. A shame I could not get a glass of wine

We visited on a Saturday evening, which is understandably a peak for the restaurant. Unique thing was being asked to place orders while still standing in queue outside the restaurant. Efficient, yes. Considerate, maybe not. Fortunately we are regulars at their other outlets so we decided fairly quickly. Inside, the atmosphere is not unlikely a bustling teahouse in Hong Kong. Staff rushing around, diners chatting loudly. Hardly tranquil. Decor however is befitting a Chinese restaurant and very authentic.We enjoyed the signature Samsui Chicken. However they managed to mess up our order and serve the chicken only after we had completed the rest of our meal. The sweet potato leaves were stringey and hard to chew, Steamed SanYu Fish Slices were plump and wellcooked, Spicy Beancurd was surprisingly very flavourful. The Ginger Rice with extra ginger is always a delight. Overall service was slow but an amicable auntie made sure our tea was always topped up, which made our day.A good place for good food. Maybe on a weekday instead

My partner and I were looking forward to eating at this place because it served sweet potato leaves (Fan Su Ye). After a short wait to get a table, it took almost an hour to get our food. We enquired about our order numerous times but the staff were vague and unapologetic. They seemed to be understaffed and those that were there were poorly trained and poorly organised. The food, when it finally arrived, was OK but it didn't offset the poor service and experience

Miss having all these traditional Chinese food of long past which is found in this restaurant made in the most authentic manner. Everything that we ordered tasted great and I love the ginger sauce especially and which they sold in bottles. We bought 6!Service was prompt and food arrived fast. Price was reasonable. Recommended to come to this Chinese heritage restaurant which is available in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.

We brought our overseas guests here as they preferred Chinese food.All the dishes we selected were to our guests' liking.We selected half a Samsui Ginger Chicken (which is understandably their specialty dish). Their portion was more than adequate for 6 adults. Somehow, the moist and juicy chicken pieces pair so well with their ginger sauce, with a piece of crispy, crunchy lettuce to wrap up these pockets of tasty goodness.We also ordered their Double-boiled American Ginseng with Baby Abalone Soup (with Pork Ribs) which came with a whole baby abalone in individual bowl servings. The soup was also well prepared, in testimony to the name of this chain of restaurants = Soup Restaurant.Next was their generous portion of tender Steamed Red Grouper fish slices with spring onion and ginger.We also enjoyed our dish of spinach, together with salted as well as century egg. This combination makes for a tasty vegetable dish.All these medium sized dishes were good accompaniment to bowls of fluffy white rice.Their barley drink with good portions of barley (in hot or cold) was refreshing.The bill came to around SGD120, for 6 of us.This is rather reasonable for good quality, satisfying Chinese food in a cosy and comfortable restaurant ambience.We saw many local families, colleagues and even overseas guests at this restaurant.Recommended for decently priced rustic heritage Chinese cuisine in this area

The food was good, on a busy day, the Samsui chicken, pork, vegetables, there's a new floral tea smells real good and the taste! Give it a try!
4
The service was good and staffs were very attentive to customers. The atmosphere was suitable for gathering.
4
Food was good and service was great. Suggestion to have tea pot placed at table so we don't need to keep asking for tea refill.
4
The waiter and waitress were very attentive and helpful. Love the way how they take the extra effort to interact with the customers.
The leather seats' were peeling off and not in a good condition.

Yesterday went to Suntec Soup Restaurant for dinner with my family. The potato leaves were so salty, Tofu prawns very salty, ginseng chicken soup very salty, lotus root soup ok, Chicken ok. I think not worth the price.
4
The Soup Suntec offers a refreshing change in the sense that many of their staff including the seniors can and will speak to you in English when taking orders. The food is great and a stroll around Suntec afterwards to help with the digestion.

Went with my ex colleagues and we had a great meal with some special requests as one of them is a vegetarian.The young guy service staff was extremely helpful esp when needed the dishes to be prepared with meat or soup stock (meat was used for the stock). Dishes was served fast...hot and delicious. Will definitely go again.. has always been one of my favourite restaurant

Had a hard time locating the restaurant itself. Thought it was at the B1 roundabout (where the Suntec fountain is), however it situated at the stairway (next to food republic, DBS ATM machine) area. So be prepare to factor some time to look for the exact location.Food was fantastic- as it always did. Service was prompt. But didn't really like this uncle service staff who replied in a sarcastic manner when we asked for red cut chilli Other than that ambience was good, clean place

Soup restaurant is now really poor value for money. Soup Restaurant had expanded the menu to incorporate Paradise Inn favourite dishes, but in doing so, they need to compensate with the increased costs by reducing portions. 1 soup, 1 half chicken and 1 stir fried fish dish cost almost $100. Used to be decent price for good food. Now it is exorbitant price for marginally good food. The ambience is a little nicer after renovation at Suntec, so the extra costs also goes to rental and recuperation of their renovation expenses

I visited this restaurant as i have eaten it a few times when i am in singapore.The ambience is very chinatown which is good.The famous food is the hainanese cold chicken and soup of the day.Service is average, not attentive and we were forced to pay for the peanuts and cold towels which i turn should be complimentary and we were not told that we need to pay.SGD100.00 for a meal like this is too steep.

Ordered set menu for four pax. The waitresses looked like they were middle aged but they were professionals who know their businesses.
Food portions were big for four of us too.
4
We went to the IMM, Jurong East branch for dinner while we were there. We ordered a tofu Prawns gravy dish and ginger fried rice. The portion sizes were good and we liked the taste, mildly spiced.
5
This was a great find in and amongst lots of places to eat.
The food was delicious and fresh and well cooked. The staff here were friendly and so helpful.
Definately worth a visit.

Good pick for veg sandwhiches . Good value meal . Pumpkin soup is recommended. They offer various set meals.

Excellent Samsui chicken on lettuce wraps, and unpretentious local dishes that will appeal to all 3 generations in the family;- grandparents, parents and kids!!

We have dined at this chain of restaurant many times especially at Paragon (more central) and the airport T2 (no crowd). We always go for the set meals as we find them value for money. Good quality food and substantial for the Asian families even though the portions may look relatively small at first

I went there in a group of 13 and they offered a "private room". It wasn't a private closed door concept but more of an area partitioned with ornament displays. The furnishings gave off a truly Chinese vibe. China vases and paintings were on display and staff were dressed in a perfect blend of modernity too. It wasn't over the top and was really easy on the eyes.What took away 1 star was that there wasn't a dedicated staff to each "private room" and it took some effort to get the staff's attention. However, they made it up with great advice during our ordering process and friendly service throughout our meal.For our food, we had a few of their signature dishes and yes, they lived up to expectations.... namely samsui ginger chicken, ah kon potato leaves, and hometown fried fish belly. They were tasty and didn't leave an after-taste or taste artificial, as some would. Other dishes that I particularly enjoyed are their claypot tofu, cereal prawns, newly included steamed hand chopped minced pork pagoda with salted egg. I totally recommend ordering a bowl of rice to slurp up the savoury sauces.Be forewarned that they are known to have 30 min queues, so make reservations if you're heading there. Fancy seeing a group of Japanese having a meal there on a weekday... looks like there's truth to that claim

Came here for dinner with some friends. We made sure we had reservations on a saturday night. Food was delicious especially the Samsui chicken, braised tofu and steamed pork pancake. Their fried rice and Hokkien noodles were also delicious. Atmosphere is also nice and comfortable to catch up. Service is also very good
4
Must have it Samsui chicken with the ginger sauce. A light and delicious dish. Another must have dish is the simple Sweet potato leaves. Comes in simple ginger stir fried or in spicy version. Prefer the spicy version. Dishes that reminds me of home cooked dishes

Couldn't find the IMM branch one. Samsui chicken: 10/10 (Especially with thr ginger sauce Sweet & Sour pork: 8/10 (Crispy and full of flavour) Other dishes likd the sambal potato leaves and some other veggie are okDont bother to try their "Beggar bowl toufu" its tasteless to me Service: 8/10All v polite got say thank you, enjoy your meal sorry to disturb etc in Chinese. just that waiting time v depressing when you are hungry. didnt order their father's day deal, too expensive. Main thing is their samsui chicken have to emphasize its rly delicious with the ginger sauc
