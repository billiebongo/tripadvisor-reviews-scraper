It was a random pick to dine here but was never a regretted one. It was a celebration of birthdays in advance. Indeed we enjoyed the dinner. Some photos on the dishes we had for your reference. Hope you will enjoyed too. Like the stir fried squid on rice.

I'm not a fan of Korean cuisine although I've tried them many times in SKorea and Indonesia. I noticed that this restaurant is often crowded even on weekdays. My family went there twice in the last few weeks. Last Sunday we ordered the ginseng chicken, my favourite Korean dish, beef short ribs and seafood pancake. The ginseng chicken soup tasted flavourful but the chicken meat was a bit over-cooked. The seafood pancake was too starchy for me. Our order was taken by the lady boss whom many customers find friendly and loves to baby-sit other children. Overall, it was a good experience for me

Located in a buzzy suburbian spot within the North-eastern part of the island, this unique, authentic Korean restaurant serves a vast variety of delicious Korean dishes.We tried the Hanwoori Set 1 & Jajangmyeon. Both were delicious. The Jajangmyeon was nicer than most Korean restaurant we tried before.It's worth patronising this spot.The Korean restaurant Lady was very friendly, the staffs were helpful, attentive and quick in their actions

One of the gems of Serangoon Garden. Those who've found this korean restaurant will find themselves coming back, as can be seen from their queues on weekends.The korean lady boss is super friendly and treats every customer as her friend. She'll even sit down at your table for a chat and her great personality makes it an even greater experience as a family restaurant.Like most korean restaurants, they'll serve the free flow korean side dishes.They have a huge variety in their menu, so you'll have a lot to choose from. And to be honest, almost everything I've ordered from them so far has been good, so it's worth trying out whatever appeals to you there.For me, I like their kimchi pancakes. I also like their beef short ribs and meat platter, served on a hot plate. I also like to order their beef bulgogi, or their spicy squid. All are served in very generous portions. My folks love to order their chicken in soup each time they go; they swear by it, saying it's really good too. Be prepared to wait for a while, especially on weekends. The queue starts quite early too, as is the same with most of the popular places in Serangoon Gardens. Also, the staff can be overwhelmed at times on weekends as its almost non-stop action for them, so be nice; most are just students trying to earn some extra cash

Overall, it's a pleasant dining experience at Hanwoori.Wide variety in terms of menu. While portioning for the side dishes seems small, servers were very happy to refill at every request. Food tasted authentic and home cooked. Service was warm and friendly. One of the servers even took a picture of us to paste on their 2016 visitor wall. Will definitely revisit to satisfy the kimchi craving ;

Authentic home-cooked korean food that is cooked to order at reasonable prices.Plus points: - Friendly lady boss (Joy) who will sit down and get to know her customers. She absolutely loves children and will help babysit if she isn't too busy.- Free refills of side dishes- Free hot/cold korean teaExercise lots of patience during peak hours ( especially weekend dinners) as staff may be overwhelmed. Make reservations in advance to avoid waiting in line

The three of us had lunch at this small restaurant and had Buchujeum (chives pancake), Galbi Jjim( beef short ribs), Ojingeo Bokkeum (spicy friedsquid with vegetables) with rice.First came 10 mini dishes of assorted kimchi.As this is a small family run restaurant, you knowthere is no mass produced dishes. Dishes will beindividually cooked to order.The taste of the dishes are authenic as they are cookedby a native Korean cook.I found the Korean chives pancake to be rather thin.The beef short ribs were flavourful with thick beefon the ribs. However, I found the gravy to be toosweet.The best dish was the stirfried spicy squid with vegetable,with generous beanpaste chilli. However, the dish does nothave enough squid but was overwhelmed by the vegetables.Food quality : 5.5 out of 10 points.Service was prompt & polite.Payment : Cash & credit card. Nil NETS payment facility

My friends and I decided to try this restaurant at Serangoon Gardens. The restaurant is on the same stretch as OCBC bank. It is good to make advance reservations as many of the tables were reserved when we got there. The lady boss is korean and is extremely welcoming. It is child friendly as well as we saw many families dining there.We ordered the chicken hotpot for 4 to share. The korean rice cake and pancake, all for sharing. It came up to about 30 dollars per person. Each of us had a drink as well and probably over-ordered. In ny opionion, it is rather affordable if we were to have one main course each

Noticed the restaurant for sometime, finally decided to go there with my wife and kids for Saturday dinner. Located near the OCBC bank.Friendly staff, efficient but can be a bit more attentive. Lady boss very cheerful and outgoing, zooms into the restaurant on a kick scooter.All the various food we tried were good, especially the beef BBQ. Only dish I recommend you to skip is the spicy seafood soup, not much ingredients and not value for money.Pictures from 2 separate dinner occasions

Had a farewell dinner there. Located at serangoon gardens, near the famous food centre "chomp chomp".Open by koreans, offering authentic korean food. 10 side dishes comes with every mian dish ordered. During my visit, we tried the ginseng chicken and the burise pork which goes very well with the plate of home made kimchi and fresh greens. It is a must try.Their rice drink is also awesome, but it may need some getting used to for people whom don't like seeing rice floating around in their drinks. Price is above average. Staff is friendly and helpful. You can also ask for re-fill of the sides dishes. I love their anchovies which is fried with garlic and sprinkle with a bit of sugar with a faint spicy taste.Generally the embiance is relaxing, a great place to have some quality dinner time with love ones
