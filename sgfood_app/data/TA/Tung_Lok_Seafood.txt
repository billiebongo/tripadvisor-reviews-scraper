The presentation was sloppy and the seasoning was a little away from perfection. The quality of the food was so-so but the manageress knew a thing or two about customer services. Not sure if I'd eat here again.

Good food and service :) Thou it was a little pricey, but it is worth the experience to try it with friends/family!
5
The buffet is very good. I love the sashimi and my nephews and niece love the fish skins. All food are served hot and the serving size is just nice. Lots of variety to choose from. I love the lemongrass jelly after my meal too.
5
Had the buffet lunch. The salmon sashimi is very fresh. The staff is attentive and fast to meet our needs. Place becomes noisy when the lunch crowd comes in.
4
Good value for money. We have upgraded the ala-cart buffet from $38.80++ to $58.80++ for more varieties.

Service was abit lacking but it was still acceptable.. food wise, we ordered a crab that is 1kg but it’s so small, looks only like 700g

We came here for our annual retreat and work plan. For that purpose, we need to have a room for discussion and this Tung Lok Seafood restaurant at Arena Country Club was kind enough to provide a room free of charge for our retreat and work plan discussion. Complimentary Chinese tea and prawn crackers were also served and indirectly helped to stimulate our brain work. After the work plan discussion, we proceeded to the table at the main hall for our sumptuous dinner. The staff were very courteous and the service was good. My Chairman had ordered the set dinner for us and I found the dishes were unconventional and creative. It was my first time tasting the coffee ribs. The meat was tender and when added the coffee, the flavor was superb. I also noticed my colleague who chose the vegetarian option having a bowl of millet fried with olive oil. It was healthy and uniquely creative. It was also my first time seeing such a special dish. The staff helped to slice up the fish and served the fish meat in a bowl for us. While the service is good, the fish soup was rather salty and deprived off the fish taste. It would be ideal to reduce the salt content. I particularly like the broccoli fried with scallops. The broccoli was freshly green and appetizing. The slight bitterness of pomelo fruit slices mixed with the sweet honey dew and sago gave me a refreshing taste of the unique dessert served. I could feel the creativity of the chef to concoct such a product. The bowl of fish maw soup was slippery smooth, appetizing and nutritious. It was another signature product.The design of each dish has great creativity in them. None was plain and simple. I could feel the refined culinary art display in the creation of such dishes. They differ from the conventional Chinese restaurant food I used to eat during wedding dinners. I would like to thank the chef for his painstaking effort put in to create such an extraordinary and unconventional culinary dishes. The ambience is also conducive for our team interaction. The manager arranged us at a corner of the large restaurant and we could talk to our heart without interference from the noise or the rowdiness of the other tables of patrons. We look forward to come again in our next retreat

My family and I had their a la carte buffet again on Christmas Eve as my parents preferred Chinese food. We took the earlier seating at 6pm and it was quite packed. There were 3 items that we were able to order once only and the staff quickly served them as they were signature dishes: chili crab, thai sauce green mussels and fish maw soup. They were all very good. The other perennial dishes were consistently good e.g. fish skin with salted yolk and fried soon hock fish with HK style soy sauce. Their dessert menu was limited but I like their herbal jelly. At 38++ I would say that it's great value for money compared to Ban Heng restaurant which was also on the same floor.
5
We had the chilli Dungeness crab (always excellent), eggplants, XO carrot cake, har kow, siew mai and lo mai kai. And for desserts, we had almond jelly and coconut with ice-cream topped with black rice - A* to the chef and team. Compliments to Jennifer- 6 stars service

Seafood theme menu. Kind of pricey. For 2 dishes and 1 dessert and 1 soup each for 2 pax, the bill was nearly $100.
5
My friend & I enjoyed the food served at Tung Lok Seafood at Orchard Central.
We had chilli crab, tofu with veggies & fried baby octopus.
4
Good service, overall the main dish is very good and the portion is just nice. Not too big, dim sum need improve.
5
We ordered the black pepper Dungeness crab, fried carrot cake and almond jelly with logans- 6 stars. Compliments to the Chef and team.
6 stars service from Fanny, Jennifer & Lian Fung.
5
We ordered the Dungeness crab in chilli sauce- 6 stars coz it’s chilli hot and hot sweet. Compliments to the Chef and team.
6 stars Service - Zhi Fang, Eu Ah Lian and Candy.
1
We went to this restaurant because the pictures of the food were very appetizing but the food was awful the steam prawns were like peel it shrimp with little or no flavor and the Yuan Yang rice was a bland unappetizing chicken rice soup. In addition they brought the dumpling appetizer in between the two courses. No way would ever go to this restaurant agai
5
We ordered the laksa Dungeness crab and egg plant. They are excellent. Compliments to the Chef and team, laksa was not too lemak (rich with coconut milk and salty) and it is chilli hot. Compliments to Fanny, Qiu Min, Wei Nan & Susan - 6 stars servic
3
Had higher expectation from TungLok's brand but the food served were pretty average in general. Shark's fine soup was very starchy, though green mussels which was only limited to 1 serving per table, we had a big portion untouched as its not that great, herbal prawn broth was over diluted but prawn was well cooked. The rest of the food were alright but not great and i guess for the amount they charge, we didn't have high expectation for the quality
4
Decided to come here with the family for lunch and try their a la carte buffet. The food overall with good quality although a few items were only okay. The best items was the salted egg yolk fish skin, so crispy, hot, delicious melt in your mouth and the flavor was good and strong. The dim sum was also not bad, the spring rolls and siew mai and har gow were good. The seafood hor fun was also excellent. Very good fragrance, texture and flavor with lots of delicious eggy sauce.The prawn paste chicken wings were not very flavorful and the salmon sashimi although very fresh was not cut very well. The dessert was also only okay but overall the experience was good, staff very friendly, quick and flexible and the food came out in good timing
2
Purchased vouchers off CHOPE and decided to celebrate my brother's birthday there as it was our first time dining at Tunglok Seafood. The meal didn't start off as the very best with our food served almost cold. Out of the 3 cold dish/10 main dish/5 desserts we ordered, only 2 main dishes was served hot and crispy. Everything else was lukewarm or otherwise, cold. Chili Crabs was served and we asked for the washing bowl 3 times with 3 different staffs but was ignored. Yet other tables who were only just seated was immediately served when they haven't even ordered. The prawns was unfortunately served bad- it smelt bad, the squid was served under-cooked and the crispy dumplings (guo tie) was served so cold, the skin tasted like rubber. Overall experience was terrible. We would rather stick to Lao Beijing in future
4
Used to patron this restaurant and decided to go again and it didn’t dissapoint overall. However, noticed that there’s been some reduction in the type of dishes offered for its dinner ala carte buffet. But in general ok for the price range.
3
Went to their branch in Jurong and had lunch with old customers. Basically this is simple local seafood and nothing special. Just quick Chinese lunch; totally forgetable and nothing to write home....
4
Great place to bring foreign guests for a sampling of Peking Duck, bamboo clams, pepper crabs, abalone and other dishes. All of my guests have loved it. For me, the to die for dish is the dessert of yam paste.....not many places have this dish.
5
It was my first visit to this tung lok restaurant. Tung lok in general is above average standard. The branch in orchard central is definitely highly recommended
3
Typically Tung Lok is located near downtown so was nice to find this at the western part of town. This seafood is located inside Arena Country Club. We had tim sum lunch buffet which the selection was quite good.
5
Was there with my family when my children treated their father to lunch. It was an ala Carte buffet. You can also additionally add on from their standard menu if you want, especially to try their crab dish. There are lots to choose from, easily, a hundred. You can see a sample of their ala carte list from my photos. Overall, most of the dishes are quite decent. I will go back again if I want a wide spread of food to ea
5
This place is amazing! Great view, great food! I did not care much for the fish soup as it was quite soapy, but the seafood made it all up! I hihgly recommend the signature shrimp, wokked with oystersauce and the sugnature pepper-crab! This was fingerlicking good! Prepare to get dirty though, because getting all that delicious crab takes some work! Excellent restaurant; quite pricy, but totally worth it! Having a Mandarin speaking person with you is advisable, as English did not run very easy. Def a 9/10 score

We have patronised this hidden gem at Orchard area, several times.It is one of the earliest Chinese seafood restaurant for a sumptious weekend brunch, which starts as early as 10am, until 3pm.It is a value at SGD28.80++ for an adult, for lunch on weekends and public holidays.We had second servings of their fresh salmon sashimi and jelly fish with pomelo sauce. The crispy fish skin with salted egg yolk was crunchy and highly addictive.The mini octopus, sliced beef and eggplant with pork floss were nice.The fish maw bisque was hearty and delicious.For mains, we enjoyed their deep fried Thai-style sliced fish. Their feep fried prawn with crispy oats were fresh.They had prawn in the chilli sauce usually cooked with crab.Green mussels with sambal BBQ sauce was enjoyable.Their coffee pork ribs were also decadent.We had seconds of their tender chicken with honey black pepper sauce.Steamed beancurd skin rolls and beancurd skin rolls with shrimps were moorish too.For dessert, we tried the light and cooling ice cream puffs (small bite-size) and refreshing chilled chrysanthemum jelly with osmanthus.The herbal jelly with honey was also a good ending to a satisfying meal.Service was very attentive and efficient, and they constantly changed our plates, and topped up Chinese tea at SGD2 per person.Highly recommended since Tung Lok Seafood has been serving consistently very good dishes, for years
4
The restaurant was pretty crowded on a Friday night, therefore there was some waiting time before our dishes were served. Their Ala Carte Dinner buffet was slightly better than expected. We were able to try quite a number of dishes as they allowed us to order smaller serving for our order (e.g. request for 4 pieces of XX instead of the usual 8 pieces)
5
I enjoy going to this restaurant.My grandson 1 yrs old birthday and my birthday i always go there.All my relatives and friends say the foods very fresh and delicious.Especially the white pepper crab very nice and cheap. Yesterday lunch i went there again i order wasabi prawn scallops w veg,sauteed frog w ginger and chili crab sooooo nice. Service from the managers and the rest of their team is friendly and polite. Weekend you must book if not you will disappointed
1
Had a very bad experience there.
Pricy yet badly prepared food was served.
Food is not even comparable.
Don't go there if you can.
4
Location is central and overlooking the busy orchard road. Food is good n plentiful. A lot of varieties and fresh. Its value for money.

We dropped by this branch of Tung Lok whenever we're in Singapore. It hasn't really disappointed us in any way. Although there were occasionally inconsistency with quality or taste, the restaurant always replaced or refunded the questioned dish for us. There's always that one or two confused servers but service from the managers and the rest of their team is friendly, helpful and polite.We're not big fans of the buffet menu despite its popularity with locals. We usually phone ahead to order specific dishes or occasionally drop in without reservations just to spice things up a bit. It also helps to make sure the head chef is working the kitchen on the day.On this visit, we had the manager's recommendation of seafood vermicelli. The prawns and clams were fresh and swimming in a light yet sweet seafood broth. We also enjoyed the light hit of spice from the dried chilies tossed with live frogs, the sweet and crunchy fried baby squids and the green baby kai lan vegetable. The seafood mee goreng was also nicely wok-charred with chili paste.We're looking forward to our next meal of 2 kilograms Sri Lankan crab
3
The standard deteriorated badly.Our meal (a-la-cart) cost about $500- for 5 paxs but the food was really not worth.The roast chicken was too dry.The fish needed to be sent in for 2nd steamThe crab was watery.Their service.... @x@They kept recommending higher value seafood but I think the fresh food just went to waste.It's still pretty crowded. I think their buffet was still drawing the crowd
4
We had our team CNY lunch here. It was a set menu with yusheng, peking duck, fish, chicken soup. It is atmospheric and they were also kind enough to cater to our vegetarian colleague who had his own yusheng to toss. (kind of misses the point but anyway). highly recommended but it is pricey. staff were not too keen to fry the left over duck pieces - its lazy in my opinion
3
visited for the ala lunch buffet during weekdays.relatively crowded but not full house. staff strength seems okay. but server was very inattentive. probably due to the position of our table, he always has his back to us. when we finally gotten his attention, he told us to wait and then forgot to come back. a lady served us desserts and one of them was not what we ordered. she kind of insisted we take it but we did not want so she gave a face.food was not impressive. the sashimi is the draw but it's not very fresh. there are hits and misses for other items. we enjoyed the salted egg fried fish skin the most. some dishes came cold. the price is reasonable but we do have some expectations because of the tunglok brand name
5
Went there to celebrate my dad's 70th birthday. We booked 2 tables for ala cart buffet for 15 pax. From the time i called yo book till the time we left, only one word i can describe our feeling: WOW!!!!!.The food was delicious. But most importantly, the service was great. Especially Felicia. She was just wonderful in her service All my family members were impressed by her and her ability to bring laughter to all of us.Will definitely recommend others to this place
4
My friend highly recommended this restaurant and we tried it for the first time at Christmas Eve. We enjoyed the beer prawns and oat prawns as they were fresh and full of flavour! The yuzu dressing jellyfish with cucumber salad was refreshing and easy on the palette. I liked the 3 limited-serving dishes the most: fish maw soup (with rich broth), Thai green mussels with special chilli sauce, and chilli crab. The waitress and manager who served our table were attentive, friendly and helpful. For $38.80 ++ per pax, the a la carte buffet dinner was overall reasonably good in terms of quality and value for money.
1
Ordered the set dinner on 15th Dec.Food was horrible with no quality.Not worthy of even a single cent spend there. Asked the cashier if this was Tung Lok's standard as I was paying for quality food.Cashier arrogantly said 'yes this is it'.DO NOT GO THERE
4
Had our lunch here, the food and service was tip top. It helped that we had a chinese friend with us who did the ordering, a selection of rice, vegtable and seafood. All beautifully cooked, very tasty and enjoyable meal will certainly go back on our return to Singapore.the only negative was trying to locate it within the orchard central shopping. (It is on the tenth floor
4
We probably have been in this restaurant a dozen times and we keep coming back because of the staff which have slowly became our friends. Nice ambience, good food, awesome value with the Amex plat card. What more can you ask for?
4
The ala-carte buffet was decent, range was good. They covered items like salmon sashimi to dim sum items! Only draw back was that they did missed out on some of the items ordered. They should have a proper ordering system in place to take the orders
5
We had a family lunch, four generations together! We received friendly and attentive service. The variety of dishes ordered were freshly prepared and most palatable. This was a lunch a la carte buffet. We would recommend booking as the restaurant does tend to get quite full. Overall a happy family occasion
4
Slightly awkward at first but the lady who served us had a slight difficulty understanding what we wanted (we are kiwis ). She got a younger staff member to take our order but she came back and ended up serving up the main into the bowls. Lovely food so so so fresh,
5
I brought my friends from USA and they were very impressed with the food and enjoyed the dinner. We ordered the curry prawns, rice in superior soup, vermicelli, pork ribs , almost every dish in the menu ! The dessert was fantastic ! The coconut jelly , the avocado ice cream Everything was yummy There were also a sweet surprise that was served in a test-tube .. , which was like a fruit juice with beetroot , totally refreshing and detoxing after all the food ..A great place to host lunch , dinner , special occasion
3
Went to the Tung Lok at Orchard Central. We didn't make a reservation but the restaurant had plenty of spare tables, but you wouldn't think that the way the Maitre'd greeted us. Overall the food flavours were good but its badly let down by the staff and service. The food delivery was ad hoc, with our last starter being delivered just as we were finishing (2hours after being ordered), no water supplied to the table, took 3 attempts to order a bottle of wine they actually had and we felt that as were were the only non Chinese that we were more of a problem that guest. I would not return
3
one of the chain restaurant in Singapore .. well the food is OK and with a few choices .. if you are keen in Chinese/cantonese for lunch and dinner , a good place to be, but the dim sum is good too. you may try order some side dish ..
5
I was on a look out for a non-touristy restaurant that serves good crabs, somewhere away from the touristy area like Boat Quay or Clark Quay. I found this. No regrets. Most of the people who dined there were really families out on bonding over good lunch or dinner. My family and I ordered crabs, prawns and fish head curry. The latter was not on the menu but the chef was kind enough to whip up something out of the fish head available but not curry. It went ok although of course it would have been better if it were a fish head curry. The restaurant is neither cheap nor expensive. It's somewhere in between. I like it there because food is good, the place is not crowded, along Orchard, and just a leisurely walk from the Somerset residences
4
Tung lok seafood @ Upper Jurong rd. Quiet place and away from the madding crowd. Nice neon lighting. Due to the after rain, it makes dinner so welcoming. Quickly order some house speciality and the food arrived relatively fast. Great taste and still steaming hot. Service is good. Staffs is friendly and accomodating. Highly recommended to eat in here
4
My last day in Singapore and I hadn't had Chilli Crab. As I was shopping on Orchard Road my friend suggested Tung Lok Seafood. Food was great, the chilli crab was beautiful and the little bread rolls were amazing, our server was very nice and helpful too. We did ask for it mild as I don't like things too spicy and although they said it was mild it was still pretty spicy. The food was a little expensive, but as I didn't have the opportunity to search around for a little hole in the wall I still enjoyed my Singaporean experience with Chilli Crab
1
The staff here are not friendly. The food is average at best and overpriced. We regretted the decision to find this place and visit it. There are many better option in orchard road. Stay away from this place.
4
Services was good but need repeated reminders.
Buffet price not so worth it as Chilli crab and shark fin soup only one time serving. A meal for 8 is about 440 plus dollar.
Overall , foods was great.
4
For $38 the all you can eat buffet option is amazing. It's not a 'buffet' just a menu you order from as much as you want, including one crab per table, and is such good value. Beware the nuts / edamame which are automatically put on the table and charged for. They only two transactions allowed for payment so we split the bill in half, to be paid by two cards. for some reason my card was then charged twice, my friend's was not charged. this caused a lot of confusion the next day when i went back to try and get one half refunded! hopefully this is a one off, as the food is great and i would otherwise return
4
I really love the presentation of each dish example the noodle with broth was serve in a bamboo. I like the most which was the shark fins soup serve in a pumpkin. The pumpkin has the natural sweetness. The fish fillet was not really fresh. Other than that, overall was good
4
Tried this restaurant yesterday. Good place to dine with friends and family. Must try London duck and some famous Chinese seafood. First time trying this restaurant. Service quite good. If you have AMEX. They do have a palate program with TungLok restaurant. Very good discount and good ambience. Will be here again.
4
Going alone to the restaurant is not very much Asian style. So most of this restaurant menu is designed to 4-8 people as a set of many small dishes.If you alone like me on business trip it is better to go to selection of starters.I had very good lobster in homey and spacy duck tongues - goes well with bee
4
It is a fine dining restaurant, popular with the locals and international Asian travellers. You must book in advance or you will miss out on a table. We had their famous sharks fin soup but didn't try the chilli crab which they are also famous for
5
Went to dinner here. Salmon sashimi is really good. Chili crab is citrus flavored but also good especially with the mantou. Cereal prawn is also good. Wasnt able to order everything but the quality of food is great. Two thumbs up will come back again to try the other dishes
5
Chilli Crab is to die for. Great to share the plate as one would be too much for one person to eat. Staff are really attentive and patient. Our waitress went above an beyond helping us to eat the crab and shell it properly. I recommend the Chilli Crab, BBQ Pork and Bean Curd wit Mushrooms and Greens. Definitely a must to eat at.Head to level 11 at Orchard Central.Amazing

This review is specifically for the Orchard Central outlet for ala carte buffet on a weekday. Worked out to be about $35 per person inclusive of tea/pickles and taxes. I had fond memories of Tung Lok ala carte buffet from yesteryears and was thus disappointed with the much reduced spread. Only 2 types of soup (used to have pigeon soup and sharksfins, corn soup, etc). The seafood soup came first and it looked like from a microwave and not boiling hot from a pot. It was too thick (almost like a pudding). Fish skin was nice and dim sum ok. Some servings come in large portions while others were very small so not very consistent (for eg. the california maki came in large while the chicken only has a few pieces). Sashimi is ok but none of the other dishes were very good, just average. The worst was dessert - the ice cream puff used to be soft skin with nice ice cream in there. Now it is completely frozen and the ice cream taste like ice. The Chilled Chrysanthemum Jelly was hard as a rock and you cannot break it with your spoon unless you apply real force. About the venue itself, it is on the 11th floor with nice views. However it is not easy to get to especially if you catch the wrong elevator - there are no direction signs to tell that you need to change elevator on the 9th floor. If they don't do something about it, they will be overtaken by the paradise group that has better food, better prices and much better service
4
Order the appetiser 'Fried fish skin with salted egg', definitely the best and I don't normally eat fish skin. The other dishes are good.
On weekends call to book or there won't be any space.
4
Had a la carte dinner at Orchard Central branch, food is great and reasonable price. Black pepper crabs was delicious. Advance reservations recommended especially for dinner.
3
Don't really have anything bad to say, everything is good but nothing memorable. Personally, the food is a little heavy tasting to me. To others it's actually ok. But service was good. Toilet really need some work. As it's only 1 stall, the ladies need to line up all the way to outside blocking the entrance to men's restroom
4
Had lunch over the holiday with my family.There is Ala Cart buffet for Dim Sum. Good spread for those who like DimWe ordered Ala Cart menu dishes we like.Steam fish, drunken prawns - seafood fresh and well prepared.Spring Chicken, coffee pork ribs and spinach with eggs. Coffee ribs a must try - meat very tender. Make reservation if you have a big group.Worth visiting again
4
I had a group dinner at this restaurant on 11th floor of Orchard Central and was pleasantly surprised that an ala carte buffet of the scale and quality could be had for only $46 nett. We ordered a wide range of foods: Sea bass, mussels, cereal prawns, salmon sashimi, crispy fried salmon skin, and of course the fried rice. The service was prompt, but you had to be able to speak a little Chinese to communicate with the servers, who are China workers. Overall, great value for someone with a large appetite
4
I have tried other ala carte Chinese buffet like peach garden one before but tung lok food is definitely tastier and fresher. You should go earlier as it takes time to prepare the food. The food is fresh and tastes delicious. There are a wide variety of choices of cooked food and dessert. However if you do not eat spicy food then you can't taste the chili crab as they cannot change the way they cook. Every seasoning is fixed as described by the menu.The staff are also friendly and efficient. Ambience is nice. Worth the money . will recommend .
5
Nice welcome from the lady in spite of not having a reservation, we got immediately a table for two.The menu is tempting so we took a few dumplings, steamed and fried to start with. Very good!Then a chilli crab that was verry good too, in a generous portion, and finally a pepper crab: this was excellentissimo!Savoury meat, good dose of strong pepper and a lot of onions.Divine indeed!A good beer to cleanse your buds then after and you are up for a good afternoon, happy and well fed!A highly recommended place
4
During a stay in Singapore where we had lived for many years previously, we met up with close friends whom 'surprised' my wife and I with an evening meal in Orchard Central at the Tung Lok..The service was friendly the food fantastic especially the chille crab ..supurb..We will again dine at the Tung Lok when we are next in Singapore
3
Visited the outlet today for a celebratory meal with my colleagues. We had the Ala Carte Buffet. Unlike the traditional buffet, we simply looked at the menu and listed the quantity of a particular dish that we wanted. The spread was alright - with a mix of dim sum, Chinese zhi-char styled dishes, starters etc. The star of the show were certainly the salmon sashimi and fried salted egg yolk salmon skin. The salmon sashimi serving was pretty generous in quantity and the fish slices were reasonably thick. They were also pretty fresh. Our table of 10 had 6 plates of salmon sashimi so that should given you an idea. While the salmon was good, I really loved the fried salted egg yolk salmon skin. It was tasty and fried to perfection. Everyone one of us had good things to say about the dish. We ordered - har gao, siew mai, carrot cake. The siew mai was pretty decent but otherwise the dim sum was generally alright with nothing to rave about. However, a dish that you would probably like to avoid would be the century egg porridge - it was bland and a total waste of your calories. Same goes for the seafood soup, it was starchy and not all that tasty. Overall, the meal cost about $30 per pax and it's good for value if you have extra servings of the salmon sashimi and fried salmon skin. However, do ask about the serving portions so that you'll be able to gauge if the quantity ordered is sufficient. The staff are helpful and efficient so don't be shy
4
We love the chilli crab here and take most of our visitors to sample it - the rest of the items on the menu are equally as good, and they have a reasonable Riesling on the menu as well.No need to go miles for it, and the service is lovely and smiling too :
4
The food and service at this location were very good. The food selection was great. Look for a table that is not close to an AC vent, so the cold air does not blow on you.
4
We had a wonderful chilli crab here, amongst other dishes. Clientele was all local Chinese, it was very busy, and we needed to make a reservation. Total cost for 3 was S$225 including S$70 bottle of wine & 10% service charge. Location is opposite Emerald Hill, which is 10 minutes walk from the busy tourist shopping end of Orchard Rd
4
Location is perfect: just above Somerset MRT, it is located on the 11th floor of Orchard Central and as such, commands a great view. Being on the top floor it is away from the noise of Orchard Road. There is even a rooftop garden to explore before or after eating at the restaurant.Service was impeccable. The waitresses were very efficient and helpful. Plates were being changed frequently. Food was served very quickly too. They didn't try to make you order the most expensive dishes and gently reminded you if you ordered too many dishes. I was definitely impressed by the good service.Food was good too. We ordered prawns, black pepper crab, fish fillets, kai lan vegetable, soup and abalone. All the dishes were satisfactory. The dessert menu was very comprehensive and we all enjoyed our desserts.I would definitely recommend this restaurant
5
The restaurant is a little hard to find located on the 11th floor of the Orchard Central shopping centre but, it is well worth the effort.Luckilly we made our reservation at this restaurant 3 weeks ahead as it was totally full. This is the place to come if you are in search of crab which is prepared in your joyce of sauces incluidng the ever popular chilli. My advise is don't wear your best white shirt here, even though the restaurant provides a nice bib to protect you, the sauce manages to get everywhere.The crab dish costs $6 per kilo and expect the crab to weigh around 1 kilo. This was a very reasonable price compared to the prices we saw at Clark Quay.Just in case your not in search of the best ever chilli crab there is a great choice of other seafood dishes to pick from such as the drunken prawns and various whole fish dishes.There is also a great selection of wines and beers to select from. We go for any deserts so we can't comment on them.Definitely recommend this great sea food restaurant and we will return on our next visit to Singapor
5
The restaurant is on the 11th floor in Orchard Central, downtown. We had a course dinner, which included fish, chili crab, black pepper crab, mango soup, and steamed rice with lotus leaves. Every food was really good. We also had a beatuiful night view of downtown Singapore. Sommerset Mrt station is under the same building
4
My business partner and I were wandering down Orchard St and decided to find a place to eat chili crab. Luckily for us there was a highly rated restaurant just a few blocks away. It's on the 11th floor of Orchard Central- a very nice shopping center. It was a nice quiet (but full) restaurant with fantastic service. Everyone that served us spoke some English and were eager to make suggestions. We told the server to select a veggie side dish and we ordered the chili crab to share. The veggie turned out to be a local plant- similar to the US "greens" cooked with garlic and was delicious. The chili crab was an interesting flavor- very citrusy, sweet and lightly spicy. Not to my taste (or my Japanese friend) at all. But I can see where people might really like it. My son and husband would have loved it. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone.The prices seemed reasonable, the service fantastic and the food was good

Once we found Tung Lok in Orchard Central opposite the Concorde Hotel we can highly recommend it for a comprehensive menu and great value for money.When they say Chilli crab they mean it .Be prepared for a yummy dish and make sure you have cold water next to you.We arrived late from Australia and didn't fancy the street food near our hotel but for super fresh mudcrab at AUD$50.00 for two to share you cant go wrong.Other dishes were terrific as well and drinks prices are reasonable.Great service and very busy---Can highly recommend

We ate here based on the reputation and were not let down. Admittedly this is our first chilli crab experience but I cant imagine it could taste much better. We also ate the razor clams which were excellent as well. Thank goodness for the bibs as we made a huge mess as we stuffed ourselves silly! An outstanding experience!

We wondered through Orchard Road centre and went to the roof top garden for a look. We stumbled into Tung Lok as we wanted something light like dumplings. Bit of a language barrier but we did OK. We had pork dumplings, the pork prawn and mushroom dumplings (were very good). We then tried the beef with ginger and shallot (husbands fave) and pork with sesame. We ordered steam rice but they called it fried rice. It cost $71, so cheap for how good it was!

Had the ala-carte dinner buffet with friends and I would say some of the dishes are mediocre. Have also tried the other outlet at Arena Country Club and the dishes available here are quite different from Orchard Central's outlet; they do not have chili crab though and have different dessert choices

We went there for early Mother's Day lunch with my mum and siblings and their families. The food and services were better than expected. Nice place and convenient location too. Highly recommended!

The service was great and they catered for an unexpected large group.
The food was reasonable but I was a little disappointed with the chilli crab which is one of my favourite Singapore dishes.

11th floor of a typical Orchard Street monstrous building, this restaurant does not get stars for location. However, it has a strong following, evidenced by how busy and slick it is.The specialty is seafood, with many takes on crab, oysters, fish etc. These were all good, but not memorably so. But we had really good crispy chicken.Service was very quick for our group of 10. Price seemed way too high, as compared to other comparable quality eateries.On short notice, across the street from our hotel, this worked, but was not good enough to warrant considering this a top choice. Singapore just has too many better restaurants

We had lunch at Tung Lok Orchard central a few months ago. We ordered a few dishes and were happy all the dishes. We tried fresh oysters and these were bigger than expected and were fresh too. Chilly crab was not to our liking for 100% but can't find fault with it. Other dishes were delicious too. The staffs were helpful and efficient. 5 of us had a decent lunch with just Chinese tea and we were not big eaters and the bill was almost $200. Since we went in with a discount voucher, we saved some $. We will go there again for good Chinese food in the future

At orchard central level 11. We had the ala carte buffet lunch. Great variety and is tasty. Must make reservation as there are times they are fully booked. The service is fast and efficient. Great place to get together.Our must have crispy fish skin, black pepper beef and eggplant with floss

Tung Lok Seafood is at level 11 at Orchard Central. The main set of escalators takes you to level 7, then just beside the glass wall of the building, facing Orchard Road is an escalator that takes you straight from level 7 to level 11.The restaurant apparently has won a few awards for it's food. It's not the best but is very good.I tried some Prawns with dried chillies, Braised sliced Abalone with spinach, and some Pork ribs. All the dishes were very nice. If I had more room in my tummy I'd have tried the Sea Whelk poached in superior broth.The first half of the menu has fresh seafood cooked in different ways, priced by weight. The later half has dishes priced per portion. They also have set menu options for lunch

I received an sms that read like this: Celebrate yr bday at a TungLok restaurant. Show sms & enjoy 20% rebate dine-in la carte & set menu this DEC. I reserved a table for 7 people. on 12/12/13. I showed my sms to the receptionist and afte the dinner I asked for the bill and the amount was nearly $300.00. When I mentioned about the discount, the lady said no discount but only points. I felt cheated.

If you like crab this is the place to go. We went for the chilli crab but also ordered the black pepper crab which we enjoyed even more. There were two of us and two crabs and this was more than enough food, but we didn't know how generous they would be so we ordered an entree of scallops, which were also delicious. For seafood lovers, this restaurant is a paradise.The staff were also very gracious about the mess we made and provided ample napkins and damp towels to assist us in keeping ourselves clean

Wanted to go this restaurant which I found on Trip Advisor to try the chilli crab which we had had 26 years before in Singapore.Wasn't easy to find this restaurant on Orchard rd. It is in the Orchard Central shopping centre on the 11th floor but there are no numbers on the street. We then got lost within the building as there are many escalators and lifts. It was very busy with locals when we arrived without a booking but there was a table for two available. In the end decided to try the black pepper crab. It was lovely but expensive. We had one crab between two ($50SGD) which is imported from Sri Lanka. They other food ordered was very good. Would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for any of the crab dishes

For those who stay around the Jurong area and if you are yearning for a quick fix to your Dim Sum cravings, there is not much choice.Tung Lok Arena in my opinion, does serve food at a reasonable standard and price in a clean and bright restaurant. What is attractive is their buffet (pocket friendly) and location (quite far out, and chances are you are likely to get a table here on weekends). On weekdays, they do cater to a lunch crowd working around the area. We started our day at Tung Lok Arena (511 Upper Jurong Road, The Arena Country Club) this morning (17 Aug 2013, Saturday).Everything went on well after we sitted and placed our order. We added BBQ Pork Pastry shortly after with one of the Captain, Alice. Half way through our lunch, our little one passed motion. We allowed him some time to clear everything, before we change his diapers. I reminded our order (it could not have taken so long, as it is a ready dish) with another plump lady who returned and told us that Alice did not load in our order. We sought her help to expedite and continued finishing up our lunch.Time passed and we decided to ask for the bill (it happened to be Alice again) while waiting for the item to be served. Neither came back after some time as the wait has been unreasonably long,Finally, my wifey went to change his diapers and I walked personally to Alice to settle both issues. She told me that she did not load in the order (BBQ Pork Pastry) as the item is not yet served. I replied her that everything has been going on so slow (I need to remind the waitress again) that we decided to pay before the dish is being served. What's more, she could have asked, if in doubt!So to leave this place, I told her to cancel the dish and I could make the payment and leave. Guess what, I still see the item reflected in the bill!Among all my visits, whether are they for family meals or business lunches/dinners, their services have been acceptable. However, my experience today is different

A great Seafood restaurant with an authentic Singaporean cuisine. Great ambience and excellent service. Overwhelmed with the service provided by their staff.

With long waiting time for my orders and poor food quality, I am pleasantly surprised with the rather high ratings of this restaurant. The chili crab serving (1 per table) was extremely pathetic; it was two tiny crabs and there was hardly any meat in them. I honestly cannot remember everything I ordered but some dishes include: salmon sashimi; fried meat rolls; fried whole fish in oyster sauce and fish maw soup. All of which (including the dishes which I cannot remember) were at best, mediocre.However, credit should be given to the service of the staff. They were very attentive and constantly changed our plates and refilled our glasses without us having to ask them to do so. But overall, I was really disappointed with the quality of the food. Perhaps, this was a one off incident i.e. wrong night to patronize this restaurant given that it was pretty crowded, but it has left a bad impression which will prevent me from returning anytime soon

Went for Mother's Day ala carte buffet dinner at the Jurong outlet and were quite disappointed with the services n food servedWe ordered the items n half of which never came n were being missedWe had to remind the staff and chased after them for the food to be servedThe chilli crabs supposed to be one of the attrractions was taken off the menu !Some food were way below standardService a bit slow but understandable due to Mother's day celebrationWill not go back again as out of the way to in Upper Jurong near Saft

I was planning to go to the Seafood Centre for dinner, but was tired from spending the day at the zoo and didn't want to take the kids and have to deal with the inconsistant services provided by the restaurants there.So I decided to go to Tung Lok Seafood at Orchard Centre which was within walking distance. The service was superb.The staff were efficient and the lady who seemed to be in charge was happy to make some of the dishes kids friendly. You might be able to have great food but poor service can easily spoil your experience, and there is no worries here.The food may not be exceptional but good and I had the most relaxing and pleasant time

I'm not usually a fan of Tung Lok, and in terms of chinese food chains, would rate it a distant 3rd behind Imperial Treasure and Crystal Jade. My colleagues suggested to go to this place for lunch and i was surprised to see an a la carte buffet deal for SGD25. I was skeptical so started with low expectations and an open mind. Ordered the standard dim items - pork pastry, pork buns, chicken feet, they were all surprisingly good. They even had fried fish with salted egg yolk which was unusual and tasted good. Fried rice was ok, a little too oily. The congee was too tiny a bowl to share. Desserts were not as fascinating as the earlier dim sum. Overall a good experienced and i was pleasantly surprised, probably due to my low expectations. Would i return when convenient? I suppose so. Are they now better than Imperial and Crystal? Probably no

We visited Orchard Central’s branch of Tung Lok Seafood, which is located high above on the 11th floor. It was crowded and buzzy when we arrived, but nobody looked frazzled and I have to say the service here was the best. The Auntie provided sage guidance on the menu and we tried Steamed Marble Goby, Honey Chicken, Wasabi Prawns, Garlic Beef, Baby Kai Lan and Spicy Noodles.All was excellent – but special credit definitely goes out to the Wasabi Prawns (picture above) which were deep-fried perfectly and covered in a light wasabi mayonnaise which had a bit of a kick. The Garlic beef was also cooked so that the insides were still slightly pink with shards of fried crispy garlic on the top.They are popular for their Pepper Beef and Singapore Chilli Crab, but they also serve sashimi, oysters and seafood platters.Definitely make a booking! Well worth a try

I frequently take my business associates the branch at the Jurong Arena Country Club. The decoration of the restaurant was so-so, looked kind of old and not well kept. The food was good though. However, I would advise you to order the a la carrte, rather than the buffet. The buffet looked like it was cooked in mass production (jointly with other table’s orders). In terms of freshness, not all fish is fresh every day, so best to ask the waiter/waitress on what is the catch of the day. A recommended dish would be their chilli crab. Also, It would be nice to have someone who speaks Chinese with you, as not all attendants can speak English

Went with our Singaporean colleagues for a Chinese New Year lunch at the Arena Country Club outlet. A very busy place and well patronized by the locals which says a lot and we told they had a very big reputation. Seafood is the specialty and while traditional chili crab etc is on the menu our hosts gave us among many banquet dishes, Braised Abalone, Shark Fin Soup, fresh steamed fish, and the signature dish Deep Fried Prawns with Wasabi Mayonaise, coffee braised pork ribs and yam and coconut dessert. Well worth the effort for genuine Singapore style seafood

Colleague from the USA wanted Black Pepper Crab and I wanted something in Orchard Road area. Tung Lok Seafood came up on my TripAdvisor search, and what a great recommendation it was.Location: Tung Lok Seafood is on the 11th floor of the relatively new Orchard Central on Orchard Road at the corner of Killiney Road and its next door to Somerset MRT so dead easy to get to. Orchard Central is a funky mall not at all like any of the other cloned malls in Singapore so it's already a favourite location of ours, lots and lots and lots of food options too.View: Being on the 11th floor gives great views across the top of the buldings toward SunTec from one direction and down to River Valley from the other, so get a window seat and enjoy the sky or the lights depending on the time of day or night. No view, no worries, the decor is really interesting and pleasant. Lots of bamboo and river stones, glass and panelling to make it private and open at the same time.Ambience: see above, it is a very pleasant place, not too noisy like a lot of seafood restaurants in Singapore. My colleague and I were able to discuss work without worrying about being overheard by those on the next tables and also we didnt have to shout to be heard. Lighting is good.Food: Wow. I had heard good things about Tung Lok but I am ashamed that in nearly a decade of being in Singapore this was my first time eating here. It will not be my last for sure. We had Black Pepper Crab as the main attraction. Staff correctly recommended the right size for two hungry men, none was left and we had just enough too. No attempt to oversell at all, Top marks. Also the wasabi prawns with mayonnaisse was superb followed by the double boiled chicken soup with mushroom (chicken foot alert!) and the chinese spinach with 3 egg to finish off. Really the food was just superb, servings were perfect size, served hot, served fresh and the taste of each dish was recommended to compliment the others without being drowned in too much chili or other spices. 10/10 for the food.Service: This was the greatest surprise. Now singapore is not well known for good service and the F&B industry in particular gets and in most cases deserves the bad reputation that it gets. Tung Lok Seafood smashes this barrier in a spectacular way. I can way without reservation that the service here was the best I have ever experienced in Singapore. Nothing was a bother for the staff. They recognised that we two caucasians probably would not know exactly how to eat each dish, and they were right, and so they very discreetly stepped in to assist us choose the right implements and plates to use with each dish, it was so well done that we were not aware really that it was happening. Then when the crab arrives the paper bibs were whipped around our necks with a smile before we could spill the black pepper sauce down our clean shirts. I dont know who trained the staff, but they are the best in Singapore, probably equal to the best anywhere really. Price: All things considered the price for two for dinner (no drinks) was very reasonable. Not somewhere that you would eat every night, but for a business or special dinner with family and friend sthe price was quite good. I have paid for much less in other places in Singapore thats for sure, so I would never let this put me off.Overall this was one of the best dining experiences in Signapore for authentic Singapore/Chinese/Seafood cuisine. I will definitely return for lunch and or dinner with family, friends and business associates

Took my parents here for my dad's birthday celebration. Well, I have to say we were quite impressed with the quality of the food and the way they present it (fusion). food was great and fresh, especially important for seafood. only thing is the price, which is slightly on the high side
