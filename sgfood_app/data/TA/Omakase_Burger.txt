The best US burger chains that is - Shake Shake, 5 Guys, Smashburger. Charred on the outside. Medium rare on the inside. Scrumptious meat where "juicy" is a gross understatement. But delicious doesn't come cheap - SGD 16.90 for the basic cheeseburger.

I live inn Singapore and Im a frequent client.
The burger is very juicy (medium) ant the bread is fantastic!

After reading years of glowing reviews, had to give this burger a try, what more, it’s Orchard Rd/ Wisma Atria branch, apparently the only outlet to serve Apple Wood Bacon in its burgers. Unfortunately a signage on at the order counter stated a change of Bacon vendor and so I decided to go with it’s promotional Port wine & Blue Cheese burger instead. I thought the so called juicy US beef patty was borderline dry. This particular burger’s bottom bun was completely soaked through when I got to it, mostly from the caramelised onion and melted blue cheese - great combo, but the former a tad too sweet and portion of the latter was left wanting. For S$19.90 (which is likewise the price of its famous Apple Wood Bacon burger), I doubt there’ll be a second purchase any time soon. Potato Head Folk burgers are still the best in Singapore!

$18 Omakase burger was smallish in size and i asked for it to be cooked medium rare. Meat was done right but it was tasteless and completely lacked flavour. V tempted to bring it back but decided against it. Quite a shame considering so much hype about it.

We like very much their burger with beacon. The burger is always juicy and goes well with the pickles. The size of the burger seems to have shrunk in our recent visit. We ordered a set meal that come with fries and drink. The portion for fries was quite generous. The shop has recently relocated to 3rd floor in a common dining area called Picnic.

Claims to be the best burger in Singapore! Ordered the Apple wooded bacon cheese burger with fries and drinks. Waited and it came after a couple of minutes. Looks good and take that quick bite! I said to myself I have tasted better ones. As we check out we had to pay to a machine. It came $29.40. A whopper at Burger King is tastier and more worthwhile
5
At first i thought that Omakase Burger was close but actually they just moved to higher floor, some kind of foodcourt. I bought Applewood Smoked Bacon Cheese burger with cheese fries as a side dish. First of all i would like to review the size of the burger which is quiet big and for me, it is worth the price. Then for the taste, i also recommend this one (the one that i ordered) because especially for the meat-lovers, it was very satisfying to enjoy your lunch or dinner with a juicy and tender beef patty accompanied with melted cheese fries. Thats just perfect! Overall experience was good and definitely be back here when visit singapore again in the future!

Worst burger ive ever eaten in my life. Im not saying this to exaggerate, it is literally the worst burger ive ever eaten whether it be in terms of taste, portion size or value for money. For $25 I got a burger the size of a mcdonalds mcdouble (not joking, its the same size) that was absolutely tasteless, a rootbeer float with ice cream that was more ice than cream (the icecream actually diluted the rootbeer) and some fries (also comparable to mcdonalds). Anyways forgive the comparison to mcdonalds as I actually do eat and enjoy mcdonalds when I visit, cant say the same for omakase. So to be 100% frank, but if youre looking for the worst burger in singapore, omakase burger should be on your list of places to visit
4
Came here again during our visit and at first couldn't find it as at its former location was just a big construction blind and Omakase has now moved to to the third level and into the picnic food court in the back of the taxi stand. Not much has changed other than that you're now enjoying your burgers in an artificial garden setting. I'm not sure if they're still 100% tree same but they're still pretty good burgers with the meat as the main act not overpowered by any of the ingredients. They also still have that Mexican coke that I like so much
3
Over priced burger joint. The commonly coveted penchant for eating western food is so you can sink your teeth into crispy crunchy fries. Unfortunately, the fries here are plain sloppy. Great disappointment. Fresh beef patties but seriously overpriced burger. Unless you badly need a place to rest at Wisma Atria and want some Burger as fast food, then come here.
4
whenever I go to singapore I always eat omakase burger. it is expensive but it have the best taste. don't for get to try the truffle fries.
2
Paid $23 for a tiny burger about the same size as a McDonald's cheeseburger and small bowl of soggy fries.
The burger was fresh and quite tasty though just poor value for money.
Wouldn't go back.
4
I ordered cheese burger, chicken sandwich, ice lemon tea, ice peach tea, cheese fries, onion rings. Total $48++, good taste, big portion.
4
I had the bacon cheeseburger combo with fries and a root beer float. The burger was extremely juicy and good. The fries were only mediocre though which was a bit disappointing. A small thing but the root beer float contained ice, which made it tough for the ice cream to melt down into the root beer. As a result you don't get the crystallisation and the extra foam that a root beer float should have (and it is the ice cream that keeps the root beer cool of course. Not bad place to visit if you are there, and the burger is good, but I hope it is not really the best in all of Singapore
3
Omakase have a juicy burger but honestly its quite pricey for a burger. I know the concept its a gourmet burger,but in that price i honestly expect a gourmet burger serve in a plate or something like in a fancy restaurant,not in the burger joint like that.But the cheese fries is good,i like the melted cheese. But i think its overpriced for a burger,especially when youre in the tight budget
4
Pros:- patty taste nice, burger fans would love it! Its taste juicy.- tomato sauce, chili sauce, pickle free to refill at the counter- there's power outlet under the chair to recharge your mobile or laptopCons:- very expensive it'll cost around 20sgd for a burger! No drink or fries included. I paid another 3sgd for a can of coke. - small burger size- nothing fancy with the decoration. Its pretty straight forward clean look modern burger shop. With no lighting ambient and located nearby fashion shop.- only one cashier open this evening. Its gonna be a long queue when there's a lot of visito
4
If you are looking for a tender juicy burger with great fries, this is the place to be. We had the Omakase Applewood Smoked Bacon Cheeseburger... it was a pleasure to devour. Along with the burger we ordered the multiple kinds of fries as well as onion rings. We decided to go all out and just share all the good food amongst the group. It was a fully satisfying meal. Just make sure you come ready to get your hands dirty because the burger is definitely more satisfying when you eat it sloppily
4
It's good that no queuing for this place. Ordered Omakase cheese burger, sweet potato fries, truffle fries and drinks. The beef in the burger is juicy but for me it's a bit bland. Sweet potato fries is really nice, sweet and soft (not very crispy ones). Truffle fries is ok but does not have very strong truffle flavor.Will come back for the sweet potato fries
5
If you want a juicy flavorful diner style burger this is it.I think the restaurant achieved its goal of serving American style burgers. Where many Singaporean restaurants have an Asian flare to their burgers this place sticks to the classics.Fries are well made and toppings great.I think anyone who tries this place will be happy with what they get. Only downside is it's a bit pricey and one burger may not be filling
4
We ordered a classic burger which was really juicy and dripped with flavour. It wasnt very large though, but i guess it has to stay classy?The cheese fries were so-so, though the portion was huge.The burger was good I must admit, but it is overall rather pricey
5
Now I know being from California this is a sin to say, but the burger is the best burger I've had in Asia so I must rank it to the best burger in the world.... Definitely not as good as in&out, really pricey, but you have to pay for water in the desert...

I had my second experience at Omakase (Wisma Atria) recently. I ordered the Deluxe Cheeseburger (medium-well) with Cheese Fries and Root Beer Float.In my previous visit I ordered the Beef Tallow Fries (available only on weekends at Wisma Atria outlet) with the same burger.The taste of the beef patty is truly exquisite, and medium-well done to perfection. As you may have experienced, some other food places may not do a good job for their beef rareness but definitely not Omakase!The fries were of good quality, not oily and good taste. However, I think I preferred the Beef Tallow fries from my first visit. I did feel that the burger size is too tiny for it's price, while the fries portion was the opposite - quite a big portion! Overall the pricing of the food is on the high side.The rootbeer float had a generous topping of delicious softserve ice cream. In fact I appreciated the softserve A LOT. Much more than the rootbeer, which was unfortunately served out of a can of cheap root beer that you can get from the supermarket for under S$1. I didn't like that serving-the-can part at all!Must commend the service staff, they were very efficient in their work, plus there were surprising attempts at engagement in a conversation by the older lady who came to clear our table. Nice touch
4
The beef patty is quite fresh and nice. . The burger is a bit small in size. French fries is a bit soggy. Home made lemonade is very good. . However the price is a bit pricey. . Total bill for Omakame Cheeseburger, French fries and lemonade comes for SGD 21.5
3
The last time we came qa in 2014 when it first opened and we had to queue to get a seat.Now you can just walk in...I can see why...basically the novelty has worned off and the quality of the food and service decreased.They forgot our drinks until the food is ready which was a good 15mins. The lady who prepared the drinks didn't even aplogise (it was a simple lemonade and a can of root beer...how difficult can it be...)The $23+ burger was nice but not gourmet level stuff to charge such a Hugh price for it.Overall still edible but don't expect to see much change from $50 for 2 meals and drinks
3
OK the applewood smoked bacon was crispy and tasty but 110SGD for a burger meal with 3 kids and not feeling completely full is not ideal, even eating every last one of the fries. Incidentally for same family of 5, we paid only 52SGD at Universal Studios ... even the theme park was half the price, not that inferior and kids got a collector toy. MELBURNIANS ... with all our gourmet burger offerings, don't bother with this overpriced offering.The beef lard fries were no different to the regular fries, to be honest we didn't know which plate was which ... I would have preferred an extra serve of onion rings.The house lemonade was sour and tasted more artificial than the hyped up "house made" label suggested.I wish I had just gone upstairs to the food court for a big plate of Char Kuay Teow ..
3
The entire bill came up to $52 for two of us. This was a burger, side and soft drink for each of us. Yes the bun was 2 years in making and it was good. We asked for medium and medium well cooked patties and they both came out mediumRare .. It was a flavors some burger. Onion rings was good and so was the cheesy fries . At this price you would expect table service - not order at counter and get given a beeper to collect . For the price you would also expect a bigger size burger! Maybe it's the Orchard road rent factored into the price..
3
Get ready to hit the food court upstairs afterwards because the burgers are pretty small. Tasty but small. Fries are boring and avoid the cheese fries as they are smothered with processed cheese. A bit pricey ... so while I don't regret trying them .... I won't be back
3
I hate malls. Now that's said lets get on to the food. The burger appealed to me because of the white fluffy simple style bun. I had a regular beef burger which was decent enough. I'm happy with a burger but they never last long enough especially in my hands. One issue was that it was too juicy and wasn't at the same time. The juice had collected at the bottom of the wrapping that holds your burger and if you're not careful you'll have a lap of juice like my wife did.The homemade lemon tea was ok. Not sugary and dos have some nice tea flavour. The beef dripping fries were not particularly flavoursome, just like regular fried fries. So it gets a review of between average (as the average in Singapore is constantly disappointing) and very good. But it's not very good so only gets 3/5. And a bit overpriced
5
This place is really worth trying! I've read about it but never had a chance to try it for myself till yesterday. We ordered an Ultimate, a cheeseburger and an Applewood smoked bacon burger plus a cheese fries and a truffle fries and lychee teas. All our orders were so delicious we were fighting for the food hahaha... the burger buns is truly soft and the burgers which we ordered medium was flowing with red juices yums! The fries were superb! The lychee teas were not too sweet and you can really taste the tea leaves. This place is worth spending your money
3
If you're looking for a pretty decent burger and fries around Orchard, this is a pretty good place, but quite expensive. Expect to spend about SGD25 for your meal without drinks. They'll customize the order any way you want and have different kinds of burgers & fries to choose from. I was a little surprised when I found one small slice of tomato inside my burger but they were able to correct that by giving me extra when I asked. Hopefully this isn't a regular occurence. Taste-wise, it was good except I prefer my meat well-done. It would've been nice if they offered that choice. Fries were decent as well. Aside from the tomato incident, I'll still be back.
4
Situated in the middle of Wisma Atria mall really gets you some attraction eh?
Besides, I really want to try this thinking that it has Japanese quality and turns out that it's pretty nice!
Had the pork burger with french fries!
4
Truffle fries and cheese burger is great juicy and sumptuous. What else to say... yeah price may be an issue though as it is in the high end. For once a month treat, why not?! The ambience is great. Food is great.
1
You basically pay $16 for a mcdonald quality burger. The $7 "beef tallow fries" did not have any taste of beef tallow at all, and were worse than the ones at mcdonalds.
4
So delicious and flavourful! A bit expensive but its worthy, Its a self service make sure you know how to carry a bar tray :-) Next time will visit again for their rootbeer float.
4
I enjoyed the juicy smashed medium rare beef patty inside the burger. The meat juices gathered in the little paper wrap in which the burger is housed & that told me that these guys take their burgers very very seriously. The patties feel fresh. The bread is firm yet soft. Sometimes the legend obscures the actual quality of the product & after reading about the hoo-haa associated with this joint, I am glad to say I am reasonably satisfied. However, for the price at which they're selling their burgers, it's a tad bit disappointing that the size of the sandwich is unfathomably small. Those on a budget might want to steer away from this place but it's legit if you've got the moolah & aren't too hungry - head here for a quick bite
1
For $18:50, you would expect a decent sized burger with fries and maybe even some salad by the side and not a tiny $5 foodcourt burger that you can down in 5 bites. This burger hardly filled my hand let alone my stomach. The meal left me feeling cheated for the price could have left me more satisfied if I had gone to Macdonalds. You have been warned!!
3
I tried the original omakase burger - medium rare, The beef was really tender and juicy. Beware of the juice that might actually flow out of the paper wrapper. The beef tallow fries were just normal fries. I couldnt taste any beef. The truffles fries from the next table smelt quite nice. Probably you should go for that instead if you wanted to eat fries. Mexican coke?.. dont order that. tastes like ordinary coke but 5 times the price. Advice: just try the burger... Its a nice place to sit and chill though. comfy chairs
5
We have visited this place for quite some time now and we keep coming back. In its simplicity, it is in our opinion one of the best hamburger place in Singapore.The burgers are not too big, yet they are packed with a mix of great flavors, from the applewood smoked bacon to the evenly melted American cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms. It is always amazing to observe the meat juices oozing out after your first bite.We ordered the Ultimate (everything in) and the Deluxe Cheeseburgers, two of our favorite from the small but decent selection available. On the downside, it is kind of pricey for a "fast-food" style restaurant (we paid SGD 47.50 for two burgers and non-alcoholic drinks), considering that the table service is non-existing (you have to collect your order at the counter) and the cutlery is reduced to the minimum. Nevertheless, we will be back
1
Had my first Omakase burger last week. Should have read more review before ordering. Indeed it's totally overrated. I ordered a smoked bacon cheese burger honestly Its only better than a fast food burger. A note to all, if you want to try a better burger then go to Berg's the prices are lower and the burgers are bigger and tastier. The meat are also well barbecue and hot when served
3
After watching the programme on TV about the best burgers in Singapore. I decided to try their signature burger. It's nice but kind of pricey for its sheer size. Beef patty was good and flavourful, bun was warm and soft. Overall it's good but can be better !!
4
Enjoyed this place for sure. Good Burger but as others say they are not very big but yet it was a perfect meal size. Way, way better than fast food! Try the sweet potato fries...they are fantastic!
4
Expensive.. A burger without a set is somewhere around 14~18 sgd if i remember correctly.
But the burger is so good. I love it personally.
you can choose how you want the patty to be cooked, like medium or well-done.
4
After travelling in Vietnam for a couple of weeks, we were ready for a burger. We traipsed up and down Orchard Road on a hot and humid evening until we finally found Omakase. It was worth it. Although the location isn't all that exciting - it's in a shopping mall - the staff were really friendly and the burgers were awesome. I'd highly recommend Omakase Burger, especially if you're hanging out for western food
5
If you like thin patty, super juicy burgers, this is one of the best in the world. Pair it with the truffle fries and you've got yourself glutonous divinity. If there were 2 chain restaurants you must try in Singapore, it would be Din Tai Fung and Omakase. Neither will ever let you down
5
My husband and I are American expats living in Australia, and we heard about Omakase when watching Food Wars Asia on the Food Network. We randomly came across it when we were shopping on Orchard Road and decided to give it a try for dinner. The burgers and fries were DELICIOUS and just like some of the best burgers we have at home. The homemade fresh lemonade was great too. We loved it so much that we went back for another dinner when we returned to Singapore after our cruise. We had queues both times we went, but it moved quickly and the staff ensures you have a table ready after you order. We would definitely go back for another burger the next time we visit Singapore
4
Went there on CNY day 1, there is no long que. They use self-service with buzzer that will tell you when ur food is done . The burger is quite small for the price of a fast food restaurant. But its worth to try because the burger is good.
2
Having heard good reviews, I gave it a try. I order the Ultimate burger and fries. what a shock when the burger came out to be so tiny. I think Big Mac, whopper or Carls Jr burger is so much bigger. The burger was so-so. Nothing really fantastic. For those who tried Burger Fuel from NZ, that was way better. I definitely wont patronize the place again. its far too expensive for a tiny burger
3
On Friday 12:30. the place was surprisingly not packed and without queues.The Ultimate burger was fine as were the fries.Orange juice was fresh and cold. location is convenient and not too noisy.I thought it was reasonably priced as many cafe serve burgers that cost more than $20.However, I do think my own home made burgers following Martha Stewart recipe online is better. Plus I bake my own sweet potato frie
2
I heard about this famous burger joint and thought to give it a try. Saw the long queue so it thought it should be good. I ordered the chicken burger, large sweet potatoes and my husband ordered the applewood bacon burger. When I saw the burger, what a small serving! I was so surprised how tiny the burgers were and we paid like $18 each. Taste was just average. Obviously someone who wrote a review about this burger joint on the magazine they displayed at the counter hasn't absolutely visited many burger joints. At least the sweet potatoes weren't too bad. Definitely not coming back!
3
Went for dinner with at Omakase Burger joint at Wisma Atria level 1 on Saturday. Nothing to shout about on the taste of burgers. Honestly, the burger came in a small portion, taste wise as mentioned nothing to shout about but price wise, there were everything to scream about.I personally felt that it's overpriced! 5 of us are almost $130, just for burgers some fries and drinks. Lemonade was filled with full of ice and after 2 sucks, end of drink. I would not recommend if you have a budget to work on but if you have extra money and willing to splurge, then by all means. I would try other burger outlets with more reasonable pricing and portion. Hope this is helpful. ☺️☺️☺
4
One of the best juicy burger in Singapore , have to try their famous Omakase Applewood Smoke burger . The meat is so delicious and make you to forget another street burger
4
Burgers are delicious but overpriced for such a small portion. I ordered 2 burgers to make sure my tank gets filled. Awesome cheese fries.
3
The signature Omakase burger is a nice balanced flavour with cheese, lettuce, mustard and most importantly a juicy beef pattie which pulls all the components together. Me only grouse is that the burger is on the small side.The beef tallow fries looked and tasted to much like the normal fries. Go for the truffle or sweet potato instead.2 adults and 1 kid cost us SG$58 for 2 adult burgers, fries to share, 2 drinks and and kids cheeseburger combo
4
I heard a lot about Omakase burger so i decided to give it a try. While it does serve a good burger (i had the applewood bacon cheeseburger) i wouldn't say it is to die for. Maybe it was because i had already had lunch before trying it. Overall it was a good burger and definitely better than the average burger joint, especially in Singapore
2
Ate here on a whim. Regretted it. Small servings, and expensive.A newspaper clipping claim the made-in-house burger bun is to die-for. I think it was a paid article. While the meat patties were juicy, the buns are tasted like typical cheap supermarket bought buns. I also ordered the recommended 'tallow-drip' french fries. It tasted below average, so I thought they got the order wrong. As for another serving, and it still tasted underwhelming. The fries from MacD tasted better.Overall service was slow, and the meal was pricey for burger joint. I could have eaten better at one of the local western-food restaurant. Or go for a better value and tasting MacD gourmet burge
1
Hi. We visited last night. We are vegetarian. They have a vegetarian burger but it was mushroom. My husband doesn't eat mushrooms so we asked for a burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese and grilled onions (like an in n out grilled cheese burger!) I had the mushroom burger. $50 later - so poor value for money. They charged my husband the same price for his burger (minus the patty), no cheese, scant piece of lettuce, tomato and onion, teeny tiny bun. The mushroom patty I had was terrible, just oily. What a serious waste of money.
5
This is a casual dining place inside the Wisma shopping mall. You will often see people lining just to get a seat into it. That keep me wondering. After trying their cheeseburger for the first time, I totally understood why. They used quality beef, they made it tender and pretty juicy. The selected cheese went very well with it. Their premium omakase bun was being created after taken hundreds of hours of research. Overall the burger quality is truly as close as the Shake Shack in New York City. However the price is definitely way higher with Omakase in terms of the size of the burger. I don't recall have to pay so much for Shake Shack in the Big Apple and even their other branch in Dubai Airport. It was way cheaper compared to Omakase. For the price you pay, you could really get a nice burger in a proper restaurant/ bar instead.If you are a big beef burger fan in Singapore, probably give it a try once anyway. Yon't regret the few bites you have
1
Ordered 2 burgers (one cheeseburger, 1 bacon cheeseburger), a side of cheese fries, 2 drinks and one small bun for our infant. Total bill: SGD$52.00. What was received was un-impressive, tiny burgers which admittadly seemed of high quality, just really lacking in value. Drinks took a long time to receive.They put the small bun for my baby on my bacon cheeseburger and gave the larger bun on the side... staff didn't do much more than giggle about that
3
Was introduced to this fancy burger joint reputed to have the best burgers in town. On the menu, there are many choices of designer burgers that we can select from. What distracted me from making my choices was the astronomical prices! I was tempted to walk away but could not resist a designer burger that caught my eye - the vegetarian burger! It was mushroom-based. For the price of $16.90 for the burger, I would expect the size of the burger to be decent. Boy, was I wrong! It was small, way smaller than a Mac!! In my books, it is more of a slider. My tummy was only 1/3 filled!! What a great dissapoinment! The only saving grace - the taste of the burger was excellent, which kind of assuage my incredulity at the volume of food I am getting for that princely sum I just parted!! Besides the taste, what I like was the free flow of mustard, chili sauce and ketchup, and water! Would I go back again? Maybe, after my bonus award!
4
We tried Omakase burger for dinner and enjoyed it very much. I had the "ultimate cheeseburger" topped with cheese, applewood smoked bacon, grilled onions and mushrooms. I should say the flavor seemed a tad bland on my first bite, but I went to the counter where many condiments are available and added a little mustard, pickles, and salt and pepper and it was much tastier. My husband had a bacon cheeseburger and we both agreed the size of both burgers was just right. Sometimes burgers can be too big. My favorite thing about the burger was the texture of the patty. You could tell it was handmade. The onion rings were good, but I can't recommend the cheese fries. The flavor of the cheese sauce just didn't appeal to us. Homemade lemonade was excellent
4
Definitely more than ordinary burger in the fast food restaurant. Can taste the fresh meat in the burger. Juicy but not oily at all. All is made fresh. It is worth waiting for. A&W root bear float is as good as the original A&W
4
These burgers were delicious and juicy. Variety of burgers available with chips. Portion is big but price is also a bit too much. Would've been 5 star otherwise.
4
Very juicy and delicious burgers although a bit small in size. Tasty fries and great orange juice. Overall the price is a bit expensive but honestly the burgers are just so great that we didn't mind paying the price.
4
For "fast-food" the burgers are slightly expensive starting at $14 SGD, however, once you dig into the tender rolls, fresh vegetables and incredibly tasty burger, you will forgive the self-service fast-food atmosphere. The value is there by far!! And the fries are excellent as well. The closest thing to the U.S. small chain "In N Out Burger" I have ever run into
4
When in Singapore and you are looking for a great burger Omakase is the place to go. a great simple concept - very selective menu order and wait. The burgers are excellent so are the fries, the is not McDonalds or Burger King the food is excellent so be prepared to pay for that. Great place for a great burger
3
I like this place for weekday lunch but was surprised when I went last week that things seems to that this have slipped a bit - they were out of the applewood smoked bacon that is so tasty, and the bun on my (replacement) bacon cheeseburger was edging towards stale... Flavors were still delicious as always, and I will probably try again, but this visit last week wasn't as memorable as usual..
5
wow what can i say i visit singapore once a year to visit my best mate annas dad, and now its all i think about. burgers are small but so tasty one is just not enough make sure u add a side of cheese n truffle fries.............ALLTIM
5
The Omakase Burgers are great! They are that kind of burgers that you need fork & knife to eat them because they are huge. In fact they are almost the same size as a Macdonald's quarter pound. The patties are 100% good quality lean beef and the bums are soft. They have one option with applewood somed bacon that's delicious. The fries are excellent and there's an option with buffalo wings sauce and cheddar cheese and bacon that is my favorite. They serve Mexican Coca-Cola on a bottle that's much less sweet than the regular Coke. Probably one of the Top 5 burgers in Singapore
4
Omakase Burger has become a weekly ritual which is great for my belly but may not be that great for my heart! I'm almost always here on Tuesdays around 7pm. It is free seating but we've never had issues finding a table - once it was more packed than usual and one of the servers helped to facilitate which was great.My boyfriend always orders the Omakase Cheese Burger (medium rare) and sometimes I have the Omakase Chicken Sandwich, always with an order of french fries and root beer float. I'd say that the cheese burger is in between Shake Shack's and In-N-Out's (but definitely way more expensive at $15) and you do have to tilt your burger sideways to make sure the meat juice do not soak through the artisanal bun or it'd become a greasy mushy bun and to make sure it does not get on your clothes. Sounds like the meat patties can do with a little resting before being served. The chicken sandwich is a pan-fried breaded chicken fillet, which does not have the same juiciness as a KFC Zinger Burger, but juicy for chicken fillet and probably healthier (it's all relative, right?). The fries are reminiscent of McDonald's fries, but we both love McDonald's fries so no problem there.FYI this place is pretty much self-service: after you order, you pick up your drinks first, then the food when the buzzer rings
3
Heard of them and decided to try the burgers with a friend. The beef burgers tasted great and juicy. However they run on the pricey side just for 2 petite burgers. The queueing system was not very ideal as well as customers tend not to have a place to sit after placing their orders. This may be an issue they should look into
5
It was my third time having lunch here. their ultimate burger with applewood bacon is always be my favourite menu. not to forget their truffle fries. located in wisma atria in the heart of orchard road. easy to find
5
Went on a whim, before a movie. But will definitely go again for the Burgers. Delicious! Even had my wife licking her lips and she was not very enthusiastic to start with.
5
This was the second time we ate here. The burgers are absolutely one of the best I have ever tasted, the fries were perfectly cooked, and the orange juice was amazing, apparently 4 1/2 oranges goes into one large orange juice. If you order medium-well done, you get medium-well done...these guys really know how to do it right. The only thing is that the burgers could be bigger and the price quite expensive. However, because my family and I love the food we will be back for more
4
I really enjoyed the burger and accompaniments. We had ordered some sweet potato fries and onion rings - which were all sufficiently tasty in their own right. Though on the small side, burgers are juicy and succulent.Orange juice was to my surprise delicious. Overall for burger fans in Singapore this is a must try
3
Just happened to be in the area after taking the SMRT and saw this restaurant in the corner. Since we are needing of a snack and rest went in and ordered some food & drinks. You order in the counter and wait and get it when ready. We ordered 2 sets of Cheeseburgers with onion rings, sweet potato fries and some drinks. I cannot really compare it to the burgers I had in the US. For one thing it is rare to find good beef in Asia and if you get one, it is very expensive. Service could also be improved. Anyways, it was okay but nothing special and not good value for the amount we paid for

Came here after reading a random news article declaring this to be the best overall burger in Singapore. Ehhh...It certainly was good burger, but somehow I don't think it's at the level of being the best. The components were great, but it somehow leaves me unsatisfied, since I've had good burgers in NY, Chicago, London and Sydney.I had the special smoked bacon cheeseburger with normal fries (really should have tried the cheese fries, maybe next time).- The bun was soft but had good structural integrity. Thankfully it's wasn't a silly over the top brioche, which I find annoying in burgers.- The bacon was good and crispy, with the fat mostly rendered out. Good execution. There also wasn't too much or too little of it, which was good.- The cheese was the standout for me, it really was good american cheese.- The beef was the one that disappointed me the most. I'm the kind of person that first eats the salad in the burger to get rid of them (hate them in burgers, useless distractions), so I was initially quite exciting at having tasted good beefy drippings flavour from the lettuce. But after biting into the beef, I was somewhat disappointed at the lack of beefy flavour - it's as if it all left the burger already. I suspect it is because the beef portion was quite small - if it was a little bigger and thicker, it might be better. Still, I do get jolts of beefy flavour every few bites, so it wasn't a complete loss.I also would have expected the burger to be bigger for the price.Also, I detest that paper covering on the burger, and the basket. The way it was loaded caused most of the fillings to slide out into the inner corner of the paper, which caused a bit of mess for me trying to make it concentric again. Get bigger baskets and just load it flat!So my search for a go-to burger place in Singapore continues. So far the main contender is Bergs in Far East Square, though the beef in Omakase is better. I just prefer Bergs for better value since it seems to leave me more satisfied after eating

We like the Omakase Burger at Turf Club so it was great to see this second one open. The burgers here are just as delicious as the original and there are a couple of unique items here vs Turf Club, and of course the atmosphere is different because it's in a mall. This is my weekday Omakase Burger and the original is for weekends..

We'd tried everything from high-end to hawkers, happened to be in the mall and saw this restaurant. The menu looked good and quite varied. We succumbed to the hype and had an applewood smoked-bacon cheeseburger, an ultimate cheeseburger, cheesy fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings. Our bill came to approx $S60 (Â£30) with drinks.The burgers were tasty, cooked as we'd requested, so with just a hint of pink showing in the middle, and they were a satisfying size. The chips and onion rings were fab, with a real homemade taste to them. Yummy!People have said you'd be as well going to McDonalds but I highly doubt that unless you've got children with you who just MUST have the latest Happy Meal toy or you really do just want quick, cheap and cheerful, mass-produced, same all over the world type food. Actually, McD's isn't even as cheap as it used to be for what you get so strike that. I can't deny, however, that the burgers here are a bit pricey and thus the average rating. We'd expect to pay these prices in Scotland but we'd be eating it in a pub setting or in a specialist burger chain like Gourmet Burger, rather than in a restaurant in a mall, and we'd probably still be moaning that it was expensive for a burger!So, if you just need to fill a hole in your tum, McDonalds it is, but if you fancy a tasty burger and can get over the price, try here

Some online reviews have this chain as a good place to get a burger. Honestly, I wish I'd ordered room service in the hotel. For what you get here, it's ridiculously expensive. The burgers are ordinary and the buns? The bread obviously caters more to Asian tastes but the buns are a bit of nothingness. We ordered a small truffle fries for a side dish and they were oily and the truffle flavour tasted very, very fake. If you're a hamburger fan, you'll leave here very disappointed.

Good burgers, but not the best in Singapore (as some websites have highlighted recently). However, the burgers are great, and the selection of fries and sides are great. The sweet potato friend and cheese fries are delicious. Go here, just to have these. For me, the sides were the main dish, and the burgers were secondary. And there's usually too much of a waiting

I am not usually negative on Trip Advisor, but this place was really bad. Good burgers are hard to find in Singapore as a general rule, but don't start searching here. You are better off at McDonald's, and I hate McDonalds!

We are regulars to Omakase (originally Turf City location after soccer games), and now Wisma Atria (because we can walk there). We are greeted with, "hello, Mr. Bill". Yep, we must be regulars. The burgers are seasoned well and the (regular) fries are delicious. The only negative here is the price of the food, but keeping in mind the ingredients are from the US. It's the closest thing to a good ol' American burger we've found here in Singapore

I was looking to eat a good cheeseburger, so I did the research and found Omakase. The burger itself was fantastic as were the onion rings. The service is decent as well. My only complaint was price, but that seems to be the norm in Singapore, so don't hold it against the restaurant. Overall, a great place to eat

I like burgers and decided to try Omakase Burgers since it was billed as one of the "best burgers in Singapore".I had the Applewood Bacon Cheeseburger, which was only available at the Wisma Atria branch. The bacon itself was a little dry and I didn't find it special. As for the patty, it was soft to the point of being too mushy and the taste of the beef didn't really come through. And I paid S$17.90 for all that?There are definitely better burgers out there and I'm not going back to Omakase

It's my favorite burger in Singapore though it's a little costly. It's burger is hand make and taste deliciously juicy and tasty. I ask for well done and it's still really tender and good. I order a omakase cheese burger ($14.90), a truffles fries which is very good ($7.00) and a coke light. Must try for all burger lovers. Location is at wisma atria (orchard road) and another location is turf city

I am writing this review 2 months after my visit to Omakase only because I saw it win the FoodWars Asia challenge against Fatboy's. I haven't been to Fatboy's but since it lost to Omakase, it must be pretty bad. (I'd still give it a shot though) For Omakase, it is merely OVERPRICED. Nothing too special. I wouldn't suggest you visit. Save your $$$. Go to an American fastfood. It might just offer you something better.

Well let's start by stating, I am from the US so what I am looking for in a burger may be different. Is it the best I have ever had, no but better then most burgers I have had in Singapore. I enjoy a burger that has some flavor and is moist, US style. Great fries also. They are not cheap, but I'll go back

My husband and I finally decided to try this restaurant. The first time we tried to eat there were were told they do not serve food in the afternoon so we had to go back in the evening which is very strange!!We ordered the chicken sandwich and Applewood Bacon Combo Burger with salad and cheesy fries and orange juice. It cost us $54!!!! Such rubbish food! Really bad chicken sandwich - all I could taste was chicken skin. Both burgers were like a cheap school meal burger. I cannot believe we wasted $54 in this place. And the whole system is just ridiculous and confusing with the queuing up and the ordering system and picking up the food. It's just like an expensive food court but with really rubbish overpriced food. Never again. I would rather go to McDonalds as it's much better food!

Decided to give it a try since people raving about it so much...Some even considered it as the "Best burger in SG".As recommended, i ordered "Omakase Applewood Smoked Bacon Cheeseburger", with fries as a side dish, juicy,with thick- cut bacon, perfect size with great bread. The fries are great as well. But definitely not the best burger in Singapore....Overall, Omakase Burgers are in a class on its own...

Such good food! It's not an average burger. It's wet and saucy and dripping with cheese. There are as close to Steak'n'Shake burgers as we've found outside of the US. A little expensive but they are very tasty. Honourable mention to the sweet potato fries too
