I ordered chicken with black sause and it was good. The black sause is a little sweet, good mix with rice and chicken. The soup is okay. I especially like the chilly sauce. I think the restaurant is a good choice.

Really good crispy pork, nice and tasty chicken rice (goes very well with the lemon lemonade) and a delicious hainan chicken. I liked the hainan chicken especially, because it was possible to order it without bones :)

This was a family favourite for many years and it has been quite a few years since we were there.It can get pretty crowded on weekends so we picked a work day and got there at about 11.30.Service was prompt and our orders were quickly taken. We asked for a plate of chicken for two, some oyster sauce vegetables, and a serve of char siew pork. Soup was complimentary.The chicken was as good as we remembered. Just cooked, succulent, tender and full of flavour. The char siew was very well done, nicely spiced and crisped just enoughfor texture and flavour. As always the vegetables were cooked to perfection.While this is not the cheapest way to eat good chicken rice, it is a place to go to for a special treat

My family's favourite go-to place for chicken rice ever since I was a kid. Both my parents have (separately) been going to this place since the 1970s. I'm not sure of my dad's current thoughts of this place, but it's still my mum's favourite.Our order is the same every time: soy sauce chicken, rice and an extra bowl of sauce only (to drizzle over rice) to share. The chicken is very tender and perfectly matches with the sauce. The rice is fragrant - I've had my record of downing 6 bowls of rice in a sitting when my usual maximum is 2 on hungry days! I'd say the sauce is the main star here, enhancing the flavours of both the rice and chicken to make it so special. I'm very glad the taste still remains the same, even after all these years

Soy Sauce Chicken is one of my favorite dishes and Lee Fun Nam Kee is one of the best in Singapore for that. Their chicken is juicy and plump, the thick sauce is different from what you get elsewhere but it tastes delicious. I usually order the Hor Fun because it is so soft and tender. Best of all, their standard has been consistently good throughout the years I've eaten there. As for the other meats, the Char Siew can be a little dry, not as fatty as I would like and the Roast Pork is pretty average. But hey, the Soy Sauce Chicken is the definite star here

Our family visited here for supper. We ordered steamed chicken, pork in soya sauce, Chicken in soy sauce, green veggies, along with the included soup, Ginger and chicken rice sauce. The portions were large and this proved to be a bit too much food for us. I think it would be better to order individual sets as this would provide enough to eat and be less expensive.The food was tasty and well prepared so we have no qualms on that front

Must eat here to get the best chicken rice I've ever eaten. This place solidifies chicken rice as the national dish of Singapore. The chicken is soft and melts in the mouth, even the normally dry breast. The roast pork has crunchy skin. The rice is tasty by itself. They've apparently been here for the past 40 years, and it shows in the quality of the dishes

I only go for the soya sauce chicken noodles. One plate SGD4.50, it is good price for its high quality of chicken - soft tender and smooth! Goes with lime juice, a perfect match! Shrimp dumpling is SGD5.00 but worth it since about 6pieces of dumpling and fully stuff meat/prawn + chestnut within each dumpling! Note: The thick soya sauce recipe is supposedly family secret! Tip: not to order family portion to be shared; cuz either portion too big or too expensive! Always order individual portion! We tried few times & learn the trick

Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes, but the food was at best, bland. The steamed chicken had good texture, but very little by way of flavour. The oyster sauce used on the kailan wasn't of good quality and was salty. The roast pork was average. The worst dish was the watercress soup, which tasted diluted and gingery. What was missing was the signature watercress flavour one associates with such a dish. Serving portions were large for four diners, so best to dictate the portions ordered, rather than to rely on the waitress' judgement. The only redeeming feature is the prompt service. Unlikely to eat here again.

Nice food especially the soya sauce chicken. Nice chicken quality. However, the price was very expensive and the restaurant staff gave us a large portion despite only 4 people. Like 12 large pieces of tofu. In conclusion, great food but not worth the money especially if you are on a Budget

Lee Fun Nam Kee's soya sauce chicken is excellent! The chicken meat is succulent and generously drenched in a secret-recipe sauce, which goes well with chicken rice or noodle. The pork belly is well roasted and delicious too.

Pretty good tasty chicken, breast meat was succulent. Nice vegetables too. A bit pricey, although the portions were generous. We had two portions of rice, chicken and vegetables, drinks of barley and lime juice, all for $28. My friend and I enjoyed it nonetheless.

The soya sauce chicken and rice are all nice, but what really got me was the awesome roasted pork! It was crispy and crackled in my mouth when I put it in my mouth. There is also dumpling soup on the menu, which is nice too. There is a take-away counter which makes it easy to just park next to the shop, hop out, place your order, then collect it and drive off

This place (Toa Payoh Lor4) has been around for many years. The chicken may not be the best but what I like is the sauce they have for the chicken and char shu. It's not too salty and good to have it on the rice. They serve also the noodle in place of rice for those who do not like to.Be careful when you order as they tends to give you very large portion. My suggestion is to order individual so that it will not burnt your pocket as it is very expensive.Parking is very convenient

Not one of the best soy sauce chickens but still I continue to patronized it due to convenience . Prices have gone up very much over the years and a double chicken wings noodle would cost you around $9.00 which is very steep in the area it is located .Food wise is above average and their gravy is good but leave you with a tasty throat

I have heard someone commented that the chicken rice was good. On a recent lunch, I decided to pop by to give it a try. The store occupies about 3 units at a corner of a HDB block. Car park is convenient with a multi storey car park right in front of the store.As we had some food before this, I ordered the soya sauce braised chicken drum stick. It came with a plate of rice and bowl of soup. It costs me $7.50. This is rather expensive, for chicken drumstick rice, and this is not even HDB Hub we are at. I was at Suntec City the next day and went to Food Junction, where Sergeant Chicken Rice was selling theirs for $6.The verdict? The chicken is good and tasty. Portion was also decent. The rice was flavourful, although personally, I found it a little ‘wet’. The chilli is nice and spicy.Overall a good plate of chicken rice, but price-wise, its steep

This humble chicken rice restaurant has been around for 40 plus years and even though I have traveled around the island to sample the "best rated" and most blogged chicken rice eateries, LFNK is still where I always go back to for Singapore's truly número uno chicken rice. It commanded a whole coffee shop space in the same Toa Payoh location for 40+ years, a feat not common back in those days and has remain loyal to its offering, ie the same humble soya sauced and boiled chicken, roasted meat and boiled veggies. It does not need to add gimmicks dishes like other newer chicken rice chains to draw in the crowd. LFNK has also not tweaked it's recipe to please the younger and healthier crowd because it's a family joint where multi generational families faithfully support it through the years. The soya sauced chicken is its star item beating those Cross Street siblings or the Chinatown stalls. But it's their boiled chicken that truly delivers succulent and juicy orgasmic pleasure in every bite. Their birds have been sourced from the same supplier all these years and are of a bigger size than all other places but LFNK somehow can bring out the tenderness that others can't.Even their boiled vegetables come laden with crunchy freshly fried lard bits that taste so sinfully good. Accompanying all these are their exquisite chilli sauce and flavorful rice for the perfect meal.So not for me those chain eateries or the Maxwell HC stall that parties with Anthony Bourdain or the fowl mouth Mr Ramsey (just go and try their Bedok stall that serves chicken from the fridge), I stay faithful to LFNK.Let you in on a secret, you can often rub shoulders with Mediacorp's stars and starlets during lunch hours

My good friend Singaporean introduced me to Lee Fun Nam Kee for lunch about 10 years ago and ever since i have been addictive to this restaurant, with at least once a week visit for lunch or dinner. I simply love the food here... it’s luscious and definitely worth coming to try it out... The chicken skin is smooth and not very oily. The dark sauce that they pour on the is very nice and it enhances the whole dish. The soup here is nice and fragrant. Vegetables. Not overcooked and the oyster sauce is nice. Kai Lan, comes with wicked pieces of pork lard. The Char Sui is savory with very nice crispy skin. The chicken with soy sauce was tender and moist. Loved it!. This chicken rice is class. No frills, just like how they used to make'em in the old days. Nothing superbly spectacular about it as a whole but you can tell that it's something special. this is where you will experience the sweetest chicken rice sauce ever. The restaurant began as a food stall in the old Toa Payoh Lorong 4 food centre in 1966 before moving to its current locationhighly recommended if you are looking for a nostalgic taste from the 1960s

I have been patronizing this place since I was a kid. The soya sauce chicken is favourful and the meat very tender. The gravy is thick and good. The chicken rice is fragrant. This is not Hainanese chicken but is more of the Cantonese variety. Although the soya sauce chicken is good, I actually enjoy the Char Siew. It is one of the best around. Good and friendly service. Highly recommended if you are in the area.

It's OK except that everything is sweet. The chicken sauce is sweet, the soup is sweet, the vegetable is sweet, the dumpling is sweet, the chili is sweet and the char siew is extremely sweet. I didn't manage to try the roast pork but I guess it's sweet too. However, the chicken meat is tender and I kind of like the hint of herbal taste. Other than that, I did get sick of the sweetness in everything.Worth the try if you have a sweet-tooth for everything
