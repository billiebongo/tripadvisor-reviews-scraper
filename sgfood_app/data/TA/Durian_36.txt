This durian stall is the best I ever visited. The young guy Ah Jiat is friendly and honest. I really enjoy eating there everyday after dinner.

因為係Geyland Road 剛好食了No Signboard Seafood 上網搜索附近榴槤好多！
好多款榴槤喎！
試了皇上皇(第二貴)，其實同D24一樣咁creamy。
下一次可以試最cheap個幾款，睇下係咪好似泰國個榴槤咁。
有水洗手的但是沒潔液。

Ever wonder why the durians are so expensive? Some are $18 a kg. Just for 1 fruit paid $35.Imagine this fruit only cost less than $10 malaysia ringgit. Seems like is a control and monopolise business. Big time money making business. Actually cost of durian is about 1/3
