Come here everytime i am in Singapore in the last 13 years and it never disappoint. Ate many places in the world, they have the best chicken tikka by far..
5
Great staff, amazing massala and Rogan josh- really loved the garlic naan and great drink selection. Very authentic and great part of Little India!
3
This is a great place for taking away some tasty north Indian food. The decor is pretty basic but was clean and comfortable. This is a good place if you are on a budget as the food is very reasonably priced.
4
Enjoyed the curry and tandori chicken. Ordered the garlic naan and thought it would be better if the garlic taste was stronger. Ordered coffee too; was nice.
3
Have been here few times, thinking this time food will be good and result is same, got disappointed every time
4
Simple order over the counter and self service place. All the tandoor dishes were really fresh and tasty. The prata and naans were served really fast and fresh. Not the place to look for ambience but overall good food. Reasonably priced and probably my favorite North Indian place.
5
Amazing food and very good value You need to know your Indian dishes as there are no menus, TIP review online prior to visit Self service, choose your dishes at the counter, pay and take your tray to a table to eatSimple but very effective

friend recommended this place. it's in the heart of little india, we walked past streets and rows of shop houses. the restaurant is moderate in size, with outside seating. it is clean and the trays of food are very appealing. although there are no names, I guess you could ask the uncle. my friend who has been there numerous times ordered the dishes. for 2 persons, we had 5 types of chicken dishes, a yogurt dish, a cauliflower dish and another vegetable dish. plus a pototo nann and a roti. all the helpings are in small plates, so it may take a lot of self control to not over order. I just ate what was ordered and it was all very delicious ! it is self service, you pay at the counter and carry your trays of food to your table. i have a fondness for north indian food, so may return to try the other stuff
4
The third time we went here in 2 months - and went away satisfied! Palak paneer, kadi pakoda and freshly made chapatis and pudina paratha- we really enjoyed it. It is NOT a fancy place- its self service and the folks are helpful when you ask what's available. If you want decent quality tasty home cooked style North Indian food in a simple setting- this is the place to g

Went here yesterday. I really like indian food, but I still don't know many dishes by their names. The place has no menu or labels on the food displayed. So you will have to order by looks. If it's busy it can be troublesome to ask what is what.However, since I was in company of desi people they ordered for me. Delicious paneer, potato-naan, and many other things I cannot describe.About half the options are veg. Naan comes fresh from tandoor super delicious. Some things are reheated in a microwave, but tastes awesome. Price is afforable, water from a jug and you have to get cutlery from a sidetable. We spent about 15$ per person, but we ate A LOT with some leftovers
4
Delicious dhaba style North Indian food with affordable price. I have been frequent traveler to Singapore for business trip and for dinner I always come here. This is not just favourite amongst Indian people, but I have seen local people coming here in good numbers.
2
So finally visited this place. It has moved to new location next to the Laxminaryan temple on Chander Road. This is more like upmarket hawker style restaurant . Since the food is pre cooked and displayed and all you need to do is order the dishes from the showcased pre cooked Menu. Everything is self service here. So don't expect to be served on your table except for Roti.We ordered some veg dishes like chana , mix Veg and palak paneer, daal and Roti. Channa seemed to be stale. Mix Veg was quite good. Palak paneer was okay with small 1-2 pieces of paneer. Overall the meal for two cost is 22+ SGD. it was a Saturday lunch time and I was looking for a good meal but I was bit disappointed. May be cause I came with high expectation. Anyways this place is good option if you want a quick meal. I didn't try their Non Veg. It looked good especially their butter chicken. I shall visit this place next only for Non Veg food and see how it goes.
5
We came across this restaurant accidentally while sightseeing Little India. From the outside, we saw lots of Indians and foreigners alike. The food was displayed on a buffet and the waiter was kind enough to give us a simplified translation of the food. We had channa masala (chickpea curry), cheese curry, rice and roti. Highly recommended
5
Love their Chana, Dahi wada and Palak paneer/saag. What makes the meal perfect is they serve hot and crispy rotis. And the prices are affordable as well, they used to serve food at Changi Signature building and I was regular there but now that they have closed, I have been to their restaurant near raffles place but they don't have much space there and it gets really hot and suffocated to sit and have lunch. But the quality of food is same. I am hoping race course road will has the same taste and quality of food
2
Naans and Rotis are freshly baked. They have a good selection of tandoori meat, gravies, and curries. Their butter chicken is amazingly delicious and creamy. But unfortunately, most dishes, especially the tandoori meat are microwaved just behind the food counter before serving. Reheating a dish tends to give you the uncertainty on the freshness of the food and when it was last cooked. The portions are small, and pricey. But other than that, the food is delicious
3
I looked forward to finally trying Jaggi's, which was recommended by a friend. The dishes offered are authentic North Indian. The tandoori dishes are very appealing in appearance, some of the best I've seen in Singapore. However, my anticipation was soon let down when the waiter placed the chicken tikka in the microwave. Perhaps some do not mind the usage of the microwave because the tandoori dishes are already prepared but need to be warmed up. However, it sends a loud message to the customer about the quality of the food preparation. Microwave ovens should never be used unless it is considered fast food and I hope Jaggi's is able to make the change. I enjoyed the vegetable korma, the garlic naan and chapati are superb and made fresh. Don't forget the mango lassi! Except for the microwave usage, I highly recommend Jaggi's
3
This review is for the AXA tower location.Location trumps taste by a stretch in this little joint. This place is certified B, and they take that very seriously. Day old panneer is pretty standard. Being a vegetarian the choice is quite limited and quite pricey for small portions. But for its perfect location I would not recommend it at all. The owner is quite rude with customers. Do not go in for taste, service, or price, go for the convenient location for those working near Tanjong Pagar
5
this place changed locations over the past 5-6 years, across lanes in the same vicinity....but it is one joint you shld not miss visiting, esp if you are a visiting Indian and want to taste some authentic Indian food. They pretty much have a authentic Punjabi fare, with Naans, Rotis and Parathas (weekends), some very good subzis including Paneer, Channa, Aloo Gobi, and the Daal accompaniments including yellow and black both. Do try the Green pepper OR Bitter Gourd kebabs as well - extremely well made most of the time. This is an amazing place, rightly priced and very fast in serving. I have reviewed only the Vegetarian cuisine as I am a hardcore Veggie, but am more than sure from what i see around inside this place, the Non-vegetarian is just as great if not better
4
One of my relative recommended this place to us and we decided to go here. From out side you will not realize that this will be the place to eat and get good food. But when you go in and have food you will realize it. They have both veg and non-veg good choices. Taste is excellent with good home made kind of touch. They offer some sweet dish as well. Serve you hot Chapati/Roti which is assume. Prices wise also it is very good. For our stay of 5 days , we visited this place 3 times.I must mention. In our group couple of friends got slipped and the food felt down. Owner was kind enough not to charge for that food. Highly recommended if you are in Singapore Tour. If you are in group , then this is your choice
5
You order at the counter and get served some delicious Indian food. I am always on the lookout for good naan, which they make when you order. The butter chicken was excellent and well spiced. The portions aren't huge, but what I had filled me up
5
good, authentic Punjabi food. The potion is quite less though. One looking for fine dining may look for other places. The non veg food is quite tasty and has authentic taste,
4
I use to go there whenever i got chance for meal. Best place for north Indian food. Paratha , daal , naan everything was delicious on affordable price. Very good service too. Opening more branches soon. Keep it up.
4
The branch outlet at CBD prompted me to go to the main outlet in Little India for lunch . Definitely it was not a disappointment and the food was definitely worth the money . Very pocket friendly it was truly authentic North Indian. Not a great ambience but best if you are looking for good food
5
Every time i visit Singapore i make sure i visit Jaggi's. One of the oldest Indian restaurant in Singapore. When you are jet lagged and off your flight & confused with what to eat visit Jaggi's and you will get home style cooked food. Delicious and super quality food PLUS value for money meal. We spent around SGD 26 and had pretty much everything on table enough for 2 adults one 4 yr old child + over eating ; )They are not located at the address mentioned just behind this street mentioned though
4
We recently had lunch here, it had a good variety to pick from at the front counter and they make your rotis and naan to order. The food was delicious and very tasty. The service and ambience was average, water was available at the counters (self service).
3
First off, Jaggi's has moved to Chander Road. I've heard so much about Jaggi's from my Indian expat friends who come here for their "comfort food". Quite frankly, the food itself isn't that bad. What disappointed me the most was how frequently the microwave oven, which is right behind the food warmers was used. We ordered Naan, which was made fresh but dishes like Mutton Keema, Aloo Gobi were all served lukewarm. I ordered lamb kebabs, and it went straight into the microwave oven.I had assumed the tandoori chicken would be freshly made, but alas that too went into the microwave. For the prices we paid, which was pretty close to a fine-dining restaurant I had certainly hoped for better. Perhaps Jaggi's should rename itself as Jaggi's Microwave Cuisine
4
We tried some of my favourite punjabi dishes and a few new ones. First of all I will start with the better dishes. The vegetable korma is excellent, and the aloo gobi and pindi cholle is very good. I usually eat peshwari naan bread (a Pakistani naan bread) when available, but I was recommended the kashmiri (dried fruit) naan as it is northern Indian cuisine. We were happy with the recommendation because it was delicious. The only dishes that disappointed us were the pilau rice and butter chicken dishes. I think they were average at best as I've eaten these dishes in many restaurants. Overall the food is a 3.5/5 and I would happily eat here again.I would recommend to try the dishes we enjoyed and just avoid the butter chicken dish. The curry was very thin and it had a soup like texture.The staff were very friendly and I enjoyed talking about different Asian cuisine with them. I would say that it is good value for money for lunch, and I'm not sure about the dinner service. Maybe we will try dinner next time we visit Singapore
4
How lucky that we found this place. The food was really good, tasty and spicy enough to still enjoy it . Nicely served and fresh. If I had the chance, I would come back to eat here. Note: We are from USA and we are used to eat indian food every week
4
For typical punjabi food this is the best place in Singapore. Amazing dal roti. Baigan. Karela aloo gobhi. Missi roti tandoori food. Lachar prantha. Tandoori roti nan. Chiken . Beer and sweet. Right now they are little india until there other race corse road place is ready. In front of imperial hotel parking. Only disappointing was small cockroaches
4
Jaggi's has moved to 34-36 Chandar Road. This location is about 5 minutes walking distance from their old address. The new premises is more refined, almost like a fine dining restaurant, except that you still pay your food at the counter before you start, and collect your own food. This helps to keep the overheads low.If you want to taste authentic Punjabi food, then Jaggi's is the place for you. I go to Jaggi's for the chappati and keema (minced mutton curry). I have introduced a number of my friends to their food.They also have chicken tikka marinated in various ways: regular, lemon garlic, yogurt, fenugreek, and mint.Nice ambience, friendly staff, worth the visit
4
We have been on Sunday lunch. Good Indian food. Nice atmosphere. The area is pleasant to have a walk around. Recommended place to visit.
5
A regular visitor of this place regardless of where they move. Love the choices and idea of ordering smaller portions giving us having many side orders instead of just one or Two. Cheap, quick and tasty food.
Must visit if you are in Singapore
4
Visited the place with my local friend who recommended it.
The food was tasty n very authentic and enjoyable..
Self service but hot rotis were served on the table..
Affordable as per Singapore rates ..
5
There are so many 'authentic' Indian restaurants in SG ( especially in and around Little India), it is tough to find a place which is truely authentic. Enter the Jaggis (at Chander Road), which serves amazing north indian(especially Punjabi) food at an affordable price.Fixed Menu on display==================Pick what you want...Starters (my favourites)=====================Chicken/ Mutton Sheek KebabsChicken TikkaChicken Reshmi KebabChicken HariyaliMain Course==========Butter Chicken ( Really really authentic, not the red coloured stuff most of the places sell)Mutton KeemaKaali DaalPulav ( Deceptively simple but yummy)Jalebi, Lassi, Mango Lassi..excellent options to wrap up the mealPArathas, Chapattis, Naans are available by default.Lots of vegetarian options eg the alu gobi and Stuffed Karela deserve a special mentionGo there of you want to taste the real taste of Punjab.I dont think any restaurant in SG serves Punjabi delicacies as Jaggis does.
4
Came here for dinner this week with a few friends. Good selection of curries and standard north Indian food. A bit of a pain to order as you have to go to the counter and pay first, but the food quality justifies the hassle. Beers are available too. Note that the location is now in Chander Rd
5
Very cheap prices and served buffet style like a canteen. You get a thali (tray with sectioned compartments) and then find a seat. Quick service. The food was delicious and authentic. not in least updated for "western tastes". Best indian curry we had during our whole trip. By the way he's moved just round the corner so this address is wrong. There's a note on the old premises telling you
4
After hearing so many rave reviews about the place, one fine day we decided to try Indian food here. I am a big time goodie and the choice of food and the dhabha concept was an instant hit with me. However, there was no cost indicated anywhere and the taste of food could have been better. Value for money. Good North Indian food option in Singapore.
5
The food is very reasonably priced and the portions are for one person so you can have a lot of choices. The Saag Chicken or Chicken Curry is especially very good. My wife loves the Dahi Wada here. They also serve hot chapathis which is a welcome change over Naans and Tandoor Rotis. However the location has changed, it is near the North Indian Temple on Chander road now
4
Been coming to Jaggi's for 7-8 years. They've moved to a new location -- nicer, brighter and more comfortable. Food remains as yummy as ever. Various type of tandoori meat available. Also available, various type of curry. I love the nan they make. Cheese nan is my favourite but that's individual preference. Service is nice but without smile. Great for all sorts of casual occasions. Mid-range Indian dining
3
Average north indian food at average prices. A no frills cafe in little india. You generally pick from the range of pre-prepared food. You can order naans, chapatis, rotis or rice to go with your meal. I personally go for the breads as I find the rice doesn't quite have any taste to it. The curries are generally fin
5
the food is just great here, They are always able to provide the same great taste everytime I order from them . The people who serve are also very nice and the new place is really better than the previous place.
3
I would say that there are plenty to choose from, but when it comes to neatness this really was a good positive point for this restaurant
5
Jaggi's restaurant is our typical Indian type outlet to enjoy delicious great food in really affordable prices. Its a self service center and you can choose any number of curries n kebabs from the display area ( you get to see what you are going to order) and add it to your palate. Charges will be as per the number of items added. Go for chicken and mutton kebabs and curries as I find them delicious. The portions will be smaller than other restaurants but you can take more of same curry or just try more variety. It will still be cheaper on your wallet
5
I had the pleasure of eating at the renovated Jaggi's earlier this week, courtesy of a long-time family friend. We stopped by at around 2 in the afternoon, and Jag Jr., the second-generation proprietor made us very comfortable in their wonderfully bright new setting.Jaggi's cooks all their food fresh daily, retaining nothing at the end of service. This alone would be a distinctive feature in the corner-cutting business that Singaporean restauranteering has become, but twinned with the excellence of the flavours on the menu, it is simply an unbeatable combination.As we were pressed for time I did not manage as broad a sampling of their fare as I would have preferred, but I am able to strongly recommend the following:-The BUTTER CHICKEN is seasoned perfectly and cooked with a very deft hand. The gravy for this dish was smooth, aromatic, flavourful and addictive. We were both induced to order additional chapati to mop up the remainder once we had disposed of the succulent and tender chicken.-Speaking of the CHAPATI, it was warm, soft and immaculate in texture, neither cracking into flakes nor flopping like a wet sponge when handled as I have too sadly experienced at inferior venues. As attested to in the title of this review, this is simply the finest chapati that I, a native son of Singapore have ever eaten in the country.-I had the NAAN, fluffy, piping hot and delicious, fresh off the real tandoor that they have on the premises.-The LAMB KEBAB is intriguingly spiced. Jag could not be induced to give up its secrets, but I found it a very appetizing accompaniment to the milder taste of the butter chicken-The ALOO GOBI was actually the hottest (spiciest if you must) dish we had, but it too was by no means overpowering or simply idiosyncratic the way you see buffalo wing restaurants throw in the chilli. The texture of the cauliflower too was just right, neither too hard from undercooking nor too damp from overcooking. I really enjoyed this and wished we'd had an even larger serving!-The YOGHURT was fresh and creamy, with just the right hint of sourness to go along with the sweetness of the dairy.-The ACHAR was pickled just a little less than I would have liked, but as that is strictly a matter of personal taste I deduct no marks for it.We ended our meal with MASALA CHAI, and it was sweetened absolutely correctly.I regret we were unable to squeeze in an order of the TANDOORI, but I will save that experience for a future visit.Finally, I should note that our entire sizable repast made hardly a dent at all on our pocketbooks. The whole meal with 2 mains, sides, multiple naan and chapati and tea came out to around $25, something anyone would be hard-pressed to do in the Most Expensive City in the World
4
Cafeteria-style northern Indian food. Breads (naan and roti) are made fresh. Other things get reheated, but are still tasty. Relaxed and clean atmosphere. Nice for a cheap family meal - we had 4 people and the bill was S$50. You can definitely find cheaper in little indian, but probably not as fresh and good
5
Jaggi's has a new temporary location but the food is the same. If any place come closer to what you get in the dhaba in India. Portions are good for two and are very reasonably priced. What you should eat recommend to pick what you see and feel like as it will be good. We prefer the "kadi" and Rice, mutton or chicken curry with Chapatti or the stuffed capsicum. Kids love the butter chicken with Naan. Yes make sure you try the samosa. Highly recommended!
4
Found this gem as i waswalking between closed restaurants mid afternoon. They had a great selection of tasty and authentic indian food. I went with the vegetarian option. Spices were nicely balanced butit very much reminded me of northern indian food. Great price for the food and you can choose what you want.
4
We were regular visitors to Jaggi's when our kids were growing up, went back today after several years. It's still good value for money. The main outlet on Racecourse Road is under renovation, so it is temporarily operating from a storefront on Chander Road,parallel road just behind, a couple of minutes walk. Jaggi's also has outlets in the downtown area at Shenton Court and AXA Tower.It remains a self-service cafe,where you choose your curries and dhals from the service counter, order your naans/parathas/rice options and make payment. As vegetarians, we had a satisfying meal for less than $20 for 2 persons.I am not a gourmet but I was quite satisfied with the quality, the rotis could have been slimmer though
4
Hi,I have been to this restaurant several times as its close to my office.Food served here is very delicious especially their naan and aloo paratha.Price is bit on higher end but can be tried whenever you are bored with foodcourts.Regards,Prakash Matuwan
4
First of all, Let me confess my bias. Being a regular inhabitant in Singapore as a working Foreign National, I was quite used to Jaggi's Food, whether it was having the tiffin @ Work or visitng in Little India or on Race Course Road restaurants. Nice ambience, finger licking North Indian (Veg & Non-Veg) delicacies don't let u feel that you're away from India. Their Sweet Lassi is a treat for heavens. Don't miss it, if u are in Singapore and love your thalis as much as I do :)
3
Food is aunthentic and great tasting but what a rip off . I paid less eating at much more well known restaurants nearby . Not worth paying $75 for take away veg food !
4
Went to their Little India outlet. This place has a lot of variety in north indian food. Since all the food is already made there is not much waiting time and service is very quick. Loved the tandoori chicken and mutton kebab.
5
Tried North Indian food. Simple home made food. The is tasty and value for money. Try their famous "Kadhi". Must try.
3
Went to Jaggi's recently. Apart from having to Que and self serve, the overall experience was average in food taste & quality. Ambiance was not great but adequate, almost "kopitiam like" Will certainly visit again for simple, no flair meals.
4
When you visit Jaggi's the first thing that hits you is the aroma of Punjabi food.Whether it's Veg or Non Veg options of Indian (especially Punjabi) cuisine, you won't be disappointed with the fare. The only thing that could be improved is their management of the people coming in during peak hours.Go for Jaggi's, a sumptuous Punjabi meal awaits you
5
I had visited Jaggi's 15yrs back on my 1st trip to Singapore in childhood. I still remember the yummy food. So this time when i planned a trip to Singapore, one of the 1st things in my to do list was visit to Jaggi's. I went there last week alongwith my husband. And i must say now its not only me but , my husband too is a fan of Jaggi's. The food and taste is just the same...luv luv luv their butter chicken :) ...In our 9 day trip, we took MRT on last day too just to have tht one meal at Jaggi's before we leave for Mumbai..Kudos to u all...Hope when i come back after few years again, i get the same taste ..
4
More like a cafe than a restaurant. Pre cooked buffet style. The food was tasty and portions reasonable. We had Butter chicken, chicken curry, chicken tikka, rice and naan for less than $30. I had been holding out for some Indian food and as soon as we opened the door of Jaggi's I knew I would get the tastes I was looking for! We would have visited again except for the fact we found it incredibly difficult to get a taxi back to our hotel from this area
2
Visited Jaggis AXA Tower for lunch, first time today 22 April. Ordered small with clear intention to get more if liked the food. Must say the paneer palak was really bad, flat taste with no flavour, tiny size of portion for six dollars. All in all, an absolute rip-off for $9.10, very poor value for money. You can get a much better meal for that. I am not going back there nor will I encourage you
5
Tried the north indian food here which was value for money. I tried aloo gobi and palak paneer while my wife tried mutton curry. The naan and the rotis were fabulous Note that this restaurant is temporarily shifted to chander road, just behind the original location at race course road
3
We have visited this place with family numerous time on race course road. These guys also used to have a food staff in Changi Business Park which later closed (reason unknown) The current race course road service simple average food. Budget restaurant. IF you want not much oily and ghee and simple food - Jaggi's is the place. It serves non veg as well on the same counter, so for few veg people this might be detrimental factor to consider
5
Best North Indian food I have tried in Singapore. The food is very reasonable for the great quality of food. A good selection of vegetarian options available.
4
Simple and delightful cuisine. I love the chapatis and romani roti. The tandoori is flavourful and succulent. Good value.
5
Very tasty Indian food.Queue up,point to your choices and off you go.Tandoori chicken and fish extremely yummy.Mutton curry very good.Cheap Kingfisher beer too.A great lunchtime experience.
4
It is one of the best North Indian Cuisin I have experienced a long time after St. Gregory's Place Singh's cooking which is now gone forever. THe restaurant is simple but the food is great.
5
On a day when u r missing home food, or when u simply want to hog on Punjabi (North indian) cuisine, Jaggi's is your best bet! Pick from a range of non vegetarian and/or vegetarian main course which is served in small (for 1 person) or large (for 2~3) portions. There are a few appetizers and sweetmeats too.Not for those who want a chic, quiet ambience!This place is noisy and messy (but not unhygienic) because the food at the counter looks scrumptious and people cant wait to get started.Pros:Quality of foodConsistency in tasteServing sizeKingfisher lagerVariety of foodCons:High turmeric content :DThis was my Fourth visit!
4
Very close to little India. This place serves authentic punjabi stuff. Best part is it is tasty and the dishes are reasonably priced in singapore.The staff is courteous and served us well till we finished late at night.Carving for Indian beer. Place to visit :
4
When you want to have a wholesome meal, tasty home like food, come to jaggis. love to concept of small portions and more variety. Not oily, lots of options both for Veg and Non-Veg. The place was full when we went for our dinner at 8pm
3
We went in today for early dinner. We ordered ;- Chicken Tikka which very nice. Full of aroma and very tasty. - Mutton Briyani which mutton was very well marinade and tender. Rice was full of flavor and fluffy. - Mutton Kebabs was quite good. - Palak Paneer doesn't hv much cheese in it. Spinach sauce was little bland. - Plain Naan was quite good. Fluffy, soft and done right. The price was cheap, all of those dishes only 26.80$Theâ€‹ ambiance is just like a school cafeteria. The ordering process wasn't well organized.
4
- Try the Stuffed Kulchas (Only on weekends), Samosas, Baingan Bharta (Eggplant), Pakoda Kadhi, Pulav, Chole (Chickpeas).- Not so great: Can skip the paneer dishes, sweets, lassis.- Warning: This is a very simple ambience, simple cutlery, self service eatery.- Slightly overpriced for the ambience and quantity but the taste is pretty consistent and fantastic. Seller's market :-)Tip: Order the Breads first, wait for it to be ready and then only order the curries. Else you will be left looking at the curries going cold, while waiting for the bread to turn up
5
As I Belongs from North India ! My First Choice was this restaurant ! And It was as amazing as i thought !! As Punjabi food is delicious, This make it even more Great. Finger licking Stuff, Delivery on time, Fast and Good Services, 100% Hygiene !
4
Its a famous, hence busy place frequented by people of all nationalities.
Best - Roti, Naan, palak-paneer and all chicken afgaani
Not so good - Their self service system is not exactly organized.
4
We stopped here for dinner with 2 families and a lot of kids. The food is absolutely great. We tried lots of different dishes. I definitely recommend it if you like Indian food!
5
We had a wonderful meal here recently..... nothing fancy just genuine cooking and well frequented by the locals. Amazing food, freshly prepared and inexpensive. Highly recommend a visit.
3
Does not delivers food.
I asked for delivery to my hotel bit they politely refused.
Food is ok otherwise.
4
If you want great Indian food at reasonable prices this is the spot. They won't win any awards for ambience or comfort but the food is good and reliable... good every time.
4
We had the Achari kababs, yellow daal, naan (amazingly soft) , Paneer butter masala and some really awesome Gulaab Jamuns ! Food for 3 costed us only 40 SGD for all the above and eaten heartily. Most importantly the taste reminded us of food back home in India which we crave as NRIs. Definitely going there again 
5
Craving for authentic punjabi khana (food)?+food that tastes like home cooked fare?+food that is cheap on the wallet?+fast service?+ok with not so great ambiance?If you said Yes to all the above, then you should be heading straight to Jaggi's!!Jaggi's works like a typical self service over-the-counter fast food place - they have a set menu of pre-cooked items that you can choose from. You can rest assured that the food is fresh and real tasty. It's all self-service - you order, pay, pick up food and feast on! And the place is a steal for the quality they offer. The only turn off is the ambiance and probably the only reason why I do not frequent this place enough. But, that does not take anything away from the quality and value of food served by Jaggi's
4
You can see and choose the food in this self service resturant...the dal is absolutely home cooked taste. The mutton is very good. The rotis are fresh and crispy. But for a little run down resturant , the prices are steep. But the taste of the food overrules the short comings
3
I had been here on three occasions. Based on that I can say that the place is surely value for money. You can keep ordering and everytime you would be amazed at the total bill.The setup is basic with simple ambiance, no frills. Plain Table, Chairs, few for larger groups. You need to order looking at displayed food. Options are plenty. Taste of curries is average. It is not bad, but is less in spicy level. It is more like a home made food. Best part is fresh crispy Tandoori Rotis stacked and served at table. Generally it gets full during lunch/ dinner. Restaurant means pure business at lowest possible price yet try to provide good food.For those Tandoori rotis and value for money, I can revisit it till I get bored
5
Wow - this place is the perfect place to go when one has a longing for true North Indian/Punjabi food. Authentic and delicious - TOO good! Also not overloaded in oil so the food doesn't feel unhealthy. We had channa, paneer, naan, etc - all were excellent. Ambience is basic, but the food more than makes up for this - enjoy
5
Jaggi's North Indian restaurant serves authentic north Indian and non veg food..vegetarian food is more like 'ghar ka khana' ( home made food). The serving size is not enough in accordance to the price. Seekh kebab and chicken tandoori is worth a try.
3
This is again one of the places which I heard that its really good but when I explored ... I found it just average ... Nothing great about this place

What you see is what you get - tasty north indian food, all appetisingly displayed at the counter. Been a few times and haven't been disappointed. Service is quick.
4
Got a delicious selection of food, all recommended by the owner. Great value for money! Highly recommend the tandoori chicken. Don't be put off by the very simple interior - the food is worth it!

This is a very solid and recommendable cooking shop for a relaxed lunch. Not a restaurant for SIngaporian banking business. You select for the buffet counter, sweet or hot, chicken or beef or veg, Nan bread is served fresh even according special requests (I love coriander and a trace of garlic).The restaurant is ideal to pass with the family and let the kids have a good time. We spent a couple of hours for lunch and enjoyed the plates of chicken masala and sweet cauliflower. ood value for money and moderate prices for Singapore
5
In 15 years, neither the menu nor the quality has changed.The food is good, and fast (you pint and order the dishes, naans and rotis arrive a few minutes later). Ambience is basic, but the service is excellent.Although catering mostly to North Indians in Singapore, about a third of the customers are local non-Indians
5
Jaggi's not a fine dining place. Neither is it it great for couples to hold hands and have great indian food. Its not great for kids to play around. Its crowded. The ordering process is chaotic at best. Dont expect to walk in on a weekend evening and get a table right away.But I dont care. The food is yummmmm. mmmmmmm..mmmmmmmmmmm..mmmmIt feels fresh, healthy, homely (only if you have gifted cooks at home), and did I mention yummmmmmmmm.....mmmmmmm....mmmm
5
It's a great place located very close to Little India MRT (Exit E). Unlike the other Indian restaurants found on the parallel road, this place has a quite ambiance, awesome home-like food away from home :-)Must go. I have had so many meals here. Value for money. Very fulfilling :D Thank you Jaggi's

My brief to my (south) Indian colleague was to take me to a hole in the wall Indian restaurant serving authentic north Indian cuisine. This is where he took me. Was kind of surprised when i walked in, since all the food was pre-cooked (like in a cafeteria). Surprisingly the food was all nice and hot and not dry (especially the tandoori dishes), probably because of the fast turnover and their cooking technique (slightly undercooked perhaps)?The tandoori dishes were excellent and apart form the usual chicken, lamb and beef, they also had fish, which was new to me. The curries were however not exactly to my liking (perhaps I'm more used to a thicker and heavier style that I had before in the UK and Hong Kong). Beer was nice and cold and helped to wash down what was a good dinner
4
When you want a fuss-free, quick and good quality lunch, Juggi's is the place to head to. They have a limited menu, all on display under a glass counter. Chapatis and naans are freshly made to order. I must have been there at least a 100 times in the last 5 years. It's true that the staff doesn't bend over backwards to please you, but once you get to know them, they're friendly enough
4
Tasty north indian punjabi food like kadi pakoda chole daal makni. ..With garlic naan aloo kulcha. .We ordered chaas also. .It was good. .highly recommend
4
Value for money resturant. But they really need to know what is real dal makhani.
Self service good location but need to advertise more so that people can find then easliy
5
Great kulchas and kababs coupled with good quality dal and other breads. Service is efficient and friendly and prices are very reasonable. A must visit if you are near Little India.
4
Was in the area for a meeting and decided to return to this restaurant (was here with a friend several months ago). Not the cheapest meal but the quality of food is fantastic. The tandoori chicken was succulent and the spinach with cheese was tasty. It is like cafeteria type setup - you order and pay for it before getting seats on rows of tables. Would have give a full five star if the service staff was friendlier or smile a little. The cost of meal is probably between S$12 - S$18 per person.
5
Located on Race course road in Little India , this place is a gem. Best vegetarian food i had in SGP. One small bowl of Dal & Paneer cost S$ 3.5 each. One Tawa Roti is S$ 3. and the taste is like you are eating in a dhaba in Delhi.My parents are old and vegetarians , so finding food for them while in SGP was a task. But Jaggis food made them feel like they are eating something familiar.I tried Copper Chimney which was 500m from this resturant . The price was nearly double.If you are craving for good punjabi food while in SGP , this is the best place. Very near to Little India MRT station
4
This place is on Race Course Rd, in Little India area. From one of my Singapore acquaintance, I heard that this was one famous outlet for Indian food, which resulted in my visit. I went for a dinner, there was ample crowd but I found an empty table. The idea is to select what vegetables and other items you want from a counter, and pay there itself. The serve will bring in breads if you have ordered. Apart from this, it is a self service restaurant. The food was nice, some items were really good, i.e. baingan bharta and dal. Breads were ok, I also ordered laccha paratha but it was not of standards of what we get in India. I did not try non-veg but I believe it would be nice as it seems that the restaurant is famous for non-veg items. Prices were reasonable. Sweet items were not that good, they serve cold jalebis and i am not used to that as we get hot jalebis in India
4
The ambience of the place is very unassuming and simplistic. But the food is definitely authentic in taste. The mutton curry was just right and so was the dal. Even the tandoori roti was nice and crisp (on demand). I'm told the menu changes everyday but today's preperations were well made. The place to visit if you are looking for good no frills North Indian food in Singapore
3
It's a place which provides you with comfort food away from home. But don't expect any service. You need to fetch your own food from the counter to the table. Also the choice available is only limited to what's already there for the day. So all in a all a place you want to go just for food..
4
I have to say the kebabs here are outstanding, definitely worth a trip just for that. The place is rather dinery, so I would recommend take out or delivery from there, and going elsewhere to eat. It's self service as well, where you pay at the front and someone comes and gives you the food
4
Come here for a down-to-ear experience of North Indian food. Not all items are equally flavoured, and certain menu items and spice level varies throughout the week. Daal makhani, lady fingers and chickpeas are recommended for vegg - the lamb minced meat is also not bad. Overall not cheap given the very basic setting, but authentic and well spiced
4
Authentic Indian home cooking! Another favorite of mine. Food already prepared and very tasty. The only thing I dislike is that they microwave the food.
4
Truly authentic Punjabi food. Tried roti, Curry and Chicken Biriyani. Items were servers hot and were very fresh.
Truly a complete North Indian experience. Good pricing adds to the value.
Restaurant needs to improve the ambience.
4
Came here with an Indian colleague and had one of my greatest Indian meals since here. Here are only Indians eating, which I consider as a very good sign. I had a multitude of little plates and it was all very tasty. Loved the experience!!
4
Love the aloo naan here. Simple yet authentic punjabi food. Reasonably priced and gives a feeling of home made food..
5
Absolutely love this place! Good value for money Indian food, conveniently located, homely feeling with the utensils and quite friendly staff. One of my most frequented places in Singapore!
4
I had been there 5 times during last one year, food taste is still great. Apart from that the Owner & his wife are very friendly & would be pleased to fulfill your extra requirementsMust Try items:a. Chole with Parathab. Aloo Gobhi with chapatic. DalNon Veg Items are also very goo
4
This was a really delicious meal and so worth the walk when we got off the bus at the wrong stop! Make sure you get off at Little India MTR station! Delicious paneer, nan bread and chicken dish and very pleasant service. Very worth a visit when in Singapore
4
Basic setting, but very well balanced food fit for a truly North Indian taste.Kadhi, Rajma, authentic chicken curry, even a god variety of kababs, dal, rice...every single item has the taste of a Punjabi dhabi written all over it. Even the sweets are good! And light on the budget. I have already visited this place thrice in a month and Bill ranges from 10-17 Singapore dollars per pax depending on how elaborate you want your meal to be!Must try their kadhi, chicken curry and paneer. Super recommended
4
Been here 3 times whilst in Singapore. Fantastic food at very reasonable prices. Best chicken tikka I've ever tasted! The restaurant itself is quite basic and don't expect waiter service, but if good food is top of your list, then this place is well worth a visit. Probably best to avoid Sundays when the locals take over Little Indi
4
A friend of mine introduced me to this place some time back, and I have returned a few times since then to eat at the place. The place serves nice northen Indian cuisine at a reasonable price. The owners are quite friendly, and the place conveniently located within a short walking distance from the MRT station. Will certainly be back for more indian food if I happen to be around the area
5
It was the most of time when in Singapore that I ate here. there are some amazing kulchas available with mouth watering dahi pakora. also the stuffed karela is a must try!! with a very reasonable price, the food served is amazingly authentic!
5
Place to go if you are craving for some nice home cooked north-indian food. Specialties to note Karhi Pakora, Mutton Masala and Paneer. Good tandoori and kebabs too.
People are really good!

Amongst the many Indian restaurants in Little India, the one I always go to is this restaurant that’s located at Race Course Road. I had a craving for North Indian food this week and proposed to my lunch group and they agreed. I brought them here. Here are the meal highlights:- Tandoori Chicken (Yoghurt): Marinated in yoghurt and cooked in tandoor oven. It was juicy and tasty. Delicious. - Tandoori Chicken: marinated in spices and cooked in the tandoor oven. It has a nice smokey flavor and was nice! - Lamb Kebab: Colored a deep red, which we think is due to the spice coloring. It is minced lamb and no strong lamb taste. Preferred the chicken to this. - Basmati Rice: The rice is cooked with fennel and herbs. Frangrant and easy to eat. It has the texture of ‘butter rice’. It goes well with the butter chicken and palak paneer. - Butter Chicken: This is one of the signature dish for the restaurant. It is not spicy and goes well with the basmati rice or roti. Good taste.- Palak Paneer: Cheese cubes cooked in puree spinach. Healthy and nice. - Cauliflower: This was cooked with Indian spices and was dry. Absolutely yummy. My lunch partners loved it. - Vadai with Yoghurt topped with Saffron Powder: This is the vegetarian vadai (without prawn) that has been deep fried and then laden with yoghurt and topped with saffron powder. I tried it for the first time. I usually don’t like the vegetarian vadai. But after eating this, I am a convert. The yoghurt added a nice creamy texture to the dish and it was yummy. Try it!- Roti: Simple flat brown bread that’s cooked over a flat plan without oil. Healthier than the traditional prata. Wouldn’t feel guilty eating this compared to eating prata. Also made fresh. Nice!- Naan: We ordered the garlic and plain naans. Made fresh to order and best eaten hot!I spotted the Gulab Jamon and would have ordered it if I wasn’t full. The next time!We ended our meal with a masala tea, which was the perfect end to a good meal. The restaurant was close to full, with many guests taking taxis to and from the restaurant. This shows its popularity amongst its customers who are prepared to travel to eat.Recommended

I am Punjabi and visited jaggis today as we haven't had proper Indian since we left for our trip. We walked in and were greeted very nicely by the staff. There is no menu, just look through the counter and pick. All perfectly made as if made by your nan (saag paneer) or dad (lamb curry!), with rotis and traditional mint chutney. Best place in Singapore for authentic Punjabi food
5
I wont shy away in calling this as best North Indian restaurant in Little India especially at a great price. We found this place by luck and soon and ended up eating almost everyday during our trip. The food is apt with less oil and spices, yet great Indian taste. Prices are kept reasonable. Neat place. Overall a great place
5
We found this hotel as a recommendation in Lonely Planet and were not disappointed at all. I was there for an official trip and used to have my dinner there. It offered a daily menu based service and was extremely satisfied with it. I strongly suggest to any Indian visitor and staying in Little India
5
I went here as a guest of a North Indian ex-pat living in Singapore because it's his favorite place in Little India and was very impressed with the food. Sure, you have to go to the counter and order for yourself, but that's the way things work at many places in Little India. Naturally, my host did all of the ordering, so we could do all of the eating and drinking. We had Tiger and Kingfisher beer at reasonable prices and the garlic naan was superb. For non-vegetarian, probably the best I've had in Little India
5
Brilliant. The eggplant was to die for, lamb curry melt in your mouth, the variety and delicacy of flavours makes this a fabulous find. We had entrees and a main, and drinks for <40S$. Always a good sign to see the locals eating there. Friendly, polite service
4
We stopped in because a friend had worked here years ago and stayed for a meal because everything looked so good. We were not disappointed.Although this is a very "standard" eatery, with no attention to decor or other niceties, the food was excellent. Diners chose their dishes from a display counter and are served immediately. Naan is prepared fresh (somewhat small, but very good nonetheless). Tandoori items are re-heated and deboned. We tried the mint tandoori--very good!We were extremely happy to have found this place and definitely recommend it
5
We entered the restaurent because it displayed "North Indian Food" in big letters. Ambiance was a turn-off and very basic. Added to that its a self service. To go to the counter, select the dishes from display, pay for it and thats it. Only tandoori rotis are served fresh. Food is served on 1970s steel plates. But once we ordered the food, it was the best ever tasted in India or abroad. Its a no nonsense, absolutely home cooked, and mouth watering food. Its a must for any person visiting from India. Even after 24 hrs, i have an urge to go back again. Yummy. Very much recommended.
3
Good food, clean atmosphere, pleasant staff and free water. Part of a whole street of good looking restaurants
4
Food is good for a quick meal with a variety of north indian spread. The quantity is very poor for the price . Self Service. Overall a reasonable place to eat.
4
This is a family run place with good food. Authentic Punjabi food. Great Rotis and a range of dishes to choose from. It's basic though. Nothing fancy in terms of the environment. But the food is good - it's clean and bright.
1
Once I had bitter gourd n vomited badly at night.... Next I found raw chicken in chicken tikka so I would never visit to this restaurant again :/
4
What else do you need when you get so yummy Indian food when you are out of your country.We were searching for good Indian restaurants on race course road , in fact we tried few restaurants but none of them was as delicious as this one. Simply delicious punjabi food and budget friendly
4
This is a cheap and basic restaurant. The food is displayed in a cabinet though the breads are made freshAll the food I tried, a kebab starter, chicken and pilau rice, were well spiced and interesting to eat.The naan was fresh and lovelyWashed down with Tiger beer this was a great experienceHad an ongoing conversation with the owner - so a friendly place.Be aware this is a simple place where you go for the food and not for the decor
5
Few Indians visiting or living in Singapore are unaware of Jaggi's. located on the busy Race Course Road in Little India, though is theoretically competes with at least 25 other Indian restaurants within 500 meters, Jaggis has a unique spot and value. Reasonably priced food, excellent Punjabi taste and a no-nonsense attitude makes it one of my absolute WW favorite indian eaterie
4
What are you looking for?If it is good Punjabi food... Youareattherightplace.Do you want a good meal sans frills, dhaba (street style ) + aircon+ beer , hygiene, you aretheright placeAre you looking for a fancy meal for2 with service,menu,smiles... Wrong place.Go to dhabasin India, this ishow food islikelyto beserved....they just dish out freshly prepared food,no msg blah blah....you pay for the food... The kitchen team / owner philosophy make the difference.Conclusion: good value for money, tasty basic spread of dishes, rotis, parathas, veggies, meat based dishes, biriyani ...As far as i know it, this is the place in singapore for true blue punjabi food. We are there often for our concept of a fine meal.. All else pales in comparison.... Be it rangmahal, vansh, Tandoor... And the other little india north indian joints... Thisi is unvarnished food to me.....the closest north indian fare came from a cafe called namaste india that shut down recenty....Enjoy yourself and use your fingers as we do..
4
Went with my girl for "Punjabi breakfast"Excellent quality of food, very fresh ingredients.The interior is very basic, but this place caters for the locals and they seem to love it, it was really packed on a sunday morning.Very friendly owners and the price tag is very low.Highly recommended for any fans of north indian fare in a basic settin
4
Found it at the end of my trip .People who love north indian food should try it .Food is not expensive comparatively( S$ > Roti-1.5 , Pulao- 2.5 ,Chhole -4.4 ) . This is located in the basement food court of AXA Tower.- opposite to International Plaza . Its open from 11am - 2.30 pm.
5
Wonderful North Indian curries, the saag paneer and butter chicken were especially nice. The various tandoori chickens were the softest juiciest I have ever had. The decor is decidedly canteen-style, but for the great food and very reasonable prices it's definitely worth it!
4
Two chicken dish, 2 veggie dips and 3 naans for about $25. Tasty. Chicken meat is tender. We love it!
3
We looked up Jaggi's rated number 1 of Little India restaurants in a Singapore book written in 2009 and it was also on Trip Advisor, but ranked in the 300's out of 2,000 in Singapore. It was basically a cafeteria (with no ambiance) with pre-cooked food. Asking questions was not what the attendant was there for. The food was average still paying S$50 to fill up the family of four. We live in S. Korea and are now even more blessed to have great Indian food within walking distance. It wasn't worth the Taxi to and from Little India. There are hundereds of restaurants in Little India, I would try most of them first. Jaggi's wasn't bad, it just wasn't worth seeking out. Little India is a good sized neighborhood (two subway stops worth) reaping the sights, sounds and smells of India, it's worth a trip
5
D only place for authentic punjabi food.food that wl not let u feel away from home.One of the biggest concerns I had when I moved to Singapore is that I wasn't sure if I'll get any great vegetarian eating options here. The first North Indian restaurant we went to was Jaggis and the food was awesome! Much better than what I expected. Great value for money and proper Dhabha style eating

The Karela and the Kadhi Chawal are a must try! Highly recommended for a quick, value for money and delicious meal!
4
If you crave for good North Indian food (veg and non veg) go to Jaggis. It's has good butter chicken, kebabs, dal and chapatis. The kadhi rice is simply divine. They are short on desert choices, but overall I would rate them one of the best in Singapore.Fairly reasonable pricing. About sgd 10 if you take kebabs, chapatis and one chicken dish
4
It's a very good place who love to have North Indian food. It is also very near to little India MRT station. Food tastes really good, no oily and the prices are reasonable. It's a self service with a well maintained cleanliness and sufficient number of seating. You can taste a variety of chicken flavors in a tandoori style. You won't be disappointed for going there
4
We packed our dinner here. Food is typical Punjabi, may taste spicy to some. Location is good @ Little India, Dine-in also seemed fairly ok , Prices are very reasonable, Servings are generous. 75 SGD for 4 dishes, tandoori chapati, dahi vadas, veg biryani, rasgulla , suitable for 9 pax is very very reasonable in a far away land where Indian food is quite expensive otherwise !
4
A good place to grab a quick indian food.We have been there 3-4 times now and haven't found anything to complain about.I was not too impressed with the ambience at first - but the food and decent prices did make up for it. I do like the concept of small portion sizes so that even a couple can try 2-3 dishes at one meal.We did try a couple of other restaurants on the same street but were disappointed - somehow we always come back to Jaggis
5
first got to know abt Jaggi's when i was working near Singapore Expo. there will always be a long queue in the food court and many indians (locals and foreigners alike) will be in the queue.this shows the food is of a certain standard and boy, it sure is good!i'm a regular customer at the race course road "restaurant". it's not really a restaurant, more like mini food court where you'll have to self service.What's good? The palak paneer, chicken tikka, cheese naan, minced mutton curry, butter chicken. etcWhat's not so good? nothing actually but not a fan of indian sweets. =
4
The 2 branches I have been to offer good, hearty punjabi Dhaba food thankfully somewhat less greasy and spicy than what the food served in this category is..overall quite good
5
Food is simple and delicious and very very homely at cost of 10$ a meal. Specially "Palak Paneer" and "aloo Gobhi" are very delicious. I have visited this restra almost 20 times and would go again.
3
Bit Over rated restaurant, . We tried Butter Chicken(Taste: Too Salty) , Paneer makhani(Taste: Avg) with roti. Taste is avg, Dont go with too much expectation by reading reviews here.
5
We loved the food, ate there twice during our trip to Singapore. It is a hole in the wall, but the food is great!
4
Lowdown first: If you expect to come to "classic" restaurant, you will be disappointed. It looks like a canteen, there is self-service and there is neither a menu nor any price signage at the desk where food is sold. But isn't it nice to have a conversation with your host and asking about name and content instead of just pointing on a menu sheet or a container? It has been remarked that portions are rather small here, but they are great if you want to try different things in the course of one meal. And it's NOT expensive. It's just more expensive than Chinese food, especially at Hawker Centres. So, if you like to customize your meal and if you are into enticing texture and complex flavour, THIS is the place to go if you feel like having a North Indian meal.I cannot remember having better meat dishes in a Indian restaurant. The Chicken Tikka (3,30 SGD half-portion, 6,50 SGD regular) is just breathtaking in both seasoning and texture, and both the Saag Gosh (lamb curry 5,50 SGD) and the Butter Chicken (7,20 SGD) have creamy gravies to-die-for. Both the Cheese nan (3,50 SGD) and the Chapatti (1 SGD) are excellent sides, I also liked the Pulau rice (2,50 SG full portion). Palak Paneer (3 SGD) is OK, whereas the Kala Jamun and even more the Gulab Jamun (1,50 SGD/1,20 SGD per piece) were again fully convincing. Regarding the quality of the food, I can easily accept the above-mentioned flaws on the atmosphere and transparency side. Highly recommended!Opening hours: Mon-Thu 11.30a.m.to 3 p.m., 5.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.Fr 11.30 a.m. to 3 p.m., 5.30 p.m. to 10.45 p.m.Sat,Sun,Public Holidays 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., 5.30 p.m. to 10.45 p.m
4
The food is really tasty.Specially Dal makhni and Dahi bhalla. Other than Palak paneer and Paneer butter masala the food is really good.Really well priced.We ate there for three times during our visit to singapore. Tried almost every vegetarian dish and few desserts also.Service was not that good but not bad either.i would visit Jaggis whenever I go to Singapore
2
I can't comment on this restaurant's "authenticity," but the food was cold and far overpriced. The entrees are set up in buffet style, but everything is priced a-la-carte. For two people, we spent just over S$50, including enough food and drinks for both of us (2 beers, 1 mango lassi). The naan was fine, since that was cooked to order, but the rest of the meal was served at room temperature or only slightly above. Everything tasted alright, but none of the dishes were any better than what we'd expect from a mediocre Indian lunch buffet spread in the US, where the food is considerably warmer and costs half as much as we spent here
1
After our e mail exchanges with Jaggis at race course road , we went to Jaggis to confirm the order and pay the advance for our catering . As agreed upon in the mail we placed him an order of 100 pax . To our surprise , this staff person looked at the menu and said how can I give you this menu at this price ( which clearly he agreed upon in his mail ) . When we showed him the mail , his reply was " I didn't read it carefully " . Instead of apologizing and accommodating anything his uncouth reply was " its not my mistake " .. " I can't talk anymore as I have to attend other customers " . Where can we get such hospitality .. I must say Jaggis have no respect for their word and no decency whatsoever !
5
This little restaurant on Racecourse road is plain and simple in appearance - do not be fooled. The food is very good and well priced. Great selection of both meat and vegetarian food. Licensed for beer. It is near the extremely over-rated Banana Leaf Apolo - keep walking past the Banana Leaf as you will be disappointed
5
Jaggis is one of favourite place for fresh, tasty and reasonably priced veg food (they have non veg options too). Their rotis and nanns are always freshly made and taste great! I love their samosa and masala tea! Just wish they have more veg options! I also love the serving size/portion, which is just enough for you to try everything (although I suspect some may think it is too small). Their set up and deco is really simple but clean, so do not expect it to be fancy like the others along the same street. But food wise, the get 5 thumbs up
4
The naans and curries are yum
4
Great north indian food
3
Great for takeaways!
5
great food no MSG and good prices.
4
one of my fav north indian restaurants... very affordable, compared to others along Race Course Road.
4
The row of Indian restaurants along Race Course Road is tricky . There are the stalwarts proferring the Singapore sizzler , fish head curry .Still an exotic but tasty dish to share with visitors .However, this is no longer an inexpensive meal , as downed with Tiger beer , which is not an optional but quite compulsory due to the spicy heat , per diner spend could be up to 50 dollars.The rest of the Johnny come latelys are what I would term mutton dressed up as lamb .Standard or substandard Indian food at what would be termed as Indian fine dining prices which is what the row of restaurants is considered to be , that is, the upmarket part of Little India to bring non Indians to partake of Indian fare .That is why Jaggi's is such a gem.Luscious buttery chicken, fresh warm Naans, flavorful curries redolent of punchy spices with vegetarian and non vegetarian options. And to end with teh tarik - milky sweet tea or tea halia- ginger tea to settle the stomach.The ambiance is what one makes if it - but the yummy food makes for good company and knowing thar there is no additives like MSG means no parching thirst .Self service but very helpful and big smiles alway

Have been to the Punjab in India several times (helps that my wifes family if from this great place in the World)We went here as it was recommended by a work colleague and this site gave it decent enough reviews. Its a fairly simple affair from the outside - basic seating and tables, very low budget affair the next level up from Hawker centre style. Its a cafe not a restaurantIts a buffet style but you choose from the counter. Food is very plain and unspicedWe decided to have starters - a Lamb kebab and a fish starter, with Yoghurt. We were so underwhelmed by the taste that we decided to leave after the starterThis is one of the first times I think we have ever walked out after the starter.. but its self service almost so easy to do this and wouldnt feel so bad as if this was a proper restaurant Cost for the 2 starters, yoghurt and a couple of cokes was approx 18 Sing Dollars as I recall so not that cheapWe wont be going back there. Our search for a decent non-Hawker style Indian food place continues
5
This restaurant has been serving excellent North Indian food for the last several years. You will get authentic homely Punjabi food which is not to oily, not too spicy, yet very tasty. The restaurant has simple interior, furniture and is reasonably priced but in terms of quality of the food, it beats many of the high end Indian restaurants in Singapore hands down! Not to be missed dishes - tandoori chicken, tikkas, sheek kabab, stuffed Karela, butter chicken, dal makhni, alu gobi....and genuinly Punjabi naans, rotis and parathas
5
The best north indian food that you can find anywhere on the planet (including India). Can you imagine finding perfectly done stuffed capsicum or Karela? This place does it! The fare is simple, wholesome and lip smacking good. You have to fight the crowd of local Singaporeans to get to your food! No frills, no nonsense, just great food at fantastic prices. The perfect remedy for homesick foodies
5
My wife and I and our daughter met a couple of friends for dinner. They had been here a few times before, but we never had been and they really liked it and we were not disappointed. The staff were very attentive to serving the customer and the food was nicely prepared and fresh. If you like Indian food, you can't go wrong here
3
cheap and good north indian food, parathas make all the diference
4
very homely food

fond memories of fluffy-crispy, warm garlic naan, tandoori & rich butter chicken. comparable with those i tasted in india!
4
Great food. A bit over-priced.

so-so. What's the hype about this place? Banana Leaf Apollo better.
