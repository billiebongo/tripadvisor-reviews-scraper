Located in the heart of little India. This is one of the gems I came across for sweets and savouries. Love their Rasgullas, Samosas and Kachoris. Love the authentic taste and so far the best I came across in Singapore

Friendly staff and a very good selection of Indian sweets; salty delicacies are also offered but I did not try them. I picked some Burfi and Ladoos; I enjoyed the fact that they were not overly sweet.

Not only is there a wide range of sweets, the Samosas are very good. Have one with the sauce. They are vegetarian and have no onion.

Our regular shop for Indian sweets. We always drop by for Samosa, Kachori, etc. Though it gets finished as soon a new batch of hot snacks arrive in the shop, so your timing needs to be right. Freshness and authentic Indian is guaranteed. On Sundays (holiday) you can find long queue infornt of shop to buy sweets, generally daily wage earners

Simple best in Singapore for North indian sweets and prices are very cheap. Best is Samosa, a must try. Not sure how they make but its the best I ever tasted. Almost always a long queue especially during festive season.Reasonably good verities of all common types of indian sweets.Located opposite Tekka mall at Little india arcade.Yumm

Was quite happy with this place. We got:Samosa - filling was pretty much how it is back home. Spicy and tangy in equal measure. Would highly recommend. Kachori - nice overall though the filling was slightly dry. Would recommend. Rasmalai - excellent. Nice, soft and airy with a light ras (would have been better if it was slightly thicker). A bit miserly on the garnish though (fewer pistachios and almonds). One of the best rasmalai in Singapore. Chamcham - awful. Hard sugar rectangle. No flavor other than overpowering sweetness. Definitely worth avoiding.

Moghul Sweet shop is located on the ground floor of Little India Arcade, a cluster of conserved shophouses on the corner of Campbell Lane and Serangoon road. We stopped here during a wslking tour of Little India, part of the Heritage Festival program. The newly opened Indian Heritage Centre is located just opposite, on Campbell Lane.There's a bewildering range of sweets for the uninitiated. After a while, I selected a ladoo being a sweet that I had heard of and quickly realised that these came in several flavors (sugee, coconut, peanut, to name a few). All rather tasty. Cost $1.50 a piece. A fun stop if you're in the neighbourhood.

Read other reviews and Moghul sweet shop was on our list. On a trip to Little India we pay a visit to Moghul and purchased some of the sweets recommended by other reviewers. They were not expensive only about $1-$2 SD apiece.We had them straight away and well they tasted ok, nothing of significance. May be we expected something else different but least it was a good experience. Then we went to the opposite side into the Tekka Centre to explore for a while before we had our lunch at Blue Diamond Restaurant
