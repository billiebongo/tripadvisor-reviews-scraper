Excellent food and friendly staff. Love their durian cake. Tried their lobster meal, though it take a while before it is being served, but it is definitely worth the wait and value for money too.
4
Food is good but slightly overpriced. Service is excellent! Desserts are good especially the durian cake. The ah gong ah ma noodles is a must order dish at Creatures!
4
We had the chocolate cake and the slice was huge (big enough for 3 to share even)! The caramel sauce, sea salt and scoop of coconut ice cream complemented the cake really well. I would come back again just for their cakes.
5
From the very first step into the restaurant, you are covered. With the good services, food, (food portions). No doubt the desserts, you should go for it!
5
Ambience was great, service was good. A bit on the pricey side but the food was not bad. Menu was creative.
4
we went in a grp of 5 and tried many dishes, the duck and pear dish and kueh pie tee ngoh hiang dishes were our top fav. the $30 hokkien mee was not bad just abit pricey. oh and the cakes were delicious, esp their famous durian cak
4
Came here on a Saturday night with a friend. Very cozy atmosphere with large serving of meal. We ordered the signature laksa and hokkien mee. Unfortunately we didn’t get to try the famous durian cake as it was already sold out by the time we order our dessert. Nevertheless, the dark chocolate more than made up for it! And the service here was impeccable.

My wife and i ate there on the recommondation of a local 'eat well' book and did not regret it. Excellent service and good food.My wife has roat duck and pear as a starter, and I joined in-it was good. My starter was the prawn spring rolls and thre you tiao rojak, which is a communal dish so my wife had half of it as her main course. The spring rolls were a bit soggy, but obverall very good tasts. As a main course I had *I will eat this spicy prawn past* and it was a goods idea to tell them not to m amke it too spicy beacuse then it was super. Smal wine list, but the bottle of McMankis pinot noir worked very well.Small restaurant with 25 seats downstair (don't know about upstairs) situated in Little India, which itself is worth a visi

Ordered the Teochew Clan Braised Duck rice roll and the Creatures Laksa, portion of food is sufficient for sharing of two person.Love the beautiful presentation of the rice roll, the duck meat was tender. Was disappointed with the laksa broth that had a weird burnt taste.Lovely decor and ambience of the cafe
5
Two of us had the lobster and cod for $40 each - these were the most expensive items on the menu though (everything else is about $24-34). Both were delicious: the lobster was really meaty and substantial, the flesh was tender, juicy and sweet. It went well with the ikura on vermicelli that came with some funky sour sauce. The cod was amazing so sweet and flavourful, and the rice balls that came with it were interesting too. we weren’t super full from both dishes so we also had the durian cake which was pleasant and surprisingly light even though the flavours were strong. Also, the place is really pretty.
4
my 1st visit a few weeks back, the food was hearty and the ambience was good. this time round, it was lunch, the food was still ok, but it lacks certain finesse. can do better like the kong bao pao. it tasted very ordinary
4
Nice place for gathering. Steep price but food was good. Great service and friendly and attentive staffs. One comments will be the washroom on the ground floor that needs improvement.

I visited Creatures for dinner with my friends. I would like to specially give praise to the Durian cake and the Laksa! The Laksa is one of the best I have eaten in Singapore, no regrets for ordering that. Do remember to mix the chilli paste for friends who would like it to be spicy. The durian cake is one of the best recommended dessert for Creatures. I ordered a slice for dessert. I would think that the cake would be too much to take in after I had beer, finger food and a big bowl of laksa.. However to my surprise, the cake wasn't too creamy and heavy for dessert. It was perfect to end the night. Thank you Creatures for the experience 
5
I had visited Creatures for lunch, to check if the restaurant was suitable for a Xmas gathering with friends. I was taken in by the cosy decor and the efficient and well spoken staff. Head chef Jardine though busy doing a catering event ,was very professional and attentive to my questions and willing to tailor a menu suitable to my requirements. The food was well executed in taste and presentation - stand out dishes are the Miso cod with Ulam onigiri, ah ma and ah Kong noodles, and the delectable durian cake . They have more creative dishes on the menu which I will go back to try in future. Expect a delicious meal, with generous portions and great service!
5
We came here as we were gifted a copy of the EAT Singapore 2017 book. Yes this place is a bit 'ulu' with not much foot fall - but you still have to book! Having been here once before, we did not expect to be even more impressed the second time! The hot coconut latte was fragrant and truly unique, and the blue pea latte which we ordered iced was also refreshing and tasty. Next up, the halloumi burger (yes, very veg friendly establishment) and zhu burger (for the pork-loving ones among us) were both delicious and highly satisfying. The fries were just lightly salted and perfectly flavoured that they could be eaten without the aioli on the side. We were served by Dominic who provided us with excellent, thoughtful service - he even prepared a patio seat for us to enjoy our dessert of Le Peranakan cake! Dessert was a very interesting creation which blended typical Peranakan flavours into a fascinating, delicious dessert. A wonderful end to the meal. Thanks for the memorable experience - will be back

CreatureS is a nice restaurant tucked away in Little India. Came here to try their famous laksa and a couple of other dishes. The laksa was delicious, probably some of the best I’ve ever had. It was pricey at $24 but worth giving it a try. The other dish that was absolutely delicious was the rendang lamb shank. A little more expensive at $34 but totally worth it. The lamb was tender and juicy with great rendang flavor.The atmosphere of the restaurant was cozy and warm and the service was excellent. Definitely recommend giving this restaurant a try
5
For a true local experience -this is the place. The service was wonderful and the food was remarkable. The price is truly worth it. We liked it so much that we came back - so we ate here twice in 4 days. Family recipes with a new creative spin. For a total experience of the best of Singapore, this is the restaurant for you

It's good to see creatureS attempt for a Christmas menu. Not sure if it's to accommodate additional Christmas menu that they decide to put on hold certain more popular main dishes e.g. crayfish dish... My party of 5 arrived for our reservation at 1245pm. Not certain if it was truly full house but we waited for nearly an hour for our dishes. Ah gong chicken cutlet noodle was relatively good. Dishes such as spicy prawn linguine, stewed chicken were unimpressive. The irony is that Ah gong chicken cutlet which seemingly required more preparation time came much earlier than spicy prawn linguine that required less cooking time. A wait of nearly 1 hour was required for spicy prawn linguine. Hope that the menu for popular main dishes can help to revive the poor impression of this visit, provided that there is opportunity to return back to this restaurant
5
After hearing good things about Creatures, it was with great anticipation, I finally booked a table and it did not disappoint! What a lovely evening! Food, cocktails, staff and setting/ambience were superb! We’ll be returning! Portion size was good and each dish delicious, tender and flavourful! (Cocktails took a while to be served, whilst worth the wait, it would be a small note for improvement) Thank you to all staff and compliments to the chef!!
5
The communal and main dishes are a twist of local cuisine with a bit of Peranakan flavour. The desserts are mind blowing. Especially the chocolate cake. The chocolate cake is served with sea salt caramel and coconut ice cream. I’m salivating while typing this. The chocolate cake is one of the best I’ve ever tasted. The combination goes really well perfectly and my words really don’t do justice to this really excellent chocolate cake. You just simply got to try it for yourself. The chocolate cake cost S$18 and it is worth every single cent. Do share the chocolate cake with family and friends as the portion maybe big for one to finish. The miso cod is also another must try in the menu. The cod fish is cooked to perfection and goes really well with the sambal belachan definitely a must try at CreatureS**Highly recommend the chocolate cake and miso cod fish.Apart from that, this restaurant has a really nice ambience with great service staffs. Great effort has been put into the slightest details in this restaurant. You got to be there to experience it for yourself!
5
Charming, small, funky, and traditional--all at once. Local heritage dishes (including duck soup from Granny's recipe) with a welcome and delicious twist. Have been for lunch twice, downstairs and upstairs. Weekday lunches are the bargain.
Highly recommended.
4
Food is delicious and service is attentive. Tried the durian cake which was good. Prices though abit on the high side.
5
Found this restaurant on a specialist food guide. Small restaurant with contemporary style. Had the set menu lunch. Fresh innovative Asian dishes and decadent dessert cakes. Great coffee.Service excellent and value for money.
5
Made reservations and was given a table upstairs. Host was very knowledgeable and gave good suggestions to the food we ordered. Constantly checking on all tables and was never neglected despite it was relatively full on a Sunday evening.
4
The other food like chilli crab is good. There’s a slight drop in the standard of the durian cake, kinda dry. Or maybe it’s just that particular day. Staff are friendly !
5
The must go for fusion restaurant, with good food and pastry. Highly recommended for business lunch.
5
The food and drinks are all nicely presented. So instagramable. All our food are tasty ... v v yummy. We love their risotto and ah gong & ah ma noodle. Durian cake is another must try (order early to avoid disappointment)!!We are so coming back to CreatureS!
5
Absolutely love the ambience. Atmosphere was very pleasant, comfortable with prompt and experienced staffs. We had the Kyoto Desker - A somewhat bizarre yet surprisingly tasty cold tofu mixed with century egg and salted egg sauce. I know it sounds weird but it's really good!We also had the 'One night in Taipei" - which serves Singaporean all time favourite 'Lu Rou Fan' in short, and " I must have this spicy prawn pasta'.They were tasty, the tastes/spices/fusion complement each other well and sizable portions. The madame butterfly latte and honey longan latte are really very intriguing and delicious. Please do give them a try!Desserts were of real high quality. Durian lovers, the durian cake is filled with Mao Shan Wang Puree - how heavenly does that sound? The 'upside down' goreng pisang is one of my favourite. It goes extremely well with the very soothing coconut ice cream. The banana cake, is really amazing! Freshly baked, and of great quality! Im loving it totally.Highly recommended! Will be back for more! :

As one who’s retired & wonder around the world for food. This was a hit the first time I visited with the same group of friends. Only this time, not only I was disappointed but the rest of the others felt a complete let down.The ambience is good. Staff as always friendly. The last time, we tried to order the laksa. It was not available & given it’s on today. It was to me .. a complete let down. Let’s put it this way, @ $25 I expected more ... Lim a taste of WOW factor. Laksa soup was just ordinary. Give me Katong laksa @ $4.50 anytime please.Next disappointment was the Har Mee. $26 for a bowl of Har mee with a piece of pork rib, 3 big prawns, fish cake and .... again, the let down was the broth. It tastes prawn soupy alright but you look at the colour, it don’t seem right n taste good. The soup base unfortunately was simply ordinary. I love my Har Mee. I have it all the time from old airport, to a hidden gem in Toa Payoh block 127 to flying to Penang for Har Mee. Completely, let down. Please give it another GO n go back to basics on the Har Mee.Fortunately, the fried Hokkien Mee was a delight. We told them that it would be more appropriate if chives were served with this dish instead of spring onion.Entree of meat ball was delicious. Cake was good, coffee was great to end a Long lunch.Hopeful that it grow n mature with age. Next time, it’s better than this visit

We came here on a local friend's recommendation and was pleasantly surprised. The service was great, the staff and owner found out we were tourists and offered their knowledge on this to do and see.The cakes, oh my, never had a better chocolate cake. Looks like a mud cake, but without the heaviness of one. Paired with a salted caramel sauce that is just right, served with a scoop of coconut ice cream. We had a slice between the 2 of us and could seriously had more. The durian cake was also delicious. Made from fresh durian. I thought it had the right amount of sweetness, my wife thought it was too sweet. So maybe it's a personal taste. Overall, the presentation of the food, the environment, the staff were all great. We will definitely make a trip back for the cakes and probably dine there on our next trip.

Although not much variety for lunch set but the food selection is quality, delicious. Dessert was indeed good

1. I don't go dining or places that food menu without picture, as difficult to decide what to order. So it come as a surprise to many of my friends, i decide to visit CreastureS and write a review. 2. It locate near MUTAFA area, good location and easy to find. We reach about 6pm, did not reserve but managed to get a table at this great local restaurant. It's quite small and it seen very popular, hear that it is nearly always fully booked, and i got to give up my table at 8pm for next guests. 3. So a menu without food photo, how we select? Got to base on name and just choose , haha, but surprise the few disk we order is something we did not taste it before at other restaurant - delicious, small mouthful sized portions of all sorts of tasty and flavoursome asia+western dishes.4. Charismatic waiter & waitress made the dining experience a good one, the atmosphere is good and a thoroughly enjoyable way to eat excellent and different authentic A+W food.5. CreastureS is an undercover gem in Singapore! we were initially skeptical about the food quality and range, but we are so pleasantly surprised to see good ambience, great food quality and good service that exceeded our expectations. 6. Special mention to the chefs who worked hard behind the scenes, hope next time got opportunity to have a chat with them. The service staffs are also great - Jacqueline , Emily & Dominic , with good service attitude , makes all the difference when dining. Thanks to all and I would strongly recommend CreastureS to anyone interested in having a great meal!➖➖➖➖➖美味的食物、舒適的氛圍及良好的服務品質一般情況下，我不會踏入”沒有食物圖片”的餐廳，理由是在沒有預先看過我所點的餐點總會讓我有抉擇的困擾。因此，在我決定要踏入這間餐廳-CreastureS並撰寫評論的時候，對我的很多朋友來說，是一個相當大的突破。首先，這間餐廳位於MUTAFA附近，擁有優越的地理位置，且容易找到。我於下午6點左右抵達，且沒有事先預訂，並設法在這間當地餐廳尋得一張桌子座位。餐廳整體空間看起來不大，聽說總是完全預訂額滿，可知相當受歡迎。因此，我僅能擁有2小時的用餐時間，不過2小時的用餐時間已經足夠讓人充分享受一頓美好的晚餐。就坐以後，對於完全沒有食物照片的菜單，我該如何選擇？僅以名字為基礎，所做的選擇，讓人對食物更增加了一些想像空間與期待，而服務人員也願意耐心替我介紹菜餚的特色，以及分享人氣餐點作為選擇依據。而在等待餐點的時光，環顧四週的用餐環境，清爽的牆面配色，更以許多盆栽植物作為點綴，為整個餐廳增添了幾份綠意盎然的姿色。在上菜之後，擺盤的藝術能使人食指大開，且令人感到驚喜的是，許多的菜色不僅僅是文字上所表述的特徵，CreastureS提供了亞洲+西式菜餚的結合，增添了許多前所未有的口感與層次，這是在其他餐廳所未體驗的。 此外，親切又體貼的服務更使得這次的體驗更上一層，讓所有賓客都有賓至如歸的感受。特別感謝在幕後為我們提供美味餐點的廚師，希望下次能有機會與他們一同分享對於食物美味的堅持。服務人員 - Jacqueline , Emily & Dominic，良好的服務態度，讓我們有著愉快且舒適的體驗。綜上所述，CreastureS初訪的體驗，從我們最初對餐飲及服務抱持期待又怕受傷的心境，出乎意料之外的餐點品質以及讓人愉悅放鬆的服務態度，遠遠超出了我們所預期的，CreastureS是新加坡餐廳的一個瑰寶，將會再次造訪

@TheKuoKnowsWarm and inviting. Edgy and exciting. CreatureS exudes a sense of anticipation as soon as you walk in the door.It is supposed to be East meets West. The East in this case being Peranakan. But there are times when it is hard to discern which one of the cardinal points has the upper hand.The Garden & Crab Risotto is unquestionably delicious. But it is also something that could be on the menu at any Italian restaurant. It can do with a bit more Eastern influence.The Rendang Lamb Shank was generously portioned. It was definitely tender but it could have done with a bigger kick.The signature Miso Cod with Ulam Onigiri was a standout. It should be at forty bucks a pop. The cod, with a sweet glaze, was cooked to perfection. The ulam salad was crisp. And the Onigiri, when smashed and mixed with the other items, brought the whole dish to life. Top marks.CreatureS shows potential. It could be a Singapore great, if it is more courageous with the seasoning. Don't settle for home comfort. Go for the home run
4
Unexpected. Both food and location were interesting juxtapositions - Peranakan restaurant in Little India and fusions of authentic traditional Nonya-Baba flavours with other Asian cuisines.Great looking restaurant, with an interesting drink offerings. The night was fairly full, but the staff still managed a personable service. The food service was prompt and all the dishes well cooked.For me, the Kyoto Desker cold tofu was delicious, but the huge plateful of century egg sauce made it a bit cloying. The Taipei pork rice bowl was not peranakan, but delicious none the less. Their signature Miso Cod - fish brilliantly cooked, but really odd pairing with the sambal belacan and plum sauced cucumber salad - the manager did assure me it was better eaten all together with the ulam rice. As it was presented so beautifully in parts, perhaps the staff should suggest how to eat the dish, for full appreciation. The fish is such a hero, it's almost as if it has to compete with all the other elements.Enjoyable, but be prepared for the unexpected
5
We loved your restaurant. Already look forward to makaning our way through the rest of the menu. The food was outstanding, from entrees through to dessert. Authentic with modern elements. The service was instant. Dominic and Jacqueline dealt with every request instantly in a fully-booked restaurant.The ambience was sublime and relaxing lemongrass infused. You are as far away from our home time-wise as a drive to Albany and Sandy Nugawela loves SG....so there....fair warnin
4
The place is not easy to find , so plan ahead . Love the chocolate cake , it's huge and moist, with a scoop of coconut ice cream.
5
This is the go-to restaurant whenever I need a break or have a date. Enjoyed the food a lot as usual.
3
First, the positives. Restaurant is tastefully decorated, with a warm and sophisticated ambience, and even scented, with what we believe to be lemon grass scent. Service was also very good, both from the servers and owner, who made recommendations and kept coming back to make sure everything was OK. Food looked very pretty when it came and chocolate cake and Thai iced tea cheese cake were both excellent. The rest of the food? Small portions, pricey, clumsy execution and a bit of a hit and miss. The bottom of the list was the roast duck salad- not enough duck, not enough lettuce, it looked and tasted sad. The other disappointment was the lamb shank rendang. The gravy (or marinade, if any) didn't seep into the meat, which meant the shank was on the bland side: so it was really eating bland meat with gravy. Moving up the list, the potato salad was good but again, portion was small. The kueh pie tee and ngoh hiang were not bad but not any different from what you would get at other restaurants. The best dish was probably the miso cod, but at $40, also the most expensive. We agreed that we would all come back again, but only for the cakes. The mains and salads were not terrible, but not exceptional either, and a bit too pricey for the portions.
4
We stayed at Hotel Boss near the area called little India. As usual I checked the restaurants in the area on TripAdvisor and I followed my feeling and picked Creatures! Enthusiastic staff and or owners I am not sure who was who. The interior is very nicely done! I felt at home! The menu is a good choice of nice dishes. We all choose the crayfish dish. Fresh and well prepared. (Sorry I forgot the name) Very taste and quality food! Staff was excellent and so is the food. Next time I travel to Singapore I will come back for sure! Keep up the good work and you will be successful
1
I went to try the food because I was keen to order the mooncakes. After they told me to give them the details for my order earlier in the week, they failed to reply even on the day before I was hoping to collect the mooncakes. And couldn't give me a satisfactory reply when I arrived. Duck rice roll tasted stale but the chef insisted it was fine. Their mac & cheese was delish and durian cake to die for. But the upside down goreng pisang was dense and their champagne sorbet flat
5
My friends and i looking for a Restaurant around Desker and we chose CreatueS.The Risotto is nice and Babi pong teh highly recomended by Saling. He really looked after us the entire dinner. Definitely we will return back because of the great service. Goodjob Saling
4
The decoration of the place is really modern, trendy and good taste.The food is prepared especially for you as you wait for 15 minutes to get your meal which is excellent !The service is also refined as far as they're very comprehensive. I chose the Laksa for which it was specified "midly spicy" but it came super super strong, as I'm really used to spicy food. They immediately changed my meal for another one of my choice. I just had to wait for the preparation. The crab risotto was perfect !Our dessert (we took the chocolate cake to share) was so good and was so big !You can try this restaurant with absolutely no hesitation ! We loved it 
3
We went there because of its durian cake. It is really nice and rich despite of the price. We also tried cempedak cake and duck roll. Cempedak cake with ice-cream is good too. The duck rice is creative, the idea i give the credits. What you see from Chinese creation turn another look at western plate, but taste no change and price increased
4
Went here on recommendation from my hotel , and only a short 5 minute walk away.The main dish was so huge that it was all I could eat!CREATURES LAKSA $24Quintessential Nonya laksa served with fresh prawns, quail eggs, chicken, fish cakes and cucumber laces simmered in a signature rich coconut laksa broth. a modern take on a traditional Peranakan classic(mildly spicy)Good service and funky ambiance . I would go back to try other dishes
5
Managed to get a booking for Friday night and was not disappointed with their Peranakan offerings!My partner ordered the "Creatures Laksa" while I got the "Urban Baba Ayam Buah Keluak".The first thing that struck us was the size of the servings - both of us did not finish so you can say they are generous with serving sizes.I haven't had many laksas but this was the first one I've tried with 2 quail eggs though I felt it complemented the fresh prawns, chicken and fish cakes well - one thing to note - the gravy was both thick and SPICY! The laksa bowl seemed like it was 20cm in diameter and about 10-15cm deep, it was that large.As for my dish, it felt like a chicken stew with a tangy taste of rempah (a spice used in Peranakan / Nyonya cuisine) and also buah keluak (a large seed used in this cuisine as well). Though it wasn't visible in that lighting, there was also minced prawns and pork in the dish - another warning - this was spicy too though having the nonya chup chye (cooked veges) and steamed rice helped to give balance.To top off the dinner, we ordered one of their famous chocolate cakes. For someone who doesn't have a sweet tooth, I can see why they are sought after... they somehow struck the right balance by serving the cake with coconut ice cream. In sticking with the theme of the night, we didn't finish the cake either.In summary, we would happily return to try their other offerings - in fact, we took away a slice of Thai Tea Double Fromage and also their Upside Down Goreng Pisang... and yes, it tastes like the real thing
5
The atmosphere was great. Service is good and the location is easy to find. The durian is awesome. Will visit again and try other dishes.
5
went with friends for the durian cake. it is really awesome. staffs are friendly and good service standard. will revisit again.
3
We had had a fabulous dinner at Creatures before so was excited to be returning. Once again the food was inventive with great flavours, unfortunately the service was offhand and disinterested. Very much the opposite to out previous visit.
5
Inviting my BFF to celebrate her birthday at creatures one word to say food was excellent having his own style. Will bring more friends over for dinner.
5
Had a lovely lunch with my family @CreatureS. Great service and the food was great. I love the chocolate and durain cakes!
4
Requested for a change in the slice of cake cause the initial one served had a hole in it (wanted to take an instagram-worthy photo), and they did it without saying a second word. Double thumbs up! They also told me to sit down while waiting for my table to be prepared as I was running a little late from my reserved time due to the rain
5
Heard many of my friends raving about this place so I decided to pop by with my friend this afternoon for lunch. We were seated on the 2nd floor and I've got to say the ambience is amazing. The scent of lemongrass is strong but yet pleasant, definitely felt very relaxed. My friend and I had a hard time deciding what to eat (TOO MANY OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM). The female staff was kind enough to recommend some of the signatures and special and we chose laksa (only avail on weekends) and beauty beast. The laksa was thick and creamy, different from those you can find outside. The beauty beast was SPICY but I love it. To end off our lunch, we ordered the choc cake recommended by the staff and IT WAS AMAZING. We tried so hard to finish it as it was so huge but good. The staff then came to check on us and asked if we take durian as they have samples of the mooncakes but we are not durian lovers. She still offered, we tried it and it was not bad. Maybe we would consider trying the durian cake the next time we visit again
3
We came here on 10/08 to celebrate my bdae, and specially to try out their signature laksa. But to our disappointment, we were told by their staffs that it's only available during weekendsNothing really interest me on their menu bcuz most of their meats are pork (I dun really eat pork thou). Thus hun ordered "Ah Gong Fried Chix & Ah Ma Noodles" for me. I would say I'm caught by their portion. The chix is tastefully nice & crunchy, the portion of the noodles is a tad too many for me. It would be nice if the noodles had a little flavouring.Hun ordered his "Zhu Burger". I was given a mouth taste of his burger. It's nice and no "smell" of porky taste. But the fries that came along with, we find it too oily.Hun was kinda disappointed with the staffs bcuz I knew that he secretly gotten the staffs to prepare a slice of MSW cake, but it never came. thus he had to personally went up to one of them to bring it up. Overall experience is . We will come back again for their laksa.
4
Finally visited after eyeing the durian cake for ages..Partner and I had two drinks, two mains, and a dessert between both of us. Portions were huge for the mains, I'll consider getting a starter and main for sharing next time?We had the Zhu Burger and Beauty and the beast (lol at the names). Beauty and the best was really spicy and piquant! While we were thoroughly stuffed, we couldn't leave without trying the durian cake.. but unfortunately it went out of stock.. had the chempedek cake instead which was a-ok.Service was great too - initiative without being obstrusive. Will return again for the durian cake
5
Our first time here, heard good raves about it so we booked in advance for Sunday lunch. We ordered prawn fritters, beetroot salad and cuttlefish rolls as starters, then ordered beauty and the beast (i.e. Curry crab with vermicelli), and crayfish hokkien mee, finally to top it all off was the durian cake with real durian fruits layered in chiffon cake. All was amazing dishes and big portions, we thought the curry crab was a bit disappointing as it only got spicy curry water flavor while all other dishes were so flavorful. There's not a lack of fusion cuisine in Singapore but here their creative fusions paid off and really impressed us as seasoned foodies. Decor and ambience also very nice and cozy with friendly staff, it's a place you'd like to hangout. Would definitely recommend friends here
5
Applaused for the food and service quality. I customized a menu of 4 course and each of them was exquisitely prepared. Big love!
4
Food portion was too big. Need to go with minimum 4 pax to share 2 main and 1 side. Hokkien Mee was over rated.
5
A beautiful space (that smells great by the way). The service was very friendly and very quick. Now the food, was lush. You have to try the Kyoto-Desker, the Miso Cod and the Chocolate Cake.
5
This place is highly recommended for big group of friends, the food is awesome with great Ambience and both of the staff that served us is friendly! Thank you Jacqueline & Edward for your great services. Will definitely visit here again! :)
5
I was served by a waitress named Jac. She was really helpful in the menu and she did a great job in making us feel comfortable. The food was delicious and unique. Really enjoyed my time there. Would go back again. :)
4
Cool interiors with real plants and fresh flowers. Can smell lemongrass the moment you come in.
Recommended food: ngoh hiang, duck and pear salad, la mian and chocolate cake with salted caramel. Enjoyed them a lot.
Great cheerful staff too. Shoutout to Edward and Saling!
5
Stayed for a good 3-hour dinner + bonding w my friends and we had fun .. the chocolate cake w salted caramel is diviiiiine!
5
Went for lunch and I must say , there was only 1 service staff seen but his service was superb. From time to check he was checking in on us , asking how's the food ,if it's ok for us. We settled for lunch set at $28 ++ per set, thought its was pretty sufficient to come w starter, main course , dessert + longan tea drink. We upgraded 1 of our desert to theLegendary durian cake. Tasted good for us. Worth a visit since everyone is talking abt this place
4
Wide variety of choices on menu. Local dishes such as the fried Hokkien mee, meat bun, laksa, dumplings, etc are given atas upgrade. For instance, the fried Hokkien mee at Creatures contains a full crayfish on top of the usual prawns and calamari. This makes the price 5x higher than if you taste the local version at a more humble venue such as a hawker centre or food-court. Nonetheless, it is still very worth a try!Restaurant bookings are usually filled up in advance. So do reserve places.They are also famous for their durian cake. This needs advance reservations as well. Their version is very pulpy, and full of the fruit. However, the chiffon cake in between the layers is a tad dry. Our ratings range between 8-10 out of 10 for the cake though, which makes it one of the best in Singapore.The latte was very well made. No bitterness and its the right temperature

I was at the cafe with a group of friends celebrating a friend's birthday. Ambience was great, very cosy and intimate. The waiter was very friendly and welcoming, and he even gave us a bowl of truffle fries on the house. I had the Fried Chicken and Noodles which was really good. They are famous for their durian cakes which you must reserve beforehand. Will definitely visit again! :
4
Was pleasantly greeted with confirmation of reservations and given a nice corner table. The service was good and ambience suits the fusion local cuisine. Will definitely return!!
4
Ordered the durian cake, duck soup and prawn fritters. Durian cake was decent. Duck soup is a miss. Prawn fritters a hit.
4
use of American style of presenting the dish while ensuring the authentic taste of Chinese food is maintained
5
Good food, nice ambiance, warm hospitality! Perfect place to hang out with friends or family on a lazy afternoon. If you drive, parking may be challenging.
3
Hokkien mee was overrated. Staff was very friendly though. Durian in durian cake was nice, but sponge was too coarse.
5
The pork belly was wonderful - as was the crab. Finished by great cake.. Enjiyable atmosphere in this lovely old building.
5
Creatures is a welcome relief from the very traditional Indian restaurants in Little India. Great styling, great food, fab music, very very good and can't wait to come again.
3
Very pretty place, pity about the food. The 4 of us ordered:Roast duck and pear salad: This was pretty refreshing, loved the duck and the plum sauce dressing. The accompanying keropok was not very crispy though.Kong Bak Pau: The buns were fluffy and the pork belly wasn't too fatty but at $22, it was pricey. Zhu burger - Burger patty was falling apart and was very dry, only saving grace of this dish was the crispy fries.Ah Gong Fried Chicken and Ah Ma Noodles / Ah Pek Har Cheong Pork and Ah Ma Noodles: The meat in both dishes were very dry and pretty tasteless. Noodles were acceptable but again at $23 / $24, the prices were not justifiable for this.I Will Eat This Spicy Prawn Pasta: This is the best among the 4 mains but it was only just acceptable
4
Very interesting use of regional spices, every dish was a creative spin of its original. There are hits and misses but I believe all are worth a try! Reserve the durian cake in advanced to avoid disappointment. It's a double-storey shophouse so ask for lower floor if someone in your party is limited in mobility.
4
Was recommended by a fren to check out this place. I am not a person who likes durian cakes or pastries with durians.. but this durian cake is light, flavourful and the combination of the white cream completes and balanced the whole flavour. Chocolate cake was excellent too and moist! I would have prefer if sea salt is cut down on the frosting of the inside layers of the cake, besides the top layer. Had whole lunch meal there, but would definitely come back for desserts!
5
Food is interesting and always good, but the cakes really stand out here. I've been several times and the chocolate cake is incredible. Highly recommended.
3
The food title was very unique and localized. The service staff were friendly and prompt in their service.
4
Durian cake, hands down best ever. Closest thing you will eat to a real durian on Geylang. Gotta have the Babi Pongteh and spicy prawn pasta. Overall chill environment, good place to catch up with friends and family. Service staff super smiley and friendly.
3
Food was average. The place was too dark. Due to the dim lighting,I could not tell whether the chicken was fully cooked. Service staff could be more smiley though.
4
Food is well-presented. A good place for friend's meet up n chill. Parking space is limited though, with some road side parking lots.
4
A restaurant which serves exotic fusion cuisine- pretty special & worth a try. As for the dessert, there were a variety of cakes to choose from & tasted great as well.
4
The chocolate cake & durian cake was awesome! Packed with flavour! You can taste the durian meat in the cake! As for the food, although the laksa gravy was thick and flavourful, it was also a little too thick for one person to finish up one serving. Same goes for the hokkein mee. Would def recommend sharing
5
So we stepped into CreatureS after a long walk from the train station.Upon entering, we were greeted with the alluring scent of lemongrass in the restaurant. We got to sit upstairs and the warm lighting and flowers just set the mood. Now we were hungry, and excited to try the dishes. First let me mention:You can't eat here alone. Bring friends because my lord, the potions here are for sharing. I guess if you have an amazing appetite you can come here alone. But, what's the fun in that?Secondly, the menu does rotate and change. I suggest you give them a call to see what they're having for the night.Anyway, back to the food. So we order truffle fries, french bread/butter, ngoh hiang/kueh pie ti, hokkien mee, laksa, and the babi ponteh. And for desert, we have chocolate cake, durian cake and the lychee martini cake. First, the truffle fries came. So, this isn't the first time I've had truffle fries. But, my god, this one takes the cake. Crispy and paired with grated Parmesan, this one got us expecting more and more from them. And to our delight, they delivered. The kueh pie ti and ngoh hiang got us good. Fried to perfection and with the filling seasoned so beautifully, they certainly make Peranakans out there proud. The hokkien mee with the crayfish was great, but the broth could have been better. That's just my opinion. Anyway, the others at the table disagreed with me. The laksa is so, so good. The broth was smooth and lemak. Very often, the broth can turn sour from the coconut milk being constantly heated. Not here. Paired with prawns and quail eggs, we were pleasantly surprised that they could execute this dish very well. The best dish was the Babi ponteh. Easily the best I've had. The gravy is nice and sweet/sour, and the pork and the fat just melt in your mouth. I would recommend pairing it with bread instead of white rice, as the bread, once dipped, is amazing. We ordered more bread just for the ponteh. Just to sidetrack here, the French butter is amazing. But it had to be sacrificed for the ponteh.Finishing our meal were the deserts. The chocolate cake makes awfully chocolate look like a cupcake from a kids baking class. It's unapologetically grand, rich and heavy. Layered with love, the top is sprinkled with sea salt for that taste. It was paired with coconut ice cream and finished with caramel sauce at the bottom. It's cake for royalty.The durian cake takes the cake (pun intended). Finally, a cake with real durian in it! Naturally, durian is polarizing; either you like it or not. But, if you're a durian lover, or want a good durian experience, go for the cake. It is less heavy than the chocolate counterpart as they use fresh cream. Sweet and simple. The lychee cake was refreshing and a new experience. Normally, alcohol based cakes are that of rum. But this was interesting. (Note, subject to availability as CreatureS rotates the menu).To end off the night, we shared an Afrogato, which is coconut ice cream with espresso poured on it. Normally, afrogato uses vanilla ice cream. The use of coconut is interesting and adds a nice refreshment. The coffee is bold and strong, and pairs with the ice cream perfectly. The ambience, flowers and environment, combined with the food, certainly deserves a five from me. It's been long since I've had a fuss-free and perfect dining experience.Thank you, CreatureS, thank you
4
The menu changes periodically and they serves up quality food. Good coffee too. Dessert is to die for, must try! Tried most of the dishes on the menu have not been disappointed yet. Go on try it out for yourself. If you are a durian fan must try the durian cake if still on the menu
4
Service was good as the waiter was very attentive to our needs. Food items were interesting as they were mostly fusion and were well presented. The atmosphere is great for chilling with friends and the decorations really set the mood and tone of the place to relax. A nice fragrance filled the air when we entered the place
5
The food are yummy but portion not big. Price is consider high especially the cakes and drinks. Signature durian cake is worth trying. It will be great if the lights are brighter, it is just too dim to take nice fotos.
5
The offers a variety of local food with a twist served in detailed generous portion. The service is fantastic practicing omotenashi dining experience. Will definitely comeback here and recommend to my friends.
3
We went here for lunch. The set meals were somewhat average but those of us who ordered from the ala carte menu (I had a prawn pasta) find it better. Only disadvantage is, the meals that are not part of the set are pricey.
4
it is a rather inaccessible place for those who are frequent mrt users and also very crowded on weekends
4
The interior is excellent. It just makes your food looked photogenic. Good food, this one way to promote Spore local food. But the spicy prawn pasta we had is not that spicy :) maybe our spicy tolerance is too high.
3
Food was served cold but presentation was good. Ordered a slice of durain cake and it was pretty small for the price
5
We went for a meal at CreatureS and had the most fantastic meal! The waiters were brilliant and the flavours of the meals was unbelievable. The ambience was great and we will definitely go again!
4
The food at creatures are very creative, and certainly aims to please, but the restaurant started to "chase" us out from around 8ish, as the kitchen was closing, and then the bar closed soon after that too. It's extremely bizarre to have a restaurant close so early, (granted on a Thursday). I would definitely come back, and probably repeatedly, but maybe bearing in mind dinner should start at 5 or something!Rest of the visit was good, and drinks were interesting as well
4
I was recommmended but was bewildered as I could not find many reviews..... is it good, I asked myself.The set lunch was Kong Ba Pao and my friend had spicy anchovy pasta : all 1st class. The cakes were even better..We'll be back soon for more !
4
Brought out mum here for Motherâ€™s Day celebration and she was pleased with the selection.Foods: Overall strong flavours and very creative peranakan dishes, which suited our taste but would turn away those hoping for bland & healthy looking foods. Generous portions, but felt jelak as we shared out the big bowl of laksa, the feeling of excitement turned into boredom towards the end of this dish. However, the cakes were so marvelous and one should not miss, it reignites our dying appetite and craving, ensuring a pleasant closing to a sumptuous feast.1. Ngoh Hiang & Cuttlefish Kueh Pie Tie: 4/52. Ah Gong Fried Chicken & Ah Ma Noodles: 4/53. Ah Pek Har Cheong Pork & Ah Ma Noodles 4/54. Creature Laksa: 3/55. Creatures Chocolate Cake: 5/56. Durian Cake: 5/5Environment: Nice cozy setting, interior deco, dimly lit and relaxed. Powerful air-con.Service: Very efficient and attentive staff.Others: Parking would be difficult on this busy street depending on your luck, can consider MSCP at Kelantan Lane (7 mins walk away)
4
Had my advance Birthday celebration with my cliques and I would highly recommend it as everything is good! Awesome atmosphere, place, service, food and not forgetting the cakes!
4
Quaint place tucked away in busy Little India. Interesting menu of fusion food. Was under the weather otherwise I would have tried the spicy items on the menu. Worth a revisit!
5
I love this place so much. From main to desserts. They worth your every calorie. Just run more after that lah huh! Lol.
2
Food was too salty for my taste. I had the pork with noodle dish; the sesame oil in the noodle was overpowering, and the pork crispy but soaked in salt. Music was too loud. The restaurant too cold.
5
Service was excellent. The staff were really friendly and helpful in explaining the menu as well as recommending to us what was nice there. The food was flavorful and really tasty as well. But what was worth it for me was the ambiance of the place. The strong smell of lemongrass and the relaxing vibe that the place gives off is really worth the visit. Also, though a little pricey, I still feel that the Durian cake is a MUST TRY. Overall, A good place to chillout with friends or to bring your date
5
Loved the food here. A wonderful twist on traditional Peranakan food. The chef has managed to reproduce all the lovely complex flavours of this challenging-to-cook and time consuming cuisine but manages to present it in a novel and modern way. Particularly lovely was the salted vegetable and duck soup and the cempedak cake with coconut ice cream. Staff are attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back
5
Love creatures! Went there with a couple of friends for a dinner date. We heard they the cakes were divine and we absolutely had to go there. When we arrived, we were also surprised that they also had such an interesting food menu (Peranakan x Western x Chinese fusion) and we were really spoilt for choice. The waiter was very helpful in recommending us the popular dishes and helping us come to a decision finally. Handling 4 indecisive ladies is a no mean feat and we were glad he was still so patient and delivered top notch service to us despite the giggles and erms and ahs.We enjoyed the Babi Pongteh, watermelon and feta salad, laksa tremendously. The highlight of the whole event were the cakes. We ordered a chocolate cake and a durian cake. You could almost taste a slice of heaven in your mouth. Most decadently delicious desserts that is worth throwing your calorie counting out of the window.Coming from 4 Health conscious ladies, this means something haha. We loved the ambience and had an enjoyable time there. Love the place and will definitely be back!Pro tip: Pre-order your cakes at the beginning of your meal (or even earlier before you come - pay a deposit if you must) to ensure that you have the cakes you want by the end of the meal. Limited number of slices available and you don't want to be disappointed.
5
Been here many times, one of my favourite places to recommend to friends and tourists. Ambience is awesome, and its always a gastronomical feast for me whenever i visit Creatures. Very good hosts especially Dennis and Edward who put a lot of effort into ensuring their guests all feel at home and are well taken care of. You can tell that its not just a job for them, but rather they are rather passionate about what they do, and they always make the best recommendations. This place is truly a GEM
5
Dear hubby decided that he wanted to throw me a surprise birthday dinner while we were in Singapore last weekend. He managed to get nine of my running crew to fly in for the occasion and even drafted a script for the waiter! The waiter in charge of us, Edward did a superb job of pretending to kick me and my small table of 5 out, to check out an alternative seating arrangement upstairs given that a "VIP" had booked our original table. As we went upstairs and I promptly got my surprise, we were seated and promptly served with cocktails. The 3 course set dinner and the cocktails was super yummy. Loved their take on Peranakan food- Rendang lamb shank and the special birthday cheesecake made by Chef Jacob, topped with blue pea flower agar agar was the perfect ending to the night. The atmosphere of the restaurant was Instagram worthy. So if you need a venue for a surprise party, the team in Creatures are your perfect West End team to execute the perfect surprise. Whether or not they can sing your favourite musical, can't comment but Edward and Chef Jacob looks like they would be most willing to try. Overall rating: Awesom

would definitely recommend going for the ambience however it is pretty inconvenient to get to.. the food presentation is very innovative and portions are huge - the mains could probably feed 2-3 pax (singaporeans probably even 4 pax)! the food tends to get a little salty for most dishes... and cakes are pretty sweet! please skip the creamy pork soup cause it really is weird tasting.. the duck soup is VERY salty so please avoid too..kueh pie tee was really good! must have.. the crayfish hokkien mee was a bit fishy so not a lover.. the cod fish was pretty good! and the prawn pasta was spicy but good!it is pretty costly as well - probably would go back for cakes and tea.. durian cake was tad bit too sweet..
4
Serving up traditional dishes such as Laksa whilst giving them a modern twist, CreatureS can be expected to give you a dining experience of both great food as well as a great atmosphere and service.
5
Big on quality. Big on quantity. Big on service. Reasonable prices for everything these big. Parking is a challenge. But you can always depend on the HDB MSCP 2 streets behind.
5
Unique menu with the BEST fusion food ever!!!!!!!! Never dissappoints!!!!!! Love this place, highly recommended...... You must try the a little of everything.. Go in a big group cos portions are quite big.
3
Food portions are fairly large and should be for its prices. Main, we shared curry, which was too salty and I take very salty foods. Desserts not so great, pretty average. Cakes a bit on the dry side.
4
We sat out on the cute rooftop terrace at first but had to go inside when it began raining. Until then we had enjoyed a great and unusual Asian fusion meal from a small but interesting menu. Inside: what is it with places in Singapore that think people want to sit in an icebox? Way too cold aircon settings! But nice ambience and decorations. If you go, bring a sweater
1
Was looking forward to dinner there. The 10 of us had different mains so we can try everything and I can tell u they all ALL awful. Only the fried chicken noodles can be accepted. All the others taste terrible. Service was the worst . Food took so Long to serve. Even a scoop of ice cream took 30mins. Ice water was not refilled when the cup is so small. We had to request the waiter again n again to refill but yet can forget. We spent $450 there for 8 adults. I find it costly for the normal food there
4
Nested in a shop Lot along Desker Road. Renovation & ambience is good and great place to relax . Btw, there's also sitting areas on the 1st floor and has a nice outdoor sitting area as well. Food is good although the price tag is a bit hefty. But then, all things come with a price . Try the spicy spaghetti which is spicy and it's tasty. If you're not one who can endure the spiciness, then go for the non spicy one ( you won't regret this move ). The kong ba Bao and duck salad are dishes to try as well. Finishing the meal with the durian cake is a must ! Calories comes later as it's a YOLO principle! Service is good & staff are friendly. Though the price is a tat heavy; it's well worth the food you will get . Recommend to try at least once

When we arrived we were told we could not use our Eat Singapore book because I did not indicate in my reservation that I had one. The hostess/waiter was adamant we could not use it. This set a negative tone for the entire dinner. However, the food was delicious and the other wait staff was very helpful. At the end of the evening we spoke with the manager who said yes we could use our Eat Singapore book. He was lovely and apologetic for the behavior of the hostess/waiter. Overall the restaurant was lovely. The hostess/waiter needs additional training.
4
Loved the first moment I stepped into CreatureS - the lingering lemongrass scent instantly sets up a mood for a good meal. The portions were generous - the highlight was truffle fries, the cakes (chocolate cake was divine) and the cocktails. Looking forward to come back to try the rest of the menu.
4
Great little place. Fusion food.
Staff are friendly & provide recommendations.
The tofu with spinach is awesome.
Deco & layout makes this a very cosy place.
Make reservations as they can get busy. Explains how good the place is.
5
Kong ba bao is flavourful and tender, the hokkien mee was never stingy about the ingredients and laksa was oh-so-aromatic. And of course, the best durian cake we have ever tasted! Not to mention, staff were friendly in their service. Will definitely be back!
4
Excellent food and service - can't do better than that. The food is delicious and stands out among our Peranakan favourites - especially the Kueh Pie Tee. Also a good bar and interesting cocktails. We will be back!
4
Asia fusion offering
Eclectic cozy decor that generate a relaxing atmosphere. Ample food selection, good value and excellent service. Lamb shank is a must. Anchovy past with soft shell crab is also very good.
5
Everything was exceptional! Ambience was great, food was amazing as usual (love the variety and their creativity in serving local cuisines) and staff were commendable. Second visit and not disappointed. Will return! Thanks for the warm hospitality, even on a full house Sunday night. :)
3
Weekday set lunches were more affordable as compared to their mains, priced at $2, which consist of a soup, main, dessert and drink. Top-notch, complimentary service but unfortunately, the hefty pricetag was a major setback for return visits. Moreover, the hainanese chicken rice roll that I had yearning to try was sold out only at 1.45pm ><
5
Fusion food is a description that normally has me going in the opposite direction but a recommendation from a foodie local who I trust meant I tried out Creatures. So glad I did. Great looking restaurant with a cool atmosphere and really good friendly service. And the food - excellent. Not a massive menu which is generally a good sign but plenty of choice for all tastes. We had a special seafood noodle dish which was fantastic, a lamb laksa which was tender and fragrant and a self assembly pork bun which was a real delight. Not too expensive and a good wine list. If you're looking for something a bit different and very enjoyable in Singapore then this place is well worth a try.
3
Unsure criteria used in Tatler's dining award but flavour may not be one of them.Too much focus on creativity while not enough on ensuring the food tasted good.Certainly not Best Restaurant in my assessment.Hope it improves.The fresh vegetables served with the prawn fritters were too hard to eat.The Hainanese chicken rice was wrapped in cucumber; better cuts and ensuring no skin or fat recommended.Risotto in swimmer crab soup looked pretty but tasted plain.The spicy prawn linguine not al dente; even if not hand made pasta they should not be so obvious to the tongue.The Thai milk tea cheesecake tasted dry in the cheesecake part.I am sure tiramisu can be better made rather than as a cake; the creation just didn't work, tasting as individual parts

Wanted to try this place out for a while after reading rave reviews about it. Booked our dinner last night at 8.30pm. It's almost always fully booked on weekends so its advisable to call up earlier to make reservations.It's located along Desker Road and it's quite easy to find it. You can also find parking spaces easily at the multi storey carpark at Kelantan Lane which is within 5 minutes walking distance from the restaurant. The deco of the place is Peranakan and reminds me of the old Malacca. We can smell lemongrass throughout the restaurant and it's surprising quite relaxing. There are two levels and we had our dinner at the upper level which is tastefully decorated. The service was prompt and friendly. We ordered 4 dishes, truffle fries, ngoh hiang & cuttlefish kueh pie tie platter, ah gong fried chicken & ah ma noodles and creatures laksa. We complimented the meals with a glass of Pinot Gris and Passauer Weiss Beers. Must say we over ordered and struggled to finish the food as the portions were quite big. We find the quality of the food generally quite good and tasty. The best dish was the Ah Gong chicken and Ah Ma noodles as it was really tasty and different from the la mian we normally eat. The laksa was just "so so" and we think it's overrated. Probably can get better laksa from the Hawker stalls. The truffle fries was good and goes well with beer. We probably will give the ngoh Hiang and kueh pie tie platter a miss the next time as we have tried better ones elsewhere. All in all, it was a great experience for us last night. Eating out is not just about having good food but having a good time out sharing with loved ones. We enjoyed the food, loved the ambience and was pleased with the good service. What more can one ask for

I were there with my husband to celebrate our 22nd wedding anniversary and valentines day on 14th Feb lunch. Due to this special day, 2nd level dinning area was closed for lunch because decorating preparation. We were disappointed at first and then one lady server take her initial saying she can arrange us to move to the 2nd level for dessert and coffee after our meals. The lady server is very friendly and attentive. Food at reasonable and affordable price. Ambiance is nice and cosy specially the huge flowers arrangement in the middle of 2nd level plus the sense of lemongrass within the restaurant. Will recommend to friends.
5
The ambiance is great and cosy. The staffs at CreatureS are well trained. They are very friendly and attentive. The concept of the dishes are very interesting.
5
The foods quality was great, the Atmosphere was romance and the service was best!
but the price is not cheap, I hope they will do some promotion to us.
5
Tucked in a corner at Desker Road, CreatureS hide. Its a great place for fusion peranakan food, great coffee and warm service. Walk in and you can just feel how clean the place is, its a nice place with a great ambience. Great for dates or just a casual dinner with friends. They serve up great food, and it went beyond my expectations! So if youre around the area, do visit
4
Finally went to try out their durian cake! Was yummy and the cake is filled with durian - 猫山王! Good ambience with nice lemon grass aromatherapy. For those who likes lemon grass...Another highlight was the lemon grass Martini. Pasta was a little too dry but still good. Will return to try other highlights - kung Bao Pao!
5
We were there on a tuesday afternoon to celebrate my colleagues' 24th birthday.The ambience was right, staffs were friendly and attentive (at all times!), and the food was the best I've tasted in Singapore. As an interior designer myself, the mood and feel that CreatureS manage to carry out is a huge success. We'd definitely be back for more!
2
A restaurant in a traditional Singapore double storey shophouse, decorated with taste, with painted murals and modern furnishing. Creatures serves asian (fusion ) and western food. Went there for lunch, the set lunch is great value for money, it comes with a soup, 4 choices of main course, 2 desserts and 2 ice cold drinks to choose from.
5
This is my second times within the last 10 days.the CNY special is an incredible dish . I used to eat this dish in vegetarian way but creatures did an outstanding job add on the meat ball making the soup more yummy!the meat ball also a bit different from the normal one. If you are a meat eater just visit the creatures you will find out the difference
2
We went in without a reservation and although there were plenty of tables available they played the oh I'm not sure if we can squeeze you in game. Eventually we were shown to a table upstairs which was a nice atmosphere.Initially the staff seemed good, we were shown to a bench whilst they preps the table, however once seen to the table half the cutlery was missing and one of the menus was a Christmas menu, no longer available. From then on attention seemed sloppy, seemed to be rushing around yet no one around us seemed to be served either.We specifically went there for the laksa after seeing a write up in a magazine, unfortunately my Husband was very disappointed, he loves laksa however this one was very, very thick and the seafood was virtually non-existent, it did have a million quail eggs (slight exaggeration) not much of anything else. I had a fish dish , I think it was cod, nice however the portion size was really tiny, more like an appetiser size, certainly not worth the $38, and tax.Very disappointed, cool looking place but food average, service less than average and value not worth it, probably wouldn't go bac
4
A typical Peranakan meal that has a "at-home" feel. We had duck soup (yum yum!), noodles with fried chicken, chap chye/curry chicken/rice and Bali (a refreshing dish). Dishes were flavourful but my main gripe was the expensive price tag to the dishes. Service was wonderful and the people were pleasant and courteous! Will hesitate however to go a second time due to prices of dishes.
5
The food was awesome. We had the Watermelon Salad, Miso Cod and the Lamb Rendang. The meat was so tender and very flavorful. Definitely a place to come back to. Edward who attended to us was knowledgeable and made very good recommendations on the dishes to try
4
They make great pastas and yummy burgers. They do all their dishes with an interesting take or twist. Great flavours. Their durian cake is to die for and is a must have!
5
Just tried the lamb rendang tagliatelle from the Christmas menu. What a fantastic and savoury fusion food! Definitely worth your time!
5
Dishes to try , miso cod and ulam onigiri, bali, roast duck and pear salad, imperial creatures. Friendly and helpful service staff.
2
first time there on reference from EatsSingapore - food interesting and would have returned for that but the service was unprofessional , rude and slow. my order was wrong and i refused to pay but the cost refunded. Wine put in a bucket of water, didnt understand menu and told at 10.20pm to do final order for dessert and kitchen wanted to close ?!
4
Brilliant food & great place for sharing flavour packed dishes amongst friends. I understand the food is a modern take on classic Peranakan food, but all I can say is awesome flavour combo's with great service & small but varied wine selection. Best laksa I've ever had ... masses of flavour! ... & save a spot to share either the Duran cake or very rich chocolate cake.We have a new favourite dinner spot.
3
The whole experience is very good. I love the service staffs for their attentive mood, the ambience is great, music was good. Only issue I have is the food and price does not justify the trip down there. With that price, I can go anywhere. The food is so so, not something to scream about. Price wise, scream as it burns a hole in the pocket

On arrival to the restaurant at one end of Desker Road in bustling Little India, we were seated in the upper floor, in a cosy and comfortable corner of the restaurant. This was suitable for a good conversation without distractions or rowdy patrons.Been wanting to try this place for the longest time, seeing it featured so often on Facebook posts. Had the laksa which I felt was a tad too rich and thick, but it generous portions of chicken and fish cake to go with it. For the price about 4 times of a hawker centre's (albeit without chicken pieces and giant prawns), that was to be expected. Chose the second seating for dinner which starts from 8.30pm, and by the time the Babi Pongteh and a few peranakan dishes weren't available, was quite a pity my date couldn't get to try it. Her alternative choice, the Ayam Buah Keluak was about average. Their tea concoctions with rather arty-farty names (moon represents my heart) suit the kind of food and helps wash down all that richness. My date had this really interesting tea, Kebaya Blue I think it was with a lemongrass base, that would change from blue to purple with the addition of lemon juice (a very strong lemon juice), and it also seemed rather gimmicky (ala some chemistry experiment). She was reluctant to add more lemon juice to the tea which was refreshing by itself as it made the whole mixture uber sour and spoilt the whole taste of the drink. To end the dinner, we shared CreatureS signature Mao Shan Wang durian cake which I had ordered a week before. I was expecting a more generous durian paste for the price. Not the best cake I would say. We were eager to try other cakes, such as the chocolate cake, from their wide selection but were too full by then.The servers were pleasant and welcoming. On her queries on the ingredient for that special drink, the server who wasn't very sure, checked and returned with some detail on the plant that resulted in that colour change phenomenon. Then later on exit, he wished us well and asked us to come back again. She was impressed by those gestures, which she claimed saved the day and brought the visit to a pleasant end. I would visit again to try out the many other dishes and desserts

Creatures is a member of a fast-growing hipster cafe movement in Singapore. Its food is somewhat unique among the crowd, opting to take traditional Peranakan cuisine (which has a long and rich history) and reproduce it using western techniques and package it in hip, ultra-modern westernized aesthetics. It's good and competently made, but not if you're looking for real traditional Peranakan food. The decor is decent but not outstanding.The one star deducted is for the pricing, which i feel the food and ambiance do not justify
1
Upon arrival, we were directed to sit upstairs and it was full house upstairs but empty downstairs. There were about 4 service crew upstairs but service was poor - no one was paying attention to the tables. We immediately ordered cocktails to start after being handed our menus, but the drinks only arrived after I had finish my appetizers. Both of the mains that I've ordered - URBAN BABA AYAM BUAH KELUAK and BABI PONGTEH were covered in a disturbingly thick layer of oil. All four appetizers and mains that I've ordered were so poorly executed, I couldn't be bothered to order desserts. Certainly won't be returning to this restaurant in the future

I visited CreatureS first when it was opened for 8 months. The experience then was great, service and food was fantastic. However, a revisit yesterday didn't showed the same kind of food standard that I was hoping for again. Service was good but not the food. Chocolate cake was abit dry. Har Cheong pork was too dry after frying.
4
Generally all dishes are delicious but I didn't enjoy the Buah Kluak as much as there was not enough of the paste. But my friend from Hong Kong loved the durian cake and laksa and would pay a return visit next time!
4
A good choice if you wanna go for candlelight dinner or planning for a proposal!
Or just to sit down for a nice piece of cake.
4
Interesting local foods offered on the menu with a slightly different variation to the typical mode of serving and cooking.
Good blends of spices and flavours but prices a little high generally
5
Was warmly welcome and brought to our seats. Tried the recommended food by the staff n the food came very promptly. The durian cake was super yummy!! Service staff were very frenly n the place is instagram worthy!
4
Great environment, great people. The food is good - 3.4/5, innovative dishes that is uncommon anywhere else. The price is quite steep though. Great for special occasions, but not for you daily dining pleasure due to price. Love the cakes - 5/5! Try Durian / Lavender Earl Grey and Orh Nee (Yam / Taro) Cakes. I also suggest you make advance reservation

Was there to celebrate my wife's birthday. But because her birthday falls in December, many places offer a Christmas menu, just like CreatureS. However, when we were seated,We were only offered the Christmas set dinner menu with limited ala carte items...I confirmed with our server that if this was the only menu available, and he said yes.. weird...We looked around and saw other tables eating food that I didn't see on our menu!I called out to another waiter to ask if there were off the menu food items, and he said that some of the items from the ala carte menu was available but not all.The second server explained to us that the ala carte menu was available but limited in quantity, which was fine by us. We managed to get some of the items we came here for in the end.Overall experience was excellent as was the food, but I felt cheated of sorts by being denied the ala carte menu.We would have accepted that the ala carte menu was limited in variety but we couldn't accept being denied it at all

I arrived early , around 18.00, the 1st guest of the evening. I was seated right away. Started with a gin Martini with lemon grass recommend by the staff. Very tasty. For appetizer I had the tomato cauliflower soup. The soup had a nice rich tomato flavor with a piece of( overcooked , sorry )cauliflower. It was served with some lightly fried bread that was a nice compliment to the soup. For main course I had Nonya laska. A thick stew of prawn and fish in curry with noodles toped with cucumber and it was excellent!! The prawn was sweet and the noodles perfectly cooked. The French wine offered on special was good and the service was attentive. The menu has some really interesting options that I did not try. I would go back and recommend

My friends heard of this place. We are due to catch up again for a meal so we decided to check this place out on a Thursday afternoon lunch. Booked, we did n we received a warm welcome from their waiting staff.4 of us decided to go for their set lunch @ $28 plus plus including a drink & desserts.Starter was the popular Peranakan salted veg with duck. Decent enough but I won't say it's the best I tried.There were 4 mains to select n per head is supposedly pick one main. No hesitation, we went for 4 different mains.1. The pasta with anchovies, was very good.2. The pork shoulder curry was also a delight.3. Stewed pork with steamed buns were good but nothing to rave about.4. Khao ya, chicken marinated n grilled was passable. Not great.We added ah gong fried chicken with noodles ... pretty good.Desserts were decent. S$8 extra to change from normal desserts cake to Durian cake which was very good. A pleasant nice place, good ambience. Staff were friendly but somehow, I think the restaurant owners seated one corner were simply "unfriendly" n too reserved. In the hospitality business, a smile or hope you are enjoying our food would have gone well with me.But ... not even a smile. Oh well. I go again ? Surely but not on my must do list for awhile

After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor I can only imagine that we arrived during a particularly bad time. 15 minutes passed before a drinks order was taken, however some of the drinks weren't available. Only after calling a member of staff over to take our food order were we informed that almost half of the menu wasn't available - surely we should've been informed as soon as we were handed the menu? The service afterwards was good enough and what we order from the remaining choices was decent but I'll probably leave it a while before heading back for another booking. Such a shame as it was a family members last night before returning to the UK.
5
Right from the get go, the service was amazing. The servers were smiley throughout and they were attentive but not overly intrusive into the dinner service. Food was AMAZING. It's our second time here and it will definitely not be our last. Kudos to CreatureS! Only gripe that it was a little noisy
5
The food was great! The ambience was good too. It is a highly reccomended place if you are looking for good fusion food, they have great noya dishes.
5
Special shoutout to Edward for the superb and stunning service! Place was pretty as always. Potent martinis....to wash down the good stuff!
5
Good service and awesome food. The food is abit expensive for cafe setting. Not near mrt. Will need to walk some distance if not driving.
4
The durian cake is soooooooooooooo nice, should come back again for the durian cake, good! And the environment there is so good!
5
Location is along minor road so please lookout for it however it is quite easy to spot. Food was delicious and service was good.

Arrived at peak time (around 8pm) and, not having made a reservation we had to wait a little while (only maybe 10 minutes). Our waiter's English was not so good ( I think it was more to do with accent rather than grammar) but we got by with him. My food was fine but my wife ordered Laksa which was extremely spicy. There was no indication on the menu that this was especially hot but it was hot even for me - who likes hot (Indian and Thai) food and had eaten Laksa before, but for my wife who likes mild to medium hot food this was too much. So we left the restaurant with me being full(having eaten half of my wife's laksa as well as my own food) and my wife resorting to a burger on the way to our hotel. We rated as average not poor because the food itself was fine - just too spicy
3
Was there with a bunch of foodie girlfriends who are very discerning with tastebuds. The first course was the tomato based soup with cauliflower served with crispy you tiao. Taste was rather one dimensional. There was no depth and all we could taste was spiciness.We all ordered different mains to try. The mushroom pasta/lamian was oily. The Naughty Nonya was very spicy and again lack a specific nonya oomph to it. I have had many nonya food and even if it is spicy, the aroma of the rempah should flow through to the taste buds. The babi pongteh was good though and the ah gong and ah ma's noodles was so- so. Love the mayo and chilli that came with it though.The saving grace was the durian cake.. though the cream on top tasted like non dairy whipping cream
4
With a new menu I decided to return. The food did not disappoint. The cauliflower and lentil soup with "youtiao" was pleasing to taste buds. The crazy "cheong fun" with spicy minced chicken and a garlic sauce was an innovative take on a common hawker fare. The pork shoulder in spicy curry served with rice and fried whole egg was large in portion and delicious.The mushroom linguine was good, but not its forte. It came for my friend when I was nearly done with the pork shoulder.Even after ordering, ice water was not served until reminded. This is a recurrent problem with its waitering staff. Either no training provided or they could not learn. There is a service charge.The durian cheese cake was a hit
5
Excuse the location, but once inside , you are transported into a world of asian fusion culinary delight. Excellent service and great food. Definitely and highly recommended. If you have booked a table try and be in the area a few mins earlier as its rather difficult to find a parking spot. All that wait and tension outside is taken away once you step into the restaurant filled with a lemongrass inspired scent.Calmness takes over as you are served by excellent waiters. Really interesting cocktails even if you wanna go out for drinks only and of course Great food. Every morsel of food was playing with our tastebuds. Definitely and highly recommended. Did i mention excellent service? (something that is absent in Singapore

Husband loves the CreatureS Laksa (only available on weekends) and is looking at being back to try the other items on the menu.I had the Ah Gong Fried Chicken & Ah Ma Noodles. I found the la-mien tossed in Fried shallot and light soy a little oily and bland. Enjoyed dipping the fried chicken in the chinchalok mayonnaise. Fried chicken was still juicy though I found the skin cooked a little too dark
5
Food was somewhat radical yet familiar favourites!
Excellent time with friends.
The durian cake was to-die-for! Always pre-order the durian cake!
4
The dishes were kinda weird in a good way as it's fusion. Tasted good but slightly on the salty side if u're health conscious. The drinks were good though! And must try the durian cake if u're there cos it's SO GOOD! Worth the dollars!
3
The timing for the food to be served was way too long. And for the pricing, the food is way over priced.
3
Overhyped. Most of the food were pretty average. Ordered around 8 dishes and only a couple of were good. Service was good thou, and place is nicely decorated.
4
Laksa is a must try and the durian cake was light, fluffy & full of durian pulp, however, do call to reserve beforehand.
5
It's not my first visit but service standard is getting better. Ain't like those places that ignore about the customer service when they gain the fame. I'm allergy to a lot of food, they always serve me right. Dedicated crews prepared fusion food that satisfied my tastebuds. Lotsa love to crews!

This restaurant is located at the mouth of Desker Road and is not difficult to locate. Housed in a pre-war shophouse, it occupies 2 stories and packs in as many tables as its space allows. Tastefully decorated with pieces of interesting-looking furniture, the use of flowers is evident everywhere; from the bathroom to the waiting and dining areas. The interior could get a little chilly, so you may find yourself a table outdoors on the second floor or put on something to keep you warm.The fusion of eastern and western items make for a interesting combination. We especially liked the Crazy Cheong Fun Revolution (minced chicken stewed with fried shallots and dark soy, served with steamed ‘cheong fun’ (rice noodle roll), lettuce & spicy tangy coriander dip) and Cauliflower & Pink Lentil with You Tiao (cauliflower florets simmered in vegetable stock, sprinkled with pink lentils, dressed with light coconut cream and served with fried fritters). Dessert was the highly recommended (that we had to pre-order) Durian Cake and Pandan Kaya Cake. Personally, we felt the Baguette with French Butter could be served toasted for that crispy feel. Service was attentive without being intrusive. This area offers some interesting eateries and this restaurant is definitely one of them.
4
ordered the Thai salad, Ngoh hiang and kueh pie tee, and ah kong noodles. The salad was a bit spicy for our liking (good to spare the chili padi or to put them at the side). the Ngoh hiang and kueh pie tee were good and yummy! the ah kong noodles was a bit dry with the spice-powdered chicken was not bad. Sat upstairs. too drafty, food gets cold very fast. generally, warm service give

CreatureS is a casual dining cafe located on Desker road (historically the red light district of Little India, now gentrified).The menu offers a mix of traditional local dishes and what is now described as ModSin (modern Singapore) cuisine. This style of cooking either updates traditional dishes or adds a local twist to western style dishes. On our visit, the place was packed with local diners. On the whole I'd say there are a few good dishes here though I'm not sure if I would make the trek to Little India again just to seek this out.What we ate that I thought worth writing about :- itek tim- deliciously piquant duck and salted vegetable soup. We're Glad they didn't mess about with the traditional Peranakan recipe - chocolate gado gado - a salad of poached cabbage and long beans served with crispy beancurd cubes and hard boiled egg. The CreatureS version was topped with belingo chips (an Indonesian cracker made from the ground melinjo nuts) and tossed in a rich and spicy dark chocolate and cashew sauce. This ModSin (modern Singapore) dish mostly worked though a few days after the meal, I'm still wrestling with whether I really liked it. It might help to ease up a little on the amount of the sauce but my guess is the regulars can't get enough of it (the dish is served with an extra portion of the chocolate sauce on the side). - durian cake - my favourite of the meal. This was light sponge cake in between layers of fresh durian cream. Very good stuff. - orh nee cake - orh nee is a traditional Teochew desert of sweetened stewed yam. The cake here has tender slices of yam and yam paste layered between a light vanilla sponge and coconut cream. A successful ModSin dish. The other dishes we had: the kong bak pau, ah gong fried chicken and ah ma noodles and naughty nonya' secret weapon (a pork curry) were mostly well executed though I have to note the potato in the curry was curiously rock solid which suggests it was a poor last minute addition to the dish.Service is friendly and enthusiastic. We were a party of three and paid about S$50 each for dinner

My friend and I visited Creatures one Saturday night for dinner. Finding a carpark was a nightmare. The restaurant was charmingly located in a quaint restored shophouse and the upper level boasts a lovely outdoor patio - great for drinks!Being just the two of us, we ordered a starter, main and dessert to share. The ngoh hiang and pie tee were yummy and tasty to start with. Right balance of spices in the rolls. At $24, the laksa was a massive heap of tasteless noodles, dried beancurd, quail eggs, sliced fish cake and scanty prawns. For that price, I would have expected more quality ingredients over quantity. It was totally disappointing.Luckily, the delicious house chocolate cake, a huge rich piece provided a scrumptious end to what would have been an unmemorable dining experience. It exudes a right touch of caramel and saltiness. Best to share this to avoid the rich cloying taste
5
The Chef advised us on the amount of food to order as the portions were quite big. The durian cake was awesome. We enjoyed dining here.
4
My friend and I went on a weekday dinner... Its really difficult to pull off fusion well but this place surprised with dishes made with homemade goodness, loved the nuoh hiang and prawn linguini pasta
3
Broth of hae has too much spice that musk the freshness of prawns. Found starters like chee cheong fun v ex ($12?) seats n tables r quite cramp and small. Fries r nice. Pork burger average.
4
You must be a foodie to come here, as parking is almost impossible. However, you will be well rewarded, as the cuisine is not only creative, but exploding in flavours. Having been disappointed at other restaurants by gimmicky western dishes fused with Asian spices (eg. chilli crab risotto), we chose pure Asian dishes. The simple Ngoh Hiang is fat and full of fresh ingredients. The Ayam Buah Keluak is one of the most scrumptious in town - tangy and fiery. The signatures Laksa (only available on Friday night and week-ends - why?) oozes a pleasant fish aroma and is so rich; our only suggestion is they could have reduced the generous offering of chicken and replace it with cockles. Leave room for the durian cake - was it a cake or pure mao shan wang durian with some sponge cake mixed in? The cooking can be slow, but with such delicious and rich food, maybe it's good to pace yourself
5
CreatureS was recommended by a local friend and we weren't disappointed. Food was a wonderful take on classic Peranakan with a modern twist. The space is bright and well-appointed with a bright upstairs area open in the evenings. We especially liked the At Rattanakosin, Kong Bak Pau, "I will eat this spicy prawn pasta" and the chocolate cake. We also heard the durian cake was brilliant but it was sold out during our visit. Prices were fair (for Singapore) and portions were reasonable. Definitely worth the visit
4
Contemporary Chinese-Malay food which the locals call Perenakan. Such a popular place we are lucky to get a table by making reservation the day before. However the place is cramped and seating are not very comfortable. Great food though and warm service. Unfortunately most o their signature dishes were sold out so better to reserve not just the table but also some of the dishes to

Multi-level sensory touch points is what I would describe about CreatureS. It is certainly not an easy task to write this review as certain experiences are simply indescribable where one has to personally immerse into this hidden gem; an oasis found tucked in bustling Desker Street.The moment of truth was a huge wow factor; greeted by the ever affable founder, Dennis. While it is only right to have eye contact during conversation, I was totally distracted by the smacks of beautiful bold colours that were splashed lavishly all over CreatureS. The main wall creates an illusion of bamboo art but instead of the same old green bamboos, it is black; charcoal to be précised. My eyes betrayed me as I was obviously not paying attention to what Dennis was saying. Before I could check the ground floor proper where the famed pastries such as the Durian Cakes and Rainbow Cakes are proudly showcased, I was whisked to level 2 where my table reservation was made.The flight of stair leading to level 2 exudes a sense of nostalgic as it reflects the personality of the conserved shop houses. The stair was coated with a rich layer of gloss lacquer retaining it's old charm while projecting modern glamour.While I have hardly gotten over the wow factors from the ground floor, level 2 continues to surprise and to create more delights. The scents of lemongrass and fresh flowers lingered on the way up. There is an outdoor seating surrounded with lush of green plants complemented with splash of chilli red wooden tables and chairs. The feeling is simply exhilarating prompting me to take selfie. The indoor seating is spacious and even when the restaurant was filled to the brim, you will find your own sanctuary. Most eateriesbmaximise seating capacity by placing tables at every possible space since rental is exorbitant in Singapore, CreatureS ensures that there will be "therapeutic space" to admire and smell the beautiful flowers that Dennis has personally picked and arranged on a weekly basis.Ambience sets the mood which in return the right mood whets up appetite. The saying is so true as whatever was served throughout the night all tasted so good. The plus point is that CreatureS does not use MSG and that's the baptism of fire to truly bring out the culinary skills of the chef. Using fresh ingredients is a must to bring out the goodness of food which CreatureS certainly did.It was not an easy task for us to make decision during order taking despite having experienced waitress who patiently explained what the dishes are. Everything sounded so yummy and there were only two stomachs to house the list of expansive menu. We had Bali for appetiser. Miso Cod & Lamb Shank for the main courses paired with NZ Pinot Noir and had the wondrous coconut ice cream in a pool of coffee liqueur and washed it down with floral tea infused with bergamot.It was a memorable fun filled evening and what I have written above is a far cry from the actual experiences that I went thought last evening. I arrived at 6.30pm while the skies were still bright and the last burst of sun rays entered through the windows of CreatureS to late evening where the candles were brightly lighted up thus creating a total different mood board. Thank you CreatureS for creating dining experience to new heights

First time there. Ambience was good. Place decor was nice. Love the duck & pear salad. The grandma & grandpa chicken cutlet & noodles was so so only. The noodles is nice but the cutlet was tasteless, don't even have the chicken sweetness. Was looking forward to the durian cake but aft eating it, didn't actually leave me with any desire to want to come back for more.

❤️ CREATURES ~ BEAUTY BEYOND WORDS ❤️ Awesome dining in an oasis of lush beauty that elevates beauty to the next level !! From interior design to lighting, floral, food, drinks, candles & even the toilet is so gorgeous, no detail is spared ! I Owner Dennis Chong is so charming & affable !! ❤️ Great fusion food with peranankan essence, efficient service, food serve promptly, MUST make reservation ! Both lower and upper level dining are equally charming but I prefer upper level. Popular restaurant, my seating is 630-830pm.

We finally visited this restaurant after hearing such positive reviews. The food certainly lived up to expectations but the the service and ambience fell a long way short. The meal was very over-priced for such a disappointing experience.We booked a table at 1pm for lunch and the restaurant was full when we arrived. The first thing we noticed was the noise! We had to shout to make ourselves heard over the loud music and the shouted conversations of other tables. This is mainly due to the small narrow space with hard concrete walls/floor and the lack of soft furnishings.At first the service was very attentive and the waiter was very good at helping us make our selections. Thereafter things started to go downhill as two different servers took over.We ordered two sharing plates between three people as appetizers. The flavours were fantastic and serving sizes were very generous. One plate would have been sufficient. Midway through our appetizers after 10mins, the new waitress tried to deliver our main courses. We asked her to give us more time to finish our first course but she tried to leave the main course (lamb shank) on the table. We had to insist she take it back to the kitchen to keep it warm.After that the service got worse and worse. Nobody refilled our water glasses or checked if we needed anything. We had to wait a long time to attract the attention of the waitress to clear our dishes and bring the next course or refresh our wine. She was sitting at the back of the restaurant eating her lunch and the other staff were leaning on the wall of the kitchen looking at their phones the whole time.The main courses were tasty and generous but the bad service ruined our enjoyment. We got the impression that perhaps the regular staff were on holiday and they had invited untrained family or friends to cover for them. Who knows. Surely it can't be this bad normally judging by the other reviews.Sadly, we won't be back. The food is good but the noise and the poor service make it impossible to have a relaxing lunch
5
Impeccable service! The staff were very accommodating to all of our requests, and they did it all with a great smile!
Their signature laksa is one too big a bowl for one! Jam packed of ingredients and flavor! Yums!
4
The service was warm and attentive and the food was delicious!
Enjoyed the cocktails the most and the ambience was lovely.
5
It had been a great experience! Service is great! Food is Great! Ambience is great!
Only problem is parking.
5
Love the ambience and food. Will definitely be returning! Staff was friendly and service was excellent.
4
The ambience was quite alright with the right amount of scented air. However, in consideration with the talking from the crowd and the background music, it sounded quite messy. Had thei signature durian cake, chendol cake and the quenching longan tea.Both cakes were just about right, though it could have been better if the texture was improved perhaps by being a tad bit more moist. Durian cake did live up to its name with just about the right amount of durian paste making it not overtly unpleasantly rich, but the chendol cake was a disappointment. There wasn't any taste of Gula Melaka which chendol was famous for. However, it was surprising how the jelly and attap seed was incorporated into the cake.The drink was the saviour for both the cakes, not too sweet but as what the menu mentioned, it was truly a quencher.Thumbs up for creativity. Would definitely come again to try its main courses.
5
How many times do you feel that you need to have the stomach of a cow? Come to Creatures. I haven't had that feeling for a really long time and this restaurant managed to intrigue me with all the dishes that other tables have ordered and my little stomach can't absorb. Definitely a keeper. Intimate setting and friendly staff
3
The restaurant has a great ambience, perfect for the chillaxing lunch we had. Love the decoration and setup. The food was well executed and very tasty but a bit overpriced for the type of dishes served. I came here primarily to try the durian cake that I've heard so much about. The cake was good but not exceptional. There was a generous portion of fresh durian in the cake but the pandan sponge layers were a tad dry. Nonetheless, it was overall an enjoyable meal
4
Visited this place which serves Asian fusion food as a group of 6. The place is not big so decided to call the night in advance to reserve a table and also 3 slices of durian cakes as was told its better to reserve the signature durian cake in advance.The ambience of this restaurant is good and the food is unique. The ah ma noodles is pretty nice, so are the roast duck salad and truffle fries. The prata dish has a unique taste.Ordered an orh nee cake on the spot. Its nice but not special. Best to eat this before the durian cake which has a stronger taste.The durian cakes are absolutely heavenly with real durian fresh in it. A must try and best to call and reserve it in advance

Came here for dinner with frens but personally find that the food here is kind of over-rated! Tried the undermention dish,1. ikan bilis Caesar (very average)2. roasted Duck with pear (not bad. Recommendable)3. creatures laksa (gravy is nice, but when mixed everything together, the overall taste changes. A bit bland, not enough gravy too. Not recommended)4. Miso cod with rice balls (Didnt like it. Only the rice balls are nice. The cod is very bland and cant taste miso. Not worth the money spend. Not recommendable)5. Prawn and minced pork buah keluar on prata (way too saltish. The prata is very soggy. Poorly prepared. The coconut milk superceded the taste of buah keluar! Pitiful)6. Orh Nee cake (nice with some chunky yam pieces. Very light cake which worth the stomach space)7. Cendol cake (cant taste the favour of the sponge cake as the fillings are too overwhelming. The fillings are kind of too sweet until you cant feel the rest of the items.)8. Durian Cake (like the rest of the cakes, the fillings are too overwhelming until it covers the entire taste of the cakes overall. The filling taste not too bad, but its definitely not one of the good ones that i have tried.)Though food wise quite average with not much recommendation, but i must say the ambience is quite nice. Nicely decorated. A room filled with lemongrass aroma. For lovers of lemongrass, should not miss
3
We heard so much about the cakes that we decided to give it a try. We ordered a few appetizers to share, the fries with asian spices was a little disappointing with the fries not crispy enough and the asian seasoning is nothing more than just paprika powder. Some of the mains are hits and misses for us, the spicy prawn pasta is a winner among us. Th highlights are definitely the cakes which they are most known for! The location is not the most convenient but the surrounding area is definitely interesting to explore after your meal.
2
Staff were very friendly but our drink order didn't come though we reminded them. Laksa came lukewarm. Asian spice fries was so-so
5
The kong Bak bun, duck and pear salad and durian cake were good. Signature Laksa is a bit too heavy. Overall, food is not considered cheap but good quality.
5
I'm a true blue peranakan and am really not into fusion - but I really enjoyed the food and service in Creatures!
4
Ordered the unique mango sticky rice tea, special "Cheong Fun" appetiser (deconstructed chee cheong fun with meat), white clam vongolle and their famed durian cake.
3
Nice decor with limitation space, offer creative asian fusion cuisine. Some of the dishes are slightly different than expected.
Must try the durian cake, the sponge cake was nice and soft when sandwiched between the luscious durian cream, it is nice!
5
Food was fantastic. Loved that they checked if we required recommendations and took the time to explain the dishes. Service is excellent. Highly recommended!
5
Went to the restaurant because my friend wanted to try the durian cake.It was a Tuesday and was quite packed. Loved the ambience of the restaurant and service was good.We enjoyed the drinks and the food - cheong fun revolution, salad, broth of hae and the best braised meat bun. The desserts paled in comparison.We liked the food so much that we went back within the same week on a Friday so that we can try the signature laksa - it was yummy too.Be expected to pay abt SGD$50 if you order appetizer to share, main course, drinks and desserts. But it was.money well spent as we really enjoyed the food.and the ambienc

Went for dinner at CreatureS with my wife on a Thursday evening. Ambience of the place was lovely though it got a little noisy when the full crowd came in.Service was superb. However, the food was a tad disappointing in that it didn't really live up to the hype. Having said that, all in the food was good.The two soups (the prawn & the pumpkin) were excellent. The duck salad was a wonderful suggestion by the wait staff. The Kong Bak Pau was nice but the sauce a tad too oily. Best thing of this dish was the accompanying sambal.Our biggest let down was the mains. The Granpa Chicken and Grandma Noodles (or the other way around) was nice, especially the noodles (which unfortunately was tad oily) which had a great flavour. The chicken was juicy but the it didn't taste special. Huge piece though.The curry chicken was good but nothing special. Probably cos it lacked punchOne little thing, mains were served separately which kinda left us with the if-i-don't-eat-now-it-will-get-cold-but-my-wife's-dish-hasn't-come-yet-so-how situationThe durian cake was nice but again, we kinda expected more after all the hoo-ha.So in short, it was a nice meal but didn't live up to the hype. But it more than made up for it with a nice ambience and really attentive and friendly wait staf
5
I must say I've been rather jaded by the slew of new restaurants which are overhyped And under deliver in terms of their ability to surprise you in a positive manner especially for the food.Creatures did just that. Not only did I love what I chose, I find myself constantly looking across the room to see the various dishes I had wanted to try but have no room for them. I'LL BE BACK.... and this time with a cow stomach.Please keep it up and hopefully it will not close due to lack of traffic
5
Love the beautiful deco of this restaurant - nice and homely. Lots of flowers and lemongrass fragrance in the air. Staff are friendly and know the dishes very well. Able to make recommendations based on your cravings :)As we are a large group of hungry eaters, we ordered a variety of starters, mains and cakes; not forgetting their list of beverages - all very good and yummy! Nice place to celebrate any special occasions and will definitely go back again for more yummy food
4
Nice ambience, lovely polite and helpful staff. Location not very near to any mrt, got to drive or take a bus. Food was good, but a little more expensive than expected.
4
Service staff are knowledgable about the menu and the food/restaurant concept. Generally very attentive to the customer and accommodating. Food was a refreshing change to the usual eggs/coffee brunch venues. Portions were so generous, overall food was delicious.
4
Very nice ambient with the smell of lemongrass which is not too strong but kind of enough for relaxing mood. Food is nice and fresh. Taste is no doubt good and actually beyond expectation. The service is good and staff is very calm and attentive.
5
Went there for the Orh Nee and Durian cake recently. Place was a little inconvenient if you're taking public transport, otherwise the food/service/ambience of the place were all on point!
4
Since my bff want Peranakan for her birthday treat, we decided to try out Creatures which received many good reviews. It was definitely a good choice - from the warm service to cafe ambiance to food. We had 2 sharings - Kong Bak Bao, Ngoh Hiang & Cuttlefish Kueh Pie Ti and Laksa which were all good
4
Made a booking with CreatureS at 1pm, was held up arrived late 15mins, but they still served my reservation Ordered the lunch set which menu and selection of mains were designed in a refreshing tone. Each was $28++ and had the option of topping up the difference if you wanted something else on the menu.Loved the atmosphere, gentle and calming for senses. Sight of the gentle lighting, smell of wonder aroma even in the washroom, taste of flavourful dishes, hearing of a relaxing music at the back, and the touch of sleek utensils and furniture

The restaurant has very beautiful and interesting decor, we were seated upstairs. Staff are super friendly and funny!My friends and I were celebrating a farewell and we enjoyed most of our dishes. The best dish had to be the ngoh hiang and as per other reviews the sambal chilli is absolutely yummy. The noodles in the Ah Kong Ah Mah dish was very fragrant and nice to eat. Miso cod lovely but the ulam onigiri did not give the effect that I was looking for i.e. the ulam(herbs) could not be tasted so was a tad disappointed. The pongteh was not melt in the mouth, the pork belly was a little tough to cut up. The durian cake is the highlight of the meal, filled with chunks of durian flesh. The lemon cake was also very good. I will be returning to try out other dishes

CreatureS serve up delectable fusion cuisine which makes one wanting to return. It's conveniently located in Jalan Besar, just 10min walk from farrer park mrt station, across the road from Swee Choon Tim Sum.I've visited CreatureS 4 times and apart from trying different dishes, some staples always remain. The truffle fries are fragrant and tasty and even after leaving it for an hour (as we tuck in to our mains), they remained crispy. The Mao Shan Wang durian cake is another must and due to limited quantity, do reserve ahead to avoid disappointment.In my most recent visit, I tried their miso cod and fell in love with it instantly. It simply melts in my mouth! Other dishes that I'll recommend includes their prawn bisque, lychee martini cake and lychee ice cream

there is nothing not to like about this place... when you step into the restaurant, it transforms you to a quaint part of Europe. the service staff are very responsive and knowledgeable. I find myself very piqued by all dishes ordered by other table and I really like my Codfish dish. it was interesting to see that no table ordered their very good value-for-money lunch which is a testament to how good their food is and people are willing to pay full price instead of going to other places that provide that. And the entire restaurant is full

Well decorated restaurant with friendly staff and good food. Salad was appetizing. Mains were good too!

1) Ngoh Hiang & Cuttlefish Kueh Pie Tie, S$24Lovely presentation of the homemade pork and prawn roll and cuttlefish keuh pie tie. The sambal chilli is a killer!!2) Miso Cod & Ulam Onigiri, S$32The savory over-roasted fish was succulent but the belachan assam herb rice balls doesn't seem to compliment well. Accompanied by refreshing cucumber salad in plum sauce and lime juice dressing.3) Creatures Laksa, $24(available only on Friday Dinner, Full Day on Sat, Sun and PH)Generous ingredients (fresh prawns, quail eggs, chicken, fish cakes and cucumber laces) that make the value worth. The flaming sunset bowl of thick broth offers a distinctive dried shrimp and rich coconut milk and spice. The amazingly tasty quintessential nonya laksa will tickle the tastebuds and leave you wanting for more. Served with al dente thick vermicelli and yellow noodles.4) Ah Gong Fried Chicken & Ah Ma noodles, $22Ah Ma Noodles were perfect texture and QQ. Tossed in aromatic shallot and light soy. So simple yet comforting.Ah Gong fried chicken leg is crisp with juicy tender meat under the crust. However the garam masala needs more kick. Good on its own without the chinchalok mayonnaise.5) Durian Cake, $12The Chantilly cream-frosted pandan genoise sponge cake is not only a velvety beauty. The layered thick Mao Shan Wang durian paste and clumps of the pungent fruit’s flesh is also divine. We licked clean within minutes

This is my second visit. Was impressed with the main, ah gong friedchicken and ah ma noodles and dessert, durian and orh née cake during my first visit sometime early April. Tonight, I am there to celebrate Mother's Day in advance. Sad to say this is a total disappointment.The only main that remained the same standard is the chicken noodle. Duck and pear salad is just so so, as recommended by the staff. Truffle fries is good though. Lamb shank only taste of rendang gravy and covered the origin. Zhu burger taste very 'zhu'. Miso Cod fish taste very 'fishy' and the onigiri has a very strong herb taste. Ngoh hiang and kueh pie tie are very oily and salty. Vongole chowder is also very 'fishy' and the chowder that claimed to be 'rich' is also too cheesy. Clams were not washed properly with sands in it. Their signature durian cake and orh nee cake are still good but the rainbow cheese cake are too overwhelmed by the taste of colorings. I don't think I will visit this place for mains, perhaps only cakes but very pricy at $12 with gst per piece. With the total bill of $350, I would likely be getting better food else where

I had been here with two BFFs mainly for the durian cake rather for food but since we are here already...why not?For the food we had duck & pear salad (dressing with pear slices were superb! But duck meat so-so), cod with miso + rice balls (very innovative dish - not bad), kueh pie tee with ngo hiang (BEST dish of our meal with the super spicy samba chilli... We could have order another batch!) & lastly the homemade noodles with fried chicken (noodles were awesome! Very Q & very nice even on its own with no seasoning or sauce! Thumbs down for the fried chicken as it's too oily + texture dry & tough + too much batter ...If we guessed correctly it's made from frozen chicken meat, ll I can say is, I had tasted much better fried chicken made frozen meat. If they don't improve the quality of the chicken in terms of cooking & seasoning, I will just order the noodles alone for this dish...seriously!)Finally. ..The long awaiting durian cake...It did not disappoint us but we wished there were abit more durian in it based on the price it's charged bit anyway...it's delicious. ..deserved to have an encore! We also tried the Orh Nee cake...not bad but the Orh Nee can be a bit more smooth to make perfect to us.The service was good especially from the young chap with specs from the 2nd level of the cafe (he tried so hard to sell the popular dishes to us & he won!). However, the embiance we felt was slightly put off by the wilting flowers at the 2nd level....what a pity...The owners should pay attention to such small but important details...We really want such local cafes to be as perfect as possible because we are really proud of them for their passion in this business & to last!Will we be back again? Maybe...as it's a bit pricey, not yet to the 'worth-the-price' standard yet & we do hope they take customers' feedback more seriously to fine tune some negative comments on the cafe in order to 'grow' & to sustain

The ambiance of the place is really nice and romantic. The food was great especially the laska and Durian Cake (of course). However, please be warned that the serving can be quite big, so sharing is advisable. The service is excellent as well! Overall pleasant visit but the food was pretty expensive

Lovely truffle fries strongly recommended for sharing! Kong bah Bao not nice when it's cold so must eat fast. Same goes for the weekend laksa where the gravy dries up very fast. Miso cod is very worth it though ah gong ah ma noodles is chewy like spaghetti. Prefers to sit at level 1 Aircon area as level 2 has a jasmine smell.Toilets are well maintained and overall attractive place with reasonable-priced wine ($50/bottle of white wine), too bad not chilled. Staff are great and Would visit there again for celebrations or special occasions. Remember to reserve! 10mins walk from farrer park Mrt.

Creatures restaurant is in a shop house. The place is pretty nice with a nice atmosphere.Food wise, this is fine but not particularly impressive. We tried 4 or 5 of their Peranakan inspired dishes. Nothing was wrong but at the same time nothing stood up. Only one that was particularly tasty was the small eggs you can order for starters.Price wise, it is not overpriced but not cheap at the same time. I wouldn t specifically go back but it wasn't a bad experience. Average

What an amazing experience at CreatureS. I happened to hear about this place and went ahead and looked at their website. I had a good feeling I would enjoy visiting, so Cristina and I decided to take a metro to Creature’s spot. As we walked past, I was hoping to not miss it, but quickly noticed the cool door and rosemary herbs growing in front of the window. I then looked at the sign and seen “CreatureS.” We walked into the restaurant and immediately greeted by the waitress, then shown to a table. I already knew what I wanted, so I quickly ordered a bottle of wine, which was reasonable in price compared to other in the city. I then ordered an appetizer of Asian fries, which were thin potato fries served with kaffir lime mayonnaise and we devoured these. As a main course we ordered the Ah Gong fried chicken and Ah Ma noodles which is a crispy leg of chicken dipped in a garam masala crust, and served with chinchalok mayonnaise and la-mein tossed in shallot and light soy. We also ordered the Zhu burger, which is a pork patty marinated with Xo congna. Amazing!!! As desert we shared a scoop of lemongrass & ginger ice cream. I must say, visiting this place made be fall in love with Singapore. I know I am coming back again and bringing some friends with me too

Nice atmosphere. Limited space but u still get privacy. Staffs r all polite and friendly but service abit slow. And need reminders.The main course all $20 and above. Not many choices and taste soso. However their dessert are superb. We ordered their signature durian cake and rainbow cheese cake. Very nice!!!we love it. We will come bc again for their dessert.

Lovely place to dine in and tasty food..almost all from main dish to dessert to drinks are good. Except cost abit high for main course n if u don't have a transport, need to walk abit in.

The food is definitely fusion, eg Lamb Shank with rendang sauce. The restaurant have a very nice cozy setting and the service is exceptionally good.
3
Nice place, but a bit difficult to find parking space.
We ordered Laksa, Kong Bak Pau and fired chicken noodle.
Good service but a bit expensive average $20-30 for a dish.

From the "Sharing" portion of the menu, we ordered the Ngoh Hiang & Cuttlefish Kueh Pie Tie. Basically, two medium sized pork & prawn spring rolls, cut in half, and a small pastry puff with radishes and cuttlefish. Interesting flavors, but rather small portions especially for sharing and, we thought, way overpriced at S$24++ (total bill S$28.25). Located on Desker, a short block and half off of Syed Alwi, through not the greatest neighborhood. Pleasant and relaxing ambiance once inside. Tasty water, infused with cantaloupe & melon, with mint leaves. Pleasant enough service. Doubt that we will go back

My friend brought me to this restaurant which hide in the neighborhood with a view of the flat from the window. The restaurant was almost full for lunch. We had the set lunch which was $28+++. However, the alacart price was expensive. One main dish between $20-$28. Food was average and a bit pricey. Ambience is quite nice but will be very noisy if full house.
3
It looks really good on the website but I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the food and the service. The staff are polite but we ordered and there seemed to be three shifts in providing the food. I have the noodles and chicken and the chicken was burnt. The desserts were OK though.

Bunch of girlfriends decided to try this place and we ordered buah keluak on Prata, kueh Pei tee n Ngor Hiang as appetisers. For main we ordered miso cod, lamb shank, grandparents chicken n la mien. The cod was average (tad too sweet for my liking) but the rice balls were nice n refreshing (a little like baba nasi ulam - rice with herbs) the la mien was very nice but the fried chicken so so. Which makes me wonder why the main stars are lacking n the sides are better tasting. The lamb shank curry was very nice but the lamb shank abit tough for my liking. For desserts we had the durian cake, Orh nee (yam ) cake and the chocolate cake. We all found the Orh nee cake very good. The chocolate cake with coconut ice cream was rather yummy too. The main star MSW durian cake was below our expectations. The cocktails on the other hand was quite yummy. We had lemongrass Martini, lychee sorbee martini and a passionfruit one. Very yummy. Might go back to try the rest of the dishes as the service staff were very pleasan

Housed in a 2-storey conserved shop house, CreatureS has a nondescript and monochrome facade that literally bursts into colours once you step inside - from the eyecatchingly huge floral centerpiece composed of fresh flowers that are replaced and arranged weekly, to the oriental-inspired floral murals on the walls handpainted by a local artist, and the exquisite culinary selections specially planned and crafted by the owners...The offerings are mainly Asian-inspired, specifically Peranakan (also known as nonya and Straits Chinese), but with a modern and contemporary touch, creating an interesting east-meets-west experience for the palette.If you are unsure of the menu items to try, feel free to ask the servers for suggestions and recommendations. The personal and attentive service is another hallmark of this cafe, with the personable and enthusiastic service, kitchen, and bar teams personally helmed by the owners themselves, who are often serving customers and helping out both in the dining area and the kitchen.Here's also a reminder to save room for the wonderful and unique desserts offered in the menu. Especially of note are the various types of cakes, which the owners used to sell full-time prior to the setting up of CreatureS. It will be a full circle when a dedicated cakes/dessert shop gets set-up (hopefully soon)

Two floors in the restaurant with gorgeous artwork on the walls..the smell of lemongrass permeates in the air. One of the many dishes you have to try is the "kong bak" which is braised pork in black sauce. Mantou or chinese buns are provided to stuff the pork inside. Sweet, savory & tender pork accompanied by quail eggs. Service at the restaurant is very good. Staff is attentive and you can see the owner moving from one table to the next to check that customers are well taken care of. With good food and great service, it is a must visit. Reservations are recommended

I visited the restaurant with my partner on the 8th JAN for dinner. People (Service): 1. Service was very good, despite some of the negative feedback i have heard. I was seated on the 2nd level and the 2 servers (A young Chinese lady and an Indian gentlemen was prompt and friendly with the service. A young Chinese chap who came up to help later was also very warm despite being a little nervous as he is probably new on the job. Thumbs up for all 3 of them). 2. The host however could use a little more smile and when walking the guests up to the 2nd floor, please take it slow. I am not as young, fit and healthy as you. As a host, he/she is the first point of contact and even if you are not that friendly, do be considerate towards your guests. 3. The restaurant is a little dark, and i am not sure if all the service staff had name tags on. But i can't seem to remember their names and i always feel that it will be a good thing to give the staff a name tag, so that the good ones could be properly recognized. Product (Food & Beverage Offerings)1. Menu was impressive. I can see all the thought put into it. The range of offerings and the choice of ingredients were on point. 2. The best dish that i had was the Watermelon & Feta Salad. It is refreshing, it was well balanced and it is a must to order!3. Asian Style Vongole tasted great too! Could consider having some bread rolls to go along with is just so we can soak up the tasty sauce. Pricing was a little steep for the portion. 4. Kong Bak Pau was very good too! Portion was good enough for 4 people! We were again hoping that there were more buns, Perhaps 6 to 8 of it. The portion of meat were generous. Worth a try!5. MisoCod with Onigiri is worth a try if you like cod. One of the better cod dishes i have tasted. The Cod was really the highlight and the onigiri went very well with it. 6. Chicken Noodle was disappointing. The Chicken was Deep fried and probably a little over fried. Even with limited lighting, i could tell that it was a little burnt. The noodle was good but could use a little more sauce. Out of the 6 dishes that we ordered, this would have ranked last.7. The Durian cake was light and well balanced. Definitely a signature. Wish i had more space for the other cakes which looked equally good! Desserts is probably one of their fortes. 8. Wish there were more choices of beer and cocktails. The house wine (White) was terrible. Although it is table wine, i am sure we can get better ones that will go better with the food. The wine was ruining the taste and please reconsider the So. Blanc Airen.Place (Ambience):1. I love the choice of scent, Lemon grass. However do go easy on the scent at the dining area as i would like to smell the aroma of the food when it is served without having it mixed with Lemongrass scent. The amount of scent used in the dining area is suitable for the washrooms. 2. I would like to stay a little longer at the cafe but the seats weren't the most comfortable. Perhaps some cushion? Process:1. The Service Cycle with a guest often starts at the point of reservation even before the guest steps into the outlet. Imagine my horror when the call was answered with "Hello". I almost wanted to reply with "It's Me". This showed the lack of training and professionalism in guest services. It really did turn me off for a bit and i was wondering if i should still have dinner at Creatures. Do get the basic standard verbiage right.Overall, this is still a relatively new place and it has great potential in becoming a signature/chain cafe in Singapore. I only give 5 star reviews to places that i would like to re-visit again and Creature does it for me. (Mainly because of the menu choices, good service and ambiance)Certainly hope that the above feedback could be taken constructively for improvement
