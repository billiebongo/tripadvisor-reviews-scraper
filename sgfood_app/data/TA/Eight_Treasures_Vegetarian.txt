We love it here. We've never been disappointed - friendly staff, great options for veggies and good portion sizes.

Nice spread of Chinese Vegetarian food. Service is quick and the staff is friendly. Do give the satay a try. Reasonably priced as well. Close to the China town tourist strip so after shopping for souvenirs its a good spot for dinner
5
The menu seemed to mainly catered towards big groups for dish-sharing, so if you're traveling solo, you'll probably end up ordering the smaller and plain dishes, like fried rice. They place nice and calming Buddhist music here.

Situated beside the famous Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, this restaurant serves pretty good vegetarian dishes. Price wise can be a little pricey though but on the whole, pretty good experience. Will visit again.

My wife and I visited this restaurant yesterday. It appears to be a small family run restaurant upstairs over a day time café. The staff were friendly and helpful. The bean curd satay that my wife had was in-impressive, it was more coating than bean curd. We choose a seemingly vegetarian rice option and was disappointed to find that the rice was comprehensively mixed with miniature pieces of meat making it very difficult to fish out the meat in fact my wife gave up in the end. This is a non licenced restaurant. Nice setting on the edge of Chinatown looking out on the museum
3
I went there with the hope that I could get a healthy, fresh, unprocessed vegetarian menu. I was dissapointed as most of the menu offered there consisted of mock meat. I ordered their 'pork' honey bbq out of curiosity and the local spinach soup. Both menu tasted really nice actually :)I wished that the 'meat' used tempeh / mushroom instead of processed food
5
Was recommended this restaurant by a friend, on the corner of Chinatown only a 5-6 minute walk from ChinaTown MRT, we went mid week for dinner and was full throughout the evening so would recommend that you book in advance not to be disappointed. The restaurant was over 3 floors with the ground floor being vegan and the the remaining floors being vegetarian. The taste and blends of spices and ingredients was absolutely superb across the whole menu... I would have to say that it maybe one of the best vegetarian restaurants i have been to.... we were in a group of 4 so all choose items off the menu and shared them... I do love eating meat as part of my diet however would more than happily return to this restaurant on a regular basis... In respect of those who do not like spicy food you can request that they make the food less spicy when ordering
2
The appetizer of lotus root fried was heavy with the batter and one hardly tasted the vegetable...the manager later said they eat it for the batter..btw, the upstairs is for large families so they seat you down below in another vegetarian place called well-dressed which is under the same management..My entree of eggplant with sesame had a smell which I did not eat. The manager said they like to make their food taste just like it would if you are meat and hence, all the mock meat and fermentation...Anywhere else they wouldn't charge you for an entree you didn't eat, not in Singapore. He said he will give me a 20% discount as if that was a huge favor...To his credit, he did ask me if I wanted to try something else but once bitten ...
5
Definitely not "just" a vegetarian restaurant--the food was magnificent from a non-vegetarian perspective as well!!If you or someone you know believes vegetarian food is boring or lacks variety or whatever, a visit to Eight Treasures will forever silence your/their misgivings. If you travel to Singapore and only have one meal, make it here . . . one of Chinatown's true gems
5
The restaurant is located pretty centrally in Chinatown, it's no frills in terms of decor and the service could probably be improved... But the food is actually really, really good! We ordered sweet and sour 'pork', salt and pepper 'chicken' and a chili 'chicken' dish and all tasted amazing! Unlike other reviews I found the price very reasonable too... I visited on my last night in Singapore but wish I'd found it sooner, essential for veggies visiting the city

態度差勁！
沒禮貌！
食物失水準！
Not willing to pay for it for this kind of service better choose foodcourt cheap and nice!
5
First time here, I was amazed by their quick service located in Chinatown. Small space but the ambience is very nice. Food tasted very good. Dint realize that eating vegetarian in Singapore is that tasty. Would love to go back soon.
5
Great food, vegetarian but very Chinese, a lot made with mock meat. We love it! There are a lot of options in this area but Eight Treasures is definitely worth a try!
Promise the meat lovers will not miss meat or fish at all.
4
Glad to find a chinese cusine vegiee restaurant in Singapore .....njoyed every bit of the authentic tasty food they served .
5
I been here 3 times when I'm visit Singapore. Food are so nice and staff are so good.If you are vegan or love to try a new menu I recommended
1
First time encounter such horrible services which I bring my business partner to try this restaurant. I felt REALLY embarrassing to bring my business partner here. First, I don't mind that they have no welcome us when we enter to the restaurant(at 2:50pm which is after lunch time and there was not crowded). I requested from the service staff I need a table for 5 people, so the staff bring us to the table(the table is for 6-8). After that we took the seat and check with the menu and when we decided what to order for our meal, I raised my hand and call the service staff, and the staff came and question us did we only have 5 people, I said YES, then the staff then asked us move to corner smaller table that just for 5people WITHOUT any apology. After we finished our food, the service staff clearing the plates and accidentally pushed down my tea and split(it's actually is like pouring because there full cup of tea) all over my Bermuda. The first reaction wasn't the staff apology and help me to get dry of my bermuda, the staff went to take the mop and asked me to move out of my chair and mop the tea on the floor. Another ridiculous action from the counter staff when I pay the bill, I calmly asked the counter staff is there any hairdryer to dry off my bermuda, the staff immediately flip her eyes to said NO. It's really disappointed to the their service.I definitely won't recommend any of my friends or business partner to this restaurant FOREVER.

Eight Treasures Vegetarian is a great restaurant that serves unique dishes that are wholesome,delicious and wonderfully thought out. Not your typical vegetarian restaurant where everything is either bland, MSG flavoured or substituted with gluten. Kudos to the chef and his team who created a wide range of delicious choices paring vegetables and non meat ingredients to offer memorable dishes good for the palate ,kind to the health and smooth the soul!!! I have been to this restaurant 3 times and it never fails to deliver. Good attentive service too .......
5
This is one of the best Asian mock-meat vegetarian restaurants I have been to, suitable for both family and business meals. The extensive menu has photos so you can see what you're getting, and there is so much to choose from across Asian food - like Chinese, Malay, Thai, and Singaporean dishes. We had the nyonya fish, which came in a delightful lemongrass curry; the tender beef curry, the monkey head mushrooms that tasted just like meat (closest to beef), and the lemon duck. The prices are very reasonable, the service is quick, the decor is lovely and tasteful, and the table layout and seating is comfortable. Highly recommended
5
I found this brilliant place via Tripadvisor. It's all the good things that the reviews say about it. I am vegetarian but The Husband is not and so I was a little concerned that he wouldn't be happy. But he absolutely loved his food as much as I did mine. If you want somewhere to eat that has no frills but terrific local atmosphere, then this is for you. Even if you are a meat/fish eater you'll find dishes here that you will really enjoy
5
In a very convenient place with many options to choose from. Perfect vegetarian, vegan option and also if you are looking for something than deep fried and heavy stuff. Fast, fresh and friendly place. Prices are good. Seem to have lots of dessert options. Check opening times ;
2
Not up my street . Was expecting fresh vegetarian food , got lumped with a lot of 'mock meat' options .
Don't quite understand why a vegan / vegetarian will be crazy about mock meats ?
2
chinese place was closed. sat in the westernised portion of the hotel, very mediocore ambeince, and average food, very small portion but pricey
3
White linen, Chinese vegetarian food f a high quality but overpriced to the maximum. I had a quality vegetarian dinner in Temple Street for $4 compared with $25 albeit without the cleanliness and pristine linen of this lovely place
4
Right in the heart of China Town overlooking to Buddha Tooth Relic Temple this restaurant had a good choice of really tasty vegetarian dishes. Would certainly recommend it.
4
We enjoyed this meal! My vegetarian fiancé said it was the best food he had eaten in a while. First, when you walk in, be sure to find the staircase and go to the 2nd floor (the first floor is a different restaurant). They have air conditioning, and it wasn't set too cold, it was just right. The ladies were pretty nice (we did laugh when our server told my fiancé he couldn't have sugar for his hot tea because it's not good for the body...she was totally serious). The menu was very extensive and we loved that they would tell you a name of a dish, then give you a description of how they make it. So, you would know that the inside of some piece of mock meat was tofu or veggies or mashed potatoes, and what it would be coated in (like a crunchy fried coating or a fried tofu skin). It's worth noting that all of the "meats" are vegetarian, so you can't accidentally order something with meat or fish. We ate the Peking duck, the BBQ pork ribs, and the sweet and sour pork. My favorite was the BBQ ribs, which were so yummy with some rice. The Peking duck was tasty, but nothing like real duck. They served it with lettuce to put it in and sweet chili sauce. The sweet and sour pork wasn't too sweet, it was nicely flavored. The meat nuggets were perfectly fried and not too firm like some we've tried at other places. We were very happy, and would definitely come back next time we are in Singapore
5
Eight treasures was a great find in Chinatown. The brunch set (veggie sausage mushroom, vegan feta, and, avocado with focaccia) was awesome and I would recommend it! Each part was delicious and I was able to sub potatoes for the mushrooms. One tip, if you order the fresh green apple juice, ask them NOT to add salt to it. They add the salt to preserve the colour but drinking salty juice just isn't worth the aesthetics in my opinion. I found it to be insipid. Yes, the juice will turn brown with exposure to the air (like any apple would), but just drink it quickly if there is any concern. The staff were really nice and they remade the drink for me without the salt. I also recommend the vanilla bean cake (it either has rose or lavender but I can't remember). It was a great dessert to end off the meal.
3
Don't be misguided looking at the menu. I was standing peeping into menu in front of the hotel and every menu item said chicken, pork ribs, shark fins etc. I was in dual minds before stepping in and still made the courage to get in to figure it out. What I realised is they mimick those tastes through vegetarian items like soya, bean curds etc While it was worth the try for my Wife who is a pure vegetarian to realise how the chicken tastes and the taste profiles of a Chinese cuisine in its truest form, we didn't enjoy the taste to our best. The portions sizes are small. The service and ambience is just average too.
5
We loved this restaurant because it joins chinese food together with a very healthy point of view of the staff. I am celiac (gluten-free option) and they really take care of the customer in every detail. The courses are very traditional and very well elaborated. Apart from food they count with a very wide variety of desserts
5
No white linen, service ok. The food is really good with, from what I can tell, fresh ingredients. In particular, we enjoyed the rice noodle and beancurd dishes. Small portions are of decent size and allow you to enjoy a bit more variety (3 small plates was enough for our dinner for two)
5
I went for lunch with friends and although we had a reservation, it really wasn't necessary, since the restaurant doesn't get full during the week. Parking is very convenient at the parking lot of the nearby Relic Tooth Buddhist Temple. The service is very fast, the food is surprisingly varied, with options that look and taste like pork and chicken. There are 3 portion sizes, so it's very practical for any size party. The prices are affordable and the food is very tasty. I totally recommend this restaurant for anyone, not only vegetarians
4
If not for my mom who is a vegetarian, would not have stepped into such an establishment but what a discovery it was. The food was more than good and the staff friendly but it burnt a hole in our pocket!
5
Located next to Buddha tooth temple at level two, ask the waiters (english/chinese) to recommend some hand made specialities. Yummy!
4
Just returned from Singapore found a gem on a place in Chinatown (next to Budda Tooth Relic Temple) for ice cold draught Tiger beer, cheapest beer in Chinatown price also includes GST. You can sit outside and watch the world go by. Enjoy
4
Ordered the eight treasures vegetable dish (recommended), which was a very tasty tofu dish with spinach and a unique black sauce. The honey lemon chicken was also great.
5
Eight Treasures serves Vegan food in authentic Chinese flavours.The dishes range from chicken, lamb, pork, beef to even more exotic sea food preparation. However, the twist is that all this is done without any meat. They have mastered the art of making tasty mock food using soy and other ingredients. Their motto is meat less does not mean taste less
5
Unexpectedly delicious vegetarian food ! The upstairs floor is comfortable with a nice view across Sago Street towards the Buddha Tooth temple. The Pumpkin & Prawns veggie dish was really nice. The service was friendly. The ambience was quite fun with a smattering of buddhist nuns on the day we were there. Altogether quite pleasant experience
5
We stumbled on this lovely little restaurant after walking through Food Street. It was hot and we all were dying for a nice fresh salad. I had the Green Goddess and it was delicious and my companions had wraps. The fresh fruit drinks were excellent. I can highly recommend this restaurant
4
We dined at Eight Treasures twice during our recent stay in Singapore. The restaurant is on the corner of Sago Road and South Bridge Street and is upstairs. The first time we reserved a table as there were 6 of us, the second we simply turned up and there was space. The restaurant is quite busy especially early in the evening and it closes quite early (around 9.30pm). We arrived at 7.30pm at it was already busy - mostly young oriental clientele.The food is all vegetarian and the restaurant prides itself as being authentic (although how a strict vegetarian would know about the authenticity escapes me). The menu is clear and denotes levels of spicyness. If you are not into spicy food then don't choose the spicy dish (or as my brother did the spicy soup). We had a soup (shark's fin and noodles) as starter followed by a choice of main dishes washed down with some Chinese tea and coke zero. We were very happy and decided to go again before we came home. We had a good full meal (starter and main course) and this cost us around Â£50 for two people - as I said not cheap but the food was tasty and the portions plentiful. We followed this by a leisurely walk back to our hotel (approx. 3 miles) through the city and along the bay front. The perfect way to end a perfect day in Singapore
4
It looked a small restaurant on the ground floor but we went upto the 1st floor better air con! And it's actually 3 floors. It was very busy and everything on menu is vegetarian so cheered my friend up! For a lunch two small dishes and small rice is more than enough and the honey "chicken" was tasty! In the area and vegetarian? then there isn't really anywhere else you should bother looking and it's almost next to Buddha tooth templ
4
Being in Singapore around the Chinese New Year means a MUST visit to China Town and of course a hearty meal at Eight Treasures catering purely to vegeterians like us! Quite naturally we started off with the traditional Yusheng or Prosperity Toss, doing the ' Lohei' toss with full gusto!! This was followed up with Olive Fried Rice, Mouthwatering Tofu vegetable & Spinach Soup with Jasmine Tea as accompaniment right through. For dessert we had Mango Pudding ice cold. Can you imagine a heartier meal than this? The broadly smiling Chinese host guided us all the way, presenting us two fresh oranges for good luck on CNY! We are surely coming back and not waiting for the next CNY for that!
5
Just had a lunch gathering with my friends at this restaurant. The food is delicious but it is a bit too expensive. The staff have a habit of repeated asking diners to consider ordering deserts.
5
Fine vegetarian meal. A bit high price but yummy!
Let your veg meal be colorful and vary.
Over 100 of veg menus with luxury dish like The monk jump over the wall,.....yes Veg!
Come here almost every time visitting Singapore.
4
Clean and variety. Located near bus stop. Nice service. But do not like that the vegetarian restaurant related too much with religious.
5
This is an excellent place for vegetarians and those who would like to see how "Mock" veggie food can be..the have veggie chicken, ribs, pork, duck and fish...all done to perfection, you almost wouldn't realize that it's not meat. Very friendly staff, we ate here several nights it was soo good. I travel with a vegetarian so I mostly eat vegetarian too, and this was really good
5
We ordered hot and sour soup which was absolutely delicious. That was followed by Peking duck and sweet and sour chicken. Both of these were better than the meat based item as they were much less fatty and more tasty. We also have the olive fried rice for the first time which I thought was particularly good. Appetizers were boiled peanuts and pickled carrots and papaya, very tasty. The jasmine tea was very good. The staff were particularly helpful and pleasant the prices are very reasonable and I really enjoyed this meal I will definitely come back here again
4
Meal: The food was fantastic. We really enjoyed a the dishes. All of them were very tasty and served fresh.Atmosphere: The AC was pumping which made for a cooling atmosphere. It's located immediately opposite the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Off topic, but definitely another place to visit!Pricing: The only 'weird' thing about this restaurant were the extras. We got charged for wet napkins, peanuts, pickles and water. We didn't ask for any of these items, except for the water... On top of the that, they added the usual GST and 10% Service Charge. Other than these annoying extras, the place was a great. Our bill was about SGD $110 for 4 people. We 4 - 5 dishes with rice and noodles
4
Located near the Buddha temple at Chinatown. Clean and neat. Wide range of selection. Mock food also very good. Some of the dishes are slightly more oily but guess that would be to bring in the mock food feel. Value for money. They have set menu of SGD 298 for 8-10 people. Very fast service. Must repeat
5
Thoroughly enjoyable experience at Eight Treasures Vegetarian. There was a great selection available, and the staff was more than accommodating when adjustments needed to be made. I was there on a separate occasion to order take-out and they went out of their way to make sure that I was comfortable despite a near sell-out. A must go if you're vegetarian or vegan
3
I'm not a practicing vegetarian but I do generally enjoy veg over meat. the restaurant offers a good selection of dishes, with plenty of mock meat dishes. we asked for recommendations and ordered some kind of tofu dish, which we found a little too salty and oily. the dishes were generally quite all right, but not the best and yes, a little too oily for my liking
4
Unfortunately, I was on a very restricted medical diet when visiting Singapore. However, the staff at Eight Treasures went to extra length to prepare three imaginative dishes that met my requirements (no fat, no oil, no frying). I was very appreciative of their attentiveness on that point. The location and decor are excellent. I will definitely go another time when I will be able to eat more heartily. Definitely go if you are vegetarian or vegan
5
Very good vegetarian food and everything you would come to expect. The only thing I didn't really appreciate was gently being asked to over order which I realised afterwards. Definitely worth visiting in any case.

What I liked about this restaurant-1. Good location- very close to the Buddha tooth relic temple in Chinatown2. Ambience- Intimate (very subjective definition of this term)3. Vegetarian fare- Considering how difficult it is to find vegetarian food in many restaurants in Singapore, it was heartwarming to see a Chinese vegetarian restaurant.4. Variety of dishes- a decent spread of quintessential Chinese dishes prepared using faux meatMy friend and I ordered four dishes between the two of us- lotus root fritters for starters, the Peking duck with rice, Osmanthus red dates tea and mango pudding for dessert. There were also boiled salted peanuts available for a charge. The fritters were bordering on the greasy end while the Peking duck was crispy and more than filling. We were a little surprised to see that we were charged for the wet tissues that had been placed on our table. The staff were courteous and decent in their service time. Overall, I'd give a nod to this place for its decent fare
3
We had to bring an ovi-vegan for lunch and we had a hard time finding a vegetarian place in Chinatown for a sit-in meal until a colleague who was once a vegan recommended this eating joint! Ambience is good as it is at a spacious 2nd storey shophouse but food and service are average! Didn't enjoy the meal for it was also costly! However, we do not have much choice if a proper sit-down meal with a vegan is needed
1
After living as a vegetarian in Singapore for two years, I finally took a friend from Rome to Eight Treasures. We ordered a whole bunch of dishes but unfortunately were very disappointed. The spring rolls and fried oyster mushrooms were dripping in oil and pretty much tasteless. The main course of mushroom was bland, the friend string beans were spicy but otherwise not very flavorful. The pineapple fried rice was made with stale rice that was not even properly reheated, and had hardly any pineapple. All the food came in 5 minutes, so you can imagine how much culinary effort went into it.I can't believe how Eight Treasures is so highly reviewed on Tripadvisor. There are many other vegetarian restaurants in Singapore with much better food
5
We came here, two vegetarians, and were overwhelmed by the selection. The "fake" meats of all different kinds came in a variety of preparations. We chose three dishes, based on the waiter's recommendations, and were not disappointed. The "duck" (fried bean curd shell filled with mushrooms) was particularly good
5
The food is suitable for what I prefer and the price is affordable, it is hard to find as too many stalls disturbed our direction along the street, asked the local people there will help. The environment is china style and feel comfortable with it, the toilet is clean and nice too
4
This is the best vegetarian restaurant I've eaten so far. My family visit them frequently and we always visit Buddha Tooth Relic Temple after than. They are located at Sago Lane you will see it on the right hand side if you approach from South Bridge Rd. The entrance is a door leading to staircase. The dining areas are on the second and third floor. Yes.. you will have to climb up the stairs.The portion is not huge. When we ate there (with my family) we order about 4-5 dishes for the 3 of us. The portion is suitable for sharing so if you have more people you will get a chance to taste a good variety. I've attached 4 of my favourite dishes in this review. I really love their olive fried rice... yummy. The dishes there are not oily so it is suitable for the elderly who don't want to eat oily food.Our bill came up to $50-$60 most of the time for 4-5 dishes. You should give it a try if you are up for vegetarian food
5
It was a little while since we'd last been here and we forgot that the entrance is actually in Sago Street, and not South Bridge Road.Climbing the stairs from the street you are greeted by a quiet and cool oasis with no pretensions.We were given a very descriptive menu in English that made it easy to order. The problem with only 2 people dining together is how to pick what to eat without over-ordering.Most people can be ordered as either Small, medium or Large, and based on the Manager's recommendation we ordered a small Bok Choi plate, small noodle plate and medium Sweet & Sour "Chicken".As a pure vegetarian restaurant they don't even use garlic, something we normally enjoy in Asian foods, however all 3 plates were tasty and just the right amount of food.We'll return on our next visit to Singapore
5
This vegetarian restaurant is located in Chinatown and lots of local Singaporean people from Chinese descent come here. We were amazed by all the different mock-meats they had on their menu. The menu is large and even if you aren't a vegetarian you'll really love this place. Everything we ordered was delicious. If we ever go back to Singapore, we will be here again. Wonderful
3
What I found interesting was the large selection of meat substitute dishes. I would have preferred more original veggie dishes rather than re-creations. Having said that the dishes we had were tasty and the service was good. The decor is little run down and there were a few hidden costs. Not bad, could do better
2
Too expensive for what it is. Can't understand other reviews. Hidden cost from using napkin n eating the nuts which are brought to table. Not going again.
5
My wife and I were staying in the area and stumbled across this little gem. We were a little dubious at first because the although charming is somewhat dated. We ordered several dishes and they were all of excellent quality. The highlight of our meal was the wonderful soups. The service was also great and we would not hesitate to eat at this restaurant again
4
We ate lunch here as we walked through Chinatown. Great location just off the main Rd. The restaurant feels a bit outdated but that may be the look they were going for. We were there on a Sunday & there were lots of locals there celebrating Birthdays etc. Food was fast fresh & full of flavour. If you like curry get the vege 'mutton' curry. Tasted just like an authentic South Indian curry. ( better than Little India....). The price was also very reasonable.
5
We have been to this restaurant twice, once when very busy, once when not so busy. The service on both occasion was acceptable, but not exceptional. It is a fairly rustic and austere operation, but a step up from the street eating scene of nearby Chinatown. The desserts need some work, but the main courses are very tasty. An order for orange juice resulted in a large glass of freshly squeezed juice, which was great. It is priced fairly well, with a 3 mains meal shared between two and a drink each coming in at less than $S50. I am a meateater, but I am very happy to eat at this restaurant
5
The restaurant provided variety of vegetarian choices. All the dishes won't make you disappointed. It's super delicious! The location is great since it's just next to the famous Relic temple, China town. Reminder, since the restaurant is so busy, make sure that you reserve the seats first.
5
I've just had the most delicious dinner at Eight Treasure Vegetarian. We shared 4 dishes: fried olive rice, monkey face mushrooms (or something like that), wasabi prawns, and 8 treasure tofu. The tofu was the less successful dish but still quite tasty, the other three dishes were faultless. Three dishes would have been enough for two people though. Being the Chinese new year we were surrounded by big families and looking at their interactions contributed to the experience. We paid S65, which after a month in Laos came as a bit of a shock.
3
Food is OK, lots of imitation meat dishes will allow your veggie friends to sample your favourite Chinese meaty classics [suan la tang and gong bao ji ding amongst them]. Fine if your vegetarian friends have ever wondered, otherwise, little point other than for novelty.Tea ridiculously priced, but otherwise not too bad
5
This is by far our favorite vegetarian restaurant. The restaurant is not he second floor just across the side street from the Budda's Tooth Relic Temple. The restaurant can be busy so recommend calling ahead, especially if you have a large party.Once there, the staff is very friendly and appropriately attentive. The menu is quite large, offering just about anything you can think of, all without meat. Their olive fried rice is outstanding as is the sweet and sour chicken. In fact, we have tried many things and have not come upon anything that didn't taste great. While there are many desserts to choose from, we always go for the mango sago (with ice cream). Hope you enjoy it as much as we do
4
We ate at this restaurant tonight. It is next to the Buddhe Tooth Relic temple. It has 2 floors. The tables are nicely set and they serve you as soon as you arrive tasty nuts and pickles.The food menue is very vast and has mock dishes of many chinese and Singaporean classic dishes, in a vegeterian style.All we tasted was tasty and very nicely served
5
This was the best Chinese vegetarian food I had..... Names were so weird like monkey head, duck pecking, etc that we double checked if all foods were vegetarian. The friendly waiter reassured us and also made quite a few suggestions on what we could have, and we were not disappointed with it....!The only problem seemed that most of the dishes seemed too sweet after a few spoons. It is better to advise the waiter to make it spicier while ordering the food.I would definitely go there again
5
Loved this place. Great choice of vege meals and good service. Kung Bo Monkey Head mushroom was my fave! This place is now on my must visit restaurants when I am in Singapore.
4
Been here for few times, enjoyed the ambience and the good food. Plenty of options and definitely one of the better vegetarian restaurants in Singapore.
5
An amazing range of vegetarian Chinese offerings, each more mouthwatering than the other in a colourful locale of China Town, Singapore, makes this a wholesome evening for the entire family! A must visit even if you're willing to turn vegetarian, for just one evening!
5
Had a great dinner here. The menu featured multiple pages of vegetarian dishes. Our waiter made many helpful suggestions on what dishes to order. We didn't have to wait long for our food, and it was delicious! Dinner for two came to about 30 SGD. This would be a good place for a group- could then share multiple dishes
5
Superb food, great service, and the proximity of the Buddha Tooth Temple brings in monks routinely to eat. Is there any better recomendation for a vegetarian restaurant?We are living in Singapore but pescitarian westerners and have visted Eight Treasures several times alone, on public holidays and celebration dates, and with visitors. Always delighted. Uncle Christopher has been cited in other reviews and he is the ninth treasure. He is open pon suggestions and very sharing on cooking techniques and spices to get to their consistently fabulous outcome
4
We had lunch here during a stopover in Singapore.Our waiter, Christopher, was very helpful giving suggestions about the menu to meet our tastes; my wife prefers not to have anything spicy.We ordered a small size each of braised noodles, Peking duck and Sweet & sour fish, and whilst the food was served quickly and was well-presented we felt the serving sizes, whilst adequate for our lunch, were on the small side for the prices charged. The meals certainly did not taste like tofu, but resembled the meat or fish that they purported to be, and were very tasty.Our bill was S$42, including 10% service charge, about US$36. We're thinking that if a larger group ate together it might be better value because 4 people would not order double the amount of food that we had
5
Eight Treasures Vegetarian Restaurant is centrally located in China Town , close to Budhist Temple . It serves only vegetarian meals but its mock non vegetarian dishes are difficult to distinguish from real Non Vegetarian meals . One wonders how they prepare tasty vegetarian dishes with almost authentic taste, texture & flavours of lamb, chicken , shark fin & other meat dishes . It has good ambience , prompt service & reasonable cost . It is better to do advance booking to avoid long wait . For persons with some disability in climbing stairs is a little problem as it is located on first floor without any lift
4
Have been to 8 treasures twice, both times the food was good & the service efficient.It is great as a vegetarian to go to a place with an entirely vegetarian menu. It's well worth a visit, even for non veggies! It's a lovely cool escape when wondering around China Town
5
I am not a vegetarian but my wife is, and I can appreciate the relief when you don't have to worry about what's on the menu. Simply stated; I have never been to a better vegetarian restaurant than Eight Treasures in Chinatown.Some non-vegetarians laugh at the idea of mock-meat, you know, "why do they call it chicken when they don't want to eat chicken?", but the idea of mock meat dates back to the ancient Chinese dynasties who instructed their chefs to create vegetarian recipes with the appearance, texture, and taste of the Emperor’s favourite meat and seafood dishes. I believe it was for religious purposes but needless to say it is not some new-age fanciful idea.Do yourself a favour and try the Golden Veg Lemon Duck - I don't care what it is made of, it was so good I kept eating, and eating, and eating :)The service here was fast, friendly and extremely helpful…and my wife could choose whatever she liked without worry
5
This restaurant hidden in a chinatown backstreet was fantastic. Great food. Fake chicken satay lovely. May have felt overly fond of this place as it was air conditioned and I was melting at the time. Next door to the very impressive Budda's tooth temple. Just nice to go to a restaurant in Singapore where you were sure that you wouldn't be sat next to someone dismantling a crab with a hammer like a scene from Grand Theft Aqua

I really like vegetarian food here. You will enjoy your meal by chinese vegetarian style. Several menu to select. Good service and tasty. Eventhough you are not vegetarian, but you will like food here for sure. Impressed!

The restaurant is on the side of the tooth relic temple and it's not very visible from the street. 100% vegetarian with nice staff. Each dish has normally 3 prices for small medium and big dish.
Rice with olives was very good.

A treasure for a vegetarian.. we had eight treasure tofu and that was awesome! Just wish it was a little less salty.. the fried vermicelli was very good too.. very rich in flavour.. overall a very good restaurant right next to the temple.

A vegetarian restaurant that tries to emulate meat fish etc rather than doing the best it can with veg products. As a meat eater with a veggie partner I can eat veggie or not, but I don't see the point in trying to simulate. The results were a bit bland and slightly off texture. The establishment is also dry so don't expect a beer

First time visited this restaurant in Chinatown. Very satisfied with the foods and soup. We ordered a monkey head mushroom with black pepper and this was beyond our expectation. The corn soup also very tasty and recommended to take before the meal.We will be back here again but the server needs to be more attentive

YummmmmmmThere's really only one word to describe the food in this place. Ok, I am biased...food is close to hmmmmm...what can I say?! I am a vegetarian - actually, they say its vegan really! no dairy, no eggs for me...and I don't eat fake meat either...hence for a change, I went looking for a vegetarian restaurant. Typically, I just go to any regular restaurant and request them to fix something vegan for me.I had a local spinach soup - it was hot and absolutely divine! I complimented it with another fried dish - fried eggplants and this wonderful rice. Must order! the soup was very very basic...but it had this bland, bitter and sweet combination of some sort of red beans or raisins...I should have asked, as I am now writing this. sorry, didn't! the combination was excellent. and btw - when it arrives, it is extremely HOT! So please don't burn your lips or tongue. We know how it feels for quite a few hours.And the rice with fried eggplant...I know it sounds so blase...but it wasn't. I guess it also has to do with the mood one is in. I can assure you though that this place...is QUIET! shhhhh....for introverts like me...its a good thing...I like my quiet in noise! And chinatown is quiet full of sounds! and this place is on the first floor...its not a very large place, but by selectively putting these mirrors they have made it look vast! :) I laughed when I noticed...it did make the place look quite big! I went there in the afternoon and there was hardly anyone there...so I had the place to myself...off course, there was a lot of clitter clatter ...people talking, pots being moved, etc...anyways, back to the rice and eggplant. It was just perfect! and they had this...I don't know how to describe it...a mix of chopped greens and fried bits of something...it just made the whole thing taste really good...something that is basic, but made beautiful because of simple additions. I am a big fan btw of great ingredients and simple cooking. So, it worked for me.I hope you do make it to this place...its a 5 stars for me!and oops...I shd mention...its a bit on the expensive side...I paid SGD15 for the above.Cheer

After living in Singapore for two years, this has become my favorite restaurant here, and there are alot of great restaurants in Singapore! The food is excellent and the ambience has a wonderful local feel to it, as it is reached by ascending a flight of stairs off Sago Lane, opposite the Buddha Tooth Relic Buddhist Temple in Chinatown. Dishes are listed on the menu using names with meat in them, but there is no meat. Try the Black Pepper Chicken - you'll swear it is chicken, and it is delicious

I am a life long vege so was delighted to come across this restaurant, especially among such meaty and fishy places selling stuff which made me gag. Whilst I couldn't face the pretend meat food (eg abalone, sharks fin, suckling pig, duck etc) and opted for the simpler fare (beans and rice), I do understand this is a personal choice and it is great that these are available in a place where you can be confident there isn't any meat and fish your food will be contaminated with.Having said that my meal was okay / fine / acceptable and nothing to write home about, but did the job for 21 dollars. The restaurant doesn't sell alcohol by the way.I was a bit perturbed however when I was given 10 dollars less in my change. I understood this after a few minutes and when I asked the waitress to come to the table, she seemed to avoid eye contact but did eventually come to the table. I said I had given her a 50 and that I had 10 less than I should have had. She immediately, without thinking about it or considering if I could be wrong, apologised and gave me my 10. Whilst I was pleased that I didn't have to have an argument with her, I thought it very suspicious and was disappointed. Disappointed in the restaurant and disappointed because I had come to understand that ripping off tourists is not a trait for Singaporeans who seem to be law abiding and honourable. Particularly annoying and ironic given that service is included.For those two reasons, I wouldn't, with some sadness, return to this restaurant, and would recommend those that do to check their change

This is a quaint little place in the heart of China Town Singapore on the South Bridge Road, right next to the Buddha Temple serving veggie fare.. imagine a restaurant in China Town that serves veggie fare !! I was pleasantly surprised by this. The menu has a lot of attractions to choose from with weird sounding names like Suckling Pig !! However all was strictly vegetarian with no meat. The Jasmine tea and pickle went perfectly with the dishes we ordered.Definitely worth a visit while in Singapore

Even though we walked Chinatown on two different occasions during our visit, it wasn't until our local friend told us about this 2nd/3rd story gem, that we went. We vegetarians attended dinner with 3 carnivores and even they could not stop raving about the awesome food! There is an entore menu that reads things like: "Vegetarian Shrimp" or "Vegetarian Pork." And wow! Fantastic seems to be such an understatement! Take the time to find this place (next to the Buddhist temple) and you will NOT be disappointed

The ambience is good - nothing very exciting, but pleasant. The food is good - all vegeterian.
Service was efficient.
There were lots of small ants on our table, which was odd.

8 Treasures Vegetarian Restaurant: A great location right next to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum on South Bridge Rd., in Chinatown. The food is healthily delicious; a good menu with a peaceful, friendly ambience. The manager, Zenna, is wonderfully efficient, professional and helpful and the pricing is very reasonable. We ate their twice, and can't wait to go back again

While I don’t think the cuisine at Eight Treasures is very good, the service was very attentive. The waiter (Christopher) who I think was the owner, was very helpful and friendly. What I didn’t like at all was the huge choice of fake meat on the menu, which sometimes seemed to be too much. As a vegetarian I don’t need to eat fake meat to be satisfied, but obviously this is an extremely personal feeling. We didn’t see a lot of fresh vegetables on the menu and this to me doesn’t sound very healthy, but we might have missed something. We had many courses as recommended by the waiter, but I can’t remember the name of anything. I can say that everything was salty and the taste was very strong (and not always in a good way), but nothing was very memorable. They have a very simple dining room, but not bad, and a nice view of the nearby Buddha Temple. It’s not an expensive restaurant for this city. But surely there are many other good restaurants for the same price. Anyway I have to note again the friendliness of the waiter but I’d probably never return

My wife and I are not vegetarian, but we do have dietary restrictions (no pork, no shellfish), so finding a restaurant in the Chinatown area in Singapore was difficult for us. We found Eight Treasures and could not have been more pleased. As I said, we don't have to eat vegetarian and typically would not, but this restaurant was a wonderful find.All prices given are Singapore dollars (about 80 cents USD).We split the olive fried rice ($6) and I had the honey lime chicken ($12, it wasn't really chicken, it was vegetarian, but tasted like chicken), my wife had the monkey head mushrooms ($10, brings back visions of the lunch scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) and mushroom kung bao. She also had the flower tea ($6).The restaurant was not busy the day we were there. The decor is simple, nothing fancy, yet clean. My wife enjoyed it enough that she would seek out this restuarant again when we are in Singapore, which says a lot, she's a real foodie

With so many eateries around Chinatown proudly displaying chicken feet or pig intestine delight it was (as a vegetarian) somewhat of a relief to find eight treasures .... Page after page of interesting purely vego dishes. The monkey head mushrooms are a must-have. As are the fried lotus root.

I have visited this restaurant many times, while the choices for dishes are plenty they really need to make improvement in "renewing" what they could serve. After a while, you would be wondering what you could order. The dishes taste differently each time I visited that place, hence I guess it depends on which chef / cook was on duty there and then.Service wise, there is definitely a need for improvement

My wife and I searched Chinatown for a vegetarian restaurant which proved to be no mean feat. We stumbled across 8 Treasures yesterday as we explored the markets and decided to go tonight. We were blown away by both the service and food.Staff were extremely friendly and helpful in suggesting options and add ons like green chilies with our rice. The menu is extensive and you can dine there every day for a week and still order different dishes each day. We ordered the crispy lemon vegy duck with lemon sauce, bean curd sate sticks, assorted mushroom roll and the olive fried rice. Dishes come in small, medium and large sizes and we picked small so we could sample a few dishes. The food was amazing. We were surprised at the flavour and texture of our meal. All up our meal cost S$47 and we walked away very happy. We are flying out tomorrow and will probably end up there for lunch before we head to the airport.If you are a meat eater (like myself) you won't be disappointed. I left wanting more and wanting to come back. If you are a vegetarian, you will love this restaurant

They have a lot of selection of vegetarian food to choose. But the waiting time for the food is abit too long, estimated 20min for 1or 2 food order. Overall the food is nice. Servicing is average.Still will come and eat , but hope won't be waiting too long

This restaurant has an extensive vegetarian menu and offer a range of teas. You are given beans to nibble on before your meal and every meal was delicious. The staff were very friendly and attentive. Note: There were a couple of small extra charges on our bill that we were not expecting - you will be charged for the pre-dinner beans and the wet towels

We live in Bali and are regular visitors to Singapore. My partner is a vegetarian and though I am not, I certainly appreciate finely prepared food be it vegetarian or not. We are staying in a hotel around the corner from Eight Treasures and went there for dinner last night. We were greeted by the lovely "m'aitre d" named Christopher who guided us through the rather large menu. I highly recommend the "monkey head mushrooms with roasted chili". It is fabulous! Everything we had (and we tried 4 or 5 different dishes, possible because 3 different sizes of each are available) was truly delicious, made with very fresh ingredientsand nicely presented. Excellent food. Knowledgable staff. Highly recommended
