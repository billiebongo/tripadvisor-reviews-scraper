Japan town is a food lovers paradise, full of amazing food. The fried chicken restaurant, the beef place, nobe seizan and the first sushi shop on the right are all amazing.

Newly opened food attraction in the heart of Orchard road at the Wisma Atria. Japan Food Town offers many varieties of japanese cuisines from different prefectures of Japan. Even the chefs are Japanese. A great place for your japanese dining.

For this price, I expected a Japanese level of service but I didn't get it. Pity.
This place offers nothing like a Japanese Izaka experience, not even sure why it is called Izakaya.....

Quality of food is ok but if considered the price they are charging ..... the rating drops to average only.
Service is so so.

Came to Gyu Jin shabu shabu and ordered the Japanese wagyu (of course!!!). Yummy yummy yummy! Selection of other food is good. Green vegetables..tofu... udon... carrots..Japanese rice... ice cream.. and more! Sauces... will definitely come back!

I must say the Japanese food from Hokkaido Izakaya is excellent and fresh. Price point is very reasonable for the quality and variety of the seafood.
Highly recommend for people who like golf quality Japanese Sashimi.

Having lived in Japan for 3 months last year I really missed japanese food. Japan Food Town is great! It feels like you are back in Japan! I had the Soba and it was sooo good! Couldn't taste the difference that I wasn't in Japan :

Decided to try out Japan Food Town and went for Shabu Shabu. They had all you can eat offer for dinner - time limit 90 minutes. Lunch time it is 60 mins. It is one of the best Shabu Shabu I have had in over 20 years - last one being in Osaka. The meats were excellent. Vegetables & tofu were fresh. Pity dessert was just ordinary ice cream. Price was unbelievable - best value for money. Anybody who likes Japanese food, go there.

There are different restaurants with the Japan Food Town. Hokkaido Izakaya is the one we went to. This is the other outlet, with its first in Tanjong Pagar. As expected, there is a line. Was here during the 1 year anniversary so there was a promo going on. Tried their Sirloin Steak and Kobore Sushi which were fantastic. The crab miso soup somehow made us really thirsty after. Although it was busy the manager and staff were attentive whenever we needed anything. So go back again.

@TheKuoKnowsShabu Shabu or Sukiyaki?For me, it has to be meat on a hotplate every time, especially when it is an eat-as-much-as-you-like beano. There is a time limit at Gyu Jin, though.Apart from the endless supply of red meat, there is plenty of vegetables to complement the protein.For a break from meat, the wide selection of mushrooms make for an interesting interlude.Service was top drawer............I have to commend the waiter who almost singlehandedly had to ensure that the buffet was well stocked, diners demands were met and cash was collected promptly.At around $30 a pop for the basic option, Gyu Jin is not bad value. It is casual, it is clean and it's comforting. Nothing better

The Wagyu beef was divine. Thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience of cooking the meat ourselves to our own individual liking on a vented hot plate.

Decide to had lunch at Hokkaido Izakaya as place seems popular but wasn't impressed for the Salmon and beef stew set. For salmon serving, there is only had 4 small slices. No value for the price paid.

This is our 2nd visit to the Japan Food Town for dinner and this time at the Hokkaido Izakaya. As it was the week before Christmas the place was crowded and full so we have to wait 20 mins to be seated but well worth the wait.We had the special Christmas set which includes a decent portion of Salmon Sashimi, Wagyu Roast Beef and the Hokkaido Hotpot which comes with an assortment of seafood, all the food were delicious!The prices here are quite reasonable for the quality, will come back again for sure

I work nearby so I often go there.I visited the Ramen, Cold udon, sushi and Hokkaido place.They were all very good. Not the very unsavory type of restaurant. It seems very authentic to me and definitely a change from the usual sushi Tei and co. (That I also like by the way). Next try will be the Saba one or the cold Soba. But I am sure i won't be disappointed

I was here with my family for dinner, went in to Tonkatsu Anzu as it has what we felt like eating... We got a seat pretty quickly and looked through the memu, mostly in japanese and not many pictures. I think if they add more pictures or at least a translation of what the set includes will be good... i asked one of the staff (Yong Peng) who patiently explained and answered my queries with courtesy.We settled for a Gin-jo pork katsu (fatty loin) set, king salmon set and a kids meal.The food was served quickly and the staff (Yong Peng) explained patiently the different sauces & condiments they placed on our table and how to the food should be best enjoyed.Pork katsu was tender & juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside. Unlike some places where the katsu is pretty tough and dry.King salmon set is fried well, thus retaining the natural juices inside and crispy outside.My toddler was kinda reluctant to eat her food initialy as she took some time to get used to japanese food, but after a while, liked it so much she finished whatever we put on her plate.I really want to give the thumbs up for the good services we were given by Yong Peng and Chelsia.My toddler dropped her spoon several times and they gave us a new one each time without any displeasure.I will return again to try other items on the menu for sure

I went there for dinner and they served only hotpot at night. It cost s$180/pax. Service was not attentive, poor tea refill service. The waitress did not really explain to us when they served the food.But I would like to highlight that the food was so good. Everything is fresh. They offered Japanese appetiser, seasonal vegetables, snowcrab croquette, Omi A5 Wagyu beef, porridge. I found out even the water in the soup they use are brought directly from Japan. I love the food but I think it is overpriced.

The world loves Japanese food. SEIZAN, located a Japan Food Town, at Wisma Atria is certainly a gem not to be missed by any Japanese food lover. Upon arrival at the restaurant we were greeted by two lovely service staff, Arlene and Cassandra, who made us feel instantly welcome. They outlined the choices professionally and served us happily under the watchful eye of Restaurant Manager Yanagi Masatoshi who came three months ago from the Tokyo "mothership" Seizan (a two star Michelin Kaiseki venue). The decor is understated and the venue can seat around 24 guests in a calm environment (modern Japanese). Everything that was served was nothing short of excellent. We started with the Premium Dashi Nabe that was refreshing and appetizing. One felt like being transported to the best of Japan's nature and once the the Wagyu Mabushi (grade 5 wagyu beef) arrived, we knew that ingredients were the best and those Michelin stars did not come by accident. First we tried it "pure" - and the beef was just perfect. Then we mixed the spices with the rice and the beef and the result was a burst of freshness and flavor combined with excellent wagyu beef. And finally, we added Dashi with all ingredients and were delighted with another taste sensation. The entire dish would win awards in Japan ... anytime.Even the tea served was of higher quality than most Japanese teas available in Singapore. Ending our luncheon with the dessert of the day was another culinary experience being presented with a lovely and refreshing custard, fruit, and jelly creation.SEIZAN's team are eager to please and proud of their menu (and so they should). This is the place for high quality food. Having only beef or fish to choose from, the selection process is easy and the food and service quality will likely dazzle you. If you have little time do lunch. Should you prefer a more relaxed meal, come for dinner and Wagyu Dashi Nabe..... this place is a must try

Japan Food Town is a great new concept: basically a food court, but with higher quality Japanese restaurants (although you can only eat in specific restaurants, rather than mix and match). Built (almost) as a courtyard house with various ramen/soba/sushi restaurants built around it, it offers a lot of choices. I tried one of the soba places; will have to go back and try others.

While I am very impressed with choices of restaurants, we chose Inaniwa Yosuke to have our dinner. We had dinner very late at about 9pm so there was no queue. The waitress was ok to let us dine in but her expression was emotionless with no smiles but not grumpy either. The texture of the udon is thin and chewy and it was very good. The soy dipping sauce was in my opinion too salty and too sharp? It was ok. The sesame dipping sauce was lacking in depth. The broth of the hot soup is very light, refreshing and citrus, I was expecting more umami flavors

So after all the fanfare in the newspapers, I had to come down and see what it was all about. We came relatively early so as to avoid the crowds . There were no crowds inside Japan Food Town but there was a long queue outside the Koh Japanese place which persisted even after we left Japan Food Town - so in all honesty, maybe that is the place to go if one wants Japanese Food. Otherwise we went to Japan Food Town as we wanted to give it a try. Many choices but we couldnt really tell the difference from outside. They had a fried chicken place, noodles place, sashimi place and a couple of places that show-cased beef. In the end we went to the Seizan as their unique marketing point was that the chef had two-michelin stars. It was a simple concept - 2 set keys and take your pick between the sea bream or the beef. Each course can be eaten 3 ways but the best way and really what should be the only way would be with the dashi soup which was very good. I may be back again to try some of the other restaurants within this area but in reality it is a hype about all these places located around the same place - ultimately it is about whether if the individual restaurants are good at what they do.
