Good service by staff and food was pretty good. We had pre-ordered food as our reservation was at 8pm. The staff and managers have made it possible!

At the time we patronized the restaurant, the waiter informed us a lot of dishes were not available anymore. Thus, it left us limited selection for a group of 7 people. Food was pretty ok although portion was small.

The first in its chain (which now has a few more in the heartlands), this restaurant in a neighbourhood is popular with locals for family gatherings and celebrations serving good value Hokkien as well as other local dishes through the years.

I was invited to dinner at this restaurant. Found food to be fresh and well prepared. Do not know which Chinese cuisine is their speciality, but found all courses delicious. Service was efficient and friendly. Found out they serve Teochew porridge buffet Monday-Friday. Returned on a Monday 2 weeks later and was very pleased with the offerings - very authentic - cost was also very reasonable S$70 for 5

My dad would prefer to have Chinese food for his birthday and nearby our house, so my brother decided to choose Gim Tim. You can choose outdoor or indoor seat. They will close all the outdoor seat if it's after 19.30 pm. We ordered crispy roasted duck, salted egg crab. black pepper crab, bean curd with melon, fish maw thick soup and bun. My dad was disappointed with the food especially the crispy roasted duck. I would say the food was more to the salty preference which my dad cant take too salty food.One pros for this restaurant is there is no service charge. All the food on my photo costs about $170 for 6 pax

Had a family lunch at this restaurant and ordered the Buddha Jump Over the Wall where preorder was required. The ingredients were of good quality although the ingredients' variety seemed to fall short compared to another eatery such as Kian Seng with just abalone, dried scallop, two types of fish maw, mushroom, shark's fins, duck's web, chicken feet and black chicken soup. The soup was not as aromatic as i had wanted. Maybe the fish maw used was not from male fish. But the other dishes were good such as Peking duck, prawns in oats and steamed garoupa. The staff also offered good service to change our plates and top up our tea frequently despite seven other large tables in the small restaurant. Only when i relooked the bill after reaching home did i realise that they did not charge for service. Will give them a fat tip on my next visit

I went there with the family after reading one articles about some of the oldest restaurant in Singapore.The place is almost hidden , but has been a nice surprise: the food is delicious, tasty and the portion not so small.I would not consider the pace for a couple as it's a bit noisy, and the menu suggest more the classical idea of sharing between few people instead of a one2one

We met some friends here for lunch at their recommendation and left quite impressed with the food. They have three branches, and this particular branch does a roaring trade during dinnertime. They had a promotion of Peking Duck for S$30, instead of the usual S$60. The duck was quite meaty and the skin was crispy. What was nice was that the staff sliced the skin by the table and then wrapped them in the pancake skins. The excess meat was then cooked with thin noodles into a rather substantial dish. We also ordered ngoh hiang, or meat/prawn rolls, and they were quite tasty, though without the strong five spice taste that is commonly found in this dish at other places. Their braised pork with steamed white buns was also quite good, though I thought that the omelette with prawns was rather bland. The sliced tapioca cooked in sambal with kang kong was not too bad.At the start of the meal, they served the usual braised peanuts and a rather nice side of deep fried fish skin. While not the most healthy option, it whetted the appetite.Service was very good and staff were constantly on hand to top up the drinks
