Went to the branch at marina square. They have variety of drinks and coffee. I like their cafe latte. Big cup at 6 bucks. Good enough for me to be back!

A small place somehow excentric/pop, but with a good expresso coffee.
Various drinks (hot or cold) available, and some food too, up to the pizza.
Good service.
Not cheap.

The sweet potato latte is interesting but the coffee taste was quite week. Royal milk tea was really fragrance. Hazelnut cake was good. Overall I really like the ambience, pretty spacious though the beverages were on the more expensive side.

Nice espresso. The cafe is very spacious and the ambience is comfortable. A place that you can chill and relax.

I visited this new concept Korean cafe at Centrepoint to chill out while waiting for my facial appointment. The concept of the cafe is where coffee meets music. The spacious and cosy ambience is indeed an ideal place to meet up with friends to chit chat or even for individuals to idle and watch the world go round. There is a reasonable range of coffee with three options of flavourings. The coffee can always be served with a slice of cake from their bakery selections. My order was paddlecop cheesecake with rose latte of their K1 option (nutty flavour).The only con about the place is the over pricing of tbeir items. But if you plan to spend longer time there then it may worth the price

Came here twice to do some work and on both times, enjoyed myself. the coffee was good, though slightly steep in price, but it is quiet and there are plenty of seats around with power sockets so if u want to do some work in a quiet cafe, this is highly recommended in the centre of orchard road.

Checking this place out after the hype goes down a little bit :)You can see Descendants of the sun poster, the famous plushies appeared in the drama, and the background music. Very nice!And chill with coffee. I ordered their signature cream coffee but there wasn't bigger size. Vanilla latte is nice to

Stopped by for a cup of latte, didn't expect one large hot latte costs $7, one cold large latte costs $8 and one slice of rainbow cake costs $8. This is way expensive. Coffee is not hot enough and for the price, I can easily spend it at Starbucks for 2 Venti size of coffee. Hmm, not value for money.
