This place surprised me .., The ambiance and place is average but the food is lip smacking .. tried many types of starters here with cola ... lovely food ... A visit is definitely pending here
5
Very nice Pakistani restaurant. Yummy, cheap and great atmosphere to sit in. Love the butter chicken, paya and pepper prawn. Hand-made naan also …. Will definitely be back to try others on the menu!
4
Great flavourful food. Love the tandoori chicken and kheema. Hand-made naan also.. Try to go before peak period especially. Otherwise, be prepared to endure slow service/food..
5
Awesome sizzling chili chicken and tandoori chicken tikka to die for! Went well with masalah tea and butter naan!!
4
Since many years this is a must for me. I like their Tandoori Chicken, Aloo Methi (potatoes with fenucreek), Somosa, Raita, Naan (many kind) and mutton curry and a delicous masala tea. You will rarely see tourists. That is good for me
4
Its a Pakistani restaurant, very good, yummy.Known flavors.They have some sizzlers dish which is higly recommended, their tea is also very good.
Its also very reasonably priced.
5
Must visit this place for food
Rabbi suggested us tandoori chicken biryani it was fantastic. Very reasonable priced

What's Good.......while visiting little India we were looking for Indian food and decided try the outlet as we were very hungry and needed quick service.The ambience was typical Indian fast food joints kinda look.The restaurant was serving wide variety of non-veg food too.Nan was the speciality and so was the fast service.Locals prefer the joint to have a chit-chat over a cup of tea there.What's bad....... hygiene issues but that's ok , it was much better than many fast food joints we visit locally
5
Ordered cheese naan, mutton sheekh kebab, tandoori chicken,mutton masala,lassi and masala tea for 2 pax and the bill was only $27! Every dish was yummy but my favourite was the masala tea and sheekh kebab! I highly recommend this place but just take note that the ambience is of a roadside eatery. If you donâ€™t mind the ambience, then this is the best place for an affordable Pakistani/ north indian meal!
5
I often laugh at the number of travellers who rate themselves as 'adventurous', but on a recent trip to Little India I noted we were one of the few westerners to venture into this exotic heartland of Singapore on this particular afternoon. But where to eat? I noted previous good reviews of Usman Restaurant and the place had quite a few locals eating there so my wife & I have it a go. The staff were welcoming on arrival and helpful with the choice of food. We ordered four dishes plus drinks and the bill came to $28 - very reasonable.
4
Tasty food which won't break the bank balance! don't expect high expectations of a nice restaurant because it isn't! What you are guaranteed is mouth watering food, try the paneer makhani and sheekh kebabs! Great service as well!
4
Almost all the different dishes I had at Usman are tasty. They also have Haleem and Nihari but you will need to check with the waiter or the manager if it is available.
5
Your life is incomplete until you try the nihari. Get some naan. And end your meal with a masala tea.
2
We ordered mutton briyani and mince with Roti's. It was not tasty or to the expectations of what these dishes should be. The biryani was just a mutton gravy dish added to biryani rice. The meat was so tough. The mince was so over fried. We did enjoy the fresh lime soda
4
There are not a whole lot of pakistani places in singapore. When I am in need of some nihari or haleem this is my go to spot. There are lots of paki restaurants where I come from but this is the closest I have come to a good one in Singapore
4
I consulted yelp to find this restaurant, I was only about a block and a half away so I walked on over. The sign on the front says Pakistani and North Indian food. There are tables setup outside, inside you will find the food counter. If you are ordering To-Go you can order at the register, if you will be dining in move to the far end and place your order.There was one family in front of me, after they placed their order I placed mine, I ordered Chicken Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Biryani Rice, and Onion Naan. I also ordered two bottled waters. The gentleman taking the orders didn't write them down but he repeated mine and got it right. The drink coolers are to the right of the counter, go get whatever drink you ordered and bring it to your table.You can see one of the staff making your Naan to order. The food soon started arriving, everything was very enjoyable. Something else I liked was the price, probably the least expensive in the area.Your order has been written down and your cheque is waiting at the cash register. When you are ready to pay just go up to the order window and tell them you are ready to pay, you will be asked where you were setting, point to your table and they will know which cheque is yours

Just popped into this lovely restaurant in Little India, Singapore, while exploring the city. They serve a range of North Indian and Pakistani dishes. Most of them (masalas, curries, butter chicken, etc.) are ready made and therefore served pretty quickly. I had some chicken masala and garlic naan as side order for 6,5 SGD (about 4â‚¬). Both were exceptionally delicious - with the naan freshly prepared out of the oven and the garlic on it crispy roasted. Prices are comparable to most street food in Singapore and therefore fine if you travel on a budget. I would go there any time again. Just in case, this restaurant does not serve any alcohol

@TheKuoKnowsFor a bit of al fresco, semi-street-side, no-fuss dining in Little India, there is probably none better than Usman. It sits on the corner of Desker Road and Serangoon Road.Usman specialises in North Indian cuisine. Because it is a standalone eatery rather than a hawker stall, prices tend to be a tad higher. But not outrageously so.As a North Indian specialist, anything from the tandoori oven are a must, especially those oven-fired bread. They go with just about everything.They pair well with the sizzling Jalfrezi, which comes with quite a kick. Both the Prawn and Chicken Jalfrezi are top of the shop. Thank goodness for a cooling tankard of Mango Lassi, though.Service comes with a beaming smile. The waiting staff are affable, amiable and even have time for a quick joke. Usman is a real credit to uber-casual dining in Singapore. A must-try
1
My family decided to satisfy our naan and other north indian food cravings at this restaurant. But every dish we ordered was disappointing and was basically tasteless. The butter chicken was a horrible example of what a butter chicken should be, it was very watery and had no hint of butter on it. The naan itself was cold and dry, the chilli chicken was great in aesthetics , but it caused a serious upset in my stomach after a while. I believe the chicken they used was not fresh. Those who are looking for north indian food ,there are much better and affordable restaurants in singapore who offer much better and delicious food. For me, Usman is over -rated and did not live up to its name
4
A Friend inform that we should try the naan of Usman, we went there and the coffee shop look quite crowded. We had naan and chicken and mutton curry, they were superb although I don't take naan so often but it was very nice and satisfying. Great place for naan bite
5
great experience and meal at the Usman. We had Chicken Tikka, Dahl and Naan bread. So good! We are looking forward to returning
4
Located near mustafa centre. Best joint for mughlai lovers. Food is awasome at reasonable rates.only sitting area on road side n service is not upto the mark.
2
Expensive compared to the one in Serangoon. Restaurant wasn't packed but managed to miss an order that was placed.
Naan, butter chicken aren't as tasty as the Serangoon branch.
Service however is good and food delivered fairly promptly.
Overall, would prefer the serangoon branch.
5
All the times that I went here they serve me with very tasty Garlic Cheese Naan. The Chilli Chicken is nice too. Their service is damn fast. Would always recommend to people for this restaurant for the Best Naan in town.
5
We actually book our international travel through the gateway city of Singapore because of Unmans. It is just a small street cafe with big flavor and delicious Pakistani food. Our favorite is the sizzling black pepper paneer but all is good, including their lassis.
4
The restaurants at Serangoon and at Bedok Market Place serves good food which isn't heavy on your wallet. They are quite good with Mughlai cuisine. Do try their fixed sets as they are value for money.
3
Went here with family and friends hear a lot about the haleem served here, It was more like Daliya may be my expectations where more close to the the original one (Hyderabadi Haleem) over all good food.
5
Usman has had a facelift. It has a more modern look and they even have a computerised POS. But don't be fooled, it may look more modern but the dishes served are still as wonderful as they have always been. This is always the first stop for my wife and me when arriving in Singapore. We pretty much always order the same meals and are yet to walk away with anything but a smile on our face. Chicken Tikka, Palak Paneer, Yellow Rice (biriyani) and the old faithful Dahl Fry. This last dish is so simple yet so delicious. Usman use split peas and the Dahl is reduced so that there is very little liquid remaining - the caramelised onions compliment the flavours as well. I'm not sure if their Dahl is unique but in all of our travels, we have not been able to find one that compares. Enjoy
1
Waiters will force you to order the more expensive dishes on the menu as it will be freshly cooked and sizzling hot!We ordered from the cheaper side of the menu and received cold tasteless dishes, the naan are also a rip off as at nearly 2$ they are less than half the size of a normal naanWhile we were eating I overheard a customer claiming he had been overcharged, with the experience we had so far I made a note of my expected cost. When it came to the bill I found they had charged for an extra naan, when I complained they claimed it was an error!The owner in plain clothes also hawks on all of the customers and secretly directs the waiters towards vulnerable customersAvoid!!!!!!
5
MUST ORDER their "Special" Lamb Briyani Rice. Although many said it's just fried rice, but it tastes Awesome (even in every way it really does taste like fried rice). Nothing too great for other dishes though. That's the only dish I'd order, the rest are disappointing
1
The food is highly over rated. We tasted the Paya , Butter chicken, mutton Biryani and Lassi.
Except Lassi all other items were very poor quality, you could taste the spice mixes.
Any Indian stall in a hawker centre will serve better tasting food.
5
If you visit Mustafa center area, l would highly recommend try this place. Chicken tikka masala and garlic nan are my favorite. Reasonable price and great favor. Highly recommend.
5
Visited this place via recommendation from TripAdvisor. Very nice Indian food, very cheap and great atmosphere to sit in. Service was great. Highly recommend a visit.
3
If you are looking for halal food so this is your quick service ready meals option restraunt.
We had many dishes but all were average.
Its a budget restraunt in an expensive singapore.
4
USMAN serves authentic Pakistani / Indian cuisine. The Nihari is the best in Singapore and is a must try with the garam (hot) freshly baked nan from the Tandoor. The restaurant is located in a heritage area within Little India, stays open late at night. Other dishes such as haleem, Karhi, Paya are also worth a try. The restaurant is a regular haunt for the locals and for take aways and that in itself is an endorsement
5
Such a great restaurant very nice stuff halal food it's my second visit to Singapore and I love to go usman I gave 10/10 location is cool view is good when you sit in restaurant near by little India and the tea of this restaurant i am loving i
4
Rally nice curries. Whenever I go, I visit this restaurant and take their food back home. They back your Nan just before the serve you and are extremely hot, which I love! They sometimes do not serve but their prawn dishes are other superb choices! It is just an open cafe at the corner of the steer but worth trying! よく利用させていただいております。日本人好みなんでしょうか他の店よりこのパキスタンスタイルのカレーが無性に好きです！ほうれん草のパラクパニーニとか素晴らしい料理もあるのですが、忙しいとなかなか出してくれなかったり、へそ曲がりな店ですが、何をたべても辛過ぎず、大変美味しいです。道端にオープンで立っている店ですが侮るなかれ、です
4
10 years in Singapore and this is my regular little India joint \ and i just discover them in tripadvisor obviously.it's cheap, it's tasty and there is good choice - why go to a much more expensive restaurant.the basic order for me are their naan, fresh and fluffy, and Massala tea. as for the rest, i just pick in their standard offering although they also offer cooked dishes.maybe their channa massala has degraded over time - at least i do not like it as much as i remember; you need also be aware that the tandori chicken that has already been cooked is just microwaved before serving \ but i must say that in the many such places i visited, this is always what i experienced, so...a very good choice for hawker+ price
5
This restaurant is super busy. It is on a street corner and open on both sides. You eat on the pavement, there is no indoor area. The food is very authentic as can be seen by the number of Pakistani and Bangladeshi customers. Of course the food is halal and no alcohol is served. You choose the food from a display cabinet and a waiter puts it on a plate for you. I like the mutton dishes here (such tender meat),and the naan breads
4
Nestled at the corner of desker road and Serangoon rood, this corner shop is quite popular with locals. Prices are very reasonable. Food is nice and tasty. Briyani, naan, tandoori.... Yummy. Naturally air conditioning though.... So on a hot day.... You get free sauna with your food too. Luckily there're ceiling fans... So there you go.Not that neat and place could do with some cleaning. Staff here is friendly and patient. Quite tough to be so especially with the heat and crowd....Overall food is good with the prices paid.Happy eatin
5
We were super surprised by the delicious Haleem served here. I haven't tried other dishes but will do next time. Do not miss out on the Haleem. It's absolutely delicious.
4
Desi food in desi way. very close to Mustafa center. variety of local Pakistani food along with choice of some continental food. I like their Nehari and qeema (mince) fried.
Hot and fresh nan( bread)
4
Awesome cuisine! Food is ultimately tasty and good varieties available, Must try are naan bread, paya, haleem and kebabs. Local food stall seating is available, service is quick. Staff is quiet friendly and cater to your requirements
4
Tried the Nihari and it tasted amazing! Just like we have it back home. Naans were fresh! Tea wasn't so good and for that I give it 4, not 5 stars
4
I was yearning for an affordable yet stumptous north Indian food in Singapore.while walking in little India,I stopped by at usman as I see it was crowded with people enjoying their meal.So I decided to dine there.I ordered 2 cheese garlic naan and keema.Though they were understaffed,the services was quick and within 10 minutes,I got my food.It was so delicious.I enjoyed my meal.Definitely will be coming for other varieties when I am in Singapore again
5
We were taking some family members around Little India and wanted to make sure they got to taste some authentic Indian food. This corner restaurant, with no A/C and basic food court style seating, is a real gem. They have a real tandoori oven and make great naan and roti. The Tandoori chicken was great, as was the palak paneer. The vindaloo was also very tasty. If you aren't looking for a fancy place, but are interested in tasty food, consider this place for a great, reasonably priced meal
5
Really good food (and great Nan!). I've had several meals here, they've never failed me. Cash only, affordable, no alcohol but the mango lassi makes you forget that. Not the cleanest looking place in town, and bring your own napkins (tissues). Busy corner which adds to the experience. Friendly crew working there too. Highly recommended
5
I ate at this place 4 times during my 5 day visit to Singapore . I visited some other places too in the vicinity like kebabs and curries and kept on coming back to this place as their food was just too good . This is definitely the best Indian / Pakistani / Mughlai restaurant in the Little India area . It's a small place with no ambience but food which is worth dying for . Try the nahari with butter naan . We tried biryani too here but it was OK . chicken karahi is also worth having. Gem of a place . will come back here again whenever we visit Singapore
4
Usman is one of the few places in singapore, where you can indulge in some lip smacking north indian & muslim dishes at relatively cheap rate.The ambience though not very clean, the waiters make sure the table reserved by you is clean (sometimes you need to make a request ;-))The restaurant is safe for families to dine in, however mostly you will find singles or bachelor groups more.It is conviniently located just few steps away from Mustafa centre
4
We went there to try their seekh kebab and nihari. The naan took a little long to be made but when all was set and done it tasted quite nice. The home made ice lemon tea was highly refreshing as well.I would highly recommend this restaurant as it contrasts quite well with the vegetarian restaurants it is surrounded by
4
The food is great, really tasty and filling. I went a few times and tried the whole menu! My favourites are the naan and the bone marrow. The place could be more clean though, I didn't like the toilet inside the kitchen, not very hygienic
2
I visited this place with my friend. Food is not so great and quantity is very less. Dint like the place and there was bill problem at the end and people were not so courteous.
5
Great food, dal and naan fantastic and chicken dishes very tasty. Also, friendly service and try their own made lime juice which goes very well with the food.
5
Great restaurant with Pakistani food. Visit as well the coffee shop at the Desker rd junction Serangoon rd. naans are just fantastic!
5
Awesome, cheap & Freshly prepared food. food takes few minutes to arrive after order. Though not so fancy in terms of sitting area. It's like any other hawker center.
4
It was a typical Friday night, im looking for a dinner spot on TripAdvisor to bring my girl to. Picked out usman and was there in a flash. Ordered the butter chicken, garlic Naans, palek paneer and tandoori chicken. Boy o boy we were in for a treat! Everything came in abt 10mins from e time we ordered. Service was really good! But the food was nothing short of delicious. If you're looking for a place to have a quiet romantic dinner ->look elsewhere. But if you're up for an authentic, affordable and delicious Indian meal then usman is the spot for you my friend. Top tips - lime juice is really good! Parking wise->Park in the open air car park opposite usman, safe and it only costed abt $1.20 for 2 hrs. P. S don't forget to grab yourself an impeccable garlic Naan! Just wow!
4
Delicious food. Fresh tasty kebabs and biryani. Very freindly attentive staff who are happy to recommend dishes and spice levels if you want less spicy food and are not familiar with the cuisine. They do buffets in the afternoon during the weekdays and is a great value for mone
4
Went to have dinner at Usman twice. Both have chicken Tikka with different variety of naan. The first dinner I tried garlic naan and kashmiri naan, the second time I had cheese and kashmiri naan. Consistency of the Tikka is good, went there twice and it was taste good. If you're in Little India and would like to have late night dinner (I went there at 12am) this is a place to go. Naan is always good. Don't let it sit cool though.
3
Most of foods here is ready to put on plate following my orders. Bariyani rice with lamb / chicken was nice. It's flavorful and lots of herbs aroma. Chicken tikka is a bit spicy to me. As food is so cheap. Do not expect service or ambiance. I just came here for quick eat and go. I visited this place twice now no issue of anything.
1
This is an average roadside eatery, mostly patronised by local community. The hygiene is lacking and water in the jugs may not be potable. No tissue paper provided after having greasy Roti and Chicken Tikka Masala (charge 30 cents). Average cost for 1 person 14.5 USD is high. There are many other eateries in the vicinity, with better hygiene, taste, and price.
3
This is one the resturant in little India which I visit with friends ... Food is good, specially the ones which are highlighted in blue color in the menuService is aweful .... No one bothers to ask you for a seat ... Staff are not very friendly ... Only one who is friendly is owner of the shop ... I think he should also look into service part of itKitchen area is not very clean, but it's o
5
If you like North Indian and Pakistani food and don't mind the street food experience then look no further than Usman in Singapore. The Halim, kebabs, biryani and keema will leave you licking your fingers. Come here with an empty stomach and it won't disappoint. And be prepared to work extra hard in the gym after because it's guaranteed you will eat till you can't eat no more :). They have a restaurant in the Arab street area that is more comfortable for families
5
We almost ate there 10 times in our 20 days stay... Gets overcrowded in evenings but the owners are very good at hospitality. Its open sitting, no Air conditioning. The food is super cheap, yet very tasty. Try the Biryani, Mutton and Chicken... and Garlic/Butter Naan. They sell Coke Can for $1, one of the cheapest in SG I found. Try the Mutton Koftas -- really delicious
5
A friend brought me to this restaurant and I was impressed not just by the good food but also the good service and prices! Located at the corner of Serangoon Rd/Desker Rd, it has its regular crowd that still comes even after dinner hours. I enjoyed the dish Haleem (first time) and also our other dishes like chicken tikka, palak paneer, sheek kebab! The staff were friendly and did not hurry us off even though we had finish and there were people waiting. Will definitely be back to try others on the menu
3
We went there as a couple for a quick bite. This is a cheap-eating place, in the lane parallel to Syed Alwi Road where Mustafe Centre is. An open seating, on the corners of one of the busiest roads of Singapore (Serangoon Road) may not be everyone's idea of an excellent meal!That said- this place has decent quality, which can be called GREAT if you look at the prices: Chicken Biryani for S$ 5, Mutton Biryani for S$ 6, Plain Naan S$ 1, Butter Chicken S$ 4, Coke Can for S$ 1.....this place is rally cheap for Indian/ Pakistani food. They also have some "special dishes" which the waiter said are made fresh (as if others aren't!!), such as Chicken Kadhai for S$ 13 (Half plate). Surprisingly, all Paneer (Cottage Cheese) dishes are priced higher at S$ 8 per plate! A warning though, food is greasy and spicy.All in all, a decent tasty meal for really low prices in a "road-side eat" setting...take you pick depending on what sort of a trip you want to make! May not be suitable for a family dine-out

After travelling through Asia for the last few weeks and struggling to find any halal pakistani resturant for a taste of home i finally ended up here after checking on Tripadvisor looked like a place i would like to try and with its positives reviews was looking forward to it.On my first day in Singapore went her for lunch as I had planned to spend sometime after shopping at Mustafa.Got here after asking a local for directions from Mustafa was busy found my self a spot ordered the kofta and nan.Nan was soft and fluffy definatly the best nan I've ever had any where kofta was a bit salty for my taste did feed back this to the owner who was a man from Faislabad in Pakistan.The waiters over there need to be retrained because they have far from adequate customer service skills I did not have any issues but this was from looking at other people's experiences while I was having lunch.After finish my meal off with a masala chai which was divine hit the right spot for me great way to finish a good meal.Went back the next day for lunch again and had the Chicken Tikka Masala this time and it's was great.The owner made me taste a little of the kofta to check whether the salt was ok and it got the thumbs up lol.Great to see he had taken my feedback seriously.Overall great value for a meal good food only missed 1 star from my review for customer service apart from that I'll be back
4
Never refused my friends invitation for a Tandoori Meal. We decided for Udsman Restaurant. Food was fantastic and I really like the Garlic Naan. So soft and fluffy but well baked. I had Keema and Butter Chicken to go along with the Naan. Myt friends had Mutton and Chicken Briyani. Service abit slow but importantly they deliver good food. Its a kind of restaurant at the side of the rood but its clean. Will definitely be bac
4
As many have already observed, this place is a corner coffeeshop, not a fancy restaurant. The location is close to the famous Mustafa Centre. There are very few tables and it is not really a place to come with a large group of friends. The owner mans the till and is patient with order taking. There are printed menus in English and prices are clearly marked.Came by early on a saturday as I've heard that the place tends to get busy and food may be sold out later. Tried the kofta (lamb meatballs) curry, dhall fry, tandoori chicken and naan. Was disappointed that tandoori roti was not available that day (I really wanted tandoori roti). The dhall fry was absolutely delicious and fragrant with spices, as was the curry gravy of the kofta. Tandoori chicken was tender and tasty. Also had a lovely masala tea and bandung to drink. The total bill for two of us came up to $20. Not the cheapest food you can find but good value and very very tasty. I will come back again to try the tandoori roti and nihari
4
This is one is a small  corner side eatery on the main Serangoon Road . We have been regulars to this eatery whenever we are visiting Mustafa Shopping. Our regular orders are - Kebabs (Minced Meat Skewers) and Kofta curry accompanied with Tandoori Roti (Different than Nan). The food always arrive piping hot fresh from the tandoor along with roti's which are crisp . The kebabs are succulent and juicy and kofta curry has the right blend of spices. For drinks we normally order Nimbu Pani (Freshly Squeezed lime juice in sweetened water). The service and ambience of the place can be skipped. The place is always busy and one has to wait in line for finding solo tables. If you are in a hurry one can grab any sharing table  and order the foods.The food prices are reasonable .Overall a great option for a quick lunch or dinner if you are not worried about the ambience and want good tasty food
1
We went here after reading previous trip advisor reviews but when we arrived (2pm - dec 28) the main staffer/cashier was rude and reluctant to recommend dishes to us. He totally avoided eye contact and was very arrogant ( dont know why ad this is a dive) Anyways prices were not clear and to avoid getting a fat bill at the end that he probably would have made up on the spot, we left and went to Mother's kitchen across the street which is amazing and had an indoor decent restaurant set up.
4
At first this restaurant doesn't look awesome to me at all. When I had my first bite of the spicy prawn my impression changed a lot. This place is worth trying
5
The Usman restaurant has 2 branches, the one at Serangoon road is the original one. Great place in the middle of happening, great food and people. Best to go is sunday evening, than you can experience the real life in Singapore's Little india.
4
A small eatery, barely qualifying as a restaurant, standing on the busy Serangoon Road. I had a few times packed their kebabs. But this was the first time I ventured for a dine-in. Of the handful of tables, it took a bit of a skill to find a place......one should be prepared to wait during the rush hoursI had gone there with the sole purpose of eating Haleem ($6). I would not say I was very impressed....for the fact that it looked to me like a daal (lentils) with a mutton flavour. Although, it tasted great but I was hoping to get the mutton fibers in my mouth. We also had the mutton masala ($5) which was good. Chicken Tikka ($4.50) was made to perfection. But the tastiest of the lot was the Roti ($1.30) which we preferred over Naan ($1) and it is worth paying the extra 30 cents as the taste of whole wheat continued to linger in the mouth...washed them down with mango lassi ($3.50) which I thought was pricey as compared to the food.Overall, by the end of the lunch, I was a very satisfied customer. I have been in Singapore for 8 years and it is a pity that it took me so long to visit this restaurant. Of course, the place does not qualify for a quiet meal, but for this kind of price, you realise that the so called fine dine eateries is charging you just for the ambience. I am going again next wee
4
Really good, authentic food. The halim is a must try, however it is sold out often. The restaurant as such is not a great location and neither is it the cleanest. However, for value for money and authentic food, this is definitely the place to go. Service, however, could be much much bette
4
On the corner of Desker and Serengoon, Usman's has become our 'go to' Little India food experience for visiting family and friends. The service is quick and efficient and the food delicious - on this visit we scoffed, garlic and plain naan, chicken tikka and butter chicken accompanied by the ever refreshing fresh lime juice. The eatery is located right on the street which adds to its high energy atmosphere as you sit, eat and watch the world whirl by. A fun evening
4
While the restaurant may not look very different from a number of other Indian restaurants in the area, the food is the real differentiator. We are the keema and it was delicious. The naan for and fresh the whole experience was one of a casual meal that a foodie would enjoy provided the focus is on the food and the food alone. A downside is the availability of space and the waiting time and it may not necessarily be worth it.
4
Usman has tasty food, quick service at an affordable price. We ordered Chicken Karahi, Spicy Prawns, garlic naans and the refreshing lime juice. Not fine dining but if you want to experience the hustle and bustle of Singapore's Little India (very near Mustafa), this streetside location is the place to be. Seating can be a problem during rush hour so come much earlier. (Near Farrer MRT
5
If one can disregard the ambience, this might be the best place to have Mughlai food. I would recommend sheesh kabab and garlic naans, as a must have. I ended up getting kababs packed for breakfast ;) I would definitely visit them again and try other dishes. Located at walking distance from Mustafa, it is a streetside eating joint. Service is okay, can't expect much. Must visit.
5
We were drawn into Usman's after seeing someone tucking into rather delicious looking plate of chicken tikka. Unnassuming eatery with a glass counter to pick your dishes from. We got some garlic naans which were light and buttery. Chana dal and chicken tikka. My husband had a masala tea and I had a coconut drink plus there were jugs of water on the tables. The staff were really nice and smiley and we enjoyed sitting street side sheltering from the rain. Honest, tasty foods at a great price.
5
Food was great, especially their garlic cheese naan! oh my.. every other place we went we ordered a garlic cheese naan in hopes of it being just as delicious. Nothing even came close. GET THE GARLIC CHEESE NAAN, and mail me one while you're it !! :
4
i tried butter naan , keema , tandoori , sheek kabab as well as haleem all are very good. they served hot and very good affordable price ... love to visit again and again
4
Best Authentic Pakistani food in Singapore, actually there are limited choice of Pakistani food in Singapore. Nihari is best item with hot naans.
4
Had dinner there during last week. Great food!!!!!.
Nihari and paya were delicious. Naan fresh and soft. Only con was the seating. We had to sit outside in plastic chairs with plastic table. There were seven of us and had our fill for 54 SGD.
5
Although the restaurant does not have excellent seating and ambiance but the food is just outstanding! This is one of the few Pakistani restaurants in the city and they have pretty authentic reasonably priced food. Highly recommended!
5
I have been to Usman Restaurant for a short rest while visiting Little India. I had a Masala Tea and a Cheese Naan, I don't know how they should taste like, but they were amazingly good! So tasty and really, really good! The prices also were really good, so cheap! The waiters were really nice, kind and smiling! They made sure everything was ok few times!The restaurant it's on a street corner so you can enjoy the Little India spirit while having something to drink and/or eat! Have a try! :

Now here is a place that you will tell to all your friends if you have been there. Its an unassuming little corner take away/sit down type food place that you may not even call a restaurant. But the food is simply amazing. everything is authentic pakistani bbq. The prices are embarrassingly cheap. plate of dahl for $2 ?? plate of bbq $4 - $6 !!!!!! Stuated in little india its easy to find. I would strongly recommend to anyone who is a foody

There are a variety of naans: Plain, butter, garlic, cheese, etc. They are always served warm. The naans are soft, no matter what the flavours are. The 2 best dishes to eat the naans with are Keema and Chilli Chicken. Keema is a dish of minced mutton with peas. It is full of spices and very, very, very scrumptious! Next is the Chilli Chicken on a Hotplate. You ought to be warned though, the smoke from this dish will make your eyes watery before you start sneezing. This happens every single time! It lasts for a few good seconds, so be patient while you salivate before pouncing on it like a hungry vulture! Sounds like a Bollywood movie? You bet!End it all with a good Teh Tarik (Milk Tea) or Ginger Tea. For those who are brave, try the Masaala Tea.Visit my site for a comprehensive review http://bonchjela.com/2012/04/14/best-naan-ever

Whats the point of good food if the people serving you have no manners? I am a Pakistani myself and yet the servers/handlers treat you like crap. Maybe they are people with no understanding of customer service and basic level respect. Really disappointed and even if they are the last place in Singapore to eat wont go there again. Simple

Wandered in by accident on one of our many trips to Little India. Small and basic roadside eatery has great Nihari, (a mutton dish slow cooked). the Dal Fry and the Palak Paneer were excellent! So was the Lahori Kebab which we preferred to the Tandoori Chicken (that was good too). It is rare to find specific regional food like Nihari and Halim in restaurants in Singapore. Most North Indian/Pakistani food doled out by Indian Restaurants in Singapore tastes the same - greasy and insipid including the highly rated Rang Mahal in the Pan Pacific Hotel.I would give the butter chicken a miss and ask for the tandoori rotis (wheat based baked bread) instead of the naan (flour based baked bread); former is way better

I always make a point to eat here whenever I'm in Singapore. I love Indian food and this has got to be one of the best places for some authentic indian food. I love their mutton biryani and the haleem, which goes great dipped in their freshly made naan.Highly recommended
