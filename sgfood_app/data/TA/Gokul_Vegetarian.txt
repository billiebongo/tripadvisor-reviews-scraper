Loved the food here. Service is prompt and polite. A tad pricey when compared to the original versions but the quality makes up for it. Must trys are the Satay, Mee Goreng and Mutton Masala.
4
We prefer non-spicy, vegetarian Indian food and the restaurant served us the same in no time and with pleasant smiling faces even when it was the closing time for them. My husband and son loved this place!
3
Very crowded, service was an issue. Mock-meat does not make the food tasty. It was may be an oil issue or something, but none of us finished our meals.
2
Nice ambience with great food for vegetarians. They almost have every food innvegetarian. Be it Chinese, Malay, western and Indian. We had make a goreng and rava masala.
5
Gokul serves a multitude of Asian Dishes from Nasi Lemak and Mee Goreng to Mutton Mysore and Fried Rice but with one difference . All these dishes are vegetarian.The taste is so authentic that one Friend called the mock mutton he was eating uncannily real.Decor is simple no frills but the service is efficient and friendly and the food is wonderful.What more can one ask for ?Raja Thuraisingha

This is the restaurant in Little India where Jain people can go and enjoy their meal. This restaurant serves only No Onion No Garlic Vegetarian food. Though they use potatoes but on request they prepare food which is completely pure Jain. on my 7 days trip to Singapore and being Jain I had food here for 3 days out of 7. There are many other restaurant in same vicinity which will also serves vegetarian Jain food but not of this quality and taste.There is one more restaurant near Mustafa Center named Balaji opposite to in between of gate no 1 & 2 of Mustafa Center which also serves very good Jain Food. The Manager of the Balaji named Snehal is Gujarati and from Ahmedabad. He is very calm and nice to helpful and understand the need of Jain people

Dinner with friends at this Indian vegetarian restaurant was only satisfactory in the dishes we ordered. This was our 2nd visit here and this time ,the dishes were not appetising at all and fairly tasteless. We had the Indian Rojak, Vegetarian satay with the rice and cucumber, another plate of Chinese Rojak, a big pot of Rice vermicelli with vegetables in broth. All the dishes were delivered very promptly, We could not finish them and had a doggie bag. The last time we visited here, the meals were very tasty and well presented

The sixth star is for honesty! I was here yesterday for take away and didn't realised that I left my wallet there until this morning. Very grateful that they kept it for me, all content intact. As long as you are in business, I'm a customer! You have done very well to have a team like this. Thank you again and to those who found and kept it until my return
5
Tasted the most amazing local dishes in this North Indian restaurant.Ordered a char kway teow and it was so delicious!Next comes the potato curry puff to die for.Had also a laksa noodle n a lontong (A vegetable curry).Complete our meal with a masala tea n bru coffee.It's affordable and they even have a home delivery service.You got to try this place.
5
Very nice food, specially for vegiterian. There are other option also there yet we have not tried. But Gokul was very good.
5
A favourite of mine who has never sacked in its quality and taste. A must visit each time I land in Singapore
4
Good india veg food and feel like in india and crowd is also like india
But food price is little high
5
I wish we had something like this nearer to home, you do not understand how they manage with those ingredients to make such tasty food ... thank you hoe to come back soon
5
Brilliant masala dosa, only SGD 7.50 ! Very clean and cool inside too. No alcohol on sale here, as most veggie places are strictly Muslim.
5
it is another vegetarian restaurant where we can get all cruises . north indian ,south indian , chinese vegetarian ,malay food and dessert . they have another branches but the main in serangoon is the best
5
One may find it strange ,going thru the menu card and see most of the Non Vegetarian food items listed in it. And this is the speciality of this restaurant. They have a large menu of Non Veg dishes like Butter Chicken ,Chilli Chicken including some Malaysian -prepared using only vegetables or other non vegetarian ingredients.The uniqueness is that even die hard non vegetarians cannot complain about the quality or taste.Dont miss to visit if you are in Singapore
5
They have such an extensive menu and every time I order something new I'm never disappointed. The food here is amazing. I ordered some Indian takeout from Gokul for my meat-eating partner (who's quite picky) and he absolutely loved everything and couldn't believe that they contained no animal products. I also love that they veganise food that you usually don't find a vegan version of like fried carrot cake, butter chicken, chicken rice etc. and nail it taste and texture wise. The veganised version of the food here is even better than a lot of the stalls selling the non-veganised version. Amazing
4
We are a family of vegetarians and this was an excellent place to try local cuisine as well as traditional Indian items. The menu was extensive with dosas, Punjabi dishes, noodles, etc. If you're a fan of the fake meat dishes then there are plenty of choices. We got Chinese Rojak, chili chicken (fake meat) and my young kids got noodles and paneer makhani with roti prata. We all ate well after a long day of sightseeing! It is not very upscale but a decent place to check out. Also, the Sri Veeramakaliamman temple is walking distance from here.
3
I had been to his restaurant to celebrate my son's birthday. The experience was so-so but staff need to understand to service their customers. When we were cutting cake they did not bother to provide plates and spoon to eat. When asked they just pass 4 plastic bowls (for six of us).Served the vegetable when the tandoori roti was still in wait
4
An enjoyable meal, especially the mock sardine puff as a starter. Wide choice of dishes and ample portions. The staff were very helpful and called a taxi for us as torrential rain outside. Would recommend.
1
Waiting 30 min even there was plenty of place. Horrible service.
Food poisoning 30 min after eating, i had to go to hospital.
4
Woodlands This is basically a Indian restaurant where food is served without onion and garlic . There is a vast variety of north Indian South Indian . Chinese and Malay food .
5
This restaurant specializes Vegetearian versions of all local south east cusines and singaporean cusines. thai , Malay , Indoensia.It is a Heaven for the prople who wanna try local cusines minus meat.I love tom yam soup and laksa,and other local items.The service is very good and staff is very good. People will be suprised to choose from a Plethora of items in the huge menu.i had a guilt free vegetarian meals version of all non vegetarian items across various cusines.All the items will arrive very fast and quality of items is very high.This is a Must for all vegetarian diners and you will be spoilt for choic
4
Largest Variety of Local Singaporean ( Chinese,Indian & Even Malay dishes) all at one Place & all Vegetarian too! most of these are exact replicas of famous 'Meat' dishes!You will never be able to tell the difference & think that there have Meat or eggs in them.They even have Vegetarian Cakes & Desserts ( All without eggs too) . Although the service is so so but still friendly,as they are nearly packed all the time & it's hard to get a table on weekends! Prices are reasonable & Quantity served is good
4
A local friend took us to Gokul and we impressed with the four dishes that we were served. Being a fully vegetarian establishment, 'mock meat' is used in many of the dishes, and to good effect. Service was fast, portions were generous, and considering it is a restaurant, the price was reasonable
3
The restaurant has an nice interior especially for this area. It is more European that's why my eyes like it. The staff seems in a rush but the restaurant was just half full. The food is good but you can get the same quality just a few meters away for less money. You mostly pay extra for the nice interior
3
Good vegetarian food with large portions. Don't be surprised to find chicken or mutton dishes in menu card of vegetarian restaurant they are mock dishes. We had dinner here two times and had to wait for long time for the food we ordered. I noticed that there is some problem with the service system of the restaurant, funny part was that waiter going table to table with a dish asking have you ordered this dish :) . Prices are reasonable and dishes are good, you can consider this place to dine if you have enough time to spare.
4
Visited Gokul again but this time the one in the Bugis - Fortune Centre.Reminded of the poor choice last time, we ordered Nasi Lemak and Nasi Goreng even after the staff warned me of experimenting as this is the first time I was trying Nasi Lemak. But I was persistent as I wanted to Veg version of Nasi Lemak.Well, the dish impressed me more than Nasi Goreng. This Nasi Lemak had flavoured rice, fried peanuts, mock fish curry, salad, pickle, fried anchovies. Ofcourse all these are mock versions and thoroughly enjoyed, will definitely recommend it. Nasi Goreng was also good but Nasi Lemak is a winner.Ambience - Not much 2/5 (Little India one is better than this Bugis)Food - 4/

Looking at their menu, you would get confused with all non-veg names like chicken, meat, fish, but hey don't worry they are mock and made up of pure veg soya...this restaurant is pure vegetarian, and the best part all their food is cooked without onion and garlic, yet tasting so good...the owner believes in hare Krishna, and so this is one of the best restaurants in Singapore, Little India, I visited with my family. Restaurant interior/ ambience is not very bad either, it's quite decent, but it isn't as good as Kailash Parbat, but Kailash Parbat charges are high and they have very limited choices for people like me who doesn't eat onion/ garlic. Gokul on the other hand prices it's food reasonably between S$ 8 - S$ 12 per item (main course). One thing that I would strongly suggest this restaurant owner is that please stop naming veg food items with names like chicken, mutton & fish, since Vegetarians won't like this at all, I hate to order my veg food saying I want Veg Chicken Fried Rice when I hate Chicken....Secondly, in their menu they should describe the ingredients of food items, since they name it Chicken/ Fish, they should describe that it's Mock made up with Soya/ Tofu. Only for these 2 reasons, I am rating your restaurant 4 and not 5
4
This place has fantastic Singaporean vegetarian food, which they cook with mock meats. Service can be a bit slow when it's busy.
3
The chicken rice and nasi lemak are worth trying. However their indian dishes are only average tasting. The service is a little slow but has improved as compared to my previous visits.
3
On our last night in Singapore we finally ate all Vegetarian. The choices were spicy and flavourful. The staff were efficient and pleasant. Highly recommend.
5
Wide selection of amazing vegan dishes (rice, noodles, veggies, mock meats). I go there at least once a day. Friendly staff and dice atmosphere. My favorite restaurant in Singapore so far!
4
My wife & daughter picked this vegetarian restaurant as we were walking through Little India.We are not vegetarians but decided to give it a try & are glad we did.Nothing fancybut just good flavoursome Indian food with great service & a wide choice on the menu
3
We have ordered Singapore Biriyani and Chettinaad Mutton curry with Butter Naans, after being assured they are all mock varieties :DThe service could have been better, had there been a little help while placing the order, we could have opted wise. Unfortunately both turned out to be similar mutton versions.But overall the experience is good and different, the imitation was so close was difficult to believe it's not real meat.Should try something else other than Indian cuisine next time
4
We went to this restaurant twice, as we found the food very tasty & the staff efficient. We enjoyed the vegetarian Mock Meat Rendang, which our Non-Veg friends could not tell that it was not real meat!! We also had their Chocolate icecream which was delicious. Thanks Pradeep.
1
A lot of people waving waiting for their order to be taken. No one to take orders. Staff on the side updating the system when it is full.is this how you guys work? One person on the phone. One person clearing table refusing to take orders. Horrendous. Service 0/10 food: 5/1

I've been a fan and frequent patron of this restaurant since its inception, and used to marvel at how delectable pure vegetarian food without onion & garlic can be; and being a pure vegetarian, I'm particular about visiting only such eateries. I'd proudly take every visiting family member & friend for a meal, and they loved it too. I'd use to refer to Gokul as being 'world famous in Singapore'.Unfortunately since the last two years Gokul has been adding garlic to their food and this can be easily detected by people who follow a strictly no onion & garlic diet usually for religious reasons. I brought this to the management's notice a couple of months back; they apologized and promised they'd look into the matter and rectify it.However, this morning, my mother and I ate dosas at their Fortune Centre branch and the sambhar was loaded with garlic!Given that the restaurant advertises itself as one that's strictly vegetarian, without onion & garlic, it's unacceptable that they're adding garlic to their food to make it more palatable for those who're accustomed to eating it. Please be aware of this, especially those who strictly adhere to a no onion-no garlic diet.Sadly for me, I'm not going to visit this restaurant again in future :
3
Very interesting veggie take on local Malay , Peranakan delicacies and I throughly enjoyed it .The sore points were the pathetic service and taking me for a fool by serving the same tea they had wrongfully served and calling it Teh Tarik !! Fails as a complete package but the food is pretty good
5
love the food....must come for local indian asian malay fusion food. bought some tiger balm...very good oil for ache and pain
1
so i asked her to give me one roti paratha, becaused she asked one or two, after i give her the money, she threw the receipt at me. soo rude
4
Immediate seating even though the establishment seemed near full. water supplied then orders taken for Grokul special noodle dish, Hokkien Mee, Mushroom Kurma Alou Gobi. All tasty and cooked to perfection. Sensible vegetarian dining at a reasonable price. Service good.
5
During our last week trip, we went here twice. Food Is really tasty here. Being totally veg restaurant, it is a must go for all veggies. its managed by only 3 staff people, but service is extraordinary fast, whatever you may order...
5
If you are local, try their indian cuisine, if you are indian try their local cuisine, i have to say they really know how to cook.
4
One of the best India vegetarian restaurant in Singapore! With one stop at this restaurant, you can taste the best of india, malay and chinese local delights! Believe it not, i find many of their Chinese local dish better than the Chinese restaurants! The price is reasonable, however don't expect too much of service level. Their main branch is at Upper Dickson, the largest vegetarian menu in SG! Sub branch is at Fortune Center (Bugis)
3
On first impressions the menu was quite impressive. It's pure vegetarian with a variety of fake meat dishes, a combination of north and South Indian food, and even noodles.Service was quick, and I was given free poppadoms whilst I waited, though no dips were provided.I ordered a Masala dosa, which consisted of huge chunks of potato but sadly not much flavour. There was also no flavour to the coconut chutney (which is my favourite) which was a real disappointment. The restaurant was clean and tidy, though no wifi is available. Will try something different next time
4
I stopped in here for lunch. The menu seemed quite extensive and looked quite special. Many patrons in for lunch. To be honest I was quite tired and hungry and just not really very awake when I dropped in. The masala dosai I ordered was OK, I had no complaints. The Chinese vegetable plate was good, vegetables were not over overcooked or too oily and fresh if unimaginatively spiced and presented. There was a good amount of ginger in them and that seemed to make me feel much more refreshed after the meal. I wished at the time that they had real coffee instead of instant. Service was prompt enough and friendly, I would drop in again for a dinner and try out other items on their extensive menu
4
Best laksa goreng I have eaten! Chicken rice is also good. Murtabak tasted better before. Overall food is really good. But be prepared to leave overstuffed and feeling really heavy! Good variety of menu. Staff are abit unbothered and u gotta get on their head to call them. Food comes in 15 mins after order.Ambience is average. Recommende
5
Although not a vegetarian, we liked the look of this restaurant in Little India so went in! Great choice of dishes and non alcoholic drinks- all served with no meat, no eggs, no onions and no garlic. I was dubious about getting decent flavours under those conditions, but I was proved completely wrong. Mushroom kurma was delicious, naan bread was light and aloo something was really flavoursome. Friendly people too - Would definitely go again and recommend to all
4
Wide range of Indian,Local,Indo Chinese,Continental dishes.Prices are slightly higher than surrounding restaurants.Quality is good,portions are large,sitting ambience is good
5
In Singapore and held a short business over lunch at Gokul. The food was truly lip-smacking and the variety was huge and diverse. I ended up ordering extra to take back to my hotel for dinner. I can't recommend the place more highly.
3
Restaurant is located on upper dickson road.
Ambinece is good. Service is also good.
I had veg food it was tasty
4
I had masala dosa here, which was so tasty.a selection t ion of curries which were also amazing. Portions are large. Give the masala tea a miss, it's not too special.
5
This is a great place that I frequent for quality indian/malay/Chinese vegetarian food. Highly recommended. Quality is high and waiting time is short.
5
It is a very good restaurant for vegans, they have extensive menu and along with Indian food they serve local and Malay dishes like laksa, nasi lemak, satay etc. We ordered laksa, nasi goreng and channa bhatura, the food was good.
4
It's been two years since I turned vegetarian, my non-vegetarian craving was satisfied after visiting Gokul.I tried mutton sukka (chukka), nasi goreng, panneer for starter. Nasi goreng was particularly spicy but I loved mutton sukka! It tasted as good as the real deal. Though it is on the pricy side, it is worth a visit
4
Little India in Singapore has ton of eateries and restaurants, vegetarian and non-vegetarian. There is a hidden gem that serves up good mix of Indian and Asian flavors for both Carnivores and Herbivores – GOKUL Vegetarian Restaurant.Bringing along with me is a non-local lovely young lady to feel the vibe of dining in an authentic Indian vegetarian restaurant in Little India. Also to taste the insanely delicious vegetarian food. It was a week day night, yet the restaurant is packed with diners. Is a night that I enjoy the crowd. Laksa Goreng ($8.5+) is a fusion creation, Laska in Hokkien Mee style. Toothsome! Yet to find another eateries that dishes up Vegetarian Murtabak ($8+), so I forgo the temptation of other dishes on the extensive menu.Northern Indian Food, Bee Hoon Goreng, Soup Kambing … I will come for it! A basket of papadum was served (on the house). No service charge and plain water is free flow
3
A local Singaporean took us to this restaurant as she knew I was vegetarian . Although you can easily eat this way in Asia, it was nice having some food made specifically for my taste. The food was a little on the sparse side in quantity, but delicious nevertheless. Restaurants are never cheap in Singapore and a meal was $ 45 SGD for three with no drinks. The down side was the poor and even surly service. Although our friend said this is not unusual in Singapore, I was very dismayed considering the friendliness we had experienced at food hawker stalls. This place is in Little India
5
Gokul is great. It’s situated in Upper Dickson Rd in bustling Little India. The menu is huge and it’s so good to be able to order anything and know it’s vegetarian. We had 2 pre-teens with us – neither of them overly adventurous eaters – so we played it safe and ordered a bunch of simple starters (samosa, spring rolls, paneer pakoras and satay sticks) and 2 mild mains (vegie kurma and malai kofta) plus plain rice, naans and mango lassis. Everything was good but the servings were quite generous so it ended up being way too much food. The kids liked it so much they asked if we could eat there for a second night during our week-long stay in Singapore. We ordered fewer dishes on our second visit and left pleasantly full. The service was fast and friendly, even when the restaurant was crowded. We would definitely become Gokul regulars if it wasn’t an 8-hr flight from our house! Highly recommended
5
I went twice, during the short period I stayed in singapore, and both where wonderful! The claypots are very yummy, and the palak paneer was the best i ever had...
5
During my recent visit to Singapore, I have experienced the best food available outside India, Gokul is located in Little India (Singapore) and serves tasty appetizers and south and north India dishes along with refreshing drinks.
5
The best vegetarian Indian food in Singapore! The food is very addictive and there sooo much variety on the menu which left us spoilt for choice. The ambience and set up is decent and the service is excellent. The prices are reasonable too.
5
One of the best meals we had in Singapore. My brother is vegetarian so was in heaven. The portions are large and the mock meat is actually pretty tasty.
4
My mother follows strict vaishnav rules and it was tough for us to get her the food . To our surprize we got this one where we could get jain food as well . The taste was also good
4
Have made a few trips for lunch, each visit was welcoming. Staff have been trained, providing good service and are attentive. Staff even made an effort to seek feedback if everything's alright and if the food is to our liking. A variety of dishes to choose from their menu, North Indian, South Indian, Asian... drLoved their Hyderabad Dum Briyani Claypot, Nasi Goreng Kampong and Chicken Rice. Some starters worth trying, Gobi Manchurian and Crispy Paneer Pakoras
4
This restaurant is located in Upper Dickson Road off Serangoon Road.I have been coming here for more than 5 years.They have maintained the quality.This is a vegetarian restaurant.No onions or garlic used.They serve a wide variety of soya based dishes.Dont mistake it for meat.It is mock meat.Tastes superb.For travellers from North India the soya chaap is nothing compared to this place.Must visit restaurant.Service is fast and efficient
5
Well. I was amazed. I am not vegetarian but my daughter is a vegan so we were busily trying to find good places to eat (having found some not so nice places). We ordered the vegan 'mutton' and some spicy 'chicken' rice with some side dishes and it was delicious. Initially i thought i had made a mistake and ordered meat by accident,to be reminded that it is all vegetarian. The staff were friendly, efficient and helpful. Definitely would recommend thie wonderful plac
3
online we had researched the place, and it was close to our hotel, so we popped in for late lunch on saturday.. , the crowd was sparse..the menu is pretty vast, we ordered a dosa, and tom yum noodles soup and paratha.. food was good,, and for us jains its very convenient as it doesn't contain onion garlic..the portion size is big.. decently priced.. all is good.. only hitch are the names on the menu..even with full knowledge that its not real sea food or meat.. one feels a guilt while ordering it.. or may b we r just more orthodox..i guess its easy to digest the words..jain sushi rather than the name mock prawn fritters.. hmm
5
Loved the variety of tasty vegetarian food served at this outlet. Though small in dinning area it is definitely a good place to have vegetarian food. The only thing that bothered us was - the toilet and hand washing area --which definitely needs some upgrade for a place that has such good food
5
Menu start from indian, chinese, melayu, western..make me want to return here everytime while I'm visiting singapore just to make sure tasting all kind of food they have
1
The menu seems to serve a lot of food but the taste of the food is average . We really thought we could have a real satisfaction of mock meat and we miserably failed .
5
the mock food which looks like non-veg food is really great to taste and yummy !!! butter chicken and roti is must try . rose milk is also good & mutton is also good .
4
Friendly service, a huge menu of vegetarian stuff with chicken, fish and meat dishes made from soya (you wouldn't really know the difference). Has afternoon dosa here along with freshly squeezed juice. Nice basic place!
3
We were recommended this restaurant by a family friend who suggested we go and try something different. The menu is extensive with lots of dishes that seem to be meat, but in fact were all made from different forms of mock meats of soya. The food was pretty good and the chicken rice was yummy. Drinks were a mixture of juices, mocktails and coffees & teas. The service is nothing to write home about and neither was the cleanliness. However, if the line waiting outside and the constant patronage was anything to go by, then a lot of people come here regularly as the majority of the clientele were locals living in Singapore. Pretty good value for money. Would consider going back next time we visit Singapore
5
Been to Gokul's multiple times.Kudos to their replicas of original non vegetarian food.Their wanton me is yummylicious..with a big generous serving that can be shared among 2. It has wanton..char siew and of coz its all mock meat..Their chicken rice is just another must try dish..chilli being spicy and tasty..Another must try is the nasi goreng kampung topped with anchovies..Though their dishes are pricey..the portions served are generous..Gokuls..is my fav haunt when i crave for non vegetarian during the days im fasting(vegetarian dishes only).
3
When we walked past Gokul earlier in the day, a friendly Indian traveller emerged with her two daughters and told us she ate there whenever she visited Singapore. However, at dinner that evening we found the restaurant to be drab with indifferent service and dishes that were mostly bland
1
The photos on this site itself show mutton kheema, prawns tandoori, chicken etc in the menu itself how do you call this vegetarian.I would call this deceit.I was seated and never provided with food for 20 mins on a lunch time.I never ate there I just had to leave
2
My sister, a vegan, raved about this place. Although I'm not vegetarian let alone vegan, I love Indian food. So we have it a try. Apparently, they've changed their recipes according to our waiter who has been there for several years. Food was not up to par and some items were discontinued. I had the aloo gobi, palak paneer and roti paratha. Aloo was ok. A bit mushy. Palak was tasteless. I've had baby food that excited my mouth more. The roti was ok but I've had better. Service was a bit lacking and we had to ask for some things more than once. One positive note is the prices. A bargain for Singapore.
4
Hopping around Little India or even if not, this place can be in your to-do list while you're a toruist in Singapore. I was craving for vegetarian Indian food for few days and lastly I dined at Gokul. The place is easily to locate, not on a big road but definitely in bustling surroundings. I visited on Fire Walk day, so roads were full of people. I enjoyed my meal. Naan and Lassi must be on your list if you're here. I can definitely return on my next visit. Cheers! to the team
4
Good & mild Indian food, but bit expensive. can improve on service / delivery front by taking prompt orders. Also providing password for free wifi was a task.
5
Awesome food,nice ppl,great cakes,all kinds of cuisines,limited variety,but it's a oasis in desert of non veg food
3
Suitable for vegan, but portions are far too large and its expensive too. The names of the dishes say chicken, mutton, sardine, etc.. .when you ask the waiters / servers if the place is really vegetarian, they silently point to the poster about the Gokul History or the name of the restaurant! It would have been better if they said Mock Chicken, Mock Mutton or something... sheesh
5
Gokul is a somewhat unique restaurant. Located in Little India, it has bright dining areas and low-key modern decor (simple walls, floors, tables, ceilings, and lighting – with simply mounted and hung graphics to enhance the mood) rather than a heavily ethnic vibe found in many other area places. Its menu contains over 500 offerings. Although considered to be Indian by many, the founder is reportedly Singaporean and the kitchen reportedly with several Nepali staff; one can order complete meals of non-South-Asian dishes courtesy of its extensive menu. It's food is generally moderately priced, though drinks seem more expensive and can considerably drive up the total cost of a meal here.Gokul is reportedly introducing delivery - to anywhere in Singapore. It has a special delivery menu (some of its 500+ regular menu items may not pack or travel will). Charges depend on distance from the kitchen. I haven't tried this option - and would probably prefer to travel in to the restaurant to maximize kitchen-to-table flavour retention.I have eaten here on a couple of occasions. On both occasions, the sheer diversity of menu offerings presents a challenge. You are at risk of over ordering without realizing this at the time. Indeed, my second bit of advice (the first being to go easy on drinks if you are pushing for value) is to order simply and moderately – and order additional dishes if and when you discover you need or want more food.Gokul has a number of “mock meat, poultry, seafood” dishes. As some Chinese restaurants texture tofu to resemble chicken skin or other, Gokul does this with several of its South Asian specialties or other. Along with the spicing, and overall preparation of the dishes, this fooled several culinary experts in our party, who did not realize that they were in a veg place.I see a couple of critiques, that garlic and onion are not used so the food is not tasty. Well, there are some folks who cannot enjoy food which is insifficiently fatty, oily, salty, sugary, etc. Thus the high profits for low-grade fast food restaurants. There are folks so used to high chili levels in everything they eat, that rich spicing that is low in chili content is tasteless. Yes, some tastes may not be satisfied here (as everywhere).Popular food blogger HungryAngMo(.com) has long considered Gokul to be the best veg restaurant in Singapore. I am far less travelled around the veg offerings of the Lion City. But I could probably agree – and perhaps consider it the most enjoyable eating establishment, veg or not, that I have been to in Singapore. Not cheap, but good value (if you go light on the drinks). Pleasant ambiance given over to the dining experience.You have to put some thought into Gokul's extensive menu. If you do this successfully, you should have a fine meal
5
My friend in Sg observes a strict diet, and with a craving for Indian food, my friend decided to bring e to Gokul in Upper Dickson Rd. I remembered my craving for Beef Curry and thought I wouldn't enjoy it as the meats are "fake" meat. I had a Cheese Prata while my friend ordered quite a selection including tamarind rice.Decided to try alil of the dishes with my prata and my eyeballs just popped out. They were amazing flavours. I helped myself and had as much as I could. Truly satisfied, I should tell you. The mango lassi could have been better. I have had better lassis in Manila. Eitherway, the manager recognized my friend as a regular and offered us coffee or tea, which we refused to. He stretched out his generosity by telling the cashier to give us a discount, which was very kind a gesture. Left the place with my Indian food craving satisfied.
4
My Finnish mate brought me there as he loves Indian food. At first thought, I was slightly dreading it as it is a vegetarian place but it changed my mind completely! We had the cheese dish and it taste so good, some mock meat that taste like good proteins. Stuffed our face too and it changed my mind so definitely going back again
3
As Vegetarians we went there with some excitement having been told by a friend that it had the best all-round Vegetarian cuisines in Singapore, under one roof. The menu reveals that it does do Indian, Singaporean, Malaysian and Indonesian dishes. HBut, they are better off sticking to the Indian. Our Malaysian dishes were quite ordinary in the Maggie noodle class.d And, we thought that it certainly wasn't a bargain to pay SGD 28 for a meal for 2, of this "quality". They did not even have a couple of dishes we wanted ("Rojak" - for instance)All up if authentic Vegetarian South East Asian food is what you are seeking, do not go here.
4
Armed with information, we decided to eat at Gokul Indian Vegetarian in Little India for our first night in Singapore. The place was full of customers. We were hungry and dived straight into the Tandoori plate, lassis and some naans. The Tandoori was ok, but we should have tried some of their curry dishes instead. The mango lassi was really nice, a bit pricy but we did go back for a second. The waiter was very friendly and even gave us some curry to try with our naans. We also tried the Char Kway Teow as recommended and it didn’t disappoint

It is a unique place in Singapore as it serves all kind of food from the region. So you can have Indian food, Singaporean laksa, Indonesian nasi goreng etc. All the food is really spicy so ask for mild if you don't like it hot. The staff is friendly and helpful so ask for advice

I was a little confused with the name of the hotel "Gokul Vegetarian" and the items on the menu, as they had so many non-vegetarian items on it. Later I learnt that its pure vegan hotel. Most of the items were Soy (Tofu) based. Tastes really awesome. Must visit !!!

Great Menu. Great taste. Great price. very well located in the heart of Little India. We dined there for a couple of times. Food was great every Single time

Great food and really good prices. Some different dishes that I had not had anywhere else. Highly recommended

We go to Gokul a lot. The food is good and it is very good value for Singapore. I love the dosas in particular. Customers are a mix of locals and tourists. Go early or expect to queue later on.

This is one restaurant which i dont miss on my visits to Singapore.It is off the main Serangoon Road and a close walk from Mustafas.They serve only vegetarian fare here.The mock meat options are the best you can find.The dosas are good.This place is a must visit

Since we stayed in hotel 81 Dickson,we had to pass through upper Dickson road while going to Mustafa shopping areas.One weekend, I entered GOKUL restaurant and found it very crowded and managed to find a small 2 seater table in a corner The waiter gave us a meny which was very big and thick resembling a photo album.While entering, I noticed that many diners were having non veg dishes bu the the restaurant proclaimed itself to be a vegetarian restaurant. the waiter explained that those were mock meat dishes most probably made of soyabean! The menu contained many South Indian,North Indian as well as Chinese(?) dishes We ordered two masala dosas which indeed were very delicious but a bit costlier than dosa we had taken earlier in Banana Leaf Apolo restaurant but not tastier!

Was staying at a hotel on the same street (Dickson Road) and by chance found this restaurant, not even knowing it was vegetarian! Was delighted with the choice of different foods: Indian, Chinese and Malay/Indonesian - all without any animal part/meat or fish. I ordered Indian vegetable dishes the first night, ordered a bit too much, but it was excellent. Ate it all, but did feel a bit overfed ! One dish was a mixture of vegetables on an iron platter (sort of Korean style - but then they use it for meat!) with a lovely sauce. Delicious. Also ordered a Thai soup Tom Yam (I was warned it would be slightly spicy) but it was much too spicy for me, unfortunately, as it also tasted lovely. Returned a second night, and had other delicious dishes (slightly less - and that was plenty too!). If I did not choose the "Yes" for one of the best meals I ever had in a restaurant, it is not because it is not good enough (or something like that) but have been to Michelin starred restaurants in Switzerland, hence it is a different kettle of fish. However, I will say that it was the very best vegetarian restaurant I have been to (I have limited experience in vegetarian restaurants, I must admit). Staff were most friendly, as the owners who seemed to be present. I would highly recommend it to anybody who wants to eat an excellent vegetarian meal, given the choice of cuisines. There are some very nice deserts too

This is my all time favorite restaurant in Singapore. It's quite pricey, so I normally visit their Fortune Centre eat-out place which serves some of the popular dishes from their menu at 70-80% of the price at their fine dining outlet. I have tried many of their localized, veganized dishes, all of which have a very unique taste. My most favourite dish in Gokul's is definitely their Sambar rice. They serve the best sambar rice you'll probably ever have. Some of the other noteworthy dishes are their tandoori items, murtabak, prata. Hungryangmo has rated this as the best vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. So that should tell you something about this place! do visi

If you miss having a good Char Kway Teow, this is the place to go. Our non vegetarian friends thought it weird that we ordered non Indian dishes at an Indian restaurant. If you have not have had a decent vegetarian Char Kway Teow for years, then order that. It doesn't disappoint despite not having garlic and onion to give it a kick.They boast to have the largest menu selection on the island and I think they are right. From Indian, Chinese, Peranakan, Malay to pastas and pizzas. Of course there are superb Indian food elsewhere, but Gokul serves an excellent choice with great taste.On the outside, the place looks good. However, the inside is like a cafeteria. Hence, we tend to expect to pay less. Dosa range for S$7-S$9. All other items, including their local fare is S$10-S$16. We tend to spend on average $20/person. That's because we tend to over order.Service isn't bad and they sure know their extensive menu well. Just expect to eat quick and go if you are visiting on a weekend

This joint has it all,AMbience,excellent food choices,and well groomed and informed staff.There are more than 400 dishes displayed in the printed menus.South/North Indian ,Chinese(including Peranakan)Malay and some Eurasian dishes.All the dishes are 100%vegetarian.NO eggs, Not even onions and garlic are used.The food served is quite attractively placed on banana leaves which are then placed on CHINA plates.Even if you were to try 1 main course a day,and partake in a meal a day,One year is insufficientto go through ALL the dishes in the MENU.You may have your food spiced according to your degree of pungency.The way to order(for non-solo diners) is to request for different types of main courses and thenshare those dishes(this used to be called 'COMMUNAL EATING' in olden CHINA.)i.e.4 of you have a chance of trying 4 different dishes at one sitting.They also serve a variety of sauces-always try as many sauces-this time around, try 6 differentsauces and stick to the ones which may suit you.You might mix and match your own sauce with a dish which NORMALLY carries a sauce completely different from the one YOU have selected.The ingredients used are rather quite fresh and no 2 masalas are the same.The drinks list has an exotic(all vegetarian/fruits) flavor.Remember- there is NO repeat NO MSG.The Masala/Ginger teas are also a delight.Altogether, this place is priced quite reasonably for the type of food served.The restaurant also does catering for outside functions.P.S.It was first started by one of the two brothers who was a CHIEF-STEWARD with SINGAPORE AIRLINES

I would rate this place number 1 in Indian cuisines. Good taste. they provide best quality food. Best value for your money. Yummy experience. Staff is also good. service is fast. it is one of the few vegetarian places in Singapore because you will get non-vegetarian food mostly on all the restaurants.
5
Pros:
- very friendly, responsive staff
- elaborate menu with pictures for all dishes
- quick service, tasty dishes (okra and biryani particularly good)
- good value for money
- sparkling clean neighborhood restaurant
- can request less/more spicy according to taste
Cons:
- nothing!

Always packed so try to avoid peak hours or take away. Enjoyed the fried rice & mutton curry. Do ask the manager or staff to recommend food choices as they do have some specials at times

My wife and I were taken here with my brother in law. If you have been to Singapore before you will already know food is a major factor and past time of the culture. So as a fan of indian and chinese food we were taken to Gokuls. This restaurant used mock meat and ingredients to reinvent local hawker food for the vegetarian community. We had the Crispy Cereal Prawns, Char Kway Teow, Carrot Cake, Nasi Goreng Kampung and Chilli Chicken. The Nasi Goreng was very very good. Although if your taste buds are unfamiliar with mock meat than try a smaller variety first. They do a range of south indian dishes as well as Pizza etc. I would definitely try this restaurant for the Local vegetarian take on the cuisine as its worth the experience. This place also gets busy to be prepared to wait and the service is also very good and quick
4
A wide menu of excellently flavoured vegetarian dishes. That said. Some are better than others. The dhosa masala was disappointing, but their signature biryani was lovely. I would have like a the opportunity to have a half dish of something. A whole dish of saag aloo is too much as a side dish, but smaller portions were not available.Loved the fresh Lemon grass juice.It was disappointing that they did not have the South Indian meals in the evening. Highly recommend
4
When comes to spices, the qualities of the culture food are the Best! This not the 1st time I ate Indian food, but this place serve you good Indian food.and don't Miss-out the Lemongrass Juice very..tasty.The staff are nice but need to add more smile on their face

We came to the Gokul Restaurant in Upper Dickson Street on the strength of the reviews we had read – but our experience was a little bit disappointing. We were there in the evening and had anticipated ordering thali meals – but Gokul doesn’t serve thalis in the evening – strange. I had a masala dosa which was good but I have had better in India and elsewhere in Singapore – but full marks for cooking everything without onion or garlic. My wife ordered a side order of bindi (a favourite of ours) – but this was unfortunately undercooked – and as readers will know, bindi (okra) is in the category of potatoes and eggplants – if not cooked perfectly they are all virtually inedible and certainly unappetising. The drinks were good - fruit juice and mango lassi. The restaurant is spotlessly clean but lacking in any atmosphere – very utilitarian and plastic. Service was a bit slow – appeared to be understaffed the night we dined there. The menu is comprehensive – but really only ideal for group diners who can order a number of dishes to share. If you are on your own – you are restricted to the likes of masala dosa – so I would encourage management to introduce thali meals in the evenings

This is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore every time I land here since it has all the local foods, only vegetarian and sattvic (no onion, garlic). Being a vegetarian, I am typically cautious of other restaurants which serve meat and it is not easy finding a restaurant or eatery that does such an amazing job with creating local food without losing the taste. My favorites are Char Kway Teow, Chinese Rojak, Tahu Goreng, Indian Rojak, Satays and the list goes on. They use mock meats as well and having been a non-veg before, I can tell you there is very little difference in taste...and the food is so much healthier...no hormone fed chickens, cows or sheep that car...In addition to local Singaporean food, it has a huge menu with Naans, daals, sabjis (vegetable dishes). Don't forget to try the Ginger tea. On special occassions, I know my family caters from them too and they do a great job with the quality and quantity of food

On my vegetarian days, I visit Gokul for their interesting vegetarian options. They have quite a good variety of Asian vegetarian food like Nasi Lemak, Chicken Rice, Roti John, Rojak. Service a little slow but if you are not in a hurry, this place will do

I was very tired and hungry and looking for food and drink in mid-afternoon. When I entered the restaurant, I was encouraged at my selection as most of the tables were filled with Indians obviously enjoying themselves. I ordered a vegetarian curry dish, naan, and a mango lassi. It was just what I needed to replenish my energy and my server was very pleasant
5
One of the best meals I've EVER had, hands down. Came with 5 other girls, we all split food and left full for about $8 SGD each! We had daal, naan, butter chicken (OMG), mutton masala, and a couple of other dishes that I can't remember the name of. I couldn't believe everything was vegetarian. I'm a meat-lover and never thought I'd enjoy a vegetarian meal this good. Everyone from my group enjoyed it as much as I did. I wish I had a Gokul back in the states! I would go every day
4
Very good value. We had dhosas, which were delicious and with generous servings. The restaurant does not serve alcohol.
3
Simple vegetarian restaurant serving nice array of foods at reasonable prices. Only had two dishes but both were nice. Food that other diners had looked good.
5
Got the South Indian thali and it was amazing. The mango lassi was decent but at 6 SGD, overpriced.
The thali comes with different food everyday but on the day i went it included mock mutton curry, tofu paneer, and bhindi masala, all delicious.

It is a restaurant off Serangoon road (upper dickson road) in little India. The ambience is pleasant, staff friend. service efficient, but whats really amazing is the variety there serve. I have frequented this place for a while now and the reason is simple - the quality is maintained and usually unmatched. The food is really tasty (even though its vegetarian) and its not very high on fats or spices so its really a pleasure to eat! Popular among the locals, it multi-cuisine serving north indian, south indian, singaporean, malay food among others. The mock meats are really good. Adhering strictly to the old traditional principles of Satvik food the food doesnt not have egg, onion, garlic or Msg. Though I have tried most of the items on the menu, a meal without masala dosa and/or sheek kabob along with the ginger juice is incomplete. Sometimes they have really nice cakes as well.The food is reasonably priced. Do give it a tr

Strolling on my own through singapore India Town on a Sunday evening, I looked for a suitable place to diner and of course took tripadvisor as my guide. Though not vegetarian, even far from being a teetotaler, i stepped in for a Veggie experience and seriously, I was stunned by the tastes. What a discovery for me, always having linked vegetarianism with a dry dull lump of tofu. Really a recommended place, even for the more meat friendly travellers
5
Not just Indian veg dishes, but a menu full of veg versions of Chinese and Malay dishes too. Went twice on our last visit to Singapore, so many dishes to choose from and all the ones we have tried have been delicious. Love their mee goreng

Gokul's is conveniently located at Upper Dickson Road, near Little India Arcade. Being a vegetarian, I have tried eating at numerous Restaurants serving pure vegetarian cuisine (no egg) the primary difference between other Vegetarian Restaurants and Gokul's is its unique Menu, which carries all varieties of local fare, such as Nonya Laksa, Char Kway Teow (yummy), Rojak, satay, and other dishes which are not available at other ethnic Vegetarian Restaurants. The ambience is also very good although not posh. It has indoor and outdoor dining facilities. Three of us ordering about 5 dishes plus drinks costed us less than SING$50.00 - good value for money

My non-veggie bf and I visited Gokul in December and were very impressed with the massive range of dishes available, covering most of the spectrum in terms of Asian cuisines. In 20+ years of dining in veggie restaurants I've never seen a menu that could match it. Being accustomed to only having one or 2 options it was a little overwhelming to have so much choice! We over-ordered a little as a result and had leftovers which we would definitely have taken home had we not been flying out that afternoon. The dishes we had were: nasi goreng, satay, "mutton" kheema and the romali roti set. All were delicious but the kheema got top billing with a lovely savoury flavour and just the right amount of spice. We had been warned that the nasi goreng would also be fairly spicy and were not disappointed. If you're not a chili fan then I would suggest avoiding but if you are then it's a great version of one of my favourite Indonesian dishes.For veggies who are keen to try a range of Asian dishes that aren't often an option for us in the region I would highly recommend a visit to Gokul. It also got a big thumbs up from my non-veggie bf. We will most certainly be back next time we're in Singapore

I've been eating here on and off for years. The food is vegetarian-only, and some of the dishes are fantastic. The menu is rather epic, so it can be difficult to choose, but I would definitely recommend the palak paneer. Staff are friendly and it's good value.

We were a group of stoic people with a good mix of vegetarian and non vegetarian. The food was really horrible. Even the vegetarian bunch in our group did not like it. One must ne aware that the food is without onion and garlic, so may be jain people may like it. For the rest highly not recommend. Moreover food is pricey
