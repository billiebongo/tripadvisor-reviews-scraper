Service is so-so, but the food is definitely above average. Located conveniently at Marina Bay Sands.
4
Great quality. Sashimi was fresh and impeccably cut. View at MBS was breathtaking as well. More on the expensive side though.
3
Limited menu but food is very good order seafood mostly as chicken dishes are nice but too fried good food and service
4
Food was okay service was efficient, had a nice time there with a nice view in the afternoon. Food price isn’t cheap though.

Probaly the best sushi/sashimi i had in my life.I am not an expert in fish quality, but i can tell you that it was the best sashimi i ever ate. The staff was friendly and smilling, witch is important in restaurant business. The smiles on the face of waiters is becoming more rare these days specially when you are a foreigner in Asia.I give only 4 stars because some things could be improved in terms of food.The meat was good (crossbreed wagyu), but not good enough to eat it without sauce, and the sauce was not really good. But overall it was a great meal that i enjoyed.Thanks

My wife & I stopped in for lunch today; unfortunately only one of us ever received our order. The waitress was friendly enough when we first sat down, bringing us our menus and then asking what we wanted to drink. My wife asked for a Perrier (SGP$6) and I ordered a draught Sapporo beer (SGP$15). We received our drinks in short order and then we both ordered bowls of soup. I then told the waitress that I would hold onto one of the menus because I would order more (probably sushi) after we received our bowls of soup.My wife received her bowl of seafood soup in short order, but the waitress left without saying a word to me. While I was waiting for my soup, I had decided to place an additional order for a couple of nigiri items, but the waitress never gave me the opportunity.Ten minutes later, after my wife had finished her bowl of soup, I began wondering whether our waitress had forgotten about me. I could see her on the other side of the restaurant, but she never came back to my table. After another 10 minutes went by, with both my wife and I just sitting there with no food, I finally hailed another waitress, told her I never received my order, and asked her to just bring me our bill. She was apologetic and then went to the other side of the restaurant to speak with our original waitress. A minute or two later, the second waitress came back to our table with my bowl of soup. When I asked her what had happened, she really didn't have an answer, except to once again apologize for me not having received it previously. I advised her that I didn't want it now, and again asked for my check.. She took the soup back, brought me my check (with the charge for the soup removed), and then we paid and left.Although I would normally rate the restaurant one star for this lack of service (not to mention lack of food, lol), my wife told me that the bowl of seafood soup (SGP$9.5)she ate was the best bowl of soup she's ever had. So even though I didn't get to eat, and my mug of beer was hideously overpriced, I will grudgingly have to give the restaurant an additional star for my wife's soup, bringing the total rating up to two stars

Had a dinner at this place and wasn't satisfied. The only item which was ok was cod fish. Rolls were average, fish didn't seem to be fresh. Rolls were falling apart when you pick them with chopstick. It's definitely expensive for what you get. You are paying for the location and not for the quality of food
4
Chanced upon this place and decided on it because of the scenic location. Food-wise, wasn’t quite sure what to expect, but the sushi turned out well and worth the price. Am speaking as somebody who’s had experience with esteemed sushiyas.
5
We ordered the fish carpaccio, Chirsashi Sushi and Premium Sushi set. The fish was really fresh and the sushi was balanced with just the right amount of rice with the seafood. The uni was very creamy and the scallop was extremely succulent.For dessert, we had the mille crepe. It was very soft, unlike the slightly frozen ones you typically get elsewhere. The cake was not too sweet and rounded off the meal very well
2
Food was below par. The standard was well below expectations for the prices charged: salad leaves were wilted and I’ve had better sashimi at places that don’t charge as much. The service was so-so and a number of items ordered had run out by the time we started ordering at 8pm
5
Nice food and also good atmosphere there, not crowded place :) Location also perfect.
I will come back again.
5
Really nice suchi and nigiri. Service was good. We had starter and 9 pieces of sushi, 5 rolls and 2 beers each the price was 334 SGD for two.
5
Nice food. Love the Beef Tataki, the premium nigiri sushi and the carbless roll. Service staff is thoughtful and politely.
5
We are expats living in SG. We have many choices for sushi here, so we try them all. If you want fusion or gainjin sushi and sashimi, or want a fancy or entertaining restaurant, then skip Sen. But, if you want want a great view if Marina Bay and the tastiest and freshest fish outside of Japan and Taiwan, Sen will be your new benchmark. Selection and price is above average. Portions relatively tiny, but expected once you taste them. After experiencing the Zen of Sen, it's going to be difficult finding anything better tasting in town.
4
Waku Ghin tops my list of Japanese restaurants in MBS without a shadow of a doubt. Since it doesn't entertain walk ins in the main dining area and is quite a lengthy dining experience, Hide Yamamoto is my defecto choice for a quick and good meal.Chanced upon Sen, which serves very decent quality fresh sashimi and sushi, though the selection is rather limited. Highly recommended is the chawanmushi with uni and truffle.
5
Having been to Japan and experiencing the food there, I never thought I could find Japanese food like that in Singapore. In terms of freshness, SOJ is superior to most of the Japanese restaurants in Singapore. I had the premium sashimi platter, and it was excellent. The fish was so sweet and soft; really tasted like what I had in Japan. Another dish worth commending was the wagyu don. 5/5 would come again.
5
It was highly raved among my friends and I've been recommended Sen Of Japan (SOJ) numerous times, and boy, it was definitely worthwhile.I was greeted by their passionate and courteous service staff and they brought me to my table. Tried a few recommended dishes by the waiter, the premium sashimi platter, wagyu don, black cod soy and ikura chawanmushi.The Wagyu Don is one of the best I've had in Singapore. Food quality was excellent and definitely worth every single dime spent here. I'll not hesitate to come back here again
3
We waited next to the “Please wait to be seated” sign and someone came along to greet us after 5 minutes. It was a sign of things to come.We had the 10-piece sashimi, chawan mushi, grilled Yellowtail cheek, Inaniwa udon, beef tataki and hot ocha. Other than the unconventional uni and truffle flavor chawan mushi, everything else was average. We unfortunately did not eat anything that impressed us enough to want to return.
5
Thank you for the complimentary crepe cake and candle! The food was very fresh and absolutely delicious. The sashimi platter and carbless roll were spot-on!The filipino waitress was warm and friendly, she also sang a birthday song for my surprised friend. The restaurant overlooks the city and the waters. Thank you once again for the nice celebration we had at your restaurant. We will surely come back again
3
Chawanmushi was delicious but everything else we tried was just ok . Nothing we haven't eaten before and done better.Brûlée was just a custard .I guess if you just wanted Japanese food for dinner then this will suffice but it's nothing special .The worse part was as we were eating dessert they started grilling garlic lobster so there was a very strong smell of garlic 
4
The tempura, black cod soy and careless rolls were flavorful, fresh and authentic. Highly recommended :)
5
So delicious. Great service. We had lunch - sashimi, gyoza, sushi, miso, edamame... ok price considering Singapore relatively expensive in general. Would visit again!
5
Food here was really great. Sushi was fresh and of premium quality. Atmosphere was nice and all the staffs were friendly. Special thanks to Jaycee :) I had a wonderful night with my family!
5
Casual dining. Good food. Friendly service staff especially Color
Visited many times , specially memorable during national day celebrations. Good spot to catch fireworks
3
One of the new changes to the F&B options at MBS, this restaurant is by the waterfront. Other than offering a view, the food and service failed to impress.
4
Visited on a weekday with my family, it wasn’t crowded so we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. Initially, we were worried that we wouldn’t be satisfied with no bento/donburi/ramen category on the menu (I think this is an Asian mentality, really ) but we’re glad that we were proven wrong. Had the gyoza, chicken karaage, pork belly, black cod, sashimi, and sushi rolls, and our tummies were so happy! Both the gyoza and chicken karaage were fried to perfection, the pork belly was so tender it falls apart in your mouth, the black cod was full of flavour, and the plates of tuna and salmon sashimi I had were so fresh and the portion I was given was generous. The sushi rolls were very well made too. We finished it off with the matcha creme brûlée that came highly recommended, and it sure didn’t disappoint. The creme brûlée was smooth and the black sesame ice cream that accompanied the dessert was an absolute pairing to balance the sweetness. Will reconsider a return visit in the near future
5
Have been to this restaurant quite a few times and it is definitely my go to place for good and reasonably priced Japanese food. Food - Premium grade sushi and sashimi are served in generous portion sizes. The cooked dishes are also very well done and delicious. Ambience - Very nice ambience in the evening, allowing diners to overlook the Marina Bay. Perfect for a romantic evening out. Service - Top notch service, food arrives very fast and the service staff are always attentive ready to assist in any needs that you might have
5
Every culture has their own traditions and styles when it comes to eating their own types of cuisine. When you set out to eat authentic Japanese cuisine, do head straight to Sen of Japan located at the 1st floor of MBS. WORDS ARE HARD TO CONVINCE YOU GUYS. LET MY PICTURES DO THE MAGIC
4
Food here is delicious and good. Like the black cod soy, beef tataki, chicken gyoza, Wagyu steak, carbless roll - All must try!! Yum!! Staff are super friendly and helpful. Thanks to Color, Ellie and Ivy, had a wonderful meal and time at restaurant!!
3
For the price I paid, I'm expecting a much better quality of food. Environment is abit noisy and the service staff is not attentive. Need to call a few times before I get notice.
5
Good view with good quality food! Very excellent cuisine!🔝we recommend salmon kuradon and nigiri!
The staff is very friendly!
4
Good Japanese food with view on Marina Bay. I tested the Premium sushi 9 pieces. Great!
Also appreciated the nice and efficient service.
5
Comfortable location near garden by the bay and art science museum, high variety of Japanese kitchen dishes including own original ones, fast service and polite personnel.
5
Had a wonderful dining experience at this restaurant. My favorite was the black cod, scallops carpaccio and the green tea brulee..
Superb service from Ellie and Jaycee. Highly recommended!
4
The lunch sets are a very good value and the quality has also been maintained which is a bonus! Would definitely visit again though I would choose a less busy time.
4
Three of us had an amazing meal here. Miso soup, black cod, wagyu beef, tempura prawns, sushi to name just a few. Food was really delicious and fresh. Would be nice not to feel so rushed at the end of the evening. When the staff already changed for going home collected our plates and were already mopping the floor. We appreciate they need to go home but surely they could wait till we were finished
5
Prob the second best sushi I have ever had. Amazing. Try the carbless rolls.Happy hour beers $8. View of the light show and fountains.Service was great even charged our mobiles for us while we ate. So good! A lot of the restaurants in Marina Bay Sands Shoppes are pricey. This one is reasonable and worth every penny!
5
We have dined at Sen of Japan a few times before and the food has always been good. For this visit, we had the ebi sushi and salmon carpaccio with Kirin ice cold beer. The beer was served perfectly on iced glasses so it remained cold as we worked through the food. The salmon carpaccio was a real delight and the sliced tomato amazingly sweet. The ebi sushi portions had just the right mix of rice & filling. Service was great too so it was a pleasant experience
5
Had a pleasurable dining experience with my partner at Sen Of Japan today. The sashimi was exquisite and fairly priced and the taste of their umi chawanmushi kept me in a state of perpetual surprise with each bite i took. The staff and servers provided a very homey dining experience for us with the right balance of professionalism and friendliness. I would definitely visit this gem of a restaurant again very soon
5
It was a pleasant afternoon and decided to come over for dinner after viewing the exhibition at the nearby gallery. The staff were accommodating and enthusiastic on recommending items on the menu based on their favorites. Truly you can trust these server because all that were served to us are delicious! My friend and I had two rounds of the same platters we initially ordered.The sushi rolls are exceptional given its reasonable price and wide selection of makis, nigiris and sashimis. The freshly-grated wasabi was a bomb!Good job on your team Ellie
5
I had an amazing dinner date night with my girfriends! Finest selection of food, friendly and nice service, great ambience.
4
I had the set lunch which was really value for money. The environment was really great as it's facing the Singapore river. The staff are very friendly. Will go again.
4
The ambience is nice n comfortable.
Staffs are attentive & friendly.
Food is unique & yummy.
Worth to come
4
The atmosphere is nice and service staff are friendly. Also, their weekday lunch set is worth to try.
4
Was here with friends so we shared Makis and Nigiris and other things. All fine, all nicely presented. Highlight was soft shell crab maki. Decent sake selection. Good for a meal before going to the theatre, for example.
4
Simple dishes with good quality ingredients.Eggplant with sweet miso was so nice, it's charred properly and the sweet miso is champion. Black cod was so delicate with simple sauces and red peppers. Seafood soup used this very deep flavor of bonito. However out of nowhere chicken karage was dry and a bit burnt
5
Although not the cheapest in town, this small Japanese restaurant located in Marina Bay Sands, serves a good selection of sushi, sashimi and cooked dishes. The raw fish is very fresh while the cooked ones delicately prepared. Even the desserts are prettily embellished! Do try their maki rolls, amazing creations that taste great! Service is good as staff are always attentive and willing to serve
5
The maki selection offers a blend of flavours that go together really well. The salmon aburi roll was something refreshingly different and I really enjoyed how the different textures and taste compliment the torched flavour.Green tea brulee topped with black sesame ice cream to end off the dinner, an unique combi. Not to mention, the team of helpful yet friendly service crews. KUDO
5
This place is AMAZING! The sashimis are not only fresh and of premium quality, it is reasonably priced too. If there is a dish that makes me keep coming back for more, it would be the Ikura Chawanmushi (loving how they added truffle oil to the egg, which is super tasty!) Not forgetting the stunning night view of the Marina Bay landscape, defintely a plus point for superb dining experience (great place to bring your date too!) definitely will be back again!
5
The food was really good, service couldve been better but I thought they were nice and tried their best. All in all, it was the perfect place for our pre-theatre meal. And those are important. So despite us squeezing dinner into a quick hour, all was good! Try their maki rolls!! (
5
Fresh sashimi at an reasonable price tag to the items. Other than sashimi, dishes were well prepared. Would strongly recommend ppl to try that place.
3
Food quality is average. Service is good. Friendly and patient waitresses. Restaurant environment is pleasant.
3
Limited menu offerings likely to be related to the location. Food was ok but expensive considering alternative available elsewhere. Premium paid is for the view of the city which was great.
4
The food was very nice and fresh. The beef was tender and oysters were very fresh. Like the food vey much. But it is a bit pricey for the portion served.
4
Very good Japanese restaurant at a very short distance from Marina Bay Sands. Big variety of excellent and freshest dishes, nice view too. Good service. The interior is a little bit too simple.
5
Situated along Marina Bay, this restaurant got the best view of the CBD. Came here with a friend for late lunch and bento servings are generous and affordable. It's ambiance is bright and staff are accommodating. If you're looking for fine quality Japanese food without hurting much in the pocket, this is the place to go to.
4
Well we were sort of tricked into this place with a written sign outside for cheap beer - turns out what was on offer was very small glasses of beer at eye catching affordable prices - these were only available in happy hour and were finished very quickly. Cannot remember the price but think they were 200ml draught.Having said that, we got looking at the menu and there were other drinks that were fine for Singapore prices, so we changed. Then we looked at the food and it looked amazing, so we stayed for dinner too.Stars of the show were the Carpaccio and Sushi, closely followed by Gyoza - food was 5*, but the drink took this review down by 1*Located in the Shopping centre (The Shoppes)Staff were great too
3
Reasonable food, absolutely mediocre and unattentive service, ok environment and sky high prices. That is what Sen of Japan is allAbout
3
Despite the emptiness of the restaurant the food was very good. We had the sashimi salad, chicken gyoza, the truffle ankake chawanmushi, chicken karaage, the baked oysters with spicy aioli and the black cod soy. All the food was good except that there were large bones in the fillet of cod. The staff did not handle this very well. Overall the waiting staff let down our whole experience. Perhaps it was just a bad day or she was a family member but if you don't want to be there, don't be. There's nothing worse than a waitress or waiter with attitude. This coupled with the emptiness of the restaurant didn't make it a great experience, which considering how good the food was (excdept for the fish bones) is a shame. Unfortunately we are unlikely to revisit
5
We started with the truffle edamame (generosity on the truffle oil is commendable.. very pleased) as well as the ikura chawanmushi which came with a slab of uni. Both appetizers were flavorful. Our assortment of sashimi which followed is fresh and of optimal thickness too! If you're looking for a quaint Japanese restaurant with a genuine Japanese taste, I highly recommend this restaurant. You get what you pay for, if not more
5
Enjoyed the food and the relaxing ambience. Will def come back again for their otoro, black cod and truffle chawanmushi.
5
On the edge of the M B S Shopping Center this small Japanese restaurant produces very high quality food at correct prices. We had an assortment of 16 pieces of Sashimi all almost 1cm thick. Very flavorful and meaty. We also had Wagyu Tataki perfectly sliced and marbled, Seaweed salad, Excellent and some fried Chicken Karaage which was moist, tender and full of flavour. Unlimited green te
3
Sen of Japan told us by phone (much later after i found out i did not receive chope points after booking and dining there) that they cannot give us the chope points unless we must buy preorder voucher.Chope did state that i can get the points when making reservations but buying preorder voucher. Other than this, food is very fresh. For The Promotion we only order 1 item each pax at $1 value
4
It was my first time that I had complete Japanese food. We had food photography session organised in this restaurant. The ambiance is too good along with bay front view.The food was delicious, I enjoyed Maki Roll, Sashimi and juicy grill chicken. Would definitely visit again
2
Brought my here for dinner one night and saw there was a promotion for their chuutoro and ootoro. Proceeded to order the ootoro and was told it was out of stock so we settle for the chuutoro among other things. Sake was good, and sashimi in general was of good quality. When my chuutoro came,it looked like regular maguro and I thought the waitress had gotten my order wrong. Upon querying, she had confirmed that it was chuutoro. I was not convinced. So I ordered a portion of maguro for comparison. That's when things got interesting. When my order of maguro came,it looked EXACTLY the same as my first order of "chuutoro".However, my portion of maguro came along with the sushi chef(Chinese guy),and with the limited English he spoke, he tried to explain the difference between maguro and chuutoro. He then proceeded to draw a picture of what looks like a fish and trying to explain where the different parts of the fish are. I decided not leave the matter to rest. I'll post a picture of the 2 different pieces of tuna and let u decide for yourself. Word of advise to the establishment,don't sell premium cuts of fish on promotion if you do not intend to honour it
4
If you’re looking for Japanese food near the bay, hear you are at the right place.From Wagyu to Sushi, all we ordered was tasty and nicely prepared. With one exception: The Salmon Aburi Roll was covered with mayonnaise – what a waste………..Try the Dragon Maki – my favourite! Good to know if you are on your own - They serve wine by the glass.The service was ok
4
The Sen of Japan is located outside of MBS Shoppe which provide a nice ambience for dining. The food was superbly prepared and presented articulate. Although it pricy it was value for money in terms of quality. ambience and services. One should give a try to experience it
5
We went there on a weekday lunch and find the restaurant pretty full. It's best to have reservation. Quality of food is excellent and sake tasting available as well. Price is on the high side though but with a view and situated in marina bay sands, the price is expected
4
 Food was of exceptional quality. Unfortunately most of the aircon were not working. Staff made up by seating my family and me nearest to the working aircon.
4
Sushi, sashimiand other Japanese specialties. Bar and cafe setting on top of Marina Bay Shoppes facing the bay. Food is delicious and reasonably priced. Service is spotty - every table I saw, including my own, had a problem with the soy sauce on the table (container empty, no small bowls for the sauce, etc)
4
Very nice dishes - ordered snapper special, sashimi platter, truffle chawanmushi, and cod fish. All were very fresh and yummylicious. will definitely go back again. the view is also great btw.
4
Great Food, recommended dishes include Snapper Special, Filet Mignon Tataki, Sweet Miso Eggplant, Kinoko Karaage, Chicken Karaage, Black Cod Soy and sushi, maki roll.
Prices a little steep though
5
Found this place as were were outside Marina Bay Sands Shopping complex. Managed to get a table with a view outside at the giant pond with lillies in. The food was fantastic as was the service. I would definitely recommend this place. Seemed to be a vfew locals eating here too
5
We had been looking for a good sushi around Asia. We had a few tries and a lot of misses. Then we stumbled with this one by mistake. We ended up having one of the best sushies of our lives. We ate tons of different sushi's and nigiris and all the fish was astonishingly fresh and it just melted with great flavour in your mouth to round the whole thing, the sake was a beast. It is somewhat expensive (we paid 160 SGD) but nothing you don't pay for other inferior places around town. Totally recommended.
2
The Good: Good view of Marina Bay. Reasonably priced for food.The Bad: 1/ Ask for rice with our order. Charged at $3.00 (I'm OK with this) per bowl, but what was really a let down was they served unseasoned rice -- which if they are going to use the tag line "Sen of Japan", really was unforgivable. Not vinegar rice that even the most basic Sakae Sushi would have served. 2/ Rice was on the verge of going bad. A half decent line cook could tell by the smell it was going bad but they served it anyway. Surprised that the servers, and even the chef would allow it out of the kitchen. Second Big shame. 3/ Advertised "A4 Wagyu" beef. While it was reasonably marbleised, there was too much fat at the sides, and a little tough at times. I doubt if it was actually A4 -- more like a B4 grade. If it was in fact A4, then the chef did a poor job in bringing out the superiority of the meat. Certificate showing beef grade, which is usually displayed in Japan, was not displayed anywhere. 4/ The restaurant had eager-to-please wait staff -- but they weren't well trained. In Japan, or good grade Japanese restaurants in Singapore, the wait staff are usually busy cleaning cutlery or wiping tables, when not busy (we went there about 5:30pm). Instead we saw them loitering around, some on their phones -- as a result missing a few attempts by us to get attention.Knowing the impeccable standards of the Japanese, I would be really surprised if this was a Japanese owned establishment
4
Sen of Japan is a great choice for Marina Bay Sands. Situated along the promenade with views across Marina Bay it's a lovely restaurant for lunch in particular. Food was good, service was ok. If you're after Japanese in this area Sen of Japan is a good option.
4
This is a very good value Japanese restaurant considering where it's located. Sen means 'fresh' in Japanese and all the food we've had has certainly tasted this way
5
Quite a satisfying meals here. My other half like the food here and she loved the Ikura Chawan-mushi so much. The sashimi platter was nice.We were here for lunch that was making us suffering a bit due to the bright sun light. Curtain needs to be a little thicker to protect patron from the sunlight. My other half was coughing bad that day, one of the restaurant captain was approaching and even giving her concern and inform us what type of cough syrup would be good for my girlfriend.Great food, great people
4
My husband and I went to Sen of Japan at Bay Front to try the promo 50% off Wagyu Steak on a Friday evening. We chose the Bell pepper sauce in medium done. The steak was fresh, soft and tender to bite. As it was happy hour we ordered two glasses of red wine too. We also have Asparagus salad come with cucumber and some vegetables with onion dressing. Freshness is the word we conclude for the salad. Tasted the Kaisen Roll which has scallop and some prawns and topped with salmon roe and yuzu dressing. We are happy with this choice too except the prawn is quite hard to bite. Ambience is soft and conducive for quiet and enjoyable meal. Cost of our meal is about S$110. Reasonable for the quality of food and locality.
5
Foods served were excellent and delicious. The freshness of the ingredients used. Presentation of the food were great too
