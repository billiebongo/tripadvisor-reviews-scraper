Had the Golden Sauce crabs amongst other dishes tonight, and it was as tasty as before except that the crab wasn't as meaty as we would expect. Overall a very pleasant dinner
5
I ordered crab with the creamy pumpkin source. It was so amazing dish specially when u eat with the bun. Prawn in wine soup also good. For dessert , need to order coconut signature one. I really recommend this resturant

Visited Chin Huat Live Seafood for the first time as recommended by another friend. We ordered one pepper crab but sadly the crab itself did not have roe in shell (though we knew it's not guaranteed). Also it's not acceptable that the claws were a little bit hollow with much meat and some parts also hollow. We expressed our dissatisfaction to the staff who cancelled the dish for us. As the first impression was not good at the end and there were lots of similar restaurants in town, I might not come and visit this restaurant again
5
Meeting up with friends after an absence of 40+ years requires selection of a memorable restaurant - got that spot on with Chin Huat. Were fortunate enough to get a private room, and everything thereafter got better and better. The food was faultless; seafood is truly exceptional, as is the suckling pig. Choice of wines to complement these dishes and the first class service made the whole evening and hence the re-union event a total success. Cannot recommend this establishment highly enough
4
We pre ordered their signature suckling pig (SD$180). It was really very crispy and flavourful. We ordered the Boston lobster with mee hoon. They chose a 2kg size lobster which was quite adequate for 6 of us. While both the claws are big the flesh inside seemed to have strung to disappointingly 1/3 the size. Really an anti climax and they were lacking any taste.The double boiled chicken soup was very good and we each got quite a good portion despite ordering only one pot to share. The angus beef which each was giveb a sizeable piece was very well tendered and deliciously done chinese style. Overall was a good dinner. As member we got a 10% discount. I know their hor fun is very very good as I tried it previously but we did not order for this round.Need a reservation otherwise be prepared to wait or come after 8:30pm.

We wanted to bring our overseas relatives for a very good seafood meal. So with great confidence, we booked a private room in this highly rated restaurant. Imagine my deep embarrassment when we encountered terrible service - no one came for the first 20 minutes after being seated - we had to walk out of our private room countless times to request for tea, sufficient seats and table settings, to order our desired dishes from the menu, etc. The tea was served 30 minutes after the order was placed. When the dishes were served, they arrived within seconds of each other, in spite of the obvious fact that our table was laden full of dishes and there was no way we could consume the food before they turned cold. We had instructed the Kitchen to halt cooking additional dishes until further notice, but to our horror, the steamed fish and roast suckling pig arrived and was left to sit quietly on the side table. To top it off, the steamed live prawns and fish were over cooked. We felt very frustrated that no one was looking after our dining needs and requirements. Our dirty plates were not changed and the sauces accompanying each dish were missing. After such an unsatisfactory experience, who would want to ever return to be thus tortured

We have occasionally been visiting this old established seafood restaurant in the HDB heartlands over a number of years and as expected prices have increased.Sri Lankan crabs cost slightly under $70 a kilo and most of the crabs are around that size, too big for two persons. We liked the crab to be steamed with just Chinese wine to bring out the freshness. For vegetables, we ordered kangkong (water convolvulus or water spinach) best cooked with sambal belachan. The venison (deer meat) served on a hot plate was tasty with spring onion and ginger. Service was adequate on a weeknight as the restaurant was not too busy. Some staff were able to speak reasonable amount of English. Dinner for three persons with three dishes, rice, a bottle of beer and Chinese tea amounted to around $100. But after adding the cost of peanuts, moist towelette and service charge of 10 pct plus GST, total bill came to $122

Chin Huat is still popular. About 3/4 full on a Sunday at around 7 p.m. Haven’t been here for almost 8 years. Not because of the quality of food but they couldn’t handle the crowd and we had waited for 45 minutes for water to be served. Luckily it was our aunt and uncle and their family.Well, we decided to go back for fried rice with crab meat and shark cartilage soup. Unfortunately, both were not good. Shark cartilage soup was weak. The worst we have had. As for the fried rice, they might as well call it steamed rice.Disappointing to say the least. Will I go back again? Very unlikely
5
I love the House Specialty Pumpkin Sauce Crab and Fried Salted Egg Eggplant. The crab is fresh and the sauce blend in well with the crab. You would crave for more of the sauce and eat it on its own too! As for the salted egg eggplant, it is one of its kind which I do not see it elsewhere. Those who do not like eggplant would definitely make a change after eating this. Everything else is not bad too. Give it a try
3
Was given the VIP room due to the birthday occasion but nothing was working in the room. The tv and system were all down. The food took very long to come and the seafood is over priced. I can only say the seafood is fresh but the way the food is handled and cooked is disappointing. There is nothing to wow about to be frank
5
9th time here, for a birthday dinner, and the food has been consistently good. was during a weekday so it was not as crowded and we were able to get an indoor seating.
5
8th time here, food is consistently good, prices are rather reasonable compared to a full restaurant, service staff standards have improved tremendously, will definitely come back again.
5
First time trying. Fantastic "Pumpkin Crab"! One of their specialities. Crab cooked with "pumpkin and salted egg gravy". Excellent. The kids loved it. Adults too. Also not salty and goes very well with the bun.
Strongly recommended!

Was a very tasty meal huge servings and a good price service was very fast to nice friendly staff and clean

This is a large and popular local seafood restaurant, with spacious outdoor seating. The gentle lady owner graces most tables with a warm hospitable smile and makes you feel at home. They have private rooms. It is generally noisy and busy, with servers in a hurry to get the dishes to their tables in time. The food is fresh and well prepared. We had Steamed Soon hock fish, which was very tender n done just right. The Crispy fish skin with egg yolk was yummy but too salty. The Dumpling bun with khong Bak was flavourful but too salty too. Their Dungeness crab with black pepper was rather dry. I felt that this meaty sweet crab could have been better appreciated cooked another way. The pumpkin crab was delicious and well balanced. Hor fun had good wok hei. Loved their young coconut with pudding dessert.
5
Been here with few long-time-no-see friends but we had a super good fresh Singapore chili crab. The atmosphere was quite and everyone around was talking with low voice just enough.Then I came back here one more time, enjoy the pepper crabs with Guinness beer, unforgettable moment & experiences.

The restaurant was located at the ground floor of a HDB block. There was indoor air con and outdoor non air con dine in area, as well as private room. The place was packed and a bit noisy.Braised Ee Fu Noodles with Mushroom 鲜菇干烧伊面 ($11.80)The flavourful golden brown egg noodles was made from wheat flour, braised to perfection and served in dry style with mushrooms.Flavourful stir fried dish.Golden Sauce Crab 招牌黄金蟹 （南瓜汁）Seasonal PricingThe signature dish was created by Chef Niun Hock Leong and was the number one must try dish on the menu. It was served with deep fried buns ($1/ pc) which tasted when soaked up the rich creamy sauce.Hong Kong Kailan 香港芥兰 ($16)Crunchy vegetables.Home-made Beancurd with Special Sauce 家帝豆腐 ($24)A simple and nostalgic taste of home, made with chef's special sauce, served on a bed of chef's daily selection of vegetables.The beancurd although deep fried, was soft in the mouth.Steam Fish Hong Kong style 港成䒱魚, using Parrotfish 青衣鱼 Steamed in superior soya sauce, this method of preparation retains the natural flavours of the catch, allowing one to fully appreciate the tender flesh of the fish. The fish was sweet and meaty but it came at a high cost at $130.Vegetarian Fried Rice 斋炒饭 ($11.80)Fragrant wok-fried rice, tossed with chinese mushrooms and carrots.Look not bad.Roasted Chicken 脆皮烧鸡 ($24)The meat was tender and flavourful.Crispy Cereal Prawns 香脆麦片鲜虾 ($48)Crispy fried prawns coated with flavourful cereal bitsLike that the prawns were served de-shelled, with the cereal bits crispy around.Coconut Pudding 椰子布丁 ($7.80)A chilled silky-smooth pudding made from fresh coconut flesh and juice. It was served topped with a scoop of coconut ice cream. The pudding was light and smooth.For 2 tables, the bill came up to about $1008, which sounded a bit expensive considering the number of dishes ordered

Chin Huat Live Seafood located at 105 Clementi Street 12 Sunset Way Residence 12 this is a pleasing neighbourhood seafood place. Down-to-earth and not somewhere u want to bring someone for a classy meal. Anyway if you are crab lover like myself, this place is great! It's the best quality crab meat in Singapore. Crabs are always super fresh, sweet and moist. We also had other dishes, and they all were scrumptious. But if u want great quality crabs in a pleasant no fuss environment then this is the place. Service was prompt given the fact that the restaurant was very crowded. .. We had a truly delicious meal which was very reasonably priced. The food was of excellent quality. The service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. I shall return

There’s a lot to love about the not-so-humble crab. Singaporeans will travel to great lengths searching for the perfect plate.You know the fish is fresh when you can spy it all glistening in the cases up front. At Chin Huat, bountiful seafood tanks packed with live produce tempts you on arrival. The menu extends to a full carte with lobster, elephant clam, bamboo clam, Dungeness crab, prawns, shell items. The pumpkin crab features the sweet and refined earthy flavor of pumpkin all umami thick, and orangey-yellow creamy, accented with tender crab meat. Second best is the stir fried crab with salted egg where the salted egg creates a lovely golden crust – crisp and rich.Whether you’re craving a simple clam or an ornate plate of crabs, this is one of the better seafood restaurants in Singapore. This is the true truth as I say it as it is

If you like seafood, Chin Huat Seafood Restaurant is one of the place that you must give it a try. This restaurant has been functioning in the Sunset Way eating outlets for many years. It serves a variety of seafood dishes and our family enjoy very much the pumpkin crab dish as it is a dish that once you have tasted you would love coming back for more. Besides the Pumpkin Crab, the Chilli Crab is another dish that you must not forget to try. Steam fish is another dish that you should try. If you need any assistance the owner cum manager Amy is always present.Chin Huat Seafood Restaurant has survived all these years is because it uses good imported seafood and the selling price per dish is reasonable and affordable. It is always very crowded especially during weekends and if you are coming to the restaurant for a meal it is best that you call and make a reservation for both a table and the dishes that you would like to have. The most popular ones such as crabs, fish and prawns tend to go off very fast.The restaurant have both tables in the open as well as under air conditioned.The place is friendly to those who are physically challenged and to children.Parking can be a challenge at times although there are a quite a number of lots around the vinicity. Try to be there early to avoid having to wait for parking space. There is no valet service
4
Crabs are big and delicious. Coconut ice cream dessert is a must. Try the beef hor fun and champagne ribs too.
5
We enjoyed a delicious feast of Chilli & Pepper Crab with both steamed and Fried buns. A most amazing experience.
5
I had a great dinner over here..
I love their live Sri Lanka Crab v Golden Sauce..
Which is creamy and good to goes with fried buns..
Must Try !!
2
The fish was very chewy and cold. Secondly, the bamboo clams were revolting because the clams were pre-cooked. Thirdly, the asparagus were not cooked enough but at least the dessert was great.. would I EVER come again...... No not until you guys fixed the problem.
4
Second time there, very packed as usual. Took some time to get seated even with a reservation. Took awhile to order as well as only certain supervisors were able to take the order. But food came out very quickly, and the food was good. In general, service was v friendly, though they did look a little disorganized at times (grabbing a supervisor to take the order was quite challenging on a weekend night), while food was awesome. Would come back again

Went to our favourate restaurant for family gthering. Located in a nice and quiet neighbourhood with ample parking, the restaurant offers both indoor aircon and al fresco dining. We enjoyed several signature dishes in Cantonese, Teochew and local style of restaurant standard but at Zi Char prices with no corkage charge! No wonder the restaurant was nearly full even for Sunday lunch
2
We went on a Saturday afternoon at 1pm. There were 24 of us separated into 2 tables, of which 1 of the 2 tables had vegetarians. Service- The waiters wrongly sent (1 out of the 3) vegetarian dishes to the wrong table. After we enquired about that veg dish, the waiters insisted that they had delivered to our table already. We eventually found it at the other table, done and dusted. The waiters declared that they've delivered the dish anyway and not their fault. No apologies from them. This was after 4 of them confronted our table insisting that they have placed the the veg dish correctly. Food -The steamed prawns were chewy. Our chrysanthemum tea had yellow/green food coloring in it. The fried fish was over cooked and the meat was tough. Overall, an unpleasant experience. Perhaps we came at a wrong time.
4
This restaurant is inside a nice small HDB estate right next to a landed property estate so you do get a good mix of customers. Food is great and you can get some discount if you have their membership card.Roast piglet and generally all the fish and seafood dishes are pretty good. Service is good. But don't expect a 5 star ambience. It's pleasant but not your fine dining place if that is what you are looking for. Good place if you just want to enjoy good seafood without all the frills
5
Celebrating for some friends so the usual booking of a big room, red wine and white wine and champagne corkage . Had the fried yam cake, it was thick and crusty . Wonderful. Red wine spare ribs was delicious followed by asparagus with xo sauce, slightly spicy for one of the diners. Followed by lobster bee Hoon, it is so good. Ended with the golden sauce crab. It is not salted egg but pumpkin sauce so less sinful.
4
Living in the East where there are many seafood restaurants, Chin Huat in the West offers teochew style dishes like cold crabs. Most of the dishes we had from soup to lobster noodles were good. I especially liked the coconut dessert which was a nice way to end the meal.
5
Loved the crabs at this restaurant. Very firm and sweet! We had black pepper crab and crab beehoon. Prawns in golden(pumpkin) sauce was very tasty. The homemade beancurd was excellent. Only problem is the noise level.
4
Excellent seafood and Chinese dishes. Service could improve somewhat.
Chilli crab, pepper crab, yam ring, beef hor fun are my faves.
Don't forget reservations as its packed!
5
Enjoyed the fresh seafood and innovative coconut desert. Great service and also very comfortable setting. Keep it up!

Visited this restaurant for the second time yesterday. I specifically liked the Yam Ring with Seafood which I enjoyed during the previous trip. However, when I ordered the same thing this time, the portly waitress assumed I wanted the non seafood version and sent me the one with chicken instead. When I pointed out the mistake and said I was allergic to chicken, she insisted that I accept it and curtly said, "Cannot be exchanged!" It was only upon intervention by a male colleague of hers that I had it changed later to the seafood version which I had wanted. Upon asking for the check, I was appalled to find that they had billed me for both versions! Good thing I checked. Needless to say, it will be a long time before I'll visit this restaurant again. The price here is rather high considering the standard of service, the food and the decor. We paid $176 for two persons.
5
The crabs here are always super fresh and juicy. We love the pepper crab over the chilli crab here. But of Coz would be happy to eat both just that there was only two of us. We also tried the chicken w cashew nuts and dried chilli - very good. Been here quite a few times and it's never disappointed. Staff were also pleasant. Will come back again for sure
4
I have dined here twice for business lunches and I was very impressed in both cases. I would not hesitate at all to eat here again and to try dinner. Both times at lunch I selected from the fixed meal options and was very happy with the result. I think the price was $12, which is an amazing deal for the amount of food (I could barely eat it all) and the quality. Well-done
4
The family decided to have a gathering and decided on this place. We found the food just perfect. We tried both the curry and pepper crabs. The bamboo clams were my fav. The yam and chicken were also very good. Personally I do not like yam, but, this place has done a good job in changing my mind about yams. We wanted fish, but they were sold out and the fishes in the tanks were too small for 15 people.The durian desert was so yummy, not too rich and yet the flavor is still there.The staff were most attentive. Polite and if you are not sure what to order, there is this gentleman (with blond hair) who will go through the menu with you and ask how you want your dish to be cooked, like, if it is boiled, stir fried, and so on

Let me tell you this; there is no other place I would rather eat incredible local freshly cooked chinese food than Chin Huat Live Seafood. This establishment has definitely scored as one of my favourite places to eat local Singaporean and Chinese cuisine.We found this enclave of great food accidentally. We lived nearby, and after just travelling 15 hours back our holiday in the UK, we were starving and in the mood for a bit of local food. We came across Chin Huat and decided to give it a try, because you know 'Why Not??'. An hour later we were stumbling out of the restaurant, with our bellies full of rich, succulent and deliciously fresh chinese food. What a joy!What first struck us was the serenity of the restaurant's location. Next to a bustling Clementi Road and a busy HDB block, it was quiet, peaceful as we dined surrounded by nature. After going a few times (in rain and out of it), it is definately worthwhile to book a dinner table outside at around 6:30 before sunset on a rainless day. Therefore you can catch the sunset over sunset way (no pun intended) whilst stuffing your faces with incredible food. The restaurant is large with an inside and outside area, and there is an extended awning which can shelter you in rain (best when not raining, as you can see the sun set).The food. I was brought up in Asia, lived there most of my life, and had a wonderful time, so I have been exposed to a huge variety of different flavours and tastes throughout the regions of specifically southeast Asia. I am British, but I would consider my favourite cuisine to be Chinese. The soups, the dumplings, the seafood, the vegetables all cooked so uniquely to bring an oriental flavour to my palate. The seafood here is the best I have ever experienced. The crab is brilliant, especially with the golden sauce (pumpkin based) or with a salt and pepper seasoning. The fish is fabulous, pan fried to perfection especially with the Hong Kong style Grouper, whose hints salty and savoury flavours allow the fish to melt in your mouth with delicate Local Flavours. Alongside the seafood, rice is never a bad option, especially with the Yung Chao fried rice or a more local seafood fried rice. Vegetables are sauteed with your choice of Garlic, XO sauce or other herbs and spices, which allows the steamed greens to sing their flavours. A large selection of meats with chicken, pork and beef cooked in different local sources are definitely worth a try. Pork Ribs melt off the bone with a local style BBQ sauce, whilst the chicken either braised or roasted are juicy, tender and lack the common dryness found today. Lastly, a great favourite of mine is the Peking Duck, which is served with a consistent level of tasty fat, crisp salty sweet skin, and tender meat. Combine that with the plum sauce, cucumber, spring onion and flour pancakes, it is worth every penny.Service is brilliant in this restaurant. The weekends are especially busy with the restaurant seeing almost full capacity for three hours, so service is slower on these day. I do have to admit that large groups on weekends will receive slower service, and the restaurant does go into panic mode and tends to serve those closer to the central kitchen much faster, but this neglect rarely happens. The servers are friendly, fun, and full of joy and life. They really make this family restaurant much more inviting and fun, and enjoyable.In all, it is a brilliant gem of Clementi, and has received great acclamation recently and in the past, and it continues to prove it's worth. The food quality is consistent, and always serve freshly made, delicious food. It is a family run, christian restaurant, which really adds to the positive and joyous aura of the place that it exudes so brilliantly. I would recommend anyone in the mood for brilliant local food to give Chin Huat a try. I may be a bit biased, but I am sure it will be more than worth it

The reason I come to this restaurant - salted egg yolk crab. No where else is it as good. They charge you extra for this dish because they use a lot of salted egg yolk and the mixture if just divine. It's not wet and saucy. It's a dry kind of sauce (I am aware that sounds like a moronic thing to say). A lot of other places have more sauce but there's usually because they add some starch or flour to the mix and it doesn't taste as good. My only compliant here is the crab is not always consistently good.. but that's because it's dependent on the supply of crab at that time. THey usually have 3 types of crab to offer, stick with the mangrove mud crab for this dish.. usually that's the sri Lankan crab. The razor clams are also good (so my friends say cause I don't eat that). Make a reservation especially if you're going on the weekends. Inside ac tables are available but call early
5
I visited Chin Huat for the first time to celebrate my birthday with family. I was surprised at the fine set up in a HDB block. One look and i thought high prices for sure but after my meal was quite happy with the price reasonable. Enjoyed the food and ambiance of the place
5
We've been going to this place for years. The food is always great! We are never disappointed with the food. Though service could be improved, but still acceptable as the waitresses speak English!
Definitely will come back to this place!
5
Steamed prawns (so very fresh!), suckling pig (forget about cholesterol), yam basket (melts in your mouth), ore-nee desert (so smooth it slides down your throat). And of course the black-beef hor-fun (rice-noodles) which is insanely value for money! This is one of my rave places. And wait for the suckling pig promotions!! you get about $30+ off the list price (for members). I held my Christmas luncheon here in the private room and it was a wonderful experience. Only one pet peeve - the staff are pushy about signing diners up as members
5
I went to the restaurants twice in a week, one for personal and another with colleagues who wanted to get some local seafood. Chin Huat was certainly a different experience for my overseas colleagues, which we ordered some great stuffs, Black Pepper Crabs and Chilli Crabs, Boston Lobster Bee Hoon, Sambal La-La and Crispy Chicken. This restaurant sits in the small enclave in Clementi, among the HDB public flats that many overseas guests may get to see >80% of population lives
5
This restaurant was highly recommended by my husband's nephew. It's a "must try" if you are visiting Singapore. When we were there, we were greeted by a very friendly staff Francis. We ordered 1. Cereal Prawns2. Crab with pumpkin sauce 3. Fried vegetables with chilli 4. Craypot hokkien noodles 5. And the unusual steamed shark fish head with green saucePrawns, crab and shark fish head were out of this world. I'm writing now, still remembering how I enjoyed them. The dessert was coconut pudding with ice-cream. This is the best thing to finish a meal. For me, this dinner is a 10
5
Chili crab was one of the culinary reasons I wanted to visit Singapore and it did not disappoint. Highlights:- Chili crab: such succulent large pieces of crab meat. Chili was tomatoey with a tiny bit of spice for a nice balance that didn't overpower the natural flavor of the fresh crab. 5 stars.- Black pepper crab: didn't know this version existed and being a pepper fan loved it so much. Best thing was having a piece of this and the chili crab and blending the sauces together upon dipping a piece on the plate. 5 stars.- Shrimp: simple fresh full ones. 4.5 stars- Take out: we took out our meal and it was still good.Lowlights:- Can't get this at home and will be craving it until I can have it again.Second to my best friend living in this country, I'd return to Singapore for this crab
5
Attended a group dinner at this acclaimed live seafood restaurant. There is ample parking at the nearby multi story carpark. We ordered Roast Suckling Pig, Alaskan King Crab in Black Pepper, Australian Rock Lobster with Bee Hoon, Live Garoupa and several other dishes. I was impressed with the quality of every dish that was served. Service was excellent though the restaurant was full. Possibly the best live seafood I've had in Singapore. Looking forward to my next visit there
5
This is a pleasant neighbourhood seafood place. Unpretentious and not somewhere u want to bring someone for an elegant meal. However for hardcore crab lovers like myself, this place is great! It's the best quality crab meat in SG. Crabs are always super fresh, sweet and moist. Whilst I'm a huge chilli crab fan, I'm really digging their pepper crab. The right amount of pepper but not overwhelming and doesn't take away from the natural sweetness of the flesh. We also had other dishes like sambal kangkong and etc.....which I can't remember but it's the crabs which were the main reason for our patronage. If u want great quality crabs in a pleasant no fuss envt then this is it.
4
A hidden gem. One of the best small seafood restaurants in Singapore.Very good seafood at reasonable prices. Everything is always fresh.A little out of the way. Very limited drink options, we're talking a couple of sodas, a couple of beers and a couple of wines, little over half a dozen items
4
We made reservation but there was a slight delay as they need to prepare our table. I thought we wouldn't have to wait with reservation. Food served are generally fresh. No complains ! We ordered 2 types of crab, chili and salted egg. Both are as good but for the salted egg, it's a bit plain on the inside as salted egg were only coated on the outside of the crab. For chili, you have the choice of having your crab with the gravy. Fish was very fresh. Had coconut ice cream and jelly for dessert. I think it was better than mango sago. Comes up to $1330 for 2 tables. We did not have their membership card but was given a 10% discount out of goodwill. Service was prompt given the fact that the restaurant was very crowded.Will return for dinner
5
We visited with a group of 7 and the service was amazing.Francis (who looks a bit of a younger Ronnie Corbet was so attentive and helpful with choices.So tasty food and great value for money.The owner Miss Amy really looks after you and makes you feel so special...Will be back.Paul
5
I've only had chili crab twice prior to this but I would have to say that the flavor from this restaurant really took the cake - or crab. However, flavor and spiciness went hand-in-hand. It was the spiciest chili crab I've had but ordering extra baos made it bearable. There wasn't much of a wait since we called in ahead for reservations the same day. Would definitely come back for another meal

I went as a group of girlfriends celebrating a birthday. All women were of similar age above 50. Most of us are Amateur Food Connaisseurs ( we liketo taste good food). We had 2 different types of crabs, one with salted eggs other was called ( with golden Sauce) This was a crab prepared with a delicious sweetish pumpkin Sauce. We had fish, egg-soupy-spinach dish (simple but good), Mantou. CRabs were excellent to taste. The food was very good. Worth the trip down to Clemnti. Service needs to be better when one to compete with other seafood Restaurants. The coconut and durian Desserts were unusual and very good to taste. Not too sweet, just the right amount of sugar. On the whole a good experience but the Price was a bit high for the Environment and Service. Very difficult ot talk as there was a lot of very loud Background noise
3
The seafood here was tasty, we had the crab and the lobster and both were quite meaty and fresh. They were served without all the necessary utensils but when we asked for them they were brought over promptly. The staff were slow to take our order and the food was slow to arrive despite the restaurant being mostly empty, so don't come here if you are in a rush!
4
Ordered the following dishes1) Chilli Crab2) Steam Soon Hock3) Braised Prawns4) Brocolli with Garlic5) Tofu6) Veg with 3 types of Egg7) Orh NeeThey were all very good. No complains with the food whatsoever. Reasonably well priced. The only thing lacking was the service staff in seating us down and taking our orders. It was dreadfully slow in that aspect and the staff weren't particularly friendly as they were very busy. Thankfully, the food arrived quite promptly upon ordering. Would have been a clear 5 stars if not for the service
1
This place has fallen from its olden glory days! The sign that shows that they are unable to guarantee meaty crabs already shows the poor quality crabs that they used! Can you imagine having mushy crabs that have no meat in them for 3 separate dining occasions with Chin Huat!!!! Please don't tell customers that you can't guarantee when the shells of the crabs were obviously not firm and hard! We had been given moulting crabs of poor quality instead of meaty crabs!!! And your service crew is horrendous... Needs to undergo retraining! A simple act of topping up hot water for tea took nearly forever when there was less then 10 tables for lunch!!! So, think twice before eating there!
4
We had 2 or 3 meals at this place on our visit to Singapore. We had specially ordered crab one night. The 'singapore crab' was amazing and lived up to our expectations. I shall go back again for this delicacy if I happen to visit Singapore again
2
My friend made a dinner reservation one month ago and requested for a table in the corner for more privacy. On arrival, we were given a corner table. After being seated for a while, one of the staff came over and asked if we could move to another table to make way for another group who had also made a reservation. Since we had arrived earlier than the other group and the staff could not give us a good reason why we had to move, we turned down the request. My friend had made an advance order for 3 crabs to be cooked in 2 different styles. When we asked if we could have a mix of male and female crabs, the staff taking our order, instead of answering our question, merely told us the price is the same for male and female crabs. We asked if we could have at least one female crab with roe. Again, instead of responding to our request or checking to see if there were female crabs available, she remarked that crab roe has high cholesterol content! We were absolutely stunned by her attitude! Throughout our dinner, we had a hard time catching the attention of the staff to replace our plates or refill our tea. Although the food was acceptable, the service was just horrendous. We will not be returning to this restaurant in the future. There are many other seafood restaurants serving the same kind of food with much better service

My father always bring us to chin huat when I was still a student. Sadly, my most recent visit did not bring back my fond memories.My family came for a dinner today, we ordered oysters, prawns, soon hock, 2 sri lanka crabs, lobster, veg, singapore style beehoon & hokkien noodle.The oysters are fine, afterall i ordered raw. My father had requested cooked with garlic. The soon hock was average, it felt kinda of overcooked as some parts of the flesh feel tough.The prawns did not taste sweet, usually they should. I'm not an expert, just my opinion.The lobster was not bad, a tad too salty for my mother's liking. We ordered 2 crabs; cooked with salty egg and black pepper. The salty egg taste well, except that the flesh is dry. Suspected was fried too long...the black pepper is overly spicy, didn't get to enjoy the crabs.It must distinct itself with average hawker food, if they charge at these prices

A visitor from Shanghai, who is used to great food, asked for Goby Fish. So off we went to Chin Huat for Soon Hock- steamed, we also had sliced beef with ginger and scallions, asparagus with scallops, soup of the day (shark bone) and lightly boiled very fresh prawns. What a great meal for 4 persons. Delicious, satisfying, all good!Great desserts- mango sago for 2, apply jelly for the others

The seafood is fresh, the selection is great! it is a little pricey though. It is also very hard to find parking space in this area. if you get a 10pax 1000+ set dinner, you will get to be seated in the private room. However, the private room has its down side, you will get less attention from the service personnel. Worse of all, the TV does not work time to time and the reception is very poor. What is the point of having a plasma TV in the room, when it only knows dots and lines

nice atmosphere. Good foods. I like their chilli crab and hor fun. Sit outside is best. Good prices. No corkage charges. I will be back👍

Chilli crab was great although not cheap. Service was fast and very satisfactory. Will visit it again next time I'm in Singapore.

We were part of a large party here. The service was great and the food was wonderful. We were served about 12 courses and each one was great.

My family loves a good "Zhi Char" place and we visited Chin Huat on a Tuesday evening. The restaurant was located in a peaceful location so it wasn't noisy like a market place. We enjoyed our dinner outdoors under the shade and it was a wonderful evening.The two crabs we ordered (Special Sauce style) were amazingly good! Finger licking good! The crabs were meaty and very fresh - the best I have tasted! We will go back again to try the crabs in other styles (Black Pepper / Chilli Crab etc).The food wasn't too salty and every thing we ordered was tasty and of good quality. We especially like the fish fillet cooked in soya sauce Cantonese style. We also like that fact that the restaurant has fresh live seafood still kept in the tanks on site - we feel assured that the food is fresh and not frozen. Those who enjoy having dinner in air-con places will be happy to know that the restaurant has an indoor air-conditioned section too. We had a very good experience with the staff as well. They were attentive, friendly and professional. Our one-year old was with us and he was given a baby chair and baby utensils too!We are fans

This is a suburban family favorite in the Sunset area, off Clementi.We love their fresh crabs, pre-ordered suckling pig and many other favorites.Sometimes the fresh seafood can be rather pricey so always ask what it costs!Garlic razor clams are another favorite when the price is right. We prefer crabs over lobsters, more meat than shell so I can't comment on live lobsters!Cereal prawns, crispy chicken. Oh yes, generally good service too

The food was good unfortunately not enough to make up fir the high prices and terrible service. They're completely understaffed. It's almost impossible to get the wait staff's attention for water or napkins etc . I had to walk over to the cashier to get my bill . 2 of the 3 items we specifically wanted to eat was unavailable. We did however enjoy the steamed prawns and fish.

Tucked away behind a housing complex, this restaurant is a gem that needs to be discovered. It's unlikely any but the most intrepid gourmets would expend the effort, but it's well worth it. The black pepper Sri Lankan crab we had was fresh and fleshy, with just the right amount of condiments to be tasty but not tongue-burningly spicy. The fried rice was juicy but not oily, and the stir-fried vegetables with garlic were divine

Just finish a family reunion dinner and the group really enjoyed the food. Sri Lankan crabs done in pepper and another in chilli crab, my favourite spinach with 4types of eggs, cereal prawn, Steam Soon Hock, roast chicken, as well as the claypot noodles were devoured. Have heard the suckling pig is very good. I also enjoyed the desserts like durian pudding with ice cream. What can be frustrating for guest is finding the restaurant which is located in a U shape HDB block 105, surrounding the block 107 food court. Its on the other end of the block after the carpark just after Balmoral Bakery. Best if driving is to park in the multi storey car (enter via 1st Carpark park on Sunset Way or along Clementi) and walk pass the long line of restaurants facing the canal

What restaurant would keep the woks hot and food coming on even when we are very late? Though our concert had finished later than we expected, we still managed to get the most amazing meal which we had specially pre-ordered with Chin Huat. Service here is the best, the seafood is out of this world, and the wok-hei is just wonderful. Bee Hoon fried the old style.....simply amazing! Try the lobster bee hoon...nothing beats that

The food here is always good. I have been eating at Chin Huat for many years, and even when I go alone, I am a happy person. I like eating the Beef Hor Fun (Beef with stir fried flat white noodles). It has great wok hei, which gives the noodles a slightly burnt taste that is delicious. I have come with groups and eaten the lobsters, crabs and other dishes and they are all of good quality. Service can be a bit slow if they are crowded. Ambience is not much to shout about - it's just a half airconditioned coffee shop. No regrets though
