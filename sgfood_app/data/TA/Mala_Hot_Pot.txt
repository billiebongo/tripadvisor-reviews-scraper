Great dish. Choose your meat, vegie, whatever you fancy. With preferred level of spicyness. But one thing they really need to watch for: please ease up on the salt.

This place was recommended by one friend of mine who stayed in Singapore! Mala Hot Pot can be either in dry or soup base. We tried soup base for this round and it's superb! Beware, it's spicy yet you will get addicted!

We were crazy about mala hot pot recently. We explore and tried a few of the recommended ones, however we still find this one the best so far..don't try the wrong one as there are a few stall offering the same thing.. The stall unit number is #01-103

It's located at people park which is same like Chinatown, the place is like a canteen without AC so it's a little uncomfortable but the food it's all worth the taste and the price. This Mala Hot Pot is so famous and I need to queue about 10 minutes before order, and it's most crowded food stand ever. Especially when it's dinner time. The seller is using mandarin and they are not quite good with english. Advice, choose wisely because the portion is so big. Get ready for some shock taste with spice

This is a superb eatery for you to go! The food here is cheap as compared to the nearby vicinity restaurants that sells similar food. The serving potion is ample for 2 people. I love this place highly recommend. *ps if you can't take spicy choose the low level spicy level* the spicy level will built up
