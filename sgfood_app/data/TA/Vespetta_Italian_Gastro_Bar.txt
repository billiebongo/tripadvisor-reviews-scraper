Romantic place for dinner, nice food and service. Someone was smoking at the nearby bar and a bit annoying.

Nice Italian food in a place full of tourist traps. Quite pleasantly surprised to find the good better than average. We had the calamari which was fresh. Mains were the ravioli (nice n tasty cream base) and the pizza which was of a decent size.

A hidden gem. Serves very good food. Offers very affordable set lunch, 2 courses at $20 & 3 courses at $25. Good place for business lunch. Happy hours from 12-7pm.

Along the river in Singapore we found this very authentic southern Italian restaurant serving top food as they would do in Puglia in Italy. We visited the restaurant various times and tried a number of their dishes, all great with good Italian ingredients. The wine list is good and reasonably priced. come before 7 pm. to take advantage of their happy our offers

Great time out and, considering we are in Singapore, very close to authentic food. I know ingredients are local and not as tasty as ones you can get at home in Puglia. Very affordable as well, considering you are sitting in the center of Boat quay. Beer and wine prices are lower than nearby places and you are drinking original Italian Peroni beer too! Staff was great and helpful too. Definitely worth a visit

Brief walk from hotel for dinner. Welcomed to a view of the quay. Drinks ordered and quickly arrived. Shared a starter of burrito and Parma ham which was ample for two. Delicious and good quality. Both chose a lasagne - looked small but deceiving. Again very nice and piping hot! Would recommend- nice views, good service and good food.

Fairly new place that is nestled in between busy other places that are larger, staff does their best to serve you well, the chef often comes out and talks to customers. Bruschetta is well done and Ravioli are good too. Would only recommend for small bites and a nice glass of wine or other beverage. Felt that it is quite civilized even though it looks super casual but for sure a place where you can enjoy quietly. People make the place and unfortunately staff changes too often, however the chef is a constant which is good

Food was all wonderful. I had some cold cut and buffalo mozzarella cheese, steak, pasta and pizza. Every bite was wonderful. Even cannot say which only one was nice or specialty. So authentic and lovely. Definately will come back to try different wine. Made me having amazing dinner

I enjoy this place - simple but very good authentic Italian food. Excellent service - the staff are friendly, attentive and make you feel at home. Good ambience.

Really authentic and delicious Italian food, coupled with lovely service from the staff- who are also Italians.
We enjoyed our dinner immensely. Probably one of the best choices along the crowded Quay!

Authentic Italian food is not complicated. But with quality ingredients and good preparation it is always tasty. Many Italian restaurants put their own spin on classic Italian dishes and end up losing the essential qualities of the original. Not so with Vespetta. The food here is just like you would get in a family run restaurant in Italy. Simple. Authentic. Delicious.And, as a bonus, you get the wonderful views views over the Singapore River

First of all, I am not saying it because I am Italian.This is the place where you can drink the best Spritz in Singapore. The location of the place helps to make it a wonderful place where to have an "Aperitivo" or drinks after dinner. I can't say anything about the dinner because I never dining here but I am sure the food will be more than fine

Was here for a early dinner with friends and enjoyed a really good evening, by the river.. good vibes of teh boat quay nightlife, and nice setting indoor and outdoor.The Aperol spritz was really good and they have good deal on happy hours for beers.I had burrata and pizza, and while it was cheaper than the usual city prices, the quality was very good!nice tiramisu too

We went there for dinner. The place is small and tables are small too. The ambience is definitely casual and simple. But the food was very good and so was the price. Some restaurants in Boat Quay area usually charge more due to its heavy tourist area. We ordered Rib eye steak, spring chicken with rosemary, spaghetti, quatroFormaggi pizza, smoke salmon insalatta and a side order of fries. It costs only $220 inclusive of gst and service tax and a bottle of wine, juices and mimosa. Absolutely a great value.Host (owner?) is an Italian, and very cordial and nice. The food was very good too. We'll be back for sure
5
I was our second visit at vespetta. It's really obvious that is authentic restaurant as the owners been always there. The Aperol spritz taste exactly the same as in Italy (not watery as in other places in Singapore). Deffinettely the place where we will go again l

Happened upon this place while searching for a bite for my birthday dinner. Chef treated me with a plate of homemade gnocchi and a dessert that was just sublime. Couldnt have asked for a better night out for dinner with the wife. The Mojitos were top notch as well. Hopefully, i will have time for a return visit

Normally you won't expect "good" food on this strip but this new Italian gem was a real find! Attentive stuff( nice view
and simple but yet very tasty Italian food, had some Appetizers and will come back to try the pizza!
4
Really impressed - not many reasonably priced quality Italian restaurants around. Glasses of wine $9.50 at happy hour and $11 non. Meat dishes around $26. Really happy with the food
5
Visited twice .
They have a good set lunch at attractive prices!
Food tastes very good! Friendly and quick service!
Definitely one of our new places to more frequently come for lunch.

Had the Calamari(well cooked nice and Soft) the deep fried Mozzarella (which were genuine mini Mozzarella Balls) and the Cheese Croquettes (you could taste the cheese). Simple tasty, I would think we will back to continue exploring the menu.

Vespetta is conveniently located in Clarke Quay in Singapore. If you get riverside tables, do take them coz it's much nicer to sit by the water and eat :). The margarita pizza is fab, but the truffle pasta is to DIE for! Service is prompt and friendly, and the place has a lovely happening vibe to it. One more thing is that it's vegetarian friendly, which is tough to find in Clarke Quay. Do go for a meal here and you will enjoy!

Went to this restaurant for dinner on 18 May, Friday. On the menu was pizza with ham and mushrooms. We request for the waiter to replace ham with salami instead. The waiter agreed immediately without even needing to check with the chef. Pizza was tasty. We also had calmari. It is crispy on the outside and the squid is nice and soft in the inside. Excellent food! The waiter came over to check with us regularly whether we need anything else and feedback for the food items.

This restaurant is an example of authentic Italian gourmet food. I come here often and every time I try something different: all the menu is good and as good as in Italy.The staff is very kind and efficient. Also the location is perfect, particularly at night.Strongly recommended

There is so much to choose from at Boat Quay but this place is worth a try if you are overindulged in Asian cuisine. You have the benefit of that lovely waterside position and so if you try hard enough you could even imagine you are transported to Venice! Service is not rushed and the quality was good at a reasonable pric

After enjoying Asian food for over a week, it was time for pizza. In the evenings, the Boat Quay is a great location by the water for dinner. We met the owner and Chef of this new restaurant, Francesco, who prepared the great authentic south Italian pizzas for us. We warmly recommend this Gastro Bar
