I had breakfast with my daughter in here before boarding on the airplane. The food here is quite nice and quite reasonably price for the airport food price.

The tea, coffee, milo were all above par. The crispy toast was awesome, we had 3 varieties.... butter sugar, peanut butter, strawberry jam toast.. all were good!

As we were walking around looking for a snack, a lady suggested we try this. $7.20 for coffee, laksa and toast. Very tasty and quick service.

Waking up very early in the morning after a midnight off-hour flight to SG from MNL could be very punishing. Sleeping in the airport gives travelers a backbreaking experience especially if you don't want to take a chance sitting on the cold floor re-charging your gadget, wondering why you're there or taking a long nap stretching all your muscles until they gave you a cracking, but satisfying sound.Toast Box provides the early-morning respite to give traveler a satisfying breakfast. The smell of newly-cooked offerings and the airport atmosphere provide a rare experience

You will surely like simple food (toasted bread, local laksa and noodles at reasonable price at the airport before you board your plane. Personally, I enjoy the aromatic thick coffee taken with toasted Kay's and butter bread and some perfectly prepared half-boiled eggs for a hearty breakfast. You will surely be impressed by the speed at which these items are served at a jiffy

We love the coffee and kaya toast at the Toast Box . Very reasonable and Super yummy meal. Kaya though loaded with sugar and butter is a typical singaporean cuisine . Good for meal on the go and those in hurry .ice lemon tea is also worth trying and even the cakes

This restaurant / cafe experience is supposed to replicate the authentic roadside bodega culture of Singapore's food stalls and mom and pop coffee places. That's how I understand it. I ate the Toast with Shrimp Floss / Pork Floss and condensed milk and was completely bewildered by how this became a dish. I don't think it tasted bad, but it was pretty weird. Anyway, I do recommend it. It's a great way to orient yourself to Singapore. Also ordered the Singapore Coffee for a pre-flight pick me up. Intensely strong. Flavored with four scoops of sugar, I think, but doesn't taste good. It tastes like flash-frozen dried coffee flakes and is really really intense. It's like cuban coffee, but without the amazing kick and flavor. Let's put it this way, not a bad little cafe, easy service, fast and cheerful, but bland, like Singapore's risk intolerant conservatism. Save your coffee money for Dunkin Donuts

Toastbox has to be one of my favourite places for breakfast when in Singapore. There are several scattered throughout the country. My favourite is the kaya toast breakfast set which includes two very soft boiled eggs, coffee and kaya toast. Because it's great value for money you are almost sure to queue but this won't be for long and it's well worth the wait
