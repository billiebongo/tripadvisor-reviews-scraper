Spacious private dining room. Fresh food, delicious broth, appetizers and desserts, attentive and friendly staff.
3
Tom Yam soup base was too sweet. I remember that it tasted better years ago when I last visited . Also pricey for the quality of food.
5
Attentive staff. Fresh ingredients. Worth the visit! Family gathering and we enjoyed ourselves. Thank you.

Food quality was decent, quantity too. But hygiene seemed to be lacking. Waitress dipped the serving plate into the steamboat soup as she placed the meat into the soup.

Went to have our reunion dinner on 15/2/2018. N we noticed the Branch Manager was very efficient n good. He can handled the customers well. He acted fast too. When there was a little boy kept crying, he got his staff to bring out toys to pacify the boy. Thou his plan was not successful but he is very observant for his entire restaurant n acted fast to each issue.

Had dinner here after a day at Universal Studios. We took the plunge of trying the chilli crab. It was very good and an excuse to make a mess. One crab was sufficient for two people and we had a starter each as well. Considering what we had it wasnâ€™t that expensive either
4
Visited the place with 3 other friends just a few days ago on a saturday afternoon. The place was packed, business was good. The food, especially the fish glue, is a must try and oysters were very fresh. Could see that the staff were all working very hard, and they were so busy that they did not have time to clear tables after guests left. Special praise for them, good job! (Many of them were teenagers, must be part-timers) However, i must say that the manager was very lazy, did not help his staff with anything. Noticed that whenever a table called to ask for something and he saw it, he would never go serve the table himself despite seeing that his staff were busy but would ask his staff to do it. Just strolls around when the reception was empty and telling his staff to do this and that. He saw many uncleared tables but would not even help. Loading his staff with more work on top of so much work. No wonder his staff were all constantly so busy from the time i stepped in till i left! Did not get to see this manager's name but he is balding and looks like he is at least in his 50's. The previous time when i went there, manager Shawn was serving my family and I. He was hardworking and works like a regular staff, clearing tables and serving guests. I am pretty sure that the balding manager isn't as well-liked among his staff than manager Shawn is.

Since its inception, Coca has been a very popular steamboat restaurant in Thai Style for many years in Singapore. Much to my surprise when I visited during one of the weekday, it was full and the walk-in diners had to wait 30 minutes or more for the table. My overall impression was that it provided value-for-money buffet dinner with quite a big selection of food. I personally liked the menu except beef items.
4
Enjoyed the selection of-chicken and Tom yam for cooking the raw food. Sauce with tamarind as a sides made available for dipping cooked food was delicious. Manager of the restaurant was very friendly and chatty making us feel welcomed. Overall good selection of raw food. Also had 1 for 1 drinks.
5
Excellent service 1. Manager made me feel like home 2. My kids made such a mess but the service staff made them feel like they okay 3. They served us all the food and helped us to cook. 4. They knew what food I liked and brought more of it out for the buffetFeeling so hassled when I came but after that i felt like the entire staycation at sentosa was worth it
3
I thought the food was average. It was our 2nd steamboat experience and elsewhere was better. We were unsure as well. Maybe a mix of a really big day, that was hot and than our choice for hot steamboat.. Maybe bad choice on our behalf.
5
The service staff are very alert and they give good recommendations on the fresh seafood buffet. We started from 8 pm and enjoyed the dinner till 10 pm without unnecessary disruptions

Delicious and satisfying steamboat in Resorts World Sentosa
COCA at Resorts World Sentosa
4
Very fresh raw food for the steamboat. Fat and juicy oysters! Good service.
And, they never tell you any food from the menu is sold out or no more! Unlike Peach Garden!
4
The ingredients were fresh and the food arrived promptly. The service was good too! The food overall was good, especially the special dipping sauce. Would recommend trying!
5
First visit and was quite impressed with the simplicity and authencity of the food. Must try handmade pork balls
4
Have been to Coca rather regularly but this visit, standard have dropped due to the taste and texture of the food served. The chicken soup based is more peppery and the famous chili sauce is much thicker and taste a little different. Price is still high for weekdays dinner.
3
It's been years since I've dined at Coca and was really looking forward to it. We reserved a table for 7.30pm post our show at RWS Theatre. It was a good thing we did as subsequent walk-ins were turned away by Manager who said they were fully reserved for the rest of the evening. The deco of the place was somewhat clinical with white tables and black chairs and no welcoming warmth one would expect from a dining venue. Anyway we placed our order beef slices, squid, signature pork balls, fish paste and a vegetables basket. The total price including 3bowls of rice and no drinks was $80/- for 2adults and 1child. Soup was half tomyam and half chicken broth. Nothing too impressive as chick broth tastes soup cube like. I personally preferred the tomyam which was spicy and sweet enough for me. Service was quick but nothing impressive, was not offered any plain water when we didn't order any drinks but saw other tables being served with glasses of water. There is buffet alacarte option available at $43++ for adults $25++ for kids. We didn't opt for this as kid doesn't not eat much. Overalll I'd rate the suki sauce still the best and the ingredients fresh enough. However I think they need to catch up with other hotpot restaurants who now offer better broths and dips and service at the same pricing.
5
Serves good amount of food and tomyum soup is very tasty.Enjoyed their good and prompt service at Coca in Resort World Sentosa. Thumbs up for their service.I had to be more specific especially in naming the branch as I had experienced not that good service in other branch
3
One of the quintessential hotpot restaurants in Singapore, Coca has a respectable spread in their buffets with decent quality. Their Thai chili sauce is perhaps what sets them apart from their competition, at least in my personal opinion. Overall, a simple hotpot restaurant that doesn't really go wrong
4
The environment is quiet which is good for family and friends gathering. The service over there is good. The food over is fresh and nice to eat but not much variety to choose from. The pricing is quite reasonable.
5
Quality and Fresh food for steam boat buffet.
Awesome chilli sauce and tom yam broth. Place is clean.
Would be nice if drinks are bottomless for both Premium and regular buffet.
Service is great.
5
We had the sumptuous seafood steamboat buffet. The ingredients were quite fresh and the entire family enjoyed the cook-and-eat experience!
5
Foods are nice. Price is affordable. Soups are nice too. Service is good too. Place is easy accessible too
4
Went for the buffet lunch and dinner twice respectively. Dinner spread definitely is much better than lunch.
5
We couldn't stop eating! Coca knows how to do steamboat. The waiters start the cooking for you. Steamboats can typically get quite messy but the cooking process here is well thought out and efficient, and the food is awesome. Must try the fish glue, but typical steamboat dishes like yam, wanton and meat were all right on the mone
2
We were one of the first few groups of customers for lunch on a Saturday. Before starting, they told us that the premium items sold out hence we couldn't order the premium buffets. Taking up their recommendation for the normal buffet, we were appalled when some of the items started running out by our second order. After an unsatisfying lunch, we wanted to order desserts from the menu (not part of buffet) but were informed that the only dessert left was ice kachang. How to open for business when so many things run out? I feel sorry for those customers who came in after us. The manager apologised and gave us 2 traveler organisers as a token but the lunch experience was already spoilt
3
We were there before our reservation time as our activities ended early and we are starving. We enter the restaurant and at this time the restaurant was only half full. The staff checked our reservation and said that the table is not ready and request us to come back at 7pm (which is our reservation time). The empty tables were placed with "reserved" tag so I thought might be reserved by other guests who has an earlier timing than us we reached at 6.30pm), so well we went out of the restaurant and wander around a little but as we are really starving so nothing caught our eyes. We went back to wait outside of the restaurant at 6.45pm, when 1 of the staff saw us outside, he finally gave us a table, from the time we were seated till we left (about 2 hrs or more), the restaurant did not get crowded and full, why wasn't we given a table in the 1st place then? And when we are having our meal, a couple came into the restaurant (without reservation) were given a table immediately.
5
My family of 4 adults & 1 child enjoyed the buffet lunch at COCA. The chilli dip was as usual marvelous, ingredients were fresh and service was attentive & prompt. The only area of improvement would be if the pork & beef could be in slices (easier to cook) instead of fillet (likely to become overcooked & tough)
2
The steamboat is a old-fashion style, although it comes with yuan-yang pot. The base soups were not an option - chicken and tom yam (or something, lack of spiciness). The food options were the usual, like fish glue, different kind of balls, greens, meat, prawn... The meat did not even come in shabu-thin slices. The condiment sauce was already pre-mixed. I believe this is a good option if oldies are invited, but compared to a lot of steamboat available nowadays, it does not give me a "wow" factor
4
Great experience at this outlet! Staff were helpful and friendly. Will definitely recommend this to my friends and family.
5
We like the Thai source to go with the steamboat . Took a lot of fish balls and vegetables . Fresh and taste good
2
Food is fresh and the soup is delicious. Hardly to call for service. Like no one heard about it. Recommended to try at NGEE ANN city
5
Very nice experience, was there 3 hours before the reserved slot, the staff were flexible, nice and courteous. Will be there again.
2
This place serves Thai style steam boat. Prices are very affordable. Quality is poor. Service is ok. Can skip is you want.
5
What I love is the cockles and flower crab ! KeepOrdering those the whole night since it was buffet! It is located at the last end of shops! Haha very near to hard rock hotel! Would recommend to come here for good buffet steamboat dinner! The guy manager services was extremely good, he gave my sis a small token from coca when we told her it's my Sia birthday! Thanks for making our night enjoyable 
4
This is a steam boat restaurant where you cook raw cuts of meat, seafood etc in a boiling pot of soup stock. Needless to say Coca's food is fresh and of good quality. However, through the years of patronising them, we now feel they are overpriced especially for dinner.
3
Passed this restaurant many times and finally decided to try it. We ordered variety of dishes - fried rice, different shrimps, juices, duck noodles etc. All good was ok, but nothing fancy at all. Definitely not the best place to try Asian cousins. There are many much better places to eat around.
2
The overall experience was kinda oaky but for a restaurant situated in a place like Santos's, it's not good enough service for what they charge. The waiters didn't seem to understand English. There was no help when asked for suggestions. In fact, they either didn't speak English or feigned ignorance. Definitely a no no for a reputable place
1
I would say I love any style of steamboat, but this restaurant really disappoint me. The clear soup base just taste like instant noodle soup and the tomyam soup, not thai at all. The pork ball not fresh, the noodle so so... everything is so disappointed. We ordered chinese tea and ended they refill us with plain water. Omg. Horrible experience. The only credit they have is roast pork taste good, the crunchiness just nice. Anyway, I will still choose not to return to any Coca in Singapore.
4
Went for their premium buffet at rws branch. Staff were really attentive and polite. Mini lobsters and lobsters were fresh. On the contrast, Oysters are not fresh.
3
Not a very great experience. The service here was far from the one at Kallang outlet. Empty plates was left on the table for a very long time and the crews were not attentive. Hope it gets better
4
Great service by Coca's crew! Good range of offering for steamboat. Will definitely be back again sometime!
4
Fried chicken wings is out of stock when I visit early afternoon lunch, strange. Should they prepare a bit more for lunch crowd.
5
Went for a buffet lunch for 2 paxs. All dishes were fresh and portion were generous too. Staff were attentive to details and topped up soup and tea without the need of being asked.
4
We had the dinner buffet which offers rather good variety. Food is fresh. Unfortunately the tom yum soup is too sour. The staff is also friendly and attentive.
5
had the best tom yum soup with lovely sea-food -fresh tasty yummy!
Ohhhh what lemon grass flavour..hmmmm
also had chinese tea and noodle...just goooo
4
Went there on 22 Nov for a family bday celebration. Staff are v friendly and helpful. However, food choice for lunch buffet option not alot.. it would be better if there are more choices.
4
Good selection of steamboat picks and great staff's service and recommendation who make the place a wonderful place for a casual family dinner.
4
Visited this restaurant on a rainy Christmas Eve for dinner and they two options for the buffet; the one with lobsters and scallops or the usual one and we chose the one with lobsters! After all, it's Christmas Eve. The seafood tasted fresh though I'm sure they were frozen. Thus, would not give them a five stars. But no doubt, the seafood were reasonable good and the service pretty prompt except for the couple of times I asked them to refill my barley.Basically, free flow of seafood and drink. The broth for the tom yam was said to be one of the best. Another mention would be the thinly sliced beef. Good in my opinion but it would be better if there were more fats on them
4
Love the Chilli sauce used as a special dip for the various steamboat dishes. The food is fresh and the tomyum soup was delicious! The waiting staff are polite and attentive!
4
It must have been more than a year since my last visit.
Was there to celebrate my wedding anniversary and the food are still as good as it gets.
Services were prompt and would recommend for a good feast at Coca.
4
Had a wonderful dinner with my family, but there was a few very small black flies (not mosquito, not fly) distrubing us throughout.
4
food is awesome fish paste pork skin crab n beef good. service good they help u put in. bad thing is drinks expensive n are a separate cost
5
Their lunch buffet is really worth the value because there are a sizeable variety of meat and vegetable dishes. Must try are fish glue, beef fillet, special dumpling, fish fillet. The chilli is not hot and is the main attraction.
3
Pros;
1. Food was good.
2. Price is reasonable for Sentosa island.
3. House wine is affordable
Cons;
1. Service is slow.
2. Staffs are mostly trainee and have difficulties to understand English
4
Affordable steamboat buffet for the whole family. Quite a lot of variety. Food was delicious and service was fast.
5
Had a family lunch just last Sunday. The food was fresh and tasty. Serving of food is fast and servers accommodated to request accordingly. We have a 4 year old child with us but the servers were understanding and friendly despite the mess created. Thumbs up for the service
4
We were early there at 5 pm and we had a great early dinner. The choice for selection was very good and we chose al la cart rather than the buffet spread as we wanted a mix of cooked food and steam boat. The sliced pork collar and baked scallops was perfectly done. The chicken soup stock was tasty. Service was very good, the restaurant was very clean we had a great dinner. We have been to several Coca branches in Bangkok and Singapore but this branch at Sentosa is our favorit
1
My booking was made at 7.30pm, I reached at 7.15pm & a lady told me that she had given my table to customers waiting in line. Prior to this they miss called me one time at 6pm+ & I called back telling a guy that I still want my table and I'll be reaching at 7.15pm. The guy acknowledge and agreed.Upon reaching, the lady told me that she had called me many times which is totally untrue. She only called me once. Releasing my table before 7.30pm without a confirmation is unacceptable as well. I don't see the point of reserving a table on Chope if that's the case.They have an internal communication problem and I hope they will fix it because I'm never visiting COCA in RWS anymore as the other outlets are so much better in terms of service
4
Excellent variety of dishes to choose from when taking buffet. Must try are fish glue, beef fillet, special dumpling, green noodles.
5
Environment is conducive for family and friends private gathering as site are always from main tourists areas, staffs are friendly.
2
Staffs were rushing customers to finish their food even though the restaurant will be closed in an hour time. Staffs also not attentive to customers as they were seen chatting among themselves.
5
First time going rws coca. The staff is more attentive and friendly as compare to takashimaya outlet. Will go again.
4
Had ala carte buffet for 2 persons for dinner. Portion is adequate and delivered to our table very promptly. Food is quite fresh especially the seafood. Some of the nice food items that we enjoy include thin beef slice, beef fillet, prawns and flower crabs. There are only 2 types of soups. Overall I feel that the price is a bit steep for a buffet dinner. Customer service has lots of room for improvement. Staff are not very attentive and friendly. They love to talk and joke among themselves. This restaurant is worth going to only if you are a hungry or a night ester.
4
Chope-ing was super easy. Acknowledgement was instantaneous. Service staff were professional. However, one particular table with Chinese guests was extremely rowdy and noisy. Staff should have politely controlled the situation to maintain the poshness of the restaurant. The guests were foreigners so it is very likely they were not aware of the culture here
5
My old parents is having their long holiday in Singapore Sentosa island for 10 days. After trying several cuisine in the island (French cuisine at Joel Robuchon, Japanese cuisine at Syun, Chinese cuisine at Fengshui Inn, Forest & Avenue Joffre, and seafood dinner at Ocean restaurant), I decide to brought my old parents to this Thai restaurant. They are having buffer for lunch at $27 per person (which I think it is a very reasonable price). We were greeted and served by the staff Betty Cheah (hope I spell correctly). She is so attentive to details and make my old parents very happy. My heartfelt thanks to her!The fish glue and prawn ball is our favorite. The restaurant offers special discount for senior citizens too. We'll definitely come back.
5
Well greeted by Restaurant Manager, Jason Tarm and staff, Shawn, Darren and 2 junior lady staff or trainees.They were attentive, helpful and prompt which made our lunch sessions an enjoyable one.Specially mentioned and applauded Jason Tarm who also checked our taste buds and offered complimentary desserts. A pleasant surprise which a little thought, meant so much for us diners and friends; 3 Adults and 1 child on my birthday. He's certainly an asset to the Organisation. As for the foods, they were good and consist of many varieties with a choice of spicy and non spicy soups. Though it's a steamboat, it's unique and different from other steamboat. Specially mentioned is the sweet and a bit spicy chilli and fish glue which tasted excellent. A Happy Birthday Lunch indeed. Already booked for next dinner session on May; this time with a family of 7 pax
3
Hesitated after seeing some bad reviews and tried to eat dinner on Saturday at 1815h when was told had to clear out 2000h though was a buffet. Still on Sunday went in for late lunch at 1330h. Not very crowded and had time to slowly eat the buffet but disappointed that c I couldn't make our own sauce and no choice of soup base.
2
Neither the food nor the service was up to the mark considering the prices they charge. The portions were too small and taste average. One can get better duck and noodles in Chinatown at one third the prices. The service was slow and the servers glum faced. A very disappointing experience overall
4
The food was pretty good but the place itself wasn't to great. I thought that their chairs weren't very comfortable and the staff weren't very good at getting our orders right.
4
Great steamboat place with fresh ingredients. Prices are a little steep, but if you are a big eater, it will be well worth cause it is ala carte buffet!
5
Superb and prompt services, the selection of food is fresh, as this is not my first time dinning in the restaurant with my family. keep up the good work. Looking forward to go there again.
4
The food was good and fresh. My family and I had a wonderful meal especially with the attentive service provided by Honey and Betty whom kept their smile while topping up our food, sauce and drinks. We will be back.
2
We were there at 6.15pm and we're told that we have to finish our dinner by 8pm. So we quickly.request for our 1st round of food from the buffet dinner menu. Subsequently when we need to refill the chilli or request for 2nd serving of food, the waiters and waitress were so busy.or hardly be seen at the restaurant to attend to our request. End up we walked up to the cashier who always stayed at the counter to request for refill of chilli and soup as well as passing her the request list for refill of food.Will not go again Price does not match with service.Service were so much better last tim
3
The portion of the food seems to be lesser comparing to the past. Some of the customer service personnel provide great attitude but I have faced one customer service lady whom her attitude was shocked. I have asked her a question and I was told to go to the counter and ask myself, then she just turned away from me. I was shocked with her expression, body language and attitude
2
The customer service in this particular branch is quite terrible. Every request we made is answered with a sour and unwilling face to the point we were afraid to ask for any kind of service anymore. Not just one but most of the servers are like this. Maybe they need a pay rise.
2
Spent the day at Universal Studios and decided to try this restaurant for dinner. Service was poor from the start. We were asked if we were having cooked food or steamboat. As a foreigner and visitor, I replied that I did not know the difference. I asked for further detail on steamboat which was reluctantly given. We were given out food and drinks and never saw the waitress again. It was not worth the effort to get her attention for another drink. Food was pretty average, without much spice or taste. Would not recommend this restaurant.
3
Had the buffet lunch at Cocoa RWS on Sunday for a family of three. Enjoyed the food as they were fresh. Had a sumptuous lunch. However, given the location at RWS, would expect better service to be provided since it is a tourist 'hot-spot'. Perhaps will try to dine at the other branches, definitely not back to this outlet again
3
First I should say we ate at 2:30pm so it wasn't the busy time, so many of our first choice options weren't available. Even so, the food we did receive was okay, but nothing to rave about. The cockle salad was zesty but I would be careful ordering it by itself, the pork was a little fatty and the service was just ok. The toilets are around the corner. But it may be better in the evening
5
Excellent service, and ally type of good cozen, amazing staff and service , clean and greeat sitting area ,,don’t miss this place
4
The staff went out of their way to make sure my lunch was gluten free. They brought plenty of meat and fish to the table, together with a selection of vegetables. We had an enjoyable lunch, served promptly, and found the staff very helpful.
5
Last min decision to eat here. Called in the afternoon and was able to get sitting for 6pm to 8pm slot for dinner. Mother's day, so was expecting the restaurant to be over crowded and super expensive. However was surprise to learn that the restaurant is having a promotion for Mother's Day which I dun think any of the restaurants will offer. Mother dines for free with every 3 paying adult. Services(5 Stars)1. Called up in the afternoon to check about the 2 time slot 6pm to 8pm and 8.15pm to 10.30pm. Wanted a longer eating time so ask the staff that answer my call about the better timing as I think 8.15pm to 10.30pm is a longer timing. However the staff give my the second surprise. He told me I can start dining as early as 4plus. However I still start at 6pm.2) A busy day as it was mother's day. So was not expecting much about the service during Dinning. However, the staff was very good, changing our dirty plates often, refilling our Ice water(50cents per person) whenever it's running low. Refilling our chilli whenever it runs low. And always serving with a smile. Food(4 stars)1) The choice of food was a bit limited.2) However the food was fresh...3) No desert.I think the service I got was very good. I seldom come across a restaurant that give good service during a busy day(Mother's Day). I will be back soon.
4
Delicious food and reasonably priced. You can have buffet or a la carte - we chose al la carte. Staff not overly friendly but ok. Drinks took a long time and ended up getting up ourselves to refill water glasses each time. Would return again if we are in the area

I visited Coca Steamboat Restaurant years back - the one at Takashimaya Shopping Centre, and I still remember it as being one of the best steamboat places I have been to, till now.A fusion of Thai and traditional Chinese steamboat, Coca serves quality and fresh ingredients for its steamboat. One may also choose to order a la carte items or have the buffet option at SGD$42.00 per pax. We chose the latter, andselected both the Tomyum and Clear Chicken Soup.Anyway, we placed our orders and food was served shortly - an assortment of fresh oysters, pig liver, clams, chicken, beef, vegetables, enoki mushrooms, fish paste and vegetables. The ingredients were well-portioned and tasty - be it marinated meats or infused with the tasty flavors of the soup. The meats were tender and overall, the ingredients were fresh.We enjoyed our steamboat dinner at Coca Steamboat Restaurant once again - a healthy, sumptuous and very filling, balanced meal.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit: http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/12/dinner-at-coca-steamboat-restaurant-rws.htm

We were last customer to enter and had only about 20 mins till the last order but yet, the staff still welcomed us with heart warming smiles to our seats and served our soup bases and the menu for the ingredients. We had a wide array of choices and prices were reasonable for restaurant grade steamboat. We ordered a table full of dishes consisting of seafood, meat and vegetables and had our fill. All the customers had already left but we were still there eating, but the staff did not show their displeasure. They even came to refill our soups when it was about to go empty! We only paid about 200+ for 5 persons altogether! Extremely worth the price!Lovely staff and lovely food! Will definitely come back again
3
Have visited Coca on several occasions to other outlets and this is the first at this outlet to celebrate birthday.Food remained fresh and selection choices were good for lunch buffet.Had a reservation and informed the male staff who just walk to the nearest table next to the entrance, placed the menu on the table and walked away. Was not informed if that was the table being reserved. I was left standing by the entrance for 10mins before he came back and ask if this table was ok and moved to another table. Table was too close to entrance and there was not much walking space between the plant and the chair.When told the same male staff that we needed chicken soup instead of chicken/tom yum, he acknowledge but did not attempt to make the change. When we asked the second time, he told us he has no hands and not free to assist and walked away?! We had to ask another waitress to change the soup base.Staffs were not attentive here, had to call several times before sauce and water are refilled.We noticed another couple who was ushered to a table by this same male staff and no condiments nor utensils were setup at that table. They were then left alone and had to call for assistance. We overheard the waitress who went to assist complaining to anther waitress about that table.Staff seems to be lacking in communication and the male staff lack of customer service and basic training. He was also seen mainly seated at the entrance counter on his mobile phone. The female staffs were lacking but they provided alot better service than the male staff which made my meal a little more satisfactory
4
Went for a weekend dinner with family. It's a must to make a reservation in this restaurant if you are coming on weekends. It's usually very packed. The reservation timing seemed to be back to back. We reserved for 6pm and when we went to the restaurant, we were told that we had only 2 hours to eat. Need to vacate the table by 8pm. Well, it's a bit of a rush... won't be able to chi chat and take things slowly. Least the food there is delicious. Simply love the fish glue. :) A must try if there. Pricing wise is not cheap.
4
We ended in this restaurant because the first choice one we need to wait for more than 30 minutes but Coca is not a bad choice food wise after all. It was our Singapore based friend who selected most of the food served but when it came the food was superb.I have only one negative comment for the staff were not observant to the costumers for when we needed service it took time to call them for they were chatting with each other
4
Went to Coca for a family meal because the steamboat restaurant at Vivo City was fully booked on our last night in Singapore. Coca is not very atmospheric - a bit clinical with strong lighting and white furniture - but everything was clean and efficient. Fine for a family, but not for a romantic couple experience. We chose the 'buffet' option ($42++/28++) rather than a la carte, mostly because we found the latter too confusing. It meant that we could choose as much as we wanted off of a smaller menu. The food was varied and fresh, with seafood, meats, fish balls, wantons, vegies, noodles and some more unusual items like 'fish glue' and stuffed beancurd skin; with 2 types of stock. All very delicious. The staff were very friendly and helpful, although the drinks took a long time to arrive. Happy to recommend
