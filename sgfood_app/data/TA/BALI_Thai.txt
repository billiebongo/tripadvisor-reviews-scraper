Very good vegetarian menu, great service
There a lot of dishes to recommend; they have a huge selection of vegetarian items
Very modern restaurant and setting
Lovely place to go after a shopping day and very affordable prices
5
It is a family restaurant, located in a Mall. This place has a good combination of Indonesian and Thai food. I had satay, green curry, rice, noodles and Tom yum soup.This is place is not expensive. The food is tasty and ambience is nice.
3
The food wasn't reasonably priced and we had to spend quite a bit of time waiting for the food to arrive. 2 of us could order the same item and mine came 15 minutes later. I would probably try other Thai restaurants.
3
There are many better places to eat Thai food which was only average at best. Unlike many other restaurants in the centre there was no queue which says a lot.The seating was fine, the staff and service was polite and prompt which was the only thing giving the average feedback.I won't be rushing back.
4
We had lunch at the Bali Thai in Seletar Mall. It was clean and the service was prompt. We chose dishes offered from the Value lunch promotion. With an additional top up, you could select drinks and side dishes. The green chicken curry served with rice was a good choice. The gravy was thick and tasty. Another dish was the fish fillet with pineapple rice. The fillet pieces were crispy and there were generous bits of pineapple in the rice. I enjoyed the tauhu telor - fried beancurd and egg in a special sauce. Try the refreshing lemongrass drink. I would recommend this place to relax with family and friends over a meal.
3
Bali thai has well designed interior decor with ample seating space. The menu has a wide selection of vegetarian options. The staff was courteous.However we felt the cutlery was unclean and the pricing was higher than similar Thai restaurants. The portion sizes are quite small
4
I ordered 2 dishes, hoping to try a little of both in one meal. It didn't happen as I finished the first one completely due to its distinct yummy taste. The green curry chicken set with rice was definitely easy to like. It's instantly become a favorite of mine. The sauce was just right in terms of spiciness, and just like any good curry, it was a perfect match to steaming white rice. Plenty of chicken slices, tomatoes and other veggies inside this dish. I will recommend this dish anytime.The pad thai was also good. Noodles, chicken, bean sprouts, veggies and a slice of lime are good combination. I just made a mistake to mix in all of the chili powder which was included in the meal. Should have been packed separately in a sachet. Big mistake. Too spicy for me. In summary, take the green curry meal anytime, but be careful with the chili powder of the pad Thai
4
I was a bit skeptical to enter this place because on a typical weekend evening it was not much crowded as is visible in almost all restaurants in Singapore. But I was bowled by their hospitality and of course their dishes. The Thai Green Mango salad is mouth watering so were the rice platters of sweet and sour chicken and Thai Basil minced chicken. Prices were reasonable and the staff were extremely helpful. Had a great time
4
We arrived late lunch and the restaurant was not full anymore. We ordered tom yum soup for starter. The ginger is not so strong. I am not a fan of tom yum but i love their tom yum here. For the main course, the server suggested to order mixed BBQ platter which consists of chicken, shrimp, squid and fish which is good for sharing. Shrimp Paste fried rice is my favorite. We tried the pineapple rice as well but I didn't like it because i find it too sweet. The mixed vegetables with oyster sauce is just fine. There's nothing special. The crispy fried chicken is savoury! The service is fast and staff are friendly. I will definitely come back
5
Cheap and delicious with great service, definitely recommend eating here. Great selection of dishes cooked to your liking
4
First time lunch in bali thai at causeway point with colleague from US. Selection of foods is quite broad and food portion is reasonable.. Maybe they should serve the appettizer before the main course
4
Good Thai food in a nice place and clean place. Peaceful environment for a lunch or dinner. Well cooked
3
The foods in this restaurant are good, especially for tom yum soup lovers. However, the quality of services are low as some of the staffs are unfriendly and showing the "black face"(unhappy face).
4
Enjoyable meal at West Mall, Bukit Batok. Good service, good food. Recommended for anyone and it's often quiet in there which is nice.
3
This is yet another restaurant that offers Thai and Indonesian dishes. This location was at 83 Punggol Central #B1-13, Waterway Point, Singapore 878761.This is a open concept kind of restaurant.There are a wide range of popular dishes that diners could opt from their sections like Appetizers, Salads, Soups, Rice and Noodles, Main Courses, Vegetables, Desserts and Drinks.This restaurant also provide catering and delivery services too.They are opened daily from 11.30 am to 10.00pm.
4
Dinner with a friend who lives in Singapore and it was very good. Pad Thai and Nasi Goering for mains were delicious and the fish cakes for entree had lots of flavor. Shame the drinks list was so limited. Would recommend for a very good and reasonably priced dinner.
4
It has been a while since I ate at Bali Thai. This outlet is my first visit. There seemed to be new items and there are small portions available. I ordered a single bowl of tom yum seafood soup, basil chicken with lettuce from the appetiser section and the mango salad. All three items were enough for me. I did not have rice as I would like to have a good balance of fruits, vegetables and some proteins. Mango salad was nice, not too salty.Tom yum soup would be better with fish in there instead of mussels
4
Went there to break fast with my partner and she was very pleased with how attentive the staff were. Despite being crowded, they took the time to render excellent service to our table. Food was great and well worth the money. The Mango Mexicana was so good I ordered it a second time. Second one was a little too salty though. All in all, a pleasant meal. Will be back.
4
My 1st visit to BALI Thai at Causeway point yesterterday on 6 March 2016 was a pleasant one. The pre odered food was a very creative and productive way to avoid slow serving. We received our food minutes after we sat at our table. Serving was fast within 15 mins in which we have ordered quite a number of dishes. Staff especially the Supervisor Mr William was very friendly and helpful towards his staffs and customers. Food quality was good. The space constraint is the only setback or else it could have been a better place to dine
2
I ordered pinapple rice with prawn or chicken. I received rice in a plate pinapple's shape with only 2 prawns. Nothing to say but deceivers, pinapple had to be cut in the rice, I couldn't eat any pinapple at all.
4
the quality of food has not failed us so far. been to 3 of their outlets, serangoong, rws and seletar mall. . the staff are quite prompt and pleasant too.
3
Food was generally good but just a tad too salty for me. Must try the seafood glass noodles cooked with phad thai sauce.
3
Good for a quick-fx of indonesiga-thai food. Standardised food preparation from central kitchen. Typical poor service crew, like most F&B joints.
4
I love this place for its great food.. Have been here herw times, not even once i came across anyone complaining for food..Great vegetarian options.. I love Bkk stirred fried riceThai green curryVeg Tom yam soup Black olive ricePhad thai ..Everything is great.. Love the ambience as well..
5
I was under the impression that Thai restaurants would serve vegetarian dishes just to cater to on-off cases and largely cater to Non-veg section. I was pleasantly surpsied that Bali Thai not only serves proper vegetarian dishes, they have separate menu card and pleanty of options too!Tom Yum veg soup was served in pot which was unique. Thai Green Mango salad was just perfect to what I wan looking for - spicy, sweet, sour and very refreshing!Thai Green curry and Pineapple rice made the meal wholesome!Overall excellent experience and can surely make a family visit now
2
You can go in and enjoy many different flavours of thai food but in my experience the food has never been good enough to it's satisfactory. You could go in and grab a quick bite but you would never find something to see what you imagined it as
4
Scrumptious served piping hot. Lovely set lunches and dinner available too. Outstanding veg options. One of the few restaurants in Singapore with so much veg to choose from. It is a chain . Service is good and quick too. They even offer to pack you a doggy bag if you have lot of leftover food. Portions sizes in soups are large
4
Visited Singapore and my cousin who Ives there took us here one night! Surprisingly good spot for a small restaurant inside a mall. Although, I did realize that there's plenty of great restaurants inside a mall in Singapore. Food was mostly great. Our server was wonderful and very attentive! Pretty satisfied with all the dishes we ordered. Only thing about the food that I didn't like was the small portion sizes!
4
Bali Thai is a little hard to find on the 2nd floor.The Tom Yum soup is really good along with many of their other dishes.  We came in a large group.  The food was fast, tasted great, and was very fresh.  The fruit and coffee drinks are all excellent.  However the Thai Ice Coffee was not as strong as I am accustomed to.Tip:  Bali Thai does not serve Alcohol.  If you want a beer, go next door.  But make sure you still eat at Bali Thai - not to be missed
2
We dined here only because there was a separate vegetarian menu. However, every dish we ordered stinked of meat, seafood. Was very difficult to even taste. Most staff weren't aware if same oil was used for veg/ meat. Will not go back.
4
Good quality food ( but oily ) and but the restaurant seems out of interest. No one at the door to take u inside the restaurant even though it is written 'pls wait for us'
3
The food is generally good, and consistent. Ordered the seafood tom yam soup (the seafood was fresh), fried kai lan, stuffed chicken wings (crispy and tasty) and olive rice. All dishes were cooked well and served hot.
4
Reasonably priced, food is authentic in taste, service hospitable - will come again especially during lunch time
3
My wife and I both chose to eat from the Noodle bar. Nice idea, pick meat, pick noodles, pick sauce.The noodles and the sauce were both very good, for both of us. The glass noodles were great, along with the peanut sauce, and the Pad Thai noodles were good in the Pad Thai sauce (not enough spice though). The Prawns, were not very good, and the grilled chicken was almost inedible
4
Went there for just impromptu lunch. Food ws great for value. We walked out really full. Try the Tofu hotplate and Cumi Bakar(Grilled squid) Coconut juice was yummy too. Staff was polite and quick in taking orders. Place was great, not crowded great for family and friends meals
3
This a review of the outlet at the newly opened Seletar Mall. Though there were quite a few waiters, service was quite slow on weekends perhaps because of the crowd. Price of dishes is relatively reasonable though portions are small so it is not really value-for-money. This is particularly so with regards to their Stir-fried Kai Lan ($9) which consisted of only a few miserable stalks of leaves and to my dismay, was not piping hot when served but tasted quite cold. I suspect it was lying in the kitchen and no one bothered to bring it to our table. (To his credit, the manager did not charge me for it when I complained).The Thick Seafood Pot was too starchy and was surprisingly tasteless. We ended up adding the Stir Fried Kai Lan's sauce into it to enhance the taste. The 6pcs of Satay Madura ($9.80) was passable. I like their Hotplate Seafood Tofu ($13) and Thai Fish Otak ($9). However would have preferred it slightly spicy. We had opted for the non-spicy version because Bali-Thai restaurant (unlike other Thai, Indonesian restaurants) only allows customers to choose their dishes either spicy or non-spicy. We could not ask for less-spicy as according to them, the chilli is already pre-made. This is quite an absurd explanation (if one can even call that an explanation, more like an excuse!). And it appears to be daylight robbery to charge $1.50++ for a bowl of white rice! And the laughing matter was we had to wait quite long for them to cook the rice because apparently they had run out of white rice right smack in the middle of dinner time. It certainly seemed to me as if the restaurant is not quite ready to function as a professional eating establishment
4
Hard to believe, but this restaurant has a separate menu just for the vegetarians!The food is delicious, especially the tom-yum soup, the thai green curry or the fried rice. The portions are moderate in size and should be enough if you have the complete meal with soup, main course, dessert and a drink.This particular outlet is always almost crowded during the dining hours and I sometimes even had to wait in the line for about 30mins
3
Good news is that the service was wonderful. Aided by the great idea of providing a menu, and allowing the customer to jot down what they want on an invoice pad, and then the waiter takes that and puts in the order. The food, well, it's missing the truly authentic lemon grass and chili of true Thai food. I do like they let you build your own type of noodle entree, but not pad see ew? My friend had the pineapple fried rice, and said it was fine, just not great. He also had the sampler appetizer tray, and said the spring rolls, satay, and shrimp toast were all descent. I had the beef and chicken satay, and both were fine, though the beef was a bit overcooked and tough. The chicken satay was missing that peanut taste, and in defense, I didn't use the peanut sauce (I'm use to it being infused into the meat), so maybe that's what it was, but it was quite tendered, and the chicken perfectly cooked. I also had the honey chicken, which I never knew was a Thai dish (always been a Chinese dish that I've known). It was just okay, and was a bit shocked to have to pull out some tendon after biting into a few of the pieces. The Dracula juice was excellent also. I will say, the overall price wasn't hugely disappointing, but around $65 local for average Thai food seems a bit steep, but there in goes the motto of Singapore.....
4
The food served at Bali Thai is tasty but I wish the portion size is bigger for the price I paid. The tahu telur I ordered from Nex outlet tasted abit off and the tahu telur crust is darker than usual. I suspect that the oil for deep-frying had been reused many times contributing to the off-flavour and darker crust. Nonetheless, the restaurant is very cosy with cushion seats and soothing music. It is definitely a great place for family gatherings and romantic couple time
3
Food is tasty but we feel that price is a bit on the high side for the portion we received. Restaurant is cozy though and staff is helpful.
3
Nice to eat food. Price you pay is reasonable for restaurant. But food becomes cold too quickly, maybe its the aircon.
Should change the variety of food more often.
3
Overall taste is good but lack in variety. Perhaps I was too picky of the menu choices. But nonetheless, thai food lovers must try them out
3
Wide variety of Thai and Indonesian food. Set in a classy environment, one will be spolit for choice. Value for money.
4
dishes are nice and service crews are very friendly.
just only the waiting time for the food to come is alittle slow, but worth it! prices are reasonable too
would advise to visit the one in NEX
4
I had dinner at 112 Katong on Mothers day. Though the restaurant was packed, the food was served pretty quick. The food was good, spicy and the vegetarian options were good.
4
Ate at the bali thai at I12 katong mall. Loved their jungle noodle..was spicy and kickass! The pad thai was a bit dry..but the green and red curries more than made up for it. Great food..good service.
4
We have been to Bali Thai a number of times and it is one of my favourite reasonably priced asian restaurants. The green curry is fantastic and the pad thai tastes like the ones I had in Thailand. They have fantastic options for drinks which taste as good as they sound. This is a favourite with the whole family
4
Our first visit to Bali Thai was in 2012. In Katong I12. My teenage kids had difficulty selecting their choice of food because there were too many choices. When the food arrived, we enjoyed the food thoroughly. We went to the outlet in Nex some time back. The menu serves a good variety of Indonesain and Thai food. Delicious but some of the portions are small
4
3 of us had dinner at BaliThai West Mall. The staff was courteous with my pregnant wife. We ordered the papaya salad, Bali ayam panggang, and tahu telur.The tahu telur and ayam panggang were really good. The papaya salad was so so.We would definitely come back for the tahu telur and to try other dishes
4
This is a good place to enjoy good food and the closest thing to Thai eating in Singapore. Try it and enjoy the food. Will definitely go again.
4
I was there during ITB Asia, so the restaurant was full 100% and I and my friend should be waiting until we get a table.Finally we get our table and ordered our foods. The staff was very helpful but they look very busy due to all table are full !The food was delicious and the drink was good too. Anyway dishes match their pric
5
We had visited Bali Thai at the Novena Square. We had one entree eggplant in some lovely sauce and then two mains, my was noodles with chicken and satay sauce and my husband had satay sticks. The beef satay sticks were absolutely amazing. We enjoyed our food a lot, the dragon drink was amazing. The service was excellent and the waitress was very funny
4
Located on Sentosa Isalnd, and amongst all the restaurants which are mostly overpriced crap, such as Chillis and Hard Rock...this little gem shines brightly.Simple concept: like the name, Food from Bali and from Thailand.Ordered an appetizer and main dish from Bali.Both were excellent, good size portions.Main Dishes cost 9-12 SGD.Had a frozen mango drink with the meal which did the job in relaxing my mouth from the spicy dishes.Will come back when at Sentosa
3
I went to the outlet at Causeway Point and it was near closing time but they still allowed us to order. Service and food was alrights but staff could be more attentive to customers. Generous portion for the mango sticky rice.Check out my mango sticky rice hunt at http://nkikichua.blogspot.sg/2013/09/food-hunt-best-mango-sticky-rice-in.htm

I had dinner with my wife recently at the Suntec outlet. We were there early - just after 5pm. Only about 4 - 5 tables occupied - not very crowded. Our comments:1. Our food took more than 20mins to arrive after we ordered. 2. Rice was not served with the dishes. We waited for a while and finally decide to call for the rice. I would have thought, the standard practice is for the rice to come with the first dish. 3. We ordered warm lemon grass drink. When it came to us the drink was cool. We had to get them to warm up the drink.4. For dessert - we were told by the first waiter that all their desserts are cold ones. A few minutes later, another server came to say one of the dessert can be served warm. It took almost half hour and repeated reminding before the dessert finally came to us. The dessert was not even warm. What made it worse was that the dessert had coconut milk and it was cold. We again had to request them to heat it up. While the food quality was reasonable, the service level left much to be desired.Our meal took almost 1.5hrs !! I reckon that under normal circumstances considering that the restaurant was not crowded, the whole meal could be done in half that time
2
Went to he Bali Thai in Suntec and the service was so lost. We went on the 3rd of August 2013 about 7pm. We did not get our drinks for like 45 minutes after we placed our order. Secondly I went with my family husband and three children. One of my children got her order of friend rice well before everyone else on the table. My husband and I got ours about 8.30pm while my last two children got theirs about 9pm. Our orders were mixed up, we were served fish fillet when we requested for chicken and we ordered two appetizers and only got one. To make matters worse, they charged us for two appetizers i had to correct them. Terrible terrible service not worth a second visit at al
4
This is one of the finest restaurant in Singapore with spicy food. We had New year dinner here in 2013. Me and my sister's family. The dishes were good, environment was good and service was up to the mark. We have completer satisfaction of a complete dinner.The prices are bit higher but compare to other Singapore restaurant and compare to the quality and test of the food its acceptable
3
Went to the outlet at Suntec. Bustling during lunch, we thought it must be pretty good considering cheaper options from the nearby food court. Staff were relatively young & inexperienced (some looked fresh out of school, chinese kids in a Thai-Indon restaurant didn't add to the atmosphere) - when we asked if a dish served as a set could be served ala-carte style ie. larger portion minus rice, immediate response was no. When we insisted, then only the waiter said he'd check with the kitchen to which they said do-able. We initially ordered 4 dishes incl tomyum and thought enough for 3 ladies. When we saw the portions, we added 1 more dish. Did they only have 1 serving size ie. small? Would a large group be forced to ordered multiple portions of 1 dish for sake of everyone having a taste? Tomyum was spicy and reasonably tasty. Beef with basil was so-so. Longbeans with salted egg yolk and cumi bakar (grilled calamari) were the highlights. Green curry chicken was oddly sweet. Lemongrass drink was so-so. It wasn't cheap eating here but I guess it's a change from foodcourt fare
1
My only time dining at Bali Thai turned out to be my last. This happened at the outlet at Suntec City. It was quite obvious to me as I stood at the entrance of the restaurant waiting to be shown a table that the outlet was facing a severe shortage of manpower. Nonetheless, I was quickly ushered in.The menu was a mix of Indonesian and Thai food, a perfect combination as both cuisines offered spicy dishes. Time stood still at this outlet because everything seemed to happen at a snail's pace. From the ordering of the food to the serving of the food, it was a good 30 minutes from the time the food order was placed to the eventual serving of the dishes. In my opinion, service was deplorable. May I also suggest the service personnel let us know of the dishes when they are placed on our table. I was left wondering if the size of the dish I ordered was correct.In summary, unless you are desperate for a dose of Indo-Thai dishes, avoid this outlet at all costs
4
Newly renovated Bali Thai in Suntec City. Nice food, cool deco.
A good mix of thai and indonesian cuisine. Great place for family get to gather where family members can agree on the 2 types of most preferred cuisine.
3
Was at the outlet at 112 Katong for lunch. Quality of food was so-so (prefer the food at Thai Express) but service and ambience were not bad (in comparison to Thai Express @ Parkway). Not likely to eat there again....
2
Had lunch on 12 July with three other people, the Iced Tea was horrendous and we had to add more milk and Sugar just to get the tea down our throats.The food was far from tasty, it was bland though the presentation was OK.There was no flavor in the food, obviously no passion when cooked, it was, just "another dish" we felt.We asked for Chopsticks ( it should have been placed on the table - but obviously not!), it took another 3 min for the waiter to bring it, all the while the food was getting cold.I think it would be good to get the Chef to the table before ordering, at least he would know what we want and explaining to the waiter, as we did while ordering, would not suffice.Overall, the restaurant did not live up to the Hype and expectations I felt, it would have been better to move to the Food republic and have a quick meal
3
Good mix of Thai and Balinese food.The Tom Yum soup is Yum. You can create your own noodle and sauce mix, which can be adventurous.Service is pretty average.If you are shopping, hungry, and don't want to spend a whole lot on lunch, this place is acceptable
2
We went to their Causeway point outlet in Woodlands.Saturday 6 pmOrders were taken promptly and repeated 3xWater came after 10 minutes.The food for my wife came after 20 minutes. Medium fast food quality.the food for our 3 kids came 20 minutes later, they had in the mean time finished the food of my wife. Quality was ok.My food came after another 15 minutes, and it looked old and heated up. I sent it back, paid and went to Mc Donalds.I was stunned by the chaos in the kitchen, the staff told me, there was only one chef and it was getting very thight in the kitchen.Smply not worth the money or the time
2
Went to Bali Thai in the basement of ION. Took 45 minutes for them to deliver my meal - folks around me had come, ordered, eaten, and gone in that time, yet the wait staff insisted my meal was still being prepared. In the end, very disappointing Pad Thai arrived, obviously thrown together in a hurry
4
I had dinner with 4 friends. We arrived quite late, around 9 pm since the meeting we had finished late. Although we were there quite late but the service from the retaurant was very good. We got our orders in timely manner, even for our additional beverages. The staffs were also very helpfula nd nice. The taste of the foods were also beyond our expectation. All the 5 of us were satisfied
2
We visited this place after a tiring day to enjoy good meal as me and my husband, we love thai cuisine. The foodd tasted awesome ans preparation was nice. HOWEVER...we had to wait for good 25 mins when the tables were available. .once seated while ordering we requested a glass of water which was not served until I had to get up and walk to the reception and request again. They served us the soup but bowls came after 15 mins for which had to request again...I really dont know what were the waiters so busy with. Place was damn noisy but thats ok..would not recommend it if u are hungry and would like to enjoy ur meal..
4
As a series of my thai food cravings one afternoon I decided to try this Bali Thai restaurant and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered Thai green chicken curry and their fresh mango shake. My hungry tummy was then satisfied, The curry is delicious and creamy the portion is filling I can see a lot of chicken and fresh vegetables. My order took only a minute since I only order one meal. The place is ok staff are attentive. Price is very affordable
1
I came here with my hubby and we wanted to get the Thai experience. We ordered a few things to get a taste of everything. We first ordered the combination appetizer which included satay, egg rolls and some sort of balled meat. The satay and the egg roll were pretty good but the balled meat was awful. I then wanted to try the friend prawn cakes. It was alright but nothing big. I for entree I ordered the pad Thai with chicken and satay sauce. I was terrible disappointed ... No where on the menu did it say that it was going to come little bits of veggies and bean sprouts.. Tons on bean sprouts it was disgusting and scrambled eggs mushed in there .. I hate egg. I was soo disappointed with my order. Serve was ok. Nobody came by to check on us and ask if everything was alright but they made sure our food came out and the Check came right away. For a drink I had a sparkling Dracula which is sprite with raspberry syrup.. Sweet And pretty good. My husband ordered pad Thai with seafood And chili sauce. He loved it. His drink was lemon iced tea and he said it was soo sweet you couldn't taste anything else but the sugar. Overall experience was not even worth the one star for terrible. I would not recommend to anyone At al
3
We went for lunch on a Monday and it was quite empty. staff nice and attentive, food was good, nicely marinated and well seasoned, drinks also as expected. we'll come back.
4
Went to the Katong 112 BaliThai branch. First impressions was good, the servers were friendly and welcoming. Ordered a pot of Tom Yum soup, fried rice and pad thai. The soup was a little too spicy for me but the rice and pad thai are absolutely delicious.I will definitely return to 112 branch to try the Nasi Goreng and desserts soon
2
I went to Bali Thai in the ION center, and was hugely disappointed in their menu, and the staff. I didn't catch anyone's names, but except for the one person who delivered my food (not the person I ordered from, or the person I paid) everyone was very distracted and almost rude. The restaurant wasn't busy enough for them to be distracted by too many patrons, but no one checked to see if my food was okay, or even refilled my water glass the entire time I was there. I ordered the fried spring rolls, which were passable, but nothing special. And the Phad Thai. I was so excited to have phad thai again, because it's been months since I'd had it. This was down right... bad. Almost flavorless until I squeezed the lime over it, and the chicken. Ick. I ordered a chicken filet. What came out were chunks of thigh, and wing meat, and some dark meat pieces, and it actually tasted bad. When I went to pay the woman behind the counter took my bill, told me the amount, but then proceeded to deal with another customer at a table (I was standing at the cashier, so she had to leave the desk to go to the table) although I already had the money ready and was handing it to her. I definitely wont be going back, and I don't know if any of Katrina Holdings' businesses will get any business from me
4
Had lunch with 7 of my Singaporean friends at Bali Thai. Service was quite good! Our waitress, well it was her first day on the job and she did a great job! Got our order correct and in a timely manner. The prawn cakes were so good, the green curry delicious and the lime drink a winner. It was very busy at lunch........that's usually a good sign
1
I like going to Bali Thai each time am in Singapore. But my last visit to Bali Thai (Feb 1st) was so disappointing. We were there for lunch (there were 4 of us). Ordered grilled seafood platter, Tofu, 2 types of veg. We got our seafood and tofu very fast but the vegetable we got served after 50 minutes and after we kept on asking for 4 times. Drinks we had to wait around half hour before we were served. Serving is going down the drain. Not sure what's going on but after my last experienced, I will not recommend anyone no unless you are willing to wait for your orders
1
We had combo platter to share as starter (15$) 3 pcs of Spring rolls stuffed with carrots & turnips, Fish cake ( The waitress explained, "Fish moe and chili paste ) What's a moe ? When I asked her what was it or if it's roe and not moe, she said it's moe. something from Fish skin ! ( Eeww ! ),3 pcs of rice cracker & 3 sticks of Chicken satay which was a tad overcook ( The peanut sauce was bland ). For main we had, Fried rice with beef and basil ( 9.50$ ), Shrimp paste fried rice ( 8.80$ ) ( Both was recommended by the waitress as 'very spicy' but was not at all ) and Traditional Java Chicken soup also known as Soto Ayam. Both rice was tasteless, the fried rice with beef and basil was just blacked with soy sauce, only few slices of beef and too much basil but no basil taste or smell, the shrimp paste rice was fried rice with 3 thinly slices of omelette, shrimp and chili padi on the side. Worst fried rice ever. Lastly we had the Soto Ayam. This is how I will describe it, Turmeric infused, watered down insipid Chicken soup !! ( In it, shredded Chicken, egg and glass noodles )We will not come back. The beef fried rice at Teh Tarik ( Blk 201 Tampines St 22 coffee shop taste better, alot better ! 
1
I used to patronize BaliThai Tampines Mall until my recent visit (Dec 23rd, 2012). The service was very slow. I was about to place my order when the waitress realized that she had no pen, so she went to grab a pen and turned out that it wasn't working. Hence, she went over the counter to grab another pen and at the time, another customer raised his hand; which apparently caused her to divert her attention and forgot that she was supposed to take my orders. We ordered Seafood Tom Yum, Seafood hotplate with Japanese Tofu, and Nasi Goreng. The Tom Yum tastes like it had too much coconut milk, the Nasi Goreng is the worse one. It had one piece of beef, and taste like left over rice. The manager didn't even want to compensate for the nasi goreng. It was a terrible experience.. Worse ever and the food wasn't even that good
5
My friend and I have been going to BaliThai in Katong 112 almost every week but we're both moving back to our home countries and we'll miss it! The green chicken curry is great and I always get the chicken and eggplant with basil and chili, delicious. Excellent service, especially by Peter, he always remembers us and our order and is probably the best restaurant person I've ever dealt with

Bali Thai - novena square. Was satisfied with the variety of food. Sotong Chilli and Tom yum was spicy and nice. Grilled chicken was great. Stuffed chicken wings were finger licking good. Tahu telur was also tasty. Staff were generally polite. I really enjoyed the food but IMHO the pricing is steep so okay for a special occasion. :

The menu has option for either thai or Indonesia food. Choosesd Thai food only. For the Tom yum gai soup,it doesn't taste better than a 5dollar one which could be taken at a food court everywhere. Seafood mix plate is ok.Totally cost 85 for 2p, which is a reasonable price in Singapore for an inside door dine. But about the food,just average,if u r from shanghai,u must know Simply Thai,just that level,not bad not good
