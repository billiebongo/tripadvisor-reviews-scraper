Used to be the go to spot for coffee. But the service has been on a downward decline. Plain rude - made the good flat white with a sour aftertaste.

A really homely coffee outlet that delivers good quality coffee. Love the scones & jam as well. A huge area is dedicated for coffee workshop. Very interesting retail section with t shirts, coffee mugs and colorful cup holders. Most of the time is crowded and not easy to find parking if your are driving. However, it's worth the trouble to get a car park just for a cup of heavenly coffee.

Been visiting Yahava since it opened a couple of years back. Used to be brilliant, but over the years not so much. Coffee's still good (last time was better), but service is the pits now. They used to have really awesome and passionate staff, but those there now look and act like they can't wait to find a better job.

good coffee, lots of tables, but the level of noise in the place can get to deafening levels cos of all the hard walls, & boy it's a horror house sometimes when families bring horrible kids there. for a coffee place, it's also amusing that the owner goes to extraordinary lengths to block the use of the power sockets, by taping them up better than what was done to the egyptian mummies. i find that disgusting, cos it shows how stingy you are... like how much power can i draw charging my phone

Coming from Australia, these guys really know how to make a PERFECT cup of coffee every time. And every day they have a different bean from another micro farm some place in the world. Walking in you see a big roasting machine that can be noisy during operation, but you know this place is the real deal! Favorite bean is Romeo no.5. Great place to chill, but wifi provided, perhaps to avoid leeching and overstayers.

Nestled in a fairly quiet neighbourhood. Coffee is good, pastries are above average, car Parks can be a hassle even though a public car park is nearby. Fairly big shop and with great airconditioning, it's a nice place to cool down with a cuppa. I especially like the area at the back of the shop where it's nice and cold and away from the glaring sunlight & equatorial heat. Music selection is nice but can be noisy when fully occupied. Nice place to hang out, read a book. Nothing reall

Coffee was fine, only just fine....but service was sub-par, and that's putting it mildly. Ordered our food but it was given to someone else who came after us. And as we waited for our order and coffee, the staff even found time to have his own cup of coffee in the meantime....At least he was aware, offering a half-hearted mumble of an apology afterwards when we finally collected our order....just a mumble....Drove all this way for average coffee, disappointing service....not coming back...

Whilst at a nearby sports venue, we popped out to get lunch.Spotted this place on maps and noticed good reviews.Coffee gets the 5 stars. Food (quesadillas and pork lasagna) filling but not as enjoyable. Spacious place with coffee paraphanalia around and a relaxed environment. Would return if in the area again

Aromatic coffee and delicious waffles! There are also scones, cakes and savoury sandwiches! Perfect for a weekend getaway from the crowded city. The place smells heavenly with coffee beans roasting in the large roaster they have. Staff is friendly and wiling to help.

This is a cool coffee shop with a trendy vibe. The coffee is very good and they roast it onsite. The staff are friendly and they have also me good looking food, but I didn't eat this - will next time!

I visit this cafe at least once a month, they offer great coffee with reasonable price, sandwich and cake are tasty too!
Noon time can be crowded and it still a good place to chill over the weekend.

One of the best coffee I had for a while. A business associate brought me there and fell in love with the coffee; craze for it and brought my wife the next day.Cozy environment and atmosphere to hang out with loved one and friends...The service is good and staff are polite and service oriented. As my wife was not able to make up her mind on her coffee; the service staff was fast to introduce and recommend her.... A flat white which is nice and smoothing...Can't wait to go and enjoy my next coffee over the weekend

Came here for a coffee after a morning of hiking around Macritchie reservoir. The location is quite inconvenient, but it's worth the effort as the coffee is amongst the best you'll get in Singapore. And it's not very crowded, probably because of the location. Well worth a visit
5
Full stars for my favourite coffee place in Singapore. This is a place which you go strictly for the coffee. I am not vouching for the food which happens to be limited in variety. My favourite beans include X-rated (or was it triple X?), Dark Gold and Romeo. Give me a skinny flat white please

We go to Yahava occasionally to enjoy the coffee, which is one of the better ones that we have come across in Singapore, after meals at the nearby hawker center or some of the eateries a short drive or walk away. We prefer to sit next to the window to enjoy the view of the park and of pets and their owners as they visit the veterinary centre next door. What brings us back, besides the coffee, is the ambience, which is a combination of the soothing lighting and decor, the natural sunlight and unobstructed view when seated next to the window, the faint smell of pastries and the choice of music
5
We have been here many times, and the coffee is consistently excellent. We love the ambience here, and the aromatic fragrance of roasted coffee bean greets us each time we enter.A pity that there is limited food options here (but they seem to be slowly introducing more foods), so we usually have our breakfast at the nearby food centre, before heading here to chill out. It is usually pretty quiet in the morning :

If coffee is your poison, you'll like Yahava. This is a local franchisee of the Yahava KoffeeWorks in Margaret River. They import a simile blend of coffee beans as their HQ down under and some times curiousity from elsewhere in small batches. This place is more of a wholesale importer and roaster rather than your usual cafe. So, the down side is there is not a large choice of accompanying food. Besides the coffee, the laid back ambience in a spacious homely set up makes for an excellent (though minimalistic) cafe away from the city

So good for coffee, comfy seating, you don't feel like you are seated on top of each other and really great setting and ambience as an earlier reviewer has mentioned. I wish I lived closer to this place. I've yet to try any meals however, the banana bread was good. I have only one complaint Yahava, open up early on a weekend and do breakfasts!
