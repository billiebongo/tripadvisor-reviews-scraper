This place can get really busy. Not because the food is great but not much options around the area after you pass the gardens. Food variety is good and halal options available too. Reasonably priced for a tourist place.
5
We had delicious satays there, with some white carrot cake and laksa
If you are looking to try Singaporean street food then this is a place to go.

The Marina Bay BBQ Steamboat Buffet.
Upon arrival they asked weather we had reservation we said no. Overall the food was great,plus they had. A local potong ice cream,only for the diners eating at their place. The staff were friendly.
5
Had Satay, BBQ Chicken Wings, Popiah and Rojak.
All were really nice and washed down with a nice cold beer.
Reasonably priced and good selection of food.
5
A great find to savour Singapore street food in one place at amazing prices -near the Gardens by the by and especially after the amazing show... relaxed venue with authentic food
2
Nice setting but the food is not as great by local standard and the pricing is higher than average.
Not really worth to eat there.
3
It was really busy...so be prepared. Food was average, i tried some chicken,prawn and beef satay from city satay. And prawn fried rice and water spinach from another stall that i cant remember the name of. They really like spicy food, watch out what you are ordering to avoid regrets.

This food centre, stylised as a hawker centre in the standard Singaporean style, has loads of tasty looking options to choose from and I really enjoyed my char kway teow and cold pint of Tiger. Decent prices too, although I did think that the buildings looked a little tired and shabby in comparison with the rest of the Gardens by the Bay, which are pretty immaculate. It's a little way away from the other garden destinations, past the children's garden, but is well worth the walk
4
Restaurants in the garden is not such special and have a long waiting line to get in. So it's better to have lunch here and look around the garden. This is kind of a food center, mostly satay but still has various food from number of countries. The service is not excellent but ok
3
Good local hawker food nestled behind Gardens By The Bay. As well as obviously serving satay, you’ll pretty much find most other style of local hawker food here from Chinese seafood and crab dishes, to Indian, Malay, Thai, western and even Turkish. There’s also a bar so you can enjoy a pint or two. Overall the quality of the food is good, but I wouldn’t say great. The satay and grill seafood are especially good, but the price is a little more than other local places, but that’s understandable given the location. Surrounded by lush vegetation and overlooking marina bay, it is a nice place to come and enjoy some good food and drinks. It is a little out of the way, but it is worth it if you’re looking for a hawker with a bit of character.
5
While down at gardens by the bay you should get some satay here. Good service. Great flavour and a good price. You can get cheaper elsewhere but when you are here and you are hungry, this is where to go.
4
My partner and I came here based on a recommendation in our travel book and it was as described. There are many different food stalls (including Mediterranean and other Asian specialties aside from satay) but we came for the name! We chose our own portions as we wanted variety but were not hungry enough for 10 portions each of chicken, beef and prawns. We ordered from the first stall on the left side when you enter from the riverside (across from the Mediterranean place). Service was prompt and the satay was very nice. The beef was best, chicken was nice and the prawns were a bit over cooked for our taste.We also ordered two baby BBQ octopus satays from the last stall on the left side (a few stalls down from the other one we ate from). These were tasty although a bit sweeter than we expected. They were cooked very well.It was an enjoyable experience but a little bit of a splurge for the price.
4
On the south end of the gardens, you will find this Hawker Center. We ate at City Satay (twice) and it was great satay with a yummy, little sweet, sauce. All of the meat was awesome, great street food for a great price. Worth the walk to a more quiet part of the park
5
Satay By The Bay is a good choice for meals if you visit Gardens By The Bay. Otherwise it is about 15mins walk from Marina Bay Sands. Not too bad as it is quite a nice walk. There are halal and non-halal options from the various food stalls here. If you are looking for halal options, Sri Geylang Sate offers the best satay you can find. Must try! However, do note the opening hours varies according to stalls
4
I went at lunchtime, and not many stalls were open, in fact, they were only just setting up so had to wait around while the grills were heated up with charcoal. Still it was good to sit with a cool fruit juice and watch all the activity.It's not that close to Bayfront MRT station, but if you are visiting Gardens by the Bay then it's definitely worth the 10-15 min walk.Once you are there, it's a fairly typical hawker-type setup. Ceiling fans to create a breeze, communal tables, satay vendors with their hot charcoal grills around the edge. Lots of special offers are available, loads of different types of satay (chicken, beef. pork etc) and the one I had was very good indeed. Small chunks of chicken BBQ'd on a skewer and served with a delicious satay sauce. I'd imagine there would be a much better atmosphere if you went in the evening but it's perfectly fine for lunch too (just don't get there too early!)
5
A good option in GbtB. Came here for dinner after catching the 7:45PM Garden Symphony show.The satay here was a bit different (round and flat rice cakes, sambal instead of peanut sauce?) and I wasn't used to it. But the crispy noodles and coconut juice were really, really good. The drinks stall here sells 2 Liter towers of sugarcane juice, which I really wanted to try but couldn't. Those towers are reason enough to dine here imho
4
We were at Gardens by the Bay so came here after our visit. It’s a fair walk from the main Centre and it does not offer views but there is ample choice at cheap prices. The juice bar and fried carrot cake were good as were the stay. We got 30 pieces for $34. A bargain!
4
This open-air hawker centre is a fair trek from the main areas of the Gardens but it is worth the walk. We were there during the day and it was not crowded. The satays were very tasty - a first experience of a hawker centre for my relatives from Europe and they thoroughly enjoyed the food and the casual dining concept of a hawker centre
4
Satay By The Bay is a fantastic place to dine in if you are craving for hawker food in the town area such as Marina Bay. It is a 10-min walk from Garden By The Bay and 20-min walk from Bayfront MRT. You can take a Uber/Grab from Marina Bay Sands if you are too tired from all the shopping. It has many food to enjoy such as satay, oyster omelette, fried rice, fried hokkien mee, BBQ Stingray, desserts, BBQ Chicken Wings. Do not go from 7-8pm as it will be crowded and hard to find seats during dinner time as there are limited seat available for patrons
2
I’d been before & was looking forward to the delicious green veggie dish called Morning Glory I think, however in this occasion what I considered to be a vegetarian option turned out to have a huge slug in it. I showed the plate to the vendor who was also horrified. Not sure if this place has food hygiene ratings as do vendors at Newton’s but the cook just shrugged & told waitress/vendor to refund my money. You can’t really see the bay from this place. Well I couldn’t - admittedly didn’t stop to sample anything more than the local beer which was good. I had thought it was a handy place to stroll to after visiting gardens by the bay - may try something somewhere else maybe
4
Had stop over after completing a bike frm East Coast. Ordered Satay Pork and Stingray. Need to order again another set of Satay Pork, i want the Satay Sauce.
4
Satay by the Bay is located in the gardens precinct adjacent to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It is convenient for visitors to the Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Barrage, both of which are worthwhile visiting, and about a 10 minute walk from either.It is a well laid out hawker centre with convenient toilet facilities. Tables are spaced out under large ceiling fans and food stalls organised around a couple of island arrangements.There is a range of street food offerings that would appeal to locals as well as visitors, nothing exotic but a good cross section of hawker fare in a slightly more upmarket setting. Pricing is at a premium to other food-courts and hawker centres but not unreasonably so.The quality of the food is comparable to most but there is nothing outstanding that would justify the trip for a meal out there unless you are already in the vicinity or looking to show some visitors around. The variety of food stalls on offer has obviously been carefully selected..There are a number of satay stalls, and it is a good place to sample the local version of this popular street food. There are halal (beef, mutton and chicken, no pork) and non-halal stalls selling satay. If you have no objections to eating pork, I would recommend that you try this as well as the other meats. It is, to me, the tastiest.There are also stalls that sell grilled and cooked seafood, which would be more expensive, but worthwhile for those looking for more than basic hawker food.The hawker centre is usually only partially open during the day and most stalls will open for dinner. However, whether you are stopping by for lunch or a cold drink, this is a good resting place to get out of the midday heat. Cold drinks and desserts are a great pick-me-up in between the attractions in the area
4
After spending the afternoon walking around the Gardens by the Bay , we were ready for something to eat. We wanted to watch the Supergrove light show in the evening so didn't want to go far to eat.Decided to visit Satay by the Beach which is well signed in the Gardens. We were there earlier in the evening so not all the stalls were open. I had a satay meal, 15 pieces - 4 chicken, 4 pork, 3 beef, 3 mutton served as kebabs and fish served in banana leaf. All this was served with rice and peanut sauce. This cost 11 dollars and was very enjoyable. Jackie had Fish and beancurd with vegetables and rice costing 13 dollars. When you place an order at the stall they give you a buzzer which goes off when your food is ready. You then go back to the stall to collect your food.We found it a pleasant place to eat and it was popular with other tourist
4
We visited here several times on our Singapore stop-over. It's at the far end of Gardens at the bay almost to the Barrage. It's a good 10 minute walk from Bayfront MRT & the easiest route is to aim for the Cloud Forest & follow the outer path by the water where you'll find runners & cyclists. There is a good selection of stalls & the seating is very pleasant by day & night. The chicken satay was very good, the prawn ones looked better than they tasted. We liked the special friend rice from the Turkish stall as well. It's very good value for money. A feast for $13
5
We found this place whilst wandering through the Gardens on the Bay. It is fantastic. The satays are to die for. Select a table and watch it all unfold. Its a hoot. Lots and lots of different types of food to choice from. Drinks and desserts also. Just fantastic.
4
After visiting Gardens by the Bay, we followed the short path along the water to grab a quick bite of satay, roti, and something sweet. This hawker center is very clean and a bit more expensive than other inner city hawker centers (maybe due to Marina Bay location). Plenty variety of food & is delicious (I don't think there is any bad food in SG; maybe varying portion sizes from place to place)
4
A nice food court located about 500 meters from the entrance to Gardens by the Bay. The different stalls have a good selection of different foods from different countries (including Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese and Singaporean). Went twice, and the evening (Thursday) was pretty hectic with quite a lot of people. The following afternoon (around 5pm) we were some of the only people there. So choose when you go - depending on your temperament, the best time could be either evening or afternoon
4
This is an out door (non-airconditioned, but has large fans) hawker center/food court with quite a variety of food. Although the name is Satay by the Bay, there is also noodle stalls, prata (roti), rojak, a BarBQ stall, rice and other dishes for example; lots of choices. The fruit and drinks stall served both hot and cold drinks - fruit juice and soft drinks for example. The satay was fine, but the peanut sauce was a bit disappointing; we have had better in several places in Malaysia. Since it is by the sea, there are sea breezes and the view is lovely. It is open from morning until night; we went there about 5:30 after spending the afternoon in the Gardens by the Bay.
4
This is a hawker type area but much cleaner, quieter and further away. It took us approx 15m walk from the front entrance, and 7min walk from the visitor centre to get to it.Lots of choice of food. We were looking for halal options so chose 1. Sri geylong sate. Had the basic package foe satay chicken here as starters. Cooked fresh on tbe bbq, served with a lush peanut sauce. Was one of the tastiest satays ive had.2. Makan by the bay. We shared the black pepper chicken from here with vegetable rice (no mushrooms). The chicken had flavour and wasnt too peppery (as ive had at other places) and the rice were not bad either although look a lil watery.Drinks. You go to the drink stall in the middle to choose your drink. Serve hot and cold drinks.The stalls provide cutlery and napkins. You dont need to move your tray from the table once you have finished eating. The overall food was really filling and hit the spot! Would come back to eat here again if we were at the gardens
3
Had a good choice of food available, not just satay. The satay sellers were hassling us as we looked at the stalls – all appear to offer the same satay for the same price. We bought from the stall that didn’t hassle. We were there at dusk on a week night so it wasn’t very busy. It is quite a long walk from the conservatories and back to the MRT
5
It's outside,therefore, it can be hot. The food ,however, was something special we enjoyed every bite, and after walking around the gardens a sit down was surely welcomed. The atmosphere was typical "hawker market" ,a very interesting place for some people watching
4
We were brought here by a local and enjoyed a sample of the dishes on offer from various stalls. All quite tasty. Very convenient to grab a bite before visiting the Gardens. Open or just under cover so can get pretty hot & humid.
4
Went to Satay by the Bay one night for dinner with a bunch of people. Had a blast as we all shared different Satay. We also shared a huge tower of beer. This is outside, hot and can be fun!
2
Satay is supposed to be a local delight and somehow all the staff at citysatay was manage and grill by PRC. How does these people know about local taste and yet they got the cheek to claim they are the best satay. The management of the food court really need to wake up their idea.
3
If you are in Garden By The Bay in the evening and dinner time is near, pls go to Satay By The Bay.Preferred to sit outside near BBQ stalls are. Variety of stalls selling from hot pot,BBQ,halal,Thai,Chinese,western to beer and juices. You will love this place definitely.
3
We stopped here for our dinner due to we were here visiting the Gardens and attracted to the variety of food. There were many hawker stall selling different type of food and cuisine, price was reasonable too. If you are tired and starving after visiting the Garden, this will be a good place
4
Visited on our last night in Singapore after an afternoon of exploring Gardens by he Bay.We enjoyed a huge portion of chicken Satay with delicious Satay sauce! Very cheap and would recommend.We also enjoyed a roti each with a bowl of delicious curry sauce.Excellent spot for a chilled bite to eat when you want a light dinner or to eat a feast. Good location but a bit of a long walk back to any public transport.
4
We were here prior visiting Gardens by the bay. It was late evening. The food was really interesting. Because of that we missed most of the places as they close around 8.00 pm.They are very methodical and an alarm is given when the order is placed it informs us when the order is ready. Therefore it is very convenient
5
We stopped here for a bite to eat prior to going to Gardens By The Bay. There are lots of different stalls selling hawker type food. We had the most amazing satay set for two for AUD$15.00. The food is cooked fresh and the satay sauce was amazing. Would love to go back again
3
We had an evening meal here, relaxed atmosphere, lots of different stalls offering satay and other dishes, but small meat/chicken pieces on the satay sticks. It’s a lovely setting offering an alternative for the tourist market and visitors to Gardens by the Bay who don’t want to eat at McDonald’s or the expensive establishments in the Gardens
4
This is a market style collection of vendors for an easy meal... You just go to each vendor and choose your meal which they then prepare fresh. Apparently well policed by the authorities for cleanliness so feel safe
4
Love the satay sticks and the reasonable prices.
Will definitely return for the tasty food and fun atmosphere.
4
If you like Satay and most importantly if you like meat then this is the place for you to go. Situated in the gardens by the bay complex it’s a foodies delight and since you get your beer as well it’s the perfect sit back and relax experience
3
Do not come hungry, do not come wanting to eat quickly and prepare for queues and more queues - at least on Saturday evening. We got there around sunset and the place was mayhem, every single stall had long queues. Tables were crowded, uncleared and the atmosphere was hectic and a madhouse.You could not even read the menus, as the place was so packed. We queued 35 minutes to buy some fruit and drinks, then another 25 minutes for satay, only to be told the wait for Satay was to be over 1 hour due to the many orders. We were starving and had young exhausted kids in tow. So we looked for a less busy satay stall, queued again and got our buzzer and were told 20 minutes which turned out to be 45 minutes. So every single time, you want any food, you need to queue, order,pay, get a buzzer and then wait however long the wait is which you won't know when you queue up. I wanted to get some plain rice for the kids and was told to queue 'over there'. I did, it took me another 20 min to queue up, only to be told 30 minutes wait for plain rice.The kids were half asleep, in tears, everyone was hungry, the whole experience was a disaster and not fun.The best tactic is to get there in a group and fan out, everyone queues somewhere and buys a dish, you meet up, get a table and wait and chat.This obviously does not work for families with kids, as someone needs to stay and watch them.So this was our worst eating experience in Singapore, not due to the quality of the food or the expensive prices - just that we couldn't get our hands on any food before the kids fell asleep. Shared fruit and 20 satay sticks among 5 people and left hungry and disappointed. This was supposed to be fast and fun, NO
3
This hawkercenter is the most touristic one near gardens at the bay. Lot of sateh options was very good. Pitty only that a lot of stand were shouting every second they sell sateh, what was rather obvious. We tried different stands and all were offering delicious food. It's a must to try a hawkercenter when you visit Singapore.
4
We stopped here for lunch when we were having a day at gardens by the bay. It is worth going to if you are nearby. Please take tissues or wipes with you as we could not find any although they do have sinks for you to wash your hands. The food was good. We tried satay and wonton soup whilst there
1
The only dish of reasonable quality was Satay.The seafood is overcooked, char siew wanton is the worst I have had in Singapore, the vegetables are overcooked and soggy.It is 5 times the cost of a usual food court and horrific quality.Geared only for tourists... Avoid at all cost.Go to Newton Food Centre for an authentic experience with good food or Ion Orchard food hall for great quality food and air con... check out the East Coast Seafood Centre for great seafood
4
If you compare to other food markets like one in the Maxwell road, it is 2 times more expensive. I think the reason is because of the park or touristic attractions around. Also the waiting time was long, around 10min. I ordered vegetarian dishes, but it was fresh cooked and very tasty. If you are thirsty, try the Singaporean cream sodas:-
3
Food: AveragePrice: AverageService: Only if you are a tourist (You get ripped off anyway), else, forget about serviceAtmosphere: Smokey, a little run downDinner for 5. Head down early (Before 5.30pm if you wanna get a seat). Satay is the most common food on every table
5
Took a "Riverside" walk from Clarke Quay Central to Gardens by the Bay and was rewarded with a special treat...a food paradise in itself where choices of grilled and BBQ delicacies are just envious. It's one of those days you would wish you have more than 1 stomach to take them all in : grilled stingray with a glass of cold beer, BBQ chicken wings, traditional Rojak, popiah, ... and of course, satay and ketupat (Malay rice dumpling) dipped in peanut based sauce...heavenly... for those who want to skip the beer, go for the sugar cane drink with lemon...forget the soft drinks
3
Came here after visiting Flower Dome and Cloud Dome. Ordered a set menu of satay and added a plate of veggies. All were fine but nothing extraordinary. Nice atmosphere and very clean.
4
Loved this place and it's location, we went here before heading to the light show at super tree grove. I am a vegan and was able to find something I could eat although it was nothing special.
3
The food court here has a lot of choices. The satay we had was good enough. The roast duck ok. Best thing we ate was the mango sago dessert and a cup of kopi.
4
Best place to get some food in evening before watching the trees light show. Cosy outdoor, all kind of food hawker centre. Just behind the cloud forest, 5 minute walk from the trees and 15 from Marina bay sands.
3
First visit here, satay was disappointing, the rest of other food were average. Tables were cleared & cleaned quite fast with baby chairs available for families though.
2
Maybe it was the time of day (about 3:00 PM) but we had a hell of a time getting food at this place. First off we ordered some satay from one vendor. They were expensive and teeny tiny. We wanted to get some rice to fill up on but we're met with almost hostile attitudes and 3 different vendors telling us that they were closed. This area is also quite far from the main garden area. We will not go back
4
We never usually eat in street or market centres but were suggested this place by a local. It is a typical hawker centre near Gardens by the Bay, lots of locals.Had satay sticks at City satay and it was good. Cheap beer and five mins away from the night show at Gardens by the Bay. Can't beat a night out for $40 in Singapore
4
A good place to eat whilst visiting Gardens by the Bay. We went for dinner and it was really crowded at 6pm. Had to walk around a few times to find a spot to sit and eat. A typical hawkers style eatery, lots of people, lots of noise but plenty of delicious options. Don't get frustrated with the crowds, just enjoy the experience
4
We went there while visiting Gardens by the Bay and tried the byriani masala chicken and the Masai dosa at an Indian stall and really liked it! Everything was really fresh!They're other vendors so you can grab the food you like! We purchased the drinks at the fresh juices spot!Highly recommended if you are visiting gardens by the bay
4
While visiting Gardens by the Bay my husband and I ate at Satay by the Bay. You have several choices of the type of satay that you want to eat - we got a combination so was able to taste all the options. It is prepared while you wait so it is fresh. You are also given several dipping sauces. The food was very good. We bought a local beer from another vendor and the combination of food and drink were great. Would definitely recommend it but realize it not an enclosed restaurant and if you decide you would like something else to eat there are numerous other food vendors in the market area. Casual attire is ideal with comfortable shoes because you will also most likely be visiting Gardens by the Bay. Family oriented site
5
Singapore is very modern and western. maybe only in the Outdoor Food Court you remember to be in Asia. here you can sample satay of all kinds at low prices amongst the locals in a beautiful park behind gardens by the bay.
4
A special birthday dinner for my beloved mummy...
Though some of the menu resemble those of Seoul Garden, pricing is more affordable and fix!
Maximum price stated was at $30 nett (if im not wrong).
3
Maybe my expectations were too high but I was a little disappointed. This was my 5th visit to Singapore but my first to Satay By The Bay. I was expecting really great Malaysian/Satay but found it a bit ordinary. We had a mixed plate of Chicken beef and pork satay and 4 prawn ( at $4 each!) While not terrible the Satay were no better ( maybe worse) than I'd get in Sydney. But the prawns were the biggest disappointment - like most prawns in Singapore they have a strong chlorine taste. Surely there's better Satay in Singapore!
4
We used to love the Satay club at Clarke Quay and were sad to see it go however Satay by the bay is not bad at all. Good range of vendors selling satay and BBQ seafood dishes etc. Good value for money, a great way to finish the afternoon after walking through gardens by the bay
5
Served skewered on a stick, these BBQ meat snacks - beef, chicken and mutton - are perfect for sharing amongst ravenous groups, usually for dinner or supper. Served with chopped onions, ketupat (dense rice cakes), and a thick peanut dipping sauce that's both sweet and nutty, satay is indeed soul food that you can get at most here
3
I personally would not recommend eating at the Satay By The Bay eating area...Overpriced food, quality is ordinary - much better places in Singapore to eat and spend your money.I am not one for eating at classy restaurants and much prefer hawker food, but sadly what we ordered would have to be some of the most disappointing food I have eaten in over 30 years of travelling to Singapore.Always wanted to eat here...Have done...Won't be doing so again 
4
This place is based on the original stay stalls that littered Singapore and has a great atmosphere and a range of little vendors including stay, gelato and a constant source of beer should you want it. We grabbed a $65 large platter which included a huge amount of different stay sticks all cooked fresh and a buzzer to let you know when they were ready. Service staff are around to provide you alcohol if you want it with dinner and a good range of beer, spirits and mixed drinks is on hand. The area buzzes with activity and is well set out with plenty of little tables harking back to the time the foo sellers used small tables and chairs as they were the easiest to grab when they needed to run from the law for hawking foods on the streets.Worth a visit but there is not a steady stream of taxis so either be prepared to take the walk to Marina Bay (about 20 minutes or so) or have Uber on hand
5
We had a great meal after watching the light show at Gardens by the Bay. The food area was busy and vibrant. Plenty of places to sit and eat still. The Satay was amazing and the sea food was great. We had stingray for the first time. Lots of choice of great food and good for first experiences. Highly recommended.
4
For my birthday in Singapore some friends an family decided on going to the Satay Club aka Satay By The Bay. All of us (party of 8) met up at about 7:30 pm and it was incredibly busy as it was a Saturday night. Recommend taking a cab or uber as parking was limited.After navigating the crowd, my god sister ordered a whole bunch of food which included sambal kangkong, crispy fried baby squid, steam cockles, chili crab, lots of satay and sautÃ©ed bok choy. Damn it was all good. Service was a little slow as it was a busy night. I recommend first timers to ask the servers how to eat some of the dishes if you are not sure.After dinner we moved to the desert stall where everyone picked their own desert. I had an iced jelly with lunch longan and canned fruit. It was good but a little too sweet.When dinner lasts 3 hours, you know it was a good time had by all
4
There were so many options satays and other food. The place was very very crowded but we didn't have to wait too long for our food since there was so many options. We opted for chicken satays and a Mediterranean dish with baba ghanoush. Everything was super fresh and tasted amazing. My only complaint is that we had a really hard time finding a place to sit and eat because it was so crowded
3
Tried for the 1st time n definitely won't return.Went for family dinner during National Day Eve.Price moderate , crowded and food disappointing.Especially halal food, satay very very thin n sting ray too.
5
Had a work dinner down here with colleagues, great fun, fantastic satay, good mix of foods from the various stands and a couple of towers of beer, well worth the outdoor eating experience.
5
Great food, great prices, clean and close to gardens by the bay. The signs sent us the long way round but with a map you can use the shortcuts
4
Stopped for some satay after a long afternoon wandering around the gardens. Satay was very good, atmosphere lively. Lots of choice at reasonable prices.
3
Stopped here for a few sticks of satay. Nice tasty satay with a good peanut sauce. Lots of other food available. Good atmosphere.
5
It is located Near the Marina Bay Garden and you can choose from a variety of food available here and not only Satay, they have seafood, Vietnamese and Arabic food there and even a bar that serves alcohol. it was not that cheap but compare to all restaurants near the area it is worth it. We order a Satay package including prawn, pork and Chicken satay and additional oyster omelet and chicken rice
4
This is a more organised hawkers food market where there must be over 30 stalls selling mainly Asian cuisine. Just find a table anywhere and head off to order your food. Some of the places give you a small disc which sounds an alarm when your food is cooked and ready to be collected. In the middle is a stand selling fruits (individual pieces or mixed fruits) as well as drinks. You can get plastic cups with ice in too but it isn't obvious. They have local drinks plus bottles and cans of other soft drinks. One of the most popular foods here is Satay but there is a huge choice. There is a toilet block and you can also get Uber to drop off/pick up from the car park next to it. It is open into the evening
4
A good choice when you are in the Gardens. The food is no better than a local hawker centre, although it costs about 30% more. Fair enough though, SBTB is for tourists and sits by the water with no other competition until back at the marina. HOT LOCAL TIP FOR ALL YOU TOURISTS: Get yourself a couple of popiah. Pronounced pop-ee-ah. They do it really well here. Fresh and refreshing on a hot day. And every day is a hot day
3
Good option of food, you get a taste of street food in an organized food court. Toilets and washing facilities are present but not very clean however does the job. We went to to it after watching the light show at the gardens by the bay.
4
A friend brought me there on my visit to SNG and I really enjoyed the place. The atmosphere was very lively and exotic. It's an open space with various stalls. You look around and choose what to eat and you can assemble your dinner picking dishes from different stalls. Full of people, mainly locals. What I tasted was good quality too.
4
Loved the location of this food stand. The food was good and it was nice to be right next to gardens by the Bay. Clean bathrooms and good service!!
3
Had seafood barbecue, tasty but over cooked. But there is so much more on offer here, it's a shame we weren't able to come back and sample something else.
4
The Satay was absolutly good, we thought much better then on the streets. The prices wasn't that high as expected. It absolutly worth after a walk through the bay.
3
Nothing special except it's by the bay. The hawkers are still what you typically find in the city center: satay, seafood, chicken rice, etc.
Area is clean and with wash basin. It's a good idea to walk after a big meal to burn those calories
5
Great way to finish our visit to gardens by the bay! Plenty of options for cheap prices, and topped of with a bar serving beers for low prices considering the high Singapore prices. Would definitely return!
5
If I didn´t look on the map I would have missed it! A great foodcourt with great Satay but also Chilly Crab!!! Just have a scroll around and try the different meals!

My son and I went here with friends. Excellent food at a good price. Would definitely come again if ever in Singapore.
2
They advertised that they opened at 11:00 so we arrived at that time in order to have lunch before heading into the garden. When we arrived only 2 stalls were open. One was the beverage stall and the other was the Indian stall. My husband and daughter who like Indian food were happy but I wasn't. Indian isn't my thing particularly at 11:00am.
4
In between visiting the Cloud Dome and the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay, we ducked out for some food before the night time show.Satay by the Bay was an easy 5 minute walk along the river and offered a quick, cheap bite to eat. The Chicken satay's we ordered were terrific. The Duck and rice dish was full of splintered bones so a bit hard to eat.Only thing we had difficulty with was finding napkins but apart from that, easy to get a table and the food kept us all going for the rest of the night
5
I don't know how many different eatery's there are but at least 2o or more, I choose the Turkish and had a lovely salad, it really filled the plate, another place sone had Mie Goering which was delicious I was told. Another a hamburger on a Black Bun which at first seemed a little off putting but was soft and fresh and added another dimension to it. I forget the other 2 but all in all 4 places were tried and all were happy, very good price. Lovely cold beer and ciders. Plus a breeze was blowing, only gently but made it very comfortable, the complex is covered by a roof but opposite the ocean
4
Skewers of charred meat. Yum. We located it while walking in the gardens near the Marina Sands. Lots of families enjoying the cafes.
4
We had a lovely time at the Marina Barrage nearby before moving to Satay by the Bay for refreshments. The variety and quality of food was great, as were the drinks. It is an oasis in the city!!
4
After spending 4 weeks in Thailand this place seemed a little pricey, we paid $14 for 20 satays. It might just seem that way as we have been in somewhere cheaper though. The food is tasty and it is right besides Garden By The Way.
4
Surprised to find a hawker centre inside the Garden by the Bay. I tried satay sticks and they are not bad at all. Yum yum.
4
This food court was one of the best I had the chance to visit when in singapore. There is a huge variety of food and the picnic like atmosphere comes as a bonus
5
There was a great choice of food here, but we wanted satay, so we got the selection of meats and prawns and it was all absolutely delicious especially washed down with a cold Tiger beer. We had a selection of fresh fruits for dessert. All very fresh and again all very delicious. We got the shuttle back to the entrance - well worth the ride after a long day of walking and site seeing :
4
Fun place to go if you are in the area. We went to Sir Geylang Sate and it was pretty good. Wish the amount of meat was larger but what do you want to for .55 (USD) per stick? Just order more! This place also had a fresh fruit stall which was great since the night was hot and balmy
4
Come to Satay By The Bay once a month or so. It is hawker center style place near the Marina Barrage and has great views of the Lagoon. You need cash for most or possible all of the stalls.It is covered open air seating, which was welcomed since the last time we visited it was raining very hard. We were looking for an open air space to take the dog out on an excursion but also keep her dry.This visit we tried some chicken wings. The big style wings with both parts of the wing still attached to each other. Very nice crispy skin and delicious. Also had some popiah, an egg prata and my daughter had a chocolate and banana prata. Then of course also some satay, chicken, mutton and prawns. Most excellent and great value for money. We think the best satay stall is Geylang satay.There is a good juice station for thirst quenching and also a bar for a pint
3
A nice variety of food and great location for families and friends. The food that we tried were in the same quality and price as in their shops in other food courts but needed to wait much longer in this place as many people e.g. tourists go there. For example, we chose to have our satay at a stall called "City Satay" and they said the food would take about 20mins. We were happy to wait as we could try other food while they were getting our food ready (as we chose to have satay and rice as our main course). They gave us a buzzer after we paid. However, it did not buzz after some 40 minutes so I went back to check. They said our food would be ready in 15 minutes. After some 15 minutes I went back again to check and they told me to come back in another 10 minutes. At that moment, I noticed many others were standing there with their buzzers waiting and some started to complain they had been waiting for more than an hour. I started to request our food like others and looked like whoever the loudest got their food faster... not a particularly enjoyable experience. Anyway, I got our satay skewers after over 100 minutes (more than 5 times of the original timeframe). Also, we noticed some other got side dishes e.g. cucumbers and onion from them and they didn't offer any to us.
4
If you are at Cloud Forest or Flower Dome worth making the 7 minute walk to Satay by the Bay for food/drinks. It is a clean and safe to eat under cover hawker style centre with Satay at several stalls plus lots of other food/drink choices as well. Satay is a must have dish in Singapore. The centre is close to the water and is a nice environment. Best to avoid peak times as can be crowded as popular place with the locals especially on weekends
4
So much choices spoils for choice. The food and environment is great and relaxing will highly intro to everyone to come and eat and try
5
My partner and I paid $20 for 10 chicken and 10 beef satay! They were amazing!!!! I defo recommend a visit whilst visiting gardens by the bay.
5
We found Satay by the Bay at the end of our stay, i wish we found it sooner! Delicious satay that is well priced and also has alcohol at good prices. Lots of locals and tourists and lots of food options to choose from.
4
If you love the food and drink, this place must be visited. Nice taste of Satay and relax environment.
But prepare with the comfortable shoe which need to walk from garden by the bay is just a bit far.
5
Very reasonable and authentic place to visit. All freshly cooked for you with ample seating areas. Lots of different stalls to choose from. Chicken skewers and freshly cooked prawns were delicious
4
My husband and I really only ate here because we wanted to get some food before the Supertree light show at night. We were pleasantly surprised by the variety of options, the reasonable prices, and good food. It's not the best food that I ate in Singapore, but, for wanting to see the show, and not get too far out of the Gardens, it's a pretty perfect spot. Worth mentioning that it's cash only at most places, so make sure you have enough
4
Difficult to review as there is a large selection of food types here however over several visits we got through a few of the stands wares. it was all good and some of it was excellent. I really enjoyed the Mediterreanean stand while my wife absolutely loved the seafood noodles. Decent selection of beers and dessert options too. perfect place to eat while watching the turtles and fish in the nearby pond
1
Don't be taken by the nice pink shirts and the full grill of satay sticks because it takes a long long long time to get your food 45 minutes for some satay sticks and cubes of cold rice that get popped out of plastic.Hungry kids had I known the wait was so long I would not have ordered. After ordering thinking it was immediate they said 20 minutes which was really 45.I could even hear them lying to people saying 15 minutes knowing and seeing dockets on the docket rail piled up Food average, satay sauce nice, experience below average
5
Still one of those food courts mostly attended by tourists that have just gone to watch the Light show or otherwise circling the Gardens. However, the food is SO GOOD!While the place is called 'Satay by the Bay" you'll find a ridiculous amount of seafood restaurants. I can only recommend those! A total must dish while in Singapore is the Chili Crab and the Cuttlefish with morning glory. Its fantastic to watch how they prepare it and tastes even better
5
Who doesn't want to sit outside, eating BBQ'd seafood, chicken, beef (and just about anything else!!), or delicious satay, with the smell of burning charcoals wafting through the air, while enjoying ice cold beer in a balmy, waterfront setting?Sounds too good to be true, but it's all there at Satay on the Bay. And only a 10 minute walk to the Marina Bay Super Trees, it's a must visit while in Singapore!
4
After a long walk finally we find this satay by the bay. There are some sate kiosk there and we choose one which offer mixed satay. Its contain chicken, prawn, beef and lamb. Satay is good!
There are many food instead of satay too
4
Nice cheap satay in a hygienic setting in the gardens by the bay. Satay and sauce delicious and cooked to order while you wait. Draft Tiger on offer as well from the beer stall.
4
Good variety of food for a fair price. Can be a bit tricky to find a spot to sit down. The surroundings are nice, so before and after dinner you can have a nice stroll around the gardens.
5
I simply love this place. It served verity type of food from western to local. Very nice satay and grill prawn with reasonable price.
3
Nice foods but too expensive , good thing is that is located in Garden by the bay .
Went there for cycling and its easy to drop by here for a drink and some satays .
4
This has been my 5th visit to Satay by the Bay within one calendar year.For the foreign travelers who are coming to Singapore, Satay by the Bay is a venue where there is a collection of stalls selling "SATAY" as the signature dish here.It is very rare to find a congregation of so many different satay stalls in Singapore localed within the same place."Satay" is a dish of marinated meats (Chicken, Beef, Mutton) skewered with small sticks, cooked over charcoal fire and eaten with a sweet/slightly spicy gravy sauce made from peanuts and other ingredients.The stalls at Satay By The Bay can be divided into two segments: Muslim stalls/Chinese stalls.For foreign friends who have not tried this dish before and are keen to try, I will recommend for you all to order BEEF and MUTTON from the Muslim stalls, and then Chicken Satay from the Chinese.After trying most of the stalls here, I find that the Muslim stalls general have better marinated BEEF/MUTTON satay.Do not be misled into thinking that the stall(s) with the longest queue tastes the best. You can actually try the other stalls that do not have a long queue and the taste does not differ very significantly.The likely difference can lie in the peanut-gravy sauce.The price has been standardized to cost about $7.00 for 10 sticks.Strongly recommend for visitors to walk from Marina Bay Sands Hotel (about 15 minutes stroll), as the parking of vehicles can be a bit difficult at peak hours after 6pm on weekdays
4
Close to the Garden by the Bay this venue isan ideal place to eat before visiting the gardens at night as it is just a 10 minute walk alongside the barrage lake to the gardens. The satays are great and there are selections of other local food available. The prices are good with satays costing 70c each. I had some crab fried race that was delicious.Choices of drinks including beers and fresh fruit juices are available. Everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed the food
5
It's a bit of a walk from marina bay sands about 15 to 20 minutes depends on how fast you walk but really worth it.You will pass along the Gardens by the Bay so you will also enjoy the view of plants while heading there.The food are really good specially if you want to experience local.There's a lot of seafood choices and really great satay or bbq.The price is not cheap but not so expenssive either.Only 2 stores accept CARD, one is the Bar area and one food place.SO BRING SINGAPORE CASH to avoid in convenience.There's an ATM on the way to the Satay by the Bay by the Garden Area as well it's one kilometer away.The place is always pack so you have to find a table for yourself especially it's self service.Over all this is a great place to dine to experience local food in Singapore.
4
If you want to sample some of the more simple culture that Singapore has to offer then this is must. There are countless places to eat offering all types of local cuisine. Too much to choose from really. Probably the cheapest meal I had during my stay in Singapore
4
Come to satay by the bay quite often, normally by bike. It is on the track in between Marina Bay and the Marina Barrage and so quite convenient as a stop off point.There are several satay stalls we normally go to Sri Geylang satay and get mutton, chicken and rice cakes.We have also tried rojak, Prata, chicken wings, BBQ seafood and other typical hawker items. There's also a good juice shop.There's a open air bar towards the back of the dining area with better seating and freshly pulled drafts.It has some great views of the city and being on the water has a peaceful feel to it. The place is clean and well kept. If you are visiting Singapore and want to try a hawker center for some satay this could be a good choice.Bring cash mostly cards are not taken
3
There are lots of food stalls available. Two of which are serving good satay. It is best to go during dinner before you watch the light show at the garden.
5
Satay was fantastic... best we had in Singapore. Lots of food options and very reasonable. Great pit stop while going round the gardens.
4
We had quite a number of food tasted, good to sit around the satay stalls with small stools and low table, just like the olden days.
4
We wandered here to sample satay for the first time in 46 years - it didn't disappointment.A lovely little hawker market away from the stunning Gardens on the Bay,Marina Sands etc - peaceful,reasonably priced little food market.
5
We were there in a group of 20. Had A variety of muslim food. Everything was delicious including the famous satay. The place gets crowded after 6.30pm. A good walk along the bay after dinner ended the trip for us.
2
I have always wanted to try the satay here. This brings back memories as those days the satay club was a popular weekend spot for families and couples. Besides being at an iconic location and overlooking the sea, the satay was just average and peanut sauce was loaded with sugar. I have tasted better satay from any hawker centre with a better price tag.
5
View on the water, great seafood you can find normal cheap Hawker food but also restaurant level Chili crab, pepper crab, also amazing satay and steam boats. Lots of room as the area is quite big.Easy to get parking, walking distance to the MBS hotel , the two domes! Kids water area and more. So much to see in that area. Perfect place to eat relax before or after exploring beauties of Gardens by the Bay. My favorite!!Bon AppÃ©tit
5
Four of us are here before heading into the Gardens for the evening light show.We ordered up a feast of dishes, all of which were really good, but the chilli crab was stunning. Meaty, tasty and the sauce it was swimming in was amazing (buy a plate of small buns for $3 to help soak up that sauce!). Satay was good (pork belly the best) and again the sauce was really, really good. All reasonably priced (I think all up with a mountain of food, inc 2 decent sized crabs it worked out to $65 per head) and the four of us shared a beer tower (4 liters), which was $68 in happy hour! If you're wanting a good feed before the show, would recommend this as an option. Place itself is a bit tired and basic, but you're there for the food and that crab was amazing
3
We have decided to go to Satay by the bay after our walk around at the art box Singapore near MBS. The place is crowded, there are great varieties of food and prices are cheap as it is hawker food. We have ordered stingray, lala, fried vegetable, rojak, satay, chicken wings and pineapple fried rice. The only tasty food is the chicken wings and there is a long queue for it. The rojak is very sweet and saltish, other food taste normal. For Singaporean, there are better hawker center out there that served better food and cost slightly cheaper. For tourist wise, it is good to visit there after the walk in garden by the bay and it cost slightly cheaper than lau pat sar
2
Busted the cleaning staff with a large bundle of used forks and spoons rinsing them in the hand basin @ the ladies loo. No hot water, no soap. Hand picking out the food scraps. Straight back into the cutlery dispensers. Gross. Spoke to them but no effect. Use the chop sticks!!!
5
Great place, great food, drinks and all for very reasonable prices!
You will definitely enjoy your time here!
4
Great place to stop by for a meal before the light show begins at Garden by the Bay. They not only sell satays but do have other food as well. It can however get quite smoky.
4
This place is dedicated to small shops selling local food, which is great. Not cheap, but with service it offers it is reasonable. I see myself coming back there some day.
4
Very good for cillout. Not too crouded and english orderable halker center.. will come back again :)
2
Location is amazing! Food court itself is ok, but selection is average and prices too high for the food quality. But worst thing are the toilet. Very dirty, not well maintained. They really need to change something here as it gives a bad impression on Singapore. Ok to go there if you are visiting the gardens but don't go to this food court just for a nice lunch or dinner
1
Everything was fine till my daughter discovered a caterpillar / bug in her dish - a refund was offered but the cook just shrugged. Apparently it wasn't a surprise to him. Gave me a look - so what if you're a vegetarian! Never again! Hubby said what did I expect from a hawkers stand! At $15 a plate I expect cleanliness!!!! Is that too much to ask in Singapore?
3
I happened to be in that area for some photo shoot and bump into it. The place is not crowded if you are early, say about 1900h. The table cleaners would have sufficient time to clear the tables. The crowd started to stream in around 1915h - 1930h and the diners would need to DIY to clear the tables. The crowd just overwhelmed the limited number of table cleaners.Food wise is just another up market hawker food venue. Try the food's taste as the price is 1.5X the usual hawker center food elsewhere. This place is just another sibling of the high stall overheads outdoor dining area and the other 3 are Lau Pa Sat, Newton Circus and Gluttons by the Ba
3
I think it is better here than the food shops and restaurants close to the Domes. The place got a good variety of local dishes at very reasonable price. We picked Singapore as our holiday destination because of the food and we are interested in local food so this place fits our criteria. I had the grilled chicken and rice which I finished off with a tasty Chendol. Even better we got buy one and get one free Chendol for 2.80 Singapore dollar. It is only a short walk about 5 minutes from the domes
4
Not much to say here. It's a bit far to walk to as you have to walk through gardens by the bay.But the food is good, it's a nice vibe and the beer is about 10 SGD per pint of draft if i recall.Would go again
5
I have been back here on each trip to Singapore. A bite of a walk through Gardens by the Bay but worth it,Sate's are freshly cooked we had chicken and crispy pork both good and plenty of sauce. The other stalls all looked clean with the usual pictures so you can see what you are ordering. The carrot cake which is a savoury dish famous in Singapore was also good.You can grab a table and leave a packet of tissues on the table to reserve your table while you look around and choose, an accepted practice at hawker stalls. Beers and ciders are a good price for Singapore and nice and col
4
Walked over the bridge from Marina Bay Sands to here. Takes about 15 minutes to stroll there. Several satay stalls and Tiger beer waitresses. Have Roti Prata with your satay. Sit near Bay end for best view.
3
We only had some snacks here during tea time. Of course higher prices and less value but you're paying for the location (again) and the view. Food is good (we only had satay) but you can get better downtown for sure.
4
want an inexpensive local meal al fresco? hawker...in particular? but dont want to fight with the crowds, and not be in a sauna-like environment? oh...and you wanna have a great nite out, eating in a garden-like setting, yea? then head onto Satay by the Bay, which is collection of hawker stalls (clean setting) plonked smack into the Gardens by the Bay locale (other pricier food shops exist too). getting there is easy-peasy : cab'll get you there off course...but, youd've missed out on a phenomenal walk within the gardens and the shoreline of the reservoir (chance to see a family of otters enroute). Take the Downtown Line getting off at Bayfront > tip : go there around 6.45-ish...and catch the sunset, as you meander towards Satay by the Bay. its about 10-12mins from exit B; well sign-posted. when there, satay is a definite must try; a bar offers you the variety of beers & drinks, and the rest is basically a choice of chinese stir-fry, indian-muslim eats, seafood BBQ, usual western items (fish-n-chips, porkchops, etc)... and if none of this grabs you, then try the turkish! yup...simply put, its gastronomia and you're spoilt for choice, becoz essentially all these are mini-restaurants vying for your custom. place your order(s)...and find a nice table under a fan & next to the garden-pond area... oh, note your table number and tell them as such... because, as you chow down the grub and look outwards to the garden & water feature, you'll get lucky and spot a variety of birds themselves having dinner (as night falls). its great for family...and even bringing visitors to showcase a different side of singapore. this is worth a 3-thumbs' up badge
2
In a nutshell: if I didn't have to come here again, it would not be a loss in my life ...We came here on a Saturday evening and it was crowded - surprisingly, a large proportion were locals! This was surprising only because the food here is a poor imitation of what a half-decent hawker centre would serve. Clearly, prices are going to be higher at a place like this.What we ate:- 15 sticks of satay at $10, plus $1 for one ketupat (rice cake) from City Satay- 4 barbecued chicken wings at $1.50 each - total $6- 3 large sugar cane at $3 each - total $9 I they have regular at $2 but the lady didn't give me this choice. I only realised this too late after I had paid - sneaky on her part no?- small Yang Zhou fried rice ($7) and small plate of stir-fried baby kailan ($9) Boon Tat Barbecue- small porridge ($2) and braised claypot frog leg with dried chili ($18) from Marina Live SeafoodThe best of the lot was probably the satay and that was mainly because I drenched each stick of chicken satay in peanut sauce! My daughters had the fried rice which I think I could have done better! And most disappointing of all was the frog-leg because it was expensive and poorly executed - there was hardly any taste of the chili and the gravy was very watery instead of being thick.I also felt ripped off by the sugar cane! HIghly unlikely that we will be back unless we have visitors from overseas who specifically ask us to take them to this place
5
We were staying the the Sands hotel and decided to walk over for dinner. We ended up ordering a bit of everything and the food was great. I particularly enjoyed the Kerang, which are tiny clams that taste like raw oysters. They were very fresh and very good
5
I am glad I have bought my satay from Sri Geylang Sate. The satay meat and peanut sauce is just right for my taste bud and met my expectation. I dare to say that the sate is among the best that I have ever eaten... I am even thinking about it as I am typing this review.Went there during lunch. Thus, I was not able to try out their prawn satay and bbq chicken wing as its only available in the evening
4
This is an upscale Hawker's Centre with everything from quite literally buckets of seafood to pizza and of course all the Chinese and Indian favorites in between. They also have some traditional satay stalls hence the name. Try the bellypork satays - the are wonderful! Near the bathrooms there is a bar and it's what we call the 'comfy corner' - it has much better tables & chairs
5
After a long day at gardens by the bay we had dinner here. Very good food court and for us it was evan better with so many halal options. Tried the satay from two stalls both were brilliant. The sister's stall was much better. They also met our special request gladly and did a wonderful job with our prawns. We were so happy the following night we took our guests there again this time the sisters done a marvellous job to keep us all happily fed. Plenty other options. Good salads, breads and very nice juices. Very beautiful setting and nice facilities.
3
If you're visiting Gardens by the Bay and looking for some local food options, this tourist-friendly hawker centre is within walking distance. Unlike the suburban versions, this venue has more spacious seating and contemporary design with landscape surrounds. Prices are also much higher for this sanitized product. The atmosphere was fairly quiet around dinner time. There were no queues for the satays. There were several stalls to choose but we finally settled on a set of chicken, mutton, beef and tripe satay with honey BBQ chicken wings from Sri Gelang Satay. The satays and chicken wings looked attractive but the satays were skinny slivers of meat on sticks. They were tasty but the textural profile was not the salivating burnt and juicy from other stalls in suburban hawker centres. Still it was an enjoyable night hunkering over grilled food with friends and lonely hawkers in the background.Although the attraction is satay, there are many other food options that showcase the local Singaporean hawker fare like noodles, radish cake, rojak, grilled seafood and chicken wings. There's even live music now on every Thursday from 8pm to 10pm
3
Walking through the Gardens By The Bay towards the Marina Barrage, and you'll see people making their strolls and workouts along the pavement. A comfortable place to relax, until you see Satay By The Bay, a good place for a stop by when you're starving from the workouts. Food wise, it's hawker centre food selling at double / triple the price you can get at any other hawker centres in Singapore. And, I am sure you can find better and more worth the money food in the hawker centres. If you can hold your hunger, travel to neighbouring places with much better food that will satisfying and leave your tummy craving for more
4
This places provides a good selection of Asian food at a very reasonable price. Very informal dining. Would recommend for a quick meal.
4
We went to satay by the bay and were pleasantly surprised. BBQ prawns, chicken duck , all served with a delicious satay sauce .
2
With the amount spent there, you can get much better tasting food in Maxwell/ Newton Circle. It was crowded and the food wasn't as expected. Overrated place!
4
Great value for food at a major tourist attraction.
We enjoyed a $20 selection of satays and shared it between two of us so it was excellent value.
5
The best food I had today !We did do the satay combo with 20 satay, 10 chicken legs and 10 chicken wings, 5 big shrimps and 2 rice cakes for 35 SdollarThere are many many many other things you can eat like steamboat, thai, malay etc etc....Very good prices
3
An average tasting satay options. Do not go there with high expectations. Though Charcoal grilled satay is the main highlight of this place, stalls also have an extensive menu for asian style food items. There are numerous stalls trying to sell their best satay to you so as you walk around just go by the gut feeling and won't be disappointed (literally next morning i infer). On the other hand, Marina Bay Sands shopping centre has plenty of quality food items available in their food court which is also open till late night. So if you are in for the light show at Gardens by the bay, then my recommendation is to dine at Marina Bay Sands shopping centre food court which is within walking distance
3
After a wonderful visit to the whole area of the gardens we thought we would complete well with a lunch in this space. And we were right. No luxuries, stone tables, plastic chairs. We ate a set menu, satay of various meats, shrimp and glutinous rice. The shrimp was nothing special but the meat satay and especially the sauce were very tasty. Very good price
5
Loves the variety foods that was served, the satay, the rojak, the wholly crab are all so tasty and nice. A very nice place for a stroll nearby after dinner with the MBS background. The night lights and the wind blowing makes you wanna chill out there often. Come on down to have your own experience
3
I would say the satay is not exceeding to my expectation. Maybe because I am from Malaysia we have loads of satay stalls everywhere. Here Satay by the Bay are just purely for tourist who just want to have a feel of eating satay. There are more places in Singapore to eat Satay, here is not to tasty
4
Wide selection of meat, fish, seafood or verggie dishes from different vendors. You place your order with one of the vendors, get a buzzer, get your drink from the beverage vendor and by the time you sit down your buzzer vibrates and you can pick up your food
4
A buzzing area with lots of eateries. I had a bit of a wait for my chicken and mutton skewers and but worth the wait they were delicious. The prawn ones weren't as good as the ones I had a lau pau sat
4
Informal but very good affordable food-- lots of variety for everyone in the family-- very enjoyable!
4
There is a lot of choice in satay here and it tastes great! I choose chicken beef and mutton and they all were top quality. Pnly the seating might pose a problem during peak hours.
3
To meet up on a casual afternoon, the place is great with kids: playground and waterplay area nearby
Surrounding is safe and satays are great and fairly priced for a touristic place
Enjoy!
4
由Garden by the bay前往需時15分鐘腳程。食物味美價廉，我特別建議City Satay，真係好好味！Briyani的Mutton Prata實在令人回味無窮! 燒雞翼，Soursop，美祿恐龍都很好味。雖然是露天食市沒有冷氣，但依然值得推薦！
4
A variety of stalls offering cheap eats, and I was rapt to discover my favourite drink a Desperado which I last discovered in France. It is beer and tequila. Very competitively priced compared with other alcohol on offer and it made by day!
4
This sort of hawker centra is a good place to visit for a drink or meal if you are visiting the Gardens, it always seems very quiet when I have visited, I think a lot of people bypass it or do not realise it exists. This is a shame as the food is good and it is surrounded by lush vegetation and ponds, which have abundant bird life which is a bonus, also you may sight the sea otters! We did and saw a family of seven of these incredible animals
2
This should be a premier attraction with good food, a great view and provide the tourist with an authentic experience of what hawker food tastes like. Instead we have mainland chinese hawkers who cant even say satay (they say shar tie) harrassing visitors with their solicitation and poor excuses for local food like carrot cake made with cheese and bacon! I don't mind paying for good food but this place is expensive and lousy - and i am ashamed that that is what alot of tourists would think Singapore hawker food is all abou
4
I lunched here with my children (7 and 10 years) and a family of four with similarly aged kids. It's a hawker style centre with a nice fruit juice counter, many satay stalls and many other food options. The satay was juicy and delicious and served fairly quickly. It is a short walk from The Children's Playground at Gardens by the Bay so a great place to go after a splash at the waterplay area
4
Satay by the Bay is a good location for a meal if visiting the Gardens by the Bay and/or the Marina Barrage. Serving hawker food at reasonable prices, so don't expect 5-star dining experience and quality. Our Japanese visitor was quite happy with the food we ordered... popiah, rojak, chicken wings and chendol... a little of everything so that she got to try a variety of Singaporean food.
5
Hawkers style (street food) area by the gardens. Excellent BBQ wings ... Tasty and inexpensive meal. The food area has options for everyone ... Seafood, satay, vegetarian, fruit, ice cream, and drinks! Worth the stroll after the gardens!
3
A massive choice of food but quite pricey.
Food was ok but nothing special.
The setting was a bit crummy
4
After reading the reviews chose to go there for a cheap meal. Gotta say total disappointment. Chose a selection of Satay, no real flavor, couldn't tell which one was which and really greasy, plus I ordered the sauce recommended on the board and the server got annoyed. I'm sure there's better local food around
5
Satay By The Bay is one of the famous food in Singapore. There are many different kinds of food stall there. I like the grilled prawns there. The prawns is big, fresh and the price are reasonable. Many people go there. Sometimes it is full and need to wait the table
5
Great choice of local dishes. It's like a market place and you can choose dishes from different traders and sit together to eat. Some fantastic satay and crab and other stalls doing dessert and drinks. A bit out of town. Good to visit from the cloud forest, gardens are
5
Tasted the different types of satay on offer such as beef, chicken, mutton and prawns. But what was absolutely divine was the sauce that came with the food. The peanut sauce also had the added ingredient of a spice which turned this dish from what could have been being good to something that was simply mouthwateringly delicious. I could stop there but I won't. I also ordered from another outlet fried egg rice. Unbelievable. My tastebuds were working overtime. Probably the best fried egg rice I have had in such a very long time. I will certainly be going back soon
5
Like most open air eating places in Singapore this was delicious. After you've eaten all the local delights - satays, noodles, oyster omelet & marinated chicken, take stroll along the flyover bridge. The walk & scenery at sunset was just beautiful. Just what you need after eating so much yummy food
4
Although "out of the way" given it's location this place is always busy & buzzing with the different sights, sounds and smells of a typical Singaporean hawker market. Be warned tho it can be very difficult to get a table (especially if there is a group of you) and many stalls will have set tables so be prepared to either wait , find a table then order or squat with strangers. You can get all the traditional foods satay, fried carrot cake, chili crab to noodles, fries and lots in between. The "best" stalls will have (long) queues at them (locals will happily queue when something is that good) - also be aware 30 sticks of satay doesn't last long (Yum).Probably one of the cheapest places we've eaten whilst being here!
5
We went with friends and brought along 4 toddlers. The satay (go to satay opah) is very tasty. We also try the bbq stingray, chilli crab, fish cake, seafood omellete, char keow tieu (is this correct?)... I mean all of singaporean traditional food is here! No need to go to chinatown! And the plus, kids can go play in the park while you eat, enjoy the bay view and fresh air! The price is reasonable by singaporean price. The toilets and hand wash station is clean! Again nothing to compare with china town. The only drawback is how to get there. We are using our friends car, so we can easily park and walk. But, if you are using bus or MRT, well expect some quite far walk to arrive here.
3
This is a bit of an down market group of vendors in the gardens. We stumbled across them while walking. There are only fans here so if it's hot - it's hot. Food it OK and they are probably charging as much as they can get away with. Not overpriced, but only just. If you are here, you may as well eat, but I would not travel here to eat when there are so many other fantastic spots
3
Nice location but food the worst I taste in Singapore compared to all other food courts..
Bought in different corners and they all bad including satay..
Not recommended ..
4
Cheap food for the area which was nice if you are just visiting. Not one of the best hawker centres in the area but still tasty!
5
The Halal Steamboat awsome for the kids. Enjoyed & Not bad for the adults. Seafood, Tomyam & etc..
Satay & Chicken Bbq Wing ... Our Fav...
Awsome Nite.. Tummy filled not only wit food but happiness & love from my family.
4
Affordable eating place with hawker style at garden by the bay. Various choices of local food. We had to wait quite a while for the satay.
4
Great collection of hawker stalls, serving all sorts of Asian specialties at extremely reasonable for the otherwise very expensive Singapore prices.Don't come early, though, as many stalls only start setting up at around midday. If you want to experience the full variety, afternoons and evenings are the best time to visit. Located at the Gardens By The Bay, this is the best place for a quick snack, or a full meal, when visiting the Gardens
3
We only came here as our taxi driver recommended it. We came after our long day of walking around the gardens so it was nice to sit and have a drink but I would skip out and eat somewhere else. The place is designed like a food court with many different places to choose to get your food from. The food we chose was average. The worst thing was that we ordered 6 different meals to share amongst 5 of us and they all came out at different times leaving the first ones cold by the time they all came out. The "famous" chili crab was over priced so we didn't order it. And the satay... Average! Staff were also very rude and basically chucked our dishes at us. We did have some really nice fried rice though! Otherwise might be a nice place for a quick bite but not if your looking for a really yummy meal.
4
We spent 10 hrs at Gardens by the Bay so Satay by the Bay was a great location for both lunch and dinner. For $20 each, we were able to feed a family of 5 with a variety of satay meats, with a very tasty satay sauce! Yes, no airs and graces of a restaurant experience, but great, cheap, tasty food all the same
2
This is a busy place and not somewhere I'd revisit. As a resident of Singapore this venue is a tourist attraction and serves a purpose for those that visit the trees, which is the only time I visit. It's busy, bustling and not my favourite hawker centre in Singapore. Seating is a challenge and the cost is noticable higher then normal hawker centres. Having said that, the selections I've tried are ok.It us quite a walk to access and directions are obscure, to say the least
2
If you like what the locals eat you have found a place to please you. Lacks comfort and fineness - no air conditioning, just basic seats around a table. Communal atmosphere but not so many diners.If fine dining is more your style give this a wide birth. Went after a visit to Marina Barrage for late lunch. Many stalls closed and food looked generally unappetising - the sort you see locals eating on HDB estates. Higher prices than HDB of course!Not to my liking - had a drink and carried on looking for lunch...
4
This place is pretty good but it gets crowded in weekends during meal times and it's hard to get a place to sit. A number of satay stalls serve the same stuff but the taste is very different, my suggestion is not to buy from just one stall. There are other stalls serving local delights but without trying them out, can't comment much on flavour or taste. Overall it's a good visit
5
We came here with friends. Loads of choice of food from all the stalls I had amazing turkish food and everyone said the food was great. Love it here and will be back!!
4
Had steamboat at Satay By The Bay.Those steamboat lovers should dine in there as the price was relatively reasonable with variety food options! Come early on the weekends to avoid dissapointments.
4
Had early evening dinner, love the smell of satay grilling over charcoal. Food was great, satay was awesome, a must if visiting Singapore and you can walk through the Marina Bay gardens as well on the way.
5
Well worth the fairly long, hot walk to find. Excellent freshly made satay in a variety of flavours and at a good price.
5
Everytime i visit gardens by the bay. We have dinner at Satay by the bay. Walk. I dont know any other way to get there but through gardens by the bay. You only have to follow the signs at the gardens. Its quite far especially when you have already spent a day walking around the gardens. We go there at night.Food. Its hawker style & more. Of course there are satays =) you can have a good night cap there a cold beer or an iced kachang or any of the wide array of food & drink choices offeredPrice. My cousin who is based in Sg said its a bit pricier there than the other hawkers in SG probably since its near a tourist spot and additional variety offered. The price difference is not that much it cheaper and has more variety than the one in the garden
3
There are a few shops here selling all kinds of food. I went to the halal steamboat & grill buffet for only $25/pax on weekdays. The place is convenient if you drive but definitely not convenient if you take the train. I dropped off at Bayfront station and walked all the way to here. I felt like I just completed a marathon of sorts, it was really a long way walk. I would come here by car but never by public transport anymore as it's too far for me
3
After watching the light show at Gardens by the Bay we decided to eat at Satay by the Bay. The best way to get there is to walk along the riverside path from the Flower/Cloud Forest domes. The first thing you smell is the satays cooking over the open fires from the stalls at the entrance to the open dining/seating area. Apart from the satay stalls there are a range of other food and drink stalls to choose from. Whilst cleaner than some of the hawker markets it lacks the same raw authenticity. The prices are slightly higher than other markets as well. It's a good family option if you're at Gardens by the Bay but if you have the choice I'd suggest that you go to one of the other hawker markets
4
Ate hear early afternoon after spending time at the gardens on the bay. It is quite a walk to get here but well worth it. Some of the best Hawker/street food we have eaten. Plenty of stalls to choose from with a wide range of choices. We had Satay from a stall by the water and spring rolls from a stall inside. With a beer from a third stall. All delicious and very cheaply priced. Excellen
3
Food was a bit over priced for a hawker stall, certain shops took too long to cook the dishes and mess up orders. Tables were not cleaned properly, we had to wipe down the tables ourselves and the man did not return to wipe the table after removing plates from previous customers, we even had to help him stack the plates as he was taking his time while we stood and waited
3
Located within the Gardens by the Bay area, we made the mistake by following the signs which took us quite a while to find it. There is a much easier way if you walk along the promenade. A large pavilion offers a variety of Asian hawker fare. A number of satay stalls are located outside. The satay there is reasonably good, prices are fair. Go early in the evening as it gets extremely crowded therefore nearly impossible to find seating
4
The satays there was good. I went there with my husband after Garden by the bay show. A little distance walk but worse to eat.
4
We went in the afternoon.Most of the stalls were closed esp the halal stalls or just starting to open so the food was not ready.. the place we ate was a thai food place and food arrived piping hot and delicious.
3
Went for dinner with my daughters.Ordered 30 sticks of Chicken satay & some otah from City satay. My daughters loved the tender chicken and rate it 1 of he best in SG. I like the satay a little more burnt and also think that the peanut sauce is too oily. 4*My girls enjoyed the Hawaiian pizza but i think it is made of frozen pizza. 3*Ordered rojak and popiah from stall 18.Popiah taste good. However it was not cut properly and was served with the skin torn. I had to eat with spoon as the filling spilled when I tried with chopsticks. 3*Rojak - the worst I have had. It is salty and the sugar was not mixed well such that I can still bite sugar cube when I was eating. Rojak is one of my favourite food but this one was so bad threat I did not finished it. 1* - avoid at all cost!Ice kacang - not worth trying and not value for money. 2*I Guess that's why it's called 'Satay by the Bay'...
5
When I hear "food court," I think American mall food. This is nothing like that. Food courts in Singapore are phenomenal and this one tops them all. You can choose between many different types of food - Korean, barbeque, turkish, soups, satay, Thai, etc. It's a great place and it's very clean. It's towards the back of the Gardens by the Bay so an extra is that you take about a 10 min. walk through the Gardens to get there. Make sure and try Satay. It's delicious and is one of the national foods of Singapore
4
The satay there is good. There are also a number of satay stalls to choose from and varities of stalls as well. Do take note not to go so late despite they putting 24hrs but not many stores will be opened by 10pm. Even on a friday night, normal food stalls were mostly closed already.
4
There is a decent variety of food to be had and a fairly vibrant place in the evening. The satay was ok but not amazing and the peanut sauce was bland though we can't remember the name of the stall but it did seem to have a decent turnover of people visiting. Some stalls had buzzers to let you know when food was ready, others relied on receipts and telling you approx how long it would take and a few just relied on honesty! The prices were fair for the food you were getting, as everywhere in Singapore the alcohol was expensive compared to prices in the UK. Quick walk away from the Super Trees and well signposted.
1
The satay at Wu Ker Shu were ordinary, in fact bordering disappointing, considering the hype created by Food Wars program. We could not taste the marinade and the pork and chicken sticks were hard and chewy. Only the pork belly and prawns tasted passable, cannot say much about the satay sauce either. We will try the other satay stalls the next time
4
Open air food court with plenty to choose from but mainly; satay! Choose packages of chicken, beef, mutton satay and plenty of local drinks. Located in the middle of the Gardens by the Bay area, so after eating so much, you can easily walk the 'excess' off around a nice stroll
3
One of the great things about Singapore is the fact you can still go to food markets, like Satay on the Bay and enjoy a range of local foods at a pretty inexpensive rate.Satay on the Bay is one of those and, whilst it may not be everyone's cup of tea (especially those who like refined dining), it is a great alternative to give you the opportunity to taste some really different and fantastic foods.The satay sticks (as you would expect) are great, as is the chili stingray and oyster omelette. There are literally too many choices to mention and the range of small vendor cooks cater to most tastes, including vegetarians.Definitely something that should be on the agenda if you like trying something different and like to save a few bucks in the process. Good to try after a visit to the world famous Botanic gardens of Singapor
5
Although this is not the best option to try local cuisine, it's decent enough after you have spent an evening by the Gardens. A small walk along the bay...the place has several eateries presenting several options. If you arrive really late in the day, chances are that the shops would have run out of food but still a great option in that area to grab some delights
5
If you are looking for an inexpensive and tasty eating experience, then this is the place for you. A little bit of a walk but worth it. Great variety, great taste, good quality - great experience overall.
4
We only had the beef and chicken satays. Next time I will order the shrimp. Somehow they were not on my radar when I ordered.
Do ask for a double order of peanut sauce. There can never be enough.
4
Lovely satay right behind the Flower Domes & Marina Bay Sands, also popular with the locals. It's an outdoor food-court, very casual, lots of non-satay alternatives are available, too. Such as freshly squeezed juices, rice & noodle dishes, fruits & desserts, etc.
4
Outside food court with authentic dishes offering seafood, BBQ, Sarah's, and some international food. Lively and busy and can be a bit confusing. Food was freashly cooked, tasty and fairly priced. You rub shoulders with locals from all ethnic components of the Singapore population. Would definitely eat here again
1
We walked down to this area mid morning on a Sunday, after walking around the Gardens by the Bay; what a disapointment!We checked several times that it was the correct place, especially having read other reviews, can only assume that it gets better later in the day, but with flights later that day could notwait to see.Worse cup of tea and coffee for years, made with condensed milk, and terrible savoury bread something????, language a major issue (our fault for not speaking mandarin but thought this was a major tourist atrraction and we managed atHawker centres).Most venues wre closed so don't come in the morning expecting a choice
5
The name says it all. If you want satay (and they love it in Singapore) then come here. Hard to decide which stall to use so don't be afraid of going upto them to understand how many you get for a certain price and what with. There is also a lot of fish etc. The prices are higher than other hawker centres but then it is inside a major tourist attraction so no surprise there. Popular with tourists and locals so can be very busy. Not much else in the gardens
4
This is a food court within Gardens in the Bay. There is lots of styles of food to choose from and you are able to have different things. We had chicken and beef satay sticks form one stand and then salad and humous from another as well as pineapple juice to drink. We really enjoyed eating here and it felt like a local eatery.
1
Awful selection and terrible food. Worst meal I have had in a long time. We came here after reading the Tripadvisor recommendations. We left with stomach aches. There is no accounting for taste, and this place is a tasteless rip off for tourists and locals alike.
3
There is a lot of offerings here that appear to be cheap e.g. 10 satay sticks for $7, however you will get a shock at how small the helpings are. If you are extremely hungry go elsewhere, but okay if you just want a snack as they do taste delicious
3
We love to visit this place after a brisk walking or cycling around garden by the bay.This place a kind of hawker centre with very reasonable place and quite nice food.There are wide variety of food type from steamboat, bbq grill, seafood, satay, malay food, halal food, fruits and dessert, etc.There are also quite number of satay stall but our favourite always go to satay power, lau pa sat satay branch that we have already got used eating it.This weekend we got try turkish pizza called fide. Taste not bad
4
Located in between Gardens by the Bay and Marina Barrage with a wide variety of local hawker food to choose from. Whilst it is not air conditioned, there's ceiling fans around. There's also ample seats available.
5
Open from 4pm each day. Walk around the back of Gardens By the Bay. Go early if you want to avoid a wait. Open air Hawker Type dining.
5
one of the best place to enjoy satay near the garden by the bay area. It is open place, if rains it is a problem. nice satay, reasonable price.
5
We visited Satay By The Bay after our visit to Gardens At The Bay as it is only a short walk from there. A superb selection of stalls to eat from in a Hawker Style Food Court. We chose from one of the many Satay stalls that cook your Satay to order. Would highly recommend a visit here
5
After a big day wandering around taking in all the nearby sights,this was a wonderful place to sit back and relax with the family including a four year old. There was a huge choice of the local cuisine,all at reasonable prices considering the area we were in.It was all outdoor but under cover. My meal cost $7 and with a Tiger beer ($6),it was very reasonable
4
Gardens by the bay is a bit removed from any reasonable restaurants, except the pricy Indochina or Pollen. Satay by the bay is a glorified hawker center with things sold at a premium price. For example, a jug of beer if S$29.Atmosphere is nice and the access to the Marina walking path is good.Note, if arriving by taxi you can have them drop you off directly there rather than the main entrance to gardens by the day
2
I brought friends to have steamboat buffet and it is disappointing. They imposed all diners to pay and cannot out if 1 of your friends decide not to have steamboat. Topping up of soup is not by staff, you have to do it yourself. Selection of food questionable because most seafood is frozen and meat is not chilled. I would avoid if you have better choices to make!!
4
I'm a Singaporean & I love to go there to eat. The location is great & there are ample parking spaces. You can take a stroll along the bay. Lots of asian food available. The satay was really good & tasty. They are better than some of the local eateries that I've visited.Best time to visit is at about 1800hrs where you can enjoy watching the sunset after dinner.
4
We booked an area with one of the satay vendors for about 15 of us and had a great evening of satay and chicken wings. Loads of other food were available at the hawker centre including load of hokkien mee, grilled sting ray, carrot cake and oyster omelette. Food was exceptional. And so was the location.
5
Satay by the Bay is a traditional, Singapore style Hawker Centre. (Think of it like a covered, but open-air food court.) The food is just as good as at the really famous, older Singapore Hawker Centres (like Maxwell Road), but it's maybe a fraction more expensive because of the location in Gardens by the Bay (only by a dollar or so though).We had amazing, cheap, chilli crab and fried rice from Boon Tat BBQ Seafood, as well as yummy satay from City Satay. There's also a stall that serves beer and cider.As a Hawker Centre it certainly holds its own, and the night we went it was packed with a good mix of locals and tourists. I disagree with previous reviews that say there's no variety. There's more variety here than at a number of food courts and Hawker Centres around town. If you find yourself at Gardens by the Bay, Satay by the Bay is by far the best casual dining option. It's about a 10-15 minute stroll from the MRT station on the other side of the Cloud Dome
4
Set in the beautiful area of gardens at the bay, this food court offers a nice setting with good asian food.
4
I have taken their Mutton Satay and the Katupat Rice many times over and never fail to impress me with their great peanuts sauce. I would recommend this stall to everyone.
4
Seafood, satay, thai food, just name it. There is also a halal steamboat and crab in a pail. more choices for Muslim patrons. I love the atmosphere, always very crowded. The satay and view completes it all.
5
Excellent location in the Gardens by the Bay - it's a bit of a hike from the MRT station but not far if you're walking around the gardens anyway.The food was generally excellent. The satay was amazing and was only 70c/stick. Other favourites included the popiah and the satay bee hoon. Another must try was the 'snow ice' - an icy dessert with fresh fruit which came in flavours like strawberry, mango and even durian!It was very busy. It was quieter at lunch time but not all of the stores were open
4
In Gardens by the Bay, keep following the signs round the outside to Satay by the Bay. It is a food court with many cafes and common tables under cover. We had chicken satay and skewered prawns which we did not better anywhere in Singapore or New Zealand.Also freshly squeezed juices and a fresh mango desert.All for 2 people for less than 1 cocktail at the Sands resort! Both were worth it though.Highly recommended
4
We visited with a group during the week. As tourists, we arrived by taxi. Fortunately we were meeting a local here for dinner or we'd have struggled to find a taxi for return to our hotel. I had thought by the name that this was a restaurant but it's more like an outdoor food court with lots of vendors cooking their chosen dishes. Quite fascinating really. Lots of locals and families eating here. We chose mostly satays but also tried the grilled stingray, chicken wings, and oyster omelette all of which were very good. I understand it can get very crowded here on weekends, but our visit was mid-week so we didn't have a problem nabbing a table. Prices were very good with satays at around 70c per stick. Lots of smoke from the satays and its pretty hot so being bayside I recommend you wear plenty of mozzie repellant... I got hammered here! This is an interesting place to eat and great if you're on a budget although I think because of the mozzies, the difficulty in getting taxis out and the smoke etc., I probably won't return unless in a social group. It sure was an interesting experience, but I think you'll find good satay in lots of places in town... they may be 10c more expensive but guaranteed to be more convenient
3
This 'Hawker' centre is not the one you want to come to if you think yourself a 'foodie' or really just want to eat good Singaporean cheap eats. It's very convenient, a nice safe walk along the water from Gardens by the Bay to have a bite and/or beer open 24hrs but I wouldnt go there just for the food. It's a decent (in a long way) walk to Bayside MRT or Marina Bay sands but close to the domes. A lot of the stalls sell the same thing. There is a section where each stall sells Satay for the same price and same range of combo's, and numerous vendors selling the same seafood dishes, also some international dishes but you can get better elsewhere. Interesting steam boat buffet but was a bit wary of the meats to be honest.I'd probably skip this next time I'm in the gardens and either eat at the Marina Bay sands mall or get the MRT back to a hawker centre in Chinatown close by. It would only be a revisit for convenience sake.
5
This venue is down past the gardens by the bay. About 20 or so venders all wanting your business Lots of smoke and you can smell all the satays and other items cooking before you even reach there. Excellent food at good prices, some of the vendors only selling various drinks. Recommend one stall holder called "Leo Satay ", had their satays and chicken wings
4
Nice choices of street food. Satay are really nice n yummy. But so crowded when we went on Saturday night. Practically can't find even a chair to sit on. Wonder about for 5 min to hunt for a table for a family of 5. But still satisfied with the food. It's quite a distant to walk when we come from Marina bay. It's probably about half an hr of walk. With hungry stomach and young children, it's bit of a challenge. Really envious of those with bikes, roller skates and all sorts of equipment to help accelerate the walk.
3
Went here for a quick dinner after visiting the Gardens by the Bay but before the light show. Satay by the Bay is made up of a bunch of small stands that mainly sell satay (meat on a stick). The atmosphere was lively once the sun set, many tourists sitting around laughing, talking, eating satay, etc. In summary: Nice place to grab a quick dinner in a lively, outdoor setting
4
Location is great following a visit to the Gardens by the Bay conservatories. Satays are not bad. Buying drinks from different vendors was not our friendliest experience. Atmosphere is good. Recommend doing.
4
到新加坡吃沙嗲，大家總聯想起 Lau Pa Sat。 今次到新加坡，本打算帶家人去嚐嚐。 但，當地朋友知道我會到訪 Gardens by the Bay， 便介紹了此處 ~ Satay by the Bay
Satay by the Bay 就在 Gardens 的範圍內，從 Cloud Forest 走過去，只需數分鐘便到達。
Satay by the bay 其實就是1個 hawker centre，有數檔沙嗲、飲品及其他食品。
這裡的環境比別的 hawker centre 開揚清潔，不錯啊。
3
Went there at late night for satay. We try out set catagories but I the satay wasn't cold poperly (uncook for prawn). Can do better...
3
Located in the back of the Gardens by the Bay and often overlooked. An outdoor food court of about a dozen or so food stalls. Plenty of choices. Tried satay - was tasty enough and not expensive, but not outstanding.
5
There are a whole range of stalls that sell from fresh Singaporean cooked seafood to pasta. Satays on sticks were yummy. If only there was sticky rice to accompany. Chicken wings were delicious and crispy. Oyster fried eggs were excellent. Authentic chinese food such as steamed rays and fried noodle tasted great also. Love it
5
If you are in the Gardens by the Bay Area and in need of food, walk 10 minutes towards Satay by the Bay, directions on posts, and enjoy the best choice of food. Don't bother with the Golden Arches or other eateries just visit here and stay for an hour. My children had quite a lot to eat, I had a lot and so did my wife. There is plenty of choice so everyone should be catered for. After food go back and use your re-entry stamp at the attractions and then comeback for dinner. It's clean and spacious, also the toilets are surprisingly clean and well maintained too
5
Did you know you can eat stingray?! I didn't but once I saw you could I had to try it. It was delicious but be careful about bones. The satay was as good as grilled meat can be..which of course is amazing. Multiple stalls to choose from. My impression which could be wrong is that I was getting some street food without the street food risk because it was at the back of gardens by the bay. It was a mix of locals and tourists which also seems like a positive sign. The people were very friendly and the whole area was very clean overall. If you're at gardens of the bat and don't require 5 star ambiance you have to go eat some meat on a stick, at the very least
5
Like most other hawker centers, Satay By the Bay has some great food, but Satay By the Bay is cleaner and more spacious than most other hawker centers. I would highly recommend the Turkish BBQ, it has some of the best hummus I've ever had, and comes with some really great bread which I get almost every time I go. Also, the satay is amazing. The chicken satay is probably the safest bet, but the pork belly is also pretty good and rather fatty. You could try one of the roast prawns, but they take forever to pull apart and really don't seem worth all the time and trouble. The juice stall is also fantastic, and has some of the most original flavours I've tried. Also, it is really healthy, and you can ask them not to add any sugar. I really is just blended fruit that is rather cheap. I would highly recommend coming here around 5:30 and then taking some time to go up the Marina Barrage afterwards. It's really beautiful up there an has an amazing view. Then go down to the Super Tree Grove at about 7:30 if you want a seat for the light show (also highly recommended) which starts around 8:30. The seats will fill up pretty quickly though, so getting down there early would be a good idea
5
This is a nice little hawker center near Gardens by the Bay, with reasonably priced food, cheerful staff, and comfortable outdoor seating. Definitely do try the satay here - the peanut sauce was especially good, not too spicy, just right. If you don't like satay, there are plenty of other choices, too. It's a little far from the Gardens - allow about 10 or 15 minutes to walk to the super-trees if you want to catch the light show
5
This would be my favorite place to eat in Singapore! So many choice, great atmosphere, great tasting fresh food and something for everyone.Our most recent visit was last weekend with some local friends, my parents and hubby and myself. Total o 6 adults and 1 child. Total meal cost $66 plus drinks....which are much cheaper than most other places.Choosing what to eat was easy and our local friends also organised also some of the local cuisine as an extra treat which went down well!! Love love keiu pie te
4
A hawker food court that is well hidden deep in the paths of Gardens By The Bay. Quite a pleasant surprise seeing a foodcourt after several minutes of walking through the Gardens. Lots of cheap hawker food and close to a bay.
5
Have various choices, reasonable prices for steamboat and great customer service. Not to mention free flow of drinks, 1 ice cream per person and hey does this reminds you of seoul garden? Try it out guys
4
This hawker center is a little pricier than others but still a great deal just by Gardens By The Bay.
The view of the bay and Marina Bay Sands is great.
5
What a great place to try all kinds of different food dishes, very tasty and filling. Prices are good to. Highly recommend trying this place while you are in the area..
5
If you like satay and authentic food, it is the place to be. Great location in gardens by the bay, very good satay. I would just recommand it for any visit at gardens by the bay
3
Pretty run-of-the-mill setup no different from any hawker centre you'd find in Singapore. Variety of food choices is there but the prices don't match the food quality.

A sampling of the hawker-style offerings at Satay by the Bay is a great way to wind up a visit to Singapore's wonderful Gardens by the Bay complex. A wide selection of Singapore's local delicacies are available from a few dozen stalls. You make your food choices at one or more of the outlets then sit on small stools at a low table to await delivery. Most dishes are in the $S8-12 range. We tried the stingray offering, amongst others - it was delicious. Freshly squeezed fruit drinks (papaya, kiwi fruit, watermelon, pineapple, etc) are available for a very reasonable $S4. Highly recommended

We were recommended to walk to this Hawker Center after the Light Show at Gardens by the Bay. It was a bit of a hike, but interesting scenery on the way and well worth the walk as it turned out. It was a very hot night so the breeze was very welcome along with the choices of food and prices. This is one of the smaller Hawker Centers, but has plenty of choices and also is cheaper than some of the others around. I highly recommend any one attending the light show to venture on and sample some of the finest satay's in Singapore

We brought our guests from England to Satay by the Bay and they enjoyed the food and the bustling ambience. We had the seafood bucket and satay. After the dinner we went to the Barrage and the children were doing cartwheels in the dark and trying to catch the stars shining so brightly. It was a great outing for all.

Firstly, it's not a restaurant. It is a hawker center with a collection of stallholders offering anything from Satay to the traditional/local stir-fry dishes. Get the usual Asian food fixes here. No fixed seating, though the seats are fixed (ie to the floor). Can be quiet during lunch but said to be buzzing in the evening. Prices are ok, though I balked at the S$9.50 nasi bryani set. Had the Roti Prata instead for S$3.60 (two eggs prata).Did not try the Satay since its lunch but would not consider the per stick price to be overly exorbitant considering it is located within a tourist attraction. Actually just a few minutes walk from the conservatories (map makes it seem far) after the children's garden. Good place for a meal and drink before heading to the Marina barrage
3
Nice hawkers food in the middle of the garden. Better to visit at night since it could be pretty hot
4
been to this place a few times and recently was in July when i got a couple of friends who visited this Singapore, the satay is nice , its just a smoky encounter which adds up the ambiance and feel
5
OMG this place was FAB. Delicious food and big serves ... We loved it here and found it one of the best places to eat in Singapore. Great atmosphere too :)
5
We enjoyed a yummy lunch when we visited Satay by the Bay.After touring through the domes at Gardens By The Bay we decided to walk down to Satay by the Bay.It was definitely worth the walk, as we love satay.We ordered a large amount for a reasonable price and were very happy.It recharged our batteries to continue walking through the gardens in the afternoon
4
A popular spot for locals, which is strange considering that it is "out of the way".Available food ranges from all-you-can-eat Malaysian food through traditional Asian meals and, of course, Satay! Multiple satay vendors compete with each side-by-side so I tried to give some business to the more lonely-looking vendors. They all have the same price.Great shaved-ice desserts are available, too
4
After a really long walk and feeling very warm, we stopped at 'Satay by the Bay' for a nice cold drink and a tasty serve of satay sticks. The breeze blows throught the middle of the outdoor Restaurant (Food Stalls) Totally delightful. Just enough refuelling before our trek to the Train Station and more sight seeing
2
My first visit to satay by the bay, probably my last. Food were expensive and yet in small portion...felt really really cheated esp when i bought the $10 & $6 prawn noodles...portion looks almost the same.. taste was not like a "must eat"...even though they are supposed to be famous for it.. seriously you can get loads more delicious food elsewhere... If not for bringing friends to marina barrage, would not have chosen it to be my dinner venue.
4
We visited the botanic gardens and had lunch at Satay by the Bay. First, the location is OK, there is a bit of water outlook but it feels slightly isolated with few other buildings nearby. The gardens, of course, are quite nice.There are about 12 different food stalls, including several seafood, satay and drinks/desserts. The pricing is very reasonable and the quality seems good. Satay stalls are a bit more outdoors. Going at night, we would hope to get a better atmosphere (more flames and smoke) and more stalls open; around half were closed when we visited for lunch
5
Huge range of stalls to choose from. The satay is so cheap and tasty. Great family atmosphere without feeling it is over run with children! Staff very friendly, a range of seating , we tried to sit at the very low tables and chairs but moved to the regular tables to be more comfortable. Great place to eat before you go to the light show in the gardens
5
There will be a few stalls selling Satay. I can recommend the halal ones sold by the Malay vendors only. The best one is the first stall; nearer to the hawker seats. You need to love peanut sauce. Other things to try - i can only vouch for halal serving stalls: the turkish stall, their pide is good stuff (backfacing the satay stalls - this stall is on your right). If you need fried chicken, this chinese but halal stall ( backfacing the satay stalls - this stall will be on your left) serves good tasting fried chicken. Other dishes by these stalls are just as good. But the best to eat, is as per what i stated above. Price wise, if for 2 pax, it should not be more than $60. Please note, you need to walk there from the Gardens or from Marina Barrage. Either way, good scenic view to walk
5
Satay by the Bay was a brilliant place for a meal while exploring the Gardens on the Bay.
Service was wonderful and the food delicious.
4
First meal after arriving in Singapore, and it was delicious! Several types of satay made to order, with plenty of options for drinks and other dishes if you're not in the mood for the satay itself. Not too crowded and many friendly people.
5
Satays cooked freshly for order were wonderful with many varieties available. Food Court concept with many other stores available to order food/drink/fruit from. Fruit is packaged in little plastic bags and is so fresh and wonderful.
3
I go to visit there when weekends...it's hard to find an empty seats...the satay is delicious, but the place is very crowded, hot n also very humid cause near the bay.
5
My second time here. This time i took locals that did not know about it. Wonderful selection of food and drink. It has a great view to compliment. Highly recommend. I'll look for this place every time i visit.
5
This is a food court with lots of yummy options to suit all ages and taste buds. The tables are clean and the service was prompt. It was divine to find this place after a long afternoon of exploring the gardens. Definitely recommend.
5
We had the best satay here, for a good price. The ambiance is great, as you sit outdoors and there are very low tables and chairs. They can be a bit uncomfortable, but we thought they added to the experience! Highly recommend this place for a casual dinner
1
Forgot the name of the stall but this stall also sells fried oyster omelette and fried carrot cake. It's beside Noodle & Laksa stall and facing towards the satay sellers. The Hokkien mee has a foul smell and taste. I guess the broth that they have used to cook the dish has gone bad. After eating it, I had stomach pain, diarrhea and fever for the next 2 days. My family and I were eating the same things but I was the only one who have eaten the hokkien mee so I'm pretty sure it's caused by the hokkien mee. I'm definitely not going back to patronize the stall again
4
The food here was great and there was a huge range of stalls all offering different types of food. The satay was great but the other food was also really good. The atmosphere is great and you can hear the music coming from the garden show and see the gardens lit up at night. Affordable food with a great range of selection
5
Excellent lunch/dinner option when visiting Gardens by the Bay. This is a collection of different vendors, many offering Satay but also we had some delicious Turkish food.Its not air conditioned, so make sure to grab a table under the fans.Cash Only - no Credit cards. Also, no paper napkins for diners - so bring a few with you.Highly Recommended as a fun and affordable option in Singapore
5
Stopped by after checking out gardens by the bay. So much choice and every counter offers different food. We had beef, chicken and pork satay (of course), carrot cake, sting ray, beer, and sugar cane juice.
1
Visited with family. This place was crowded and looked promising until we ordered mee goreng for $7.50; frozen roti prata for $4... Everything else was similarly over-priced. Enough said.
5
We had dinner here before heading off to see the light show in the Gardens, nice atmosphere good food, busy the Sunday we were there.
5
Definitely must visit especially if you are in the vicinity of the Gardens of the Bay. Satays are barbecued fresh & tastes really yummy. Pricing are really reasonable as well. Plus you get to enjoy lovely views of the Bay. Dining is alfresco. Afterwards take a leisurely walk along the Bay to enjoy the sea Breeze & work off some calories.
4
I visited a few nights ago I've been to Singapore many times but just never got here I wish I had. It was so good they choices are endless for satay there are many stalls selling food from satay to seafood, curries Turkish the list goes on. There a big fans around that keep you cool, I think in the day it may become very hot at night it was fine. I will be back before I leav
5
What an experience this place is! From the moment you walk down the pathway into this unlikely hive of steamboats, satay and chilli crab the atmosphere and smells take you over. Set out like a well established Hawkers Market this outdoor quasi-food-court has something for everyone. Although our very informative cab driver insisted this was not the best place for Satay - it was still very very good...and cheap! We also had freshly made prata with curry sauce and the most succulent chicken wings that had been lovingly charred over hot coals that were to die for. If you're headed to the Gardens and want something authentically local, quick and cheap - you simply cannot go past this place. If we had a bigger group we would have gone for the steamboat experience which it seemed that many locals had come especially for. Great local experience and one that will take you by surprise. We will be back.
5
This is a good place for a meal, and is worth the 10-15 minute walk if you are visiting Gardens by the Bay. There are many stalls here, offering a wide variety of local food.There is no air-conditioning here, so it is probably better to go for dinner when it is not too hot
4
So many little stalls..all calling you to try their wares.We tried the chicken and beef satays.Whilst they were not busy...we went on a Thursday night at around 6pm we found we had to wait quite a while for them to be ready.We also had some seafood from a corner stall...don't remember the name but it was really good
1
And if you take a taxi there you could well be stranded there for ages. A taxi driver recommended this place - ugh! We were fortunate in that we managed by fluke to get a taxi out of this dump reasonably quickly - to the food court at Little India, which was vibrant, cheap interesting and a tad grubby (but none of us four got sick) - fantastic food there, but Satay by the Bay?? Awful.
3
This place is near Garden by the bay and gives you an alternative from the western food (McDonalds) found at the actual gardens. Quite nice, fresh and cheap and gives you a variety of meats. The complex also had a variety of other cuisine and foods which go well with the satay
4
I was already won over before arriving just by the smell of the place! So much variety of food on offer and a great atmosphere. Best place for satay!
4
The satays and BBQ wings have always been my staple when I visit this place because they are simply good!
1
Arrived at the food center for early dinner. Noodle look and taste like leftover from the night before. Diarrhea starts after 2 hours and left me sick for several days.
Not trying this stall ever.
4
We had a few orders: Wholly Crab, Chicken & Pork Satay, Chicken Wings, grill cockles (seaham-in cantonese), single serving of cantonese noodle, sweet potato/tapioca fries abd drinks. It was great fun eating everything with your hands served literally on the table at a reasonable price.
4
Situated in far corner away from Gardens by the Bay, we walked for about 15 minutes with clear signboards directing us to this place. We tried the stingray ($12) and satay ($7 for 10), it was really good and worth the price. However, the Ice Kachang was seriously overprice
3
Food options are generally similar to what you can find in other Singapore food courts - chicken wings, fried oyster, spring rolls, fried Hokkien Noodles, grilled fish, etc etc. Nothing exceptionally bad and nothing to shout about either. If you are too far from this location, don't bother
5
If you are a nature loving and outdoor person, you will love this place. I come here not for the food, but to zone out and be at one with nature (while in the comforts of food and drinks). The surrounding views of serenity is worth much more than the food. Accompanied by birds while having coffee, and seeing the iconic marina bay sands draped in rainforest foliage. A beautiful blend of concrete with nature
4
It's basically a tourist place in my opinion. But there are good options and the food I've had has been great. If you're a tourist, this is a good place to get a first time hawker experience. You'll pay more money but it's not bad and the prices are still good compared to what I would pay anywhere in the US for food court food. So it's a good place but not great in my opinion
5
Truly authentic satay and the best value going. Twice we dined here and we should have come more...however always next time.We chose City Satay who reckon they have the best. Seemed like the best to me but all of the other satay stalls offered similar fare for similar price. City Satay were very obliging and even altered out set order to suit us which I was very impressed with.Truly a delightful taste sensation which allows people to taste what satay should really be like, not the rubbish served in Australia and other western countries
4
I will judge this by primarily Ambience since there can't many open places , open air eating places that are so pleasant in Singapore. Come at about 630pm to enjoy the Sunset and skyline.My 10th visit here, generally breezy or the big ceiling fans are well serviced! Our kids scootered around freely . Greenery around is nice Fish pond with Koi - we brought fish food with us , or buy at 26 @ marina bar and bistro for $2 per packet.Food : this is a hawker center food ( stalls selling local food ) that demands a premium . You pay 20-30% more here but is worth the ambience. Satay is $7 for 10 sticks. ( usual $5-6 ) 2 Adults , 3 kids = $85 . ( 40 satay sticks, 1 Truffle fries , 1 jug beer, 3 soda drinks 
4
We visited satay on the bay after visiting the marina bay sands shopping centre. Planning to visit the gardens and then see the gardens by night. The chicken satay sticks were delicious. We will definitely be back
3
Variety of food choices, chicken wings and grilled prawns were good for snacking. Took the outdoor seat since the inside was pretty warm. A convenient place to take a break from the walking in the park.
5
A great place to eat after visiting Gardens by the Bay. Traditional Hawker style delicious satay juxtaposed against the futuristic gardens!
5
(a) steamboat + bbq buffet @ $27-29 for weekendsMONSTER CRABS, prawns, fish, chicken, mutton, lamb, lala, other seashells etc.very good selection, with potong ice cream for dessertspacked to the brim.we had no reservations hence waited 1 hr.recommend to reserve in advance.(b) nice ambiance, definitely beats lau pasat hands down. bring your foreign friends here!(c) offer plenty of other local and international (some) food options.(d) location wise its definitely not as convenient as other places, but definitely worth the trouble.(e) view of the bay at night is breath taking. stroll to mbs is awesome.will come again very soon
4
Went here on weekday evening, quite busy but no problems finding a seat. As the name suggests there are a lot of satay stalls but also a good range of other types of food, with lots of seafood options available. There is also a nice bar (for hawkers) with drinks at OK prices. Overall it's relatively upmarket and a bit more expensive as its in a touristy area right next to the gardens but it's worth the extra couple of bucks
3
The satay is ok... There is a variety to choose from but none of them looked particularly outstanding. What was outstanding however, though the dish itself didn't look great, was the seafood noodles. It was delicious! The stall is at the back of the complex, but there is only one seafood noodle stall in the food court so it should become apparent. For drinks, my recommendation is freshly squeezed sugar cane juice; absolutely divine.
3
We went here to eat after spending the day at Gardens by the Bay, so it was convenient. The idea is great but the satays were nowhere near as good as the ones we had at Lau pa sat. Not bad though in terms of convenience and atmosphere.
2
Ate at the stall Marina Live Seafood & Steamboat My fish porridge arrived, looked very different to as shown in the menu, hardly any fish and no dried onions. Asked about the picture being so different and showing ingredients not there on the dish and was told "this picture only! "Staff are very rude.They wanted to be paid halfway through eating our mealWould not recommend at al
1
All the workers have serious attitude problem. They should learn what service is. Don't even waste your day to come here. Food here is not fantastic and overpriced. If you want to find a place to get your blood boiling,I give a 10/10 for this place
4
Satay in Singapore is just really nice wherever you try it. The main difference is about this place is the relaxing ambience and the stroll before or after pigging out on very good satay. The walk along the bay is peaceful and it's a really a cheap weekend thrill..to get away from the bustling city noise. Add the free lights show at the skyway area in the gardens and the trip to this place is truly worth it
4
We walked the long way in the heat to get here, we thought it was going to be a restaurant. It's a food court but the good is cheap and the sat says were good.
3
Food here is expensive & standard is average. If you take bus 400 from international plaza (exit Tanjong Pagar Mrt), it wouldnt take long. Nice sceneries as you take a short walk from here to the flower dome. Wheelchair accessible.
5
Visited this place after a visit at the flower dome and cloud forest. It's indeed worthy to try. Many local food variety. Satay is a must to try.
4
This is a new complex (at least to me) and is a bit like the old style hawker stalls still to be found in little india.Plenty of different stalls offering a variety of food, and one offering beers and such.Ambience set between the barrage and gardens by the bay cant be beaten
4
Lights, no cameras, but ACTION! At Satay By The Bay, there was a cluster of small ''restaurants''. As the name suggests, it is located ''by the bay''. The food was very ''street food styled''. I love satay, but there isn't just satay. There are other things like curry, meatballs and other cuisine if you would like to indulge. It is quite easy to get to, as there are many ways to get there. You can take the MRT to either Marina Bay Station (NS27, CE2), or Bayfront Station (CE1, DT16). Likewise, you can take a bus to Satay By The Bay. I would certainly recommend Satay by the Bay
5
I am a huge fan of satay, so when I saw the signs for Satay by the Bay at the Gardens by the Bay there was nothing for it but to strike out and find the place - it's a bit of a walk to earn your satay, but well worth it. The food was cheap, fast and plentiful and of great quality. Don't expect silver service - this is pretty basic - plastic tables and chairs and a communal style eatery, but it was clean and the staff friendly. Lack of public transport down to the venue might put some people off as it was a good 10 minute walk and in the heat & humidity of Singapore that can take it out of you. We also got caught in a thunderstorm on the return leg & got soaked, so be prepared!
4
Located at the very corner of Singapore , the pretty sky line view is worth the trip. Packed with a wide variety of food option, moreover so with Halal certified stores offering satay to steamboat and normal local delish. Best to come on weekdays and night time to enjoy the cooling atmosphere. Great for a family or friend catch up session!
5
Such a busy place, so many different food stalls. There really is something for everyone. A great experience in the hustle and bustle, everyone trying to sell you their food and then sitting at short tables and chairs to eat. It was great fun, recommend it to anyone.
4
We went on a rainy Saturday lunchtime and about half the stalls were shut unfortunately. I don't know whether it's usually more of an evening place.Still, it was a good place to shelter from the rain and we had excellent chicken laksa from one of the venders
4
As with all tourist sites, this is a pricey place to visit. As a local, some times we do droo by for its proximity to Gardens by the Bay and Marina Barrage which are both great places for a family weekend outing. However, if you are already there, plan your food order after your look through the numerous selection of food. Must try will be the satay stalls that makes skeweres satay on the spot over the fire. Try the bbq sotong ( octopus ) and otah ( fish cake wrapped in coconut leaves ). Order a rice cake ( kataput - in malay ) and ask for more peanut sauce. The way to enjoy your satay is to dip the sticks of meat into the peanut sauce. You will love it. Many friends from overseas love the texture of the peanutty sauce, some says it taste like peanut butter jam some says it taste like a creamy sweet n spicy sauce peppered with nuts. Get in hand a glass of beer or cold coconut water before you dive into them as you might likely be set on fire from the sizzling spiciness. However... You will likely live it and remember it as the unique taste of this Malay cuisine from Singapore.
4
Satay by the Bay is a collection of small hawker style stalls offering authentic cuisine of Singapore. Majority of stalls are reasonably priced and is a great opportunity to take a break from wandering around the gardens.
4
Good location to enjoy Food Court food satay, seafood, kebabs washed down with Tiger Beer! Staying at Marina Bay sands have a short walk and enjoy quality food at reasonable prices.
5
Satay by the bay, is one of my favourite places to visit when I am in Singapore. It has lots of food of good quality and the price is outstanding. It has Singaporean food, Arabic food, USA food, English food and more.
4
My wife and I had dinner here, after walking in Gardens by the Bay. We ate satay, grilled prawns and chendol. Drank coconut juice from a fresh coconut.
4
An outdoor foodcourt that offers an array of Satay goods as well as some Western Food, Alcohol and others. Most of the Satay places are priced the same, you should pay about $7 for 10 Chicken Satay Sticks. Don't be afraid to grab 10 or more because the sticks are small! But very good. I also ordered a few Pork Belly sticks for $1.50 SGD each. To bulk up your meal go to a place that sells rice cakes as well- about $1 each (again, quite small- I bought 2). Excellent environment and the lovely smell of BBQ! Nice to be able to have a drink while you eat, something fo everyone here.
4
Had some great Satay here after a morning at Gardens by the Bay/. You go up and order yourself, and then get your drink s from another bar, if you want serviettes you have to pay, but this i all about the food (SATAY) which is excellent. Has a nice view of the city scape and you can get a cab back home, from the front of the restaurant..
4
I got the MRT to Bayfront Station and had a very long walk through to Satay by the Bay at about 7pm. It was crowded and as I was tired from walking I went to the first Satay stall I saw. I ordered 10 chicken sticks and paid Sgd$7. It was a very long wait and I had to go and check on my order. It was worth the wait as the Satay were yummy and the curry peanut sauce was delicious. I wish I had ordered 20 instead of 10.Next time I visit I will investigate the Shuttle Bus, or a public bus to the far side of the Gardens which will get me closer to Satay by the Bay
4
Have been dining few days back with family and friends. Crowded on weekend as usual. This is a food court concept. You can find satay and seafood here. If you are two persons. You can order $15 couple set. Reasonable price. Walking distance from Gardens by the bay
4
You get your satay and other hawker stall offering. However, a plus is the view of the bay and MBS. The evening setting is nice. Its not crowded, can easily get a table even for big groups, Was there with a party of 5, because it was relatively empty, we get to choose where to sit and get the best of the scenery. However, food is pricey there
4
First thing's first, its not a restaurant it is a food market. There is a large choice of vendors selling different Asian cuisine. Some seem more up market than others, some will provide you with a buzzer which will go off when your food is ready and you can return to pick it up. The vendor we chose did not do this but assured us they would bring us the food after we described where we were sitting, after half an hour we had to return to get our food which was beginning to get cold and were told they could not find us. The food was delicious but a couple of bits of the chicken were dangerously under-cooked and inedible but when you get 50 satays to a serving that is not really a huge problem so long as you don't eat the under-cooked ones. There are plenty of vendors to choose from so best to select one that seems popular with locals. There is a bar which serves relatively cheap, cold beer which is a bonus. There undercover area was quite smokey and very warm but the deck area was overcrowded so we couldn't sit there but this is the spot I would recommend to sit if you can. It was quite difficult to get a place to sit but we were later told this was an unusually busy day due to it being a national holiday
4
This food market is an excellent place to have a break if you are in gardens by the bay. Wide variety of food at very affordable prices. Cold beer was a bonus.
4
Very convenient when you are already inside the Gardensbythebay and wanted a place to eat. Satay is a must try. Ambience is really good.
4
This is a food court serving an excellent selection of food. I had chicken, beef and prawn Sarah. S$34 for 10 skewers of each. The sauce was fabulous. We found a table first then ordered letting them know where we were sitting
2
Good food, but the rest was kinda a letdown. Staff were rude, many didn't speak English at all, and the venue was cramped and hard to navigate. Food stalls didn't start serving food until over 30 minutes later than advertised in their karts. The food was nice and good value, just a shame the rest ruined the experience
5
We had tea at Satay by the Bay before the light show at the Supertrees Grove, not much of a walk really, we saw signs telling us where to go. The food was delicious, you have a big choice of vendors selling different food, once you've chosen you go back to your table and wait til the buzzer your given goes off, the wait was not long at all. We had satays and noodles, inexpensive and delicious, beer is really cheap in Singapore, so only a few dollars for a huge glass
4
Visited on our visit to the gardens. It's a little walk from the main part of the gardens, but there's some good food there and it's not expensive, although it is more costly than other hawker stalls in Singapore. Note that not at stalls were open during our lunchtime visit, and the stalls are located outdoors in a covered area
4
We had 2 serves of the mixed satay sticks beef, mutton and chicken from City Satay.All of the satay sticks were cooked well and had a great taste.This was about $20 for 30 sticks.After this I had a small pizza from stall 19 and it was $4.90.Also quite nice.The main drink stall was from $1.80 each.This is a beautiful area and a great place to grab a feed with friends or family
4
We were there for lunch on a weekday - it's a 10 - 15 minute walk from Gardens by the Bay. Be aware that not every stall is open at lunchtime. However, we still got some good food - satay sticks are SG$7 for 10, or SG$13 for 20. Delicious!
3
Take a train to Bayfront MRT station on the Downtown Line. Walk for about 15 min to reach Gardens by the Bay. Satay by the Bay lies between Gardens by the Bay and Marina Barrage. It faces the Marina Reservoir.  There are about 5 stalls selling satay at this food centre. The sellers use charcoal fire to roast their satay. However the quality is not as good as those sold at Queen Elizabeth Walk in the 1950s. There are other stalls selling seafood, beer, pizza, and Turkish food. The area is well ventilated as it is near the sea. The environment is clean but the price of the food is rather expensive compared to those found in the local food centres. The place is crowded on weekends but there are sufficient tables and chairs for diners. However for good food, I would rather to to Chinatown or Little India where you can get the best local Chinese and Indian food
2
Many varieties of Singaporean food. Very over price and service really unacceptable. The food was not fantastic especially the prata and the satay the curry & satay sauce were tasteless. Ordered oyster omelette and found shell in it. Feedback to the stall owner and only respond given was 'oh really! '. My gum was bleeding and they don't bother at all.
3
Went there on a Friday noon time, hoping to get some famous satay, the two featured one not opened yet. Tried the rest, food is okay. Probably try again next time.
5
This was my second visit to Satay by the Bay and it was as delightful as the first time. It has a great location and the satay is wonderful. It is reasonably priced and lots of other food options if satay is not your thing.
5
Excellent quality and tasty (Satay) out-in open air in a very organized and clean setting. 5 minutes walk from Gardens by the Bay. If you like Satay this is a must visit.
5
The street food in Singapore was the main purpose of our long weekend trip to the city and we werent disappointed. First thing to remember is this is street food served at the counter and eaten on fixed picnic type tables. No white table cloths or place settings and if you want it you get it yourself. the four of us went for the 50 assorted meat satays with a bowl of laksa, fried carrot cake ( Not carrot or cake but a radish omlette) and Kway teow (fried spicy noodles)with fresh sugar cane juice and a jug of Tiger beer to wash it all down. The seating arrangements are ad hoc, when you find a space, hold it while the rest go and order. Be prepared to share a table or missout completely. we went on sunday which was packed and monday which was quiet. the eating area is covered but it is outside so no aircon but there are fans. The food was good and reasonably priced but not cheap and alcohol is definitely expensive (compared to UK). It is located in the Gardens by the Bay which make for a very pleasant walk afterwards
2
Had a staycation at MBS and was feeling hungry for food that we decided to call Mcdonald's for delivery. Unfortunately that day that the estimated delivery time would take 2hrs to get to us. Instead of waiting we have decided to grab a bite at the nearby "food court" - hoping that there's something to save our tummy.Nothing much was left except 1 of the satay stall & this prata stall (open for 24hrs). the time that we were there was after 12mn. very quiet place but I suppose when you've got not much choices to choose from, that's all you can settle down for.Nothing fantastic to shout out, but just something to save the tummy from going hungry. After this experience I suppose that if you're REALLY hungry for food, just head to Lao Pa Sa even though the distance to walk over is further. You probably have more choice (I suppose) compared to just 1 prata stall at satay by the bay

Since our fav Newton is closed for upgrading, no choice but to try out satay by the bay. 1st impression for this place, well in fairness they have good sea view and windy. But I would never go back there anymore due to their lousy and poor attitude for some of the stalls owner,especially the stall selling oyster egg. The food there are nothing special. And most of the food stalls there are not those specially choose. Unlike Newton circle, Wisma and Ion food court. The stall and food are kinda famous and popular in singapore and thus they are chosen to be part of it. Satay there are just so so. Just go to Lau Pa Sai for best satay if you want.

If you don't take the little trains/buggies them on a hot day you'll certainly need a rest! I was boiling walking along, stupidly no water or shade umbrella OR sunscreen, silly girl!Ate plenty of Satay and my husband got a tasty chicken rice, pretty location, worth a trip here
3
Approximately a 30 min walk from the Marina Bay with a variety of different cuisines to choose from.The meals we had were average when compared to authentic Malaysian cuisine.Overall the Chinese cuisine were average in my opinion but the Satay dish was a delight to have.Freshly squeezed cane juice is also a popular choice among the locals
5
Satay by the Bay was a great stop. We met some local friends who were giving us a ride down to see Gardens at the Bay, and we stopped here for a quick bite before heading to the 'loght show.Hawker Centres are awesome, and Satay by the Bay was near the top. By the time we were done ordering there was way too much food for 4 people, but we had a 'cleaner' (a human food vacuum) The Satay was exceptional, as was the other choices selected by our hosts. On the 'must go' list for Singapore
5
Satay by the Bay is a slightly upscale hawker stand in Gardens by the Bay, an ecologically PC botanical garden which is worth visiting by itself. There were a number of different satay stands, as well as stands of Chinese seafood, Turkish food (hummus in Singapore!), claypots. We had an order of Satay (minimum 10 skewers) - shrimp, fish, beef, chicken all grilled while we watched. Still hungry I found a perfect dish of crispy noodles with seafood at a seafood barbecue stand. We shared out table with a delightful Indian family. Unbelievably inexpensive and wonderful, and the location was great. Trip Advisor asks 'is it fast food.' Depends on how you define it - the food was cooked when we ordered it (not kept on a warming table like American fast food), but it sure came fast
3
You ca eat all the kind of food you want, satay but also nice fish or shrimps. For everybody something!
4
A wide range of different food outlets in a food court development that offers satay but a whole lot more. A very welcome stop a hen spending a day in the gardens.
3
If you have other options to choose from - take a wise call. Good Satay stands - good local stuff and not too expensive. No options for vegetarians.
5
smokey but month-watering smoke from Satay stands
you have other options from seafood, Indian, Thai, Turkish etc
not expensive and you can enjoy night view of central business district skyscrapers
3
Satay by the Bay is a very big hawker food complex. There are about 15 to 20 different stands offering everything from seafood to Asian. It is not really stylish to eat here, but if you want the eat somewhere with a lot of choice this is your place. If I had to compare it, I would compare it to a huge Asian shopping malls food corner.
3
It is a good destination and the best available option in Gardens by the bay. The satay here are OK. I felt the satay at La Pau Sat better than here. Beer and drinks are expensive here .You get other options like Indian, Turkish, Malay here
3
Had satay, carrot cake, oyster omelette, chicken wing and sugar cane drink. The stuff are kind of pricey. The taste of satay and chicken wings are not too bad though for this price, very likely we can get it elsewhere. The attraction is that we pay for the environment. Away from tall buildings. Guess the rental and the environment cost quite a bomb
4
We had lunch here while we were visiting Gardens by the Bay. We were at Satay by the Bay at pretty much 12pm on the dot. Which turned out to be quite good as we were able to get served and get our food quickly before the lunch rush turned up - which was pretty soon after. Satay was great, cheap and tasty. Nice place to stop for a while on a hot day, the fans in the undercover eating section provided nice relief from the heat
3
This place is at the other end of the Garden, so bare your feet for a far walking distance.We went there for dinner on a Saturday evening. There were lots of people, but we managed to find seatings.We really enjoyed the night view from here, where we could see the Esplanade & Singapore Flyer.There were various options of food. Unfortunately, the food we ordered wasn't really satisfying. The satay was rather sweet, while in Indonesia we are used to eat savory satays. No biggie, maybe that's how Singaporeans like their satays
4
If you come to Singapore and you're simply looking out for good local food, you'll come across the name "hawker centre" however do not get irritated by the pronunciation... here it's all about food, very good local food from different cultures in different variations. A must before you decide to go have luxury gourmet etc.... Ask any Singaporean, they'll give you some directions. This one however is easy to find, just follow the signs. Yes, agree some people have said it's crowded, in my opinion a sign, that the food is acceptable. Every person has a different taste, try it out and make your own experience, it's worth a try.
5
good place to have full tummy. very cheap and lots of different choices. this was absolutely best and the cheapest place where i ate in singapore
4
I am a local Singaporean, and I know where to find, in our local neighbourhood hawker centres, cheap & good satay. However, I must say that at Satay By The Bay, I found one stall: Sri Geylang Sate, which is priced reasonably. The food quality is also good. I always order the combination sets, which comes with satay & grilled prawns. The price is also comparable to some of the neighbourhood hawker centres'. Yet, the atmosphere is much better, with the spacious area & the view of sea at the Marina area
2
I wouldn't recommend dinner at restaurants in the Satay By The Bay. The area is so crowded with people. It'll be a long wait before vacant seats can be found. Even when seats are found, the tables have yet to be cleaned. In addition, food there isn't cheap and service provided aren't as good as those found in the city. When there are so many customers, can cooks prepare good meals by rushing to fill the orders? We ordered a dish of curry crab but ended up eating the shell and the garnish. There was hardly any meat
3
Dont expect anything topclass, it s hawkerstalls, 20 satay for S$ 13, but also lots of other asian food and even kebab and pizza. Crowded, average quality, expensive beers at S$ 7,50. Option if you are already in the gardens, if not, go somewhere else if you want real good food
3
We went here to try the satay. It took almost 40 minutes to be served to us. But once it was, it was quite tasty. The portions were fairly large and the peanut sauce was delicious. We also tried fried rice and that was quite nice as well.I would recommend this place to anyone visiting gardens by the bay, but beware that during rush hours you may be left waiting
4
Enjoyed Satay By the Bay. You are under large tarps with fans so this is a good place to get refreshed from being in the sun or get out of the rain. We had some difficulty actually finding it but eventually we did. Lots of vendors to pick from. Cheap food too
4
Visit this place with friends from overseas to get some nice hawker food, the satay, fried carrot cake, hokkien mee and popiah is really good. We also got a seat at the back facing Gardens by the bay and Marina Bay Sands, the view through out the night is lovely
5
We've been twice now while visiting the gardens on separate trips. Both times the satay has been wonderful - it is what keeps us coming back!This time we were traveling with friends - one of whom is very adventurous with his food & enjoyed a bowl of chilli frog! The serving size was huge & he thoroughly enjoyed the flavours.We got 'stuck' there during a downpour, so made the most by enjoying a jug of Tiger beer at happy hour while waiting for the rain to subside :-)Whenever in Singapore we try and eat Hawker style as much as possible for value and taste - Satay by the Bay hasn't let us down yet
5
Singapore is quite expensive so as a backpacker I cannot afford going to restaurants there. But in my opinion it is not necessary, with Satay by the Bay for example there is a wonderful place in a great setting where I could eat excellent food for under 10 Dollars. Love the possibilities to choose from different food stalls and after eating I like the pleasant walk through Gardens by the Bay to digest
3
Quite a walk to get here from the gardens if that is the way you a coming and horrendously busy with not a large range of options. After an interminable wait for a seat we grabbed a few satay sticks on our sticky table and then were on our way. Wouldn't be back
4
Great place for a wide variety of Singapore Hawker food.. Plenty of selections available, clean, lots of seating space. Reasonable prices...
1
We heard that in a pretty big tourist attraction (gardens by the bay) there was actually a food hall as a lunch option. Yes! Thinking we'd actually skip the tourist trap food rip off experience you normally get at these attractions we were pleased to go to Satay by the Bay during our day at GBTB. It was not to be so..... sad little stalls, empty tables, overpriced food that was terrible. The Satay was ok, nothing amazing and very overpriced. The Indian stall doing filled roti was awful. The seafood noodles we got were inedible. The drinks watery and tasteless. The only place that was ok (and just ok) was the BBQ chicken wing place. We visited 5 hawker halls on our 6 day stay and they were all fabulous... this one was off the scales awful.I believe it USED to have a good name for itself (was formerly the satay club or something?) but has since been changed and unfortunately still rides on its old reputation. I'd head elsewhere for food at GBTB like the other indoor food area that had about 4 or 5 places in it (more like a western food court) we passed on the way out, closer to the main hub of the gardens.
4
Just behind Satay by the Bay is a water-lily pond and if you are into catching some of Singapore's bird life, this is the place to be in the early morning before it gets too hot. It really is quite active with birdlife as well as bird photographers
5
We regularly come here and have tried out a number of different satay stalls. Overall we had expoerienced that in particular the beef is rather dry and hard. When you select a chinese stall the also offer pork, simply delicious. Of course you can also experience many other food from the foodstall around but be prepared to find the prices a bit at the tourist level, especially seafood. During the week you can enjoy happy hour beer prices before 7
4
We had a 7 hour layover in Singapore for a quick visit with friends and a bite to eat. I went for the Singapore Classic chilli crab, our local friends ordered satay sticks, chicken, beef, liver and tripe all were really delicious and an omelette stuffed with prawns and rice. Everything was really good. Although pretty expensive. Next time we'll head to a hawker place
3
A nice location in the gardens, and with a nice view of the Marina barrage. Essentially this is an outdoor food court. There are many satay vendors to choose from, and the satay I had (mixed chicken and beef sticks) was pretty good, if a little overpriced. There was also plenty of seafood and other options to choose from. Good for dinner after a stroll around the gardens or across the barrage.
5
As always, one of my favourite places to eat when I come to Singapore and it never disappoints. I actually dream about the satay as my holiday gets closer. i have to say my travelling companions are now totally hooked on the satay experience. For years they have heard me rave about it and now, having experienced it themselves, finally know what I have been raving about. My parents first introduced me to 'The Satay Club' almost 30 years ago, and it is always one of the highlights and best experiences, next to High Tea at Raffles, of my Singapore holidays. I just love the place.
4
We had a quick snack here at Satay by the Bay, it is a nice calm location and generally nice. The BBQ stingray was nice and still juicy, not too dry. The portion was a little smaller than I remember but still convenient place to have Singaporean food after a visit to the Gardens by the Bay. About 10 minute walk from the domes
3
This Food court is one of the three main food courts in Singapore where traditional satays are well represented. The other two food courts are Lau Pa Sat and Makansutra Gluttons Bay. Choices and seating availability are less than Lau Pa Sat. Seating availability is comparable with Makansutra Gluttons Bay but choices of satays are definitely greater at Satay by the bay.In general the food is acceptable and it has a nice location which makes it worth going there. However the food is lacking traditionality and authenticity. Also seating availability can be a big challenge, especially in the evening. Several food courts are available and several dishes have to be ordered at several different food stands. Having some wet towels with you to clean the hands afterwards is very convenient. Personally I've tried the satay's from City Satay. I wasn't really surprised but I enjoyed having some food early afternoon at a nice a calm location.Having eaten so many satays at Singapore I wouldn't recommend this location for dinner. Lau Pa Sat has much more choices, seating availability, value for money and Singaporean authenticity if you can wait until 7pm. Satay by the bay however is still preferable to Makansutra Gluttons bay
3
I remember the original Satay Club and this only has the name in common. The ambiance was unpleasant with smoke billowing out of the multiple satay grills around the place and making it hard to breathe. The food was average and with so many places to choose from, this didn't offer anything of distinction. The satay meat (chicken, lamb, beef) was over-tenderized and the peanut sauce lacked ingenuity. While it is a convenient spot for picking up a quick meal at Garden by the Bay, a shorter walk in the opposite direction will also yield a better meal and overall experience
4
be prepared to wait nearly 30 mins for your food on weekends. super packed on weekends, even though we arrived early ard 6pm, maybe because it is school holidays. love the chicken wings
4
If you are hungry after a visit to Gardens by the Bay this is the best place to have a meal. There are a lot of Satay stalls selling Chicken and Mutton Satay as well as other stalls selling favorite SIngaporean favorites. It is also Al Fresco (Fresh air) from the breeze from the Bay. Food prices are a bit expensive but you dont have to walk far from Gardens by the Bay to have your favorite meal
4
very good food and lots of different places to buy it. Bit tricky finding a seat, and then keeping it, especially if there are only two of you and you want to go looking for food together. But people are friendly and honest in Singapore, so not too risky to leave a bag on the table or ask the neighbouring table to keep an eye on your things. Good beer and very pleasant and impressive views as the sun sets (park and sky-scrapers). Good value too, but be prepared for a longish wait for a taxi home
3
We had been hearing about this place and decided to go as a family for dinner. We arrived just before it got dark and the parking lot was already full. Why do Singapore eating establishments always provide insufficient parking? Quite annoying when I have to wait 10 minutes for parking in a place like this. The place is al fresco like a food court but in nice surroundings. There is a very large selection of food stalls. As with many food courts, there are insufficient tables and seating during weekends and evening mealtimes! Took us 15 minutes to find an available table and another 5 minutes for it to be cleaned. The satay is very average yet overpriced, so I think tourists may be their target customers rather than locals. Overall a nice place spoilt by poor planning and execution. Highly unlikely to return anytime soon
4
Satay is cooked to aromatic chewy perfection..love the peanut gravy, not too spicy for the kids.The open seating is a really fun way for the kids to eat while enjoying the ambience of the Marina Bay Gardens.Come for an early dinner to avoid the mad carpark woe
4
My family and I came here for dinner after a long day at the two conservatories. It's about a 7-10 minute walk after exiting the two domes. The food was good, although a bit overpriced. The place gets crowded very early, so nab a seat early! Try the satay stall that serves pork satay, no regrets! The prata stall was also very good; my parents loved it
3
Visited this place on 23 Dec afternoon for lunch with family.We tried some of the local delicacies such as satay and laksa. Both are not good. I think the taste has been altered to suit the tourist taste bud e.g. not spicy (chilli) at all and more towards the sweet side. If your visit is to try out good Singapore food, I would recommend going to our neighbourhood hawker centre or coffeeshop, the food will taste much much better at a 40% lower the cost.However, if you are looking for a good steamboat dinner and hang out with friends, then this place will be a good choice.Baby/child seats are available at this place
4
Satay by the Bay is just a 10 mins walk from Garden by the Bay, it is a eating place that have many stalls selling different food. Seafood BBQ steamboat is just one of the stalls that you can enjoy both BBQ & steamboat together and it is a buffet style. I went there with my family last Sunday & just paid $27 per person. All the seafood & vegetables are fresh & we really enjoy ourselves. There are lots of vegetables to choose from & their seafood is always refill instantly by their staff when it is almost empty. As it is a buffet style you can eat as much as you can but do take note there is a charge of $5 per 100g if you take the food but did not consume. As this area is without aircon be prepare to sweat a lot
2
Sad to see such a great location tarnished by cost cutting, over priced food stalls. Rental must be tremendously high for stall owners to embark on given average food at hyped up prices. Sure the environment and ambience is good (else would have been rated 'terrible') but to compare this location with the defunct Satay Club of old, is a travesty. Do not normally give such ratings, however this would be the first as the place has gone from "acceptable" to "just not worth the trip". Won't name any stalls as each person has their own threshold. So please visit the place and form own opinions
3
Was there 20/12/2015 eveningOrdered satay pork and pork belly - delicious , hokkien mee - good, chicken wings - average, popiah - give it a miss. You have to queue (average waiting time 20 to 35mins) and the food is expensive. You will also have to wait for a table (average waiting time 20 to 30mins.)Bring a spare shirt cos u will smell of barbeque meat after eating here
4
Lots of food to choose from. Best time to eat there is at night as the would be definitely warm during the the day. The only downside is that the smell of satay and grilled food sticking to your clothes.
5
Many kind of food , bbq seafoods, chicken wings , satay and local food , all are very tasty , can buy and share many kind of food to your friends and family , is good place to go .
4
eatting at nite time is great
there is no taxi at nite, although they provided taxi mobile number at taxi stand
but no one will pick the phone
is better to drive or walk to mrt
3
Sir Geylang Sate is nice! We bought the satay set, 15 sticks of chicken satay, 15 sticks of mutton/beef satay and 15 sticks of prawns.
Note: do no come on weekdays lunch time. Most of the stalls open during dinner time for weekdays.
3
The food here are ok. You can getting better one at other food centre. But I will eat here only when I am a local tourist in the area n didn't want to move farther. So please expect tourist spot pricing. The rental is expensive here
2
The food here are just good to see only. Not the real Singapore taste at all and the price is terrible. Super over rated. If you are in this area, I rather you go over to MBS foodcourt or Lau Pa Sat to eat. Way better food there
4
Hawker Centers can be intimidating for families. This one not so. Every kind of food imaginable. Yes more expensive than pure local food but still very cheap in the scheme of Singapore. Grab a dinner at catch the laser light show a gardens by the Bay in the super tree grove. 2 shows every night and it's free! Singapore at its best
3
Located close to Gardens by the Bay, which is one of my fav places in Singapore, it is an excellent ambience. The food though is much like what you can find in other hawker centers, not bad, but not super great either. It is more pricey though than other hawker centers. So I'll still eat there if I want to go to the Gardens, but I won't travel there just for the food.
4
Amazing yummy Satay - really tender, well flavoured and with a sauce that you could just have had on its own.We had a couples set for 14 SGD which included 10 chicken sticks and then we chose 10 beef sticks - you could also choose mutton - this came with red onion and cucumber chunks. We added 2 rice cakes at 1 SGD each.You tell them which table you are sitting at and pay and when your order is ready they bring it over to you We also got from a plate of Houmous and freshly made bread - baked in front of us - for 8 SGD from a nearby stall and a couple of drinks from another.The food was amazing and cheap - it made a nice break after seeing the Gardens by the bay light show and visiting the rest of the comple
4
We always go to the Satay by the Bay or The Satay Club as previously known. There is such a range of food there these days but you can't beat the Satays. Chicken, Pork and Beef or King Prawn Satay sticks are served with beautiful aromatic peanut sauce, cucumber and Spanish onion slices and steamed rice. There are plenty of bars and ice-cream vendors and the prices are great when you are feeding a family. Keep the traditions going by visiting the Satay by the Bay for a feed
5
A little pricey but good range of food choices on offer. Location by the sea is truly inspiring and beautiful! Food is tasty and together makes for a memorable evening out. Try to catch the free lights show afterwards by supertrees, around 8pm
3
Dinner with friends... Orders several dishes and hey we're all local.... Taste was a little below the acceptable standard for the price you have to pay.... If I would choose I would not go bk.
5
We stopped for lunch, it was a great spot because there were so many options. We tried Singapore's famous chili crab with fried rice and of course some Tiger beer.
5
Great Satay everywhere, lots of 'deals' so look out for them, get a 'Tower' of Tiger, 13 half pints or 7.5 pints of your best Tiger, which you serve yourself from a tap
4
This place has an amazing array of food and drinks at very reasonable prices. It was also a lot cleaner than other hawker centres that we visited. You could get a scoop of ice cream in a cup for $1 and the same price for a soft drink. We visited this place twice as it is so convenient located near the Marina Barrage and the Gardens by the Bay
5
My husband and I often cycle to Satay by the Bay because it is a lovely cycle (or walk!) through the Garden by the Bay East across the river.We enjoy getting a fresh squeezed juice in the mornings or a pitcher of beer in the evenings. It isn't too crowded and you can always get a seat. There is a wide variety of food to choose from and we enjoy the atmosphere. There are public sinks available which is unusual for a hawker Centre. We will continue to go back and highly recommend it for any type of family
5
just $0.70 per satay stick (minimum purchase of 10 - but they are so yummy you would be silly to purchase any less) served with a LARGE serving of satay to dip these in. I will be back for you. Fabulous friendly staff, Number 7&8 rated as THE BEST SATAY with a bit of a kick. But you have to visit the little man with no teeth at NUMBER 6 - hilarious guy and the satay wasn't as spicy
5
This was a stop between the flower gardens and the light show at the gardens by the bay. Many different satay stalls to choose from. We had a massive pile of assorted skewers and some Thai fish cakes. Probably not as cheap as we expected but still cheap by Singapore standards and really good. Would go back gain
4
We enjoy bringing our visitors to Gardens by the bay and have our dinner at this tourist hawker center. For a unique experience eat at Wholly Crab and order a seafood bucket. Be prepared to use your fingers and to get messy - bibs are provided and not just for the kids :-
4
This is one of my favorite hawker center in Singapore because it is located on my favorite attraction, Gardens by the Bay. I already knew that this is not the typical hawker center with affordable foods. So I'm not that excited going to this place. But after the tiring garden exploration that we had, I really need to refresh and fill-up my stomach.It is located near the Children's garden. We went here around 2pm to have late lunch. Most of the stall offer expensive seafood dish. So we roam around and look for affordable food experience. I tried one stall offering Indian food and ordered Chicken Biryani. The serving is very generous. I was surprised that it was just a single order. I love the rice they used but it made my stomach full just by finishing a half of the serving. The sauce was spread all over the rice which I don't like. If you're not a fan of Indian food, you should inform them to not spread the sauce all over your meal. The veggies included with the meal is good.We also tried Satay! If you visited this place, do not forget to order Satay! Its delicious!!! Its just barbecue but for me its very tasty compare to other local barbecue here in my country. Try it! We saw a poster of a dessert promo here. I forgot the name of the dessert but its crushed ice with red beans, jellies, etc. its delicious and very affordable
4
3 of us ordered about 45 beef skewers. Really delicious! Dinner was only about $30 - highly recommend! Each order comes with sliced onions and cucumbers. Also, peanut dipping sauce. We ordered rice - don't recommend the rice....gelatinous and cold. Everything else was great!!
4
Very busy cosmopolitan place. Food freshly cooked you are given a pager which tells you when it is ready. Large area with loads of variety and there is a bar but only serves beer. Very cheap well worth the visit.
5
We had visited this place on a previous visit but as we had returned with friends, decided on a meal here. We shared some satay and then individually chose our own mains from the many different choices. Also convenient to eat before or after the gardens light show - recommend a visit
1
if you really want a Singapore food experience, skip this. It is expensive, and food tastes bad. There are a lot of other food options around and i'm skeptical of the stallholder's survival. Well, it may be a little inconvenient, but definitely much better than Satay by the Bay, One of the more accessible hawker would be : Old Kallang Airport Hawker (accessible by Mountbatten MRT) where you can get grilled seafood, chilli crab, satay, fried kuay teow, chicken rice, hokkien seafood noodles, carrot cake, prawn noodle soup. basically everything you can get at Satay by the Bay and more. It can get a little chaotic, but its where most locals are. It will be worthwhile and truly authentic experience.
4
Backed for a couple of days, top of the list of food to eat was satay and so here I was chomping down chicken, beef and mutton satay plus ketupat (rice cakes) with spicy peanut gravy. Delicious of course! Added with cockles, stingray with sambal (Chilli) paste and Kailan with oyster sauce just completes my meal. You could get satay at Lau Pa Sat too but here, you could walk around after a heavy meal to the Marina Barage to watch people cycling, jogging or kite flying. Crowded on weekends with families. Will come back again when I'm back!
4
I had feared that within the vicinity of the Gardens by the Bay there would not be decent food at reasonable prices around, but Satay proved me wrong. While it is not as cheap (or as good) as the more authentic makan that the locals frequent, the food we had was pretty good (several satay and a laksa) and not that expensive. I even found a veggie only dish at an Indian stall, which was a very nice addition.
3
We were at Gardens at The Bay and was having dinner at Satay By the Bay. It is not easy to find. Walking quite a distance before finding the place. I was expecting something more spectacular. Was a bit disappointed as the place is like an ordinary hawker center found everywhere in singapore. There are only 4 satay hawkers selling satay. Food is ok and not fantastic. Price is expensiv
5
Arrived here prior to browsing gardens by the bay at night. I must say satay power 6 absolutely beautiful and cheap. That charred taste that we didn't get from any other stall. Have been back since the first time and was worth the trip out just for their food
5
I love Satay by the Bay! For starters, you'll find the most popular dishes in Singapore like Chicken Rice, Hokkien Mee, BBQ Chicken Wings and as the name suggests...satay! Best of all, the prices are very reasonable. That's hard to find in Singapore yet alone at a tourist attraction.My must have is the BBQ Buffet. The price is decent for a buffet that has delights such as bamboo clam, crabs, scallops and an assortment of meat. Non-pork eaters will be delighted to know that it's pork free.And yes, the ambience at Satay by the Bay is amazing
4
If you are around Marina bay, then you should try this place for some great satay and asian street food. You will get varieties of satay along with other types of Asian street food. There are not many stalls.. and I would recommend this place only if you are around marina bay. Else I suggest you try Newton Food center. Its around 15 mins walk from Marina Bay Sands Skypark but a long walk if you are around or near Merlion... so be aware of the distance
4
What a great experience this is well worth a visit for either two people or the whole family, plenty of options for style and type of food
5
So good! Ordered mutton, beef, chicken, prawn, rice and beer. No problems finding a table, clean environment and food ready quickluly. Paid our very reasonable bill and devoured it. Would definitely go again.
5
Plenty of seafood hawkers. Satay is also available day. Dine in by the bay with fantastic view with flyers and marina bay sands at the back. Good food.
5
Good food have to wait long. my favorite over there are satay and BBQ prawn. will call street food place at its best. thumbs up!
4
Was surprised at the variety of food sold. Had satay, seafood spread and fried chicken wings. They were all superb. Price was average, nothing on the highside. The place was clean and it was not stuffy.
4
If you have never eaten satay, then you should definitely go here, though it is quite a walk from anything, so make sure you are up for a good sweat! There are several satay places to choose from as well as other eating choices. Back in the day, the satay club was outdoors and men cooked the sticks over a fire using palm leaves to fan the flames. Watching someone cook them over an electric grill certainly is less interesting, though they tasted good
4
My wife and I spent a few hours in Gardens by the Bay during daylight hours, ending up (after visiting the two domes and the super trees) at Satay by the Bay (deliberately on purpose!!!) A few satays and cold beers later, we walked back through the now dark Gardens with the super trees and lanterns all lit up (very well planned!) The food, service and amenity at Satay by the Bay was good, with a good mix of locals and expats alike. A little out of the way as a singular destination, but a great local style break to our trip to the Gardens..
5
After watching the sound and light show in the Supertree grove we decided to try Satay by the Bay for dinner. There is a good variety of food on offer. We had satay sticks which were great value (10 for $7) and some of the best satay sauce I have ever tasted. Also had BBQ chicken wings which were juicy and tasty.It's a nice location in the gardens and not a tourist rip off at all.Very impressed and would recommend if you want to try hawker food in a nice open setting
4
Discovered this satay stop when walking through Gardens By the Bay. A great, open air, outdoor food hall with plenty of satay stands as well as stands offering other local dishes. Really enjoyed the outdoor setting with the view over the water, along with the tasty satay off course. Good value at 10 satay sticks for $7, or try some of the deals if you need more food. Family friendly too. About a 15-20 minute walk from the Marina Bay Mall
4
There is a wide variety of food sold here, definitely not just satay. The place is not air conditioned and consists of many stalls selling their food, from steamboat buffet to seafood delicacies, of course the satay stalls. A hawker center by the Bay with a great waterfront, this makes for a good dining option if you are in the area, apart from all the restaurants around
5
Yummo only wished I had of ordered more as we didn't manage to get back to visit again. The satay sticks and sauces on offer were so tasty, only disappointing that the only alcoholic beverages on offer seemed to be beer.
5
We tried the Prawns & Pork Satay skewers then came back later for the Chicken & more Prawns.I believe this was the exact same satay recipe I had nearly 50 years ago when I originally visited Singapore. On other return visits I tried the Satay in Chinatown, none were as good as this current one at Satay by the Bay.Thoroughly recommended for Satay lovers
5
I initially thought this place was a tourist trap, but since we visited the nearby Gardens, we dropped by to check it out. Perhaps it was due to hazy conditions but the place wasn't crowded and pretty breezy. We didn't eat any Satay but had BBQ Chicken wings at SGD1.50 each which are always a staple and pretty yummy. We had BBQ Sambal stingray and food from wholly crab. Erdinger beer on tap was SGD16 per pint. Worth a second visit!
5
We came here in the evening after wandering around Gardens by the Bay (before the light and sound show). We were expecting it to be more expensive than local hawker centres, but really the prices were quite similar. The outdoor atmosphere right next to the water is really lovely, and the satay stalls are good fun to watch. We ate at Satay Power (the same stall that is at La Pau Sat) and a restaurant called Makan something. The aunty at the Makan restaurant was very helpful and honest! We had already ordered lots of satay but wanted to try salted egg yolk crab, but not wanting to pay so much or have too much food. She suggested that she could use crayfish instead, for about a third of the price, and still tasty. We did so and very glad she made the suggestion! Very friendly stall owners and they are not out to rip tourists off. Great for couples or families
4
the location was near the sea and the food was great you have a lot of option to choose from seafood to their best seller satay food, it is a pork in barbecue. Try also their chili frog. it is nice and good to eat with a bottle of beer
4
Was in the area late at night and was craving for Indian food. Couldn't think of any immediate location with the right choice and decided to have a shot here and Mi-oh-Mi did I make the right choice.Talking about the old taste of crispy prata with thick curry gravy to go with, I have not tasted anything like the good old days for a very long time. Not even at some of the more popular venues on the island for the same dish.It was especially entertaining to watch the master at work, when he carefully treated each dough, flipping and spreading it out evenly and the additional work he put in for a "plaster", when you incidentally poked into it and met the egg yolk, it flows out to form a golden river of goodness.Many would have overcooked this part to compromise for quicker serving time.A definite MUST TRY
5
We were looking for what I remembered as the satay club and were recommended this place. Turned out to be one of the best meals we had on our visit to Singapore. Don't be put off by the appearance of the food centre, I naturally find these places to be dirty and the people who work here to be rude, however, head for one of the satay stalls on the outside and fill your boots.The meal was delicious and fresh, and the satay some of the best I have ever had. I will definitely come back next time I visit Singapore.One thing to be aware of is if you try and use public transport to get there it is hard, and not well signposted, we ended up getting a taxi from the MRT station as we found it just too hard to find
4
If you want to try hawker food but have been put off by unsanitary conditions at other locations, this is the place to try. It's like a food court -- clean, organised and not overwhelming -- but offers hawker food stalls selling satays, Chinese, Indian, and various other cuisines. Yes, prices are a tad higher.....but the food is a little better too
3
Satay By The Bay is a fun place for eating out. Loads of life going on by the tables and quite a variety of food to choose from - Turkish, Thai, Malay, Singaporean of course, seafood and of course different kind of satays. This is a foodcourt type of restaurant so it's self-service. We were 4 persons sharing 5 different meals. I would give 4 stars for the experience but since the food was a bit lame to my taste, I only give 3 stars
4
I love Satay's and the peanut sauce that is so readily available in this part of the world so for me, there are some serious expectations and I can say the place delivered. The satay's were every bit as good as I had hoped for and I am reliably informed from the rest of the group that other food and other vendors were equally doing themselves justice. It is a Hawker's market, albeit in a more open, serene setting. Well worth a visit and the perfect accompaniment to a night time stroll through the Gardens By The Bay and Supertree Grove. We dined earlier in the evening due to the younger members of the group, so crowds and securing a table wasn't an issue for us. Well worth a visit and tying it in to a cooler night time strol
4
We ate here before watching the Light Show. The food was good and cheap. It is hard to get a table as it is a very popular place. Plenty of variety and nice cool breeze as it is near the water.
4
Great experience, reminds me of 15 years ago, Hawker style fair, cost effective and clear, great variety.
5
another great way to enjoy Gardens by the bay in the evenings. So fun to be out there to feel the local ambiance of Singapore. You need to drive so you should ask your local friend for a ride.
1
We decided to pay this place a visit after hearing so much about the ambience and atmosphere. Not there for the food but we just have to try once. Ordered satay from City Satay, chicken wings, popiah, fried hokkien mee and a sugar cane juice. Entire meal cost us about 40bucks but quality is really not there. However having said that, it's a nice place for tourists to get exposed to the different flavours of Singapore. One will get a better meal anytime out in some coffeeshop at a fraction of the price but in terms of atmosphere, it's brings on a whole new dining experience
3
This is a typical hawker's place - the difference is that it is by the scenic Marina Bay. The food being offered here is nothing different from other hawkers and the prices are are bit higher but still acceptable.It's hard to find a table for a big group on peak hours so one has to literally wait near diners who are about to finish. Some orders take some time due to the number of diners but you can order from different outlets (for example, order rice from the not-so-busy outlets).Compare the prices of the hawkers as some offer packages that save you money. The satays are good but the barbecue wings were way below in taste from the ones at Gluttons Bay.After dinner, take a stroll along the garden for a nice nightcap
3
Been here twice. First time I was here I had prawn, chicken, lamb and beef satay and they were good. Since this is a tourist spot, dishes here are more expensive compared to the local hawker centers you can find in other places. Makansutra, Newton Food Circle and Satay by the Bay are of same level when it comes to prices as all of them are tourist spots. There are other hawker centers serving the same dishes but are quite cheaper than what they offer
4
Affordable local food scene with a nice breezy environment next to the sea. Serves all the local delights like satay, grilled stingray with spice sauce etc with a good variety of beers at affordable prices. Has the live screening of English premier league matches for free as well. Ample parking and easy to get a taxi as well
4
I've visited Satay by bay back in 2013 and again in 2015. There are a variety of stalls you can choose from and sky is the limit when you order. Our favorite stall would have to be Makan by the Bay, it's the stall with the green plates (each stall have different colored plates to determine which plate belongs to which stall). The products are so fresh, despite the long lines, the food is worth the wait. We mostly order cereal prawn, sambal stingray, shrimp fried rice, and ofcourse Satay. Tip: best time to visit Satay by the bay is on weekdays. Friday to Sundays the hawker stalls are jam packed! So be there by 6 if you want to have a place to sit.
3
City Satay is a definite must-order. Order your seafood from Marina Live Seafood. The ones from Boon Tat Street Seafood was terrible as some of the dishes were not fresh. We know because we are locals and we have been eating such seafood from many places. And service from Boon Tat was poor. If you want to eat the Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodles, go to the stall behind Marina Live Seafood. The queue is long, but it is worth the wait as the chef puts in his best effort in ensuring that the noodles are properly infused with the prawn soup base. Very tasty
4
We had seen the reviews of this place before visiting Singapore and it was on the top of the list for when we visited the Gardens by the Bay. It was an interesting first hawker experience for us. As others have stated there is much to chose from and all of it looked so appealing.We started our food journey here with a mixture of freshly cooked satay sticks - wonderful flavours. We tried the stingray from another stall - again a tasty first time dish for me - I had more later elsewhere. A few Tiger beers helped to wash it down. I would recommend this place - seems very popular
5
Another street food place at its best. They Satay's are great not to mention the rest of the choices from seafood to curries. The seafood is fresh and the beer cold. Cheap eats at its best
3
Satay has many stalls set out in a hawker centre style prices were ok but higher than you would expect from a hawker centre. Food however cannot complain about all cooked well and enjoyable would go back for sure.
4
As you go from stall to stall you realise you cannot possibly eat every offering from the numerous stalls as there is too much to choose from- Seafood, kebabs, numerous satay stalls and vietnamese and an Indian as well as fruit juice stalls and a beer stall. Funnily enough the beer and ale bar served the best food of the night - Deep fried chicken wings - that we had with a jug of Tiger ($22.50) while we tried to work out what we wanted. In the end we opted for a mix of beef chicken and prawn mix satays with rice ($20 )- The rice in green wrappings is just steamed rice and is not very tasty - but with the mix of noodle soup and the BBQ chicken wings we had ample to eat. We enjoyed it but I must be honest - we thjought the hawker stalls in China Town were much better- but when visiting Gardens by the Bay this is the place to grab a bite to eat- Not cheap eats - quite expensive compared to other places
4
This was a fab experience, with a buzzing atmosphere, but is not for the faint hearted. It is designed as a food court, with a huge variety of stalls from satay, bucket of chilli crab to pizza. It takes time to navigate the stalls and then decide what everyone wants, so don't be afraid to browse first. We all went to different stalls and got just what we wanted. We didn't realise that groups of tables were for specific vendors, but no one moved us on and took our presence with good humour. The food is a little pricy compared to other meals we have had, but the atmosphere and location are more than worth it. After our meal we wandered along the sea front, took in the garden by the bay, watched fireworks and the light n lazer show at super tree grove. Great nigh
5
There is a huge selection of food here, but we had a bucket of seafood that fed the two of us for $60 and it was delicious. You pick the type of sauce you want and side/s.They cover the table in plastic and tip the seafood onto it. When you have finished they just pick it all up and dispose including the plastic tablecloth. It was the best meal we had in Singapore
2
The food: Quiet expensive though, we spend $30 for a satay meal which barely feed 3 of us. For the same cost in other place we would be ultra full or really delicious food. Average.The crowd: We waited 30 minutes for food. I came here with my grandma who is 80 years old so it is not pleasant at all.The service: We are 9 people so we came in try to look for space but it was crowded, then a lady quickly dragged us to their table, which was in the middle of the food court and open space. We thought it is just a table that you can bring the food you bought there to eat. So three of us had their food and other find other things to eat. When we leave, she tried to charge us $30 for the table because we "did not eat with them". Personally, I have worked in food service so I understand her feeling, but $30 is quiet greedy and nasty. We ended up giving her $10. Food: 3.5/5Space: 3.5/5Service:1.5/5Don't bother much, there is better satay, better service, better atmosphere in Singapor
1
'Cui' is the singlish word for rubbish and 'Marina live seafood and steamboat' unfortunately represents quite possibly the worst in hawker fare or 'zhi char' (at least for some foods). My friends and I ordered the lala, sambal kangkong, satay and salted egg squid. The food was pricey and the lala was absolutely horrid; the very definition of unfresh and at least 30ï¼… were unopened. The salted egg squid was also not fresh and rubbery. The only saving grace was perhaps the kangkong and satay but there are places which serve better tasting versions. All in all, not recommended
3
You pay less for the same food elsewhere than here. You really pay for its location next to the Garden by the Bay. Example, a glass of sugar cane costs at most $1.50 at another food centre or food court. Here you pay $3 per glass. A combo of 6 BBQ wings and 6 BBQ prawns can set you back by $22.00. Friday and weekend evenings pose challenges in getting seats, although there are ample car parking lots. Will not come back
4
Whilst visiting Gardens by the Bay, my sister and I visited Satay By The Bay for lunch.We shared 10 beef satay sticks and 10 chicken satay sticks (S$13), rice (S$2), and my sister had a Tiger beer (S$5) and I had a watermelon juice (S$2.40). All was delicious.As the satay sticks were quite small, we didn't feel unpleasantly full and were very happy when we came across a stall selling coconut ice cream. A large scoop on a cone cost just S$1.50 and it rounded off the meal nicely.All in all it was a good value, pleasant meal.
5
We were staying at the Marina Bay Sands, and wondered into the beautiful gardens, searching for some 'local' authentic food, like from the days of the Satay Club, car park by day, Satay club by night! We were not disappointed! Delicious food, the old style food hawkers, with naturally a Singha to wash it all down! The Gardens close around nine, so one has to be in early, but definitely worth the walk! Beautifully lit gardens by night, a very pleasant experience!
4
A good little food centre in the middle of Gardens by the Bay. Had BBQ Stingray and satay, which were both pretty good. the only thing that lets in down is the location of it in the park.
4
Variety of food. Seafood to western to steamboat to satay. Love the lime juice as it is blended. Super refreshing for hot country like SG,
4
Ate about 9.30 in the evening when it was starting to quiet down. A bit too neon for me. Food though was pretty good though price on the steep side. Lots and lots of fish. Nice atmosphere
3
There are many satay stalls and local food stalls selling seafood and hawker food. The price is higher if compare to other hawker center, but it is conveniently located (3-5mins walk from cloud forest) for tourist after visiting Garden by The Bay. It's open air with nice water front view
5
Great spot to enjoy some local food from the fresh satay (always buy more than you think as they are small), the partha and mrtabuk in particular was really good. Hawker stall style food not the cheapest in Singapore but nothing around the bay area is cheap. Stay and watch the light show at the gardens area or pop over to the shops and watch the lazer show. All Family friendly and easy to walk around
3
Lots of different stalls selling all sorts, chicken rice, chilli crab, frog porridge, yes really! and of course, stay by the truckload. It was very busy, noisy but not quite as cheap as other hawker centres, probably because it was in The Gardens by the Bay. Quite fun to visit though and sit on the tiny stools without falling off
4
A tasty Singaporean delicacy, the chilli crab at Marina Bay Sands, was delicious. There are numerous restaurants in the hawker centre, we ate at the marina bay, seafood and steamboat. Very fresh, the buns which came with the chilli crab were like little donuts and very soft, and the kids liked the satay sticks. We also bought the Singaporean dish, chicken rice and popis at another stall (As it was not available from marina bay seafood and steamboat.) it was clean and pleasant. it's an easy walk from gardens by the bay so worth going for a reasonably priced feed before or after having a look in that area. The light show at gardens by the bay was fantastic. Kids and adults enjoyed it
4
like :- location and food. dislike :- over-crowded and stuffy at times. should have more better seating arrangements
4
Satay By The Bay is tuck in the Gardens By The Bay and not easily access by public transport. You have to walk about 10 minutes from the nearest MRT Station, Bayfront station situated at Marina Bay Sands. But for those who like to have a short stroll through the scenic Gardens by The Bay it will be worthwhile.The food quality at Satay by The Bay is only average since the main attraction, Satay from both Muslim and non Muslim types are a big disappointment maybe it's due to the bulk of the Satay they have to prepare and hence standard is compromised. You can find far better Satay in some other smaller satay stalls in Singapore.Variety of food is diverse and you can order from any Chinese, Malay, Indian, Western, seafood stalls in the spacious indoor dining space. Be prepared for the crowd especially on the weekend
4
Inconvenient location for people who aren't fond of walking. But Satay and Prata are pretty good. For people who want to save money and love the view of gardens and the sea
3
Had lunch here but have to say it was not my best experience. Low price but not the best quality for Singapore.
3
We had dinner there recently. Food wise ok but nice atmosphere.
Love the location and the gardens. Enjoy :)
4
had a nice dinner here. The food stalls sell good food. We tried satay, tom yam soup, giant cray fish, kebab, and all taste delicious. A good place to eat. Would love to go there again someday.
3
Set amongst the pristine Gardens by the Bay and with a plethora of choices in cuisine this is a must visit when in Singapore. I personally found the BBQ Stingray and Satay Chicken Skewers accompanied by a Tiger Beer.
4
We had dinner and enjoyed it. The location is inconvenient but the center is worth visiting anyway. Getting there in a taxi is no problem but leaving is difficult because at night there are few or no taxis - in fact, when we arrived our taxi driver warned us it would be difficult and that we should note the telephone number for the taxi company. When we were ready to leave (about 11:00pm) we were told that we could phone for a taxi and the waiting time would be around 15-20 minutes, which seemed too long so we walked to the Marina Bay Sands hotel as there would certainly be taxis there.I am surprised by the negative comments from some reviewers. True, this is not one of the best hawker centers in Singapore. True also that the name Satay By The Bay is misleading because there is much more than just satay stalls. However, the quality of what we ate was pretty good - better than some of the negative reviews would suggest. We enjoyed satay, otah, prawns, carrot cake, onion prata, and all were good.For the satay we tried examples from two different stalls for the fun of comparing between those two stalls and also with satay we had eaten in recent days at Newton Circus, Chinatown and Food Street (Smith Street). The chicken satay from Sri Geylang Sate Catering was the best we tasted of all the places we tried. Likewise the mutton satay, which was distinctly differently spiced from the other types of satay. We also tasted duck satay (not seen anywhere else) and belly pork. I discussed the satay sauce with one of the men working at Sri Geylang and was told that they make it themselves, which I can believe as theirs was noticeably different from other stalls: it had a darker color and a clearly richer and deeper flavor, and was really very nice. I have posted some photos of the Sri Geylang stall and recommend it.The otah is a mackerel paste cooked (grilled over the satay charcoal) in a banana leaf. We were told it would be spicy but cannot say it was particularly spicy; it was, however, different and quite enjoyable, without the usual pungency of mackerel. I would recommend visitors try it. At S$1 per piece and three for $2, it is difficult to go wrong.The onion prata was enjoyable, with distinct, clean taste, that made a nice complement to the satay. Fun to watch it being made.There is one stand selling draft beer. The prices are outrageous (a jug of Erdinger weissbier was S$33 (US$25) and even Tiger costs US$19 a jug; a jug giving about four mugs of beer), though drinks are generally too expensive in Singapore. The tower of beer looked fun, though only suitable if 4+ people are drinking, but at US$74 (S$99) a tower it is very expensive.The prices at Satay By The Bay are a bit more expensive than some of other places but the difference is not massive: a stick of satay at Newton Circus would be S$0.60 and here is S$0.70, which is not a material difference even over 20-30 sticks
1
As a proud Singaporean and a foodie, the QC of the food standards needs a serious check. It is appalling to serve such quality of food to tourists. It makes a mockery of our local cuisine. Even any hawker centre serves better satay than this venue. Everything is overrated not only on quality, taste & price. Try it at your own risk
3
Everything is just average. The only good food I tried there was pineapple fried rice. The BBQ chicken wing stall's staff have working attitude problem. The cleanliness need to be improved, a big number of birds flying toward uncleared tables to hunt for food. Scary
4
This place has become quite aFavorite for our family. We love the al-fresco dining and the section right by the bay with the little wooden bamboo stools and tables are a hit with our kids! No need for high chairs. Not to mention the kids could scoot around the bay while waiting for the satay to arrive.Place is generally kept very clean, though toilet cleaning could really be stepped upTry to arrive before 6pm. Parking and seats become really limited after 6pm, and people tend to hang around for a long time here so wait could be long. Watch for wind directions to ensure you are not sitting near the barbecue fumes which can be quite daunting
4
In fact, during our last trip there, we could hardly see satay on every table. Maybe 2-3 out of 10 tables would hold a puny plate of satays. Kinda like a novelty treat.It'll be more appropriate for it to be known as - Steamboat by the Bay.Steamboat options were quite substantial, from BBQ steamboat to Fish head curry steamboat and what nots. I am certainly not the steamboat person because I am lazy to cook, but this place I would go back again because of the spacious seating area and ample parking lots.Good for family outings and friends gathering
4
A long morning's walking around Marina Bay & Singapore Flyer & then around the Gardens. Arguing about where to eat & I had my way. Turned out to be a wonderful variety of cuisines in little stalls with a communal eating area, I suppose some people would call it a Food Court â€¦ We had fish and chips/egg prata with curry sauce/shrimp noodles & apparently the best crab my husband has EVER eaten!!! and a huge jug of beer, very welcome and necessary.We did NOT have the frog porrige. Someone has to draw the line
4
Great selection with something available for all foodie types. We had the satay skewers from two different vendors .... no noticeable difference in quality & loved the satay sauce! Would happily return if in the area again.
3
Tried Salted Egg Crabs at the stall named "B*** T..", cut throat price of $68 for a crab less than 1kg...The rest of the stalls..so so..
4
Don't miss this if you're in Gardens by the Bay. There are a lot of food stalls. Prices are very good, comparable to hawker prices.
5
We loved the satay ('Sri Geylang Sate' - first place on the left) and ordered a second round. Wasnt brave enough to order the prawn though just in case ;)
4
Had dinner there on the 5th of April. Tasty food and nice atmosphere. Love the location and the gardens.
Fresh, authentic and good value for money.
Enjoy:)
3
We went to have our dinner before going for musical.We ordered chicken wings (so-so), popiah (pretty acceptable), BBQ sting ray (surprising taste fine even it didn't look appealing), fried egg oysters (pretty acceptable) Price is really tourist pricing, but quality still acceptable. The only complaint we had was houseflies, for some reasons there were quite a few after us or rather our food. So we were busy trying to finish the food fast and escape from those flies.But we realized that those seated near the satay stalls, maybe due to the smokes, there wasn't any flies (I think).My friend's only complaint was her hair carried the satay smoke smell when we leave that location.For those who want to try some Singapore food, it maybe a good choice for varieties of local food at a tourist price.The toilets are pretty clean even though it's a tourist spot
5
The place is about 5 mins walk from the main Gardens by the bay area. I think the place only opens at night. It has a lot of satay booth. Price is kinda average.There are various stalls too, where one of it serves Chilli Crab and it cost you about $50. There is a taxi stand and numbers of taxis are available at the stand. So we can call the taxi directly, so no problem if you finish your dinner late night
4
Satay used to be everywhere in "old" Singapore. It's harder to find now. This place is the real deal. It's made fresh, it's cheap and it's a true Singapore experience. Naturally, you should see the Gardens by the Bay before or after coming here. If you need to escape the rain, come to this undercover area for a meal, a drink or a snack
3
After we toured the Gardens and Cloud Forest, we saw some signs pointing to this area a little further and in the direction of the ocean. It was about a 10-15 minute walk from the Cloud Forest along the canal. Keep watching for the signs. Once you find it, it will be on the lines of a hawker market. The two of us had Satays, about 15 pieces between both of us and as I recall it was about $15sgd. One of the stands serves fruit drinks and I had a sour sop drink that was so good that I had two of them. It was a nice spot to rest and restore our energy before walking back to the central part of the Gardens by the Ba
4
Whilst you are at Gardens By The Bay or even when it is closed there is a number of stalls selling Satay and many other food offerings. Admittedly it can be a bit of a walk to get there but the end product (Satay's) is worth the effort, anyway it will build up your appetite
5
If you feel hungry when visiting flower dome & cloud forest, you can fulfill your satisfaction here.. the food it good.. but the price is quite expensive.. but the drink is free, when you bring your own bottle and fill it with tap water... ^^
4
You won't feel stuffy as it's quite airy. Lots of varieties in local and international cuisines. The few grouses are the table and chairs were oily and certain stores services were not at par possibly we are just locals.
4
This was an outdoor covered hawker food market. Just lovely food. Lots of choices. Has a bar as well. We had freshly cooked satay plate while we waited. It was lovely. Great atmosphere and the stall holders friendly.
3
Food was so so as Singaporeans would say. Very nice location, good atmosphere, even for a Tuesday evening. Parking is 2c a minute. Lovely spot for an evening stroll.
4
We were looking for someplace halal to eat, and this place does have one! The seafood was simply amazing, and it was really good quality for the price. The stingray, we didn't like as much, but the crispy squid and black pepper crab were simply delicious, and we gobbled everything up! It's an outside food court sort of arrangement, and the nice breeze and giant fans whirling above helped in making it a nice experience. Definitely going back
4
Satay by the Bay is not really a restaurant, but more of a hawker centre set up. One good thing is that it is spacious and airy and if you come when there is light, you get a pretty good view of of the Barrage, the Singapore Eye and the river. In the evening there are people jogging along the promenade. There are a few satay stall, which are quite good. There are many other stalls if you don't like satays (but who don't?) Apart from satays, we had poh piahs, kuih pati, rojak, noddles and chandol. It was a good feed. No more expensive than the food courts in Ion and Takashimaya.Try to find tables not too near the satay stalls to avoid the smoke from the BBQs
4
It's basically a hawker centre and probably your cheapest option if you are visiting Gardens by the Bay.It's not only just sate. There are other choices too, in fact lots of other choices.It was quite full when I visited at 8.30pm on Sun night.I ordered sate from Sri Geylang Sate. Nice food, especially the peanut sauce.The whole place is a bit untidy, dirty and smoky for me, but Ok for a quick fill.I wouldn't go out of my way to visit if I wasn't visiting Gardens by the Bay
4
My Thai friend who has been living in Singapore over 10 years took me to this place and I really enjoyed it. There are plenty of food. I don't it was expensive or not because my friend paid hahaha. Anyway, I really want to be back again if I have chance to Singapore next time
4
We went here last saturday lunch time. Loverly sunny day, wasn't too busy but the food was excellent as ever. Over the years we have been to the different locations of the satay club but this was our first visit to satay by the bay. We then went for a walk in the gardens by the bay which are truely magnificant. Recomend to go for clasic singapore street food. particulay the chicken satay and peanut sauce......
3
When u visit Gardens By The Bay, this hawkers center is the closest , it offers a large choice of satay (mini brochettes) of pork, chicken, mutton, Australian beef. There's lots of seafood and BBQ, pizza too.Not too good but not bad too, if u have time, take a taxi to somewhere else. We were tired by walking all day in this Gardens so we decide to have dinner there. The view is great with the marina and we had the chance to watch a firework while eating
4
This place doesn't look like much when you first approach, its a clean shaded, ventilated, outdoor sitting area with basic plastic tables/chairs and almost 20 restaurants.
Local Singaporean food is served here (noodles, rice, satay, seafood)
The Chilli Crab is a must try!! 5 Stars
4
We combined this with the Marina Bay Sands deck as it is a lovely walk along the bay to get there. Food is great and cheap. Lots of locals eating there which is always a good sign.
2
Would not recommend my friends or family to visit the place. Price seems to be more expensive to compare with the portion of food being Served and the service is too slow.
5
after visiting the Cloud Dome we decided to eat.
Saw the signs to this place, and didn't expect much, but pleasantly surprised.
Good service, good selection, and good food.
We had pizza, satay, and wedges - all cheap, but tasty.
Would certainly return.
4
We enjoyed the food when we finally got it. The wait is very long because it is very crowded at dinner time due to visitors at Gardens by the bay. However, the satays are worth the wait. Have patience and enjoy.

Almost a Singaporean Hawker centre, this space provides a large range of different foods, including "satays". This is not posh eating, but DIY in an open space (with a roof): you order from the place you want and then go and collect it a few minutes later. Very low cost: two dishes (shared) and some simple drinks for well under S$20. Nothing unusual for Singaporeans, from what I gather, but an unusual approach for those from cooler climes. Be aware that this place is a little bit of a walk from the Visitor Centre, especially if it is very hot at the time, but well worth it. We used this place more than once (though never tried the "satays"), so recommend it for what it is

Popular among locals and tourists alike, this place has the best Singapore food--and its wide variety. It is affordable, to be enjoyed while siting outdoors with the sea breeze and with a superb view of MBS, Gardens by the bay and some of the Singapore skyline.Try the BBQ prawns! and as much of the seafood on offer
2
We went on a Sunday night so assume it's one of the busiest times. We were totally put off by the state of the food court - used dishes everywhere including on the seats and in the plants! The tables were dirty and no one seemed to be clearing tables - in the end we gave up
4
Went there for my birthday dinner with some of my friends. It was my first time to try it. It costs S$25 per head and you get limited amount of crab and big scallops. That's just to name a few. There are veggies, other seafood as well. I didn't like the glasses for the drinks though. Most of them were dirty. Good thing they changed it to plastic ones after a while. I will still come back to this place

This place is between Gardens-by-the-bay and Marina barrage. The views in daylight is splendid and in nightfall, the city lights illuminate the bay. There was a nice breeze when we visited. There many stalls serving up a diverse range of foods from international fare kebabs, pizzas, fish & chips; to local fare such as satay, BBQ stingray and chicken wings, fried prawn noodle and Bak kut teh (pork bone soup). Decent priced but not cheap. Food is average but this place does bring quite alot of the local fare under one roof. Access via MRT requires a 10-15 min walk
3
A collection of different kiosks under one roof. very average. Only place around to eat. Food is very edible. Skewers from the BBQ satay place are very tasty and decent priced. great for food on the go.
4
Satay by the bay is a great way to end the evening after the magical light show and tree top walk. It is a little walk from gardens by the bay but the choice of food, flavour and atmosphere is worth it.
4
It's a bustling place with lots of satay stalls. There are also stalls selling seafood, chicken rice, pizza, Indian food, etc, so there's no lack of variety. The place offers a good view of the marina area.
2
We had great expectations before going there , we were rather dissapointed.
The location is great but the seating average.
We ordered lamb & prawns satays : dry and tasteless...
Singapore has better options , avoid this place.
3
Good enuff for take-away drinks if you're walking in the area. Eat only if someone is really starving. The area around is great for casual family walks.
3
The food is only so-so, you can find much better in other areas such as Bugis. But the location is stupendous!
4
Ok, so a few of the stalls are halal. There's a turkish place, an indian place and a satay stall. Satays were cooked well, tasty and full of flavour. Delicious dip sauce too. Smallish portions, reasonably priced considering its in Marina Bay!Excellent for a snack after exploring the Gardens by the Bay, Cloud Forest, Flower Dome
4
it is a nice and popular place for an evening on the week -end. there is a wide range of stalls, with sea food with steamboat option that I find quite typical, also BBQ chicken satay, kebab, pizza and drinks. location is very close to the barrage. there is a ramp which allowed pedestrians to climb on top and from there you got a stunning view of the super tree from the garden by the bay, the marina bay sand, and the CBD
3
Contrary to the name of the place, Satay by the Bay does not only offer satay, there are other kinds of food stalls available as well.Ordered from Sri Geylang Sate, and had chicken, mutton, beef and duck satay. Nothing spectacular about the duck satay, and mutton satay was a bit tough. Did enjoy the chicken and beef satay though.Food arrived relatively quickly (5-10minutes for the duck and chicken, 25-30mins for the mutton and beef).Rated it average because better tasting satay can be found elsewhere in Singapore
4
Satay by the Bay is not a restaurant per se. It is a collection of vendors with a shared seating area. It is located on the edge of Gardens by the Bay, It is a pretty long, hot walk but the scenery was beautiful. In contrast to other reviewers, I was delighted by the earthiness of the area because we had just completed weeks of sterile hotels and a cruise ship.There are two satay stalls plus other types of food. Refreshing drinks and treats are also available
5
Great variety of food. Was really yummy! Area clean and tidy. Nice place to sit ,relax and enjoy the atmosphere.
5
Easy to select your food. What yo see is what you eat. Very fresh,reasonably priced. can try a bit of everything and try what singapore has best to offer. Food, food Food. Oops i forgot shopping!!!
3
Too far to walk easily. Poor choices and if you have seafood allergy - very difficult to find food free of seafood
1
I would have guessed this place to be anywhere in the world other than in Singapore. We went to Gardens by the Bay during Xmas week, and decided to try Satay by the Bay. First and foremost, it is really no better than going to a glorified hawker center. But as we were there, we decided to get a plate of satay. We have no particular complaint with the quality, other than the fact that it took almost 30 minutes to get it. However, when we tried to take a seat, we realized that there were literally mounds of dirty plates piled up all over the place. Never, in ten years of living in this beautiful and clean country have we ever seen such a filthy spectacle in any eating establishment, of any kind. The sink, where one can wash up after eating, was stopped up and overflowing. Even if one could say that there were many more people because of the holidays, I fault the management for not having enough cleaning staff to address this problem. One thing is for sure, we will never step foot in there again
4
Almost as good as Lau Pa Sat and if you are going to Gardens by the Bay - go later in the afternoon. Look at the domes then walk round and have some satay. Once it is dark, walk back and see the Supertree light show to music.Great experience and good food
3
Contrary to advertisement on TV and photo on website, it is a food court ambient with very smoky air. Food are mid range In taste. A thorough disappointment to bring oversea visitors with high expectation. If it is offering alternative location to Lau Pa Sat or Newton Circus, it is acceptable.
4
This is a covered, open air food court at one end of Gardens by the Bay. We walked here after visiting the Cloud Forest and Flower Domes, after an enormous storm passed. The walk is very pleasant in November with a good overcast, a breeze, and rain on the air. There is a good range of hawker centre dinner food. Satay, of course, in different varieties (Chinese and Malay). We also had fried chicken, sambal kang kong, and sambal ray. Magic
1
Ordered satays from SRI GEYLANG SATE and told the employee to send it to table 19.... after a while i shifted to table 16 and informed the same guy. He acknowledged it too and said no worries.But after almost 1 hour, i did not see any sign of the employee delivering satays. I went over to the same guy and he said that he tried to deliver it to table 16 and cannot find me anywhere. well HELLOOOO table 19 is just behind table 16. Moreover, i was sitting there all the time and i did not see anyone from their stall. Like.. a clear lie?After that he said that he will prioritize my order.. I waited there and guess what.. i saw that my order was skipped by few orders yet again.......... SUPER UPSET with the service.. Will definitely spread the words that this stall have bad service for sure
2
People who visit the Gardens by the Bay would come over here for a bite but I wouldn't recommend it as there are many more superior hawker centres in Singapore offering tastier local eats (skewers, chicken rice, noodles, etc.) at cheaper prices. It is also a bit of a walk from the Gardens but surrounds are lovely and the walk itself is enjoyable. If you are pressed for time and want to get a taste of the hawker centre it is not too bad as you get a good view
4
I had only the satay with the peanut sauce. The satay was freshly cooked to order, and the peanut sauce was tasty -- flavorful but not overpowering. A buzzing device notifies you when your dish is ready, so no need to stand around waiting. I was there for a late lunch. Some of the stalls were just opening up, and others hadn't opened yet. It's about 5-10 minutes walk from the Garden by the Sea's domes and the children's water park.This is a covered outdoor area. No air conditioning. No bugs when I was there -- no mosquitoes, no flies
4
Plenty of choice and went for the combination of prawns, chicken and lamb. They were delicious and the sauces were too.
5
Many food choices a little bit expensive from normal prices of food but you will enjoy the nice view...and food are great!
3
walked over to Satay by the Bay for lunch after a visit to the Gardens. As a food court/hawker type place it is a bit odd, being so far away from the streets but still, a good idea in the beautiful surroundings of the gardens. The toilets are especially lovely!! We ate decent satay at an OK price, although we ended up being stuck here for an extra hour by a huge thunderstorm. We had another drink and some pretty awful coffee, but were so impressed by the fabulous water features, bridges and gardens surrounding us. The wildlife was so close and plentiful. I would like to go back at night and see the place lit up. I think I would like to see perhaps a more upmarket lunch place to go along with the fabulous, spotless surroundings
4
This is a lovely little open air or half open air area which does the most delicious satays. A good selection to choose from and not overly expensive. Do remember to take plenty of kleenex with you as not good about giving out serviettes even though there is an area where you can wash your hands
3
I thought I won't be here until friends suggested to have dinner place. It is built within the compound of Garden By The Bay so the food here is not cheap. However, I did found that there also have some food at reasonable price. There are a lot of variety and I was surprised to see so much crowd at the food court. Our target was Satay and we tried 2 stalls. One Malay and one chinese. Apparently when the food served, by just looking at them, I immediately can tell which is the better one. Chinese one somehow like the one you bought in supermarket frozen section, especially the ketupak. The taste fail for me. Malay one tasted really much much better so based on this experience I know which one to look for next time.

My sister and I decided to go to satay by the bay as we have never been there before. We didnt know the way at all and accidentally caught the satay by the bay free shuttle bus at a bus stop near marina bay station. a little walking out to the bus stop. We thought there were public bus to the place and by sheer luck that the timing was right, the shuttle bus pulled up out of surprise, we happily got on the bus. The shuttle is every 30mins at various stop points. Food was ok and could be better. Reasoable prices averaging $6-8 per dish. From there, you can have a walk to the marina barrage and then walk all the way to bay front station. We actually walked to the esplanade. About 1.5hours stroll, enjoying the quiet moments and our chats. The place is a little out of place so if you dont drive, spare more time for travelling and dont hurry. Nothing negative but nothing special. Will go back again if we run out of chill out places. It only opens for dinner i believe and the free shuttle bus only runs in the evening
4
A bit of a walk from MBS but nice walk thru Gardens by the Bay along water to get here. There are a lot of options for food here but you have to come for the satay. Best to come in evening as it can be a very warm walk mid-day in the sun. No AC so if it's warm, be prepared to be moist.Really good satay flavors whether beef or chicken.Nice views of the water, but it faces away from the city so you get a different view
5
On visiting the Gardens we saw the sign for this places and decided to give it a go as we waited for the Garden Symphony. It was a little further to walk than we he planned in the heat but water beer and great Satay was well worth the walk. We also opted for the tiger prawns which were more tiger than I have ever come across in a prawn. Another good sign, we were chatting to locals who use the place...highly recommende
3
We had some great satay (flavour filled and tender) and other local Chinese dishes. It is located on the edge of the Gardens by the Bay near the flower domes and makes a great venue to eat at in the evening as you can later on stroll around the gardens and Marina Bay Sands. The only down side is that it's a fair walk from the nearest train station (Bay Front) and hard to find.
5
We decided to try it out as we were visiting Gardens by the Bay and we were not disappointed. Being westerners, street food in Asian countries is not something we typically try however, the cleanliness of the whole are meant we were keen to give this ago. It was some of the best Satay I have ever had and was very reasonably priced
4
Great food and bar available. Set in lovely gardens and ponds .. Make sure you put insect repellant on though.
4
Great place to spend afternoons and enjoy the various food and drinks from different countries. you may enjoy a walk by the bay while waiting for a vacant table or while your barbecues are being prepared.
5
Excellent food, priced similar to other food stalls in Singapore. Satay was tasty, even if the wait was a little long.
Seafood stalls also very good. Good choice of fruit drinks.
Highly recommended.
4
The satay stalls and outdoor "hawker centre" dining are typical of Singapore's eateries. The satay is good and the adjoining food centre also serves a large variety of local food.
3
We came across this place when visiting the Gardens by the Bay. Nice place if you prefer dining in garden environment. Food choices are however limited. Long queue for the chicken wings. The combo set at the satay stall are worth trying.
4
There were a range of little stands to choose a meal from. It is cheap and my meal was delicious. Although I didn't like that the guy put extra rice cakes on my plate that I didn't order and tried charge me more for them. But when I told him I didn't want them and he could take them back he let me keep them for free - so just try not to get fooled
4
We have been eating satay ( barbecue skewer meat with dipped sauce) all over Malaysia and other SouthEast Asian countries. We wanted to try Hainan satay which comes with peanut sauce with pineapple chunks. Later we found out one can sample different types of Satay at Satay by the bay at the Southern most of the Garden by the bay. The easiest way to get there is by bus or MRT followed by long but cosy walk in the evenning . The fragrant satay smell welcome you even before you could all the satay stalls. It is satay complex with many satay stalls ,drinks and cooked food outlet. We order traditional Geyland satay and skewer barbecue prawn and Hainanese satay, ice cold sugar cane with lemon and pineapple boat fried fried rice. The two Satays do taste different.Without prejudice we prefere the Geyland satay ! The chicken was well marinated and tastier peanut sauce. The sugar cane juice with lemon was perfect to quench your thirst as well soothe your palate if you find the sauce spicy. After the satisfactory meal it was a leisurely walk along the bay back to catch the bus. Along the way one could enjoy the colorful night scene of the surrounding buildings. One can watch the musical fountains over the Pedestrian bridge.It is an evenning well spent with satisfactory gastronomical rewards. I highly recommend satay lovers to visit this complex

My family and I were at Gardens by the Bay on a Friday evening. The gardens definitely offered plenty of spacious pockets for my two 6-yr olds to run around happily. Finally exhausted, they asked for dinner. We were at the main entrance and having looking at options, we decided to walk to Satay by the Bay (SB) which took us about 15 mins. SB is a typical Singapore style hawker centre/Food Court but prettier and cleaner, not surprisingly so. There were about 20 odd stalls there, many repeatedly offering satays, grilled prawns, BBQ seafood and Zi Char menu ie chilli crabs, belachan Kang kong, sweet sour pork etc. there was even a BBQ/steamboat buffet at $25 per adult, reminiscing the good old days of grilling heavily buttered cheap seafood and meat at Marina South. The satay was good, especially the pork belly, which u don't often find outside. They have packages too, 10 x normal satays + 2 pork belly + 2 grilled prawns for $15. It's not cheap but IMO, alright considering the location, ambience and options. A pretty good venue for some good Singapore fare all al fresco style.
4
We ordered satay from the satay stall. Very tempted by the seafood as well but as it was our 1st night in singapore we decided to play safe and eat something familiar. The sticks contained a good portion of meat and joy of joys no great big lumps of fat and gristle which often come on satay cooked by my local restaurants at home. The sauce was very tasty indeed...much oilier and spicier than I am familiar with but I liked it. There was a good choice of drinks and the overall bill was reasonable. I would return here agai
1
This is the worst BBQ chicken wings I ever had. They were dry as bone! The lady refused to exchange them when I told her these were way over cooked. The satay was also not as good. Many sticks were burnt but the kind seller replaced them. However, the satay was not tasty.The popiah (spring roll) tasted nice but my partner got sick right after dinner and threw up the popiah. Awful!!Not much choice of food too. Definitely not come here again and will NOT recommend anyone to this place
2
Food was terrible and expensive. Not the place to bring your foreign friends who are visiting SG. Will be better to make the trip over to Lau Pa Sat instead.
3
There are many varieties of food. However, it is a typical food court in Singapore.
Besides satay, there are other food stalls.
3
easy open dining place close to the gardens, we were there on Friday night with a bunch of friends and had great satay and a good time - nothing fancy, just a fun place
4
Nice dinner (satay, chicken wings, etc) before heading to Gardens By The Bay. Good variety of food and good ventilation (not the typical stuffy hawker center) will definitely be back for more.
4
We stopped here after a long, hot walk through the gardens. Not very much selection when we went at lunchtime, but we did visit one hawker who served up some pretty tasty mee goreng.
Dislike - shuttle back to town seemed to take forever.
5
The staff could do to smile a bit!! The satay , the BBQ chicken wings and especially the chendol with durian is to die for!! Clean, cheap and just a short walk through the gardens.
1
LocationInconvenient for those with no means of own transportation. You may go public;Via the Circle Line or Downtown Line:Alight at Bayfront MRT Station (CE1/DT16)Take Exit B and follow the underground linkwayExit and cross the Dragonfly Bridge or Meadow Bridge into Gardens by the BayVia the North South / Circle Line:Alight at Marina Bay MRT Station (NS27/CE2)Take Exit B and head towards the bus stop 03531 located at Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3, Central Boulevard before Marina WayHop onto bus service 400 and alight at the bus stop 03371 along Marina Gardens DriveFood for 2 paxWhat we ordered : 15 mutton satay 5 satay stripe (malay stall). Sambal sting ray, white rice (Boon tat), Cockles (Marina Seafood), Oyster omellete.Different food from 4 different stalls, and all are non satisfying! Being named SATAY BY THE BAY and labelled as the latest satay club in Spore, I expected a couple of satay stalls which we can be spoiled with. But no, there's only 1 malay and 1 chinese stall for satay. My partner wrote his review the minute we finished our meal and named it, Vulgar meat on sticks. Boon tat seafood are such reputable that I excused myself even it's non halal, but that day proved me wrong, the stingray was dry and they're very stingy on the sambal. what?! Marina seafood selling oyster omellete at $10 for small. I bought mine a few stall next to it at $7. I can get a better tasting one elsewhere at a clean slate of $5.OverallWe took a breather after dinner by the front river as we were too stuffed up with disappointment and having to chow down unpalatable food. Nayy to ever coming back :
3
The "experience" is really nothing to shout about, because this place is just a normal (and very warm) hawker centre with slightly higher pricing. So yes, you'll get all sticky, mucky, sweaty and smelly. Forget about going anywhere chic after dining here until you get a shower. Oh and good luck when it rains… Hang around my country long enough and you'd KNOW it can POUR the whole zoo over your head here! Many of us look at people doing that viral "Ice-Bucket Challenge" over the internet weird…Now the food… I refused to buy from a Malay stall who insisted that we buy a rip-off "set" - there was just two of us! So I went to a Chinese vendor next door and he entertained my small order. We even got free ketupat (rice cakes). Food pricing is higher than what you pay in heartland hawker centres but hey, this is a touristy spot.Not wanting to smell like a happening barbecue party, we ordered take-way and strolled down the bay by the hawker centre as we munched. Satay is portable food on sticks, so why endure the discomfort of a hot and humid hawker centre when you can picnic by the water? Instead of smelly sweat, you get great view and nice breeze to go with hot yummilicious satay dipped in oozy spicy peanut gravy... Wave your diet goodbye, but that is probably the cheapest "waterfront dining" trick you can pull off in downtown Singapore
4
Our satay order arrived quickly and tasted great. We ate in the early evening after an afternoon at the Domes. There were plenty of seats available, a sink to wash your hands and a selection of places to choose from for dessert too (had a massive durian ice kachang which I wish I'd shared). I would go back
2
Situated at the Southern tip of Singapore, Satay by the Bay is flanked by the beautiful Singapore city skyline, Gardens by the Bay, and the sea. Being right on the waterfront, it was serene and peaceful on the quiet evening I was there. The views are great, and there is outdoor seating for those that want to be closer to the waterfront. Besides the view, everything else was poor. Firstly, the cost is way overpriced. $2.50 for a roll of popiah that can be gotten for less than half the price elsewhere. The cheapest individual dishes like fried rice and hor fun are at least $5/6, and the zi char (ala carte) dishes are around at least $10 even for vegetables. Next, the service was laughable. All the staff working there seem to be very angry for some reason, and serve people with no expressions. When I was trying to collect my tray from the seafood stall, the cashier just slammed his hand down on the tray wordlessly. I had to infer that one more of my dishes had not arrived. It was like all the staff there were being forced to be there. Expect no service. Finally, half the stalls there were not occupied and/or closed, and the remaining half did not have much variety.I would recommend going to the nearby Lau Pa Sat for a proper and better meal experience
3
We ate once at Satay by the Bay and would have loved to return but were put off by the lack of seating.
Wait times are 20-30 minutes so make sure you take that into account if planning on seeing the light/sound show.
5
Reasonable prices, clean, quick and delicious - what more can you ask for - oh did I mention the excellent view of the bay while you eat?
2
Location wise, takes you a while to walk from the Children's At the Bay recreational area. Having got there, have to say we were quite disappointed with the selection of food. NEVER ever place and order at Sri Geyland Sate outlet - it took them 55 minutes to get an order of 10 sticks of satay. I do realise that they probably wanted the meat cooked well & everything ..... but 55 minutes is taking it way too far.Not missing much in giving this location a miss - unless you went on your daily run around the Gardens and need a cold, cool drink to quench your thirst
3
Singapore cuisine is very diverse and tasty, but the food there was not that good. the place is like the rest of garden by the bay, very good looking. the place is in a very high standard of design. the food is worse than how the rest of Singapore is. their name is too good for the place. the insides look like a normal Singaporean canteen. the beautiful one is if you sit in the outdoors. the Indonesian satay taste better than those satay. the view of the lake is very good. the food vendors shall be nicer towards the visitors. the cleaners are like the rest of Singapore canteen, old people. the old people shall be let to retire, but instead forced to work in places. going around cleaning dishes. i don't think it is fair for the people who had build Singapore in the past to still work in their ripe age of 60 s or more.the price was OK, but go in about 5.30 pm or so and eat slowly while enjoying the sunset and it is a great way to finish the day in the gardens
2
Very disappointed been there,when you hear Satay by the bay.You expect many satay sellers/stalls there.But not,only 3 malay stalls and 3 Chinese stalls there selling satay,the rest is food stalls,selling food not related to satay.They should bring back the old satay club (Padang) there.Were you can feel the authentic atmosphere .Satay and food there,not cheap.Taste so so ,and waiting is horrible.Getting there,if you do not have a transport,is quite a distance via Garden by the Bay.Prepare to take half hour walk from MBS
4
My daughter who joined me for my 2 day Singapore Stopover had told me so many good things about Satay by the Bay and it was a delicious experience. Simple seating areas, but facing the water and the twinkling lights eating prawn, beef and chicken satay with luscious peanut sauce, plus an Indian Dosai, and all so reasonably priced. Loved it
5
I didn't know this place existed until i saw a sign in Gardens by the Bay. Its a typical asian eating place, with many satay and asian food vendors all selling delicious food at good prices. I'll be coming back here next time I'm in Singapore
5
Satay satay satay - like nothing else in the world. A dish that can be done so badly but in Singapore so well.Eat tiny little morsels of satay goodness with lashings of peanut sauce, drink beer, sit by the water looking at the city lights and throw in and Indian dosai too. All costing practically nothing.Oh - taxi drivers don't seem to know where this is. It does exist - next to Gardens by the ba
4
Easy way to get to some good value satay. A nice walk through Gardens by the Bay or the free shuttle get you there. Perhaps a little artificial but clean, cheap and just as tasty. A range of other stalls if you don't want satay but the various satay stalls are the reason to go.
5
This outdoor food court, or hawker market, features food stalls specializing in a wide variety of foods, including Malay, Turkish, and several types of Chinese, among others. The dishes are very good and extremely reasonably priced. The Gardens by the Bay are close by, so after dinner, take a walk to the Supertree Grove light show! Both food and show are highly recommended
5
you can try the local food in one place. tast is great and stall worker are polite . pay a little bit higher about $2-3 more then
5
Lots of choice, fab satay and fresh juices. Kids love it. Right near to the kids fountain play area. Breeze from the bay, plenty of shade.
4
Food is wonderful and eating by the waterside just whets the appetite. Plenty of space for the kids to run around and leave parents to eat in peace. Just don't come on public hols coz the place can be crowded and the service staff [cleaners] struggle to keep up!
5
After a long day at a trade show a group of local friends took me here for dinner. There are lots of great choices and we were able to try lots of different Satay choices in an outdoor setting. If you like eating grilled meats on a stick while sitting outside, this is the place. I recommend the prawns washed down with some Tiger beer
5
After a whole day walking in the garden, I found this food heaven at the end of the garden. Its an hawker style food stall, whereby you can chill out & enjoy the amazing view while eating the most delicious and reasonable price satay in town! The pork belly satay is a must try! yummyy!! you ll not regret it
4
Went to visit Gardens by the bay and all of us got carried away playing with the little one at the park (which is by the way, really awesome). It was 8p.m. when we decided to look for food and thought we should eat at the premises. Was pleasantly surprised by the variety of stalls. Even the juices and smoothies available were fantastic (try the soursop!) Gardens by the bay was such a fantastic one stop location
4
After a long walk thru Gardens by the bay, this place is perfect to end the journey to re-fuel energy :)Although the place named Satay by the Bay, they also serve other than satay. Pizzas, indian, thai, malay food is also available.Many halal counters around Satay by the Bay. There are more than one halal satay counters, and few more other halal food counters. The food itself was great, but since we came at saturday night, the place was crowded
4
We visited the Gardens which were excellent and had a 7 minute walk to the outside food court. On a blistering hot day it doesn't get better than Satay and cold beer. The satays were great and the peanut sauce was amazing.. They had happy hour on the draft Tiger beer too !. I don't know how long this place has been here but it was very quiet when we visited. It deserves to succeed big time. Loved it 
4
There a lots of stalls here but I will only give my review on the Halal food outlets. We ordered satay (sticks of marinated chicken and beef) dipped with chunky peanut sauce from Sri Geylang Sate. Had to ask for a refill of the peanut sauce. So heavenly and mouth watering. We ordered Pizzas pastas and shrimps-sticks too. I love the sauce given to dip the shrimps. It was spicy but I loved it. The Satay by the Bay was just next to Marina Reservoir. It was serene and the sea breeze was soothing. You get to walk or run or cycle around the area and then fill in your tummy and quench your thirst
4
This little food court is situated on the seaward side of Gardens by the Bay. As such it is a bit of a walk from the tourist area of Marina Bay and Marina Bay Sands but for those with the legs it is a somewhat different experience than you normally get in Singapore as far as dining goes.You see this is not a fancy place at all. Just basically a bunch of glorified food stalls with a roof over them. There are facilities, there are a variety of foods on offer and if Gardens by the Bay grows further then it will be more in the centre of things.One option is to do the gardens in the morning and have lunch here on your way to have a look at the Marina Barrage.One last thing - I heard about this from a taxi driver. So even the locals are in the know about this place. The food is simple, the setting a tiny bit rural, but that's almost a plus in Singapore
5
Enjoyable value for money spot with numerous food options. A little out of the way but worth the effort to get to.
5
This is a little bit of a walk from the Gardens By The Bay but was well worth it. Not only Satay but a huge choice of other foods were available. The "food court" here is open 24/7
5
Loved this side food area. Loved all the satay and ability to watch your food getting cooked in front of you. Also loved the sugar cane juice.
4
We were taken to this new foodcourt by Singaporean friends. Ordered from the satay stall facing the Turkish stall. The satay arrived quickly, and was very nice. We ordered chicken, mutton, beef and grilled prawns. The chicken, beef and mutton stay was flavourful, no fatty bits, tender, very nice indeed. The grilled prawns were huge, and very fresh. The satay sauce was nice and spicy, and the ketupat was OK too.We also ordered grilled ray fish, sambal squid, kong pao chicken and kang kong belacan from a nearby stall. Everything was great except the kung pao chicken which had a very "chicken" taste, almost like the chicken was not quite fresh.I enjoyed the sugar cane juice, and the guys had beer.There were many other stalls including dessert, grilled chicken wings, Turkish, plenty of choice.After dinner we took a nice stroll along the water. Definitely going back next time we're in Singapore

Best to stated it is an Asian Food. Side dish goes with lot of vegetable, with good Sauce to dip into. Easy to eat. You can request for Blended pineapple to add in as additional sauce. Good for digestion. Have a few beer, everything is prefect for the Night. Make sure you order the Lamb meat for a prefect Night

Tucked away in the gardens between the barrage and the flower dome this area for eating is an oasis in the gardens. Meals and drinks are good prices - better than elsewhere in the Marina Bay Area. Plenty of shaded seating makes this an enjoyable break - and places to wash hands before and after with good child friendly facilities

We tried it on a weekday evening. There were plenty of empty tables, but none were suitable for eating a meal. Great shame, as there's good food available here.First the tables at the front look nice, but the stools are child size, even the table tops are too small for normal meals. I reckon if a prison used them, there'd be an outcry!Next came the many tables downwind of the satay stalls. There was a strong breeze from the north east when we went, and many of the satay stalls are upwind of the customers. So that wrote off a lot more tables.Finally a whole group of empty tables to one side, but they were all reserved! So we left without eating.We tried again Saturday 11.30am, this time we found a suitable table and had a nice lunch. By the time we left most tables were in use (except the many in the sun without any protection).Come on management, this could be such a great place to eat, sort out these issues.If you can find a nice table it's great, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there

A must do for us in Singapore is Satay Club - usually at LauPasat but we were told this was being renovated.Luckily local knowledge told us about a new place for our favourite Singapore snack - Satay by the Bay - just brilliant. Gorgeous views by the water and little sticks of tender scrumptious satay freshly grilled from whichever vendor you choose all with that moreish peanut sauce for dipping. Oh how I wish I could be transported back there now

This place is located behind Gardens by the Bay...would have never go to know about this gem of place if had not been part of the company sponsored itinerary. As the name speaks...this dinning joint is exactly on the Singapore Bay with amazing view of the Singapore skyline on the other side. Make sure you make to this place just before the sun-set...so that you enjoi every moment of serenity from this place. Note it...this place is not at all about the food, it about the view and ambiance

Chinese New Year Day 1 and I opted to have a short dinner here.I went to Sri Geylang Sate. Person who took my order promised a 30 minutes wait. I was okay with a 30 minutes wait and proceeded to order.50 minutes later, food was still not served. I went to the stall and asked where's my order. Be careful of the hooliganistic and arrogant behaviour displayed by them that is in contrast to the pleasant, overenthusiastic one when they were taking your order.Food came in 60 minutes. It was good but it did not make me feel better about the wait that was twice longer than initially promised. Prawns came 15 minutes later - a 75 minutes wait for three prawns.There were other customers who would keep coming up to their stall front and ask where's their order. Same hooliganistic and arrogant behaviour was displayed.There are other good places for satay. Save your effort going there to dampen your mood

The food stalls seem repetitive and didn't offer much variety. We did enjoy the dessert stall with shaved ice. Try the one with coconut and palm sugar. Yum!

This place surprised me with its satay.
Normally, such a touristy place doesn't serve proper food but the satay here never disappoint me and the kids.

Craved for some chilli crabs and got on a taxi to Newton Circus for some touristy but delicious chilli crabs. The taxi driver swore by the new establishment at Gardens by the Bay and recommended the food court at Satay By The Bay. Being a food Indiana Jones, we accepted the offer to try the chilli crab at Satay By The Bay.The ambiance was really commendable with the food court facing the Great Sands Casino building and the extra large Ferries Wheel. A view to kill for. The satay was good and it had this wonderfully concocted peanut sauce. The meat was lean with no trace of animal fat, thus making it a healthy meal.We got a large female crab with some really delicious crab roe. That one particular crab itself was about a kilogram in weight. It was fresh, but somehow, the ump or yum factor was not there in the chilli sauce. It was mild with no significant taste of spiciness. A taste that would probably be agreeable to those who can't take the heat of the spice. The price of the crab was way below the cut-throat price of Newton Circus. After a hearty dinner, the walk from the food court via a labyrinth to the Sands casino was really pleasant. Beautiful sight and well designed and lighted pathway.Overall, the food at the court was just average.Cheer

Sad place that does not compliment well with the world-class Gardens By The Bay. A tinge touristy.If you want satay, it still has got to be at Lau Pat Sat.Lots of tables were not cleared, and the washroom was not too well maintained. Many stores were closed down probably due to the slow business.The food was Ok by local standards and the price alright
4
I was brought here for dinner by relatives. Typical food court fare with satay as the main attraction. Most of the foods stalls serve good food and the pricing is slightly higher than what you can get at other food courts. It is in a nice location overlooking the Marina Reservoir and with the Marina Barrage nearby. Only downside is getting to the place as one has to either drive or take a taxi there. You can walk over from Marina Bay Sands but it is a hike especially if it is a bright and sunny day or if it's raining
3
Satay by the Bay in the Gardens is a great location for a light meal. While choice is limited the quality of the food is excellent. Walking here from the Sands or across the footbridge from the Float is a breeze and super relaxing. Surrounded by local families, runners and cyclists it's just a nice place to be in the evening.

Many many travelers have fond memories of the original Satay Club in Singapore. A brief incarnation ended up at Clarke quay, but not the same as those fond little men hunched over their BBQ making excellent Satay some 20 years ago.Satay by the Bay is a very poor cousin, with average food, and a bit of other food variety, but the location and style has the foundation to reignite the old Satay club. It just needs more vendors, competition should then sort out food quality.Standard was 10 small sticks of usual meat at 70c each, bit more for prawn etc. Peanut sauce was a bit sparse, and leaking flavor. Central drink vendor was cheap for a change. $1.50 for a can of coke. Better than over $6 most other places like Clarke QuayIf you are visiting Gardens by the Bay, amid pine for the old Satay club, check it out, it's a short walk from the domes.

We came here for a bite of lunch after enjoying the expensive Marina Bay Sands viewing platform. To be fair the atmosphere was not anything special - it had a food court feel to it and was mostly empty. However we thought the satay was good and it certainly was cheap - S10$ for 15 satays and rice which did for the two of us. Pleasant walk to it along the side of the gardens too. So if you are in the area and want to give the wallet a rest from the hammering it will generally get in Singapore, then enjoy a satay....but don't come here specially for this experience
1
The satays are crap, the environment is not as advertised. Man, this place is no difference from food court and the food is worst than that. If you really like satay, malaysia KL is the place to be, "Kajang satay" is famous.Lousy and crappy place!!!
4
This is not quite the old satay club, but it is close! There is a huge variety of satay vendors to choose from. Take your time to choose one.If you wish to sample pork satay you need to go to the Chinese stalls. There are other food items for sale such as grilled/BBQ seafood, steamboat and even pizza and pasta. Another must try is the BBQ chicken wings.There is also a little bar/pub in one of the sections.GO early to ensure you get a seat
3
10 Satays for S$7 was good value we thought until they came to the table and were quite small. Ones they had been cooking and which we saw were for a restaurant. The one and only bar there wasn't open which was a pity.
2
Messy layout, a far cry from what one would expect in the beautiful Gardens. What is the theme really? Satay? Or another food centre.
4
Not many stalls were opened during the weekday we were there but the satay was great. So was the person manning it as he recommended how much we should buy without overselling. Great service. Other food we had were drinks and popiah as we learnt more stalls would be opened in the evenings and on weekends

We were having a staycation over the long weekend at MBS. We had eaten at Rise and various restaurants around the hotel area and thought why not save some money and walk over to Satay by the Bay for some hawker food instead.It's located in Gardens by the Bay and somewhere near to Marina Barrage. Food was more like average, similar to what you will get from most food courts in Singapore. Ambience was pleasant as we were surrounded by plants and nature. But it can be quite warm and stuffy, so find a seat away from the satay stalls if you can.Not a lot of stalls, as I would have expected, and some seemed to be permanently closed when we were there on a Sunday evening.Satay from stall 18A was alright, but its rojak was pretty good. A bottle of Tiger beer costs around $7 and food from Marina Bay Live Seafood was economically priced too.Parking does apply, so if you just happened to be in Marina Barrage or Gardens by the Bay, then drop by to eat, if not, I think there are better places for satay in Singapore
4
I was told about this place by friends (he particularly enjoyed the chilli crab). We went here after a stroll through the gardens late afternoon and arrived before it was too busy. There are satay vendors which we tried as a starter and was delicious before deciding what we would have for dinner. We also had a bucket of beer for $20 very cheap for Singapore and was lovely just enjoying a beer and watching the world go by. We then went to watch the light show in the trees
5
Lots of variety of food as reasonable prices. Love the juice bar fresh fruit readily available.Satays were melt in your mouth chicken, pork and mutton. Well worth a meal or two there. I always gage restaurants by locals eating and this place is always overflowing with them

Visited this place for the first time today and it feels exactly the same as any other hawker centres in Singapore. The only difference is the fact that the hawker is located at the Marina Bay area and as such, enjoys pretty good views if you got the right seats. There are lots of hawker food sold but I believe the taste should be the same as the other hawkers in Singapore. Tried the satay (Chinese stall) and they are pretty average. But they do have the typical small tables and chairs like the good old Singapore during the 1960s -1970s... One thing to note is that the cost of food here may be slightly higher compared to the neighbourhood hawker centres

Satay By the Bay is complementary to the Gardens by giving visitors a place to grab a bit of the local food. As the name would have it, it offers the famous skewered meat roasted over charcoal fire to be eaten with peanut sauce and onions and cucumber. During our visit, the place was not very busy partly because it was tucked away from the major thoroughfares (even for that matter, Gardens by the Bay is not easily accessible with public transport). Nonetheless, the satay stalls pales in comparison when compared to the heydays of the Satay Club at the old esplanade during the 1970's and 80's.Since we were there, satay had to be on the main menu. We ordered a combination of beef, mutton and chicken which turned out to be quite reasonable and delicious. Other food available at the food centre are the usual stir-fried Chinese food, local delicacies like chicken rice, and spring rolls. Overall, the food centre is airy with fans to help cool you down, spacious and clean. The only drawback is that there is not much attention drawn to this place

See my full reviews & photos at = http://chefquak.com/2013/09/24/8pax-dinner-satay-by-the-bay-on-23sep2013/satay by the bay was a food court with many stalls including satays. as we were approaching in dusk, crossing a short bridge the night view/photo was quite enchanting.there were 8 of us on that evening. we ordered food to share. the bbq chicken wing was good. the rojak was good too & the satay included chicken, mutton, pork from the the chinese stall. there was no pineapple sauce though, and the pork wasn’t great, the mutton & chicken were ok. it brought back my memories on pork satay. now i remember the fatty ones properly charred were very good, though these days i don’t do much satay & almost always just chicken & mutton so i somewhat forgotten.the deep-fried sotong was something i hardly eat these days. it was good though nothing special. the pengkang stingray ok too. the hor fun had good wok hae, tasty though not much ingredients. the fried rice was ok too, with wok hae & not mushy but single grains (in teochew we say “sun sun”) but again not much ingredients just carbo. fruits were good. the makan cost S$120 for 8pax, not much but also not exactly cheap for hawker foo

Satay, the Malay skewers of chicken, beef or mutton but also shrimp (or Prawns). select a table, they will come with a menu, order. different ladies in Tiger Beer shirts will come to offer you beer. grab a pitcher and eat outside in the cool afternoon. Notice, they are working of the covered area so if it rains be ready to get wet
3
Its a 10-12 min. walk one way from the gardens. It has variety of cuisines available. We enjoyed the pizza's and the fresh juice there. Prices are reasonable compared to the restaurants at the garden.
4
This food court is quite nice, the variety of food is decent, and the view is great. Tried 2 satay stalls: City Satay for pork belly satay, and Sri Geylang (I think) for chicken, beef and prawn satay. All were pretty decent, the prawns were fresh and the taste was overall good. Getting there was a treat, I took a MRT to Marina Bay station then a free shuttle bus took us to the site. Brilliant

Went there during a visit to Marina Barrage. It is about 5 mins walk away from the barrage.Being close to attractions such as the Gardens By The Bay, I expected the prices to be way high, but it was quite reasonable for the location.It is a little more nicely renovated than a regular hawker centre, no air-con, open-air, forms part of the garden.Lots of grilled stuff, many stalls selling Satays (meat on skewers). Prices are about $0.70 per stick. There are other stalls as well - the usual hawker fare.It was a Sunday evening around 7pm, nice bustle but still lots of seats.The bar serves tiger and I had my eyes on the 3.9L tower for the next visit.Will return. Soon

Satay by the Bay hopes to revive the good old days of the Satay Club. In reality, it is just like any other hawker food centre. There are a number of satay stalls. Not all of them are good though.There is a stall selling good rojak. Everything is slightly more expensive than the normal hawker price. Still the embience is good. Surrounded by flora and fauna landscape. A good leg rest if you are visiting Gardens by the Bay.

I have been to Singapore many times already but it's my first time to visit and dined at Satay by the Bay. I enjoyed a sumptous feast of succulent, freshly grilled meat on skewers, a typical "buffet" wherein you get to cook your own food while enjoying the surrounding of lush greenery before a beautiful waterfront over looking the Marina Bay Sands. Satay by the Bay is accessible via the Marina Barrage and it is a nice walk along the reservoir to get there. It is good to go there for a casual get-together with your family and friends. So many satay stalls to choose from. Great food, terrific views! You will kept on coming back! Plus the price is very affordable. Fast and good service too

We came upon this place after walking from the other side of the river, ( from Stadium MRT ). It is very new and has a pleasing, open feel. We arrived at around 7 pm on a Sunday evening and had no trouble finding seats. Everything was very clean. The bathrooms were particularly nice for a hawker style place. The bar overlooks a beautiful pond. You can get satay, pizza, Turkish, Chinese, Indian, etc. A nice view over the river. Possibly not as cheap as a neighbourhood hawker centre, but it is all about location. If you are the barrage or at gardens by the bay, and want a casual meal, outdoors in a pleasant setting, then this is a good choice.It is closer to the barrage than to Bayfront MRT. However, given the walk from the MRT is through the beautiful gardens, I can't see why anyone would complain. It would be about 20 mins. If dining out is just about the food for you, then perhaps this place is just average. For me the food is almost secondary to the experience. I love eating outdoors with a breeze and a nice view, so really enjoyed satay by the bay
3
Great setting and pretty good food, but nothing special. Get there early at 630 when not crowded. That way you get to sit in peace comfortably and avoid long queues for food. Also you can then eat and watch the sun go down and the gardens light up. Satay is to be honest average and more expensive, but it's a great experience and fun to bring visitors.
4
At one end of the Gardens on the Bay - a bit of a walk!But well worth it. The Satay was delicious, chicken, beef and jumbo prawn. Also had pineapple rice, Thai seafood rice, Turkish kebab and chips!What a mix. And there is everything there. Indian food, Pizzas, Chinese, Thai, Satay, Beer, soft drinks the list goes on and on.Prices were reasonable and the food hot and freshOpen all hours I believe.Worth a pit stop if you are at the Gardens on The Ba

Bad experience. Ordered from Sri Geylang Satay. From now till end July there is a satay promotion. Order 20, get 10 free. Guess what... I did not get them when I ordered 40 sticks. Excuse from the staff: oh u never say promotion. Seriously!!!! I was here a week ago and had at City Satay. The guys there immediately informed me of the promotion. Not too honest of a stall this Sri Geylang Satay. Try the other one better and more important, more honest!!!
2
Firstly, at 7.30 pm quite a few stall already closed. Place was rather empty. Worse the promotion of extra satay made a mockery by 'Sri Geylang Sate' insisting that it was for chicken only. Attitude was bad and arrogant. Arguing with customers. No reason for a second visit if current situation doesnt improve. There are of course other food stalls but if its called "Satay by the bay" , obviously people go there for satay and would expect a lot of satay stalls. There was only 3 muslim satay stalls and one was closed.There are Chinese satay stalls though
