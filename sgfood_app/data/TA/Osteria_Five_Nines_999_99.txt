We had a 6 course dinner ($49++). The food is very nice and the service is good. Too bad that the restaurant is a bit small and the location is not so convenient. Overall is still a happy experience.

Restaurant located in a very old sleezy building which you won’t expect. Food was good not awesome so don’t over expect.

Had a dinner at Five Nines last month. Food was average and the portions were very small. The service staffs are friendly.
Thank you!

Food was ok but it was in an old mall with lots of KTV bars. Could have been better, food was alright but the surrounding area made it not such a great experience

Celebrated my friends birthday there. Food was comparable to 5-star fine dinning restaurant. Prices are more than reasonable and staff commendable service made me and my Friend feel so special! Mr Ohkawa is a fantastic Chef!

This is my 2nd time patronizing Five Nines Restaurant. First time was at Keong Siah Street, the ambiance over there is more romantic and nicer as compared to the newly shifted place at Cuppage Plaza.The service provided by the waitress there was excellent. Food quality standard remains good. I love the lobster bisque spaghetti and "Hiroshima" oyster. As for my friend, she preferred the king crab cream croquette and the sea urchin with the angel hair. The food were very flavorful. Hope the food quality remains in their high standard. I hope to see more promotion if possible. Definitely, will patronize this restaurant once again

A wonderful dining experience with Japanese approach to fine French dining. The casual nature of the dining experience shows a balance between refined sensibility of the clearly talented Chef set in a humble location and highly accessible price point! I would recommend this to anyone adventurous enough to seek out a novel and exciting Chef in a small and personal experience set among the KTV nitelife of Cuppage Place. I would recommend the set 6-course menu! Let the Chef impress you with his menu selections

Made a reservation for 6pm (opening time), came in to an empty restaurant which progressively got busier with customers at about 7pm onwards.Ordered a lobster pasta and was very pleased with it.Ordered the 6 course set meal as well, food was fresh and good but thought that the serving was abit small.Overall a good experience with the restaurant, will come back for their lobster pasta again

In less than salubrious surrounding, with Japanese Karaoke bars surrounding us, we did not know what to think but this 5 seater restaurant came up trumps with the quality of food. Small but well thought out menu and a pleasant team. Clearing of plates though was an issue. Lovely presentation, great tastes and a very good but small wine list. A great venue for casual dining
