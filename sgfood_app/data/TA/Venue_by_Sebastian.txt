A little gem featuring what I would call Italian/French classics with a modern twist. Chef Sebastian front and centre plating every dish personally. Service staff also very attentive and crisp. Will definitely recommend and return.

Small plates sharing was perfect as it allowed for a tasting of a number of offerings on the menu. Staff were especially attentive and helpful.

Food here is not bad, but just be prepared to spend a little more as the portion is tapas portion (meaning small). The staff did try to explain to us, but as someone who doesn't have an idea what tapas is, I admit I was caught off guard by the portion and price.We spent around $90 for two people, with just three dish and two drinks ordered. The place is really popular though, with many people making reservations, and the food is definitely nice, just that the pricing may not be for everyone.3 stars for the service and food quality, minus the price. Would recommend this place if you want to try a slightly more upscale tapas place

Always an enjoyable evening whenever I dine there. Efficient service, yet friendly enough to make you feel at home. Always try the recommended dish of the day. Tends to run out if you go late but that certainly adds an element of surprise to the evening. Oh yes, donâ€™t forget the pear tart

Food is good and you can tell Chef Sebastian uses quality ingredients. Service is also top notch. The Chinese style dim sum sharing concept is quite novel but may be a little difficult if dining with friends (unless very close friends or family). The only issue we have is that it is pricey. At that price, one can certainly get something more substantial elsewhere for at the end of the meal, one feels ok but somehow not really full. We actually wondered if we should go for supper later! And we had spent about $60 a head

I loved Sebastian's food at Ember and was disappointed when it closed. Clearly, I went to Venue excited. Unfortunately, this is a real step down from what he produced at Ember. OK, the venue is much more informal and frankly a bit odd being an open extension of the shopping area of a CBD building. But even considering this I felt the food was less much less interesting than what he was doing at Ember and expensive for what it is. Other reviews are right to say that quality is high and service was fairly prompt. I just found it a bit boring

I visited Venue 2 months ago and I thoroughly enjoyed the food. The food at Venue is non pretentious with high quality ingredients. I can tell that every dish was very well throught through. The portions are quite small, ideal for sharing to try more dishes. I tried several dishes and they were all very well prepared. The stand out for me was the truffle abalone pasta. The staff on the floor was polite, helpful and ever ready to serve. Highly recommended

Celebrated friend's birthday here. The ribeye, duck confit and seabass are good. However, the duck confit portion seems to be rather small. The portions are rather small for sharing. We ordered quite a number of dishes as we ended up still hungry due to the small portions. The price we paid ended up to be close to fine dining prices

We heard about this place and had planned to visit for some time. As the location is very much out of the way for us, we have left it until now to check it. Even this was by chance as one of our sons had an activity to attend close by one weekday evening. The deco of the place was very simple with two long bar tables at the entrance. There was no glass nor door partition at the restaurant - am not sure why. It's a good thing too that the smell of the food and cooking does not permeate out of the kitchen and out into the shopping corridor.We ordered the artichoke soup, white bait, Parma ham with salad, burrata with tomatoes and mussels (special of the night). For mains, we had the flat pasta as well as the Chilean seabass. We had the 2 bottles of cider and a glass of wine to go with the meal. Food was well prepared and came in succession rather quickly. My husband enjoyed the mussels whilst I loved the soup and the seabass. The seabass reminded me of what we used to have back at Ember when the chef used to helm it. We were too full but still had room to share one dessert and that was the apple pie with ice cream. Overall, an enjoyable meal as we felt that the portions are just nice for us. We love tapas style food as we can sample more variety of food. We paid the bill and managed to arrive ahead of time to pick up our son. An evening well-spent in my opinion
