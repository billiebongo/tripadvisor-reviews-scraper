What a great place to stumble upon, really enjoyed my meal here and would highly recommend Porky Pork to anyone. Very competitively priced, very friendly staff(something very hard to find in Singapore) and the variety was excellent!

This little place has homemade sausages, excellent BBQ sauce (again home made), and REAL potato in their mashed potatoes, not some ready-made mix. I also enjoy their homey hospitality. Simple, unassuming, smoky (love that!) and satisfying! Also catch them for their daily lunchtime specials.-you'll get some lovely specialities
