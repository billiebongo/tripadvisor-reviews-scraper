Hipster isakaya. Interesting food here and good selection of sake. Love the salted egg pork and the century egg tofu.

Random location for such a nice and cozy izakaya place.The rolls are really good and the yakitoris are nice.I haven’t tried yet their “fusion” dishes but so far, it is good.The staff is nice and friendly and their selection of sake is interesting.A good place to stop if you are in the neighborhood

Attempt at Japanese fusion ala tapas setting - not quite there - fried squid tasteless marinate getting in the way of a good fry - chicken wing is so unJapanese - sushi was still thawing - but great family feel if you don’t mind comfort food feel - expensive to boot

We first get to know about this jap restaurant because we frequent Lots Gourmet, which serves western food along the same stretch of shops. Got to know the friendly boss Daniel, and his amazing staffs. Ki is a jap restaurant set up by the same hardworking boss, and one would often see Daniel sweating it out, dishing yummy jap cuisines for his customers at the back of the kitchen. My daughter especially love his tamago, and claims they are the best tamagos in Singapore. The menu of Ki Bar are unique and interesting. I love their grilled chicken wings, fried chicken skin, bun slider, garlic prawn. They also offer a good choice of sake, whisky alcohol and beverages, and my friends and I would come over to chill sometimes. we love the ambiance of Ki, and it is a quaint and clean little restaurant with its own unique class and character. So glad I am staying near to it, and had tried walking back home from this little gem

This is one of my favourite place. They serve excellent Izakaya and Jap food with nice range of Jap drinking list. The deco is really beautiful with nice friendly service staff. My wife and I will head out to this place for supper when our kiddos are asleep.

Dined here on a weekday night. This place sells Japanese and Korean fare.Had two starters which were nice, mains were disappointingly average.. For that price, there are plenty of better places to eat. Their kitchen couldn't keep up and I waited more than 30 mins before the first starter came out. If I'm in the area I would pop by, but I won't go back for seconds. Cheer

Been here several times since its opening, food is consistently well cooked and extremely flavourful. They have recently changed their menu and must try dishes include; tuna tartare, edamame truffle oil, spicy bulgogi buns, short ribs, chicken wings mentai. All grilled to perfection. Food takes a while but that's because they are all freshly cooked upon order. Good selection of sake with choices to suit the traditional sake lovers and those who prefer their alcohol fruity and sweet!Definitely Worth Travelling to in the Far East
