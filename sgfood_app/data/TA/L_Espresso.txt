Great sandwiches, cold cuts and selection of afternoon tea delights. Price range is good and quality of food is good too! recommended for families with kids, seniors or for those seeking to have a nostalgic afternoon!

Excellent food. Reasonably priced. We did not have champagne. It was a fund raiser for breast cancer when we went went and most of the food wad pink. Pink chocolate fountain,cakes and sandwiches. Tea was also pink very tasty. Would recommend for afternoon tea.

A very nice hi tea at Goodwood park hotel. Good spread of food. Every Pax with 2 servings of drinks. Nice ambience too. The chocolate fountain is the high light for the kids!
4
The spread was excellent, catering to all age groups and tastebuds. The choice of tea and coffee available was excellent. We enjoyed the ambience, which was relaxed. Good place to unwind. Unfortunately, there is no complimentary car park for having high tea in L'Espresso.

I can't believe this restaurant is in 5-star hotel. I told some people my situation again and again but I waited for our tea more than 45 minutes. Not worth for coming again.

My husband and I went for afternoon tea here with high expectations after hearing good reviews. Whilst the staff were FANTASTIC (constantly clearing plates and replacing cutlery) and there is plenty of choice in the buffet, we went for the 4.30pm and it felt a bit like we were eating ‘leftovers’. Fresh food was no longer being put out and some things had clearly run out (no plain scones left etc). Some of the hot food at this point had also got cold. In addition, the dining area felt a little dated and could do with being modernised - the green leather chairs appeared to have seen better days. My summary would therefore be enjoyable but with room for improvement to make it great again.

service here was awesome. very friendly and attentive staff. the area is pretty open and spacious, and you'll be reasonably spaced away from the next table to have some quality, private conversations with your friends/family. food selection for high tea isn't fabulous, but still a good mix of savoury and sweet. pricing is quite reasonable as well
5
Food was awesome, especially the scones & open face sandwiches. Loves the salmon topped with caviars. Oh, not forgetting the veal bourguignon. It will be perfect to eat it with steaming hot rice! And, yes, they served ice creams as well. this place was a favorite for high tea when residing in singapore and it still is. Definitely worth trying it out eventhough it's like RM160+ (pardon our currency weakness) per pax now.

A treat from a family member. As it is a weekend, our sitting was from 12noon to 2:30pm. Though early, we were welcome to sit and take our tea & coffee while waiting. The chairs are cosy, wide range of food, attractively displayed. The pastries surprisingly not too sweet. Tea & coffee only have a servings per person. The service staff are attentive. I would say in general, a perfect place to relax, with time to catch up with one another. The price a little on the high side. $38++. But again we pay for the service & ambience too

Amongst the many good high tea offerings in Singapore, I would rate L'Espresso's very highly. You have to reserve a table because its popular and usually fully booked. The savoury selection comprises about 10 type of finger sandwiches, a good selection of warm prawns, chicken, vol-au-vent, , soup and bread-crumbed items. This is the western high tea as oppose to the Asian high tea which is at another restaurant in the hotel.There are 3 types of scones , 4 jams, butter and clotted cream- very nice indeed. The bread and butter pudding , Creme brûlée are decent enough. Then a good selection of mini cakes , macaroons, ice-cream as well. The drinks selection has about 12 teas- black, green , jasmine, Quan yin, various coffees and cold drinks too. You are allow 2 choices of drinks from this wide selection. The lobby is a busy area whilst you sit in the comfy chairs savouring the food and tea, you wouldn't notice the busy- ness and noise. Very good value for money - I went at noon , had a great high tea and skipped dinner 
5
Afternoon tea served from midday, A selection of entrees, cold cuts, cheeses, hot dishes, delicious sweets, ice cream etc. Very popular with the locals
4
Nice cozy place. Alot of finger food n delicious pastries. Must try the delicious Scones. Nice flavoured Tea's. Staffs are pleasant.
5
Enjoyable high tea buffet with 2 choices of beverage. Pick seating outside on the terrace with the pool nearby. There is a vast selection of food items for any palate and all are well made with attention to the fine details. Service is good.
5
We made a reservation for High Tea on a Saturday.It was a buffet styled high tea with a good spread and selection (sandwiches, pies, roast, cakes, desserts).Have to say though that the most memorable part of the visit was the service we got. There was a service staff, Chee Meng, who was very attentive, friendly and prompt. He always served with a smile and ensured request for drinks or refills are promptly met

I am surprise with the current service level of The GoodWood Park Hotel. I have visited GoodWood Park hotel many times in the past. This is the most disappointing time with you guys. I request for a change of sitting due to the extreme Hot weather, Due to a private function I was reject. That was fine, but when we ask for 4 glasses on cold water the waiter was seems unwilling to serve us due to grumbling that we might be changing our seats. Do we have to ask to be serve and is this the kind of standard that Goodwood Park degrading to? Also the quality of the durian puff. It come frozen hard and they ask me to wait for 30min to 45mins to before I can consume it. The best moment was your Manager has the cheek to say it was fresh from the kitchen. I really find it hilarious. I think this will be my last time coming for your service. P.S visiting time at 4.35pm. Still waiting for my durian puffs to defrost
4
I recommend this place for high tea. the selection of product is great. you have a large choice of starter and main. for dessert you can find scones, chocolate fountain and fresh fruits. the lava cake is simply delicious.do not forget to book. it is very convenient on line
5
Last time I had an afternoon tea at the Goodwood was 12 years ago. We used to come here almost every weekend and I Ioved it. After visiting last week I am happy to say that the Goodwood's afternoon tea only got better. Great selection of everything, better than the Ritz in my opinion.Go there, this so much fun
4
I love to come to L'Espresso. Firstly is the ambience and secondly the food. They have a wide selection of cakes, desserts, chocolates, canapÃ©s, savoury food and many more. Reservations are definitely a must during weekend. For $49 (before GST) it is definitely on the high side. If you are planning to drive, never park at Goodwood Park as the parking fee is exorbitant. Park at Far East Shopping Centre instead

The high tea at L'Expresso is quite an institution in Singapore. On a visit this week, it was good to see the standard of service and quality of the food are still good. Everything that we had from the buffet was tasty and nicely prepared. We particularly liked the savoury items. The famed scones were delicious though for those who are fans of the traditional scone, the ones served here are a little too breadlike and do not have the crumbly biscuit texture that Mary Berry would be looking out for.The lobby lounge setting with lots of natural light and a view of the pool add to the enjoyment of an afternoon spent here. As does the traditional vintage look crockery. Charming

L'Espresso has a delightfully modern approach to the venerable tradition of English tea: rather than keep to the traditional selection of finger sandwiches and savory cakes, they have turned it into a full-fledged buffet, replete with warm dishes. Along with the old favourites you will find pork goulash, potato-wrapped prawns and a marvelous warm baked salmon in chive sauce. As for the main event, one is permitted to select two drinks and we found our choices to be excellent: English Breakfast and Sencha teas which were light to the palate and delicate of aroma. Furthermore the house coffee is full of flavour and not overpowering. If there is one thing to fault in this experience, it is the service. One cannot escape the impression that the servers are inexperienced, with our request for sweetener causing confusion among the wait staff, as well as the inordinate wait to be noticed by folks with harried expressions. If they can get their act together in this aspect, then the L'Espresso team will have created a truly unique experience
4
If you love English high tea, this is one of the place you have to visit.
I love to sit here and just drink tea... It is so relaxing.
Their scones are also excellent.
5
The high tea is buffet style and offers so much variety. Apart from the usual high tea offerings there was also some hot foods, a chocolate fountain, ice cream, cheese platters. One of the best high teas we have experienced.
5
Rather than the usual silver rack, L'Espresso offers an enormous range of savoury and sweet food. The (fairly high) price includes two drinks from a range of hot and cold tea, coffee and chocolate. Service was excellent.
4
Good spread. Good quality. Good ambiance. Remember to make reservations to prevent disappointment. Highly recommended!
5
For high tea, you better book....it's not the usual high tea served on a multi tiered tray but actually a buffet. ...A must try and enjoy the variety of cakes, sandwiches, scones, finger food....after which no need to take dinner....and maybe no lunch either and save your space for the high tea...Enjoy....

We went for the 2pm afternoon tea in January 2016 for a family celebration. As we are all vegetarians and we informed the hotel beforehand at the time of making an online reservation, the hotel prepared special sandwiches, samosas and curry puffs for our table only. This is one of the few hotels which has called to confirm our reservation and called to check our dietary restrictions. They really go the extra mile at Goodwood Park Hotel and know how to make their customers feel special. The high tea deserts were simply one of the best I have had in Singapore (the other really excellent High Tea value for money desert spread is at the Carousel on Scotts Road). We must have gone up to get food about 10 times and we never got tired or bored of the food! The service staff were excellent and were on the ball and gave special attention to our little girl. The grounds are just so quaint so after our meal, we went for a walk near the pool side and enjoyed the breeze. All in all, a truly memorable experience. Highly recommended for all

The 5 of us, from Melbourne - Australia, spent 12 glorious days in Singapore - Oh gosh... I love this city... We'll be back next year - NO DOUBT AT ALL...!!!We ate at lots, and lots of places... But the 'Traditional English Afternoon Tea' at CAFE L'ESPRESSO, in the BEAUTIFUL Goodwood Park Hotel STILL STANDS OUT as one of the BEST...!!!Actually, the whole experience: Place; Comfort; Service; Food & Beverages; Value for Money was my HIGHLIGHT of Singapore...Please, if in Singapore - DO NOT MISS THIS...!!!Visited in mid December 2015 whilst on family holida

As my mom's birthday falls on December, and yesterday (Dec 31) was the last day to use the $20 voucher from Goodwood Park Hotel, we came to this place for afternoon tea. The price includes two drinks from a range of hot and cold tea, coffee and chocolate etc. I had the hot chocolate, while my mom had the English breakfast tea, She added some milk into it. Guessed that must be because her tummy is sensitive to the milk that is being used, she got 2 times indigestion (loose water bowels) at night, just before dinner. Have to say that the selection is not as extensive as the international high tea. However, have to admit that their crispy chicken is really tasty. Also, if you are a desserts person, will suit your palates. There are 3 choices of ice cream- strawberry, vanilla and chocolate. Also, quite a range of fruits, both for if you want to eat it just as plain fruits, or to go with chocolate sauce. Service is definitely excellent, as the moment that you finished the plate of food, the waiter will come up quickly to collect it. Just that feel that even with the discount voucher, on the Eve of public holiday, it is still about $67 per adult, so it is really expensive. So we feel that it is not value for money

A historically interestingly building …. Went for the high tea from 2pm …. One of the best I have had in Singapore in terms of variety and value – not just cakes – good buffet spread with hot options – more like a late lunch …. Pleasant garden to stroll through too …
5
It's value for money. Though it's not as extensive as those international high tea, it's filling enough and most importantly it's really really tasty. The ingredients used are very fresh and it's buffet style so you can grab as many times as you like. It's much worthy than those non refillable high tea set at most hotels. Only downside is the walking distance from mrt to hotel but I'll definitely come back again.
4
Traditional English Tea with good service. Although there was not much variety of savoury items, it was tastefully presented and were great. The desserts were of high standards too, with a couple of local flavours.
4
The tea buffet is really nice and the scones quite authentic if you compare with the fullerton.
They have a nice selection of savoury bites which are better than the common sandwich offerings you get for high tea.

Disappointing and pricy. About 18 months ago we had a great High Tea here, so I thought we would replicate this for Mother's Day. Unfortunately the food was mediocre and the staff was confused (as they were last time) at S$ 300+ for two adults and two children I expected more. After an initial mix-up with the booking 12pm instead of 3pm (luckily rectified the day before when the called to confirm, kudos) we initially given a seat inside although we had booked for a seat outside (it can get very cold inside). The set up for the HT buffet is convenient, a great selection of sandwiches and small bites, although some of the bread was a bit stale. Nice cheese and salad selection. The warm section was disappointing and everything had the same brown fried look to it, fish cakes, potatoes wedges, chicken fingers. There was a salmon wellington, that added some colour. Some more colour and fresh ingredients would have been nice, now it felt like everything was recently warmed up. The dessert was excellent, kids loved the chocolate fountain and there was a variety of small cakes. The Movenpick ice cream was delicious and there was a whole array of things for the kids to add on the ice cream. Nice touch was the "chocolate handbag" we received after we paid. Over all not worth the 300+ price tag
5
Absolutely loved, loved, loved the English high tea. Served every afternoon the range of food on offer is just superb - it is a feast for they eyes as well as the stomach. Cannot recommend this highly enough - a must do for any foodie visiting Singapor

This tea lounge at the Goodwood Park Hotel offers a lovely afternoon tea. With seating inside in the lobby restaurant or overlooking the pool area outdoors. The Goodwood is a charming heritage hotel. We enjoyed the traditional English high tea. Service was prompt & friendly. The array of delicious savoury & sweet tea treats was extensive! Loved the mini cakes & cheese tarts. A wonderful afternoon tea - always good - this was our second trip here (2 years after the first). Will return again

$45++ for a high tea buffet is expensive though not the most pricey in this city of millionaires. The scones and tea ("Orange Wood" was our choice) were very good, the pastries nothing special nor the coffee. Service was prompt but rather robotic, and questions about the items could not easily be answered. As vegetarians, we asked for veggie sandwiches and were served some crude looking tomato and cheese sandwiches, surely cucumber sandwiches, a staple of high teas, could have been provided
3
High tea was not exciting although well delivered and completely acceptable. The mocha was not very coffee and the coffee was not very strong. The high tea buffet held a good selection and the food itself was lovely, but nothing was outstanding or interesting. Having dined at the Coffee Lounge (also at Goodwood Park) for High Tea, it is a much more interesting experience and will go back to that one.Do not book the outside tables if you do not smoke as guests move out there to smoke and the smoke covers all the tables as everything is under cover
1
$45++ per pax is overpriced for the limited selection. Ordered hot chocolate and coffee- only got milk taste. Instant Cadbury got chocolate taste better than the hot choc. Sandwiches and scones are nice but the creme brûlée is disappointing (too sweet). We decided to give dessert a miss after eating creme brûlée.
5
At S$45 per person the afternoon tea was on the pricey side, but the food was excellent, and it was an excellent place to unwind for the afternoon, before flying out of Singapore.The chairs were comfortable, the location adjacent to the hotels lobby was nice, the quality and variety of sandwiches and canapes was excellent, and well complimented by the wide variety of deserts.I would quite happily return

I often stay at the Goodwood Park Hotel. I enjoy the old-world style even though the place is a bit jaded. The old-world style is reflected in the comfortable green leather chairs that are in L'Espresso, the ever-popular lounge area at the hotel.L'Espresso is good because it is open late. You fly in to Singapore at around 9pm, grab a taxi and by 10pm you are just in time for the last order.Nothing beats a good yum cha and L'Espresso has an interesting selection of steamed delights and more, sufficient to fill you up just before heading to bed. I have had a late night meal there several times, generally good, but not always consistent in quality. Try the 'white/black' or 'salt/pepper' bun combo. It is good. Plus there are other good choices, but for late night, skip the fried choices. Sit back with a nice glass of wine or cognac and watch the many revellers walk by as they are leaving one of the function rooms at the hotel, having been at an enjoyable wedding or just sit and look at the great cake display in the bakery opposite L'Espresso. Time goes by quickly, old-world style
5
Good value as it's lunch and dinner together! Large buffet, so many sandwiches and beautiful scones. It's a high tea, so hot food is also on offer.
5
Raffles has the history but for value for money and one of the best all round High Teas - don't go pass L"Espresso

Cafe L'espresso at Goodwood Park Hotel earned itself the title of a place for elegant teatime pursuits, and is a favorite haunt for anyone who is looking to enjoy a sumptuous high tea in this quaint, luxurious boutique hotelIt boosts of a cozy, classy environment complete with comfortable armchairs and also a poolside terrace offering gorgeous views. We sat indoors though, around the round dark-glass tables and cushy chairs. The outdoors looked very tempting, but the hot sun had us ducking back into the comfort of the cool interiors.I had my pot of tea and we were all ready to attack the food counters. We were excited about this "English high tea" concept - I was thinking all sorts of traditional English muffins and tea-cakes, scones etc. A little disappointed that there weren't much of those, but nonetheless, the overall spread was goodThere were assortments of savoury items such as mini crossant sandwiches and other finger sandwiches, Nicoise tartlets, mini shrimp patty burger, baked pork meatloaf, farm chicken in crepes, roast beef with cornichons, and open-faced sandwiches of prawns with pineapple salsa, brie cheese with grape, and smoked salmon with beetroot mousse and caviar etc.For those who like hot food, there were crispy vegetable croquettes, deep fried chicken karaage and Swedish meatballs.As for the sweets, there are an assortments of cupcakes, scones, muffins, pecan pie, lime cake, strawberry shortcake and chocolate fondue etc. For more detailed information and photos, do check out:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/english-high-tea-at-cafe-lespresso.htm

The high tea buffett here is fabulous. We also tried another high tea at the Ritz that cost more and not nearly as good. So I highly recommend this place. We made reservations and were seated as soon as arrived. You get 2 drinks, I picked hot chocolate(it comes in a tea pot, so there are several servings) and lemon tea. Also, you can have water if you need more to drink. The buffett was filled with sandwiches, crossiant sandwiches, creme brulee, bread pudding, ice cream, fruit, lazagna, cheeses, and whole dessert table. The mango shots and small lemon cupcakes were the best from the dessert table. Probably my favorite thing was the bread pudding that came with a vanilla sauce and fruit topping. All there scones and strawberry jam were very good too.If you plan to go to high tea, this is the restaurant to choose
4
Place was packed so we sat outside by the pool. Lovely set up, comfy rattan chairs, white linen, proper porcelain tea set and high quality tasty food really makes the difference for a lovely high tea experience. The selection of 14 types of teas is a delight for tea lovers. One can have unlimited orders of drinks be it the different types of coffee to iced teas/coffee/chocolate. The buffet comprise of fresh fruits, assorted canapés, sandwiches, yummy fritters, scones with assorted jams, bite sized cakes, creme brulee and delectable desserts. My favorite is the shot glasses of mango mousse and lime soursop mousse. This is certainly one of the best places for high tea with good quality food, attentive staff and a great selection of tea
3
We booked to come here for the Mother's Day English High tea, and having frequented Goodwood Park's Restaurant and Deli before, we were always very satisfied and hence thought it would be a perfect occasion for Mother's Day lunch. Don't get me wrong the spread was quite good, and the staff were very friendly, however, I do not think it represents good value for money for the food. for an English High tea buffet one would think the buffet would be extended to tea and coffee, but was surprised that this only included 2 drinks which was a bit disappointing. Having said that the ambience was great and this is the price you pay for mother's day
5
We had a local Asian high tea here on Easter Sunday and for the value of $33++ it was great. All the local favorites were on offer, fresh, tasty and well presented. Th dessert bar which had the local bread and butter pudding was super.Great place to bringing a group of friends along and spending a lazy Sunday afternoonWe will be going back again
4
We had coffee and a la carte sandwiches at L'Espresso during tea time because we were not hungry enough to have a full high tea. My club sandwich was very good, and my wife's ham and cheese sandwich was good. The French fries that accompanied them were average. The area seemed very well attended during high tea, perhaps because we were there during the Christmas season, and we felt fortunate to have a seat. Service was between average and very good, probably because most diners were eating the buffet and required little service. The location in the lobby is friendly and open, making us understand why L'Espresso is a favorite location for high tea in the Scotts Road area
2
We went for the Christmas Day brunch for 2-5pm seating which was laid in the lobby and patio and the seating was spread across Gordon grill n L'espresso. We paid in advance for this brunch. It's $128++ food only, so is a good deal for a festive brunch. The appetizer, cheese and desserts were decent. But the mains were a disappointment. The food was cold. Also the chaffing dishes were huge so the food was not refreshed regularly. It was dry and looked unappetizing at 330pm when I went for it.Also the layout not very aesthetic. The chefs had their workstation behind the Appetizer buffet. It was right in the open with all the food warmed cabinets, clearances, empty utensils, used cling wraps n silver foil lying around on the work stations. I have been to the hi tea often which is excellent. But would not rate the brunch highly. I don't wish to criticize but hope they take this positively as they are a very practical solutions. Buffet has to look aesthetic along with being practical for both guests and staff. They just have to realize people utilize all the 3 hours for brunch and by the time they come to mains is probably after 2 hours. So keep the portions low for you to refresh frequently. After all its not a wedding buffet where guests are in a rush to eat and leave after the ceremony

When it comes to high tea, English High Tea always my first choice. We went to the hotel without reservation, this is my first high tea experience and I did not know reservation is required and it was so crowded on the way.My experience is really really great. So far this is still the best and I like the most. You have enough variety to choose from, if you dun like certain stuff, you still have large alternative.I love their sandwiches, dessert and tea. The bread they use, presentation and everything just so nice. They had smoked salmon in small serving. The Crème brûlée & bread pudding were nice and I had 2 portions.I especially like the culinary set that use to serve the food. It is just so English. I will sure be back and if you want me to suggest where you can have high tea. That must be L’Espresso!
