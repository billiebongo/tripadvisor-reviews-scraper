Value for money casual Japanese dining!! Extensive menu makes you spoilt for choice~ Desserts are good too!! =)
5
Big and spacious. Quiet and friendly staffs. Tasty food, portion slightly less. Trade-off with the atmosphere. :)
4
from the first steps into the restaurant, i was treated with the utmost respect from all the employees.
5
Food is delicious! Service was great! Had the curry rice. Kurobuta pork was nice. Curry was not too spicy too.

Chope redeem voucher canâ€™t be used with set lunch. Since I already redeemed the vc before I found out about it, I had to pay what I had with ala carts price, ending up saving about $3 instead of $10.
5
Nice food, a lot of variety, big portion too. Like the Chicken & asparagus pasta. Cake looks good as well.
4
I like is the location located in bugis junction, convenience location and can earn capistar after spend there, food is no bad but found out they need man power to speed their service.
3
I remembered their salmon ikura pasta used to be so much more tasty. Now it is no longer al-dente. Smoke salmon should be raw or less than half cooked.. but its well done nowadays. This place used to be my fav place for japanese pasta, I think I need to source for alternatives now
5
My favourite is their cheese baked rice with fried chicken thigh $16++ served with Japanese curry! The chicken is so crispy and flavorful! The carbonara was recommended by the staff. It's was good too. I'm abit curious as to why I pay for service charge but I have to help myself to the water. Saw some cups with some remnants of green leafy things in the cups. Not clean . Staff was friendly and quick to respond once I called for service. There is a service call button on every table

Ordered a medium rare steak but a completely well done steak was served. When the waitress returned the steak to the chef he said that the steak is too thin to make a medium rare. It's either well done or rare. Nothing in between.I said no thank you. It's a poor excuse for incompetence. Paid for my drinks and left. It Pepper Lunch can provide a medium rare steak for under $10, i can't see why they cannot serve a half inch steak medium rare
4
Nice Japanese casual dining concept by MOF!! Curry Omu Rice is good!! Despite having the same dessert menu as MOF~ =)
4
Lunch promo is worth it. 10.90 for main course n drink. Very value for money. However service is a bit slow.
4
The set lunch was 10.99++ including one main dish and one drink. I had pepperoni pasta, which was good.
4
Location convenient. We ordered one pasta dish and one salmon dish. Pricing was reasonable. Food quality was reasonable.
2
Long waiting time for food despite restaurant being only half-packed.. Cashier named Joy was not helpful in providing a solution to redeem Chope's voucher.
4
Came here for lunch during weekday and ordered the grilled chicken thigh. The price was very good and so was the food. Really worth it. Recommended.
4
When we first step in, the smell of the food attracted us & make us wonder what food was it that we must order... Had their beef & salmon combi which taste great! Food was good & staff were friendly... my Daughter loves it..
4
No frills Japanese Italian fusion casual dining!! Food is ok but the dessert is quite expensive~ Ambience is good!! =)

A great catch up with my friend for a lunch at Dolce Tokyo. This is the first time I visit this restaurant. We ordered a pizza to share. It was a great idea that Dolce allowed us to top up $2.50 to a large size pizza to get two flavours which it suited our choice cos one likes bacon & egg flavour while the other likes pineapple & ham. For the drink, we chose a pot of green tea with brown rice which was fantastic to go with the pizza. As for dessert, we shared a slice of Choco banana cake which was served in a bird cage. That's was a surprise & very interested cake presentation. It was a great, full lunch at this lunch meet-up
3
We ordered Pan Fried Salmon and Jiggae Kimchi Somen for our meals; Azuki Bean and Matcha Latte Deluxe for our drinks and a Dessert Bento. I think the food was quite nice, especially the drinks. However our food came quite slow and there was a lack of friendliness shown from the waiters.Maybe it could be improved as the atmosphere was quite nice
4
Food portion was good, price was reasonable... the only set back was that food arrived very slowly. A good place for chit chat.. no wifi available.
5
Reallt satisfied with the food and price. The ambience also good. Definitely will come back again in tbe future.Thank you
4
The dessert after the average mains was the highlight, which still makes the experience a plesant one!
4
*They have plenty of dishes to serve from appetizer to dessert
*Quick Service
*Food is tasty and flavorful
*Not so expensive as you will have take away
4
The somen and pasta were delicious but less so for the curry rice. Will recommend the matcha latte and hot azuki drink.
4
Would like to try their dessert in the bird cage on our next visit, is look special. We ordered for 2 main dishes + 1 dessert, total bill $52+. Still considered slightly costly to us but affordable as the portions are generous.
3
Dolce offers variety of food. Good venue for friends gathering. Hi tea set is a disappointment though.
4
2 of us ordered a Smoked Salmon Benedict, a Smoked Salmon pizza, Americano and Cappuc. Ya...we are crazy over salmon..haha. Pizza is nice, egg ben is so so only. Cappuccino is lousy, too foamy n the taste is awful. Maybe it's me that it didn't suit me. Service is good.
4
We ordered the Squid Ink Seafood Pasta and the Kurobuta Pork Katsu Omu Rice. Both tasted good, the seafood was fresh and pork was still tender while crispy. The Creme Brulee with Matcha Gelato was also well done. Service staff were nice but the food arrived very late- we waited 30 mins for the pasta and 45 mins for the omu rice
2
Decided to try this restaurant as its menu looked interesting. Ordered squid ink pasta which is a fav with me. It was disappointing and the worse I have tasted. The seafood condition was nice though. Fresh squid and prawns. But the gravy was really not doing it for me. Pasta was average, thinner spaghetti version than I was used to.Ordered a sesame Parfait and it saved my dinner for me. Ice cream was made with real sesame and the green tea powder at the bottom was very fragrant. Jelly cubes was tasteless though. Didn't order drinks. The cost was around SGD 32. The young Cashier girl was not very polite, I just took a second more to dig for coins and she got impatient and reiterated the bill amount. Didn't even say thank you after I made payment. Lousy customer service at the end of the experience. Prior to payment, the service personnel was quite good. Won't be back
4
Although it is a Public holiday, it was not packed and noisy. Food is quite similar to Miam Miam and food presentation is nice.
5
Loved their cheese baked rice with Japanese curry with succulent and freshly fried chicken at $16.80++ . There's service charge but water is self service.
5
And well grilled chicken. Mushroom on Benedicts was flavourful and smells nice. Lots of salads n kale were given
5
Nice food, nice atmosphere, staffs were great too! :) Been there many times and does not disappoint us.
4
Ambience was great. Food wise for starters were marvellous especially their salad and chicken thigh. Pasta was disappointing and expensive, avoid if possible.
1
The food here is usually good and prompt.
Very disappointed this afternoon to have waited for over 30mins for my order.!!
Don't know what happen, coz the staff did not explain nor attempt any service recovery.
4
Had a casual meetup over lunch and this place serves reasonable portion set lunch @ good price. Waitress are prompt to service and food gets served fast.
4
Been to Dolce Tokyo many times. As usual, value for money meals and the chicken is really succulent on the inside and crispy ont he outside. Delicious!

A first timer for me. Looking at the lunch menu, carbonara simply interest me enough to stop over for lunch.A nice set up, as much as I like to rate it GOOD but I can't as it fell short of the following :Very IMPORTANT : never never present both entree n main together.Sadly, unfortunately both entree, mushroom soup n my pasta were presented to me at the same time. I asked the staff. Why ? She pretended not to hear me & left it on the table. Sadly ....Food wise, seriously it was good mushroom soup & tasty pasta.I sat down n ordered at 12.36pm. After both entree n main were served to me like 15 minutes later. My dessert didn't arrive till ...2.15pm. That's when, I request for my sweets. Service : 2/10Food. : 7/10Ambience : 7/1

Was choosing between this restaurant vs another one on the 2nd floor. This one won my heart cos the staff was more friendly.Nice pleasant place with nice pleasant food.1 Starter - Thick cut fries. Decent. Maybe can have other dips besides chilli sauce from the shelf2 Starter - Chicken pop corn. Came with wasabi sauce, my friend didn't like it but I like it though I didn't understand why they used that dip3 Drinks - Home made ice mint red tea. Not bad. The drinks arrived making us thought milk was added. It looked that way cos it's blended4 Drinks - Home made ice yuzu red tea. Same thing as 3 except this has yuzu. If u like the fruit, this is for you.5 Main - DIY combo with fried fritter, pork ribs, ribeye steak. Fried fritter was comforting, steak was nicely cooked to our request. Pork ribs were simply too sweet too our liking. 6 Dessert - Some ice with ice cream on top with mochi and yuzu. Was ok only. Should have chosen the brownie instead. Overall experience was good. Would probably come back for their pork chop.Keep up the friendly servic
4
Nice place to hang out and have a cup of coffee. The staffs were efficient and attentive. Overall it is good.
2
Ate a bowl of raman. The neighbouring customers are seated too close, would be good if there is more privacy.
4
*They have plenty of dishes to serve from appetizer to dessert
*Sick Service
*Food is tasty and flavorful
*Not so expensive as you will have take away
4
Ordered a pork belly burger and a fillet. Portion was good for 2 of us. Love the freshly fried fries. Salad was good too.
4
Set lunches is good value. The chicken is grilled just nice and also go well with the salad especially the grilled tomato.
4
My mom and I went here just for snacks so we ordered the mixed crostini which was good. And for dessert, we ordered the salted egg lava cake which was soooo delicious. And presentation wise was so unexpected, it was on a cage! Maybe the waiter knew my mom was diabetic. Hahaha! Ambiance, price and service was definitely satisfactory.
3
I most often come to this place if I want a good coffee and quick meal. Set lunches are my fave as it affordable. What this resto needs is a service retraining for full timers. Giselle, the Filipino server, is very inattentive and doesn't even look at you when taking order. She lacks even a bit of politeness, with not even a smile when you say thank you to her. It might not be her fault as maybe she doesn't see that her attitude can actually spoil a good lunch/dinner. A service priority or staff retraining can do very well for this place. Luckily, the youngsters of this cafe are well mannered and friendly

The food was amazing 50% off second pasta dish Wednesday was just what we needed after a long day and it didn't disappoint! Pasta was beautiful and you can pick your sauce base, extra points guys! Panacotta was so creamy and the brownie with matcha was just gorgeous!

First time eating at dolce. Wanted to try something new. Their food arent bad. Especially the truffle fries (its the big chunky kinda fries which i love, though portion is limited), their wild mushroom soup (love the display of it) and their chicken thigh (which was very generous in portion and it taste all not too bad, though the sauce portion could be bigger). The carborana there, which was the main reason i went there was a tad too creamy for me. I expected a more watery and mild cream. But it turned out really sticky and creamy. Not sure if thats the intention. But i wasnt too please with it.
2
The kurobuta katsu curry did not taste fantastic, there was not much taste in the meat itself. Two of us who had the curry had upset tummies after and one threw up after. And my sister's niece threw up and had a upset gastric after eating the cheese baked rice.Service was good though.
5
we celebrated my kid's bday at dolce tokyo bugis. food is good and reasonably price. place is nice for family dinner and service is excellent. i used chope vouchers which gave me some discount off the food.
4
Celebrated my wife's birthday here. Came back for their ribs. Delicious and big portion. Overall food is above average. Will definitely come back again...

Grilled Chicken ðŸ’•
Black Sesame Zen
Choose black sesame instead of the normal matcha ice cream. Red bean paste is little too sweet for my liking.
5
Decent affordable food.. I actually like their brunch food. :) And for their desserts.. try the salted lava cake, loving it!
3
Staff didn't find my chope reservation when I reached, although I've made it a day ago and received a confirmation email.
4
Food is nice, but the price abit expensive.they have weekday promotion for 2nd 50%,it's quite value.
4
Prompt reply and follow-up on reservation through Chope and had enjoyed our family dinner very much.
4
I ate at Dolce Tokyo in Nov 2016 and decided to try this restaurant again. They still have their S$10.90+++ set lunch which offers either Pizza, Pasta or a Western meal with a drink - Coffee, Tea or Ribena. Great Value.This time I had the Meat Ball Pizza. Crispy Super Thin crust with flavourful meat balls. Plus Ribena as my drinkWill definately return !

Used to frequent the outlet at Tiong Bahru Plaza but unfortunately they closed it down. Decided to check out the outlet at Bugis Junction. Had my usual pasta and was not disappointed. Love the texture of the spaghetti here, done just right, not like a lot of other places in Singapore which was a tad too soft for my liking.Two reasons why it didn't get a five star from me. 1. The dessert - Red Velvet Lava Cake was way too sweet and really hard. Had expected a soft moist cake which oozes chocolate which cut open. Turn out to be almost rock hard.2. Seriously under-staffed - I know that it's not easy to get service staff but waiting close to 15 min for dinner and had to press the call-button many times just to get some attention is a little too much.We spent about S$60 for 2 pasta dishes, a drink and a dessert which was reasonably good value for the quality of food and it's location
4
Dolce Tokyo in Bugis on the third floor is an interesting restaurant with an Italian/Japanese fusion theme. One of a number in Singapore this is our closest and we get there about once a month. Staff are friendly and helpful but some of them can find English a bit of a challenge so patience is the key. There is a great variety from burgers and ribs to more complex dishes so you should find something to suit your fusion tastes.Prices are reasonable and portion sizes more than adequate
4
I've visited Dolce Tokyo several times and the quality of food has been consistent. The weekday set lunch is definitely value for money.
5
I won't say that the food is terrible because it served Italian cuisine in Bugis. I liked their Genmaicha Tea pot.
5
I highly recommended the DT SIGNATURE COMBO & dessert bento. Try to believe it . Hope you guys enjoy it.
4
We never fail to order our favourite grilled chicken set meal. The service is slow as we dine at peak hours.
5
The staff were friendly and the food served was fast. It's a casual and cosy dining place for an afternoon with friends or loved ones.
4
Ordered the mushroom egg ben, everything is good. Salted egg york lave cake is not as fantastic though, as the filling is not hot and watery enough.
Overall it is good.
5
I guess the shop has made a tiny changes, ordered my usual and the plate was changed, I guess it's better that way. :) Thankful for the service & food.
4
Second visit, still a good one. Food was of reasonable portion and price. Cake was a bit more expensive though. But when it was served with a cage, it was a pleasant surprise. All of us wouldn't mind going back again.
3
Reserved table was at a cosy corner. Service staff was quick to attend to us as every table has a Call Button. My egg ben was too cooked, for my taste. My friend's squid pasta was so too dry, prawns was tasteless. Another friend's roasted chicken was fine.
4
Dolce Tokyo has a great Set Lunch menu which tastes yummy as well as being value for money. IT is a great place to sit, eat, read a book or watch the world go by. The music is modern and not too loud. I will definately go back to eat there again
