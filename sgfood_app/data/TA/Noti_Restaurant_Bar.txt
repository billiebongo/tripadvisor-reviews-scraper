Came here before a flight to kill time. They had very cheap happy hour deals for beer, so we decided to get some food too. Sadly the food we had (calamari, fries) were pretty poor. Nice staff though.
5
Excellent service with attentive staff.
Scallops were abit over cooked and chewy but other dishes ordered were excellent!
Cocktails were nicely done and loved the Tiramisu!
Thanks for helping to charge my mobile. And please keep playing such awesome music. will be returning soon.

Had a night out with the girls here for dinner and drinks. Since it was the second day of CNY it was less crowded as compared to my first visit. To me this is a place to go for home cooked Italian style. No fuss just good food. The crabmeat pasta was my fav. The staff was attentive and Toni was his usual charming self as always. Will definitely be back here again to try out the rest
5
Nice place with sitting outside and able to see the crowd walking.Good food, especially the signature dish, which is a homemade bolognese sauce with homemade pasta, it was very very good...unfotunately i do not remember the correct name of this dish.Gentle and friendly owner
5
Service was good, waitresses were always on hand to help with any requests. The food was delicious (do try the 'sagne', it was amazing and you could really taste the amount of thought that went into making such a seemingly simple dish).Atmosphere was very cozy and intimate, very mych a true candle-lit dinner.

We visited this place with an overseas visitor and were pleasantly surprised with the cosy corner reserved for us. Ordered crab meat pasta, beef pasta and aglio olio as well as BBQ chicken wings and fried risotto balls. For dessert we had tiramisu. The food was very good and portion was just right. Loved the starters, pasta and also the dessert. Service wise, the male server had left a deep impression on us. His service was good and prepared to serve something out of the menu and always smiling with a ready-to-serve attitude unlike another lady server who did not really smile nor speak when we thanked her and paid the bill! Overall it was a wonderful night if not for a couple who probably knew the staff at the restaurant as the couple made a lot of noise talking loudly, squealing, purring etc. which attracted not only her partner's attention but also the customers like us who wanted to enjoy a quiet dinner with our guests. Lastly, I give the male server a 4 star service but owing to the lady server, he overall service has dropped to 3.

Was here for dinner with my wife about couple of weeks back. Very lively place to have dinner and drinks. Foods serving was tasty and great service experience. The owner (Toni) the GM (Patrick) and whole team was friendly and attentive throughout our dinner. Completely worth the effort to come to Noti for dinner. Will surely come again, hopefully soon
5
Noti is located on Club street which is a fun location. The service is very good and the staff are knowledgeable. The restaurant has a great vibe and they can accommodate big groups so one to remember for big get togethers. We were a group of 4 and the big tables near us did not bother us at all. The food was very good and it all feels very authentic. The food is not too fussy but tasty
5
I really like this place; friendly, fun, busy, great service and great food. The food is nothing extraordinary or fancy, just home style Italian cooking at its best. Keep an eye out for the specials, Toni will always let you know what they are. This is a great spot really worth a visit.
4
Went there for the first time and we decided to sit outside. Very nice location to sit and do people watching while enjoying a glass of prosecco. For a starter we shared the mozzarella with toast and prosciutto di parma, followed by pasta with ragout and ravioli with spinach and ricotta. Finally a tiramisu to finish. Nice place, inside there's like 2 very different parts: one is more casual and the other more with tables and white tablecloths and so forth. Will probably go there again. Not fine dining, but good value for money. And oh yes, before I forget: one of the friendliest waiters to serve us ever in Singapore
4
Nice dinning environment, superb taste, we all enjoyed it so much !
will make plan to visit again one day :)
4
Very good Italian food, you almost get the homemade feeling. The deep fried risotto balls are just great. Equally the pasta was beautiful. Good wine-chart with Italian wines.
4
We chose this restaurant from Trip Advisor. We were visiting Singapore prior to connecting with our cruise ship. The staff are very friendly here and the food was delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Noti. Thank you.
5
Very good pasta, make me feel like I'm in Italy.Friendly staff,good food and value for money üéñüéñüéñüéñüéñ

My super mate Toni made us all feeling home. No matter where you are from. Here you feel home. Never take the menu for granted. Ask for the special VIP dishes and he will surprise you. Trust me on that Patrick Pompejo, the manager , is doing a great job pleasing all the special wishes.
5
We liked this restaurant. Maybe there was no big variety of dishes but everything was very tasty, fresh and nice looking. Service was on a very high level. Atmosphere was very good. When my daughter refused to eat the rest of tiramisu they even offered to replace it by another dessert (chocolate cheese cake). I guess cuisine pretend to be Italian, because most of the dishes include parmesan, parm ham, rucola
4
I've been to Noti a few times and food is reliably good. Service too. Only Carlsberg on draft though which is a bit of a shame, but I should probably have been drinking wine anyway.It might not be the #1 best place on the planet but I really can't imagine anyone going here and not walking away satisfied afterwards. Thumbs up from me.
3
Location is nice with outdoor seating. Staff is slow, took ages to even order drinks. Drinks are great and fairly priced however. Food ... if you expect authentic Italian food, I recommend to choose a different place. Oily and tasteless dishes. Salad came with no sauce etc. Disappointing but expensive experience.
5
My Son had a seafood platter which was wonderful, I had steak with mashed potatoes which was equally delicious. Service was relaxed and pleasant, with the waitress being very knowledgeable about the food and wine. Everything was served quickly and professional, over all a very good experience in a pleasant relaxed environment
4
2nd visit to the restaurant. the last visit was many years ago. The service and food are still as good. the boss came out to interact too which was the same as many years ago and that had made an impression to me. Love how the boss love to see his customers enjoying the food and getting feedback.
5
Had to have a Singapore Sling and couldn't have done better. Chef ex Raffles. We both ate exceptional meals and met the owner and Chef.
If you are anywhere near make the effort.
Mike and Shirley

Great place for friends to hangout for some carbo loading. Nothing overly fancy except well executed Italian homecook fares... great place for chill out with friends over reasonably priced wine.
4
Not crazy about the antipasti, but the pasta was top.
I had homemade pasta with ragout, south italy style, it was amazing.
Reasonable price, and nice owner, with good manners and a lot of character.
I would reccomend.
5
We found that the restaurant very cozy for group, unpretentious place but yet sophisticated!
The food was delicious,not expensive. Should definitely try their Belini's!!! üëç

Have eaten in a lot of restaurants in club street but this one i had missed , so was extremely pleaseed when my evening meal came , it was delicious , service was good froma friendly waitress and the ambiance of club street all added to my lovely meal , will definite be going back , this is a lovely Italian styled bar and restaurant with good prices considering where its located , keep up the good work servivce and food qualit
5
I visited Noti at Clubstreet area with my group of friends yesterday.And it's always been a good place to have a dinner and drinks.First of all it was Ladies Night and the drinks is very affordable for $7 and my friends really enjoy having prosecco and cocktail.After that we order the antipasti which is the suggestion of the manager and we are all amazed with the presentation and the taste of the food its very delicious.For the Main we order the special lasagna and lambshank and ofcourse the Mama pasta Sagne the food was so good and its all taste like authentic Italian..Overall experience was all good the service also is one of the best the staff always make sure that everything alright.Me and my friends was enjoyed everything...We will definitely coming back again its a great experience..Good job Noti..

Attending this restaurant last Friday for a team (4 people) Christmas dinner. First of all the menu (both food and drinks) is not extensive. They was really little options to chose from. I have had the chef special of Crispy duck lasagna. It was discussing and left me with a very bad taste in my mouth. I tasted no duck at all and the pasta was very over cooked. It tasted like a poor economy class processed meal. My colleagues were also very disappointed in there meals. Also, the cocktails were also very poor and contained very little of none at all alcohol. Also the service is very poor. I was very shocked by all of this because I visited this restaurant 2.5 years back and remember it been very good which was the reason for my return visit. The pace use to be run by Italians. It now appears to be Singaporeans. The food is so not been cooked by an Italian and if it is then he/she should be fired because they are not qualified to cook. DO NOT EAT HERE. Its overpriced and tasteless food
4
As a break from Asian food this was a great escape, slightly tucked away just continue on along club street and it's in a quieter area but the food is well worth it, friendly staff will serve good value tasty dishes, ours were pizzas for a welcome change and we were not disappointed, thanks
4
Went there with a group of besties who are craving for some hearty Italian fares apart form the usual pizza and pasta that most Italian restaurants are serving in Singapore. If you like true blue Italian homecook food, Noti doesn't disappoint. With freshly made pasta, gnocchi, risotto, Noti stay true to the Italian cooking style without complicating the dishes. Suggest to go there with a group of friends as the portions are quite generous and considering the heavy carbo diet, this is the place to sample different Italian staples in a group setting. Dessert is good as well! Will be back again
5
Stumbled across Noti restaurant while bar hopping along club road during happy hour. With zero expectations we were pleasantly surprised. We ordered the squid whist having a drink but then left to head to another restaurant further down the road. After seeing the absolute ridiculous priced menu at the other restaurant, we decide to head back to Noti. We are so glad we did. We ordered the tasting platter for entree, delicious and for mains I had the gnocchi and my husband had the burger. They also gave us a try of their lasagna, just because! The staff were all amazing and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great evening. My husband was a chef for 16 years and has made gnocchi on a daily basis throughout his career and it's safe to say on our visit they nailed the gnocchi which is very hard for even some chefs to make! I'm surprised to see this is not rated higher on TripAdvisor. If your in the area I definitely recommend dropping by!
3
The music was too loud, definitely not a place for family. Smoking area could have the smoke flow back indoor. Service was so so, perhaps they are not expecting kids. Food was overpriced
5
Warm welcome from Tony at the entrance followed by amazing starters and mains with nice wine and coctails. Well done Tony, keep it up and see you soon! Erich
4
Warm welcome from Toni who encourage us to have a mixed starter platter which was substantial and excellent.
The scotch eggs went down well with my colleague. My main course pasta was good.
The wine was not bad value for Singapore. Service friendly.
4
We really enjoyed our dinner here. The sagne pasta was amazing and the tiramisu was delicious too. Can't wait to go back!
4
The food here is good and i particularly like the beef tagliata. Located along Club Street, you can pub hop along the street after a satisfying dinner. Go on Fridays and Saturdays night (between 7pm-2am) and the street is closed to cars, so the crowd spills over to the road. Nice place to hang out.
4
Dined there on Tuesday night with no expectations, just because the parking lot in front of Noti was empty and the menu looked good. Neither of us were really hungry, so we ordered appetizers - a mozzarella duo, one block breaded and deep-fried, the other caprese style, and a scamorza, which is bacon-wrapped smoked cheese. Both came with a couple of slices of grilled chiabbatta bread. That and a bottle of Pinot noir.The waiter was friendly and the food came promptly.I'd go back and try a full meal
5
I've just moved to Singapore, and accidentally I found a piece of Italy at Noti.Having said that, the food is purely and genuinely Italian quality - hard to find abroad!The wide range of dishes, which I've been trying on a weekly basis, is entirely respecting Italian traditional cuisine along with some experimental dishes. Coming from the same region of the owner, I truly experienced home's taste. The sagne, in particular, reminds me scents and flavours of home - which is honesty pretty special!Toni the owner is extremely friendly, always willing of sharing a glass of red with you, and entertaining you with great stories of his home town. The staff is awesome! Super fast and really welcoming. Love their hospitality! In particular Sherry, the manager, will always help you out in choosing your best choice. Summing up, I found Noti as home, and I will always recommend it for a traditional Italian cuisine experience. 
5
Have been three times and will be going again tonight.Limited but good menu. Personal favourite dish is Sagne Pasta, very authentic Italian bolognaise. The shared platter for entr√©e is also very nice.Have seen mixed reviews about Toni however our experience has been nothing but great! He comes to see us when we dine for a quick chat (without being intrusive) and makes us genuinely feel like valued customers. Last time he even came and gave us complimentary Italian liqueur and had a drink with us!Would recommend giving this honest Italian restaurant a try
5
Every year, since 1992 I come to Singapore for business. Since few years I have discovered Noti: a very good real italian restaurant. The men√π choices are not many but the quality of the food is excellent... and I'm italian..!The cost is not low but not even too expensive considering we are not in Italy and considering the average cost of the restaurants in Singapore.By the end: strongly recommended..
1
Service sucks. Ive been in a lot of bar and restaurant in Singapore but Noti is the most I hate one. I talked to the Manager named Shery to complain about the unaccepted service rendered and rude attitude of their staff. And I was really amAzed when Shery apologizes to me and said that the staff is just a partimer. But wait, its not just a partimer, he isn't a local or a passholder, he is a foreigner looking for a job. How can any of a dining establishment tolerate this cases? So Im calling the attention of #ministryofmanpower to do something regarding this issue
4
Good food, excellent home made pasta - although my lobster with it was slightly overlooked - nice atmosphere and attentive staff and owner
5
Excellent South Italian food, cooked to the owner's mother's recipes. Very tasty without being too fancy. Toni, the owner is a great host and the staff are all wonderful. Highly recommended.
5
We visited Noti during a recent trip to Singapore.The restaurant is situated in charming Clubb St. We enjoyed a fabulous and tasty Italian meal. The service was great and we will definitely go again next time we're in Singapore.
5
Great food made with real love! Delicious Italian, great service, well priced wine - will definitely be back!
2
quality of food do not match with italian taste; meet was not good and price too expensive; same for wine; 70$ for a bottle too much for this kind of wine
3
My wife and I joined another couple for an enjoyable evening at Noti.My homemade, "sagne", fresh pasta was very good however my wife's tagliolini lacked the basil expected in the tomato basil sauce.The service was ok however more than once we felt like we were being passed over. Overall a good night but it really could have been better.
4
Went here for dinner based on trip advisor reviews and were not disappointed. The owner seemed very welcoming although the service was pretty slow in spite of the restaurant not being full.However, the quality of the food was excellent. We had risotto balls and calamari to start both of which were delicious and very fresh. For mains we opted for two different gnocchi based dishes; one with mushrooms and truffle oil, the other with pesto and prawns. These were also very tasty.I'd return for the food but they could do with speeding up their service
5
Came here for NYE with a friend and her hubby along with several of their friends. Set menu including 4-courses and free flowing drinks (exc spirits) for 4 hours. Each of the courses was delicious. Service was excellent, including good banter with the owner. The place itself was quiet but was probably a highlight since NYE can be quite hectic. I'm told it is usually busy most nights of the week. Highly recommend if you're looking for some Italian food during your stay in Singapor

I have spent a great deal of time in travelling and dining across the globe but this breaks the record!My Friend and I chose a table but I wanted to use the toilet first before ordering. I was rudely called out by the owner, he insisted to know where my table is. I told him I was a customer but he insisted on having the dispute and even boldly stated: "This is my house!" I was hungry and also very embarrassed by such uncivilised treatment. I WAS ACCUSED. The bald owner lacked manners and is in no shape to run such a business. Very unbecoming, so I showed him our table and told my Friend we should leave. This restaurant has ruined a nice calm Friday evening.Never will I eat anything from this barbarian owned establishment. #shame #disgustADVICE TO THE OWNER:CLOSE YOUR RESTAURANT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO HAVE ONE
5
We have been to Noti twice now after just walking in one night. Both times the meals were absolutely delicious! The pasta is fresh and perfectly cooked. The staff and owner (?) were VERY cheerful, happy and knowledgable. Both times we left very satisfied and can't wait to take more friends and family there.......maybe we should keep a secret
4
Wonderful taste of Italian cuisine in Singapore. Conveniently located in Club Street. Thank you Chef, we had a great time.
2
Charming Italian proprietor, good choice of wine, and all downhill from there. The appetizer "platter" was something disappointing (the prosciutto was inedible), and my main (salmon, the special of the day) was worse.
5
From arrival to departure our needs and expectations were met. Our reservation was on the books and we were seated at a table good for conversation (a bit away from the street) which suited us perfectly. Our drink orders were taken and we were off....the food was all good. Highlights included the risotto balls, beef cheek and gnocchi. The beef tagliata was a little fatty but still very tasty. The wine list is quite small but well matched to the food. Staff were very attentive and listened to our request to have an extended break between courses. I thought cost was typical mid range Singapore pricing. I am sure we will be back
4
Ate here on my first night alone in Singapore, the service was amazing. Arun made amazing cocktails, I enjoyed them so much I couldn't stop at one. The Singapore sling is the best I've tasted anywhere. Sherry the manager was so friendly and attentive. It was nice to have such great service.The food was also very yummy. You will not be disappointed
5
My wife & I ate here late one evening we had been in the area having a few dinks & fancied a few dishes to share, we ordered bruschetta & a few other small dishes the bruschetta was amazing & the mozzarella balls with dips were also really good. The staff were really nice & we had a nice chat & shared a few laughs. We are looking forward to our next visit to Singapore so we can visit Noti
3
I expected more of this place, the food was not tasty. For this quality of food it is overpriced. The pesto wasn't house made which was also a disappointment. We also ordered the daily special pasta, it was nothing special, quite bland. For 27 dollars a portion, it's not worth it.
5
First time and won't be the last. Authentic italian food served with the warmth, charm and hospitality. We went for the starter platter which came highly recommended by the lovely manager Ms Sherry. It's has a bit of everything from the restaurant all time favourite antipasti. Really enjoyed the rissotto balls and the deep fried calamari. For the main course, its certainly the dishes from their something from Mama - love the handmade sagne and the handmade gnocchi, robust flavours and authetnic taste. The dessert platter is a good choice for trying out again a bit of everything from the dessert menu but hightlight is certainly the lovely tiramisu ! Really good evening here at Noti, good service, all our dishes were delicious. Thanks Noti, will definitely come back again 
4
Noti had received a lot of praise from friends before I visited which might have mis-guided the pre-conceptions I had of the place before I visited. The service is excellent and the prices are reasonable. The overall atmosphere fits well with other restaurants in the Club Street area. The food itself was good in places but let itself down in others. The management there were extremely accommodating though when I wasn't a fan of the main course and for this reason alone you should visit! Quality service is not so common and this place looks after you
5
Excellent execution, simple presentation, this is the kind of food that, as Italian, I love to eat.As a starter arancini di riso, perfectly fried, crispy skin, rice tastefull and not overcook, capsicum sauce perfectly balanced.Gnocchi, clearly home made, sarde sauce was tasty and creamy.Ossobuco, tasty soft but not overcook, nice rosemary fragrance. Im not a mash potato lover, but those where very nice.Dont forget the spriz as aperitive, was a dejavu of my afternoons in Treviso.Well don
5
Was proposed by our hotel to visit Club Street on the weekend for its vibrant alfresco scene. We walked the entire street and were captivated by the crowd and decor & music of Noti restaurant. We had to wait for a while as restaurant was full but it was alright to hang around outdoor to catch the lively action on the street. The food was certainly worth the wait. The owner Tony recommendation was great with the starter platter that we get to try different types of italian antipasti. I really enjoyed the sea bass with prawn bisque with a very generous sized seafood ravioli. Very rich bisque full of flavour,one of the best I have tasted. . My wife loved the hand made sagne pasta with delicious ragout sauce which was made with Tony mum's recipe. The tiramisu is a definitely must too !! Despite a packed restaurant, service was friendly and attentive with a very welcoming owner. Glad we dined here and we will certainly return again when we are back in Singapore. Reservation is recommended if you don't have time to wait
5
staff-awesome, food-delicioso, ambiance-cool
this restaurant is one of the best restaurant i've been too. even if the food is a bit pricey the quality is best. as they dont want to serve a crappy food. *thumbs up*
4
Mama's pasta is incredible! Every visit to Singapore involves at least 1 visit to Noti. The setting on Club Street is great on weekends as the tables line the streets and the people watching is great!
4
The owner recommended my starter & main and I was not disappointed.Noti team make you feel like home. Everything I ordered was great. Service was professional and friendly.I'll be back for sure
4
We had walked down Club St the night before & found some really funky little bars. So we checked Tripadvisor for reviews of a nice restaurant to dine at and found Noti. The service was very good & our drinks were brought to us with haste after some good recommendations, the owner was very friendly and took time to chat to us & make us feel as welcome as possible.The starters were good if unspectacular, we shared a caprese and calamari which was a fair enough portion. The mains on the other hand were fantastic I plumped for the orichiette which was one of the best pasta dishes I've had outside Italy. Overall a great little find at reasonable prices in Singapore terms ($10 a pint
5
Such a great place to sit outside and watch all of the creatures taking in Club Street. There is more formal indoor seating, but we sat outside and had beers with nibbles. The Carlsberg was draught and in pints and is SGD 10 all night so a decent price. We had the calamari, bruschetta and risotti balls which were fantastic.The service is great with very friendly staff, but as the evening winds down you may get accosted by the owner as he patrols the toilets to ensure that only his patrons use them (one of our party got denied usage and he got escorted back to the table to prove that he was with us). It all worked out well in the end as we got a free limoncello!
5
I'm sat in Noti right now having just finished our meal and feeling inspired. The calamari was just okay. The bottle of prosecco ($45) was a little too sweet but cheap. But the mains were spectacular. We had the ragut with homemade pasta and the meat-stuffed eggplant. So much flavor! So balanced! Richness was cut with the perfect level of acidity from the tomatoes. The pasta was perfect. The meat-stuffed eggplant was more like a GIANT meatball. I had to refrain from licking the plate.
5
Had a lovely starter platter of deep fried calamari and cold cuts. Good fresh ingredients , calamari was crispy without being oily. Nice portion just enough without being too much. Really enjoyed the main course - Mushroom risotto. It must be the best I have tasted. The flavour between the truffle oil, the mushroom was perfect . Risotto was perfectly seasoned and al dente. Will certainly return just to have this same dish again ! Also appreciate the good and attentive service by the staff. Being a lone diner, was really nice that they came by every now and then to make sure I am well taken care of. Highly recommended for good food and lovely servic
4
Club street is great place to people watch. Sat outside and relaxed in the Saturday night atmosphere. Menu has good variety of Italian dishes with daily specials. Really tasty. It is not fine dining but doesn't pretend to be. Staff friendly. Thank you Noti, we had a great evening
1
I had made a booking more than a week in advance for a large party and on the eve of the dinner i got a call asking if I still wanted to confirm the dinner reservation . Upon confirming the reservation i also reconfirmed that i needed the table at 9.15pm as booked earlier. When i reached Noti restaurant i was told quite brusquely that i had to wait for 30 to 35 minutes at least. When i said that i had made the reservation well in advance and reconfirmed that evening i was told in no uncertain terms that I was wrong and the reservation had been made for 9.30pm and that i had no choice but to wait. All this in a loud and extremely rude tone and I was left standing in the middle of the room with my children while they went about their business. The tables were full and i could see that there were no tables available . It was evident that they had no intention of giving us a table because at 9.30 he told us that he (the owner of the restaurant apparently) did not want to have us there and that we would have to find another restaurant to go to with our party of ten on a friday night. I have never had such an obnoxious experience
4
I was working in Singapore in November and one of my colleagues really wanted an Italian meal. After searching on TripAdvisor I stumbled across this restaurant, which wasn't too far away from the hotel. We were so glad we made the effort to seek it out.The restaurant was very quiet when we arrived and we were shown to our table and given the menu. My colleague started to converse with one of the staff in Italian and we ended up having a great night, chatting to the staff and eating their recommendations. The food was delicious as was the wine.Would definitely return
4
I enjoyed a lot the food and the glass of wine. just one small disappointment to pay S$7 for a bottle of water that I didn't actually ordered. I just wanted plain water. The waitress was however, kind. The atmosphere was also good.
2
The quality of food is just ok compare with the ranking of the restaurant.
The good is quite expensive for an average Italian food.
I don't think we will return there, there are much better Italian addresses in Singapore for similar prices.
5
Must try this wonderful Italian pasta tipical of south of Italy, with a glass of Negramaro. Italian food, wine and warmth will make you a regular of this place...
4
great atmosphere, great people..authentic Italian food (which I would never expected!!!) and the owner is very welcoming and makes you feel at home.. worth a try!
3
Went for dinner on a Saturday evening. It was quite busy but we managed to get a table without a reservation. Good points: The atmosphere was quite lively and buzzing. Service was very good, waiting staff very friendly and the wine excellent. Dessert was excellent (Mascarpone Cheesecake)Not so good points: We shared the 'cold platter' to start. The selection of meats was very meagre and it was quite expensive ($28++). For mains, I had the Lasagne - it was quite stodgy, dry and a little bland. My wife had the beef cheeks and although they tasted ok there was quite a lot of gristle in the portion. The meal and the wine were a bit on the 'pricey' side.Overall: Restaurant has a great atmosphere and the service is really great. Even though we were a little disappointed with the food we will go back and give it another try
5
I discovered Noti a few months ago after 18 months in Singapore and have frequented the place 3-4 times a week ever since. The food is fantastic, staff are polite and I have even made good friends with the other regulars! Also I am getting slowly educated on good red wine!
5
Had dinner with friends and I may say the food is surprisingly good. had their Baked Aubergine and I love it. It come with a good taste and generous portion of the minced meat. Do come over on Wednesday to get a special offer for drink just for ladies
2
Not a great meal that did not meet our expectations, the owner is nice , a little too much for my taste but nice . We've been to a few italian restaurants around the same area and this one had the "worst" food ! The pasta Carbonara had no taste , the arucola salad apart from the arucola that tasted good the tomatoes had no taste , cucumber no taste ... and so on ! Italian style food yes but not italian food with tasty products for sure ! I can't say that it was bad , however it was not good neither and knowing 2 other great italian just next door where we go often we will not be coming back.Another problem was : the difficulty to get the attention of the waiters after we ordered when we needed water or else
5
Having seen one or two less than favourable recent reviews of this place, I had better get my contribution in quickly! Noti is a great place to visit, with friendly service and good food. Perhaps not everyone appreciates that when you go to an Italian restaurant (no matter what country you are in) you are actually going to a party, and as with any party you should do your bit to make the evening a success. For me, that always starts with calling ahead and booking a table rather than wandering in off the street. By doing that you are paying the restaurant a compliment and they will be extra pleased to see you. Even if it's a slow night, booking a table always seems to make a difference.When we went in early February, we had just arrived in Singapore from London and decided on Noti from Tripadvisor reports. We love Italian restaurants because they are easy places in which to relax, and Noti was no exception. We had a great time. Food was excellent, service also, and we had plenty of laughs. The whole evening was great entertainment. Of course you can always find faults if you try hard enough, but if you are realistic and go with the right attitude I don't see how you can fail to enjoy an evening at Noti
1
We waited about an hour for our food to arrive only to receive a mediocre meal that did not meet our expectations. The food portions were small- especially considering the prices. The portions were so light in fact that my husband and I went to another restaurant close by to complete our meal. When we tried to make the waiters aware of how long our food was taking to come out, we had to constantly try to get someone's attention and no effort was made to make it right. A very bad experience over all
3
I ordered the mushroom risotto and my friend, the orecchiette with pork and mushroom. While we enjoyed the main course, we found the taste of the cold cut a tad raw and the cheese was rock hard. I'm really not sure if that was how it was supposed to be but it wasn't enjoyable. Can't complain about the service even though we didn't feel comfortable or well taken care of. Staff were busy and it was hard to get their attention. My friend felt quite uncomfortable there actually.I would return for the food, but little else. 
1
It was a busy and bustling Friday night as usual on Club street and a few of us were looking for a chilled out place to have dinner and drinks. We walked past Noti and thought we would check it out. It was a busy night for them so it took them a few minutes to seat us which was perfectly fine..but things didnt go well after being seated. It took about 10 minutes for someone to bring us the menu. We ordered some wine and water and was looking at the menu for food...we were ready to order in 5 minutes but it took the waiter sometime to come to us...(which was fine as well...it was a busy night and no fault of the waiter at all) but when he did come back to us..there was NO wine..NO water and he then said the kitchen closes in 15 minutes so quickly order your food. We had been waiting there for almost 20-25 minutes with nothing given to us even after ordering drinks and we were abruptly told to order food (and the first guy did not mention that the kitchen was closing soon)...being upset my friend asked to speak to the manager/boss...and someone else comes and tells us the same thing and starts getting defensive and says we can leave if we want to which is what we did! But this was a blessing in disguise because we had dinner at a FANTASTIC restaurant on Ann Siang Hill after that!

My wife and I wandered down Club Street looking for a place to eat and came across this place and decided to give it at try ......The food is pretty good and the service is friendly and attentive ........ my only complaint was that there was a lot of shouting to the kitchen staff and also very loud talking by Toni the owner....... I did tell him and he was so apologetic and nice about it he made me feel bad for complaining ! He is an excellent host (as he describes himself) and makes a pretty mean Tiramisu .....Well worth a try and I will go back and try other food on his menu
2
We sat outside on the recently pedestrianised Club Street. Great spot for people watching and a nice cool night. Drinks were ordered - some arrived and some did not. We were encouraged to order a platter of starters. I say "encouraged", but I am sure there was an edict to push the platters! It was however very good and there was plenty of food for 4 of us. In fact some of our party were no longer hungry after the substantial platter. We ordered a range of meals. I ordered some pasta (aglio olio) that was bland and cold. I ate less than half. The waitress asked if it was ok when she came to collect it. No, it's not good, was my reply. Nothing, not even a flicker from the waitress. We ordered several other drinks through the night, some arrived and some did not. It wasn't a particularly busy night, but they were clearly understaffed. Food was mediocre at best, service was poor, experience was disappointing tbh. There are better places on club street

We chose to eat at Noti for my Dad's birthday based on positive TA reviews and a quick skim of the menu online to check the selection and approximate prices. Weoverall enjoyed our evening and the meal. The restaurant had a nice interior and atmosphere and there were multiple options on the menu that we had to toss up in order to make our selections. The owner/chef Toni came over and introduced himself which was good fun, although I have to say he had a few cheeky tricks up his sleeve that resulted in us ordering more food and spending more than we otherwise would have. We don't usually order starters but he offered to put together a bit of a tasting plate for us with a selection of starters, which we agreed to. When it came out it was huge and delicious but I immediately thought 'I wonder how much this will be, we should have asked first' - the answer was $98 which we found out when the bill came. We thoroughly enjoyed the platter but wouldn't have otherwise ordered pretty much every starter on the menu and were then a little on the full side for our mains (which were also nice). The other little trick was with the wine - there was a bottle already on our table which we asked about, and before we could really say anything else, Toni opened it up to give us a taste saying that if we didn't like it he would drink it himself. It wouldn't have been the one we would have otherwise chosen (and was probably $20 more than we would have picked) but it was a bit hard to say no once it was open so we just went along with it. So overall we had a lovely evening and enjoyed our meal, but with the starters, wine and additional 17% (10% service charge and 7% tax) added to the bill at the end, we ended up paying quite a lot more than we anticipated but we were happy enough to go along with it given we were in a celebrating mood and these things seem to happen a fair bit in Singapore. Our fault for not paying more attention to detail

Expectations will run high the minute you step into Noti. It is very well decorated to give you a very nice cozy feel. Service staffs are friendly and attentive. Food, I would rate it few notches above average. It's a good place to chill with friends.Guaranteed to have an enjoyable time
5
I visited Noti's last night with a buddy of mine Dev because he knows the Chef, Toni, from his days in Hyatt Singapore. I saw his Facebook post of Noti and just got to go there. Located in Club street it has nice ambiance to it with outdoor seating available where we sat. Dev recommended the sane as he said this is excellent, and the other dish we ask Toni what would he want us to eat. He served us the Sagne and the Orecchiette, which in my opinion is the best pasta dishes I have had. the pasta is home made with Toni's mother recipe from South Italy. The Orecchiette is especially superb because I didn't know the name of the dish before and was guessing what that was but I can not stop eating! It was that good! we sat and had some Champagne before we ordered the stuffed aubergine. While we were sipping champagne, Toni asked us to taste an new dish not on the menu yet, which is a vegetarian Lasagna. and that is just so awesome. it has egg plant that balances the cheese and the sauce that makes excellent taste. it was just an awesome experience and that is the best Italian food I have had in years. Thanks Toni for the splendid culinary experience and Dev for bringing me there

Had high expectations based on TA rating and what we'd heard from others. Certainly the owner puts himself 110% into making an enjoyable experience. Mamas food is undoubtedly the best choice. Wine reasonably priced for Singapore. But just didn't reach the sales pitch for food quality and atmosphere. Problem is there's so much choice even in the street.
5
Club Street was on our travel agenda in singapore. We decided on Noti from the lovely colourful party vibe and decor as well as the lively crowd in the restaurant. We selected the New year's eve set dinner. Enjoyed all the generous 5 course dinner . Delicious Italian food with good authentic flavours. The staff was helpful explaining to us the menu. Special thanks to Ms Sherry for her great attitudfe and constant assistance which made our evening here very special on this very special night of the year. It was a memorable dining experience of good food, warm hospitality by the staff and guests alike.As promosied to the owner, we will certainly return this year to try out the tradition pasta dishes from the regular menu
5
We chose to have dinner inside Noti rather than one of the sidewalk tables on Club Street, which looked perfectly nice. The dining room was a quiet, modern softly-lit renovation of an old shophouse. The cozy atmosphere, pleasant service and delicately prepared salmon and vegetables made for a very enjoyable evening
4
Lovely restaurant set out of the way with a great vibe. They were setting up street dining while we were there, as in on the road, not just kerbside!
Service was great, food was very nice and the dessert (Tiramisu) was sensational.
5
I travel 200 day per Years, I never eat on Italian restaurant as i eat in Singapore. Decor was upmarket and there was a pleasant atmosphere. Food was task and service from owner and waiters was attentive and friendly. I would eat there again
4
After reading the reviews, I had high expectations and was not disappointed.
Set in a lively Street, decor was upmarket and there was a pleasant atmosphere.
Food was task and service from owner and waiters was attentive and friendly.
I would eat there again.
5
Following TA suggestions my colleagues and I, decided to join this place.
What to say...leaded by a REAL italian chef (Tony) every dish carries the real taste of italian food.
a MUST for the italian food lovers in Singapore!!
See you soon Toni! ;)
5
If you are a pasta lover, Noti Restaurant is the perfect place for you. Good service and nice ambiance for dining. Perfect place for couples to enjoy their meals.
5
Wonderful evening mid way of partying and eating with the famous TonyNoti added original Fiorentina meat to menu: my two friends did not hesitate to pay the price for this delicious piece of ItalyFor the italian in town: the place to connect and make friends in Singapore, while eating as at home!...the whole surrounded by the animations of Club StreetOutdoor seating all time, but best on fridays and saturdays, when the street is closed to car
2
Food is so-so, not much disappointment, but not amazing/surprising at all. Heavily overpriced. A sea food pasta with five shells and three prawns cost S$30. A lamb roast leg is S$41. A tiramisu is S$12. The price does NOT include 7% tax AND 10% service charge, although I do not think there is any kind of decent service. So merely two main courses plus a tiramisu costed S$98. Not worthwhile at all. You can enjoy MUCH MUCH better food and service for a bit more dollars at Etna. I would neither come back nor recommend this place to others
5
just one thing to say , go and try the freshly made pasta dishes and you know why this lovely restaurant has good reviews. I have been coming here for last 18 months and it's still my favourite by farToni and crew are superb hosts as well 
5
The night started on a great tone as we were warmly welcomed into the restaurant by the owner Toni. We had the starter platter which was a selection of the restaurant's signature antipasti like Italian cold cuts , calamari . First impression was the sumptuous and generous serving that despite we have to share the platter, there was more than enough for everyone and every item was done nicely . We had the handmade pasta with ragout and hand made gnocchi as well as seafood platter. Again, the food was fresh with authentic rich Italian flavours. The dessert platter is a must with the different signature desserts. We love tiramisu made with Toni's sister own home recipe ! A lovely, homely restaurant for good, authentic Italian food, good attentive service as well as enjoying the historical charm of Chinatown in Singapore. Recommended
5
We went here to recover from a lot of Asian food, which is also delicious but we were craving for some good Italian food. Our taste buds were massaged with every meal, we had a salad and one of his mothers recipes, it was so great! Oh and the owner is very rude and arrogant
5
Went here with my family and was made to feel very welcome,
Great decor and atmosphere.
Anti pasta selection was amazing.
Mains were lovely.
Would recommend
3
We went here with high expectations due to the high rank, but it was nothing special. The food is just good and service is also oke. But again, nothing special...
3
The music was loud and booming, so was Toni and the pesto sauce was drowning my gnocchi!.
The chocolate cheesecake was pretty good though. Ok, but wouldn't rush back. Service was pretty awful.
4
We went to Noti's last night to try out the handmade gnocchi we've heard so much about and it truly was sensational! It was flavorful and the portion's just right for someone with a normal appetite, although, the prawns were kinda tiny. The ambience in the restaurant is quite charming, in a romantic kind of way, and the jazzy music they were playing last night perfectly complemented the overall feel of Noti's. Another notable thing about the place is the warmth of the staff, especially Chef Toni, who went from table to table, greeting the customers and inquiring about their day - and the food. Pretty sweet, if you ask me. I wish though that they have better wine selection and that they pour a little bit more for the price that they charge per glass
4
We sat outside, the weather was kind enough that evening.We me Toni, the owner and head chef, a funny and engaging guy.Took his recommendations of Knochi with Pesto and handmade pasta (by his Mother) with an amazing ragu of port and tomatoes.All accompanied but a good Italian wine.Thoroughly enjoyable evening of great food and great staff.
2
We were looking for something else apart from Chinese as we had already spent quite a few days in Singapore and all previous meals were Asian.A bit disappointed! "Pasta with squid ink & seafood" was recommended as their "today's special". But what came was black pasta (claimed to be made of squid ink) with frozen mini shrimp in tomato sauce. Maybe we misinterpreted what the waiter was suggesting!!!! The price was not friendly either
2
Three of us went expecting a wonderful authentic Italian experience due to great reviews but unfortunately, Noti did not live up. Not only was the music dreadful and loud (Queen/Oasis etc which I like but not with my pasta!) but the bottle of white wine we ordered was warm and the waiter didn't seem to understand white Sauvignon Blanc should be chilled. Moving onto food, we all ordered the same starter of Duo of Mozzarella (boring, I know). It tasted like the mozzarella had come from Fairprice and had never heard of Italy. It was hard and chewy and the the accompanying focaccia was dry and tasteless. The mains we ordered were all fine but nothing to rave about (ravioli, stuffed aubergine, spaghetti) but we were already over Noti by this point. Sad as we were really looking forward to it but certainly won't be returning
3
This restaurant came very highly rated and I was looking forward to our dinner but overall was not blown off my feet. I thought the food tasted authentic but the plating and presentation needed improvement..The parma ham was soggy but the risotto balls was tasty. the grilled salmon with vegetables was not that great. The salmon was over cooked and felt chewy and hard. The burger was awesome but the wedges were over fried. The mushroom risotto was nice with the walnuts as a nice surprise.. The wine list was pretty mediocore and over priced. Rizal was our maite de and is very freindly and was great in helping us order. The espresso tiramisu was definitely unbelievable and one of a kind.. All in all I dont think I will go back againn
5
An enjoyable dinner in this charming restaurant. It has a chic modern atmopshere but the food is totally traditional and delivers an authentic flavour with that warm home cooked feel. We had the traditional 'mama' dishes like the handmade pasta and gnocchi. true to italian tradition, The texture of the pasta was firm to the bite and they were perfect complimented by the rich sauces with lovely italian flavours. Also had the seafood platter which was a good size portion with fresh calamari, fish, lobster grilled perfectly. Had the dessert platter to share so that we could try out the different home made desserts though the tiramisu was our favourite ! Service was attentive and price was reasonable. Lovely location along a charming traditional street of old shophouses. A good resturant to recommend for good food, good service in a charming location
4
Luckily we did not changed our mind to change the dining place for celebrating our dearest friend's BD...Our first time dining there and sure there will be more chance to come. Number of dining places are under category of Once and Enough...With Noti...Once isn't enough. Asking for special arrangement to celebrate friend's BD with honest feeling of expect to have small pc of cake...Noti has given us Not only Small pc of Cake but various kind of Cakes on one dish..blown us and BD lady away...A big THANK YOU from all 4 of Us.
5
Went in Noti all along for a year: perfect ambiance, customized food, unique and authentic Italian owner
5
Very personalized and friendly service. We ate as recommended some antipasti and excellent pasta and lasagne, which was simply excellent. Nice contemporary restaurant interior. I will certainly come again.
5
Great atmosphere. You are being entertained and all staff is really friendly. From chef to the servers, the entire experience was superb.
2
Went to noti and was very disappointed. Food was average Italian fare - no better than a local Italian.Service was poor - though the two blonde ladies on the next table seemed to get much more attentive service from the manager. Clearly I was not his type...
5
Noti is perfect place to have an authentic Italian dinner in Singapore! Food was simply amazing. We had tree course meal with antipasti as a starter (highly recommended!), risotto as a main course and tiramisu as a dessert. All were delicious! Price for the food was very reasonable, definitely not too expensive. Staff was more than friendly and owner Toni is very nice guy. Real Italian with great attitude! He even introduced us for some of his friends with whom we ended up having a great evening. I can definitely recommend this place if Italian food is what you're looking for
1
We went there with 8 persons to have dinner. As the music was too loud to hear each other, we asked them to put the music down. They did so, only to see Toni the manager put the volume up 10 minutes later. We tried to bear with the loud volume, but my father in law couldn't hear anything. Then it all repeated itself: the volume went lower, only to see Toni increase the volume again 10 minutes later. As such, the birthday dinner turned into a highly annoying evening.Secondly, some portions are really small, such as the risotto (less than half the quantity of most dishes)
5
My second time to this hidden pearl in Singapore, Noti is just an amazing place serving honest Italian food and it doesn't really get any better. Toni the owner is the most passionate chef/owner I have ever met and his wife is just amazing and super friendly. I will def be back next time in Sing
4
not an extensive list of menu but served with great authentic italian food. LOVE the rocket salad and Tiramisu! was celebrating my bday that night and received a nicely designed dessert platter from Noti, very sweet and thoughful of the owners :)) lights were dim inside though, overall recommended place to dine if you are looking for authentic italian food served by italians in singapore
5
A trendy restaurant is located in Chinatown within old Chinese shophouses. The walk there from the main road is lovely as the entire street is closed to traffic on weekends. Had the 1.5kg florentine steak to be shared with friends and it was certainly a highlight of our dinner ! The meat was well seasoned and a very generous portion enough for us all. Also had the handmade pasta, gnocchi and seafood platter. Food was tasty with a true authentic flavor of south Italy.. The service was friendly and helpful. The friendly owner came by once in a while to chat with us about his food which does give the restaurant a homely feel. We also had the dessert platter to share and again a hearty portion enough for all. Had our after dinner drinks at the outdoor section as it has a lovely view of the lively street filled with people. We had a good experience here. Good restaurant to visit for good authentic Italian food, good service and experience the tropical charm of Singapore Chinatow
3
We got 2 glasses of red wine, an appetizer, 2 main courses and a tiramisu for dessert for $141, so not too bad for Singapore, but still pricey. The food was excellent. I got the gnocchi with tiger prawns, which was yummy, as well my husbands beef. The wine was good. The tiramisu was a little innovative and it wasn't my favorite. The risotto balls appetizer was YUMMY!! As the meal began, the service was fine (around 8pm), but then the owner got kind of stressed and started yelling loudly, which was a little upsetting for us as diners. The service declined noticeably as soon as he started yelling, and it took about 15 minutes for them to process our credit card when we tried to pay our bill. We're going to try some other places before we choose our go-to Italian on Club Street, mostly because of the owner's loud yelling, which was upsetting for us. I recommend going, but go for an early dinner (6:30? 7:00?) before the owner stresses out all the waiters
4
Located in the middle of club street, this small restaurant offers authentic, tasty Italian food. Service and atmosphere are great. Definitely worth a try.
5
Noti is a cozy Resturant and serves great and variable cuisine. Good ambiance. Loved it. Good wine collection. Recommend the shared starter platter and red snapper.
4
The restaurant served a great starter plate for us which has everything on the venue. and I had a very, very nice and extremely well prepared lamb shank while my lady colleagues loved their parma salad.We were meeting tell very late and was really happy to get such great food at 23:30 in An Siang Road in Singapore (one of the good pub streets) and which cost much lower than we initially expected
4
We had dinner for 2 at Noti, we tooked 1 buschetta to share as a starter (well served, 6 pieces), 2 pasta, 2 glasses of one, one soft drink and one large bottle of water for 140$ - not really cheap. Nevertheless, the food was very good (it is still pasta but apparently in Singapore it has to be expensive), the atmosphere inside is very cosy and the place well decorated, service is nice and there is a few tables on the terrace if you prefer eating outside. Nice place 
5
Was recommended here by our Italian friends here. Was good to come on the weekend to have a stroll along the beauitful Club Street lined with old chinese shophouses. Have been to many italian restaurant around the world but unlike the usual rustic Italian setting, Noti felt different with its trendy decor, music and a very modern yet cosy vibe. However the food is every bit traditional , authentic italian. Toni the owner came to serve us with true south Italian hospitality. We selected from the Mama recipes as per his suggestion. The sagne pasta was delicious with a rich ragout sauce. Also had a selection of the signature starters to share. The highlight of our dinner was definitely the 1.5 kg florentine steak, seasoned and cooked perfectly, juicy and tender ! Good good, good service, friendly atmosphere. Will definitely come back agai
5
Title : Lovely Italian food in ChinatownEnjoyed the authentic Italian food , lovely ambience in this charming restaurant in Chinatown. Its our first visit here as a group so we appreciated that the owner,Tony was very helpful with the menu recommendations. We were happy with the various suggestions from the starter to the pasta main courses, which were made with his mum traditional home recipes. The starter platter consist of a selection of popular starters which was good for a group like ours. For the mains, my favorite was the handmade sagne pasta with the rich robust ragout sauce and velvety texture of the pasta. The gnocchi with prawns pesto sauce is also a refreshing dish, different from the usual tomato based pasta dish. The dessert platter which was great as it allowed us to try out all the different signature desserts from tiramisu to a classic cream custard pie, again made with tony√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mum recipe. In addition the food, what was memorable is the homely, personal touch to the dining experience as toni and his team made us felt like home. Will certainly return again
5
I brought a friend visiting from Italy, and I told him a knew a good place. The bet was that if he was not fully satisfied I would have paid. Long story short: he paid. We shared the sagne, which they have recently "retouched" being slightly thinner whilst retaining that excellent texture. We tried the saltimbocca (new addition), and whereas is often easy to over or under cook them, they were perfect in my view: slightly crisp outside and moist at the same time. The wine list is now upgraded win excellent wines like Gaja. Or that was a special treatment for us? Well, again 2 italians out of 2 were fully happy, service included which gave the right amount of attentions without being too invasive. One only thing, not so good was the ashtray, which I requested to empty, but luckily that was not food or part of the dining experience
4
Overall the food was good but service was slow and definitely needs to improve.Wines are a bit on the pricey side.Had a few appetizers and all were delicious especially the risotto balls. Main course-the risotto & beef cheek were excellent, but stuffed aubergine was not that good
1
- Waiting time only for ordering 20-25 mins- manager made fun of long waiting time. He just blamed us for not having booked a table in advance- tiny portions - gnocci with tiger prawns as a main course (27$ net) is served with 3 tiny prawns and few gnoccis.- after having asked the manager about the prawns he answered that they have always served it like this and will always do. Then he walked away.- they didnt return the change. We had to ask for it! Unbelievable.All in all this was my worst restaurant experience in singapore. The service is super bad and the manager rude. I highly recommend to AVOID this place
5
Had dinner there last night with overseas business colleagues. Total of 7 people and had chosen the restaurant based on tripadvisor recommendations and our evening was certainly a great success. It's not the largest menu in town but everything presented gave the feeling of having been prepared with good traditional family recipes behind them. An extensive wine list and not too pricy. But the real star is the owner Toni. He made us all feel like we were special guests in his home, using first names like we were old friends and generally ensuring nothing was left missed from our experience. I have never written a review before and was only compelled to do so because of the enjoyable experience we all had. I would definitely recommend this place and I'll definitely be back. Thanks Toni
5
TONI made us felt very comfortable ever since we stepped in. The atmosphere was outstanding(lights,decor, etc... As it was our first visit, Toni organized a splendid appetizer while we were deciding on our main course. We were surprised to receive 4 glasses of champagne when he learnt that we were celebrating our anniversary (Nice touch)! You will have to trust his MAMA!! You will never regret with TONI‚Äôs recommendation on the main course (MAMA‚ÄôS RECIPE). All the team members were very friendly in entertaining my 1 yr old son which gave us a great space to enjoy our dinner. My son loved the pasta which was specially made for him. Just when we taught to call it a day, he again brought a huge dessert platter. I really loved the Tiramisu!. My wife whispered in my ears‚Äù I LOVE YOU‚Äù as we were leaving NOTI. We could not stop talking about the great experience we had at NOTI till we reached home Special thanks to Toni, Winnie and the entire team member not forgetting the chefs for a fabulous night. Miss you guys‚Ä¶Vijay & Gawr
5
When thanking my friends for joining me, I described my birthday night at Noti as perfect. The setting, ambience, food and service from the staff are all of excellent quality. We all thoroughly enjoyed our evening and adored the delicious food on the tasting plates and meals served. Toni and his team could not have been more accommodating for us. Our night at Noti was a truly a fantastic experience. We will be back again very soon
3
It was my third visit, previous two were good, tasty and very reasonable price. This time though it seemed the kitchen lost our order because it took forever to get our food and despite apologies from staff, we felt like it ruined our evening. I think they offered a free glass of wine but it was too little too late.
5
We wanted to have an Italian dinner for the evening. Decided on Noti from the many good reviews on Trip Advisor and it was also located in Singapore's chinatown which we were planning to visit. Really happy with this experience as our dinner was really pleasant. The restaurant is withing these old chinese shophouses that lined the street. We made a reservation for 2 and the manager gave us a lovely romantic table at the corner. The cuisine is Italian using the traditional dishes of the owner's family in Italy. We had the risotto balls, bruschetta recommended by the owner. Also had the beef tagliata and the gnocchi pesto which was delicious. Had the dessert platter so that we try out the different desserts as we were indecisive on which one to order. The owner and staff were helpful and the atmopshere was friendly and cosy. Had a good evening here. Good food, authentic Italian favour. good service. Recommende
5
Started off as a formal business dinner but ended up to be a jovial evening of good food and good company, Our company pre booked a set menu of signature starters, pasta and main courses Despite a full restaurant, our food arrived in a timely manner. The servings were good with more than enough to go around our group. Each dish was well prepared, well cooked with an authentic flavour and taste. I particularly enjoyed the fresh made sagne pasta ragout and the minced meat aubergine had a true home cooked as the dishes were made from the owner's home recipe. The dessert platter was a good recommendation as we got to eat the different home made desserts. The owner came by several times to talk about the dishes, their origins and even shared fun little anecdotes on south italian cuisine and his hometown. Truly enjoyable evening with a perfect balance of good food, good service , friendly surroundings in a charming restaurant. Recommended. Great on weekends as the street is closed to traffic and yo get to enjoy the beautiful alfresco dining and vibrancy of the entire street
5
Have always noticed a lively crowd at the restaurant whenever I passed it after work. Finally dceided to give it a try with colleagues after work on a Friday night. As the street is closed to traffic on weekends, we had reserved our pre dinner drinks at the outdoor section first. Its a good spot for peple watching, to see the street gradually get lively. For dinner we moved indoors. We had the Italian starter platter to share followed by grilled seafood platter and handmade pasta ragout. Portions were a good size, good quality food with an authentic Italian home cooked feel. The friendly owner came by to talk to us about his cusinine which is from his family's recipes fom the south of Italy. For dessert, w ehad the dessert platter which is great for a group to share as you get to try the different home made desserts, made fresh for the day. Fabulous tiramisu !. Despite a packed restaurant, we had an enjoyable evening here. Good food, good service in a cosy trendy restaurant. Will certainly come by here more often 
5
Decided to try out a different Italian restaurant. Selected Noti based on the many good reviews on trip advisor. The owner was indeed very friendly. As we said its our first time, he guided us through the menu which were from traditional dishes made by his family from southern italy. We had the starter platter of cold cuts, bruschetta , a few pasta dishes and osso bucco to share. Was good we shared as they were hearty portions. Particularly enjoyed the handmade pasta which was nicely cooked and went very well with the sauce. The dessert platter was also a good choice with different types of home made cakes and tiramisu. We had an enjoyable evening here with the owner occasionally joining us for a drink. The food was good, authentic. Good friendly service. Its our first visit here, will certainly be followed by more to come 
2
After reading all these amazing reviews, we went there for a romantic dinner, which was quite average to our surprise. Portions were small, so after appetizers, entrees, desserts, and drinks we left the restaurant still hungry. We waited for 20-25mins for our meals, To top that, the waiter mixed up my order and insisted that it was my fault. He was not rude, but insisting it was my fault and not apologizing was unexpected. I kept the meal as i didn't want to wait another 20-25mins. It didn't leave a good impression -- sometimes just an apology would do
5
Chef Toni and team are doing an amazing job serving authentic honest Italian "home-food" in totally relaxed surroundings paired with friendly, yet highly efficient service. It doesn't get much better than this in Singapore and is a MUST try for anyone looking for a great Italian meal in Singapore
5
Its been ages since we visited Club Street and our friends insisted to show us the new club street and their favourite Italian restaurant there. Club street is now closed to traffic on the weekend and we enjoyed the walk pass the old Chinese shophouses which are now restaurants & bars to Noti. The restaurant was busy but we were quickly shown to our table by the friendly manager. We had the deep fried calamari and cold cuts for starter and for the main courses, we had the pasta ragout and gnocchi pesto and the seafood platter to share. . We particularly enjoyed the handmade pasta with ragout which the owner explained that it was unique to his region in the south of Italy and handmade fresh everyday at Noti. The gnocchi in pesto sauce and prawns was also a lovely , refreshing contrast to the gnocchi we normal here in our regular italian restaurants. The seafood platter was fresh and well seasoned. We were very happy with the food we had here. The dishes were authentic, rich in flavours with fresh ingredients. The tiramisu came highly recommended by our friends and it is definitely worth a try. We appreciated that the owner came by to explain to us the origins of his dishes which made the dining experience more personal and enjoyable. Overall a good experience of good Italian food, good service and lovely restaurant ! Will be back
5
My wife and I had dinner at Noti last evening. Very good experience. Arucala salad followed by gnocchi for me and lamb shank for her. Polished off with a bottle of chianti. Tiramisu was excellent. Service was great. Solid place to go in Singapore.
5
Been here a few times with friends so we decided to bring my family here as from all our previous experiences at Noti, it has always been consistent in terms of food, quality and service in each of our visits and this latest visit has left us all with once again a great experience. Despite a full restaurant that evening, Toni is always ever so friendly , stopping at tables to share with his guests stories about his family, hometown and the food from the region of south Italy. We have our usual starter platter as its good for sharing and we took Toni's recommendation of the specials for the day which included the seafood skewers and the Osso Bucco as well as our favorite which is the sagne pasta with ragout sauce and lobster linguine which were all cooked perfectly. My parents were often spoil for choices of good Italian restaurant in Melbourne and I am so glad and much relieved that they enjoyed all the dishes they had at Noti. My mum loves the tiramisu here and she does set high standards for tiramisu !Once again, we felt like coming home for dinner with the warm hospitality of Toni and his team as well as the authentic Italian food of Toni's mama ! Shall certainly come back again with my family before they go home to Melbourne

We decided on Noti because of the many good reviews we read about it on Trip Advisor. Was good that our hotel made a reservation for us as when we arrived despite being a week night, it was almost full. The restaurant is inside an old chinese shophouse whereby the entire street is filled with such old lovely shophouses converted in bars and restaurants. The staff was friendly and attentive. The owner, Tony attended to us personally as we mentioned it was our first visit. Tony helped us with the menu and recomemned a few dishes made with his mum's recipes. For starters, we had the risotto balls which were cripsy on the outside with creamy risotto rice filling. Then we had the hand made gnocchi with pesto and sagne pasta ragout. It was our first time having these dishes and we the taste, flavour and the texture. For desserts, we tried out the promegranate panna cotta which was lovely with the right consistency.Each dish we had was authentic and tasty. reminded us of those delicious Italian food we had when we were in Italy. Will certainly recommend Noti for its delicious authentic Italian food, reasonable price and friendly service. Thank you Tony ! We will be back

Was here with friends for a birthday celebration. Despite frequent visits to numerous Italian restaurants in town, quite a few dishes at Noti were new to us as they came from the south of Italy from the owner's home recipes. We were glad we tried them as they were recommended so enthusiastically by the friendly owner. We had a starter platter with different types of cold cuts and the risotto balls which was really tasty. We shared our main courses comprising of different types of pasta which were all cooked perfectly. We particularly liked the homemade pasta with the rich meat ragout and the gnocchi. Besides the pasta, we also shared the grilled seafood platter which was fresh and well seasoned. We also shared the dessert platter which was fabulous with the restaurant's signature home made desserts made with the owner's family recipes. In general, the food here is authentic, with lovely flavours. the service here is personal, attentive with a nice friendly vibe. Despite a full house, the staff even came to sing us a birthday song. truly felt at home here with the homely food and friendly attention. Will certainly come back again to try out the other dishes in this charming restauran
2
We visited this place before and it was more than ok, this time after immediate starters of cold cuts we waited 40 mins after protestThe pasta we received was under cooked(and really not just al dente) the source inadequate , broccoli was over cooked ... Really nothing exciting , it you google these recipes you can make better food at home A little tip Toni should be back in the kitchen or sack the chef and find someone who cares about foodStupidly we went back coz all the other places were booked in advance and we was hungry Perhaps the writing was on the wal
5
Noti will certainly become our new favourite Italian restaurant.It was our first time here with a group of friends and we were very happy with the entire experience from the food to the service. The owner came to explain about the dishes. We had the starter platter which was a selection of cold cuts, risotto balls and deep friend calamri. We ordered a few dishes of pasta to share as well as the Osso Buco. The food were authentic especially the sagne pasta, the Osso Buco was cooked perfectly and so tender.The portion were hearty, and filling. As recommended by the owner, we had the dessert platter to share which consist of different types of desserts. Again, it was amazing and delicious. We had a good evening here, it was friendly, with good food, attentive service, trendy vibe and the owner was very hospitable . Will certainly come back agai

We are always on the hunt for Italian food in any city we are in and we are glad we found Noti ! Our family in Singapore brought us here. It was a weekend and the road was closed. Was amazed to see the street filled with people dining al fresco along the street. The vibe was lively with lovely view of the old chinese shophouses here. The restaurant was packed but we were quickly shown to our seats. Toni the owner came to greet us and introduced the menu to us. We selected the traditional dishes which toni mentioned was made with his mama recipes. The dishes were authentic and rich in flavor. Was surprised to find the sagne pasta here as I cab only find then and eat them when I visit m friends in Leece and Noti makes them fresh everyday. With the ragout sauce, the sagne tasted fabulous. We enjoyed all the dishes recommended by Toni and still had room for the fantastic tiramisu which was again delicious !. It has been a great experience of authentic Italian food, lovely wine, good service , good price and warm Italian hospitality by Toni ! There will certainly be more visits to come when we are back in town

Selected this restaurant for my husband birthday dinner after reading the many good reviews on Trip Advisor. We went on a Wednesday evening and the restaurant was already full when we arrived. Glad we made the reservation. We were greeted warmly by manager. The friendly owner Tony came by to talk to us about food and that its from his family traditional recipes. He really made us feel like we were in an italian home chatting happily about food ! We had the risotto balls and calamari to start.Then we shared the lobster linguine and the gnocchi with pesto sauce.It was good recommendation by Tony as we enjoyed every dish and we didn't overeat so that we could have the dessert platter which includes a sample of different desserts made with recipe of Tony's sister. The dessert was divine and it came along with a birthday song for my husband by the staff. Our favourite was the tiramisu. Despite a crowded restaurant, the service was very personal , attentive and friendly. The ambiance was cosy and relaxed. Will certainly come back again

Great ambience, fantastic service, thirst-quenching beverages and most importantly, delicious food! Chef Toni made sure we got the best experience at Noti restaurant. We have visited Noti on multiple occasions and the food and service as been tip top! I can't choose my favourite dish -- they're all full-flavoured and unique in their own ways. But if I had to choose... The mushroom risotto with white truffle oil would probably win. The tagliere platter was incredible, my eyes become bigger than my stomach when it arrives at the table. Once we munched our way through the starters and mains; then came the dangerous part. Dessert. Toni's homemade Tiramisu really hit the spot and brought our amazing experiences at Noti to a fantastic end! Definitely recommended and worth re-visiting :

I was me and others friends who decided to book a table in this restaurant to spend the Christmas Eve, we search several options in Singapore, but either restaurants were all booked or price was too expensive (300 USD), so, we decided to book a table here. The welcome from the owner was nice however the warm welcome was all we got; the food as OK, nothing new, my feeling is that they were more worried on cashing dollars that night than offering a good service. Wine was expensive and bad, the staff sat at another table and started to have its dinner, obviously we were left alone in our table without being asked if everything was OK. Did I mention we had a reservation but we had to wait like 30 minutes to have a table? Very impersonal restaurants, for some minutes I felt I was eating at a fast food restaurant, where nobody ask you if you're OK, if you like the food. Wouldn't recomend this restaurant at all
4
Nice food and service is very good and like the food provided here by Chef Toni. Drink are also very good until now
5
I have been living 10 years in Singapore and I tried many Italian restaurants and I have to say Noti with the chef Toni is the best.
4
Great food, friendly service staff, and Chef Toni's always around to give food and wine recommendations. I've been here 3 times in the evening. Chef Toni's friendly and welcoming to everyone who walks into his restaurant, and his food - amazing! Highly recommended!
4
Just had a lunch with my clients there. Apparently the feedback on the trip advisor was quite right. The food was really nice especially the main I.e. Lobster pasta. Will definitely come back again.
5
Our hotel recommended us this restaurant and to go there on a Friday night and we were certainly glad we did ! The street is fulled with restaurants and bars built in charming traditional houses and it closes to traffic on weekends. When we arrived at 9pm the entire street was packed with people. eating, drinking. The vibe was really nice. Our hotel reserved a table for us in the restaurant. Despite being packed, we were shown very quickly to our seats. toni the owner came by to greet us and explained to us about the dishes and the traditions of them. My husband had the pesto gnoochi and I had the mushroom rissotto while our boys went straight for the sagne pasta with ragout. We were very happy with our dishes. they were hearty and the flavour was authentic and delicious. For dessert Toni recommended his sister's Tiramisu which was totally divinine ! Food is great, Service is attentive and the ambience is lovely. We will certainly come back agai

We enjoyed our experience at Noti. The meal was quite good...had calamari and the lobster pasta for our main. I would like to return to this place for another try and another selection...both of these were good but not particularly noteworthy. The ambiance was nice...and service warmed up once the owner paid attention to it. Overall a positive experience
2
Went in because it's a great looking place and had a good ambience but the cheese and meat platter (shared starter) had some sort of processed meat that looked like spam and our aubergine main course was utterly tasteless. Service was good but five beers, the shared starter and two tasteless mains are not worth $160.00 (no dessert or coffee or mineral water). Disgraceful

We were a group of 10 and called earlier to book a table. It was good thing we did as the restaurant was packed, full house on a Thursday night.Our table was a long table, with 5 seats on each side. The setting was nice though it meant harder to share the dishes. Service was warm n friendly from the lead crew, Rizal, and Toni was also busy serving and welcoming the guests. The crowd started streaming in about 8pm. That's when the service level went downhill. The restaurant could do better with another extra pair of hands. As it is, the crew had to take orders, clear tables, serve food, refill water, present the bill and look cool n remain friendly while doing all that. Tough call.Food was a bit disappointing for a top 10 restaurant in St. We ordered the crab linguine, the sauce looked mashy. The sagne pasta was like lasagne, it was recommended but did not hit it off with us. The gnocchi w tiger prawn had a nice pesto sauce, though the tiger prawns were elusive. The beef tagliata was flavorful, however, it was a ribeye cut, and so had a layer of tendon which can't be eaten.The braised lamb shank was the clear winner for the night. It was served on a bed of finely mashed potatoes. The portion was generous and good for two. We also ordered two platter of starters, which was well presented. The risotto balls were served in individual dainty dish. For desserts, we had the choc cheesecake which got the thumbs up. The tiramisu, choc lava cake and triple gelato did not quite make it.Don't expect a romantic quiet place. It was quite noisy. Tables were arranged quite close together to maximize seatings. Tables had a simple decoration of a vase of a single stalk of red rose, which had wilted. Maybe a more hardy flower would be more suitable in the hot weather here in Sg. The bill was reasonable which worked out to ~$60+ per pax. Including 2 bottles of red wine. Would we be back? Maybe! Our kids missed the mushroom soup which is only available for lunch.

We have been twice to this fine little restaurant and can recommend it highly for a casual night out. Great atmosphere and good warm lighting. You have a choice of sitting outside where there are a few tables. Inside we recommend the room on the right when looking at the restaurant from the outside, as more atmosphere. Toni - jovial chef and patron is there to take care of patrons and prepare good food. We can recommend this restaurant
5
We have eaten at Noti three times and each time we love it!We have eaten here for our anniversary in the cozy restaurant at a table for two. We have also eaten here with a large family group and with children. The staff is very friendly and attentive. They are very accommodating for vegetarians as dwell, adjusting some dishes to meet dietary restrictions. Or children always find something yummy, but we all love the risotto balls the most. Order several as they'll go fast.Parking can be a challenge. There is a small car park just up the street from the restaurant, but for the most part we have parked at the closest garage and made the short walk. Enjoy

I've been here in Singapore since 10th December I tried all the Italian restaurant but I'm saying the best one this is... Thanks NOTI ... Very
5
I went with this restaurant on last week. The staff is great of services with full Italian information, the food is very nice if drink with Italian wine (Chianti) = )
everything was great !
thanks, we will come back again.

Toni and his staff couldn't have been better. The service was fantastic as was the food.
The restaurant was set up for a great new years eve with all the trimmings.
We are going back before we leave Singapore.

Hadn't been to this Noti place before, hence blind date - with choice based on online reviews only!Reception and hospitality by staff and Toni himself were jovial and warmhearted, restaurant style and atmosphere also very welcoming.Special 5-course New Year's Eve dinner was well presented and very tasty, the freeflow champagne and red wine chosen also of good quality. Staff was extremely attentive in keeping air out of glasses and serving each course as and when requested.Nothing ventured, nothing gained. With the wife over from Germany for a short visit, this blind date made for a great evening after all. Will certainly return to check out the regular menu.Dear Noti-team: Keep up the good work
5
We were a party of 7 ranging from grand-parents to small people. We booked Noti's after reading the great reviews here on Trip Advisor and we were delighted with our choice. Toni, the owner, is great fun, he made great recommendations for the food and the wine and we had a fabulous evening.The food was superb, everyone loved their dishes and plates were scraped clean. The staff were efficient and very friendly, the restaurant has a very cosy atmosphere and we will definitely return.Highly recommended by this family
5
Was very happy that we selected Noti to celebrate our New Year's Eve. The restaurant was decorated beautifully for the festivities with great ambience for this evening. We were offered with glasses of champagne to start our evening. Occasionally the owner tony came to share a toast with us. Only the set menu was available with dishes from Tony's hometown in Italy . The dishes were special and delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly ! Despite a full house, the service was attentive and fast as the dinner came with free flow champagne ! Will certainly return again to try out the regular menu

Hi there people.. Firstly I want to thank you Noti for such amazing dinner we had on 23rd December 2013. It was our first time there and my few words here would not be enough appraisal for this place.OWNERS:Husband and wife, Toni & Winnie. Wonderful people and great staff they have. LOCATION:They are set in a wonderful shophouse at Club street. Clear and broad Noti signage could be seen from far. They occupy 2 big shophouse units. INTERIOR:Amazing setting. They have designed the place with heart and soul. You can choose either to be seated at the 'white' side or 'dark' side. White side is more casual and chic while Dark side is moody and romantic. Which did i prefer? well both, because we sat on both side and eventually decided to join the dark side. Both unit is set in informal dining chairs and timber table, with great artwork and good lighting ambience. It can be informal and formal depending on how you dress and want to be set in. FOOD:(we did not mean to order way too many, but through the course, we couldn't help it but to order more! you see other tables were ordering these delicious looking dishes and trust me you will be tempted too) - bruschetta : huge platter and bread was amazing. Toni baked everything himself. now which restaurant would be so dedicated to bake bread daily and also their own virgin oil. the bread was just so soft and thick and healthy and ingredients were fresh! cheese? will just melt in your mouth. and risotto balls too.. amazing taste. its beautifully fried, it was not oily and its perfect. - mushroom soup : again delicious. creamy thick fresh and healthy tasting soup. its one of the best mushroom soup ever. and its big so good to share. - Mains : mushroom risotto : big portions. great texture to the rice. just perfectly done. and mushroom were great, really tasty risotto and also with a dash of small salad on side. - Mains: beef tagliata : now this is also another great mains. my partner and i were just digging into the dishes and sharing all the food and we just could not talk much! we were just too busy eating and enjoying so much. beef was nice texture juicy and nice fragrant to the whole dish.- dessert: tiramisu & passticcioto : to finish all our delicious dishes was quite impossible as it was too much food for two of us. but what do we do when the rest of the tables too ordering such wonderful dessert and looking so good and trust me they were making such happy moaning sounds? and they look so happy eating their dessert. Toni was wonderful he brought us 2 desserts and they were mind blowing. firstly i am a girl who is not much of a dessert eater however THIS was ridiculous if i do not eat. they were just yummy. again toni made everything himself. they are his family tradition recipe.. and i would like to know too! its just special taste to the ice cream with small nuts and tiramisu was one of a kind and passticcioto was never before taste. and they were all the way delicious. As i said before no words can be enough to describe these dishes. so with these above, and also not to forget the great service, attentive staff and such hospitality from the owners, I dont see why not that people should go try out! well i know i am definitely going back there. and we will with each of our own loved ones and friends. You wont regret. its amazing wonderful place. highly recommend

Booked a honeymoon visit as it was so highly recommended on tripadvisor. Shown to a table in between two big tables even though we had asked for a table a little bit more romantic. At first the staff were attentive but lost interest as soon as our order was placed. My starter was cold and would of returned it if a member of staff was to be seen. Mains were good, especially the pasta. Finished the night pouring my own prosecco. A night that had been planned a long time ago and we were very much looking forward to was very very disappointing
5
We were invited by our friends to Noti for our Christmas dinner. It was truely an Italian experience from the people to the food ! Toni the Italian owner came personally to wish us Merry Christmas and explained to us the festive dishes which were traiditonal dishes from his region. As recommended by Toni, we had the cheese ravoli, lamb shank and this handmade pasta trofi which we have not seen before ! The dishes were all delicious. For dessert toni recommended us the traditional Christmas cake Panetone and a cream custard tart made with his sister's recipe. The desserts were fabulous ! As it was Christmas, Toni even came to sit with us for a round of christmas toast. It has been a great christmas experince for us at Noti from the service to the food. We felt like we were in the home of an Italian family !!! We will certainly come back agai
5
I was at Noti with friends and we really enjoyed all the food and desserts such as their yummy selection of cold cuts, fabulous braised lamb shank , gnocchi with pesto sauce , tiramisu and passticcio or cream custard tart... And of course lots of champagne through the nite ... Thank you for such a great nite! We will be back again for the great hospitality :
2
On christmas eve I made a reservation. Anyway I had to wait about 10 minutes. Another 20 to be ask for drinks. In the middle of the dinner all the staff join in a table to eat and we stay unattended. The wines are totally overpriced!The meal meet expectations but the service isn't bad, because it does not exist :
2
I went to Noti for the second time this year and I was extremely disappointed (first time was ok but not great). While the outdoor seating is delightful, the food was just average (desserts were particularly disappointing) and the service was appalling. We ordered a bottle of water that never arrived and I ordered a pasta dish with anchovies that arrived without anchovies.....Needless to say the dish was very bland without its main ingredient. I informed the chef when he was outside next (10 minutes later) but I had already eaten half my dish so couldn't be bothered sending it back. The staff was clearly overwhelmed (and under trained) despite having only half the tables occupied. After waiting for the bill for at least 15 minutes, I finally decided to get up to settle the bill at the bar to end this not so nice dining experience. Good thing that my company was good
4
Came during happy hour... Got a mixed entree plate which was good value for money... The drink specials were far from special but it's singapore so all the drinks are expensive. We also took the waiters reccomendations and ordered two of the pasta dishes for mains. Both were perfectly balanced authentic italian. The service was a bit pushy trying to get us to order more and come back another time in our trip but this is club street so they have some stiff competition. Also the owner toni hollered at some beautiful women in front of everyone which was a bit in bad taste. But it's all about the food which was right on!But

We went to this restaurant for our wedding anniversary after reading the great reviews online.Upon reaching the place was pretty packed on the streets with lots of noises and alcoholic smell everywhere. However Noti restaurant was totally different when we entered, it had a cosy feeling with beautiful furnishing, Toni got us a seat and his staff served us. We ordered the risotto balls as starters and it tasted okay but not as good as claimed, for the main course we got the pasta and mushroom risotto, which were great but not worth the price. The best dish was the dessert tiramisu and in house red wine, which was one of the best we had tasted.We would've appreciated our meals better if the staffs did not come over and ask if the meal was okay on every dish served, it kind of defeat the purpose of a private meal and we were eating halfway, which is a kind of a hassle trying to answer. Toni seemed to stick to the western culture of trying to mingle with the tables, which in my opinion is understandable but I'd prefer a quiet table, good food and just a smile will do
5
My partner and I visited Noti on 14 December 2013 after having read the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. Noti was found in a small vibrant area off New Bridge Road. We received a warm welcome, was shown to a table quickly and our drinks and food order taken in a timely fashion. The food was very good quality and the prices ranged from SG$19-50 per main meal. We shared the Risotto Rice Balls as a starter followed by Mushroom Risotto Rice for my partner and I had 'sagne' a spin on lasagne and together with a couple of Carlsberg's and two glasses of Prosecco our bill totalled SG$130. To summarise a good atmosphere, good quality food and well worth a visit
4
It seemed that Italian food has become quite popular in Singapore, since last I visited, so I sought out Noti as a well-reviewed option. We were not disappointed. The italian owner wandered around the tables during our early evening visit, recommending dishes and ensuring his customers were happy. I really enjoyed my crispy duck salad with pomegranate, walnuts and citrus dressing, and my partner raved about his prosciutto-wrapped, pan-fried mozzarella. My pasta main was also delicious, but my partner was less impressed with his scallop main course. At $150 for two entrees, two mains and two glasses of wine this really did give us a little taste of Italy, in Singapore
4
Visited on a Thursday evening. When we arrived - around 7 PM - the place was almost empty, but in an hour many other customers arrived. So, in the beginning we received very personal and efficient service.Toni, the owner, is a very determined person, he had a very strong opinion what suits us best. I do not complain, the food was tasty, but perhaps I would appreciate a bit more personal freedom when choosing the courses... The amount of food were reasonable, leaving room also for the dessert. With coffee, I could also enjoy a glass of sambuca, which was a pleasant surprise.The surroundings are nice, and dishes so stylish we would be happy to own such at home
2
We came to Noti for a second time tonight and most of the dishes were good. We had mushroom risotto, homemade pasta, roasted chicken. Those dishes were all pretty good. We also ordered the scallops (which were forgotten on the order) and they were terrible! The other issues we had were that it took over 1/2 an hour for our first drink order and our food order wasn't taken until we were sitting for over an hour. I'm not sure if they were under staffed but Tony acted as if we were crazy for pointing out the obvious complaints. There are lots of places on Club Street that I'd rather spend my money on our next visit.
5
I've now been to Noti around 10 times in the last year for lunches and dinners and felt the need to review it again as it has certainlypolished off the few rough edges it had after opening and thoroughly merits it's high ranking in Singapore's list. The food is excellent, the service is much improved and attentive and the price remains reasonable (where other favorite Italians in Singapore have started to abuse). Brava Toni
5
This has become my all-time favorite restaurant in Singapore, and we eat here almost every weekend. The menu is relatively small, but every item on it is incredible. Toni is a great host, and chef! Make sure to ask what the special is I often change my dinner choice after hearing what it is. The risotto balls are the can't miss starter and the chocolate torte or cheese platter is the perfect way to end the meal. I have recommended this restaurant to every friend who has asked about a new place to try and they have all loved Noti as much as I do!On Friday and Saturday nights after 7 the road in front of the restaurant is closed to traffic and you can sit outside. Great tables to people watch
5
The owner Toni couldn't be more hospitable. I've tried a pasta not to be called name now. Just one word: Superb. Chocolate cake for dessert also tastes beautifully. Love Italian cuisine. Love this restaurant.
5
Fantastic true Italian restaurant. The owner/headchef Toni has really tailored a great menu. A place i will go to again and again.
5
Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere and excellent service.
Highly recommended
- Stumbled into the area by chance - loads of great restaurants and bars.
- Definitely the area for Europeans to go at the weekend.
5
On our first trip to Singapore, My husband and I chose Noti after reading all the many positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We were glad that we had visited this restaurant. In a few words, this place has it all: fantastic service, delicious food, great location, cozy and tasteful decor, lovely owners who come and personally take care of every customer, and very affordable.The menu is very well constructed and very reasonably priced along with a great wine list. The service was very attentive and friendly - well done guy'
5
I speak with the owner tony on the phone and he tells me to ask for him when I get there. My wife and I meet him out the front and he gives us a very warm welcome . Service was very good all night. The music was very upbeat and on the louder side for a restaurant but suited my wife and I perfectly . Risotto balls and calamari starters were very good. My wife enjoyed a pasta dish I can't recall the name of and I had the half seafood platter which was a lot of food but good. When I go again I won't order the seafood. I think the traditional Italian foods on the menu would be much better . A great night overall
5
Lively venue (without being too noisy), lovely atmosphere, attentive service, faboulous host and great food. What more can you ask for!? Had a really nice evening there yesterday, and already booked our next night. As an extra bonus, the restaurant is located in a highly recommended street, fun and lively. Recommended
5
I chose this restaurant based on previous Tripadvisor reviews/ratings and we were defnitely not disappointed. Toni and his team provide a really great dining experience - warm and friendly with a fantastic atmosphere. The food was delicious - the arancini are a must have! Our only regret was that we didn't leave sufficient room to try the desserts. But....this gives us a good excuse to return. Which we will surely do
5
New Yorker taht read the reveiw on trip advisor and decided to try this outsanding restaurant.Owner and staff made your feel as if we were regulars and the food as well as the wine recommnedation was top notch. Should definitely be a stop to all when visiting Singapore
5
I am Italian and I have eaten in Noti at least 10 times and this should tell you a lot already!!Sagne al ragu' from the Mama's recipes menu is THE MUST have there but there's a lot more in the menu that is really good.Toni the owner and manager who is also the host, makes the whole experience unique and fun!! Make the time to chat with him and get to know him
5
Went on a friday night with my Singapore colleagues. The entire street was vibrant with a lively atmosphere full of people sitting al fresco along the street. Despite the restaurant being full, the staff was attentive and we were quickly brought to our table. The restaurant has a great ambiance. Toni the owner came to introduce the food to us. We went for the traditional dishes made with his family's recipe. We had the sagne pasta which is totally original and the gnocchi was amazing. We also gave in to Toni's proposal of desserts which was fabulous especially the tiramisu and chocolate tart. A fantastic experience of great service and delicious Italian cuisine. Will certainly come back again to enjoy
5
We had a great dinner at the restaurant. Starter,main and dessert were fantastic. The restaurant got a boutique ambience, clean and comfortabe. We might come back in our next business trip!
5
Warm, inviting with a chic yet cosy hip atmosphere. Food was great - make sure you try the risotto balls as a starter. Make sure you book for an evening meal - gets full quick.
5
Very nice cosy place, the host Toni is very friendly. Making everyone of us feeling at home. The food served is fabulous! Desserts is also a must try!
5
Friendly host, awesome food! Chillax Ambience! Need I say more?? The desserts are just sinfully tasty! I can't help but to have them all!
5
Due to the unexpected extension of my Singapore trip, I have a chance to visit this restaurant. Honest speaking, me and my friends were glad that we had visited this restaurant as they has a friendly host, Toni and serve an amazing food. From what I can tell, Toni is an awesome person, he treats every customer like a friend and he really takes care of everyone in the restaurant. Other than the host, of cause the foods are great, especially the deep fried Risotto balls, Lambs and home made expresso tiramisu!! We absolutely had a good time here and I definitely will go back again!
5
As a frequent visitor of Singapore, my usual choice of food will only target at southeast Asia food. But due to typhoon Usagi approaching Hong Kong, which extend my stay for 2 more days,therefore I have time to try something new! Our booking was 8:30, but we arrived a bit earlier at 8:10, a very friendly server come and say the place is always ready for us, who is the host of the restaurant Toni! Toni is a very funny and highly attentive to every single table who has any request. The recommendation he gave us was brilliant in both taste and portion. The dessert plater was also awesome, especially the tiramisu! Atmosphere of the place is really suitable for a group of friend to chill out and gather! I can't wait to come Noti again!
5
Our trip in Singapore got unexpectedly extended due to typhoon in Hong Kong which our flight got cancelled. On our extended nights, we were glad that we found this restaurant from trip advisor after viewing the great reviews and having a few days of Asian food in Singapore. We were amazed with the food quality and we all love the ambience. Toni who impressed us all with his warmth welcome. You can feel this since the reservation stage by phone with him. Customers in his restaurant are all just like his friends who he needs to take care of, he has been going around the restaurant to make sure everything are smooth and fine and ensure satisfaction. We also feel like friends visiting his home. He made great suggestion to us regarding what to try and ordering portion is perfect. Try the deep fried Risotto balls and dessert here is a MUST try ‚Äì homemade chocolate tart with Vanilla Ice cream & Annalisa‚Äôs home made expresso tiramisu. We had an enjoyable night with our Singapore friends and will sure be coming back again
5
I went with a friend largely because I read some excellent reviews on Trip Advisor --- and will certainly return. Shared the appetizer of cheese balls (can't remember the actual menu description but they were delicious); followed the owner/chef's recommendation to get the gnochi pesto entrees (both of us did) --- I was in heaven! Dessert -- once again we took the chef's suggestion and had the absolutely outrageous chocolate pie with a crust so hard that they provide you with a steak knife --- just fabulous!My only concern was that toward the end of eating our entree the restaurant was "invaded" by a large group of folks from a nearby (?) office --- they were intolerably loud (and the low ceiling didn't help) so we moved to an outdoor table for dessert and all was well again. It was an annoying intrusion but one that the management couldn't really help to solve -- and our relocation was fine. Hardly enough of a problem to diminish our overall enjoyment

We walk on Club Street and we accidentally find Noti restaurant . This is an delicious Italian restaurant . We are so interested in two dishes : risotto balls . It makes you feel it worth what we pay for. Because it s an Italian restaurant so its tiramisu is the dish we cant skip it . It s so sweet and greasy . Ambience is so quite when we came there and we enjoy it . Amazing vitsi

Great place to go with friends, as a couple or on your own, the staff are Attentive, Welcoming and Fun. The food is delicious. The restaurant itself is rustic adding to the ambiance creating a fantastic atmosphere. So glad our friends took us there, it's one of those places you want to go back to so well worth a visit

Being our first trip to Singapore, we chose Noti after reading all the many positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We are glad we made this choice. The restaurant is trendy though located in Chinatown area. My husband had the stuff aubergine and I had the gnocchi with pesto as recommended by Toni the owner. The dishes were authentic and delicious. .As this was our honeymoon trip, Toni even offered us champagne to toast to our wedding while his staff gave us many useful information on good places to go in Singapore. I left Noti with very good experience. Will certainly recommend it
5
My partner and I have been to Noti a couple of times now and have been meaning to write a review for it. I had been craving for a good plate of crab meat spaghetti for years, until we discovered Noti's who have been so generous with the crab meat in their pasta sauce. Another one of our favorites will be the fried risotto balls which you won't find elsewhere. We are definitely looking forward to our next visit, and a special thanks to the charismatic host Toni for making each visit so homely

Just went there yesterday night. The restaurant seemed to be doing well, it looked almost full with diners. We were starving when we arrived at around 9.15pm. After waiting for around 20 mins, no one came to ask our order, my friend had to go find the waiter. After 5-10 mins more, still no one, we couldn't wait any more and decided to leave and walked to Cugini Trattoria Pizzeria instead. Perhaps the restaurant was a bit understaffed
5
I tried this restaurant when it first opened (few months after).Generally restaurants offer good service/food at begging and later it gets average. Surprisngly things @ Noti have changed, but for better. Why? 45 dollars for a delicious and abundant seafood platter? Gnocchi with pesto (as the pesto should be)?If you never been in Italy is unlikely you tried the pesto like this (the way it should be). Wine selection: one word, actually 2: Tignanello, Antinori. I could continue, but then i might come across biased. I brought a friend new to Singapore 2 weeks ago, and in his (& her wife) words: "we woke up the day after and we were still talking about the food". Honestly, good effort to the manager, owner and staff to keep up the work

My boyfriend and I dined here and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. For the entree we shared the risotto balls which were absolutely fantastic. For the main course we both had the creamy pasta with pancetta. The flavour was fantastic but the pasta was way too al dente which ruined it for us unfortunately. For dessert we both had gelato which was very nice. I had the house wine and he had a beer and the bill came to $118 which was quite a lot for what we got. Had the pasta been cooked a bit more I would have given the whole dinner 10/10. I have to say the service was absolutely fantastic and it had such a great atmosphere that we will definitely be back.
5
I have had one of the best and worst italian food in singapore and all i can say that this place reminds me of home. The family atmosphere and the food! OMG!!! the beef simply melts in your mouth AND the seafood platter was soo fresh it blew my mind. I have been NOTI'fied im going to be a regular now. my mum, fiance and sister loves your little hidden gem too
4
We had a great dinner at Noti last night. Our appetizers (Risotto balls and Parma Ham Salad) were fantastic, as was the tirimisu we had for desert. Service was great - in particular Rizal, who helped us decided on a lovely bottle of Shiraz. Ambience was nice, low-key and intimate. What's keeping me from giving Noti a 5 is our salty mains -- we'll definitely go back to Noti, but next time we'll request to go easy on the salt. I definitely recommend this place
5
Wonderfull place to spend an evening. You ll need to book a table in advance - very popular (or be the first to come =)). Do try spaghetti carbonara - very interesting recipe. Look for the chef - he has great wine from his province. So can recommend this place for 100%
5
Cracking our head with menu, there's one staff came by and asked our preferences, excellent recommendation. The house pour white wine is nice too and only cost $8 at happy hour.The main course took almost 45mins but it was worth the wait ( ordered tiger prawn gnaucchi or smth), lastly we ordered mascarpone cheese cake it was the best cheese cake that i had ever tried and will definitely visit again if i come to sgp. Though its abit pricey for us as a malaysian, range around ($8 to $38). Price for 2 person with appetiser, main course, dessert and 2 white wine is around $7

We came to Noti because it rated no 4 on tripadvisor and because my daughter just loves all things pasta. A lovely smart casual restaurant with a more casual bar next door located in a very pretty European looking part of Singapore. I made the reservation online from Sydney and also advised that my husband is lactose intolerant. From the moment we arrived, the service was friendly, prompt and excellent by all staff. Even Toni, the owner, came out and met us and chatted with us like old friends. His mother was at the restaurant, from Italy, for 3 months showing him and his chefs how to make pasta from scratch. Let me tell you, it was not disappointing. My daughter said it was the best pasta she's eaten in her life. She had hers with a basic tomato sauce whereas hubby and I had ours with fresh lobster and crab. It was fresh, light, tasty & very flavoursome Even the bread was made from scratch. The dessert, tiramisu was superb. In actual fact, some of the homemade desserts are recipes handed down to Toni by his sister from Italy. By Singapore standards, the price was reasonable. You get what you pay for and it was certainly worth every cent. We only had 5 nights in Singapore, but we had to go back a second time and take our friends whom we met up with. They couldn't believe how good the food was. The second time we went, Toni came out and greeted us like long lost friends. He was great in remembering hubby was lactose intolerant and once again didn't disappoint. Would we go back....DEFINITELY!

An understated italian restaurant on club street with a great atmosphere, authentic Italian host and great food. I recommend the red snapper. I highly recommend any other foodies looking for something new to hit up this spot. A real hidden gem!
4
Had a wonderful evening with attentive service n good food. Reasonable price. Will be going again soon.
5
Great food & service. Was crowded when we entered but we enjoyed our night without having to worry about long waiting time for the food!

We decided to try this restaurant based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. The restaurant is located in a quiet and nice area with a few other bars / restaurant. The restaurant itself is quite high-class, although a bit dark. The tables for two are quite small, but the overall atmosphere is quite cosy. The menu has some very typical italian dishes and the choice is quite wide. The chef runs around (but mostly to the people who appear to have most money) telling about his specials, with a very friendly italian accent. We thought he was a bit overdoing it...The food was good and quite typical, although nothing to dream about for nights...Service was friendly but became quite inefficient as the evening was progressing, to the extent that it took us almost 30 minutes to get the bill and pay.But overall a good experience, if you have a bit of money and some patience
3
Dined here on a Saturday night with friends, and the evening started off wonderfully. We were warmly greeted and seated in the restaurant which had a really cosy ambience, if not a little chilly from the air-conditioning just like everywhere in Singapore.Tony the chef / owner was a friendly chap, making diners feel at ease and sharing little personal snippets which made the dining experience more special. For example, he mentioned he uses olive oil which comes straight from his family‚Äôs farm in southern Italy. His recommendation for wine was spot on, and it was easy to see his enthusiasm for good food was genuine. The arancini was a delicious starter ‚Äì highly recommended. But unfortunately, that‚Äôs where the nice experience ends. Service was painfully slow, it seemed like they were very short staffed on what was a very busy night. Basic elements of good service were missing: water was not topped up unless requested, plates were not cleared for a very long time, and food took a long time to be served, and when it arrived, it was luke warm. We were far too hungry by this point (1.5 hours after being seated!), so didn‚Äôt complain. We couldn‚Äôt catch hold of a waiter anyway! Again, we had to ask for plates to be cleared and then ask again for the dessert menu. The food was tasty but not exceptional. It was nearing 3 hours since we arrived, and lucky we had a good bottle of wine to keep us satisfied. No one arrived to take the dessert order, so we decided to ask for the bill (having to get up from our seat and find a waiter). After repeated reminders, it took a further 15 minutes for the bill to arrive. Would we go again? I‚Äôm not so sure. It was nice and I‚Äôm willing to give it another chance, but there are more options out there, so wouldn‚Äôt rush back. Tony was a nice guy, and we appreciate his friendly chatter, but he should perhaps be spending more time in the kitchen
4
Great restaurant. We enjoyed the authentic Italian. We were both very happy with the entree‚Äôs and our pesto gnocchi‚Äôs with truffle and desserts. Nice ambience and well located in Club Street (enjoy a pre-dinner drink close by). The only slight slip up, which they rectified, was at their suggestion they were going to surprise my wife (birthday) with a candle on her dessert but they forgot. I mentioned this to Tony and that he could make it up to us with some complementary limoncello‚Äôs. He was only too happy to oblige. Recommended
5
We went there twice in the same month. The food was excellent and the service impeccable. On our second visit we were early welcomed by Toni and offered free champagne while we waited for a table. We loved the personal touch in the service and would definitely want to go there again.
4
The owner is very friendly and certainly went out of his way to try and ensure we had a great time, perhaps a bit to over the top at times though when you just want to eat you meal and chat amongst your dining partners. The food was very good but not exceptional, the homemade pasta was not the best I have had. But overall a good choice
3
This restaurant is in a great location Club Street is a great spot. The hospitality of the restaurant was fantastic, Tony the owner out does himself with making you feel very welcome. I thought the food was ok, good family style food however Mamas pasta dish was very good. Would I go back, not sure, if I was to go back it would have to be because I was made feel very much at home. The wine that was suggested to us was ordinary a little rough but drank it then had to unfortunately order another bottle which was deliciou
4
Let's face it, everything that needs to be said about this place has already been said, but I just felt compelled to rate Noti, especially since we had such a contrasting (bad) experience at the eateries in Clarke Quay. Tony is such a passionate, expressive and welcoming host. He greets all the customers and you feel welcome the moment you set foot in the place. Some of the dishes are traditional Italian, but many have Italian roots but modern twists. The snapper was incredibly fresh and flavoursome. The rest of the family shared some pasta dishes, and the gnocchi was a knock-out. The pesto sauce was the best I've had in a long time.So, dining is about the experience, sevice, ambiance as much as it is about the food, and Noti delivers on all fronts
5
Great vibe in this Resturant. Toni the owner makes sure to speak to all diners. Food was authentic Italian and beautiful. Like it was cooked by Mamma!! Great place to eat.
4
This is one of the restaurant that I am sure that I will be visiting once in a while!
Great food! GREAT people.
It makes you feel very comfortable!
2 THUMBS UP!
5
This restaurant is a gem - excellent food, fair prices, authentic owner, a breath of fresh air in overpriced Singapore. No better sagne pasta in town! Thank you Tony.
5
Had a wonderful meal & service from Tony & his team. Beautiful snapper and a lovely new Zealand savugian blanc . Coming back!
5
Visited from a friends recommendation on a Tuesday night. Was treated to tip top service and fine Italian "mama" dishes. Deff a must try, going back for my second trip tonight.
3
Visited Noti during our recent holiday in Singapore. Looked it up due to the recommendations but honestly a little disappointed based on the ratings and reviews. We had several items on the menu, including the homemade pasta and while good it was not over the top. The service was nice/friendly and for the most part efficient. A bit over rated but we did enjoy the experience.
5
I was there with my dear husband yesterday, for the 2nd time, and we were wowed again. We felt so welcome. This time we had Lobster with sagne pasta. (not in menu, created because we love the sagne pasta and sauce, but don't take beef). it was so mouth watering delicious. The flavour of the lobster against the texture of the pasta was just mama mia amazing. Toni.. you must put this in your menu. For appetiser, the Risotto Cheese Ball in Arrabiata sauce were just as good as the first time we had them in Feb 2013. For dessert, Annalisesa's tiramisu.. just as wonderful.Toni, being the gracious host, offered us champagne, and limoncello on the house. We had a delightful time. Grazie tanto Toni and team. Looking forward to new creations after your trip back to Puglia, Italy. We will be back. :

Noti restaurant on Club street is a real gem. Tony (owner and chef) not only does a great job recreating and improving on old world recipes, but he has created an atmosphere that makes you feel more like a friend than a guest. His creations are made from scratch and he blends the favors, textures, and presentation into something extraordinary. This is a "must visit" anytime you are in Singapore
5
Having found Noti online we weren't quite sure what to expect. However, from the very warm welcome to the food and outstanding service, our experience was so enjoyable we went back for a second visit in the same week. Bit naughty on a school night, but the hospitality from Toni and the the team was worth a revisit. We had a throughly delightful time. Great hosts and the food was exceptional. Can't wait to go back. Thank you from Gary and Jo to all at Noti you made it very special
5
My wife and I was having our one year Weeding Anniversary dinner at Noti Restaurant - our first time there but certainly not the last.Toni and his team managed to give us a great experience and we had a fantastic evening from our first glass of prosecco to the double espresso at the end.Key words around Noti for us was the unique and original Italian experience (and I have spend a lot of time in Italy)Already at the starters it was clear that focus was based on fantastic ingredients - good oils, herbs, cheese's, vegetables and meats.As our main course's we choose a few Italian classics; gnocci with pesto and tiger praws and homemade pasta with parsley, garlic, chili and oil - all of it of course topped with fresh flakes of parmasan cheese.If anyone thinks this sounds too basic or maybe even boiring your should definitively stop by Noti and check this out - the taste of both dishes was nothing but amazing. The balance and flavours of the tastes where nothing less than amazing - you don't need more than that.Of course we had to finish of with TIramissu and like the main course it was simple, original and VERY tasty.Noti really gives you a local Italian experience from you walk in the door and it's a lot of value for money.Thanks to Toni's mother for spending 4 month outside Italy in Singapore to train the kitchen to do these classic Italian courses to perfection.We will be back very soon.. :-

The spring chicken salad is my number 1 for lunch and rissotto for dinner with the starter platter. Mmmm.
5
The Noti Restaurant and Bar is situated in a fabulous quarter of Singapore. Well worth the visit and great place to spend a lazy evening sipping cocktails, eating and just having a great bar. Well done Noti. Yon Ivanovic will frequent this establishment often
5
We visited Noti for a friend's birthday dinner, and absolutely loved the place. We didn't even have to order from the menu - Toni pretty much took over after we told him our budget and the fact that there were two vegetarians on the table.We got bruschetta, risotto balls, fried calamari, and cold cuts for starters; an outstanding mushroom risotto, a generous pork dish, pasta with ragout, and a fish preparation for the main course; and ice cream, apple pie and tiramisu for dessert. Toni suggested we share the dishes (2 plates of each) between the 8 of us - this worked very well, because we got to sample lots of variety. Being Indian, I sometimes find European cuisine a little bland, but the food here was full of flavour. The risotto and the apple pie, in particular, were very nicely done. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a sucker for tiramisu any day, and this one did not disappoint.A delicious and uniquely personalized experience. Definitely recommended
5
I went back to Noti with a group of friends and needless to say Noti went above and beyond my expectations. Toni has always been a real good host and yesterday was just another example of his hospitality. Starting right from Prosecco to Desserts and the array of starters and mains were all extraordinary! I would strongly recommend Noti to folks looking for an Authentic Italian meal
2
We went to this restaurant on our recent trip to Singapore, after reading good reviews. The food was excellent as was the wine. The restaurant recently hired a new manager and he completely ruined our lovely dinner. He hovered over our table quite a bit and didn't give us any privacy. When some of his friends came in we noticed they were given free drinks and appetizers. He was constantly pacing the restaurant and making himself known. When we ordered tab water, the waiter brought us a bottled water and charged us for it; however when they refilled our water they didn't even pour us the water we paid for. Go for the food but be prepared to be hovered over
5
This is our 3rd visit - food, service and atmosphere wise it never fails to impress our family. Excellent, tasty authentic Italian fare. My favorite is the mama pasta and risotto is just wonderful. Even our 2 year old loves it. Not to mention, service team is tip top and the boss, Toni very warm and hospitable. Will come again soon
5
Great food. Simple. No fusion or what not people know to do in restaurants. Chef is Italian so i guess that helps. :) He comes with his usual Italian flair of being talkative, gesturing with his hands, etc. however he is also "Italian" when it comes to food. Really, in Asia the best Italian food i had. Not cheap but also really not that expensive and definitely worth it. Great atmosphere. You are being entertained and all staff is really friendly. From chef to the servers, the entire experience was superb
5
We were three guys on a business-trip who wanted something else than hotel food. looking for something special we came acros Noti. Situated in a authentic Singapore environment, we found this refreshingly different. Waiter "Sky" and Toni - the owner - makes you feel very welcome, while they entertain you.The food? - Brilliant - and in particular the "sagne" (twisted homemade fresh pasta) - is worth trying. I might shoot myself in the foot (as I'm going there again next week), but prices are VERY fair ;-)"arrivederla
5
This is my favorite place in Singapore for a authentic Italian meal that is not over pretentious and it is so affordable. The owner, Toni makes you feel so welcome. His team of staff is so genuine. I have nothing bad to fault about this place to date. I can see why there are so many regulars around all the time. This place is simply amazing. Good job, Toni
5
It was my first time to visit the place last week and man, I've had a great time! Toni (the owner) made us feel at home and came to check from time to time making sure we are enjoying the food and the place. It seems to me that that is not the first time I've visited the place because Noti has a homy feel. The staff also deserves a round of applause, or a clink of the glass perhaps?Keep it up guys
5
Love the food, love the service, we dine at Noti at least once a week and are regulars for their happy hour so what more can I say!
5
Great job guys. The moment I walked in i felt I had been coming to Noti for years. Great food always tasty. Good portions. Friendly service. Im coming back for sure. See you soon.
5
My Husband and I (Adrian and Claudia) have dinner yesterday night at this excellent restaurant the food and service were outstanding LOVE IT, and we met Toni excellent person, and his team also GREAT NIGHT, GREAT FOOD, GREAT PLEACE

So the million dollar question is, do they deserve the top 20 rank here?We were a party of 9 and celebrating 4 birthdays in the group. Started with the bread and it was good and fresh. The antipasti platter arrived and it was the usual hams, and the parma was good. Then we had the mushroom soup which i thought was ok but 1 of my friends proclaimed his home cooked one is better. There was a long 30 min wait before the mains arrived despite the place being half empty. We arranged for a sharing menu but what came were 8 individual plates of mains, which was odd. Shouldn't they be larger platters toshare? And there were 9 of us, shouldn't there be a 9th of something something? Just saying. Anyway, for the mains, the seafood pasta was undercooked and fishy tasting, the pork was average, and the fish also had that fishy taste. The chicken was the only good main and i think they used cumin. Dessert was a sharing platter of ice cream, apple pie, chocolate pie and tiramisu. The pies were average and dry, and the ice cream was dreadful and probably not made in house. Lastly, we had the birthday cake and it was 1 heck of a dry mess. I much rather they just stick candles into the pie slices and be done with itThe bill came and yes, admittedly there were 6 credit cards whipped out. But basic math would suffice but they didn't have that. There was a litany of errors with the credit card charges, and 20mins later, it was $155 each. We also found out we were charged $75 for the dreadful birthday cake . And the kicker? They said they "bought" it from the Hyatt hotel. Huh? A full fledged restaurant can't bake a cake? And anyway as i said above, they should have spared the troubleSo would i return and be prepared to pay $155 for a meal? Only if someone else paid for it. Noti m

Noti on Club street is in a great location. We visited on a Saturday evening to celebrate a special occasion. My wife reserved a table. Unfortunately when we arrived we found that we had been allocated the table en route to the rest room (not quite conducive to the occasion). Our request to move was dealt with very promptly and the staff were very helpful. The menu is very nice with light starters that can be shared or something more substantial to have if one wished. We started with the calamari and bruschetta. The former was excellent. The latter was heavy on the bread. For main course we had two pastas and a salad. The pastas were rather disappointing - one too salty the other heavy with overlooked pasta. Overall, not too bad but honestly better food can be had in many other Italian eateries around town
5
I first visited Noti's when I moved to Club Street in January 2013. From my first visit to my most recent (2 days ago) I was/am treated like a Guest of honour! Toni (owner/proprietor) is an incredible host and now a good friend. For as long as I remain in Singapore I will visit Noti's to see Toni and his fantastic team and of course to enjoy his great menu and an excellent glass of wine from Toni's home in Italy.The food is some of the best Italian cuisine I have ever eaten. The Risotto, Calamari, Linguine and Scallops are all 'Fan Favourites' but, I have eaten almost everything on the Menu and have never been disappointed. I highly recommend you visit Noti. A good night out and great meal is guaranteed.Jon N (UK

Went here with a friend for a official business meeting but it soon changed into a casual chat due to the friendly nature of the staff and now friend Toni, the owner of the restaurant.I was recommend the Mama Special Pasta Called "Sagne" and boy wasn't it fabulous. It has a very authentic Italians and old world charm about it. Don't get into details, just order the Sagne. It's a one of a kind.Last but not the least, the tiramisu is to die for :
5
Noti's is definitely a place to visit when visiting or living in Singapore. Non-pretentious, down to earth staff who'll make your visit incredibly unforgettable. Try their cold cut platter, calamari & risotto. Owner & chef is an authentic Italian with (i believe) a heart or gold. Unregrettable. One of the best bar & restaurants i've ever been to
5
I go to Noti on a regular basis and not once have I been disappointed. The food is amazing, you can tell an Italian Nonna, must have had a say in the menu. The ragout is to die for. The wine list is great with a good selection of Italian wines. The reason I continue to return over and over again to Noti is the exceptional service. They have the cream of the crop of Singapore wait and bar staff working. You are always greeted and welcomed like you are coming home which I love
4
Toni is an excellent host and genuinely cares about whether his customers enjoy their food. This was our first visit and my husband had the pork which was truly delicious. I had a pasta dish, which tasted fabulous but the pasta was a little too aldente for my liking. When Toni noticed I had left some of it and asked why, he immediately offered to cook me another dish and then out came the most delicious desserts, free of charge - a wonderful tiramisu and a chocolate brownie. We had a super time and will definitely be back
5
The restaurant it's really worth to try, the pasta is spectacular home made every day. I had some special pasta called "sagne" from Puglia. The familiar athmosphere and the good wine gives a special touch to this Italian Bistro. Absolutly an experience to repeat.
3
The restaurant has a great vibe. There‚Äôs a great wine and drinks selection. The food is delicious and very homely ‚Äì the pasta is outstanding, especially the ragu. But the service is wanting if the owner is not looking after you.
5
My husband and I came across this restaurant by chance. We were so happy that we did. The service was so friendly. Skye, our waiter, was so accommodating. Toni the owner was busy in the kitchen one moment, then chuckling with each customer the next. Every customer in the restaurant seemingly felt special and valued. We could not rate the service more highly and their suggestions on menu selection were spot on. Every dish we tried was fantastic. We had entrees and pasta mostly. Great value for money. The restaurant interior design was crisp and clean in style, presenting a very smooth image. On the whole it was by far the favourite meal of our stay in Singapore. We will definitely be back, and next time we will be bringing our friends! We recommend you try this restaurant. Simply can't see where you can go wrong
5
I celebrated my birthday with 20 of my closest friends and NOTI was the best place to have this event. Service and food was much loved by everyone. Toni and team are super special , I am myself in the hospitality inustry and give them 5stars all the wa
5
I was there on a Saturday night with my girlfriends. The place has the best Italian food ever!! They have a good selection on Wine to match the food. The ambiance of the place was as good as their music. The menu had some home-cooked styles of Pastas which were extraordinary. For the price we paid, I can vouch that this was the best Italian meal I have had so far!!I would happily recommend this place to anyone who is a fan of good Italian food

This is a very difficult review to write. I went here last night on the strength of the reviews I have seen here and I have a problem now. On the one hand, it really is not a bad restaurant, HOWEVER, it is clear there has been some hyping going on here. I enjoyed the food, wine and the time spent here, but on the other hand there were issues that really should not be here in one of the top restaurants in Singapore. I have to say I really hate to see so MANY single review contributors hyping a place. This is the reason I score this place lower. It probably deserves a four star score, but gets three because of the hype. Some of the dishes are great. I loved the risotto balls and the home made pasta dishes were great. The other dishes are a bit patchy though. The specialities in general are great. However, some other staple items, such as scallops, are a bit less than ordinary and overpriced The decor is ok for an Italian bistro, but again, is a little basic and not deserving of such a high ranking. In conclusion, I would come back here again. I would have the speciality dishes only and I would make sure Toni was around. On the other hand, this is simply not deserving of the very high rank on Tripadvisor it currently enjoys. Tripadvisor, please be more careful about your ranking system
5
Excellent! Amazing ! Pls come and visit Tony in his restaurant at club street... And try sagne al pomodoro ! Really an experience !! The taste and the colours of south Italy, red and sweet tomatoes, green basilic and the homeade pasta al dente! fantastic!!... moreover Tony the owner an awesome person who will entertain your stay in this amazing restaurant !! Come and try the taste of Italy

We went to noti on the back if many wonderful reviews on trip advisor. Boy what a mistake! Food is really third rate. We tried 6 dishes. All were average at best. There is much, MUCH better Italian in Singapore. Prices weren't high for Singapore. Total bill for 3 $250 with one bottle of wine however felt it was a waste. I dont write many bad reviews but this is one that have no problem writing. The one saving grace was that the service was excellent. But......owner walks around in a chefs outfit but he's never in kitchen........Avoid. Other positive reviews are wrong. All of my party agreed. We could tell from the first bite of our much hyped risotto balls. Tasted like they came out if a packet
5
I've been in Singapore for one month only up to now.Even before looking for an apartment, being Italian, I needed a proper restaurant to really feel home.That's what I found at Noti.Real Italian dishes, real Italian service. Toni and all his collaborators make of the Noti the perfect place where spend your nights enjoying pasta, fresh fish, pizza and high quality wines.If you wish to taste some good food, come to Noti... most probably I'll be there, eating his "sagne" or his "aubergines". Ciao
5
This was my 1st time in Noti Restaurant and being myself Italian, I was pleasantly surprised to find fine Salento's cuisine in Singapore. Apart from the good food, the staff were friendly, prompt but absolutely not invasive of our privacy.Summarising, it was a great experience and I will surely pay them a visit next time I will be in Singapore
4
This place is great, conveniently situated on Club Street with a really good menu and very friendly and helpful staff. We'll definitely be going back!
4
Great looking restaurant with great mamas Italian food. Restaurant owner is a great personality and adds to the experience.
4
Travelling abroad 365 days a year, italian restaurants are never an option for me, since they are never at a high level. Noti is clearly an exception since food and service are excellent. Good job Toni !
5
Noti is the best Italian food my wife and I have tasted in Singapore. It is half the price and twice as good as some of the "Celebrity Restaurants" in Singapore. The menu is perfectly sized, with something for everyone. The portion sizes are just right. The tastes and food quality are superb. The ambience is very chilled, and what makes it great is Toni. He personally serves the tables, takes an interest in your opinion of the food, and is extremely friendly
4
This was my second visit have failed to get in a few times since I first went due to its popularity. The food was fantastic yet again but the service continues to be a bit of a let down at times. Toni the owner is ever present, charming and obliging but he cannot be there all the time and the rest of the staff are either over stretched or need to up their game a little. We enjoyed our evening and will return for the food (and Toni)
4
My wife's culinary heart lies in Italy. Mine most definitely resides on another continent. But... Superb! Beautiful authentic homemade pasta. Hearty, tasty mamas recipe ragu (and that was my wife's dish!) I ordered the scallops and confess that I was intrigued as to how Toni planned to marry them with rosemary. Answer. Toni is a chef and I am not.We are in singapore for only a few days and can't believe we are forfeiting local cuisine and returning tomorrow night for Italian

Super find in buzzing Club St and Toni is a great host. Good food and wine sensibly priced, ask Toni for his recommendations, or just get him to order for you - what's good might not be on the menu. Or just pop in for a drink and see if he manages to persuade you to stay longer

I chose Noti to host 10 people for a wedding dinner last Friday night - am very glad that I did. Completely superb in all areas!The food and wine was excellent, with superb service and a great atmosphere. A lovely menu was put together by the restaurant manager Rizal who was very helpful with organising everything prior to the event. Toni the owner/chef was also wonderful, and a very friendly and charismatic Italian who will make you feel right at home.Beautiful risotto, calamari and spaghetti Great work from everybody at Noti, and I cant thank you guys enough for the superb time that we all had

After seen many good reviews we decided to try Noti yesterday. Toni (The owner) recommended our starters & mains and we were not disappointed. Calamari and the home made sagne pasta were my favorites .Noti team truly make you feel like home,which is rare in this part of the world. Everything we ordered was great. Service was professional and friendly. One of Singapore's best restaurant, if not the best.We'll be back for sure....!!! :

We decided to try Noti having read favourable reports but unfortunately we were left dissapointed. The starters were average despite ordering a selection of cut meats, which should be an easy starter to serve. As for main courses, the homemade pasta was fine, but one of our group ordered the chicken dish and this was more akin to KFC. (Poor quality chicken served with lukewarm potatoe wedges and ketchup...) It also took much too long to get our main courses - the people at the table next to us who arrived and ordered after us were served before us. When we requested more Parmesan cheese we had almost finished our food before it arrived. Wouldn't go back...

Delicious in a home-cooked, wonderful Italian way...but still kinda on the average side of things. Ambiance is great indoors and out. Chef is very nice and friendly! Must make reservations if eating during the evening hours! Good for any kind of a visit.
5
Noti is one of these rare places , where excellent food and service make up for a superb experience
One of the better places in the usually average Singapore food scene
4
Toni recommended our starters & mains and we enjoyed it...the dishes were very authentic...
Service could be improved & the restaurant was a little warm...
Thanks Toni....

If you are a pasta lover, Noti Restaurant is the perfect place for you. Number of Items in the menu just nice. Owner Toni was a very nice guy. Good service and nice ambiance for dining. Perfect place for couples to enjoy their meals.

The reviews of Noti on TA had been quite good so was expecting quite a fine dining experience but unfortunately I am only going to give it an Average. Food wasn't anything special and the vegetarian options weren't great. They mixed up my order, even though I had ordered a vegetarian pasta it had fish in it, and the second time round the pasta was really undercooked should have sent it back again but to be honest I was exhausted and super hungry - only arrived in Singapore from London a few hours beforehand. The service was really slow too even though the restaurant wasn't that busy
5
We booked Noti for our final dinner in Singapore and we were not disappointed.chef Toni Rosetti is a warm and gregarious host ,patiently explaining his dishes from his native Puglia in the south of ItalyWe had a starter and three main courses together with wine and desserts and spent s$200 for a family of 4.Not cheap but definitely value for money and worth the splurge for a special occasion!Will come again
5
Service is warm and friendly, and in line with the beautiful ambience. Been there twice now, and the ragout is definitely one not to miss! The cheese platter is also superb, as the cheeses are normalized out to suit most taste buds.Tiramisu is presented differently, t'was a pleasant surprise!I do hope Toni (and Noti) go the distance, and are able to stay on in Singapore.David and Jeanett
5
been to NOTI restaurant a few times over the last couple of weeks and have to say the food and service are just simply exceptionalmy favourites are the fried rissoto balls and the sagne pastaToni (owner) and team make you feel at home the moment you walk in..something rare in Singapore I be coming back 
5
I have a date with my daughter - its a girls out.We went to Noti and expect to have a good italian dining. We were greet with smile, and anxiety to serve. The staff even help us to find the food that are not contained pork. Their pasta are fresh, the meat are tasty. The ambience were perfect - everyone around us seems to be enjoy their time, their company, the food, the wine, the drink. Its easy to find a good time here
3
Had lunch here today with a group of people. I had a starter salad followed by Orecchiette with Broccoli and Cauliflower. The salad (rocket greens, cucumber, walnuts and parmesan) was nice, fresh and a good sized portion. The pasta course was under cooked, it had stuck to itself and was a little gummy in texture and the cauliflower was so overcooked it was unrecognizable.A waiter went to other tables to offer fresh ground pepper, no one at our table was offered pepper. Each of us ordered a pasta dish, none came with grated Parmesan nor was any offered. Dessert was offered to those who had ordered, it was deemed ok but not memorable by those who had dessert. None of us were asked if we wanted coffee or tea to complete the meal. All in all the food was ok but could have been improved with proper cooking technique and offering of pepper and cheese. Service needs to improve, wait staff weren't available so we weren't able to request pepper, cheese or more beverages. We had to flag someone down to get the bill when we were done and then again for them to collect payment
4
Just awesome, starting from food, drinks, staff behaviour, cleanliness etc. The food was amazing and delicious. Noti is a trademark of singapore, i must appreciate their handwork and effort to amuse the tourist and fellows for the best services they provide. Keep it up NOTI.
3
After reading the reviews about NOTI i decided to choose them for my friend's birthday dinner instead of another place i had in mind. But i have to agree with another reviewer BaddeHands that it kinda fall short of my expectations. The place is quite well furbished with black white and red as the main color scheme, but as the main color is black, the lighting could have been brighter. The tea light candle does not help. Me and my partner had a hard time reading the menu. The place is slightly warm as well.TONI is no doubt great as a host with his hospitality, taking time to interact with the diners and making an effort to explain the background of each dishes. He even brought out a special sweet wine at the end of our meal to share with us, very sweet indeed. His staffs needs to work harder tho. When i made the reservation, i gave instruction for a quiet/private corner but they did not seem to register that, as i have to request for it again when it was not even fully occupied. Towards the end of the course the flame from the tea light candle fizzles out, leaving us in even more darkness, and no one seems to notice it.Food wise, i find the dishes overall on the blend side, but do bear in mind that this is a family southern italian menu, with lots of olive oil and it's a more simplistic and healthy alternative to the fanciful ones we are used to. It is quite well done, just be prepared to be more adventurous. To be fair the food and drinks are reasonably priced, no complains.I give it a 3 star because i believe there are room for improvement, and to be the cream of the crop one really needs to have that extra "ingredient" to make it outstanding

Wear your high heeled wedges & swishy casual summer dress to this cool little hang out. Love the location on Cook St which feels like a little slice of old town Europe. Food was a solid delicious. Chef & owner has a great sense of humour. Servers have their own fashion forward Singspore look going on, very cool. The ambience is chic friendly cool bodega

First things first, the atmosphere of noti is fantastic even amongst the local ann siang neighbourhood of restaurants. Great lighting and decor not to mention passionate service. The staff were all exceptionally polite as was toni the chef. He is an incredibly friendly individual that makes you feel like a valued customer and friend as you dine. However, I will admit that the service staff are a bit under trained which I will attribute to the newness of the place. What they lack for in promptness and professionalism (i.e. learning when to inquire as to take an order, directing early comers to better seats not in the corner, making recommendations etc) they make up for in enthusiasm and politeness. Nevertheless, still alot of room to improve for Singapore's so called Top Tripadvisor Restaurant. However, I was not quite as impressed with the food as the majority of the customers here. My friend and I ordered a deep fried risotto ball which although excellently cooked I found was a bit too bland for my liking. She had an orecchiette pasta which was abit too salty according to her (and to his humility the chef as well) whereas I had a crab meat pasta which although good, was not something that I would label as amazing and memorable. The presentation of food here is relatively simplistic which adds to the charm of the place but Id be lying if i said a little bit more wouldnt be appreciated.So sorry if im abit unfair, but for being at the top of tripadvisor this restaurant only gets a 3 from me, if it were lower ranked I would rank it higher. In short, a great place but definitely not at the top 10 of singapores dining destinations
5
This is without doubt the best restaurant we have ever had the pleasure of dining in in Singapore. The decor is great, the food is outstanding and the lychee martini not to be missed. Tony the owner makes you feel at home straight away and have never met a better host. If you want fantastic food, ambience and a night to remember then do not miss out, my only tip is to book your table in advance as word is definitlely getting out that this is the "best restaurant in town"
5
we visited 'Noti' on a busy sat evening (9March) and were pleasantly surprised by the friendly ambience from the moment we stepped into the premisesthe service staff are exceptionally talented here ...smile and manners go a long way when running a restaurant anywhere in the worlddishes we loved and are a must...stuffed eggplant and fried risotto rice balls !we be back , in fact I asked Toni (owner) to book me in for my birthday celebration next month ..when I will host 20+ guestswishing Toni and Winnie only the best of luck ...you found a fan and supporter in m

The owner and staff make this restaurant. They are charming, welcoming and passionate about their food. However, they will have to try harder to succeed in a competitive place like Singapore where there are some excellent long established Italian restaurants. The dishes are well cooked and simply presented but the menu is similar to many of the menus found in Italian restaurants. The baked aubergine was excellent as was the calamari fritti but again, these can be found and just as good elsewhere. Noti is a gem and there are many pluses to make me recommend it. Home cooked Italian food is available in many other Italian chef owned restaurants in Singapore and Noti can and must pull ahead of them. Good luck Tony and staff
5
Where do I start - it was our last night in Singapore and ended up in Duxton Hill. After having a drink at a local bar we went wandering trying to find a restaurant which seamed busy and happening. After a good 40 minutes we decided let's try Noti as Tuesday night and full to overflowing so it must be good. The owner Tony greets us in true Italian style and found us a table. Somewhere in the conversation he discovered it was our 10th wedding anniversary trip and out comes a couple of complimentary glasses of champagne. The entrees Risotto balls and Bruschetta was simply as good as it gets. Followed by the most delicious home made pasta dish which wasn't actually swimming in liquid which was a great change and very authentic Italian. The service was fantastic without being in your face and overall an absolutely fantastic evening. As I travel every other month I always write a review on good restaurants / accommodation and have to say a huge thanks to "Tony" and your entire team for a great evening and definitely worthy of such a great rating.

I celebrated my birthday with my husband in this wonderful quaint restaurant. Toni made us feel at home immediately, what a charismatic and charming host. We followed his recommendation of risotto balls, and fried crispy squids.. just lovely. We wanted to try his mama's special Sagne Pasta, but as we don't take beef, he graciously offered to make it with seafood instead since he had fresh seafood that day.. really the most authentic tasty tomato based sauce, and the pasta was so unique.. a masterpiece... He promised to make it only pork based ragout for me the next time i'm there, but to let him know 2 days in advance. He came by our table a few times, sharing stories about his life in Puglia, Italy, his lovely wife Winnie, his work in Hyatt, his lovely olive orchard in Italy, as well as the secret to his mama's special dishes.. and to celebrate my birthday, he offered me a glass of lovely red wine from his own personal collections, as well as limoncello to go with his tiramisu (made from his sister Annalisa's secret recipe), you should try this.. heavenly.. ;) We had such a lovely Mama Mia time. Grazie tanto Toni & team
5
My wife and I have found our new favorite Italian in Singapore hands-down. Chef Toni is present in the dining room and our group loved seeing how much passion he brings to his establishment. He is a wonderful host. "Noti" offers unique dishes we have not found anywhere else in Singapore. The food is true home-cooked style Italian; we tried a few dishes and all were amazing without fail. Great wines, deserts, service, all for a very reasonable price. Great place to go with friends or for couples. Amazing place, don't miss it
5
Sea food pasta great. Cured meats and cheese tagliere, excellent. Wine selection, good. Staff friendly but with respect and attention. Place nice. Eat there again? You bet.
5
Call us crazy, but we ended up eating at Noti's twice during our week long trip to Singapore. Who doesnt love great Italian?You want great food, tremendous value, and quaint atmosphere don't think twice, go to Noti's.From the moment we walked in Toni and his staff made us feel like family. The warm welcome and inviting service was terrific. Toni gave us a tour of his familia history from Puglia, including sharing his secret weapons: "mamas recipes"The melanzane, or stuffed aubergine with minced meat and basil tomato sauce is a must starter. The bruchetta with mushrooms was very tasty. The meat salad had terrific parma ham and just the right amount of home pressed fresh olive oil.For entree we had a home made pasta with ragout and minced meat which had great texture and melted in your mouth. Rich but light. We also had a special beef dish that was very tender and tasty. The wine selection is good, but the house red wine was exceptional.For desert the tiramisu was his sisters recipe, and is to die for. We topped it off with lemoncello that was the perfect aperitif.No doubt this fairly new restaraunt will take its place as one of the best in Singapore. Grazie Toni!!!!

Me and my friends were at Noti Restaurant last week to celebrate my housband's birthday.Mr.Toni himself,the owner,welcommed us and made sure that we got everything that we wanted and needed.The atmosphere was friendly,we felt like we werw paying a visit to an old friend.Now let me tell you about the food:i must say that even if i had red good reviews about Noti,i had reservations about it.I just didn't belived that so far from Europe food can be so...italian!Exquisite!Mr.Toni proposed us a selection of dishies and every thing was delicious:the bruschettes,the salads,il parmigiano,the home made pastas,the fish,the crispy calamari,the veal...oh,and the wine-Pinot Grigio,hmmm!If you are in Singapore and miss the italian food,then there you should go.Thank you mr.Tony and your wife
5
From the moment we stepped in, we were treated like VIPs by the smiling and professional staff.Toni was amazing and Rizal was simply outstanding.This was my third visit to "Noti" and I was amazed how delicious the food was.Finally we had the opportunity to meet the guy who rocks the China town with his culinary skills, "Dino" the Master-Chef....small in size but works like a dynamite....To put it simply: it was an amazing experience.Thank you Toni, Rizal and Dino the most friendliest staff i ever met......

Liked the ambience of the place. As I am there more for dining, I enjoyed decor of the dining area. The owner had explained some of the significance of the paintings in the restaurant and I found them to give the restaurant great personal touch. The food was great! Especially the ones' under mum's specialties. I liked the Aubergine dish with meat on it and the fried risotto balls. As we went during Christmas season, we tried the pizza and I enjoyed it. The fish was also very well done. The service was good too.A nice place for a quiet sit down dinner with family or friends
5
Calamari and arancini arrive stright to your heart before reaching your stomach! The Wine...a s"dreem" in the soul! I just tried Negroamaro from Puglia: fantastic! Just now the Sagne are arrived... The parfum is calling me...ok you can either take a flight to Italy and sneek into an old Pugliese kitchen or just stay in Singapore go to Club Street and sit at Noti restaurant, that's all! And the trip begins...
2
We are well traveled tourists returning to Singapore each year a couple of times and we went to this restaurant because of the reviews here at Tripadvisor. Owner and staff are very kind, but food is absolutely nothing special. I think you go to a restaurant in the first place because of the food. I wonder how it got rated second best restaurant in Singapore . . 
2
After making reservations through the Singaporean website ReserveTable.sg it took nearly 2 weeks before someone from the restaurant was able to reply us with the Valentine's day menu.Staff were visibly over-stretched and whilst Toni was doing his best to see to every customer, we only had our orders taken after 20 minutes of trying to catch a member of staff's attention. The octopus carpaccio took another 30 minutes to arrive, and it was inexcusable that after waiting for nearly 2 hours, the second course of a seafood risotto was served and they had gotten my partner's choice wrong. I ended up finishing mine whilst waiting for a replacement which never came, because we eventually left as it was taking too long.Thanks for ruining our Valentine's meal - I'm sure it would've been good on a normal day, but we didn't expect this level of service when they had hyped it up with a special menu and all
5
We all know how hard it is to get good service at restaurants in Singapore....Well, look no further. At Noti bar and grill, staff members like Sky and Rizzo make sure you have a drink in front of you in no time. Very friendly and hospitable atmosphere! The food is also absolutely delicious!!! Try the porcini mushroom with truffle oil risotto, absolutely heavenly!!! I can honestly say it is the best risotto i've had anywhere in the world!!! The calamari and the mixed vegetable linguini were delicious too. I find that i don't bother trying too many other restaurants in singapore, as 50% of the time, the service or the food or both are disappointing. At Noti, i know satisfaction is guaranteed!!!! :
5
Without any doubt "Noti" is one of the best restaurants I've been to in Singapore.A wonderful place to hangout with friends.The foods were great and the service was excellent.I'm not an expert of Italian food but the "Calamari" and the "sagne pasta" was mind blowing.I would definitely go back when the next time I return to Singapore.Thank You "Noti" for a wonderful service.....
5
Singapore's filled with a mind boggling array of restaurants but Noti is really a rare gem for it's authentic italian food, ambience & hospitality.
Have been recommending whoever travels to Singapore. A definite must visit!
4
We got inside the restaurant at late but many people here. Tried some cocktails and local beer was smart and great taste. Great chance to make friend with other ones.
5
I have visited Noti this week and was positively surprised by true service. Food was authentic Italian and very tasty. Price are very very affordable for Singapore.
5
Nestled in the hustle and bustle of Club Street, you may find in Noti's a place for an intimate dinner for 2 or a wonderful night out for you and your group of friends. Dine in and be greeted by the quirky yet homely interior; giving the diners a feel of Italy. Or have the choice to sit outdoor and watch Club Street come to life. The entire dining experience went smoothly and absolutely pleasant, starting with very reasonably priced drinks which included house pours and crafted martinis (tip: flash your best smiles and maybe you'd get a glass on the house, the host is happy to see his diners as happy). The waiters were very helpful and had the bartenders to craft a non-alcoholic drink for my partner who wanted lychee martini without the martini - it was pretty good. We first had the Risotto Balls to share, starters portion are served noticeably to the number of guests at your table. Food choices were traditionally Italian from the salads, pasta to the risotto, a fusion of meat selection and under the sea choices. We both ordered the Halibut and Wagyu Beef Burger to share, fish was right to taste and the beef was cooked up to expectations. Portions were just right for each person and food was served in a promptly manner. Unfortunately we were too full to have desserts after. Oh, and a great place for Olive lovers - they were out of this world. First I've tasted such Olives, I believe they were home grown in Italy. Toni was an amazing host to his customers, attentive and always try to make you feel like you're just right at home. A great place for dinner and drinks; a place to unwind for the weekend especially with the romantic dinner settings to the bustle of Club Street in the late hours. Will definitely revisit for the authentic Italian experience
5
If you love tasty authentic Italian food, Noti is the place! Great and warm atmosphere too! Definitely a great place to hang out with friends. Toni and his staff make sure all his customers are well taken care of. I enjoyed the food very much and will definitely return whenever I come back to Singapore
5
Inspired by other trip advisor reviews I decided to try this new Italian ahead of my regular favourites and went with an old friend. The risotto ball starter I had was absolutely amazing in terms of both flavour and presentation and the beef main course was top notch too. The chef wanted us to try his calamari and offered them on the house to help finish our really good bottle of Pinot Grigio (Jerman). The service was reasonable although it took a while to get started.I will definately return
5
I loved every bit of this amazing restaurant on Club Street! One of the best restaurants I've been to in Singapore. Toni is an amazing host and will make you feel like a special guest in his own place. The food is truly delicious, service is fast and very attentive. Would highly recommend it to anyone loving Italian cuisine
5
I'm an italian expat, living in Asia since 2008 and believe me people, this is the best Italian restaurant I ever had in Asia.The food is very original and excellent!Difficult to eat like this even in Italy.The wine is also very good and the prices are really affordable.Service is a "first class service".I will definitely come back very soon
4
The staffs were extremely friendly, helpful and made great suggestions for both food and wine. The food is simply amazing and the price is very reasonable and the atmosphere of the restaurant is great too! I would go back there again for my next trip to Singapore
5
I am not a food critic, but I will tell you this: I am italian (and I hate eating Italian abroad because I constantly get disappointed). However when an Italian eats and keep eating in an Italian restaurant abroad, is because that restaurant is good. For real. First of all, something that not many restaurants have that is excellent, is a well trained Bar service. You can simply stop for an "Aperitivo Italiano" and you can have excellent Spritz and Negroni at almost half or 25% less than other similar bar and restaurants in Singapore (if they can do them). What is even more pleasant is that from time to time, (it happen to me the first time) I was offered a portion of excellent "bruschetta", with my spritz, at the house expenses. The food? I will not be long because a lot (good) can be said: How many restaurants here in Singapore make their own pasta? few to none. How many restaurants here in Singapore are capable of doing a Risotto with porcini mushrooms without overcooking rise or making it too dry (or tasteless). Few to none. The platter of cured meat and cheeses? Try the restaurant just before NOTI and you will have half of the portion at twice and half (2.5) the price. Mini burgers during happy hours at $8 Dollars? If you can find these, same quality, at a cheaper price in Singapore, I will pay them (in the same street are sold in a bar at 19$!!!). Overall it is one of the best (not only Italian), but overall restaurant in Singapore
5
So glad we selected NotI Tony the owner is the perfect host great selection of authentic Italian dishes so well presented and amazing flavors Well priced by Singapore standards good wine list great service if you want a true Italian experience font miss Noti
5
Toni the host is fabulous and welcomes you as if you are coming into his own home. The food was first class, we dined as a group of 5 and followed the guidance with a selection of starters to share. For main I has "Mama's special" and it was certainly worth it. A great evening
5
A perfect place for couples or friends looking to spend an evening out at a trendy venue with good food and drinks. Charismatic owner/host Toni, along with the cosy contemporary decor made my partner and I feel very much at home - just the right atmosphere to tuck into wholesome Italian food. My favourite dishes are the crab meat linguine and orecchiette, a type of pasta typical of Toni's hometown in the south of Italy. Highly recommended
3
Everything about the venue and night was great, except the food which really was very average. I don't want to go into each meal specifically, albeit to say that good quality ingredients are used, but put together they didn't really work and all 7 mains dishes we had were tasteless (entrees were actually ok). It's a shame really because it's a funky little spot but I won't be returning again.

Noti Restaurant & Bar 2 ReviewsItalianHours today: 12:00 - 0:00 OpenAdd TipAdd Bookmark54 & 56 Club Street, Singapore 069430Ann Siang HillCall 6222 0089DirectionsWebsite http://www.noti.asiaHours As an Italian living outside Italy I always struggle to enjoy Italian food in local restaurants. Well Noti Restaurant is an exception. Chef Toni offer Italian food as original as it gets. Fresh ingredients, true love and passion for good food and the famous Italian warm welcoming attitude. I definitely recommend the Risotto Balls (deep fried risotto balls with cheese), Deep Fried Squid, Risotto, Linguine with Crab, Wagyu Burger, Tagliata Beef, Staffed Aubergine and their Pizza. Everything washed down by a great wine selection and exceptional cocktails. I have to mention Noti's staff, always friendly and up for a good laugh while running between tables. Trust me, give it a go next time you looking for great food without have to spend half of your monthly wages in one meal! Great value for money
5
The owner/host/director...Toni Rossetti, is fascinating, fun and the perfect host. He stopped by our table a few times, even sitting down for awhile to chat. He told us the story behind some of his mother's recipes and about his career which took him around the world. His personality is matched by the excellent food, service and minimalist chic decor. We will definitely be back
5
In a few words, this place has it all: fantastic service, delicious food, great location, cosy and tasteful decor, lovely owners who come and personally take care of every customer, and very affordable. Toni, the owner and chef, offers simple but scrumptious dishes like mama taught him. Just perfect. A must try
5
Noti is by far and away my favourite restaurant in Singapore. The food is amazing - genuinely good Italian fayre with all the home comforts. The menu is very well constructed and very reasonably priced along with a great wine list.But what makes this place is the passion that Toni and his wife Winnie put into making you feel very welcome - as if you are coming into their home. This transfers to the service from the rest of the staff which makes every visit a plasure
5
Happened upon the place walking down club street , probably walked past some of the best restaurants in town ( what do i know, i'm a tourist ) ,this was the place that appealed to me most.we stopped for lunch and never looked back. The perfect parma ham salad, my Toni style burger with home made foccacia bread (" i baka da bred myself "), the stuffed eggplant,Mama's pasta dishes just like in Puglia, and i can tell cause i was there last August.the Pinot Grigio just right with it all. Wonderful deserts to round it all off.But the best part is the friendliness of the service and the unique kindness ofToni and his lovely wife Winnie. You walk away feeling you have made new friends.Noti's will surely be on my list of places to recommend in Singapore and should i ever come for another visit i will definitely go back myself. Thank you Toni for making my day :
5
Fall in love first with sincerity and heart warming service. Needless to say food was prepared with much love and passion. Spending just few minutes with Chef Toni, one can feel his passion and love to prepare and serve the best Italian cuisine. His food is real and delicious. The hospitality delivered by his team is simply fantastico!Having the best food and the best service in a cosy, elegant, romantic yet trendy place definitely will make me a return customer. A perfect place for everyone
