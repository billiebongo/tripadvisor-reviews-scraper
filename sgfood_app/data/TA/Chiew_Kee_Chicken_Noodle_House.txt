Very poor service. Came alone and they served groups who come much later. Try the other shop down the road, much better organized and same food

Food was really good. Chilli sauce and soup good class. Q was smooth though the ventilation in the shop needs improving but I guess that the authenticity of eating in a shop house. Will try another shop down the ally.

6 of us ordered one whole chicken with vegetables, dumpling soup and drinks and it cost less than $50.

The chicken here is average ... Not as tender and sweet as the other store nearby. Service is also not as good.
Still an ok place to eat.

I didn't planned to come here but when I am on my way to tian tian chicken rice, it caught my attention as it seems many locals are eating here. So after I finished my hainan chicken I came back here half full but still order a chicken noodles.This is a different type as hainan chicken, as hainan style is aimed for a soft texture chicken, soy sauce chicken is more about the taste of the sauce.But after eating the soft hainan chicken, it's hard not to compare, so I like the hainan chicken better but their sauce is actually not bad at all. It was still quite early when I go so no queue at all, even better !

I come here almost every 2 weeks ever since I move to Singapore a couple of years ago. The chicken texture is just so smooth, juicy and tasty. I can't have enough and every time I tried to order one chicken with 2-3 friends together. The shop itself is old and nothing fancy, do not expect the service and ambience in a restaurant. But, those are not important at all as the chicken is 9 out of 10 times damn good! I guarantee you will come back again and that happens to each and every single person I invited to this restaurant.

Shortly upon arriving, My family came here to eat. We sat upstairs and the service is adequate for this style of restaurant. The food came quickly, they got our order right between who wanted rice and who wanted noodles with their soy chicken. I felt the soy chicken was tender, moist and flavorful. I'm not sure if it's the chicken or cooking method but soy chicken in Vancouver is very meaty and kinda chewy which is why I don't order soy chicken at home very often. If it could be cooked like this back home, I would have it at least once a week. So I'm thinking it's the way our chickens are raised or the feed that they are fed. Anyways, I loved it so much, the day we were supposed to leave Singapore, we quickly came here for an early lunch to satisfy our tastebud

It you want to save money then eat this simple meal. It does the job as a meal. Not much choice really. If you love your food however then there's plenty of other great places to eat instead of here. Only negative was I wanted to order an additional dumpling soup but the waiter just says just share with your friends dish. Don't know why he didn't want to give me my own soup. Of course i was paying for the extra bowl, i wasnt expecting it free. Anyways weird.

What are the must eat items when you are in Singapore? Laksa? Chicken Rice? BBQ? Pandan cake? Bak kut teh? There are way too much of choices when you are in town, with my friends recommendation I checked out a noddle place near my hostel in China Town when I visited Singapore.Chiew Kee Noddle House was the one I visited, this place found in 1949 as a wonton noodle place in the beginning, and the founder learned from Hong Konger and modified its own version of Singaporean Style Soy Chicken, with a thicker sauce and stronger taste, the sauce is relatively more sweet. Having to go there just by myself, to make it simple just ordered a plate of soy chicken noodle. The chicken was smooth and I liked the thicken soy sauce that went so well with the noodle, the noodle didnâ€™t have alkaline flavor so it was good for me. The portion is pretty generous too. For drinks I have ordered a cold barley water, it was a little bit sweet which fit well for beverages in Singapore. Well, I love to explore new places, this 1st ever Singaporean soy chicken noodle place, is worth to visit, on top of trying those famous Singaporean dishes too

We passed by this place on our way back to Beary Hostel. As we were on queue, a Chinese man approached us and ushered us to a table. We didnt look at the menu and the man offered to serve us Chicken rice at $4.50. We were not disappointed -- chicken so tender and lightly seasoned with sesame oil and soy sauce, Will definitely go back when we get the chance.

Delicious as Singapore tradition chicken noodle taste.
Owner is very very to Traveller.
Price is acceptable.

If you want to eat something "local" with cheap price and wonderful meal, this is highly recommended. Probably is the best chicken noodle and chicken rice I had in Singapore.

One of the original eating houses, usually absent of any tourists, this gem is one to try on the Chinatown circuit. Best for lunch or early dinner - once the chickens are gone they close!

The noodle is nice without alkaline taste and not so overpower with the sauce. The chicken is also very soft, nice and tender. The breast meat is also very tender.

Were there last sunday for dinner. Ordered a plate of chicken and a bowl of dumpling for two. The sauce that came with the chicken was tasty, but not sure if any msg used. There were 6 dumplings per bowl. This is an old establishment and they have 3 shops along the same row. Paid total $12 for the bill. Average price and overall not too bad. It's a old coffee shop setting. Non aircon

We were walking past the shop and saw the chickens displayed in the window. Unlike the Hokkien style poached chicken they did the soya chicken poached in master stock.The place was crowded with locals but they found us a table for 2. I had the chicken rice and my wife had the noodle equivalent. Both were served with a bowl of broth. Total cost $8.The servings were larger than Tian Tian and to my taste more delicious. The chicken was tender, very tasty and covered with a sauce that had me eating every last grain of rice. My wife's noodle dish consisted of thin Cantonese wheat noodles, chicken and green vegetables. We both throughly enjoyed our meal and the broth was a perfect accompaniment with its rich complex flavours. It was a pity we discovered this on our last day as we would definitely visit here again.

Had lunch here 11th December, excellent selections on the menu....so many choices.My dining companion recommended the sliced chicken, I had mine with rice and she had hers with noodles.The dishes came with wonton soup and we had a cool drink each.Service was prompt, prices good value and the staff were friendly and efficient. It was lunch time with most tables turning over in around 15 to to 20 minutes...a great atmosphere...recommended

This restaurant has great chicken, prawn dumpling soup and their noodles are al dente good!Just remember to avoid lunch time as the crowd is crazy and the staff would require customers to share tables other customers. I remembered being stacked like tetris during our visit.Excellent food despite the crowd. Service wasn't as fast as we wished but was alright if you are with a group.Payment has to be made when the dishes are served. Something that is slightly different from others as we usually pay after our meals

Very bad service from a lady (stationed at the 2nd floor) this afternoon during lunch. No doubt on the food, just the service while she is taking orders. She got her own way of taking orders, that's fine with me so i was trying to follow her way of ordering. She shouted orders for Chicken noodle, and one of my colleague said he wants chicken breast noodle, and she stopped him and ask him to wait, one by one first, but nobody is requesting for chicken noodle, so she took my colleague's order, next she say Chicken rice, i want chicken breast rice, so i wait for her to say chicken breast rice, so a few of my colleague asked for chicken rice, one of my colleague asked for chicken's breast rice, she starts to frowl and take her order as well, i also want chicken breast rice, since she took my colleague's order (chicken breast rice) so i told her i want one plate as well, she started to argue with us, and i told her straight, just 2 chicken rice and 2 chicken breast rice and i think she is still confuse or what and she continue argue with us and raise her voice, so i just kept quiet and let her continue her argument. This is not the first time, the previous visit was not too bad. Today is worst. This kind of service is unacceptable, i know the business is good, i love the chicken rice too, but service play a big part as well. I will never ever patronize here again

The owner is very nice and kindness. Once we let her know that I am a tourist come from Thailand. She said "ah... Tailand na....." . We had ordered the noodle chicken with soup and lime juice. This is the perfect first meal in Singapore , very delicious. I like this restuarent and will come when visit Singapore again. At noon, more people in this restaurent . Please wait in the line
