Food was alright, service is ok but finds that the pricing is abit overpriced but luckily I got it at a sales price so find it worthwhile.

Good place for steak but limited menu. Many items sold out and limited non alcoholic drinks as well.
4
The food was not that bad ! The Indian service guy is very attentive and always very proactive. He even concerned about the safety of a little girl. This kind of action has never seen elsewhere .

a nice place to have a pint or two after work with friends. relaxing and nice snacks to go with the beer.

We came here today for lunch. Prices are a bit high. Has both interior and outside seating with a bar. Husband got a burger which was huge. Seems dense...not a normal beef Patty burger, however it was juicy. I ordered sliders as it stated beef expecting burgers and was sliced beef a couple pieces on each bun which I found absolutely ridiculous for the price paid. Service was a little on slow side and there were only 2 tables at the time. Nothing excited me...so not sure if I'd go back again

Initially I wasn't sure if I would want to bring my family there for a farewell dinner but was glad to have made the choice! Food was great and service was even better! Yuvi was superb and attentive to details. Was glad to have him to attend to us and will be back again

Had the promotional set lunch there on a weekday. The place was exceptionally quiet for a weekday lunch hour. Staff were very attentive. Had the chicken salad and seafood marinara. Preferred the former to the latter. Average tasting but no complaints for the lunch promotional price of $15 (included a drink at the end of the meal) 
3
Good food but over price for such serving portion. Steak well season and well cooked. Staff is very attentive and helpful to recommend for sharing dishes. Sad that we didn't have a good view of the fountain when you sit door. The music were very good

We had a few drinks with snacks after business hours on Friday in this bar-restaurant.Brilliant atmosphere, nice music and service was good but how is it possible that such a place can run out of Corona beer on a Friday evening!! I think the management skills needs to be reviewed!!
4
Service staff wasn't aware of some promotional discounts and seemed flustered initially. Food was good though. The cream linguine, strawberry salad and age-dried steak were all done nice and good. Bread with the ham platter was good too. Very small indoor seating, rather cramped actually. Set lunches seemed good value but I prefer the ala-carte. A bit expensive though
5
Awesome place, great music and reasonable prices. Staff and crew is always on point with their service and will do anything they can to make your day right.
Thank you Kamal, Jet, Constance, Edwin and May.

Great place, great people and great ambience! Thanks for the crew Kamal, Jet, May, UV, Edwin, and Constance for making this place so homely! :)

It was our first time here. Very pleasant experience. Lovely ambience and good service.Food was very nice. Highly recommend it to everyone.
5
One of my favourite hangouts after work. Real easy place to socialize with reasonable pricing, friendly and fun staff who prioritize customers with their requests. Thoroughly enjoyed times spent there.
5
Been to D10 for more than a few times and really love the ambience and staff! Always been a regular and will continue to be one! Special mention to the bar manager Kamal who took care of us despite the busy after-work crowd!

Dinner on a Friday night. It was crowded with crowd of people just chilling out . But in the restaurant itself, it was pretty quiet and nice. Had a steak and a pint of beer. All done nicely . Enjoyable dinner.
4
We had the bottle wine which is pretty good value and also the rib eye even though we actually wanted the wage beef that was out of stock on a friday evening.Rib eye was cook to our expectation just that it didn't really come with much side other than a little salad. It can be better
5
Been to district 10 many times always not disappointed with the service. It is a good hang out spot for a few drinks after work. Bought a bottle of Hendricks and kept it in D10, and when we went back the stuff of D10 even reminds us that we still have balance drinks left at the bar when we went back another time. Awesome crew

Dishonest thieving establishment. I paid $300 for a Macallan bottle and has a 40% balance during my last trip a month ago. When I went back last Friday, I was told there was no more balance and that I had finished it when my friend and I clearly remembered the balance during the last trip. Patronised D10 quite a few times and am very disappointed with their service. Beware if you buy bottles or anything from the establishment

We stopped at District 10 for a couple of cold, happy hour beers outside when we were down at Suntec City recently. The beers were SDG10, so reasonable enough for a pint in this area. A couple that were sitting at the table next to us had the wine by the glass and keft while we were there. They had left behind quite a bit of wine in the glass, perhaps half full. We witnessed two of the staff carefully pour the leftover wine from the glass back into a wine bottle, presumably for reuse, which is just disgusting. We can't think of any logical reason why they would do that otherwise. It should only be tipped out into the sink. So, dont drink the wine by the glass !!

Quite nice indoor ambience with friendly good service. The food is quite good too. The price is also reasonable.

Best dry aged meat - love the ribeye steak at medium rare! Superb wine and great service too! Staff are accomodating! Thanks.
5
Service was great, ambience cosy for friends' gathering and food was great! Will be back. Only lacking in coffee/ tea for drinks. :P
5
Normally more crowded than usual. And we.had to.wait.a little for the oyster to be shucked. But dinner was excellent. We had a little more than for 3. All crowded. So difficult to get service at times but the staff remains unflustered. And yes we needed more patience.
1
Sloopy, watery and No tasteComparing the price to the food everything was so bad, don't go here... 
5
It is just around the corner from where we are staying, been past it plenty of times and decided to try. Well did we have a lovely time, happy hour from 3pm to 8pm, and really good snack foods, wonderful Sliders, huge serve of very good fries. Lot of locals there plus tourists, very nice decor, we will be back tomorrow night, wish we had discovered it before.
3
Will definitely b good if the staff member had informed us earlier that the grilled chicken will take more than 20 min for preparation as people might b rushing for work

So I asked the waitress if any credit card discount particularly citibank because it was shown on the chope app before I make my payment. The lady said yes and came back with the bill without discount. So i asked why not and the manager have to step in and say they are still in terms to come up with other promotions and current promotion is not available. Would be better if you update your app and at least I can choose the other alternatives of discount like the pre-purchase voucher
5
Waitress who attended to us during our visit was highly attentive and knowledgeable about the dishes. Made our short dinner a surprisingly pleasant experience. Had the black angus beef burger that was perfectly medium rare done, highly flavorful and the thick cut made it a satisfying meal
4
Came here for late drinks on a Monday. This eatery offers $6 per drink for certain items on Mondays, which is awesome. This includes half-pint beers, wines, and liqueur shots. We sat outside, and it was wonderful to simply sit there and chat.I also recommend the truffle fries. A bit salty, but great
4
The food was great, ordered Scallop & Prawn Cream Cheese Truffle and 30 days dry aged steak.
However feels the price quite steep.
The service is good, and they served lots of different alcoholic beverages; so it's a great place for hanging out after office
4
Food was average, the ambience was nice, the server was attentive to our needs. The location is quite easy to find.
4
Great place to have gatherings. Steaks were cooked to perfection and definetely up to standard! Would come back for the grills again.
5
Food and service is on par with the value paid. Place a bit small but there were only 3 tables that night including ours. the rest of the customer were seated outside

Last evening, I made a reservation through CHOPE for my son's 20th birthday. My daughter recommended it as she had been to the UE outlet and raved about it, especially about the Parmesan wheel. So we went.I have to say that the restaurant does not offer value for the prices that they charge for their dishes. The grilled calamari at $26 was tasty, but could do with a few more pieces to match the price. My daughter's lobster ravioli is overpriced in my opinion. Give a few pieces more or charge less. I think it was $38 or $39! My son's fettuccini was simple and tasty, but again overpriced. Just a pasta dish with a few prawns and scallops. My wife's burger was good...again overpriced. The worse of all, was my lamb chops...3 skinny short pieces for $38! I have had better at many other restaurants and lamb happens to be my favourite meat.We eat out a lot and do not look for cheap food. We appreciate value and value will bring us back. I can't say this of my experience last night and I felt disappointed for my son. Thanks for the complimentary tiramisu anyway and that was nice.The service was good from the long-haired Filipina lady. I wished we could have had a much better experience with the food

Love the steak which is tender and nicely grilled on it's outside. The interior is exquisitely decorated. A staff in black was however in need of better training as she was displaying signs of frustrations and haste. Whatever it is, one ought to maintain professionalism. Staff in polo green shirt was however friendly and cheerful. I believe the one in black is of a better rank and yet ought to take a leaflet from the ones in green polo

Restaurant is small so make reservations, but great because it can't get crowded; being able to hold conversations without screaming. The bar outside is great for after meal drinks too. Not on the cheap side though. Food is good. Service is very good. A.c in the restaurant was a tad too cold. Staff quick to provide option of sitting outside (we declined) and hot water when requested. Would go again.

New this month: Bourbon flamed cheese. Nice tasty cheese with your alcohol. Nice cured meat wrapped around a thick slab of cheese that melts after being flambe with bourbon. All melty hot and yummy. Perfect comfort for the cold weather with alcoholic drinks. Only available this December they say. The chef recommended lobster pasta. Olio aglio style flamed with bandy. Mmmm. Lobster meat just came neatly off the shell. Mmmm. Wished there is clamp to crack open the shell properly. All succulent and sweet.

Dry aged beef is the highlight of this restaurant. I ordered the rib eye, 300g. However, they use thinner cuts and that means the ability to control the temperature and get that perfect medium rare isn't so easy. And it told. At my table, we ordered 3 different degrees of doneness: medium-rare, medium and medium-well. It came out one degree more than ordered. You could argue that it's the dry-aging that makes the cut have less blood, the meat inside wasn't as pink as it ought to be and the medium-well was hard. Have definitely had better dry aged steak elsewhere. And while this is not a high end steak restaurant, it certainly isn't cheap either. I would rather pay another $15-20 more and get a great dry aged ribeye at a place like Skirt or Bedrock.

The food here is amazing and the drinks selection good. Servers are friendly and attentive. If you are eating, do sit inside as it tends to be hot and smoky outside. It can get rather busy during Fridays and the weekends. So call to make a reservation on these days. During weekday evenings, the place is packed with mainly executives
3
Enjoyable dry aged florentine steak and sides! Wine selection was limited and my fort 2 choices from list were not available.
4
Very cool place at Suntec, great for after work drink and bite or food before shopping, cinema or Suntec concert. Good service (apart from a new starter who looked like a rabbit in the headlights), nice food and good wine selection. Nice atmosphere.
4
Food was delicious. The bread served was nice and soft. We ordered a steak and pasta with prawn & scallop. Both tasted fantastic. Service was also quite good. Would love to dine there again.
5
Food is good. Was pleased with this unique rendition of an Italian Sun-Dried Tomato Bread! The sun-dried tomato lends a burst of bright, intense flavour, and it's baked directly into 2 angles of the soft, chewy bread.
4
Good steak in the Suntec district, think District 10. The overall experience was within our expectations.
5
Excellent dinner. Quality of the meat was exceptional. Chef Luca was there himself and selected the best piece and then came to explain the dishes. Side orders were yummy too and Luca recommended us a lovely Italian Girlan Pinot Noir. Well worth it and birthday lady was happy too!
4
The small inside dining area was taken over for the night by a friend celebrating his 60th birthday party. He had around 36 people in attendance and it was just enough for the size of the room.The meal which was set was excellent both in choice and quality and the beef was out of this world.This restaurant is not trying to be pretentious and is the better for i
4
The food and services were excellent. Thought that it was outdoor at first sight, but the have an indoor dining area meant for those who are there just for dinner. The food is more towards the pricey side but no complains as it is very worth it. The service staff who served us was excellent as well, not sure if it was because there was me and my husband and no one else. Otherwise, had a great experience with them
3
I've been here twice once to have the florentine steak and once for burgers. Both are quite good, and not too over priced. The interior is a little dark, staff efficient, service is quite fast. The burgers are a little too finely minced for my liking but the taste is goo
5
The host was fantastic. Food was good and overall ambience of the place was ideal. Recommended place to gather with a group of friends for a dinner
