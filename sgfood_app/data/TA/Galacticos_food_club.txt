It's a halal joint, so our Muslim brethren won't have difficulties getting halal food, and alcoholic beverage are also not available there. The types of cuisine are varied; u can find Western, Chinese, Indian food, etc. As a football-themed place, the wait staff put on tshirts bearing footballing greats like Gerrard, Lampard, Maldini, etc. Not sure if they show live EPL games on weekends though
