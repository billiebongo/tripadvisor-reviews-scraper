Popular classic and alternative rock/blues bars inSingapore. One of the only ones I found during my stay there. Quick service, always packed so get there before 10pm because once the beats the fan, you're going to have to listen from outside.

Good music (rock, blues), occasional naughty jokes flashed on the screen, good beer and friendly staff. This place has all the ingredients of being my regular weekend joint.One little discomfort is outsourced food, so u gotta keep paying after each order. Ambience is good, along the Singapore river amid all the hustle of Clarke
