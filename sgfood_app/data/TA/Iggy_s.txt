Arrived late at night but restaurant staff were very obliging. Only ordered a few entrees and drinks but food arrived promptly and not too pricey for a hotel restaurant. We all liked our choices too.

We had a satisfying lunch on 3 Jun 2017 at Iggy's. Our group of friends were not only impressed with their commendable personal service, we were blown away by their innovative and dainty cuisine.Every course is well-prepared and tasty. Thank you for a wonderful experience.

I went with an expectation that the food would be expensive but not sure whether the food quality would commensurate with the price.We almost didn’t find the door to the restaurant as it was nestled at the side of a lobby foyer and there were no obvious sign to the restaurant except for a small “Iggy’s” word on a dark door.When entering the restaurants the place was quite unassuming but as you walk along the corridor to the main dining area there are private dining rooms.The main dining area is set with a full glass panel looking into the kitchen where the food’s prepared.We were not that lucky that day as the main Chef was not present. The sous Chef was there to prepare our meals...What can I say, from the service which was excellent to the food that was excellent too, I had a real nice time.Ambience was great and it was not noisy and the waiters is suits were very attentive but not intrusive.My friend and I picked the baked pigeon as the main dish dinner set.With the sous Chef which did a great job,... I wonder how better the food would be if the Chef was in.Really highly recommended

This was my 3rd/4th visit, and I'm always pleasantly surprised at how consistently good the offerings are.We had a curated menu of heirloom tomatoes with capers cucumber and basil, chlorophyll "acquerello" carnaroli, rock fish, Angus shortrib in celeriac vanilla puree, and mango sorbet with coconut, rice and lime.All paired with the very drinkable 2011 Bourgogne Hautes Cotes de Nuits and 2012 Marsannay Clos du Roy. These opened up very nicely as the meal progressed.There were many of us but service was still very good. It was attentive without being overbearing and professional.Highly recommended

Great place to indulge in good food and in exceptional company. Restaurant is discreetly well hidden on the 3rd floor. Service was immaculate! The portions seems very tiny but were particularly filling. The main course was the leg of lamb which was basted to tenderness and finger licking good. All dishes were very delicately presented and appetising. Kudos to the chefs and service team. Thanks for a memorable meal

Iggy's is something of a fixture in the Singapore fine dining scene, and after many years of intent, I finally sampled the offering. I didn't regret it - at all. There were two fixed menus, and I chose the "Gastronomic" option: nine separate courses between "Snacks" (more usually described as amuse bouche) and two separate desserts. Each was absolutely delicious, well thought-out, and beautifully served. The portion sizes were just right: large enough to taste properly, but sufficiently small as to allow consumption of all nine without feeling - er, stuffed. The combinations were unique - to me, at least, e.g. a dish of forest mushrooms with matsutake, abalone and a mangalica pork "veil". I hate to focus on one dish, when all were so good, but the Snacks that got the ball rolling were exceptional, and themed on well-known Singapore favourites, such as Roti John, the likes of which you will never have tasted elsewhere. The only discordant note was the "Singapore sling", which like the real-life cocktail version, was too sweet. The staff were excellent: attentive, but not intrusive. I'm sorry that I didn't have a table with a view of the kitchen, but that I suppose, is the fate of the lone diner.There was a reasonable selection of wines by the glass (Coravin style), albeit with a rather heavy emphasis on Burgundies.If you are dining on a tight budget, do NOT go to Iggy's. If you want an excellent and varied meal, representing good value for money - do so. You too are unlikely to regret it

Made the booking just a few days before and didn't have any problems. Went with family and it was 5 of us. They sat us right outside the kitchen and we can kinda see the chef's at work they the glass doors. The main dining room is very small but it definitely makes it feel exclusive. There are private rooms to use as well, but I didn't get to see it. Food was tasty and well presented. Service was warm and attentive. Definitely a nice place to bring to impress and at this price point for lunch, really good value! Hope u find this review helpful!

Had lunch with wife on a relaxing Saturday for lunch. Having let visited this place 10 years ago, the moment I sit down at this cozy dining place promised to be a gem and what followed demonstrated the hard work this place puts into in making the whole gastronomic experience a wonderful time to remember!Tried the 6 course degustation menu and I must say all the dishes are a real sight to behold, taste and above all, experience when you look back after your meal. My lunch took me around 90 minutes to savour, and honestly, high marks on all fronts for this Singaporean institution. Next time, will have dinner there when I next visit Singapore

My wife and I came to Iggy's for a birthday celebration and it was overall a pleasant experience.We liked the high quality of the produces and presentation, and the service that was professional. The decoration of the restaurant was modern but somehow we found a bit too contrast.We felt that it was maintaining the high standards that it was famous for over its many years in the Singapore culinary scene; however we would like to see it to continue to innovate and move ahead with the many new world class restaurants opening in Singapore, bringing in new ideas and standards. With no doubt the ingredients were exquisite and of top quality with the likes of top grade waygu beef, lobster, caviar, white asparagus, but so do other top restaurants offering the same. Being one of the leading "go-to" restaurants in the past years, we came with high expectation and were expecting more from Iggy's with that "wow" factor, which kind of fizzled out from the middle of the degustation menu.It was still a very nice fine dinning restaurant by all means and standards but Iggy's as an Singapore culinary institution, we wanted more

The important things about restaurants is its life span and the challenges it faces in ensuring they are relevant and competitive. I've followed Iggys for a long time now and the one thing I can say - its never been better. With a fairly new team on board in the kitchen, they have done brilliantly. I've visited thrice in the past couple of months and Chef Aitor Orive has been consistently good. He is innovative, enthusiastic and interesting. He is a thinker, he is someone who looks into the way flavours complement one another. He never tries to be gimmicky or trendy and I can safely say he has been the best chef Iggy has employed. It would be really hard for me to recommend any dishes, because each time I've been there, I've been served new dishes and new creations! However, a few dishes do remain firmly in my thoughts even as I write this, especially the vegetable dishes:1. Sansai (pork belly, uni broth, potato espuma)2. Chlorophyll carnoroli (winged beans, mustard green, bitter gourd)3. Vegetables with dashi broth and winter truffleIn fact, everything from the intelligently curated winelist to the 'pre dinner snacks' to the mains to the desserts are thoughtfully created and presented, with one main target in mind - to provide the consumer with the ultimate dining experience. I must admit I was not such a frequent visitor a few years back, but these days, for a complete fine dining experience, look no further. Iggys admittedly isn't the cheapest restaurant in Singapore, but this is an establishment that has survived for more than 20 years in a really challenging industry. They are reputable, they have won the top awards and they are not a new startup 'trying to be the new Iggys'. In my opinion, they are now really back at the very top. I dont want to speak for others, but I suspect if you ask the most ardent food and wine connoisseur where is the best restaurant in Singapore for a special date, for a special occasion, for a hosting of an event or to entertain an overseas guest, they will point you to this very restaurant I'm currently reviewing

Had a great meal here with friends, service was very good. Interesting menu concept and kudos to the Chef for delicious meal.
4
Creative and fanciful courses to amuse the palate. Perhaps a little too artistic and pricey at the expense of culinary excellence. Recommended for special occasions.
5
For what we are given the price is reasonable. The lobster rice dish was awesome. I also liked the vegetable dish. Frankly for foodies it is superb!
5
I went here for a 40th birthday dinner. The place is very expensive. There is a six and a eight course meal. I went for the six meal course. Each course is very small and each one tastes wonderful. And it is a famous restraunt also. I went here with my family
2
First visit to Iggy's Was immediately put off by the stark "conference room" interior, not very cosy and intimate nor buzzing with noise.On paper the menu looked interesting but the dishes were very hit and miss. Trying hard to create something new and exciting can sometimes take away from pairing flavours well. One of the first dishes of Uni in a cold slightly citrus jelly wasnt a hit, you couldn't really taste the Uni.Generally the savoury courses were under seasoned and sometimes to sweet and the dessert was the opposite. With so many fabulous fine dining options available in Singapore I was very disappointed with this restaurant
5
Went here for a birthday lunch and can honestly say it was delicious. The setting is very intimate with a see through window into the kitchen. The service was a little bit stiff but overall efficient and unobtrusive. The menu selection was varied - 4 courses with about 3 choices to select from per course. The amouse bouche of a tomato meringue with anchovies was a taste explosion and set the scene for what followed. It was all outstanding but the pastry chef deserves a special mention, sensational! The house champagne (Laurent Perrier) was delicious as was the wine-by-the-glass selection we tried. Had a look at the wine list which also seemed excellent.Overall well worth it depsite the priceta
4
Some of this was very good and other parts so so. In general food well executed and balanced but perhaps an over emphasis on foam in places. Bread was so so and lacked finesse if not slightly underdone. Owner charming and helpful. Service was very mixed, at this level you expect attentive and well explained dishes but staff had habit of leaning across and serving bread right to left across diner! Room is plain and not sure it quiet works, especially when kitchen closes shutter to clean up. So I can see why some reports are mixed. Overall a calm place in a busy town
5
Came here for a work dinner, paid for by work. We tried the 195 sgd set menu, attached. The food was uniformly excellent, and the service outstanding. The maitre'd was courteous and witty, while the chef himself came out to introduce the dishes and recommended wine. Great characters. Most memorable dish was the bomba rice with lobster and squid, deep crustacean flavour with enjoyable contrastive textures. The rest of the dishes were also delicious. Would I come again? Yes, but only if I'm not paying for it myself. Despite enjoying it immensely, I personally would not pay that much for the food... I'd rather go to a tapas bar or an izakaya to get my fix. Does that make a peasant? Probably. 195 sgd can get pay for at least 4 nights worth of meals at a tapas bar, and I'm sure that my level of enjoyment would be pretty close. Perhaps that's the point though - this place is for splurging. Props to the chef and restaurant staff, this is a place for special occasions when you want to impress.
5
Been there twice, it's expensive, but this is how I want to splurge!Last time I was there, they didn't have their signature dish on the menu, I hope they do next time. Nonetheless, every item was superb, and I left the place very happy, very full, and intoxicated by wine and romantic time with my wife.The signature dish is pasta/noodles with tiny whole shrimps, that don't need de-shelling. Surprisingly delicious.Service is so impressive. Hopefully I can go there next time I'm in Singapore for Chinese New Year, late January 2017.[I'm not sure if it was really in February 2016 that I visited Iggy's, sorry about that

We had the set lunch one saturday.The place is windowless,pictureless and the decor is not at all conducive to a convivial atmosphere.This is a real pity since all the food was simply stunning.Small courses bursting with flavour and presented in a very Japanese style.A strange wine list also focussed on Burgundies from one producer which I have not seen before.The food makes the visit worthwhile but I do wish the place itself was more fu
5
very creative food using great quality ingredients, every dish was well execute, the flavors were balanced and nice presented! the wines one of the best selection you can find in singapore!
5
Amazing and creative food, very good service, a must when in Singapore, better in the evening when its busy. The set menus are the best price value
3
had lunch -- not quite sure why this restaurant is consistently top-rated in the country -- wasn't particularly surprised by its food or invention.
4
Been here so many times. Always love the food. Simple using the finest ingredients from Japan. Keen in every details of the ingredients.
5
The Executive lunch is a special pleasure, from the bold and elegant fusion in the 'snacks' through the finesse of the Oyster and the burst of flavours in the Bomba Mellow Rice, each dish is artfully created. This prelude leaves the main course with a hard task. The Iberico Pork was good and then an extraordinary finale in the very unassumingly titled 'Brioche' which was so much more. To complete the picture, owner Ignatius Chan is a delight to meet - humble yet enormously talented

I've been coming to Iggy's since they were still in Regent Hotel. I recalled the first 2 times were amazing. I had what I would call as 'culinary orgasm' back then. However, over the years and until now, my experience with Iggy's has not been consistent. Sometimes good, sometimes average, but one thing is for sure, I've never felt the culinary orgasm again at Iggy's.This review was for a lunch visit I did last year. This time for a quick 4-course lunch, and this time the experience was a good one, but still not wow. Appetizer, pasta, and dessert were okay, maybe only beef is the one highlight of this lunch. I still gave them 4 stars instead of 3, as overall experience is still good on average.One thing about this current location at Hilton --- they don't have nice dinner counter as what they did in Regent. Their old location at Regent felt brighter, the counter experience is nice. Counter is good for 2 people mostly, but they had at least one corner where 3-4 people can sit. At Hilton, they also have counter, but they now use it more for food preparation. I am not sure why, but I love their old location more.Now that they are closed for renovation, I hope they will open to a better design and better feel of the place
5
The food at Iggy's, as you would expect, is purely exquisite. Every mouthful is an explosion of new taste sensations.The service is very attentive and the courses all served both beautifully presented and with perfect timing.The down sides...It is very expensive and although I think it was excellent value for money, some might be critical.The restaurant ambience is questionable. I almost felt that I was dining in a converted hotel conference room - it is on level 3 of the Hilton Hotel - and there were only 6 tables set up - so it gave an appearance of either super exclusivity or not many folks interested in dining there. With only 6 tables, and given the prices, I would have expected perhaps a little more privacy between tables, but we were still "just in a restaurant".Still, the quality of the food overcame the downsides and for a truly unique culinary experience, it is certainly worth a trip

i visited there recently to celebrate my granddaughter's birthday. we used to love this restaurant and named it one of the best in singapore. however, the recent experience was rather disappointing. the tasting menu food was poorly executed and left the rest of the family hungry. however, the bonus was the bread and the vegetarian menu. hope to have a better experience the next time :

Iggy'sHilton HotelSingaporeHaven't been here for many years.First time it was above average, second time it was fantastic and this third time is such a disappointment.Don't understand they earned their Michelin Star.Decor and ambience plain.Tableware plain.Food so so. Nothing memorable.Main was Hidea Wagyu Sirloin - served medium rare, wasn't really warm

Even though this restaurant not in the top 50 restaurant in Tripadvisor of Singapore, it's one of the top 50 restaurants in Asia. I found pretty extreme reviews of Iggy's that make me want to find out what exactly the quality it is.Me n my husband went there for lunch and we both order tasting menu, which cost much higher than 4 course menu but most of the dishes are the same, only the crab meat and the fish ( I forgot what kind of fish ) are the extra dishes of tasting lunch menu but both were not interesting. Especially the fish taste fishy and totally off! Only the Wagyu beef up to standard. The dessert is safe and tasty but no surprise. We all both know mango and coconut are both good friends, can't be wrong. The room setting is weird vibe, around 5 tables in a small room. There're only 3 tables include us booked in that small room , the table next to us were 4 ladies and had fun talk, I don't blame them to make the place noisy , I blame the restaurant setting shouldn't pack all the tables in a small space if there're more than 1 room. Kitchen door just next to our table, so the waitress keep going in and out in front of us. I can understand that's normal if that is a fast food restaurant or local restaurant but should't happen like this in a "fancy" restaurant. Because the room ( main restaurant) is small, even though those waiter and waitress standing at the corner and against the walls, they are actually pretty close to us and made us quite uncomfortable. Imagine there're 4 security guards watching you when you having your food. Overall, I will not recommend anyone to come Iggy's! Very expensive but the food doesn't worth the price
3
Expected so much but turned out to be so average, no idea how they ever made it to the TOP 50 list of restaurants. From cold food to ......
5
Never disappointed. Fantastic food, flavours and textures. Not cheap but worth the splurge. Great for company dinners, very impressive presentation and service.
5
Sat down for lunch at Iggy's yesterday, and enjoyed their 4-5 course lunch menu. We were sat in a private room (as there were a few of us sitting down for a meeting) and found the whole experience brilliant. The lunch menu was excellent and very well balanced. It began with interesting snacks, and followed by a very balanced menu that showcased great vegetables and high-quality meats. The deserts and petit fours were a real highlight. I would highly recommend Iggy's for a working lunch - great food, with impeccable service that allow you to savor everything within an hour
1
We thought we would try given it's past high rating, but we really shouldn't have. A thoroughly disappointing experience. It lacked creativity, taste and was a rushed experience, despite its (now realising appropriately) emptiness. Would write more, but the restaurant is just so bland that I feel apathetic even about the review
1
The lifeless restaurant itself is in a room with no windows in the poorly maintained Hilton. Our diner was a DISGRACE. Poorly presented, UNINSPIRED dishes with average service. Neither the interiors, food or service are any way worth the huge price. Whilst here we also dined at Les Aimes which was a wonderful experience and incompatible to the terrible Iggys in all except the price. $650 for 2 people at Iggys with just 2 glasses of wine - was the only creative part of the evening
5
I'm so glad I finally went to Iggy's - for my birthday celebration. I'm not usually a fan of uber-fancy fine dining in restaurants where the dining area feels like a sanctum sanctorum. But Iggy's makes the cut in my book. It is sleek without being pretentious. It offers only set menus - pricey of course. We went for the smallest, a three-course meal (with amuses bouches to start and dainties with coffee to finish). The food was outstanding. Our starter was an arrangement of gazpacho-ish soup with scallops, mackerel, sea urchin and ever-so-slight slices of fresh kobe (or maybe kyoto) vegetables. It sounds larger than it was - the portion was perfect and it was a feast for eyes and palate. I had fish after that - can't remember the name but beautifully cooked with a crispy skin and again a delicate arrangement of veggies. Husband and daughter had drool-worthy wagyu beef. Portions were small and we didn't want to leave hungry so I asked if we could add on anything a la carte (not on the menu). The waiter suggested a small serving of cappellini with tiny prawns. Fabulous and, shared by three, a perfect portion each. Dessert was a work of art. Sometimes culinary works of art are all form and no substance. This one was both - an assemblage of a gold chocolate ball surrounded by beautiful bits and pieces - crystallised ginger, chocolate flakes coated in gold, hazelnuts, chocolate soil (i guess). and as the waiter poured caramel sauce onto the golden ball, it opened to reveal the pear sorbet inside. gimmicky some might say - i found it endearing. even more endearing - we should've been chocolated out by now - was the sweetest, both literally and figuratively, complimentary birthday treat i've ever had at a restaurant - a small chocolate egg, that i was told, earnestly, represented new life, and that i had to smash with a ribbon-bedecked large spoon. this too (like the gold ball) had a delight inside, coconut sorbet. iggy's is a delight and the lovely tina, our hostess, and the wait staff made it the more delightful. the room we dined in (the main room) does feel like a sanctum sanctorum - no windows, low lighting, situated at the end of a long corridor. i normally like windows in restaurants but the meal here was so good i forgot about the windowlessness of it
3
Felt like walking into a box within a hotel. The service was efficient and pleasant. There was something wrong but I just couldn't put my finger on it until the final 2 dishes showed up. An overly dry lean pair of beef strips. and strange looking desert that tasted mediocre.I won't recommend or return to be honest

Location: It's on Level 3 of a so-called 5-star Hilton Singapore, which I would describe to be substantially the same as the hotel in "The Grand Budapest Hotel". Basically, the hotel is super old and noisy. The restaurant is located right next to the "Grand Ball Room" of the hotel and another function room. This type of hotel is non-existent in Hong Kong. To this end, it is unacceptable.Atmosphere: Decoration is simple, which is not bad. Lighting is dim. But the setting of the tables is very weird. The atmosphere is not romantic at all and it is like eating in somewhere like the movie scene on "SAW". The paintings on the wall are like those that you would get from IKEA. The chair that I sat on might probably be from IKEA too because it is the cheapest kind of swivel chair available for sale in IKEA.Further, the automatic doors next to the tables lead to the kitchen. Whenever food is served, the doors are open and you would be able to see the chef cooking. Gosh! I am not Gordan Ramsay and I do not need the setting of "Master Chef" for my dinner. And surprisingly, I saw the chef tasting one of the dishes with his finger on one occasion. The frequent opening of the doors is rather distracting.Food: Food disappointed me most. Most of the plates on which the food was served were plain colour plates, in particular the very hateful black and khaki plates, which resemble the plates I use at home. When I was doubting whether those were IKEA plates, I decided to turn them over, and Bingo! they are all from IKEA plus "Made in China" (FYI: IKEA does sell many nicer plates at a price of slightly more than US$1 or maybe US$2). I would say Narumi porcelain plates and utensils should be the basic of the basic that a hotel restaurant should use. IKEA plates? Seriously I have never seen a single restaurant (not to mention Michelin star restaurant) in Hong Kong that uses IKEA plates, other than IKEA food hall.More disgustingly, I could smell detergents on the plates. What a big disrespect to food! Vegetarians are basically not welcome. A la carte menu does not offer much choice for vegetarian dishes. Food was no doubt overpriced, and as expected, not up to standard. The Black Forest (dessert) which cost like S$85 is much worse than what you get from a random roadside dessert shop in Hong Kong, which may cost you just HK$50 or even cheaper.We also had the sakura ebi pasta which is priced at around S$125. That was recommended by the waiter as the signature dish of the restaurant. Not only is the pasta greasy, it is neither a French style nor Japanese style of food. It is more like local Chinese food (蝦籽麵) which is sold at HK$30 or even cheaper at Dai Pai Dong in Hong Kong or Singapore. Absolutely unacceptable!Service: No difference from other hotel restaurants in Singapore. As usual, bad.One more thing is that there is a VIP room next to the main dining area. On 16 October 2015 when I visited the restaurant, the people occupying the VIP room had all along been creating lots of noise and the level of noise made me think that I was having dinner at a Dai Pai Dong or some cooked food centre. Soundproof is barely minimal.Each of us spent like around S$200 (without wine), and sorry to say, I think ANY hotel restaurant in Hong Kong (even in 3-star hotels) could offer you much better food, and well, at least not food served on IKEA plain colour plates with the smell of detergents

I came for lunch after reading about it in Elite Traveller, and I really enjoyed it. The staff were very formal, which is common in these great restaurants. I thought the food was wonderful, every course gave me a real buzz. Very expensive wine list, which is normal for Singapore
5
My friends wanted to come here, and I could do some shopping at the hilton and 4 seasons next door , so why notThey only have 1 set lunch menu, 5 courses. After an amuse bouche, the 1st course of foie gras was ok. Crushed and served in a martini glass, not much foie gras to be had, but fine by me. The next course of salad was 1 of the most colorful and prettily plated I've ever seen. Even made me finish most of the vegetables I don't usually eat. 3rd course of spaghettini was good. The main of beef was excellent and the egg coated with squid ink was inspirational . The last dessert of chocolate was ok and slightly anticlimactic considering how good the main wa
3
Average food in average place.
Seafood appetiser is a complete let down. Fish is not fresh !
Spaghetti is average.
Beef is fine.
Price is above average.
4
It is suppose to be one of the best in the city but I have to say I have eat touch better in at her places.
Small restaurant, loud, service was good and food ok, could have been better. Would I go back? NO
5
I heard good things about Iggy's and was not disappointed! My wife and I had the tasting menu and most courses were above expectations - service very good, small dining room with very expensive food yet worth it.
5
Dishes are very delicately done, the starters and the snacks really wowed us, the potatoes on stones, the Sakura prawns with curry sauce, the ratatouille is just superb. Risotto with pork belly and corn is really tasty and the corn is very crisp. Burnt scallop is very well coordinated with the caviar, sardine sashimi, beetroot and salad.We ordered a medium rare wagyu beef for our main course and it is done to perfection. We are very impressed with the dining experience and each dish showcased the chef's various techniques.We will definitely be back again
5
Among the list of fine dining restaurants I've eaten in Asia, I have 3-4 which are my favorites. This is one of them and it was really good. We had such luck when we were able to see Ignatius Chan who was there during that time. We were able to have a photo taken with him, and he willingly had a picture taken with us; even with the kitchen as the background. :)
3
Experimental food, some delicious (e.g. the beef), some absolutely not up to the price level (the amuses). Quiet atmosphere, with attentive service. But the level of English in explaining the chef's fantasies with absolute below level.For this price it just has to be perfect, it wasn't ... Worst is: it's not really fun to have dinner here. Very formal, no touch of smile
3
I was there with a friend for dinner. The restaurant served delicious food in good portion and presentation. The serving style was like in a high end fine dining French restaurants. However, the explanation of the food was a lot shorter and didn't show the good knowledge of what was served. Good food, yes. Delicious, yes. Good ambiance, yes, Good service, yes. however, it's overpriced
4
I was there in July with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary and his birthday. We had a good experience the last time and thought of revisiting it again. Iggy's serve a fixed set menu (veggie, 5-course, 8-course similar to the 5 but you do not need to choose between options) that is regularly updated and you have the choice of changing some of the dishes if you have food restrictions. We went for the 5-course at $235+++ as the 8-course was a little too much for us. The food was good, interesting blend of flavors and creatively presented. There was a crispy potato shaped like a stone amongst a tray of real stones, served with truffle mayo. Wagyu beef with strips of white asparagus was quite delicious. Dessert was a dish of red berries scattered with bits of red cake and silver leaf flakes. We got a plate with a chocolate bar wishing us a happy anniversary which was a nice touch. Service was prompt and attentive. However, there was nothing to give it the extra edge. The meal was like what you'd get at any other fine-dining establishment. I couldn't think of anything memorable to rave about other than the bill that came up to over $700 for two (set meals, wine, water). Would I go back again? Perhaps, but I wouldn't be overly excited to do so
3
Five years ago Iggy's was probably top of the heap in Singapore, but is now feeling slightly behind, compared to its peers such as Andre's and JAAN. More focus should be paid on making sure the flavour and combinations agree with the palate, rather than overly elaborate plating and attention grabbing combinations. High expectations set by the prices, hence the critique, but a pleasant dining experience overal

Admittedly, the restaurant wasn't easy to locate. But once found, we were led to a simply decorated room. Service was prompt and friendly. There wasn't much of a menu to choose from as only the degustation set (with its vegetarian alternative) was available. Food served was surprisingly nicely presented and the ingredients used were indeed fresh and flavorful. One of the dishes was even served with the broth hot and bubbly right to your table. Dishes were properly introduced and well paced. The ambient noise went up once the room filled up but within tolerable limits. Portions might not be big, but the number of dishes made up for it. We ordered a glass of rose wine which we thought went well with the mix of red and white meats. The Japanese touch to the meal was refreshing. A dessert wine to accompany the desserts would be recommended. Overall a nice culinary experience although the price is definitely on the high side ~S300 per person. But well deserved to be one of Asia's top 50 restaurants. Will definitely go back for the occasional treat to celebrate special occasions
3
Overpriced and not what it used to be. The dining room is quite and secluded. The environment seemed overly formal while the dishes were experimental. Mismatch!
3
I've experienced a far amount of fine dining in the SE Asia region. Although I completely accept that this sort of thing will be more expensive in Singapore than, say, Myanmar, I still think this was overpriced for the experience. I cannot fault the service, and the food was interesting, but it was lacking atmosphere. The restaurant itself is boxed in a dark room within a hotel, and therefore the experience of arriving and being in the room itself feels very enclosed and not particularly impressive. The food itself was quite seafood based, which is not a problem, but I wasn't a massive fan of the sea urchin...If you fancy fine dining, I would probably go somewhere else (I didn't do much review research beforehand, and am guessing you can get more for your money in the city)
3
I'm a frequent flyer to Singapore and it's been on just this occasion that I've tried out Iggy's. Frankly I did expect more innovation from them considering thecompetition they are facing. The offered fares were nothing too deviant or innovative, but they were faultless in its execution. The decor, as mentioned by another diner, is dated. Perhaps I come with greater expectations having just dined at Heston Blumenthal's Dinner in London kast week, and they showed tonnes more creativity at a lower pricepoint
5
There is nothing ostentatious about Iggy's - quiet elegant ambience, efficient competent wait staff, simple design - but the food is just glorious! We started with an enigmatic dish named Stone - This was indeed served on a dish with hot stones. The first reaction was "What do we eat?" But look carefully and you will discern small potatoes with crisp brown skins to delight you esp when dipped in the truffle mayonnaise sauce. The egg and foie gras was a perfect combination. Burnt scallop was memorable. I had two personal favourites - The spaghetti with shirako and yuzu sauce; and the most amazing cheese brioche!Dessert was simply called Red - A feast for the eyes and stomach! This restaurant is a great place for a special celebration that will be always remembered. Not unexpectedly, it is pricey but worth it because of the attention to perfection.

The restaurant looks a bit dated, it is small with a very average decoration, nothing special. Sliding doors opening onto the kitchen are very nice but next to it there is a door opening onto the back kitchen and it is less nice !!! Staff is nice and helpful. Food is nice but very pricey and there is no "a la carte" so you have to take the expensive menu or leave !!!In my opinion there are much nicer restaurants in Singapore

Highly rated so expectation was high. It did not disappoint. The restaurant was full. The service was outstanding but you would expect that from a top 50 world restaurant. I know of people who did not like to "no windows" setting but it did not bother us. Jaan has great views but it felt, intimate. Wine list was extensive with plenty in the upper bracket. Degustation can be a challenge but this was right on the portions and variety and superbly presented. I loved it. Don't look at the bill total

The food is delicious, degustation, only 2 menus to choose from. Meat and vegetarian, which is great, quick decision if you are a meat eater. All meals came out beautifully presented and had great flavours. Excellent wine list, almost too good because of its extensive choice. Service you couldn't fault. This restaurant is expensive so is great for special occasions

With fine dining, I have a preference for places that are not too traditional and dare to take some risks, and my dinner at Iggy's was exactly that. From the chilli sauce that accompanied the "burnt" scallop as the opener, to the quail dish which turned out to be a meatball soup served in a plastic bag, to the stunningly presented dessert of red fruit explosion, all the dishes in the 9-course degustation kept me interested and impressed. If there's a weak point, for me it would be the sawara (Spanish mackerel), but perhaps it's just not my type of fish.The price is expensive ($275++ not including drinks), and on Fridays and Saturdays that's the only option for dinner (except for vegetarian menu that is slightly cheaper). I'm perfectly satisfied with the food, yet I must say that the service could have been better. They didn't ask me if I wanted wine (though they offered water), and at the end, when the petit fours were served, they didn't ask if I wanted tea or coffee, either. The overall pace also seemed a bit rushed (e.g. with the explanations for the dishes). These are little things, but at this level of fine dining you'd expect a faultless service. For this, I can only give 4 out of 5 stars

I was in the Hilton Orchard Road, Singapore on business and alone. I decided to try "Iggys", given the write-up in the hotel brochure explained it was one of the best 50 restaurants in the world. And the experience I had would explain why. It was expensive. There is no getting passed that. But it was worth every cent!They sat me by myself at what could only be described as a mood-lit, wooden "sushi bar", but behind which was a stainless steel kitchen work area. Everyone else was going into the main dining room (which I didn't get to see) but being alone I was glad they'd thought to sit me somewhere intimate rather being the "table for one"! During the 7 courses a young chef came out into the work area and began multiple experimental procedures using machines and liquid nitrogen etc. I'd never seen "molecular cooking" in action, but here it was in front of me and it was fascinating. As it turns out, she had been preparing my dessert which she presented to me as my last course...and it was outstanding. So perhaps it was the atmosphere they created for me as a "guy eating on my own" but combined with the wonderful food and the attentive staff it was a truly memorable evening!

In the world of luxury restaurants too often you come across a similar one packet per second, and you're confused, and the food at the restaurant one strange resemblance to another restaurant, in another city, in another country, in another continent. I think that what distinguishes luxury restaurants, is the degree of creativity and innovation, sometimes it works, sometimes less. This restaurant - it works.Wonderfully creative chef, and a delicious meal. Most dishes are excellent, although naturally there are ups and downs. Still, there is one major weakness, the-location. I have a weakness to closed and sealed places, and Claustrophobia disturber my digestio

Not cheap and you must book, but well worth a visit if you're a serious foodie and also enjoy your wine.

Service is good. One expects it. I liked most of the dishes (there is only one menu and it was the gourmet degustation? Not the usual degustation- the only choice was either the "non vegetarian or the vegetarian version because it was Friday and weekend?). I think it's good food and very subtle tastes as opposed to strong tasting dishes. I really liked most of them but there were a few that was not great. The wagyu was lovely, I liked the two different tastes of the two different types. I think the plated dessert stood out as nothing special though the macaroons were very good. The wine was a let down. There is no wine pairing. And they serve you by the glass to pair.. given you have only 1 menu for that night, just have a wine pairing to go with it. And it was expensive for so so wine.Was it nice, yes. I think the issue is that for less, there are better places elsewhere in Singapore. It's hard to justify going back there for over $800 for two with only 1 drinking wine.And yeah I had a wedding going on in the next room (the ball room) we could hear it going on.. not too bad but wasn't insulated from it.I won't go back simply because nothing I ate called out to me that oh..I must have more of that!And for some reason their website has been down like for weeks. I told them about it but it seems like it's still down. And there's a reservation charge if you don't turn up. It's $100 so you have to leave your credit card details when you reserve a table

Have hemmed and hawed about trying this expensive restaurant "best in Singapore" b/c of the poor reviews. It's a lot of money to put down to be hungry or disappointed, however my partner was keen on trying it so I made reservations that night for 2. It's located in the Hilton Hotel on Orchard which was undergoing renovations and also had a loud party with DJ going on the same level. However no noise could be heard inside the restaurant proper. There is a bar service room where people are seated at a bar but we were in another room further back. It's a sparse room with white tablecloths on tables and we were seated on leather parson-type chairs. There were the black plastic swivel chairs people complained about at other tables. Service was prompt, efficient without being suffocating. The room was manned by about 5 servers and they did an excellent job of keeping water/wine filled and cutlery available. They only serve a Gastronomie menu (veg or not) and so we ordered that and my partner had wine accompaniment. They don't do a formal wine pairing but instead charge you by the glass ($36) for the wines. The menu changes seasonally so I won't describe it in detail. They start you off with snacks and chips/bread sticks which I enjoyed. My partner didn't enjoy the curry fried anchovies as much as I did. I thought the snacks had interesting flavours and set a tone of what was to come. Three types of bread (with refill) were offered: peanut, cheese and almond. I found the almond dry and crusty (better with butter) and liked the cheese and peanut ones much more. We had a quail meatball cooked en papillote (plastic) with truffles which did not have much scent or flavour. My partner had the lamb and I had the wagyu beef which were good (I much preferred the Japanese wagyu to the Australian and it seemed a pity to serve both when the Japanese is so much better) They had a palate cleanser of gin/tonic and banana ice cream which I loved followed by an unlimited chocolate plate. I'm assuming they think you will be too full to demolish the tray but I managed to sample one of everything (for review purposes of course) The handmade chocolates were well done with the yuzu being a particular favourite. The jelly, marshmallow and chocolate truffle were pretty standard. Macarons (which Eric Ripert got me addicted to) were well crafted with a nice crust and soft innards however only 2 flavours really stood out: salted caramel (I think?) and black truffle. I have to admit the black truffle didn't immediately win me over, but the flavour profile was so true that I found myself warming up to it. This was the case with a few dishes we had. The toro/otoro was plated on cooked onions (I don't love onions) and initially ate it separately but gave it another try and ended up enjoying the combination more than toro separately. Of the wines, the chardonnay initially paired up well with the quail meatball bringing out the butteriness of the chardonnay but otherwise the wines were pretty standard - my partner wasn't enthused. They served champagne with the snacks and no dessert wine so 4 glasses total. Iggy was in the restaurant and spent a lot of time with a table of 4 beside us as well as 2 other tables in the room but didn't come by our table. I guess he's busy but it does seem like a snub to visit 3/5 tables. Bathroom is outside the restaurant and is typical for a mid-level hotel. Because of the party going on, it was a bit more awkward than for a usual night. There were 3 ladies hanging out when I visited. Coffee/tea is also not included in the price of the meal. Total cost for 2 people with only one drinking wine: $800. Overall, I enjoyed the meal. I'm not sure why there were poor reviews. Everything tasted fresh and was well cooked but the flavours were subtle. We were both quite full at the end of the meal. However there wasn't anything particularly outstanding about the meal which makes me want to return. If you're planning a special night out or want to impress guests, then this is a safe bet but in terms of being one of the best restaurants in the world - I don't think so

Dined at Iggy's on Christmas Eve and had the 8 course set menu. I was a little surprised that there was no wine pairing menu, however, the Sommelier did a wine pairing for us using the wines by the glass and it was very nice and relatively inexpensive. So while the wine was enjoyable, the food utterly disappointed. I ate only 4 of the 8 courses. (very unlike me!) There was nothing special about any of the plate presentations, very basic. The portions were appropriately sized but the flavours in each dish were very one dimensional and uninspiring. There was no wow factor to the food that I have experienced at many other restaurants around the world in supposedly the same category as Iggy's. While I could not fault the waiter/waitress service, the food experience did not justify the price paid
3
Well rated but not really value for money. Full house on a Wednesday night, and is quite noisy. 2 menu to choose for non-vegetarian, but not much different. Main course is most disappointed on taste and presentation. A real surprise is the truffle macaron by the end.

I recently had dinner at Iggy's and found overall the dinner to be a delicate balance of flavours and dishes designed to challenge your taste buds and give you a true mix of flavours. There wasn't any stand out dish that blew my taste buds away nor was there any that were inedible.We decided to all part-take in the Dinner Menu at SGD235++ rather than the Gastronomic menu. Guests enter the restaurant through the push of a button and are then ushered through to the main restaurant area, which it appears they set the number of tables and spacing based on that evenings reservations, so you get the feeling of a "full restaurant" once all the tables are full - but I may be wrong, though reading other reviews that said there were only 3 tables, makes me think this because there were 6 tables on our evening.The decor of the restaurant is well laid out - simple, yet chic. The staff are attentive and generally were found to be not too overwhelming, as they did not hover. They would also wait until one was finished talking before they approached the table. The water glass and wine glasses were constantly topped up over the night and there was rarely a time that you felt like you need to seek their attention - nor did you have to send them away.The dishes were a mix of flavours, though I would say the meal tended to be more seafood based than meat. All the dishes were enjoyed and for a gastronomic tasting menu were all portioned correctly, except for the advertised main dishes. On our evening you had a choice between pork, wagyu and lamb, our table settled on the pork and wagyu. As the "main dish" I found the portions to be too small which left you wanting for more because the taste was excellent.One of the dishes is served in a plastic wrap which as my guests pointed out, while a common cooking technique, in this day and age you have to wonder about health dangers from cooking in plastic at such high temperature plus the environmental aspect. Anyhow, the dish tasted great but you couldn't help but wonder what other "things" you had consumed as a result of the cooking process.The presentation of a wine list on an iPad was also problematic and while we can accept the attempt being made to be modern, it was lost on the difficulty on scrolling, reading and finding wines. I also found overall the wine list was very biased towards French wines and well over the top from a price per bottle perspective. I actually struggled to choose a wine because there were many that I had drunk elsewhere at a fraction of the cost.I was surprised to receive the bill and see three things on it that one would have presumed was included in the price or at least could have been better handled.Firstly, while I have no issue paying for a bottle of water, the staff and restaurant should not automatically assume that because one bottle is finished that we automatically want another and then charge for it. If there is a charge per bottle, customers should be asked if they want a second.Secondly, to then be charged SGD15 for an espresso and SGD10 for a tea I thought was a bit over the top when you consider the overall cost of the evening. Other restaurants would normally include that in the cost and there is absolutely no way an espresso is THAT good that it costs 15 dollars.Overall, I found the price to be acceptable and on par for what you would experience at other restaurants of its type if there had not been the automatic new water bottle added and the coffee/tea should have been been included in the overall price. It is this aspect that causes the review to get only 4 out of 5
3
The food was lovely but nothing stood out this is probably because the ambience was poor. We were ushered into an empty room with only 3 tables. We should have walked out then but we stayed. The tables filled up within an hour but still there was not restaurant buzz. I would not go back
4
Everything got off to a good start, cheese bread, peanut bread and water was served promptly, the lump (should not be a lump!) of butter for the bread was too hard!Stone with Fish Parsley sauce: I was both surprised and amused!!!Eel: fresh and well balancedApple Foie gras with Peanut sauce: I don't think that the foie gras goes with the peanut sauce, but the apple goes.Truffle consume: Puff pastry nice and fluffy, excellent consume! I would eat this again and again!Crab soufflé: Topped up with Caviar and Burette cheese in a bed of spring onions and lobster sauce. Complicated dish which the focus should be the crab soufflé. Too much going on I could not really taste the Crab. The soufflé was executed well.Buri: Very delicately put together dish, the yellowtail comes out very well, and works very well with the 3 types of turnip, could have done without the garlic.Cassoulet: Sausage and pork belly casserole, heavenly!!! I could smell the pig even when the lid was on! The pork belly just melted in my mouth! Cabbage and pork belly always goes well. The sausage was a little weak and I don't know what the white kidney beans were doing there?Mont Blanc: Chestnut coffee amaretto ice cream. Good solid dessert!All in all an amazing experience! Good for dates and serious foodies
3
The gastronomic menu included almost only fish. Most of the dishes was just ok and itwas realy expensive!!! More scene then food! Nice service, nice presentation, regular taste. I do not recommend. There are many places on the world cheaper and more tasty and creative then this restaurant

A serious place, for serious food. From the (very) understated entrance, to the long, dark corridor leading to the (somewhat chilly) dining room, Iggy's is designed to heighten the anticipation of the meal. Each course arrives at precisely the right time, and the staff provides a short explanation of each dish. The food itself is a singular experience (favorite: the raw tuna/caviar third course)- each bite made me think, made me consider possibilities, and introduced flavour/texture combinations that I had never encountered. Similar to great arthouse cinema, everything overwhelms and it's only days and weeks later that you truly begin to appreciate (both good and bad) all of the aspects of the experience. None of the food was sub-par, but I certainly preferred some dishes over others, but the fun of it, the genius of it, was that it took a few days to determine which was which. Highly recommended
4
Iggy's had a separate lunch menus for the weekend so thought to give it a try. We went at 1.45pm and they were nice to let us in as well as to be sat at the counter. My first visit was at the dining room and between the two, I seriously prefer the counter. First dish was eel which was fabulous! Didn't quite like the fried fish (forgot what it's called) that came with it. 2nd dish was mock escargot and creme of Foie Gras. My companion loves the escargot while I found it a bit too tough for my liking but I was head over heels for the creme of Foie Gras. 3rd dish Burgundy salad. Loved the salad but disappointed that my poached egg wasn't pretty. It is really nit-picking as it is tucked under the veg but I can't help noticing it. Artic Char fish is quite meaty taste and the flavours blend well but what annoyed me was the cutlery which came with it. I couldn't cut my vegetables with a spoon though the side of it was suppose to enable it for cutting. My male companion didn't have any issues but for ladies stuffing big morsels of veg into your mouth can be unsightly. Duck with risotto cake was an interesting and pleasant combination. Counter conversation with dessert chef was the highlight! Loved the dessert and petit four. They asked if we would liked to have tea or coffee and naturally said yes but wasn't told of the charge of $10++. The way the tea was presented kind of took away the thought that they could have mentioned it. Overall I would say got the Weekend Lunch, light and airy and have the counter seat!!

Food: we had non vegetarian lunch set menu; tuna was very fresh but wasn't really in harmony with the tomato sauce; spaghetti was al dente enough but nothing special about it; my friend had lamb but it smelled; i had fish and it was very fishy; they served macarons and chocolates for dessert, the macaron shell was badly baked although the filling was good. Overall, i was a bit disappointed.Service: OMG! they need to train their staffs how to provide service at a restaurant like Iggy's. I've asked for the wine menu but the waiter forgot about it so i had to ask for it again but then our amuse bouche was served already. They give you a hand towel to wash your hands before the meal but they wouldn't take away it after used! it was sitting on the table even after our first course was served. I literally had to ask to remove it. Decor: was simple and neat, nothing fancy or extravagant about it that's one thing i liked about this plac
3
Comparing this with fine dining establishments in Hong Kong and London, Iggy's comes across as just average. The dishes were not particularly innovative nor even the best rendition of what the ingredients had to offer. For a place that's supposed to one of the best in Singapore, we left feeling unsatiated
5
I'm not sure I really understand (and certainly don't agree) with some of the negative reviews. You have to put into context what Iggy's is and is pehaps aspiring to be. The main dining room is an intimate space but at the same time the tables are not crammed together. The decor is minimalist chic, nicely lit, not 80's style and dark. All very sophisticated and discrete in my view.The reception is warm and welcomimg and the service throughout dinner very attentive with a clear explanation of each dish on the tasting menu as it arrives at the table. Many of the dishes show real invention and some work better than others (but that of course is entirely down to personal taste). Portion sizes are very well judged as in my experience it's very easy to over-do things in a multi-course tasting menu. It was also very evident that the preparation of many of the courses was very labour intensive and time-consuming. A nice touch at the end of the meal is the selection of petits fours which again are delicious hand-made creations.I'm led to believe there are 16 chefs in the kitchen which is quite an army for a restaurant with such a small number of covers.Which brings me to the price. There I will agree with other reviewers that have commented on the expense. Yes the food is excellent and expensive to produce and it is in Singapore. But when all said and done it's more expensive than EVERY 1 and 2 Michelin Star restaurant I've been in (and I've dined in quite a few). When a restaurant commands a higher price than a top London restaurant it needs to be literally one of the best in the world. You have to decide for yourself whether it is or not
5
We visited Iggy's to celebrate a special birthday. The service was first rate and comparable to Michelin Star service. The food was delicious and "clever" with a very nice blend of both Eastern and European accents. We had the taster menu which I would highly recommend. Although there is not an established wine flight to go with the taster, the Manager produced a series of wines which were a perfect companion for each course. The restaurant is quite small and has only a few covers - mostly tables for two and one larger table. We were a threesome on one of the smaller tables which worked very well
3
Was looking forward to be wowed by the gastronomic experience since we heard many good things about iggy, but i have to say both me and husband were unimpressed. The new iggy's is located in hilton with a very dark and small dining area. We find it hard to hold a private conversation due to the close proximity of the next table and service staff. The food was what we would describe as pretentious, lack of ingenuity and simply bland. my husband did not even finish his pasta. The service was friendly and adequate, but we wished they did not mumble through the explanation of each course. It was an okay experience but i would not recommend to anyone, food was so-so and the ambiance not suitable for a romantic date. There are many other better restaurants for the same price range
3
Iggy's was a disappointment and did not exceed our expectations. The restaurant is small and with no windows felt dark. It almost has a 80's interior that does not compete with all the other great restaurants in Singapore. The food was good but nothing was overly compelling and we walked out thinking that was a large bill for an average meal. I will say on the positive that service was excellent. I think one can do much better in Singapore and I would recommend one miss Iggy's
3
the dining room is small and has no window. the food itself was ok. i wasn't particularly impressed about anything, except may be the risotto. i probably could see myself going back. but i wouldn't make an effort to go back. service is top notched though
5
The ambience is good although the place is not spacious for my preference. But the limited number of seating makes it possible to hang around for hours chit chatting. Food is fantastic so are the wines. Very friendly service, and very helpful at all times.Easy access to taxi as it is located in a hotel. Or alternatively we could get some fresh air and go for a walk along orchard road
3
I was told by a Singaporean friend that this was the most exciting restaurant in Singapore...so we went with my wife, with great anticipation, knowing that Singapore has a world record of top chef...and we were very disappointed...it is mostly what I call "pretentious" cuisine...trying to impress by mixing up unusual ingredients, (mozarella, yuzu, radish, caviar and a few other unknown items) to look "creative", but the result does not make a "plat" it is just a patchwork of nice colors,better to look at than to eat. and some of the dishes were simply banal...scallops over cooked with one potato and absolutely no seasoning...for the massive price they are charging, you are entitled to expect higher skill and inspiration from the chef...actually I was told that the Chef does not cook...he only has "ideas" and order his cooks to fix them for him...maybe it is an explanation to the inconsistency of the cuisine...the next day I went to a local food market, I had Satay and chat kuay tiao...real authentic Malaysian food...I paid 20$ and I was far more satisfied and happy 
5
Using a wide range of ingredients, with a strong Japanese inspiration and a European touch, each dish comes as a surprise and a discovery. Service very efficient (sometimes even too quick...). It is an expensive dinner, but worth the price.
5
Great Food, Great ambience, Great Service. If you are looking for a great evening with great french cuisine, Iggy's is still a top choice. Reserve early and enjoy the dining experience.
4
It was our second time in Iggy's. We knew what to expect and no window dining room and no food choice didn't surprised us this time. But the setting still is too simple and for a couple could be too boring to spend a few hours in such environment. A few years ago they were bringing the guests for desert to the bar counter where you could watch the pastry Chef preparing the sweets for you which was a very nice touch to bring some kind of entertainment to your dining experience. But unfortunately not any more.Regarding the menu they have two sets to choose from (vegetarian $225 and degustation $245). We took non vegetarian option and I must say that the food was very nice especially tuna belly, white asparagus and the fish for the main course. I loved the presentation as well as the taste. The desert, a crispy mille faille with red berry chip was excellent. The service was attentive and efficient. Overall it was a very good experience and a pleasant evening
4
We were looking forward this restaurant and although it was nice, it didn't really blow us away as we thought it would. So in the category of fine dining, we thought it was okay. Such a tiny place without windows it was difficult to see what kind of atmosphere they were going for. The food just wasn't that memorable. Perhaps we are jaded fine diners, but then we ate at two other fine dining restaurants in Singapore which were phenomenal on our four night trip. It just seemed a little bland for me
4
I read so many reviews about Iggys that by the time I got there, my expectations were that this would be one of the best meals i've ever had. Unfortunately it was not. It's quite a depressing atmosphere when you enter, given that there are no windows. We were there for lunch and by the time we left I was disoriented by seeing light.The foie gras starter was excellent. Very crispy on the outside and butter in the centre. My wagyu cheek was average at best, lacking any wow factor that you would expect.My advice, go for dinner
3
I've read countless reviews and was very excited to finally check out Iggy's, being on countless "best restaurants" list both in Asia and globally. We could only grey a reservation for lunch so maybe the menu was different (and this is really the only excuse I can think of, and my attempt at giving the place the benefit of the doubt). But our meal, in a word, was Disappointing.Firstly, I can't stand places where I feel like I'm going into a cave during the day. There is absolutely no natural light, and no windows to speak of. And the long black corridors, funky tho it may have been, did not make me feel like lunching. It's excusable of course if the meal was unforgettable, but it wasn't. The starter was mediocre, the pasta with the truffle was tasteless - even paying for the extra black truffle shavings didn't save it, and the main again disappointing and lacking any kind of unique or discerning flavour. The one saving grace of the restaurant was the Dessert. A modern take on traditional Malay flavours - teh Tarik and kaya toast. That was the only unforgettable part of the meal. Unfortunately it's not enough to take me back. If I'm dragged there again I'll have to try it for dinner and cross my fingers that I have a better experience
5
Iggy's did not disappoint. Its equivalent to the French Laundry (in price, and quality), but much easier to get a reservation. Every course was phenomenal, and a work of art.I had the vegetarian tasting menu, and the sommelier was happy to do half-sized wine pairings since it was such a long meal. One highlight was the housemade egg pasta with a generous portion of truffles. The "ball in the bunker" dessert was delightful to see and eat - white chocolate golf ball filled with passionfruit, which you mixed with some kind of cream topped with some kind of crunchy cereal.The restaurant only has about 10 tables in it, so definitely make a reservation. The silent glass doors to the kitchen would provide a glimpse of the action, and would occasionally go from frosted to clear for extended viewing. This was a nice touch
4
Having been to Iggy's when it was at its previous home in the Regent Hotel, I was sufficiently underwhelmed to not consider it again. A last minute hitch forced me to change plans and I'm glad I gave Iggy's another chance. The food is Japanese inspired with French techniques and, for the most part, executed very well. The desserts, in particular, were exciting, interesting and delicious, particularly a whimsical plate that will appeal to golfers - 'ball in a bunker' which is essentially milk ice-cream, almond biscuit crumbs and a white chocolate golf ball smashed open to ooze a passionfruit sauce. The dining experience isn't cheap but it's a good choice for a special night out
4
This is ranked in the top 100 restaurants in the world, and yes,every dish was excellent. However, I cannot say that any of them blew me away. There are restaurants of this type thatI would not mind paying the high price for dining there more than once.I am not sure this is one of them
5
We had the 10 course set menu and it was divine. Each course that came out was unique to the restaurant and we were not bored with any of the courses. I love going to restaurants where I feel that I cannot get the dishes at any other restaurant and this held true for all of the items on the menu. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but you are definitely paying for a quality meal.
5
I think Iggys's is one of the best French restaurant,I ordered foie gras,wagyu cheek,duck brest risotto that day,all couses totally impressed me!Especially foie gras~
4
Being from the west, I didn't feel the meal was good value. We had the gastronomic menu at S$275 per head. Although the imported ingredients were good, most of my other reviewed fine-dining meals were far more enjoyable (taste-wise) at much lower prices.
5
Every dish was a visual and palatal delight! There is clearly an attention to detail in all aspects of the meal. For appetizers, we had what looked like green stones in sand - perfectly boiled fragrant potatoes in a truffle crust! Capellini with tiny shrimp was delectable - pasta that was al dente with slightly crunchy whole small shrimps. The mini macaroons were a perfect way to end the meal with a hot cup of mint tea
3
I simply hate to be saying this, as Iggy's used to be my absolute favourite restaurant in Singapore, but it just doesn't seem to have the creative spark and stunning control of flavours that it used to have. Last week I ate there for the 4th time, previously a couple of years ago, and each of two years before that. First couple of times blew me away. I can still remember some of the dishes. Now it just seems overpriced and a little middle of the road. Particularly for dinner the prices are of a level that you expect to be blown away by pretty much everything. Instead two or three courses are like that and the rest is somewhat forgettable. My fellow eaters - who also shared those previous meals - agree. Such a shame. Perhaps this is just a fallow patch and it can regain its former glory. I hope so
2
OK, maybe it was a bad evening or maybe we are simply too pampered but our last visit at Iggy's did not leave us with tears of happiness. We had visited the restaurant in 2009 and were always planning to come back. At 845$ for two, this is not the place we go to every week end so we were looking forward to a repeat visit.The restaurant offers 2 menu, a regular Gastronomic and a Vegetarian option. I felt sorry for the vegetarians because the dishes I had from the vegetarian menu (I don't take fish nor seafood) were hardly inspired, if Allain Passard can convince me to become vegetarian, Chef Anwar is not there yet.Our dinner consisted of Gillardeau Oyster (nice to look at), Ratatouille (failed to lift up with any point of interest), Foie Gras girolles, winter black truffles and poultry jus.On the foie gras which made the appearance on this dish and the Challans duck, I had the distinct impression that a not so good product had been used. It was rather tasteless and silky. Andre Chiang had a similar creation with a foie-gras mousse and truffles which brought tears to my eyes, so this was a very very pale imitation (why is it these days that I come accross dishes that have clearly been taken from someone else's note book).The waguy beef cheek was very nice and tender. The challans duck could was greatly cooked but with the same slab of unsavoury foie-gras (and trust me, we have eaten a lot of foie-gras in this lifetime).The Ball in the Bunker desert was probably a more satisfying note with Cereal, passion fruit, almond and milk ice cream, all very good.One of the Home made chocolates and macarroons included one with a truffle scent which was a great end to the meal.Service was outstanding, friendly and courteous, attentive but not overbearing.The platting was great and every single dish was worth a picture.The fact that it looks good however does not guarantee that it works on the palate.So it is with great regret that we will not be revisiting Iggy's anytime soon

This was one of the best dinner experiences I ever had ! The interior is minimalistic (the way I like), nicely integrated in the 3rd floor of the Hilton hotel in Singapore. The service style is spontaneous and not like in many European restaurants of this reputation : it is relaxed, efficient and to the point. The way we like it !!!:We had the Gastronomy dinner with some good wines. Of course, this is not a cheap place and count on 400 SGD per person with wine and some aperitif. Though, it is absolutely worth the money : the quality is fantastic, the menu is super creative and surprising and the service is great.We loved it !!

Special occasion demanded a special dinner. Never tried Iggy's before so figured it is about time to try it. Leaving a credit card guarantee during dinner reservation was a first for me - didn't like the idea but went along with it. Requested for a good romantic corner table, and they promised.Restaurant is sited in a windowless corner of the Hilton hotel; upon entering we are assailed by a dimly lit interior with glossy black wall and floor finishing. I fell a little behind in following the waiter so left alone, I strangely felt the decor was disorientating and vertigo-inducing for a split second. Took me a moment longer than usual to navigate my way to find the wash room too.Waiter seated us at a table with swivel chairs. Swivel chair at such a restaurant? The sense of insecurity was already heightened by the strange glossy black decor, now both of us on swivel chairs. Call me pedantic but I have always eaten a meal on a firm seat, be it a stool or chair. Swivel just doesn't cut it because it drifts side to side! Not good. Atmosphere was initially quiet and sombre, until we realised the entire area of about 8-10 tables faced the kitchen service sliding door. With every course that was brought out by the waiters,the sounds from the kitchen come through the sliding doors and are clearly audible throughtout the dining area. Not loud noise, but certainly audible clatter of kitchen sounds. Disruptive to quiet conversations, not romantic. Service is attentive and somewhat formal. Can't be faulted.Ordered the dinner degustation gastronomic menu. Food was the biggest let down though. Expected greater inventiveness and use of ingredients to surprise. But we didn't feel it at all. In fact I remember repetitive use of the tomato as key ingredient in 3 sequential dishes. by the third time the waiter announced tomato, you could almost here us let out a moan - it was starting to be tiring. The rest of the dishes also felt very conservative, very mainstream. Do not get me wrong, the food is very well prepared and presented as I would expect of a restaurant of this standing. However, restaurants in this league need to distinguish themselves by showing creative flair and the love to 'play' with the tastes and textures of fantastic ingredients - it is in this area that Iggy's can continue to improve.Comparing with past great dining experiences at Le Cinq at Four Seasons Paris, Guy Savoy, Equinox, Gunther's and Andre... I don't think I would come again so soon to Iggy's.All in, it was a filling dinner but we were still left yearning for more

Don't kid yourselves. You are in for an adventure with the feast that will be presented to you on this gastronomic rabbit hole. Also don't kid yourselves over how much this meal will cost. You are not going to a family or budget restaurant. For my wife and I this was a one off to eat at one of the best restaurants in the world. Given the reputation of Iggy's it is strange to find it buried inside a hotel and out of the way, rather than be its own place, but the seating is so secluded you literally are shut off from the rest of the world. I can't comment too much, but the reason you are there is for the food, so sit back and enjoy it all. Hang the expense, don't worry about that new belt or dress size and let the amazing staff look after you. The food is amazing, plentiful and unlike some "exclusive" restaurants you leave there absolutely full. The whole theme behind this is that the food is the star. You are there to see the food in all its vibrant, colourful brilliant glory. People have commented that the place is plain, and it is, but I think intentionally so. The complete attitude here is about the food and nothing should distract from that. As far as entertainment goes, the frosted glass kitchen door, as it becomes opaque, lets diners get more that a sneak peak as to what goes on behind the scenes. We did the gastro for dinner. By about the 8th course we were feeling slow and full. Luckily, for me, I wasn't going to eat any of the next course as I didn't like what was to be served. No problem said our staff, I'll just get the chef to whip up something else for you. And they did so, with no problems and it was just as good as the rest.The staff were exemplary handling all questions easily, and being attentive enough without being overbearing. A fine art in this industry. All in all one of the best food experiences of my life
3
First issue was their demand for full details of your credit card when booking. They will charge you for failure to arrive Set inside a hotel the dining area is extremely small and very bland decoration. Plain walls and nothing to distract from the even plainer table area. Food is ultra modern nouveau so be prepared like ourselves to fill up with something after the meal. Staff were excellent and very courteous Be aware that what looks like a marshmallow on the side plate is in actuality the hand towel which springs to full size on adding water. Highlight of the evening
5
We have always wanted to try Iggy's and our 2nd anniversary was a good excuse to do it. We booked and then I started reading the reviews to my dismay. We thus went in with lowered expectations, but even if we came with high ones, I think Iggy's would have exceeded them anyway. Service was excellent (French lady), food was subtly flavourful, and whilst it was clearly fine fusion dining, it seemed very classic and contemporary as well. I had originally wanted to get the smaller menu because I normally get stuffed with 5+ course menus, but their gastronomic menu at SGD 275++ was just right. I highly recommend a dinner date at Iggys
5
After dinner at Waku Ghin the night before - we thought it nice to have a formal lunch for comparison sake. We booked a lunch seating at Iggys - thought back to back would be over the top - next time I would go for Iggys. the lunch was really nice - four courses perfectly prepared and well matched to the wine recommended by the sommelier. We really enjoyed the meal. The location, as noted is not too great, but the small simple room was very appealing. The look into the kitchen was also pleasant - not overbearing but the quick peek on occasion was interesting. I would like to try the full menu next time

My wife and I were a bit apprehensive about coming to this restaurant after the June 2013 mixed and negative reviews. We were however very pleasantly surprised and had a wonderful evening. Perhaps the staff have taken onboard some of the negative feedback as the service was fantastic. We arrived 15 minutes late due to traffic but the wait staff welcomed us in with big smiles and assured us that this was no problem. We were seated in a very modern and small dining room. Yes it had no windows and the air conditioning was on high but we didn't mind at all as the staff were charming and the frosted electronic glass, that changed to clear, allowed us to get frequent glimpses of the lovely kitchen and food preparation. The menu was delicious, very light and consisted of fresh food that looked like artwork on the plate. The gastronomic menu is fixed for dinner however the wait staff asked us at the very start if there were any dietary requirements or allergies and if we wanted to alter any of the courses. Our favourite dishes were the tomato beer (very Heston like!), chlorophyll sea and soil (containing seaweed and buckwheat) and the white peach pre-dessert containing yoghurt and elderflower.The staff were very attentive, refilling our glasses and very knowledgeable on both the matching wines and the menu's ingredients (even telling us how the tomato beer is made!). Also they surprised us with an additional dessert for my birthday, together with a candle and little hammer for cracking the chocolate open. Based on previous reviews we were expecting aloof, unfriendly staff but actually got the complete opposite, friendly, funny and charming wait staff.This restaurant aims to be unique and stand out hence it's minimalistic fit out works and differentiates it from other restaurants. We had a fun and delicious meal, which we'd recommend to others. The bill was high - almost $900SGD for 2 people but as we had matching wines we felt this is on par with other restaurants of the same level in the southern hemisphere.

Iggy’s is located in the Hilton Hotel. Not necessarily a spectacular location. Dinner with some friends living in Singapore. Opted for the Gastronomic Tasting Menu. Extensive wine list. Iggy’s paired high quality ingredients in a creative fashion mixing Indonesian, Japanese, Asian-Fusion and French cooking. The food came out in an orderly fashion with a brief description. Probably left us alone as a group because we were engaged in our own conversation. Would recommend the food and service. I would guess there are so many options in Singapore
1
With all the marketing and all the hype I expected so much more. It was one of the most disappointing meals/service that I have experienced in Singapore. Dollar for dollar the worst value in Singapore.The food was nothing special. The restaurant looks like an office (once you have got past the initial black art decor design and then you come into the dining room with a "oh is that it?".The service for a restaurant charging these prices and needing local custom was terrible. Not once was I asked what my meal was like. When i didn't eat half of the courses/left parts as they were so terrible not once did someone say they would replace it or take give some extra wine/tea as complimentary. The staff seemed to be going through the motions.The atmosphere was dead and the food matched it.......do not waste your money
2
A fine dining restaurant that fails to deliver on any level. The entrance corridor is the highlight of the experience. The dining room lacks any kind of atmosphere with oddly mismatched decor. Robots would have more personality than the staff, portions are small and with food going back no one thought to ask if it was ok? They are trying to be simple and creative letting the ingredients speak for themselves with the flavour combinations being the interest factor. Unfortunately the ingredients were not great quality the tomatoes in the first course lacked any flavour I think hydroponicaly grown tomatoes from cold storage have as much flavour. The best quality ingredient was some very fresh asparagus but it was ill paired and overpowered by smoked potato which was the main part of the dish again the potato had no flavour just that of smoked next course had different ingredients but bizarrely tasted the same. Full marks for preparing a full vegetarian menu just a shame it was so disappointing and the whole experience was so bland.

I had lunch with a client here last month and ordered the tasting menu. I've dined at Iggy's several times in the past and was pleased to return...unfortunately I've left with little desire to return in a hurryThe restaurant has a good location being located in the HIlton Hotel which is on the main shopping strip in Singapore - Orchard Road. The restaurant itself has a classy minimalist feel to it, dark corridors as you enter which then surprise as you enter the brightly lit and warm main dining room. Tables are a little close but nonetheless comfortable however one peeve is the sliding door which opens to the kitchen which kept opening and closing, staff traipsing in and out and this became quite distracting.Service was slow to start, ok in the middle and then slipped again as the restaurant became busier. If the true test of a great restaurant is consistency throughout the meal - Iggy's has work to do.Now for the real test - the food. The menu is a tad eclectic with a fusion of French and Japanese influences but nevertheless makes for interesting reading and promises an innovative experience. Unforuntately as our food arrived, our hopes steadily slipped... Nothing really popped in terms of flavour or presentation, a few weeks on no dish has stuck in my memory and the only thing I can actually remember was the dazed, lifeless and unspired look on the face of the head chef in the kitchen (who I had a constant view of with the sliding doors mentioned above). The chef looked like he had lost his passion and interest and it showed in the food - some was bland, other dishes were a little weird and the rest, plain boring. I appreciate I'm going against the grain given the high ratings of this restaurant in various polss, but serriously I don't get it.I have a soft spot for Iggy's from past visits where the electic menu always made for an interesting memorable experience...sadly, my latest visit has been a big step backwar

I don't understand the vitriol in some of the other reviews, and they even complained about "dark corridors" and the kitchen doors. The ambience and design is minimalist and stylish, and it's perfectly fine. We had the lunch set, which allows you tochoose between 2 dishes per course. There is also a tasting menu, with no choices. The amuse bouche was the typical sour tomato dish, which was ok. The 1st course of foie gras was good. The 2nd course of capellini with spicy dried shrimp is a favorite of mine, similar to what Ember does. The main of fish was ok, it was sweet, but also still fishy. The dessert of kaya and tea tarik is a creative deconstruction of a local bread spread and drink. My friend had the wagyu cheek main and berries dessert and he liked them tooWe were celebrating our birthdays and they prepared an extra chocolate egg dessert which we had to crack with a hammer. Interesting, but just ok tastingOverall it's very good. Is it as good as Noma in denmark? Of course not. But iggy's is better than most alread

Well, I honestly don't understand what all the fuss is about this very average, but exorbitantly priced dining establishment on Orchard Road in Singapore. Is it a case of all hype and no substance or pretension like The Emperor’s New Clothes?  Let me explain. We had cause for celebration (important wedding anniversary) and as we were in Singapore we thought we'd give this place a try for the anniversary dinner as it's one of only about a handful of restaurants in the eastern hemisphere that features in the list of the 'World's 50 Top Restaurants' . It’s upstairs on the first floor of the Hilton Hotel which doesn’t bode well as this hotel is probably one of the oldest and least salubrious hotels in this part of Singapore. Built in the 1970s it looks as if it’s never had a revamp nor any new decor or furniture in the public areas. It does not reek of opulence - just the opposite really - so we thought we’d come to the wrong place. We hadn’t, - this was it: Iggy’s. Iggy’s what you may well ask? The entrance to the restaurant was just past some tatty looking 1950s furniture one floor up from the less than snazzy hotel lobby. You were then confronted by a what looked like a very big black box with a darkened corridor leading into it with a fanciful piece of sculpture at the end in an attempt to hone your senses to finer aesthetics for the supposedly epicurean delights ahead.  There is a choice of eating at a bar arrangement where you can enjoy watching the cooks in action or eat in the dining room. We chose the latter. This room is by no means large with about eight or nine tables which sufficient space between to engender a feeling of privacy, but not intimacy.  It’s a formal space with a carpeted floor where the low level lighting is provided by subtle wall washers and the waiters wear lounge suits. At one end of the room there is mirrored wall with a display of empty glasses. The walls are bedecked with what can only be described as rather lacklustre artworks. There are no windows and the chairs and tables were definitely not the sort of thing you’d find in an interior design magazine. The spotlights were pointing at the carpet and not focused on the flower arrangements which remained unlit. Where was the supposed sophistication? We chose the seven course dinner and each course was served on a different shaped/coloured plate. Big deal! The food itself was not vey memorablel and when we pointed out that there were bits of shell still attached to the prawns/shrimps the waiter just shrugged. However, the better half really enjoyed the home made chocolates handed out at the end of the meal. The only thing that was memorable was the distraction of the glass door into the kitchen changing from being frosted to becoming clear and with a whooshing sound opening into the kitchen where you could see the cooks at work. I don’t think this actually lends itself to adding sophistication to the establishment. Would we go again? I doubt it. The Scotts Road foodcourt is much more fun and totally unpretentious unlike Iggy's

We were in Singapore and thought perhaps we should try Iggy's, since we had heard good things about Iggy's.The reception area is okay but the long dark corridor is rather off putting and then to be ushered into what appears to be a simple dining room with no windows and very basic furnishings was a tad underwhelming. Not quite the ambiance that we expected.The degustation menu was the only menu available that night and we were okay with ordering the degustation. The wine list is truly amazing not just for quantity but also price! This was the first time I has taken a punt on ordering a $S200.00 bottle of German reisling and hoped I liked it fortunately the answer was yes.Now to the food - it reads well with a certain amount of poetic licence but the reality is that there was absolutely nothing and I mean nothing that stood out. Most of the wait staff just mumbled the ingredients and left. Further the constant opening and closing of the automatic doors to the kitchen was a distraction. Is this suppose to add to the ambiance?On every trip we always try and have one super meal at the best restaurant in whichever city we are visiting actually Iggy's would have to be the worst meal we have ever had globally for the price

Husband and I dined at Iggy's for our anniversary dinner this month. We opted for the 'Gastronomic Menu' with matching wines.The food was good overall - Perhaps, I may have had expected too much but some of the dishes were a bit hit and miss for me. The quail was a tad over cooked and the prawn with peri peri seemed like it did not belong and just, out of place.The wines paired with our dishes were delicious and for me, was the saving grace .. as well as the service which we thought was warm and very genuine.Atmosphere was little 'ho hum' but intimate .. maybe it was just the night we were there, but all we saw was awkward couples/diners either playing with their smart phones or staring at each other in silence. Weird.All in all, none of the dishes I ate were a stand out or memorable, which is so unfortunate because I really wanted to love this place.Also, I really found it annoying that I had to leave the restaurant and use the Hilton Hotel washroom every time I needed to go to the toilet
5
went to this place for the lunch degustation. Food was beautifully prepared with every dish hitting the mark and Iggy's went made homerun with dessert.
5
Everything about Iggy's says striving for excellence. The venue is tucked away in the Hilton. It is tasteful and invites the diner to quietly enjoy the degustation menu which has a selection of beautifully presented dishes which are all carefully explained by a very attentive staff. The other alternative is to choose a la carte . Every dish is stunningly presented. There is a well chosen wine list to complement the food. This is a dining experience which is rather special. You pay for thoughtful food and great service
3
We were 4 friends having dinner and quite high expectations regarding the ranking . First impression about the room (all blind, very dark and low ceiling, small tables and noisy) may have also impacting on our overall finding on the food . In a nutshell it was ok but not to the level of expectations . Only degustation menu which could have deserved a bit more of explanation on the dishes to create a bit more of ambiance. The wine list is good though.
3
Ok so I was in Singapore for one night only and I had to try the best restaurant, turns out according to the 2013 San Pellegrino top 50 best restaurant in the world Iggy's is the number 28. So I went there expecting to pay an awful lot of money (which I don't mind since cooking is my profession and I love to discover new flavors, trends or tastes) and expecting to get what I was paying for.The dining room is very simply arrange and it is great, small numbers of sitting (probably 25) and the kitchen is just next to you behind this -sometimes- see through glass doors.The service is great and very professional, the wine list is well garnished and the Menus really tempting. Then it comes to the actual taste of the food, it does looks great on the plate BUT it doesn't reach my expectation for once called THE BEST RESTAURANT IN ASIA. The flavors are shy, the seasoning is sometimes missing and the excitement that should come out of those dishes is not there! We paid 900$ for two of us, 2 degustation menu, 4 glasses of wine each and a bottle of (of course it is) San Pelegrino. If the price was half of that I think I would still be a bit disappointed. I have been to some 3 Michelin stars restaurant in Europe and Iggy's has the potential to reach this level but the chef need to wake up!( personal opinion, don't get me wrong, i only speak my mind as a Chef and I think flavors and balance were missing)If you want to have a great dinner go elsewhere, if you want to show off to your new girl friend, go there
5
I had an amazing lunch !I love the minimalist decor , very Japanese ...elegant , comfortable .Excellent service , the set menu was amazing ,,indeed again ..some Japanese influences ..every dish was perfect ...perfection with simplicity like in Japan .I will not describe every dish..but it was outstanding . Really recommend . Singapore is blessed with many great restaurant and this is for sure one of the best 
1
We visited iggy's 18 mnths ago and had a great dinner so were excited to return. The service was good again but the food was disappointing.The crab and banana tasted solely of crab, the banana taste was lost and there was shell in the crab, a very basic error. There were unidentifiable purees with the firefly squid dish, the okra with the wagyu dish was slimy and none of the flavours really stood out. The foie gras was lost with the overly sweet covering of the "lollipop" and was frozen in the middle. I didn't enjoy eating sushi with my fingers (not what you would expect with fine dining) and I still don't know what the raw fish was sitting on. The wagyu was red all the way through and so barely heated that the fat hadn't melted to make it super tender .... I eat very rare meat but this was unpleasant. I don't see what peas add to white chocolate, neither flavour nor texture was improved by this addition. One of our party who doesn't eat oysters (or tuna, which was the alternative) was presented with a plate of chlorophyll, aka greens.... really? Even the green tea that I finished with was so strong that it was dark green and undrinkable. The coffee was overly bitter and unpleasant too.The upside was the pineapple dessert, which was delicious.Very disappointed, will not be returning, and do not recommend, sorry
3
Was disappointed with the overall experience. Very average.Spoke to two reservationists over the phone and they could not tell me what the Valentine Day's menu was - until prompted to check!Throughout the meal, was not welcomed or greeted by name, no quality check, no personalisation of service. Highly impersonal service.Service is far from what is expected at this level of restaurant. Staff announcing the various courses spoke rather loudly yet mumbled such that could not get what he was trying to say. Was surprised they expected us to know that we should be using fingers to consume the appetiser sushi. Did not offer my wife bag service and we had to ask.Music was inaudible and atmosphere was cold.Nobody (reservationist, servers, menu) explained that this was a Japanese style VD lunch. Was surprised that many of the courses had raw food in tiny morsels.At $125++ for lunch, they still charge for coffee and tea. I wouldn't mind if the experience was much better.The ingredients were rare and of good quality (e.g. cod's milt, foie gras, quail) but the overall experience was disappointing.Decor mostly zen but the hostess counter was light wood with CNY decorations - looks cheap
5
A classy, healthy, sumptuous business lunch set amid minimalist decor. I love Asian food. And I love minimalist Japanese design. So this place really did it for me. The chef serves a unique set meal each day. On our visit, we had: baby tomatoes with a gespacho sorbet (palette cleanser), followed by a slab of foie gras with sliced pear (starter). Main was a cappelinni with ebi, followed by red rockfish topped with Spanish ham and finely diced mixed veggies. Dessert included dollops of chocolate and hazelnut ice cream. The staff was formal and professional, while also kind and flexible. One of our party had anti-gluten dietary requirements, which the Iggy's team gladly and easily accommodated. They are flexible when requesting "off menu" options.At SG$85 per head, this is great value by Singapore standards. Excellent food. Excellent service. Excellent decor.If you want a burger, seek other shores. This is modern Asian dining at its finest
3
We had the tasting menu and a bottle of wine. $S1000 for 3 people. If the price was not so high I might have rated it a 4 but the value component was not there.We had some wonderful dishes and some that were really average. At a restaurant of the caliber I would expect everything to be great and at the very least good - but average is not acceptable.The setting is also not very inspiring. Iggy himself is a delight.We were quite disappointed for the "Best restaurant in Asia
5
I've been to Iggy's several times over the past 5 years and each time I am more and more impressed. The recent change to the Hilton hasn't spoilt what is a unique dining experience. Menu is always evolving, but they can also do dishes on demand such as their ebi cappelini. Worth every cent
5
My girlfriend's birthday was in December, so despite the wide choices available for fine dining, we decided on Iggy's. We do not regret our choice one bit. We have eaten at the "highly acclaimed" restaurants at MBS and RWS and along the Fullerton area, but Iggy's takes the cake. Food quality was excellent, even a mere tomato had natural flavors that many other places lack (because they don't bother placing enough importance on the natural flavors of the raw products).
2
We had high expectations for IGGY's as it's ranked in Top 50 best restaurants in the world. Here is a summary of what we experienced:Atmosphere: Dark, stylish & modern setting. The way they arranged the tables feels a bit random to us. Beware that the restaurant is very cold! It was actually too cold in my opinion as most ladies needed to wrap themselves in either cardigan or scarf. I was surprised to see that they set the temperature at 17 C!Service: it was ok but nothing special really. The waiters were nice but they were not smooth operators. They forgot to ask us about the wine so eventually we had to ask them for the wine. Also, we feel like they didn't give us enough time to relax when we just arrived and between courses - a little bit of 'rush' kind of feeling.Food: A bit tricky here - I thought it was ok but my other half didn't enjoy it so much. We were not given the option of a-la-carte so there is only the tasting menu option (but if you don't like some of the courses you can still change). Prepare to spend SGD +800 otherwise just go for lunch.ETC: we don't like the fact that you need to go outside the restaurant to use the hotel (Hilton) toilet. There were 2 huge parties in the ballrooms next to the restaurants and we had to queue up in the toilet next to the cabaret dancers. What a chaos..Overall: It was good enough to try something different but we don't think it was worth SGD $950 for our bill. We've been travelling around the world and been to many Michelin Star restaurants and we can say that this one is pretty disappointing by that standard

I travel globally on business, and am fortunate to frequent many world-class restaurants during both my business and personal travels. We were spending one night in Singapore after a Seabourn cruise. I had asked a business colleague based in Singapore to recommend some of the "hot" restaurants there. We chose Iggy's for no other reason than it was very close to the hotel at which we were staying overnight. I have to say it was one of my most disappointing dining experiences ever. While the restaurant delivers on atmosphere and interior design (very unique), the service was only satisfactory (efficient, but lacked warmth). I truly cannot find the proper adjective to describe the food...abismal just does not cut it. I consider myself to be a "foodie", but this restaurant, to put it bluntly, is simply a rip-off. The menu was somewhat imaginative, but the food was tasteless. The prices are equal to some of the finest Michelin 3-star european or New York City restaurants, but the food is far from worthy. There are many fine restaurants in Singapore. If you are visiting this fine city/country, do yourself a favor and dine elsewhere. If you live in Singapore, and consider this a fine restaurant, I'm sorry, but you need to get out more
4
We went there for our anniversary and was not totally disappointed. I have high expectations for restaurants that are world class. The food was tasty, service was good, but I've had better for the price paid. It was a pleasant experience but wouldn't be back for more
4
Voted as one of the best and it wasn't disappointed. I wouldn't say the setting is specular for dine dinning but the food is excellent and creative. If you have a budget concern, come here for lunch. if you stay in the Hotel, don't miss it.

I have wanted to come to Iggys for a while. When I got to the front door I was immediately blown away, the colours and tones of the decor was awesome. And the staff were very welcoming. We sat in the main dining room and were able to order our drinks staring away. And we're presented with the menus we had to choose from for the night. We went with the full Gastronomic menu and were glad we did. THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. I love the way the dishes were presented. Good use of great ingredients. And interesting twists on classics and some innovative preparations as well. We were well waited on the whole time we were there. I was so impressed when the glass frosted sliding door Becomes clear and you can see into the kitchen and see what the Chefs are doing it was way cool. I will return to Iggys one day and now I will have the same top class experience

Take the escalator up from Hilton Hotel and enter the charming restaurant. The gastronomic menu was creative and most importantly delicious. Unique serving ware complimented the dishes well. Favourite was the Araguani Chocolate dessert appealing in sight, texture and taste. The price was reasonable for what seemed like never ending pleasure. Fantastic timing on serving dishes meant there were no dull moments of pretentious chatter. Staff were poised and subtle in demeanour. Only wished there was a take home menu to remember the night
1
I can say there are so many people who does not understand good food. No wonder why this restaurant has been rated so highly. Surely the restaurant has a good atmosphere and services, the dishes we had was very mediocre. The cooking technique did not enhance the ingredients at all. Very sad that this is rated as the best in Asia
1
Don't goIf you are a discerning gourmand, or, in any event do not like to spend nearly S$500 person on a sub-standard dinner with OK wine, then please don't go to Iggy's. I would hate for you to have to endure the evening of disappointment and sadness that Mrs Reviewer and I have just endured. The restaurant itself is small. Not "quaint small" or "exclusive small", but "this is all the space you can have small". We were initially seated at a table facing the sliding doors of the kitchen. Less a "chefs table", more a "table of impending doom, plus you won't be able to concentrate on your awful dinner because the sliding doors are opening every sixty seconds and only every twenty minutes will the doors of misfortune yield your next course of culinary discomfort ". So we asked to be, and were, moved. Thankfully. Our dinner was bad enough without this irritation. So to the food.... bad, so bad, so embarrassingly, pathetically bad for a restaurant ranked 26 in the world and charging S$275++ for dinner before drinks. Bearing in mind that we paid the bill and left before dessert (to their credit, they didn't charge us for dessert) it is tough to recount the courses: some were so bad as to be instantly forgettable, and others will stick long in the mind, palette and gag reflex. So.......……on the night we dined (a Friday) there was only the option of the "Gastronomic Menu" - a misnomer if ever there was one – the price was S$275++ per person.There were 4 "pre-starters". Starting off on a good note was the "gazpacho" with fresh tomato, a gazpacho sorbet and some sort of foam, the foam tasteless but at least non-offensive. It was an OK start. Next, perhaps (I wish I could forget from here on in) was sushi with "Iggy's rice". "Iggy's rice" was dehydrated and resembled a 2 week-old marshmallow. It tasted worse.At some point in this cavalcade of unpalatable-ness was a deconstructed nasi lemak. Malaysia and Singapore have enough issues between them without Iggy's getting involved, but this dish is a diplomatic incident waiting to happen. The other pre-starter is forgotten. This is not a good sign, givens that I am writing this less than 2 hours after leaving the restaurant. This review is already too long and I don't propose to devote too much more time to such a poor restaurant, but course by course:Oyster: an oyster is an oyster is an oyster, don't chop it into three, smother it with mint jelly chuck some peas in and hope for the best. No flavour from any ingredients and a sickly texture. Foie gras: poached? really? on a bed of custard? really? There was pike. I don't know why. It was awful. Pork belly with fig: if you want to cook pork belly away from a grill or oven (was it sous vide?) please render the fat afterwards. Otherwise you will be serving a piece of meat that is 50% succulent pork and 50% flaccid pork fat. Also, figs taste nice, don't drown them in cassis until you can't taste the fig, it doesn't work. By this point we had had enough. There were three dessert courses to come, but after three hours in the Hilton's chamber of horrors we were done. We took the bill and left.Dinner for two, plus (average) wine, tax and service: S$ 850. I like good food, I am happy for it to be challenging as long as it tastes great, but we thought that Iggy's got it wrong with pretty much everything they cooked and it was amongst the most disappointing meals we have ever had, anywhere, ever. (service was polite and efficient and the bread and butter was great)

I think the service, deco and the wine list were excellent. The staff were all friendly and knowledgeable. However, the dishes they prepared was controversial. The execution was very nice but they did not necessarily utilized the strength of basic ingredients to it's optimal level. They used quite a lot of Japanese ingredients and they cleverly combined them with other ingredients to surprise the customer but I felt that they focused too much on the presentation & surprise factor and the flavor became secondary thus it was not balanced. I would rather want the chef to focus on the flavor first. I will try it again on a later day as the chef may have had a bad day

I went for my birthday last june and it was phenomenal :-) great service, awesome tasting menu. we had alot of fun!
4
Secluded setting, and elegant surrounds. An intimate setting with few tables. The food here is international and the wine selection is spot on.
5
Iggy's really deserved a spot on the Top 25 Resto's in the world. Food is creative, perfectly executed, and service is flawless. The location in the Hilton is also very intimate, despite being a hotel. Only ~15 tables.
5
This is only a small restaurant in the Hilton Hotel but it is number 23 out of 50 in the world- well worth the rating. Fantastic food, great service
2
Funny, the only thing get my expectations was the bill. Poor is more than i will like.

Having not been to Iggys in a while I found myself going twice in a short space of time first for lunch and then for dinner. One thing always stands out to to me about Iggys, it's better for lunch than it is for dinner. Whilst the menu is smaller there is more choice and it always seem better put together.Dinner however is entirely wonderful as the menu is less 'fishy' than previously which was something we grappled with a little. The wine list is still excellent and the presenation and the imagination put into the dishes is second to none.Iggys remains a fantastic experience but a little more variety on the dinner menu with more regular changes would see the restaurant score top marks. You will not be disappointed however and lunch in particular is outstanding value. We still miss the counter from the old place however

Whenever you'd remember Iggy's, you'd remember how exquisite their food is due to the ingenious mix of ingredients. Forget the setting, forget the service, forget the alcohol. You're palette is here for an adventure! (just kidding, I'll talk about those later). After tasting the first 3 dishes of our degustation, it became a habit for me to look at the menu every 2 minutes!!! It was like new year's eve. You're waiting for something great, but the waiting just gets to you. Take note that the interval between dishes is around 10-15 minutes. Moreover, there was like 13-14 dishes on the list including dessert. To be honest, there was nothing much to complain about the service. Unless you put into consideration that IT IS a Michelin star restaurant, then you could say it COULD have been better. The alcohol list was adequate enough and the setting was just right (Dim lights, quiet, intimate and cozy type of set up). The private room was also good since it provided some form of privacy. The room was designed to make it partially hidden from from the outside- Just how i like it when eating with family or friends. A word of warning for steak lovers, the wagyu they serve here is not as fat as you would think. Though, I really appreciate how the softness and taste were not compromised due to the leanness of the meat. Think of it as sort of like A4 meat. Overall, if may taste buds are craving for another adventure, I'm surely make a detour here again

While we cannot fault anything that came out of the kitchen, unfortunately cannot say the same with the service. It was all over the place and "confused". We've been to other top 50 restaurants and a number of Michellin restaurants around the world. Compare to these other restaurants, Iggy's level of service was appalling:1. No cutlery on the table when our first dish came out. A couple of staff standing near our table were too busy chatting between themselves2. None of the staff asked if we would like to see the wine selection. We had to ask before they brought it out3. Asked the sommelier for pairing wine recommendation to go with the dishes, her replied was - "well, depends on what you like..."4. Had a bottle of sparkling water, when the bottle ran out instead of asking if we would like to have another bottle, they just started serving us tap water5. When they started serving desert we had to remind them about our desert wineTwo things they were good at, very quick in taking empty plates and glasses from the table and fold our napkin neatly whenever you leave your table.It was such a disappointing evening and we could not wait to leave
4
Great fine dining restaurant with a French-Asian vibe. Dishes were interesting without being gimmicky, with plenty of seasonal produce used. We were fortunate to enjoy some delicious truffles with several courses. Washed down with a lovely German Riesling recommended by our waiter. S$800 for 2 people but worth it for a special occasion where the quality, service and ambience will be truly appreciated. The fit-out is lovely although somewhat incongruous with the rest of the Hilton. Only 30-or-so seats in the entire restaurant means the service is welcoming and attentive without being overly formal
3
A fun place in its heyday, now verging more on the predictable and somewhat flat - really miss the old location as well as some of the staff. It may be that the entire style has been so trivialized that Iggy's doesn't stand out anymore. Wine list is still a good stop, some gems although at a (significant) cost, usual for Singapore. Not bad, not great, needs a rethink
5
Have eaten here 5 times and have not been disappointed. Just once not used to the fish ovaries that were served (please tell them your preferences, they are flexible). Otherwise great experience, you can see, smell, taste and feel the food they serve.
4
The only molecular gastronomy restaurant in Singapore. It is also the best non Asian food in Singapore.They are #27 of the S.Pellegrino's 50 Best Restaurants in the World for 2011 & the Miele Guide's #1 restaurant in Asia for 2011 & 2012
4
They have great set lunches. Dinner degustation menu is too much for most people and overpriced.
I do feel that restaurant's standard dropped when they moved from Regent hotel to Hilton. Lost the WoW factor. Probably cos they have many more tables to serve.
5
Hiton Hotel, being my favorite hotel in singapore, well it is still one of the most high end restaurant. the next closest is probably the brasserie @ St. Regis Hotel

I am not an arty farty food person, if you like that sort of thing then it is your choice.

We booked ourselves at Iggy's for our anniversary. The food exceeded our expectations. We had a 7 course gastronomic meal and polished a bottle of Pina Blank between us. The portions of the food were just fine and care had been taken in presentation and preparation of food items. Some of the dishes truly left an impact on us. The service was impeccible and the deserts mouth watering. However the above comes at a price, we ended up paying Sing$ 800 for our memorable meal.

We had dinner at Iggy’s in May 2012. The experience was good but the performance was quite inconsistent. We had the Gastronomic Menu together with champagne, a bottle of Chablis and a glass of red wine.The meal opened fabulously with sushi on “rice” that melted away in the mouth. This amuse bouche was extraordinary in both flavour and texture. However, it immediately went downhill with a deconstructed Nasi Lemak dish. Iggy’s did a quite fun take on this local dish but the curry flavour was overpowering this early in the meal and did not work well with champagne. This dish would have worked better sitting outside drinking a cold beer.Next, we had the highlight of our visit. Oysters with heirloom tomatoes and a gazpacho sorbet. This dish was a true masterpiece up there with the best we have ever eaten.The meal continued with firefly squid (what the Japanese call hotaru ika). This was competently prepared but somewhat lacking in wow factor. This was followed by a very bland dish called “chlorophyll” which consisted of a puree of edamame together with various greens and seaweeds. It felt like a side salad, without a dressing, rather than a separate dish. We think Iggy’s should consider omitting or reworking this dish.After this, my wife had a very good foie gras while I had a lobster soufflé. The soufflé was done well but this type of preparation is a bit too heavy for the delicate flavour of lobster.The next dish was fried amadai (a Japanese fish) with vegetables. The dish reminded us of Provencal cooking but was otherwise rather forgettable.The final main course was quail for my wife and rare wagyu beef for me. My dish looked amazing but had an intense smoky flavour that completely overpowered my taste buds. I didn’t understand why a premium ingredient ended up getting such a rough treatment.This was followed by two desserts, one with various fruits and yoghurt and another with pear and oats. The latter felt a bit like oats coming out of a breakfast cereal package. One of the desserts also contained dill and red onion which felt somewhat odd and out of place. The meal concluded with some nice chocolates and other sweets.In conclusion, Iggy’s is well worth a visit but the restaurant does not reach the levels of the very best restaurants in the world. The service is good and the food experience interesting. We felt that the Japanese inspired dishes were the best (i.e. high quality ingredients with minimal preparation)

I really liked my visit to this restaurant which is located in the Hilton Hotel on Orchard Road, the food was really incredible and authentic. The decoration of the place is minimalist but personally I liked it, especially interesting was the glass door to the Kitchen that was sometimes clear sometimes not and through which you could see the chefs preparing the incredible food. It was booked by my Singaporean friend (Thanks Again for that beautiful evening !) so I did not know nothing about this place before coming here and I must say I have been as impressed as when I went to El Bulli or the Fat Duck for example or as the latest trendy fusion bistros in Paris (Yam'Tcha or Spring Café for example). The Dishes were really tasty and different from anything else I had before, with many plants or flowers included. I was especially impressed by the Gillardeau Oyster and the 32 plants salads that was including plants from the sea and the ground. The last dishes and desert were less impressive tough (Adamai Fish and Pigeon) but overall this dinner has been a Great Experience 
4
We had the degustation with matched wines, it was meant to be like 7 courses or something but with all the little bonus free things it ended up being like 13, all the food was amazing amazing amazing! except for two things they used foie-gras which is unethical and inhumane and i don't eat it and they gave it to us as an extra which was not on the menu and we did not know what it was till i started eating it and realised. and the other thing i did not like was the price, i excpet to pay lots for such an awesome restaurant but $800 for two is a bit ridiculous, their are far higher ranking restaurants in the world at half that price
2
This is my second trip to Iggys and while I was impressed with my first experience, it has gone downhill. My brother and I actually left before we completed the "Gastronomic Meal."I paid our bill in full but I just could take it anymore when they brought our main course, Pigeon, very cold and obvious it had been sitting for some time. I not will not say anything other than the food was bland at best and the service slow
5
One word: Awesome
Add: Heavenly
More: pricey but for anniversary of marriage to my wife; worth every morsel n taste! treat this for the woman of your passion! *winks*
5
Make a reservation at least several weeks in advance and save up some money, especially the wines are expensive. But it's one of the top 50 world restaurants!
3
A strangely impersonal room with rather intrusive muzak coming straight from overhead; some nice looking but poorly lit artwork. Along the wall in direct line of sight a very ugly waiters' station. Why are we all looking at the wall anyway? Aah: it opens and there's a glimpse of the kitchen. Then the door slides shut and it's gone. Is this a good reason to face the wall for four hours? Possibly not.Not much going on in there though and it seems likely we are about to find out that the food is almost entirely mis en place. This is an unfortunate and growing trend at top-end joints worldwide, celeb chefs can't be out at celeb events and cooking at the same time. Once it came the food itself was decent and starred one amazing tuna sushi which blew the rest of the meal away. Otherwise a succession of small things such as you can find at 5 star business restaurants around the world: quality ingredients constructed or deconstructed into amusing little plates. The service was glacially slow, the bill was extraordinarily high and overall experience very largely forgettable
5
Great experience from the moment we walked into the restaurant. The restaurant is a bit dim and decor is minimalist but focus is really on the food, tastes and experience. Set menu according to what is freshest and to chef's taste. Very eclectic descriptions but they were very open to my requests of any foods I didn't eat or wanted to change. The ad hoc dishes did not disappoint so please do voice your preferences. The staff were very good about describing each dish as it came and suggestions on what order to eat it, to get the full tastes. Fusion food with exceptional new takes on cooking and taste combinations. Pricey but service and food was totally worth it. I'm usually a bit dubious about these fusion foods but this was definitely an exceptional experience. Small but decent sized portions and satisfied at the end

As the reviews we had read about Iggy's had been a bit mixed, we decided to try lunch. This was a good way to sample the food without too much financial investment.The location struck me as odd for a fine dining restaurant. When we arrived at the Hilton there were conference registration tables and displays in the lobby outside the restaurant, certainly not creating a relaxed or elegant ambience. Once inside there is no waiting or bar area that I could see, so I'm not sure what they do with customers who arrive a little early - send them back out into the hotel lobby to wait?The food was generally of a high standard - a couple of personal preference issues (I wasn't keen on the lamb main course, my husband was underwhelmed by his chocolate-based dessert) but we enjoyed the food and felt it represented good value for money. The waiting staff were efficient but rather impersonal, and delivered a very brief description of dishes very quietly, so we were glad we had the menu to refer back to to remind us what we were eating.The internal decor of the room is neutral and the general atmosphere was rather hushed. I prefer a little more noise and bustle as it provides a more relaxed dining experience.All in all, we enjoyed our meal but wouldn't rush back
1
Worst fine dining ever. First off it took 20 min before a wine list was offered. i noticed 3 other patrons with the same prob afterwards. Food was very bland except for the starting snack of sushi with meringue. My fish dish had a piece of bone and scale in it that cut my mouth. The French couple next to me had one chicken dish that was raw and uncooked properly. The only saving grace was the desserts. I traveled around the world eating at places like per se, kiku,manresa,benu,fat duck,l arpege,le bernadin and iggys definetely does not belong in the same level as these restaurants. Maybe they have a new staff but tonight was disappointing. Ill be going to Andre tommorow night and hope all goes 
4
Our set lunch menu (S$85 per person) offered 3 choices for each of four courses. We chose the Foie Gras with pear and a balsamic dressing (melted in our mouths), Iggy's famous Cappellini (sakura ebi, konbu & shellfish oil with skinny pasta), Wagyu cheek with Daikon & ginko nuts (a little too salty for my taste but tender and rich) and a Greek yoghurt, lime & white sesame concoction for dessert. The food, as always, was delicious (we're long-term Iggy's fans) but we had hoped for a more intimate, cozier setting with their move to the Hilton Hotel from the Regent Hotel. Alas, it was not meant to be. There are still 6-8 tables in an open room, too open for an intimate conversation, with fairly bare walls (not quite Zen-like, but close). Thank heavens for the carpeted floor. We loved, however, the glass door (at times frosted, at times clear) that allows peaks into the ever-busy kitchen. We'll always go for the food but maybe we can convince Iggy's that the ambience is costing them a star
3
Went there for 2nd time, 1st time was 3 years ago when the restaurant located at Regent Hotel. 2nd time in Feb12 at Hilton Hotel. Having Gastronomic menu this time cost $275++ per person (weekend) , with this price I think there are other better restaurant to serve same quality of food at more reasonable price, ie Saint Julien or Au Petit Salut.Anyway the standard & quality of food is there, there are variety of wine selection and we enjoyed the dinner especially the dessert
5
Went there with my wife for our anniversary and it was well worth it. We decided to go for lunch instead of dinner. The food was superb, and if there was a dish that stood out it was the linguini. The staff were attentive and helpful and I was pleasantly surprised to find the owner come by to help select the wine. The meal was excellent and the overall experience was superb.On the other matters of note - the decor was chic, modern and slick but lacked some character that the previous location at the Regent. This location is in one open room which makes everyone a bit too visible. There are some private rooms but then the charm is lost. The one irritant not related to Iggy's was that I was surprised that parking at Hilton worked out to $20 or so.Needless to say we will be back at some stage - needs to be a special occasion given the pricing

Got the tasting menu and started with the oyster served with wakame jelly, mascarpone cheese and cucumber. The oyster was very meaty, and the flavor of sea hit the taste buds after finishing the oyster, which was great. The second course was the eel parfait with avruga caviar. The eel was smoked topped with with a piece of gold. The dish had a smoky flavor but the parfait tasted a little fishy and a little sweet. The "caviar" was not too briny but avruga is not really caviar, just fish and other products mixed together to be a caviar substitute. I prefer real caviar. This was a little disappointing after the first course.The third course was tomato with salt, a tomato sorbet and a tomato jelly. There was a nice mix of tomato taste in all of these and the dishes were fresh and light. The fourth course was the charcoal grilled kinmedai served with ginkgo nuts and sudachi (Japanese lime). The kinmedai had a good smoky flavor and the mixed vegetables underneath were good, but needed more salt. The fifth course was a pasta dish, cappellini with small prawns. this was the best dish of the night. The pasta was al dente and the prawns added a nice taste to the pasta. The last savory course was the suckling pig which was served on a bed of lentils and onions. The pork was very good and the skin was crunchy and fatty, and when eaten with the meat, it was a great contrast of textures, tastes, and richness.Next we had popcorn and there was a nice mix of flavors, caramel, orange and nougat. For dessert there was the chocolate box and the cashew was good as was the nougat. The mint chocolate was OK and lime truffle was OK. Overall there was nothing bad about the food but nothing wowed us either
5
This was our first time at Iggy's. The food was innovative and of extremely high quality. The whole experience was a delight. The staff were attentive and explained each dish as it arrived.
4
I have always enjoyed dining at Iggy's - the Sakura Ebi Cappellini is worth every bite every time.
5
went to this restaurant and was so delighted with food and service, i really enjoyed it to much and it was a visual treat and a foodies delight. iggs has done a good job, keep it up.

Brrrrrrr : even the Red roses on the Valentine's table didn't take the chill out of the air, the room was positively icy! Iggy's on the 14th February celebrated with a Valentine's Day Menu and at $275++ per person it didn't come cheap : we were expecting fireworks! The tasting menu consisted of a myriad of beautifully presented, small plates of fusion food, most of them worked while some lacked that punch of original flavour that we were expecting from the melding of East & West ingredients. The menu commenced with 5 different 'snack' plates : Wakasagi, lemon looked and tasted like a deep fried whitebait and having waited over 40 minutes for our first bite - and one bite it was - we were a little underwhelmed. The next 3 pieces, Akami, myoga : Chutoro, chrysanthemum & Buri, sesame arrived on one plate : they looked like sushi but the rice had been replaced by 3 flavoured melting meringues .. they were a taste and feel sensation - fabulous to look at and fabulous to eat. Eel, passion fruit (tasteless) was next followed by Wagu tatare (under seasoned) on a Sarawak black pepper crisp (very tasty) and ending with a slither of Fribourg Vacherin which swallowed up the black truffle which came with it and seemed rather pointless. Then came the real plates : Gillardeau oysters with sago pearls,balsamic jelly & sea salad was pretty and pleasant. A slice of superb foie was balanced on a slice of tofu (with some greens and a sherry sauce) : this to me was complete confusion 2 preparations from opposite ends of the food spectrum balanced on top of each other ended up looking and feeling the same while the blandness of the tofu stole the taste sensation and pure pleasure of foie gras we carnivores crave! Abalone, artichoke,pistachio & yuzu kosho worked for my partner but I found the abalone chewy. Salmon with cabbage, pickled cucumber & kimchi was wonderfully colourful and tasty : the sous-vide fish retained the maximum flavour and melted on the tongue. Pigeon, rose, berries & seeds was enjoyable but the extra flavours didn't stand out. Onto desserts .... Flowers, yoghurt, lychee, lime was fine. Chocolate, nutmeg and hazelnut worked except for the dry mini slice of nutmeg cake - a moist dark gingerbread would have worked better. The service was professional but exceedingly slow so much so that, apart from our pre-dinner drinks, in the almost 4 hour meal we had to consume two bottles of wine and copious amounts of water! Needless to say the wine list is amazing; Ignatius Chan, the owner and a well known sommelier knows his stuff. Iggy's in consistantly in the top 50 Best Restaurants in the World which I find difficult to comprehend as, while being interesting, the food missed that WOW factor that other successful molecular restaurants hit. The new venue, designed by Chris Lee was odd and while there was abundant interesting artwork most tables in the room we were in were pointed at a wall with glass doors which periodically opened to reveal the kitchen - that would be fine but as soon as you got interested in what was going on beyond the doors shut again ... it was a 'floorshow' that became really annoying! Overhead music, never a good idea, was slightly too loud and obtrusive and it was altogether TOO COLD! Would I rush back - maybe - but with most of the dishes consisting of tireless mise en place, sous vide dishes and little final preparation I would expect the kitchen to pick up the pace slightly; AND with our bill hitting $1,200+ I would hope the expense account would pick up the next tab
5
It is a small restaurant with nothing spectacular in terms of decorations but a “Zen” atmosphere. The tasting menus can be served also at a bar, which is not a bad choice if your are with a larger group of friends. I went several times for the degustation menu as the restaurant changes dishes based on ingredients’ availability. The food is creative but not eccentric. You can feel that there is a difference in the interpretation of the fusion term between Asia and Europe or US. There is a “home bias” present in the flavors, which make the food extremely rewarding for a foreigner and flattering on the palate
3
The concept and ambience was cosy, stylish, exclusive. The service staff were attentive and very personable, without being affected (which is always great). The food however, was not mind-blowing - and may be because my partner and I had pretty high expectations (it's Iggy's, afterall). It was clear that the menu was well thought out, and the quality of the food was definitely above average (actually, considerably good), but when one takes into consideration the sort of quality the brand name demands - it definitely fell short.
2
Went to dinner there and was shocked by the bland decoration.Had the Dinner Menu and was disappointed with all the courses apart from the Capellini.The wagyu beef was poor (probably a low grade) and extremely salty.If the dinner was SGD100, might be worth a 3 stars but as such only worth a 2 stars.The waiters didn't explain the courses well and they shoved a French speaking guy for the desserts so they could impress us
1
Quite disapointed with this restaurant.Don't understand how it can end up in the top 50 restaurant in the world.The room is average. we were seating in front of the kitchen service door ( seeing people washing plates and glasses all night... )The food was not necessarily great and 2 people over 12 got food poisoning...The service was not great neither... We had to constantly ask for wine, bread, or food..
5
I took my husband to Iggys as a surprise as he loves to try new places. Having looked at some of the over reviews I had a good idea as to what to expect.Location - On Orchard Road in the boring HIlton Hotel and the resturant itself is not exciting to look at. However as I had read some reviews I was not put off and was not disappointed with the food. Only tasting menue available which was not cheap so dont go expecting it to be a cheap meal out it is not. However quality and service second to none and they changed the dishes for me as I cannot eat sea food
4
We started the evening with the sparking sake - a first for us even though we lived in Japan for 12 years. It is quite a refreshing taste and goes very well with the snacks that they offer. The toro sashimi on a ponzu meringue was superb! And the sashimi went very well with the sparkling sake. The other dish that was truly amazing was the uni with awabi. This dish is truly an experience. The Chorophyll dish was very imaginative using only natural flavors from seaweeds to lady fingers. The combination was perfect.The pigeon was also well prepared though the smoked fish dish was a bit of a let down. But the pre-dessert (fruits) and desserts were again outstanding combinations of taste and visual delight.All in all, a great way to celebrate out 26th wedding anniversary
5
One of the all time greatest dining experiences I have had!!At 250 sing dollars this is a bargain for what you get...They use molecular gastronomy techniques more of a add on value to the dishes...Well balanced!!! You don't leave hungry like some other restos that try molecular.Must try in Singapore!
5
We very much enjoyed our dinner at Iggy's. The staff were very dedicated and eager to please. The food was also at a very high standard. I've been to dozens of Michelin starred or San Pellegrino top 50 restaurants, and Iggy's certainly deserves to be in that company
5
To be honest wasn't really that impressed with the atmosphere, was a bit sterile. But once the food started coming out you forget about your surroundings. Truly marvelous and inventive cuisine. One dish was served in a covered bowl infused with smoke, the aroma alone was amazing. One of the deserts had pop rocks - haven't had them in 20 years at least. Singapore definitely has stepped up its game with restaurants in the past few years, but Iggy's is definitely still a treat. I would put it up against any of the starred restaurants in Asia, but be prepared to pay a hefty price for it. We sat at the bar with a view of the kitchen. Always amazes me how calm everyone seems. Clockwork
5
Having sampled the food at Waku Ghin, we wanted to try Iggys. At about $250 per pax excluding wine, I must say the money was well spent. While Waku Ghin was clearly more expensive than Iggys at about $500 per pax, both these fine dining restaurants offer a different and unique dining experience. The food at Iggys is very different from Waku Ghin. At Iggys, they do not use the most expensive ingredients but the food is just as interesting and delicious. You get a variety of flavours from the dishes served due to the fusion of flavours. The variety of flavours you get from the dishes served are very interesting and simply out of this world. You have to try it to understand. It is just too difficult to describe in words.An interesting feature of the restaurant is its kitchen glass door
4
The menu is an 8 course degustation menu. The portions are small but after 8 of them (plus some extras that the chef sent) we were really satisfied at the end.The food is interesting. A blend of exotic components making an excellent combination and great taste.The wine list is extensive and not that expensive.I can see why this is rated one of the best restaurants in the world
4
After seeing Iggy's was the top-rated restaurant in SE Asia, & the 27th in the World (according to San Pellegrino) we decided to pay it a visit.Mixed first impressions - the entrance is stylish and contemporary, but then opens up into the most disappointing & plain dining area I've been in, complete with no windows - this place is clearly all about the food, and not the decor. It felt like being in an old-fashioned conference/meeting room, and it was a shame that the doors to the kitchen weren't permanently open, as when they did open for service, it provided some character & atmosphere. There are only 9 tables which for me straddled the feeling between it being exclusive, & slightly lacking in atmosphere.So onto the food - basically the 11 course gastronomic menu is all they serve at dinner, at one sitting. There are only 8 courses on the actual menu, but there are 2 extra pre-starters, plus the chocolate-box to conclude, which took about 3hrs to get through in total. The courses are well spaced out, not rushed at all, and the service in general was fantastic from knowledgeable, friendly staff. The dishes themselves were interesting... not necessarily my favourite food I have ever had, but certainly an interesting experience. I loved the flounder/tuna/wagyu starter, the oysters with a kind of tomato sorbet, but found the linguine too rich, and the main dessert of goat's cheese and ice-cream didn't really work for me. However, all in all, a very interesting evening if you can stomach the price..

How do you describe Iggys ? – You would have to say stylish uber chic World class designer entry statement minimal contemporary interiors, spacious well arranged tables Cassina “cab leather chairs” all white table cloths outstanding stemware the restaurant is acclaimed by San Pelligrino and the local foodie magazines.  So I decided to put my Michelin food training to the test – I have paid the price over many a year to find the excitement generated when as a guest you exceed your expectations you are taken out of your comfort zone you experience something beyond just food and wine the total assemblage that comes together when master chef meets adoring dinner Back to iggys – Wine list 3 star rated- top heavy Burgundy choices everything that you really could imagine- France well represented most varietiels and regions can’t complain - Sadly a greater selection of New world would have made the list better balanced. Ignatius chan is well know to the wine world and knows his stuff - Food -I broke the rules and the kitchen complied gracefully - the restaurant has a two areas the trendy “Joel R’ type bar seating -where you can watch the kitchen at work and then the dining room - So I asked to select from both bar /degustation menu- I selected my own dishes and did my own wine parings  I was helped and accommodated along the way - I learnt something new when I was looking to order a wine to complement a Iggys signature dish of sea urchin – a sparkling sake was introduced sid not know it existed – expert help leading to a new experience – brilliant! Judgement -Iggys will be made easy for inexperienced foodies and will certainly live up to Michelin Standards - If you see these comments in one of your favorite food mags dont blame me - Happy dining cheer

Having tried degustation menus at other top 50 restaurant, its easy to spot that the ingredients used at Iggy's are comparatively simple. Perhaps that is what makes Iggy's stands out. Simple dishes would require chefs with great culinary skills to bring out the best of the ingredients?For example, the Chlorophyll dish is prepared without any seasoning as the chef wanted to present the greens in its most natural taste. The Capellini which has Sakura ebi, konbu, shellfish oil brings out the umami taste perfectly. Seating area is roomy, service was great, food serving was well-paced. The only setback is probably the feeling that its more worthy to spend the $ at other top restaurants overseas if they serve flamboyant & sophisticated dishes (which is perceived to be more "value-for-money") compared to Iggy's simple & elegant ones. So whether one finds Iggy's lives up to its name depends on what one favours. For me, I'm happy to be able to enjoy more good food at Iggy's in time to come.For details see here: http://yummydelight.wordpress.com/2011/09/30/iggys

I was quivering with anticipation of our dinner at Iggy's - in fact we went to Singapore with Iggys as the main reason. I own a cooking school and have travelled the world so my standards are high. I simply adored every minute of it, the staff were international, elegant, friendly and intelligent about food. Each dish had its own character with subtle flavours weaving around in your mouth exciting different areas of your palate as well as stimulating your eyes and enchanting your sense of smell. The dessert bar a real treat - the 2 chefs attending you were excited too and serious about their stylishly decadent offerings. My mother and I wanted to take them both home! I took photos of everything - SO the tourist but I had to share. Do not look at the bill just think how good you feel

I had been advised to go to Iggys from a chef friend of mine in Spain, and after reading some of the negative reviews, I went there with some reservation about what to expect. I needn't have - it was exceptional. Having eaten at some of the most famous Michelin star restaurants in the world, Iggys is right up there. The food was superb without being too "gastro" wild and i thought the service was around the best I had experienced. My biggest surprise was the pricing of the wine list. Given the exceptional choice of Bordeaux vintage whites available, and the prices they are now commanding, I thought the price points were the cheapest I had seen in a top level restaurant. Please ask for a glass of the sparkling Saki - Unique. well done to Iggy and staff

Have been going to Iggy's for 3-4 years and they never fail to impress.
Although I very much prefer their location at Regent Hotel. The bar seating was cozy, unpretentious and service impeccable.
Favorite dish would be the Scampi & Kombu pasta!

I loved it. The food was beautiful and the staff wonderful.
Simple as that.

Each course is a masterpiece thought out exquisitely. Ignacious' genius spreads to his every staff. Go and be amazed.

My wife and I went to Iggy's for our anniversary and were surprised that Iggy's makes the top 50 list of worlds best. We had a lovely time and the food was good but for the money spent, I should have taken her to our "usual" spots and spent more on diamonds!The service was good and they also provided us with one vegiie course but the room was very dark and lacked what one would expect from a worlds top 50 restaurant.If you decide to eat here, lower your expectations and you will enjoy the food and experience but don't expect a worlds top 50 experience

Not impressed at all? Service poor, starters average, mains good except for the japanese rice(saltish and overcooked). Deserts great! The biggest problem is the attitude of the management? After complaining abt simple cooking techniques gone wrong, the mgt reply was that our expectations were too high!!

As with another reviewer in May, we had 1 night in Singapore.we were on a mission to visit the world's top 50 restaurants and had a stop-over toEurope with 7 hours spare.So what else do you do - the choice is stopping in the shopping centre that is Singapore's airport or take a side-trip to the city to knock off one more of the world's best.We would have been better off staying in the airport lounge.It appeared that the owner had visited the world's best and tried to emulate what had made them successfulThe catch was that he was not the chef so the passion was missing and the ingredients were not local and natural for what he was seeking.The dishes were in their way quality and professionally prepared but nothing that would set them apart.The staff were perfunctory and adequate but lacked the knowledge of European style dishesTheir attempt to emulate the theatre and art of the world's best was to move us to to a seat by the kitchen to watch the pastry chefs at workThe desserts were actually the best dishes of the night but their was no involvement with the chefs. I attempted 3 times to involve the chef in conversation but he had no interest.he was actually from Chicago and trained in Europe so he probably had a better understanding of what the restaurant was trying to achieve but when i asked which restaurants he had trained in, there was little interest in any conversation.There was little point in attempting a shared involvement if our role is only to sit and watch.Other chefs in the world's best have a genuine passion about what they have achieved and want to share it with you.Apart from that, the restaurant suffers by being located in an international hotel - there is no atmosphere and as the other reviewer deecribed it, it is a dark room with no windows.Same as him, we would have been better having a trip down memory lane and seeking out the street stalls where the food and ingredients are more local and genuine and cooked with a passion - not seeking a place in the world's top 50As an aside, the cost was greater than all of the other Top 50 we tried except El Bulli and Fat Duck but did not deliver the quality, value or experience

Celebrated my wife's birthday at iggys. The lunch menu cost a meager $85++ each, with $20 supplement for my wife's wagu tenderloin, they gave me a bottle of champagne. Started our lunch at the main dining room ending at the kitchen's observation table for our desserts. Watching our chefs preparing our desserts (4 different kinds! Texture Temperture Taste, oh mine...) was a treat. Really don't know why are there negative comments here where I really couldn't fault them for anything. Thank you iggys

I am glad I didn't read some of the negative reviews here, before going for dinner at Iiggy's!I found the food sublime and the service out of this world. I could not fault anything. The room was full on a Tuesday night and by the look of the number of peoploe taking photos of their food, they were all enjoying the experience. We were even asked if we wanted to see the Kitchen and the 13 Chefs/Kitchen people there insisted on gathering around and having their photo taken with us!It is a Menu Gastronomique and that was explained when booking. Yes the price per person is high, but with 13 in the Kitchen and 8 Wait staff and ranked 27th in the World, you have to expect the Bill to make you blink. But don't complain!It would have been a good idea to have the Wine options explained, I knew they matched wines with each course, but there was nothing to indicate this. It is probably a good option, as a medium quality red was S$21 per glass.In all a great experience and one I would repeat anytime I get to Singapore. Apparently the Menu changes Monthly

I was at Iggy's last week and whilst the service was of decent standard, though nothing amazing, the food was a real let down. For the price you pay, you really didn't get much. The amuses were flavourless and the food in general not good. Whilst execution was fine (beside the wagyu steak), the combination of flavours in general was quite terrible. Who puts pineapple sorbet with black sesame clusters and a bizarre praline that had a strong aniseed flavour? Yuck!I'm just very surprised they were even voted by the panel member of San Pellegrino Best 50 to be amongst the finer restaurants like Bras and many other. Really disappointed as I only had one night in SIngapore and Andrew was closed that night. You're seriously better off eating at the local hawker and save yourself some $$$ for better things!Also - the restaurant has no windows! Talk about trying to enjoy a degustation meal for a few hours in a dark room with no view. Why they moved to a new venue with no windows I don't understand...

I was at Iggy's a few weeks ago and was totally disappointed. My evening was a disaster from the very second i stepped into the restaurant. I was made to wait for 10 minutes before i was seated despite having a reservation and that the restaurant was pretty empty - this was at 8pm. I was then seated by the hostess (who was not a local) at the counter - again there was no customer aside from my wife and myself. Somehow i cant understand why we were made to wait - perhaps i was a local and not of foreign descent.As for the food, it was nothing to shout about and none of the courses stood out unlike Andre, Wakughin, Les Amis and Santi.At $250 a head, i rather pay $30 more and head to Andre. There i know i dont have to wait 10 minutes to be seated and given the feeling that foreigners (other than Chinese) are treated better. At 9pm a French couple was also seated on the counter and the service level they received (from the waiters and chef) was truly an insult to the Chinese.Apart from the French couple and a small group occupying the room, the restaurant was extremely quiet for a Thursday evening.In my opinion, Iggy's has to buck up or buck out. With such level of service and average food, i truly wish Ignatius and his crew the best

Been there twice and must say that I like it a lot.
Yes its little pricy, but you get quality for it and its singapore.
Looking forward to my next meal there again

We felt the dinner was over our budget, so decided to try the set lunch and we weren't disappointed! Food was excellent - amuse bouche was nice and refreshing, then came the warm bread. As there was 2 of us, and most things had 2 choices we ordered one of each. We tried everything except the Wagyu & the Apricot dessert and all were top class. Service was also great, our waiter explained to us each dish and our water glass (ice water) were topped up as soon as they emptied. We were also asked whether we wanted extra bread.This was the highlight of our Singapore trip - can't be missed! (reservations essential

so many people talk to me about iggy's that it's a waow restaurant, but after my dinner there, the only thing who's making me feel waow, it's the bill...a 9 courses menu, a few molecular dishes not really tasty, a very regular wagyu tenderloin grade..., and the best a staub pot full of rice and a bit of abalone...after i was a bit speechless, but thanx god came the dessert, 2 very good and creative plates, without any doubt. On top of that the air conditoning was so cold inside, i swear that u have wear a coat, for me i had to drink 3 glasses of wine to start to feel warm...hopefully there's the bread serves with most the meals otherwise at the end of the dinner, u're starving...conclusion, way overpriced, over-valued and overestimated

Went there for our anniversary. Food is mediocre, service is shockingly unprofessional. We were handed a tasting menu ( without wine pairing option so we thought there were none. Had to ask for the wine list, waiters were not familiar with the wines. After the snack, out of curiosity we just asked one of the waiter why weren't there a wine pairing Degustation menu. To our surprise they do have it but we were not informed bout it even after we asked for wine list and so on. So the Degustation menu is 250++ with wine pairing is 180++. A waiter just came over and filled up my boyfriends wine glass without his request so we presume it's free refill( turns out we had to pay for it).Waiter is clueless bout the wines, there's a sommelier who will come by if somebody happens to ask bout the wine...Food is very Fusion but nothing to wow about. ( I expect more if am paying 800++ for 2 person.)With the same amount of money I can get 8 course includes cheese + wine pairing Degustation menu at St.Pierre and the Sommelier introduces and explains the kind of wine we're having. Iggy's didn't live up to my standard

I was eager to try Iggy's and my birthday seemed a good excuse, but when we rang to make a booking the hostess said there were no more tables in the dining room. She then did a hard sell on two seats at the bar overlooking the kitchen. I explained that it was my birthday and we were looking for something appropriate to a special occasion. She assured us that this would be a great experience, made it sound almost like a chef's table, a privilege, a place of foodie pilgrimage. Sold.Well, first they failed to advise us that they had just moved premises, so we went to the Regent Hotel (the website still listed this as the address), and were advised by the staff there of the new location at the Hilton. Cue mad dash. we arrived flustered but thankfully, on time.Then we were shown to our seats - curiously, even though nobody else was at the bar, they seated us at the far end, sort of mashed up together, in front of the kiitchen garbage pail. it felt quite cramped and stingy. I have seen the gimmick of seating customers overlooking the kitchen done very well, where it is a kind of a gastronomic theatre experience, but this was just - I don't know. All the cool, fun stuff must have been happening in another part of the kitchen. We saw nothing of interest, except for waste material flying through the air into the garbage pail in front of where we were eating, less than two feet from our plates.We felt really let down and disappointed. For someone's birthday? Really? You think this is good enough?They wanted us to order their squillion-course tasting menu (something else they did not tell us was that they did not offer a la carte, so it was the tasting menu or . . .the tasting menu. Fair enough if given fair warning). However, we were so put off by the seating arrangement that we just wanted to leave. Instead, they convinced us to order from their bar menu, so we got a plate of food. I remember it was tasty, but was really put off by the rubbish being flung in our direction by the kitchen staff. Sometimes it missed the bin, and it would be a little while before someone came over to tidy it up. What a nasty, nasty experience. At the end of the evening, they brought a chocolate dessert we had not ordered, and said it was for my birthday. I had informed them of my allergy to chocolate when I booked. When they brought the dessert, they said, "we know you're allergic to chocolate, but maybe you can give this to your husband."Iggy's, what did we ever do to you

This is a restaurant which you have to go ONCE (perhaps ONLY once) since it is ranked Asia No.1 by Miele. With a price tag of 250/pax, I expected to be knocked out of my socks (if I were wearing them). Well, I wasn't.Of course, the ingredients were the best and service was attentive (a little bit intrusive actually). Overall though the food was good, it did not have any surprising element to the taste. The atmosphere also lacks character. Perhaps I was wrong to demand a more "stimulating" experience for the price tag?..
2
The room is lovely, but the food and service did not please us. There is a set menu of eight oh-so-trendy courses--tiny bits of mostly uncooked food in combinations that strain to be inventive, but in our opinion end up just being precious and pretentious. The service was attentive, but with rather too much attitude. And the bill was a stunner. If you like the style of restaurant that serves a minute, jewel-like bit of raw fish on a big plate, then you might like Iggy's. We enjoyed our evening together, but the meal was unsatisfying. We found Au Jardin and Les Amies to be much better and less expensive (though both are expensive--just less so than Iggy's.

We went to Iggy's for our anniversary dinner in December 2010. As we had heard mixed reviews from friends, we did not expect too much, and thus were most pleasantly surprised.At dinner time, there is only one set menu, no a la carte to choose from. In case of allergies, exceptions are being made. The 8 course set dinner came at S$ 250 + taxes, with only one excellent glass of wine (regrettably, we drove by ourselves). Total bill, including a tip (not commonly done in Singapore, but the service was excellent), was S$ 700 for two.Not one dish is as one would expect. The chefs manage to bring out new and unusual flavours, and uncommon presentations. We were seated at the counter, where we could observe the pastry sous chefs preparing the deserts, and greatly enjoyed asking them about their food once it was our turn to be served. It seems that the menu is changed about every 4- 6 weeks, and even younger chefs may have some input- if they have been doing some successful experimental cooking, their creations may end up on the menu!Their current menu is available from their webpage, so do check out what's cooking- and don't forget to make a booking

Iggy's certainly is one of the top restaurants of Singapore.I was there at lunch time still at the Regents Hotel and got a 5 course meal for 56S$.Ok, it was during the time of recession.The food was simply perfect and the service was very professional without attitudes although I've worn shorts which was obviously not the right dress code. However I did not plan to go there.Note: From 15th of September 2010 Iggy's is relocated to Hilton Hotel, Level 3, 581 Orchard Road !!

On the 3rd floor of the Regent, this is a nice little place where you can sit at the counter and watch your food being prepared, or dine at a private table. The food is quite good. Standouts from amongst our group were the Wagyu Beef. Red Snapper, Iggy Salad, Ocean Trout and Tuna Carpaccio. The service was efficient but impersonal. Overall, though nothing was truly remarkable and we were left waiting for that "wow moment" that never happene
5
Iggy's was better than I was expecting based on reviews in various online resources - the meal was top quality and interesting with excellent service. We have enjoyed fine dining across Europe and Asia, Iggy's certainly ranks highly amongst our favourites.
5
best dinner at a function i ever had. must try: EGG, white truffle powder, poultry jus. CAPELLINI, sakura ebi, konbu, scampi oil. BLACKMORE WAGYU. HIRAME. AND MORE. excellent service.
5
We went for dinner - can't say any more other than, WOW!

Thoroughly enjoyable combination of good attentive service and interesting, delicious food :-)

Great cooking...voted top resturant in SG but no too fantastic for me to keep going back (perhaps feeling it's overpriced...can get better elsewhere)

Iggy's is so inconsistent I am always surprised it has high ratings. One dish can be special and then the next is a mess (trying too hard, flavors contradicting, etc). Biggest issue is that the service staff no nothing about the wines. Perhaps we had a bad server (though we've heard others say the same thing), but our person did not even know what a Sauternes is. They said, "don't think we have that but our chef recommends something that starts with a Y.

In the 2008/9 inaugural Miele Food Guide, which is published here, Iggy’s at the Regent Hotel Singapore was voted the best restaurant in Asia. Not Singapore, not Southeast Asia, but Asia. In the awards’ second year, it came in number two. Owner Ignatius Chan could not have been anything but delighted. But awards such as these may be a mixed blessing: when we celebrated our wedding anniversary at Iggy’s in December, I couldn’t prevent my critical antennae from bristling.  The winning votes must have been all about the food, because Iggy’s location on the third level of a city hotel is ordinary at best.  The format – a prix fixe menu at $195 per head – is convenient for the kitchen, which can concentrate on getting every dish absolutely right.  The December 2009 menu was clever, with hints of molecular fiddling – for example, a tomato gel film adorning a delicious vegetable medley, and the fresh mint gel balls in the same dish – but the foam quotient was not too high.  Of two amuses bouches, the first, featuring sea urchin roe, was more successful than the second, ocean trout surrounded in a cloud of wood smoke: when the top of the glass dish came off it was exactly like inhaling the contents of an ashtray. Other underwhelming dishes included Maine lobster overpowered by its accompaniment of oats, from which a pink oiliness drooled.  You did have to make one choice: between a light and delicious spaghettini with smoked mullet roe and zucchini, and white truffle cappellini for which there was an extra charge of $11 per gram (of truffle, one presumes). We loved the egg dish, slow-cooked in the shell and served in a piping hot pannikin with mashed potato, Parmesan and truffle, and the little slice of Wagyu beef was done to a turn. From a good wine list, mainly French and not over-priced, we ordered a bottle of Pouilly-Fumé from the Loire Valley. It saw us nicely through the meal; but the sommelier did shudder ever so slightly when we refused his suggestion of a glass of red to go with the beef course, which had already arrived. It was as though I’d run my nails down the blackboard of his soul. Service was slick and generally well-informed. When the room was too cold, they attempted to adjust the thermostat. When it was still too cold, they brought me a wrap.  I expected Iggy’s to knock my socks off, and it didn’t. At around $600 including coffees, was it worth it? Only perhaps. Would we go back? Not in a hurry

Truly a dining experience worth having when in Singapore. We managed to secure seats at the counter and were carefully attended to by Nicolas. We had the 5-course meal for lunch. The sweetest slice of seito tomato along with a shot glass of tomato essence was served as amuse bouche. We managed to order between us 6 of the 7 hors d'oeuvres available. The foie gras (which surprisingly pops in your mouth) tops the list. The iggy's salad and clams were close favorites. But even the others (i.e., hamachi, mushroom, and egg) were delicious. The wagyu cheek was soooo tender, while the duck confit was a tad salty for me. Although a confirmed chocoholic, I actually preferred the mango over the german chocolate for dessert. Yes, it was expensive (although not the most expensive meal I've had in Singapore) but well worth it. This place deserves all its accolades

We were so looking forward to dinner at Iggy's, but came away a little disappointed.The eight courses are varied and the presentation impecable but I wasn't blown away. The cost for the two of us for dinner and wine was SG$650 but the most surprising ingredient was using "pop rock" on the foie gras that snapped and crackled in your mouth with each spoon full. Even though its a small area it lacks warmth and the seats at the bar (the place to sit) only overlook the small retangular windows into the kitchen. Perhaps we are spoilt for choice in Melbourne for great chefs and we expect to much
5
I recommend the counter lunch as representing the best value to experience this exceptional restaurant.It is expensive, but it is excellent if you enjoy beautiful food exquisitely served.I believe it is fair to say that going to Iggy's is an aesthetic as well as gastronomic experience.The staff are exceptional- I had the opportunity to meet the chef, who was a very nice guy, and passionate about fine food
4
It's an uniquely Iggy's experience... will definitely return again... Perfect service...
4
Voted among the best in Asia (top5 I believe). French fusion cuisine pretty good but portions are small and its an expensive place. Try the fixed price tasting menu at about 300-400 per pax
5
Superd and wonde

I can't understand people who have slated this place. We thought it was awesome. I booked counter seats (essential) and had a very good value S$75pp lunch. I suppose S$200 for dinner might appear steep.The staff were very good and knowledgable. The wine list is long with plenty of choice yet not much new zealand which was a shame. Iggy's still gets the 5 stars though as the food speaks for itself. Definately simplistic in approach with uncomplicated plates of strong individual flavour. If you like technically adventurous french flair this perhaps isn't the place for you. We had 5 courses each all of them different and all excellent. Mushroom cappucino and rump of wagyu stood out but what musn't be missed was the french toast. Easily the best dessert we've had.If I lived in Singapore I'd be back in a flash
3
If you go to this place the only place to sit is at the bar, to get some atmosphere, I think there are 15 seats. Do not bother otherwise. We were in a boring little room that had three tables for two in it. I could just about see the bar thru the door.They only do a degustation menu, although they do ask if you have any food intolerances or dislikes. I thought the food was only ok, I am sure it took skill to cook the things we had, but nothing really grabbed me. and as for the Wagyu beef it had good taste but was very chewy and sinuey, We had the wines that complimented each course, and these were ok, but considerding the owner is supposed to be the bees knees in the wine industry, they were only ok.I am a bit fed up with degustation menus, and I think I would rather just choose what I want to eat, and drink.I would not go bac
4
i had the set lunch that included 2 appetizers, 1 main dish and 1 dessert.it cost S$55++.worth mentioning are the mushroom capuccino (mushroom soup) and the chocolate dessert. both were excellent. i would give the two dishes a 5/5.i chose the wagyu burger as my main dish. it was ok. i would rate it a 4/5.the other appetizer i got was iggy's salad. it was just like other salads you can get from other restaurants. i would rate this a 2.5/5.in the end, i would not really recommend one to go out of his/her way to try this restaurant because there are better ones than this. although if you are in the area, why not try it? this is still a good restaurant

Been to Iggy's 3-4 times for business and leisure and the last trip there for business made me swear off Iggy's forever. Generally, the food is very good, kinda molecular gastronomy, but it's not the only place in Singapore that offers food of a high standard. A pissed-off customer like me have gone to Jaan, Blu, Ember, Gunther's, FiftyThree etc and the food is just as good, if not better. So what pissed me off was the service. I went there with stomach flu or food poisoning the whole day, so I was throwing up and having diarrhoea. Had to still go to the business dinner. Told them about my condition and all I wanted was soup. They said ok. My jaw dropped when the bill came. They charged me $150 for the soup. When I asked, they said that's their "minimum charge". if they had the courtesy to tell me earlier, I could have at least ordered the full degustation menu, and offered the extra food to the other guests! I was steaming pissed. Never again
5
I think this is a "love it or hate it" place, as the reviews posted to date indicate. We went with our two sons, somewhat by mistake - the concierge at our hotel made reservations for four instead of two. The food was cutting edge, beautifully presented and very, very tasty modern cuisine. Unexpected shapes, colors, and flavours. We needn't have worried about the kids, they were hugely entertained throughout what turned out to be an almost three-hour meal. Our eleven year-old especially liked the "pop-rocks" tart and the "portobello capucino," served in a little expresso cup. It was great fun for all of us
5
My wife and I first tried Iggy's on our wedding anniversay some years ago. Back then we felt we should only splurge at Iggy's on a special occassion. Since then, we think of any excuse to make it back to Iggy's, even a bad day at work is enough to justify coming back. We make it a point to try award-winning restaurants around the world when we travel, and I have to say that - in my opinion - Iggy's trumps them all. I enjoy Iggy's better than many restaurants in London and New York
1
Gastronomic menu of $195++ way overpriced for the type of ingredients they used. Couldnt identify a dish that I thought was unique. Its surely does not deserve the ranking that it has. Bluefin tuna tasted no better than an ordinary Jap restaurant. Worse still , it is farmed. Suckling pig was a big disappointment compared to what you can get at Gunthers. Definitely wont be back....
4
too fancy - small potions
1
Overpriced for very a simple concept... serve very little portions, and keep those rich people who cannot eat a proper meal happy.
Really, I still prefer my Mee Pok
5
Creative menu
2
Not worth the money..food is good but not fantastic compared to restaurants of like round the world and no atmosphere to speak of. Service is mediocre. Go to Gunther's instead.
5
Fine dining at it's best, menu base on daily fresh ingredients and excellent service and atmosphere.
3
The lunch degustation menu is a bit of a hit and miss, lacks innovation by international standards. Nevertheless, one of the better French restaurants in Singapore. Wine menu carries primarily Burgundy selections.
5
Easily one of the best executed meals we've had here. Innovative cuisine with discreet, yet attentive service.
3
very fusion and super expensive
4
Been here once, is "THE" restaurant worth to consider for special occasion.
5
Great new dishes that amalgamate all the ingredients perfectly...The Private Kitchen at Newton is well worth the waiting time...afterall, there's only one table...an unforgettable dining experience.
3
tried the non veg degustation. Flashy but food is acceptable
5
Great food! Great Service! Would go back over and over again if it wasn't this expensive...
5
The most interesting and a true dining experience..... Molecular cuisine that pick all the senses ....
4
Their ebi pasta is really fabulous. And they have a lovely dinner prix fixe menu that's great.
5
Great Menu, very interesting...
5
Worth all 5 stars. This restaurant is world class and has never ceased to surprise us with the quality of food served. Food of quality, integrity and imagination. Service too is excellent. Worth every cent.
4
Good food, nice setting, intimate and cozy. Set menu with interesting East meets West dishes.
5
fantastic tasting menu, creative and perfect match of unconventional ingrdients. Don't forget to go with a glass champagne and a glass of Torbreck Steading! Fine dining at it's best.
4
Went once and tried their foie gras menu - highly recommended for special occasions.
5
I love iggy's! It's consistently good, the waiters know their wine & the food for a change.
