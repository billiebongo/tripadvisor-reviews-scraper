I am so happy that I could enjoy a wide variety of premium salads and sandwiches from Kraftwich. Always delivered fresh and we can even customise the salads we want!

Love the food there. Clean, simple sitting area and itâ€™s one of the best places to have a healthy hearty sandwich! I will recommend it for a good satisfying meal.

One of the halal food spots at Raffles Place. The main draw is the humongous sandwiches (this slice is one of six). I like how thin it is but it is quite hard and dry. Would be good with more sauce.

It's serves fresh and wholesome sandwiches, salads and soups. The sandwiches are one of the best in town - must try the duck and the salmon!

I've only had the salad and it's not too shabby, but the service at the guocotower location is extremely slow which can be very extremely frustrating. I'm not entirely certain that they realize how slow they take and give out orders.

Been here twice because we couldn't find any good coffee near our hotel. Their coffee is very good and they also have reasonable priced sandwiches.

Needed to sit down and eat, managed to find this lovely sandwich shop in the basement and tried one of their kraftwiches which was lovely, very chilled and staff are very nice

Found this cafe close to our hotel. Had breakfast and lunch here. Great healthy choices as well as great coffee and juices. You can order a fresh salad by filling out a form and pay for what you add. Or, grab a great toasted bread slice with fillings like smoked duck, chicken, salmon, avocados and cheeses. Meats of all descriptions. Coffee is hot and strong. This place also has fresh baked savouries, cakes, slices and pastries. Great find.
