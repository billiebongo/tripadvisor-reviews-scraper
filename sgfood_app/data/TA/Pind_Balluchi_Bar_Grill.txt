The main course (Malai Methi Matar and Dal Makhni ) was not that great and had quite a bit of salt in them. The fenugreek in Malai Methi Matar was charred. The starters were good though especially paneer tikka.
4
Overall food is good, service can be improved. There was only one person serving could speak decent English.

Pind balluchi is the only indian food outlet in clarke quay, the food is awesome and great place for a family outing. However i felt it was a bit on the expensive side.
4
Really enjoyed the evening. Great food + service. Quality was v good and on par with some of the high end indian dining in singapore. Pricing was also competitive.
3
Manager gave some terrible excuse about not receiving our reservation via chope as system not in sync
5
Must go.. Amazing food... A restaurant one should not skip... Pricing is not high too.. Very good ambience.. If u want to have good North Indian food then this the right option..

We visited Clarke Quay in the evening. Opted for Pind Baluchi for early dinner as we were craving for Indian food. Chose this based on their reputation of good food in Gurgaon. Ordered Paneer makhani and Butter chicken. The taste of dishes were no were close to the authentic tastes. The gravies were excessively sweet. And that too every thing was priced very high. If we compare this restaurant with Bar Bar Black Sheep on Robert Quay, there was a huge difference between the authentic taste of food.Only thing good was the service and the ambience of the restaurant

I have been to Pind Balluchi twice in Clarke Quay. The ambience is modern, the seats are comfortable and the food is great! The servers were knowledgable about the menu. We had 'dahi ke kebab' which were brilliant. Pindi Choley and Chicken Makhani were good as well. Kulfi-Malai medley and gulab jamun were yummy. The portion sizes were good enough and the price was reasonable. Also liked the mocktails and wine selection. Worth a visit for indian food
4
Our table consisted of 2 Indians, 1 Iranian, 1 Chinese, 1 Greek and 1 American yet all of us thoroughly enjoyed every dish we tried. The restaurant is spacious, modern, clean and located in the heart of popular Clarke Quay. Our server catered to our every need including fast delivery of doubles we ordered when we found really tasty items. Unfortunately I did not do the ordering so I don't know the names of any of the dishes. However, judging by what we were served, I'd say it's a good bet that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu
5
Visited this restaurant and many more Indian restaurants on Singapore... This is the best if I am to compare with raat, sitara balaji bhawan, taste of india... Only one suggestion they can improve their serving pace... Probably I was too hungry... Price is reasonable than Raas..

Food was good.We ordered Indian non veg.For some reason,the restaurant was empty.The staffs are very cordial.Had a chat with the owner

Best Indian food I had in Singapore and every guest was very pleased with the food taste, presentation and service. Highly recommended !

Pind Balluchi is a very respected restaurant chain in Delhi (I'm not sure if this is an offshoot or a completely unrelated). Good place to try some signature Delhi / Lucknowi dishes. Their menu has all the right dishes, but the quality of the dishes is 70 - 80% of the quality you'd get back in India. Having said that, the food here is lighter and lower on oil as compared to what's served at other Indian restaurants nearby. And the ambiance is classy. I've been able to walk in on a Friday evening, but generally a reservation is a good idea. We ate a lot and the bill was around $60ish per person, which was a touch more than what I'd pay for the food. Some noteworthy dishes here are Galouti Kebab (very soft and delicately spiced minced lamb patties), Dahi Kebabs (kebabs made out of hung yoghurt), bhatti murgh (a cousin of Tandoori Chicken), Tandoori Broccoli (Grilled florets of broccoli), Rara Chicken, fish curry and Dhaba Lamb. These are dishes I haven't seen in a lot of other supposedly North Indian restaurants in Singapore.Since I've grown up with the originals, I found the Galouti Kebab and Dahi kebab good, but underwhelming. For first timers, certainly a must try. The tandoori broccoli was succulent and retained the distinctive broccoli taste. Bhatti murgh was excellent. All the main courses, especially the fish curry, were pretty good. The Fish curry isn't the kind you would get at most Indian places, it was lightly flavored and tangy and the fist was soft and cooked well. The breads were fresh, hot and soft.The desserts were a mixed bag. The "kesar Rasgulla" was BAD. The "orange rasmalai" was also bad, and had a bit too much orange zest grated in. Stay away from these desserts. This is a classic example of chefs trying to get too fancy for their own good. The mango flavoring in the mango phirni was straight out of a tin. So they managed to ruin three of my favorite desserts by pairing them with unncessary flavors that simply do not go together. The kulfi (Indian version of ice cream) was excellent - and that should be the preferred dessert
4
Another curry club night another good restaurant. North Indian treat some really good flavors and tastes. Great starters with a little spice and the curries and garlic naan were really good. The beers were cold and the service was very good. Its a little away from the hustle and bustle of Clark quay but if you are looking for something different in the curry department this is the place. Enjo
2
We have been here before and the food is good, which is why we returned. Once again, the service disappointed. The manager is quite rude. It's quite a shame as the food is pretty decent. It always surprised me that this was always empty at a location like Clarke quay, even on a Saturday night... I Guess the service might be the reason
3
We have gone to Pind Balluchi twice and the service has disappointed us both times. They're rude, intrusive and don't know the c of customer service. As American Express/palette card holders we were expecting a 50% discount on main courses while they defined what main courses were even though we wanted one starter (which was more expensive than the other main course) drinks, raita and one main course. They literally forced us to order what they thought was main course.
3
The entire experience in this restaurant was average. The mocktails that we ordered were not well prepared and even the Amritsari fish gravy turned out to be salty. The naans and the biryani were good. We chose the restaurant with great expectations, however turned out to be just average
3
Went there esp to have indian veg food. But they dont seem to care to welcome indians.the place was hardly half full and they were least bothered to even offer us water .the table wasnt laid.no mats or cutlery was laid out on the table.careless attitude.on repeated requests when i got water .the glass was dirty. The waiter didnt care to change the glass.somehow just managed to eat the greasy food without proper cutlery.no onions .achaar or chutney.they say all those things are chargeable -evening was spoilt.Singaporeans treat Indians better.i must sa
1
I can't explain how badly the staff has spoiled my evening with my family and 20 months old Kid. I was promised and told that the restaurant is family and child friendly but in reality this restaurant has nothing for kids and family and rather a very simple restaurant. Interestingly when I questioned the staff about their promise over phone, he was more incline towards getting things operational (which means getting order) rather than restoring customer experience. In my opinion everyone has certain priority and when it comes to your special day with family and kids, you would certainly not like to have such environment
4
The food was good (in the case of the lamb chops, exceptionally good). I'd have liked a wider choice of naan, and we had to ask for a bowl of papad (as opposed to it coming automatically). There's plenty of space between tables, and the service was attentive and fast, hence an unstressed and pleasant experience. The proprietor has definitely invested in the decor - modern cocktail-bar chic - not really my taste but it's well done. And the prices reflect that. It was a very expensive meal.However if you're not too price sensitive, want excellent Indian food, and a respite from the zoo of Clarke Quay outside, this is a good choice
5
Excellent food, very filling as well as excellent service, comfy lounge style chairs in the bar area out front, love the idea that you can have a pre or post dinner drink in the bar area. Price was reasonable and definitely worth every cent!
4
Very overly priced, but thats understandable considering the location in Clarke Quay. The buffet option is good, with more options for non vegetarians. Good and friendly staff!
2
Went there as I felt like having Galauti Kebabs, and they aren't commonly available in Singapore. Location is great - right near the cab drop-off at Clarke Quay. The place was almost empty when I went (weekday night), and I was promptly seated. I placed the order when I heard something I have never heard in an indian restaurant before, let alone a fine dining one - sliced onions along with the food would be chargeable separately! For those who are not too used to Indian food, that's the equivalent of a diner charging separately for ketchup, or an italian restaurant charging for olive oil. I was extremely put off from that moment on, as I expect better sensitivity to the diner's needs in a fairly high priced establishment like this.Food was OK (the gaulati kebab was definitely not the best I have had, but the curres and bread were passable), and the service was OK. But when a restaurant plays its location hand too heavily and tries to exploit it's customers who have sat down, by charging for basic condiments, it leaves a bad taste in the mouth
5
We were looking for a quality restaurant and we were not disappointed. This restaurant is located in a very touristy and busy area, but it exudes a very classy and relaxed atmosphere. We had a quiet table inside and we enjoyed a very pleasant dinner. The food was excellent and the service was very professional. Good choice of wines
5
I stopped in to Pind Balluchi and the waitress was very helpful. She explained the menu well and made several recommendations. I knew I wanted chicken so I ordered the Bhatti chicken. The waitress recommended Adraki Aloo gobhi and garlic bread as sides. I can honestly say that this was one of the best tasting meals I have eaten in Singapore over the past few months. I will be coming back many times and bringing my friends.
3
Great ambience, Good food and happening location.For set buffet of an important day like Velentine the restaurant was not well preprared. the attendants particularly KRITIMA was very good and professional. Just two of them handling the entire show.quantum of staff needs to be improved for better good experience.chef advised to restrain on usage of soda in pindi channa. 
5
We ordered standard fare, and the food was excellent. In particular, it is rare to find a restaurant in a tourist magnet that is not trying to pass off fusion cusine. In particular, service was quiet, prompt, and very knowledgeable. I prefer quiet restaurants, and this is one of the few places at Clarke Qual that did not have blaring music.Meal, including drinks, was under S$100 for two.
4
Dined here with my family on a Saturday, way past lunch time and we had the whole restaurant to ourselves. The waiters helped us with our pram and handed out the menus only after we settled down at our table. Certainly, an act that doesn't exist in majority of the Indian restaurants in Singapore (even the so-called "fine dining" restaurants).We ordered lamb chops for starters, soy nugget pulao and cheese chilli naan for mains, pindi chole ( chickpeas in masala) and chicken makhani ( boneless chicken in a rich cream and cashew nut gravy) for sides, and for desserts, we ordered mango phirini ( a rice pudding dish made with mango puree) along with mocktails.The lamb chops were marinated well with malt vinegar and spices and cooked to perfection in oven. The meat was well cooked and the serving was huge. Definitely a starter that needs to be shared. The cheese chilli naan was unique. It's basically a naan stuffed with cottage cheese and green chilli. It tasted tad bland. The chicken Makhani was excellent. Very creamy, rich and subtly spiced gravy and the chicken was cooked to perfection that it was melting in mouth. The chickpeas dish was just average. The dessert was really tasty. The pudding was creamy, nutty and bursting with mango flavour. It's definitely a refreshing chilled dessert on a sunny afternoon. I loved the way they presented the dessert. There wasn't a single grain of rice sticking to the sides of the bowl. Overall, the food was great, service was exceptional ( may be because we were the only patrons during the lunch time?) The price is on the steep side but I think price is justified for the quality of the food served, ambience and service. Definitely, one of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore
5
The place has some awesome food. We ordered Dal Makhani and Paneer Makhani with Cheese Naan... I would rate these in the following orderCheese NaanPaneer MakhaniDal MakhaniThe bill was on an average of 20 SGD per person.The taste was same as that we get in Delhi...Great place if you are looking for Indian foo

Now this North indian restaurant in the heart of Singapore Nighlife capital, Clarke Quay, is a gem. Beautiful fine dining experience with great flavours from norther India. The food is really good, captures the essence of indian spices and presented beautifully. Menu is extensive, and one can choose between a range of Veg and Non-veg dishes. I would recommend to try the Lamb, its delicious. For Veg lovers, Methi malai matar and Dal Makhani will satisfy your cravings. The staff is friendly, but I felt a bit under-trained. Though, it shouldn't ruin your dining experience. Best enjoyable with Family and friends
4
Good food, did not miss Indian food in Singapore. Much better than the so called Indian food served around near Mustafa center
4
Located at the end of Clarke Quay the restaurant is really a gem. The Indian Cuisine is excellent and you can really do a sharing plate with the portion sizes. Service was excellent and sitting outside at this end is quiet - not as loud as at the center.
3
Though the setting of this place is quite good, the quality of food alas wasnt that good. It was quite average and the price was quite expensive. It a quitessential North Indian food and though the ambience of the place is good, the food was a let down 
5
Walking around Clarke Quay found this great place. Excellent north Indian Food both veg and non-veg. We tried Kheema Naan, Chicken Achaari, Paneer Makhanwala and Veg Biryani. All dishes were tasty. The servcie was quick and polite. The ambience sober and quiet in comparison to the other Clarke Quay Promenade. If you wish to have a nice quiet Indian dinner with a few friends in the clarke quay area, this is the place to g

Didn't expect to find this gem in Clarke Quay. Was walking around to find a place to eat and drink and found Pind Balluchi, turned out to be excellent. Very good north Indian food, tried a few chef's recommendation and liked everything (Dahi kebab, chicken bhatti, chicken makhani etc). Good ambiance and warm service made the evening perfect
5
Went there for friends bday. Very clean place with excellent service. It is highly rated in singapore and a classy place. Food is not cheap but with really good. For veggies dal tadka and cholr is amazing for non veggies dnt forget to try mutton and prawn
4
We visited Pind Balluchi at Clarke Quay on 22nd July as a group of about 4. The food served was very good, we tried all their breads and found to be the best in Singapore. The size of the portions was quite good and the taste actually reminded us of the ones we grew up eating in the restaurants of North India. They have a nice selection of liquor at the in house bar. The ambience was very nice with very comfortable seating options. The staff was very courteous and attentive of our needs.I would most definitely recommend this place for authentic north indian food here in Singapore

Pind Balluchi is a fine dine Indian restaurant with tasteful decor and commensurate prices. I visited with a friend this weekend and came back satisfied with my meal. The taste is catered to the international community and hence the dishes were not as spicy as one would get back home. The interesting bit was that they served India's premier wine (yes India too has vineyards). We got a couple of appetizers, the Paneer tikka (cottage cheese) was very tender, just as it should be but I personally would've preferred a bit more spice. The stuffed aloo (potato) was quite tasty. Both dishes had decent portions. For mains I opted for the prawns masala, which again I would've preferred spicier, but tasted good nonetheless while my companion got Palak Paneer (spinach with cottage cheese) which he claimed was good. The food wasn't neither oily nor heavy on spices and hence palatable to most taste buds. The service was very good. Prices are towards the higher end, but that's expected.Do give it a shot if you are craving Indian food in a high end setting
5
A place that visit very often because of the quality of food they serve and the service They provide. I try to arrange all my parties here. It is worth a visit If you are bored of normal service then please do try this restaurant for amazing experience. More over They try to customize the flavours as well (provided it is possible... Specially the spice levels).

Heard this was a somewhat newish Indian Restaurant & we thought of giving it a try. On the whole the evening went off fine with the Parathas, Naans etc authentic but the veg dishes were variable in quality....the paneer dish only so so, the mutter mushroom good & so on. It was shocking though that even onions etc ( very much integral to North Indian cuisine) were chargeable extra & our accompanying Samsung Executive was shocked to hear a new 'promotion' of theirs was just valid Mon to Thursday & we were there on Fri!? ( Sounded hair splitting). Though the ambience on classy Clarke Quay was upmarket with diffused lighting etc, we found the place quite empty when neighbouring restaurants were buzzing with World Cup fever!
3
The fact that the place was empty in a bustling Clarke Quay should have been proof enough for us. While the ambience was really nice and loungy, the food was not really very great. Disappointing at a premium price pioint.
3
We have visited this restaurant few times and finally came to a conclusion that just go for the main course.The appetizers and desserts are a disaster which main course is delicious. The service is slightly inconsistent and varies with the staff serving you. We might visit this restaurant again but only for its main course and its location
5
We were a party of four and were slightly concerned when we arrived at the restaurant to find that it wasn't very busy - not a good sign - apart from a large table of diners who were celebrating a birthday. However we were shown our table in a quiet corner and had a thoroughly enjoyable evening.We were most impressed by the service and our charming waitress advised us on our choices and actually suggested that we were over-ordering and that we should share some dishes. How right she was! We shared a range of starters including kebabs and three of us had the chicken machani which was very good
2
The name sounded good and we had heard about this place so we decided to go there for dinner. The Vegetarian Spread is just about okay. Anything extra that you want, even onions, are charged for.The staff does try their best to be helpful but it isnt good enough as the feeling is that they dont want to really help people
5
We had a lovely tasty meal at this restaurant - well prepared and presented. It's nice to sit outside on the terrace and watch the world go by as you eat. My only disappointment was that the choice of fruit juices was very poor. But the food more than made up for it
4
...home way from home... That is the memory this restaurant's food brings back... Authentic North Indian Food...well done Tandoori Chicken, awesome Daal Makhani, Succulent and aromatic Biryani made us feel that we were dining at any authentic North Indian fine dining restaurant. The rotis, including the Missi Roti and Garlic Naan were as good as it could get.The ambience was very pleasant as was the location central...
5
Having been in Singapore for 4 days we decided to have an Indian meal as a change from Chinese. Went to Clarke quay for pre dinner cocktails & just glanced at the menu as we were walking past, looked good so went back in to the restaurant later this evening.The food was excellent, everything cooked to perfection, the service was attentive without being over the top. They accommodated a special request from my husband for lamb instead if chicken, nothing was too much trouble. It was not over priced & I would certainly return.A illite bit of India in singapore, if you get the chance try this lovely restaurant
5
When we approached Pind Balluchi, on the busy, brash strip near Clarke Quay, our impressions weren't great. It didn't seem that busy and we were bustled through a very stark front area which seemed more nighclub-like than restaurant. And there was one long table of people celebrating a birthday noisily. We wondered whether to stay. But the waitress was charming and in fact our table, nestled in the corner at the back, was actually quite nice. Things carried on improving. The food was fantastic - delectable potato patties, seekh kebabs and coriander chicken, all served in huge portions. Unusually the waitress actually stopped us from ordering more and she was quite right - we had way too much. This is not your average curry house food - instead Pind Balluchi has an interesting menu and some really subtle, beautiful flavours. All they need to do is tweak the layout/ambience and this could be a destination Indian restaurant
4
After reading a review of the restaurant, we went there at about 8pm on Friday evening and were a bit worried as we were the only people in the restaurant. We ordered the Tandoori Broccoli a grilled chicken dish and a lamb curry. The broccoli and lamb were outstanding. I found the chicken dish a bit vinegary and dry but my husband loved it. The service was really good and the decor lovely. The only gripe I had was that there were only three white wines that could be bought by the glass and the one we chose had run out. This really shouldn't happen if you only have a limited number of wines on your menu
5
We were celebrating one of my friend's birthday at pind balluchi last month. We made reservation and when we reached at restaurant staff welcomed us with great enthusiasm. Contemporary decor was add on to friendly and genuine service. But tasty vibrant food was cherry on the cheese cake. We started with great cocktails accompanied with sumptuous appetizers. Tender tandoori lamb chops were class apart but what I liked the most were authentic galuti kebab. Though I'm not a big veggie fan I loved tandoori stuffed potatoes enriched with dry fruits and nuts. Cheese filled tomato salad was just not my taste though. Chicken tikka masala was a déjà vu of "pind da dhaba" and it couldn't get better when u have it with Peshawari and cheese chilli naan ..When Chef presented a special dessert to birthday girl that was the sheer awe moment .. Mango phirni was just celestial to sum up our meal . Except for a couple of flaws it was a unique gastronomic experience for all of us. Thank you team pind balluchi !

I had gone this restaurant as iam very regular at New Delhi In India. It was surprise to see the same brand at Singapore.Well the ambience was far better then what we saw in India. Food was really nice very upmarket. I wish to see the same food and ambience at new delhi.Excellent job. food and service 10/10.Manoj Ra

we visited this place on a Saturday evening. i was expecting it to be crowded, on the contrary, there were a few tables occupied by families.we ordered vegetarian ( daal, pindi choley and baigan bharta) and non vegetarian ( coriander chicken). vegetarian food was great, flavorful and not too heavy on oil and cream. but my companion who ate chicken said it was a complete let down. in the coriander chicken, there were whole coriander seeds- maybe roasted but every time you eat the curry there are a few that you would bite. i guess its different preparation.maybe if i visit next time, i would try something else though this item was recommended by the manager.ambiance is great, location is prime, yet i would rate this place as 3.5 because for the price they charge food could be better.i was pleasantly surprised with "finger bowl" at the end of the meal; since that is not a standard practice in Singapore
5
We visited this place yesterday as we had booking for around 50 pax. This restaurant is awesome in interiors. It's kept simple yet elegant. Service is perfect with attractive wait staff. They serves Indian cuisine and came to know that it's the same chain from India. Food here is fantastic. It has true flavors without any extra oil in it. Galout

An unapologetic Restaurant Manager Akhilesh Rana trying to defend the horrible food with visible hair strands floating on the edge of the plate was the most frustrating experience. A very sour paneer makhani and not so great matar methi malai dish overloaded with threatening level of cholesterol, saggy naan and uninspiring rumaali roti is what we got for a whopping price of Sg $ 145 for a small family dinner. We couldn't eat 70% of the food when my sister found strands of male hair in methi matar malai. Instead of helping and tendering apology the arrogant restaurant manager defending the hair and the horrible food simply disappeared when we paid and left the restaurant . The prestige and the name with Pind Baluchi brand came as an shocking disappointment
1
Ok, unlike the other reviews here, I am forced to give a bad rating to this restaurant. The fish tandoori was cooked with too much of spices and salt and thus you miss how a well marinated tandoori should taste. The galauti kenab was a saving grace as it tasted authentic... Now the most horrible part of the entire experience was the prawn pulao and the coriander chicken. Pulao with mouth burning garam masala and curry leaves is far from any definition of pulao. Coriander chicken was full of coriander powder only and lots of food color. Sorry this is not authentic Indian food
5
This restaurant has, I am told only opened in the last 6 months. It was an unexpected find and one certainly to visit again. The prawn dish was perhaps not the best and I would stay away from the Indian wine. However the lamb in particular and all the other dishes were to be savoured and excellent. The staff were genuinely friendly and efficient. Thank you all
5
Came here with hubby and friends. We had the set meal for 3 people. It came with different types of appetizer and all were a must try. The entrees were equally wonderful. My favorite North Indian dish is butter chicken and they have made it to perfection. The dessert was Ras Malai, and though I am not a fan of this dish, this was by far the best tasting. I would highly recommend this place and would definitely go there again.

We had the opportunity to visit Pind Balluchi for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.When we arrived, it was fairly empty but it did pick up a crowd later.The restaurant is at Clarke Quay, very close to the main taxi stand. The decor is elegant and understated. There is an open kitchen where one can see the chefs at work.The menu has a fairly decent variety without promising everything under the sun.We ordered the Achari Murg as a starter and it was outstanding. The meat was grilled to perfection and the spices were basted on lovingly without going over the top. We were tempted to order another round and decided to avoid gluttony on this visit.For our mains, we ordered Coriander Chicken and a basket of breads (Roomali/Tandoori/Misti Rotis). The Coriander chicken had a distinct home made flavor and was a wee bit spicy. The rotis were all excellent. For dessert, we were tempted by the orange ras malai and we were not disappointed. It was an elegant dish with sprinkles of orange on top and the main dish itself was smooth without being over sweet or creamy.The service was courteous and prompt.As other's have mentioned, there is a discount of 20% that we enjoyed. Regardless of it, this would be a good place to spend a Sunday afternoon
5
Amazing location, fabulous Indian food, chic ambiance - what more do you want. Singapore itself is on an expensive side, so do expect the same from the restaurant. Avg meal would cost around 5000 INR when you would order a starter, two main course, breads, dessert and a beer or a soup. We even got a 20% inaugural discount on our total bill. Mango Firni and the superb location(Clarke Quay) was what compelled us to visit it twice in our six day tour of Singapore. Highly recommend to people, if you are around Clarke Quay and are looking for Indian Restaurant, you cant get any other better place as of now. (Oct 2013
5
Till now one of the best indian restaurants I have been to Singapore. Right in the heart of the city at the 'party place' Clarke Quay, I had food at this restaurants twice on my last visit in October 2013. Tandoori Gobhi, Dal Makhani and Mango Firni ought to be on your order list. Not a very cheap option but you wont regret spending a single penny here. Recommend for the Indian food lovers
