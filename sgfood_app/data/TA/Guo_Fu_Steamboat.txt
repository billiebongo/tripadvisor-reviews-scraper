Easy eating. Cooking your own fine meat and seafood in a broth of your own choice. As much as you can eat.
Having a Tsing Dao beer and Korean Soju.
That is what makes a nice dinner among friends. With talks and laughter.
Priceless.

I like to concept of having a mini pot to myself. Chose Beauty soup but it was kind of bland. The sliced meat were fresh. Staff was polite even offered us the cooked side dishes if we would like some. reasonably price. Will go again

Went to this steamboat restaurant for dinner for friends gathering. There are ala carte as well as buffet price and we have selected buffet. Please take note that soup price is not inclusive and you will need to pay for additional, you can choose the mini pot to yourself or the big pot that everyone can share. If you chosen those with herbs, the price will be slightly more expensive. The varieties of the steamboat isn't that much, with only few cooked food. The xiao long bao is dry with no soup inside, the meat quality is good though. The waitress service is good and always come back to top up our tea and soup. Overall we had an enjoyable time there but it is a bit expensive

The set meal is value for money. The amount of food is enough for one pax.The beef set i ordered is good. The beef is nice and together with some veg, it can fill the stomach.However, to save you some money, I would strongly suggest that ordering the regular soup based will do. The premium soup based cost more, but it uses the same soup based with some added ingredients, which is not worth the money.Xiao Long Bao is not bad. The skin is a bit thicker then Dian Dai Feng, but the meat and the soup in the bao is sweet and nice.if you had the buffer, Xiao Long Bao is free

1st time having lunch here for celebration. Fair value for hotpot ingredients. The various soup bases are very tasty. You have to make your own sauce for your food - beef chicken fish mutton pork mushrooms vegetables beancurd scallop etc. Most food are frozen or chilled types unless vegetables, pork liver, mushrooms, prawns which are fresh.We made reservation since our group is 8 unless you arrive before noon- typical lunchtime for office workers in China Square vicinity. Restaurant fully occupied quickly for lunch. Overall the buffet allows you to eat till you contended

Good food, bad English. We struggled through the ordering process, hindered by serving staff with almost no English, but helped by kind locals on the adjacent table. We each chose a different soup base and picked from a large selection of extras to cook in it: meats, seafood, noodles, mushrooms, tofu etc.Our pots of soup were topped up as needed and the extras kept coming throughout the meal. The base price was S$23 per person, with a few dollars extra depending which soup we chose and for water (and $2 for towels?!). There's a warning on the menu that food ordered but not eaten will attract a charge - so don't over-order. Service was excellent - very fast, attentive and friendly. Food was all delicious. Don't chose the hot spicy soup unless you really like hot food. I'm pretty good with chilli but I wish I had ordered the mild spicy instead.

To get there, nearest train station is at Telok Ayer (Down Town Line - Blue Colour). Short cut is to take the exit towards PWC Building and cut across Amoy Hotel and into Far East Square. It is just located opposite of Yakun at China Street. Went on a weekday lunch and enjoyed it. Service is great, staffs were very attentive and polite. Ingredients of the food from veg to meat were all very fresh. Dare to say their garnishes like spring onions and chinese parsely also seems like it is freshly cut. Experience overall is a 5 star and will definitely go back again. Price of lunch depends on what you order. I paid mine for about SGD 21.00 as I took a more premium soup.

Price may be bit steep compared to the offering of the ingredients and variety. I don't think will visit the 2nd time as the place is too cramp and quite horrendous services.

Good ambient and location for gathering, either you choose single set or share steamboat... Food are nicely present and fresh as well

Dinner there was great. Ingredients were fresh and service attentive and prompt.
Reservations required as it is very popular especially during weekends.

I am a steamboat freak and I always will look for best steamboat to try. I found this from my ex colleague and it was a good try. Clean environment, good service staff and items were fresh.

We had the la carte steamboat lunch buffet with dual soup base â€“ mala and nourishing chicken soup, and it was great. Mala soup was spicy but very tasty. Ingredients were fresh and served fast. Thereâ€™s also free flow of xiao long bao for ordering at no extra charge. Service was good. Price is ok in my opinion. I've eaten some other steamboat buffets which are similar but more expensive. Make reservation in advance as place is usually packed

This place would not earn me a 2nd visit any time soon as the quality is only passable with so many choices of steamboat in the market now.For those who likes a free flow of meats for steamboat this is well worth considering but what put this place down would be the extremely high charges for drinks at $3.90 for a small glass of prune juice and worst $0.50 for a wet towel....I think there is better way to earn money than this.However what is worth mentioning is that the quality of service is high despite being a hectic weekend

4 of us ate 4 different dinner steamboat sets with 2 soup bases - Spicy Mala and Regular nourishing soup (no extra charge). We had 2 soft drinks and 2 bottles of beer and total bill works out to about $100. If you guys can eat, i would suggest going for the a la carte buffet for more value for money as the food options are quite fresh and it could really work up your appetite. Dinner buffet costs about $23.90++ which is on the cheaper end considering air-conditioned steamboat options. There were some cooked food for desserts as well, not the best but not bad since they are free

Made a complete mess of the meal. The early part was almost raw, the middle was good and the end was mush.The spicy broth was excellent. The service varied between friendly to surly and back to friendly. Certainly would like to try this again. The ranking doesn't reflect the restaurant more my ineptitude at attempting to cook here. The value is amazing under Â£10 for a very filling lunch

It was time for lunch with the colleagues, headed for Guo Fu Steampot Restaurant, the perfect choice for a rainy afternoon as such. Besides buffet meals, this place offers personal hotpot set meals as well, ranging from SGD$13.90 to SGD$17.90 per set, depending on personal preference.Four of them had the Pork Set (SGS$13.90), served with fresh-looking, pinkish slices of pork and arranged neatly on a tray with potato slices, radish slices, fishballs, egg, and other vegetables etc. One may also choose rice or noodles as staples for the set.I had the Special Beef Set (SGD$17.90), since they are well known for having the best fatty beef in town. The beef was thinly-sliced and extremely succulent, sweet with freshness. The potato and radish chips were cut thinly as well; as were the rest of the crisp and fresh vegetables.One of them had the Spicy soup base (ma la), with numbing hotness. The degree of spiciness was high, and I choked at it at first sip, hence I suggest taking it slow when selecting this soup base.As for me, I had the Kimchi soup base. Disappointingly this soup was rather diluted; while aromatic with kimchi's flavour, it was rather mild in taste. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed it.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/05/lunch-at-guo-hu-hotpot-steamboat-at.htm

Traditionell Steamboat aka Hot Pot. The staf were very friendly and showed us how to do and what to order. For like 25 SDollar you eat as much you want from 60 different ingridients like meat, seafood, veggies, nuddles and dessert. I can surely recommend this place. Enjoy
