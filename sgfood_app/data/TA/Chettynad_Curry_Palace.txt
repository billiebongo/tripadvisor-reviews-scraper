Located just down the street from Bunc@Radius hostel in Little India in Chinatown.We got a whole meal of chicken (with bones) with two sauces and some crispy bread - we selected the dish from the glass counter. It was pretty good but also a bit spicy. For the price (6S$) it was very good indeed. We managed to fill both my stomach and my girlfriends.You can get the vegetarian dishes for 5S$ and mutton for 7S$.Service was very good - and beers can be had at reasonable prices
