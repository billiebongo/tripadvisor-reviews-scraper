The whole place is very spacious with high ceiling. There is ample of space between table to table. Great place to have a quiet afternoon or evening to have a nosh and a cup of coffee or tea.
5
always enjoyed the skinny latte esp if its piping hot. was a regular at their Demsey outlet for years till they opened addn outlets
to me its one of the best place for Coffee other when i am in Australia

The perfect stop in between shopping on orchard road. I had one of the best burgers of my life and would love to go back. Didn't get a chance to buy any of the luxe groceries but hope to do so next time.
3
Surprisingly, the staff told us that we dont have a reservation. The fact that we showed the booking id but the staff couldn't find it in the record. Good thing staff managed to get us a good seat.
3
The food is not incredible, just okay. The waitress was a bit pushy because the last order was at 9.30pm and he wanted our order at 9.25pm.
4
Every time I am in Singapore, I always go here for a coffee and some snacks. What I like is after having my coffee and snack, I can buy gourmet stuff which are plenty in this restaurant. You will be surprised after how many have you got from just looking at their goods.

We were staying at the Mandarin and stumbled upon Jones the Grocer and what a great little find. We popped in late afternoon for a wine and some tapas. The service was outstanding and the tapas was lovely and fresh. We decided to go back the next day for lunch before we flew out. The waitress recognised us and sat us promptly. The meal was really delicious and filling and once again the service was outstanding

My sis and I had two breakfast sets, iced lattes and a bowl of truffle fries. I had the breakfast royale which was decent and my sis tried the one with the spanish eggs. Her complain for her breakfast was that it was a tad too sweet for her liking. Lattes were alright. Truffle fries was a disappointment, for it's price, you would expect that it was good, but no. Although the portion was huge, we could not taste any truffle oil in it.

great to catch up for breakfast lunch or even some simple foodfood was ok and ambience also ok.. service was greatin the mainstreet of orchard road enter the Mandarin Galeri and take a lift to 4th floor and walk along .. located almost at the corner..a basic cafe concept and great place fot chat along for business or pleasur

We came to Jones the Grocer expecting some delicious food, based on most of the reviews here, but were bitterly disappointed. When we ordered a beer, it was warm, not cold like it should be! And the service was really slow...we waited for 40 minutes and they still didn't give us our meals, although we repeatedly asked the waitresses if they were coming.After 5 more minutes, we got up and decided we couldn't wait any longer for the food, especially since we had a movie we needed to catch. Very disappointing, especially after all the good reviews we read..
2
I had a classic wagyu burger ($26++). For this price, I was expecting more. My burger was not hot and the coleslaw was warm! It was the first time in my life being served warm coleslaw.
4
We bought some drinks, cheese, olives etc. to have dinner in our hotel room at Jones in the mall adjacent to our hotel. What a nice way to spend a quiet evening when traveling
5
This place is great for little ones and the staff was very attentive to our needs. It is a pity they only serve the lunch menu after 12 noon though.
4
Service crew was attentive and food was great - ordered eggs royale and BBQ grilled chicken, both cooked well!
3
Ordered egg benedicts with the extras. Tasted fine but nothing special. The same for its cappuccino & pancake. Great atmosphere to catch up with old friends.
5
This was the best coffee we had during our entire trip to Asia. The atmosphere her is quite cool and trendy.I had a superfood salad which was delicious while husband had a sandwich which he thoroughly enjoyed.All in all I would definitely recommend it for the coffee alone
4
Had brunch with a bunch of girl friends here. Relatively quiet for a Saturday morning but nice because it wasn't noisy. Service was prompt although the manager looked a bit grumpy and took a while to warm up. Food and drinks were served promptly as well. Hotcakes looked charred, tasted and had texture more like french toast than fluffy hotcakes. Wish there were a few more slices of banana for the hotcakes. Friends had Benedict Breakfast and Eggs Royale which were yummy except for the fact that the housemade sourdough was a tad too tough which was difficult to cut through even with a knife. Tea pots (good for abt 2 small cups) not refillable by staff but they did give us a small jug of hot water which we cld fill ourselves. Wouldn't mind coming back for ambience but may try other items

Visited on a Saturday afternoon for lunch - the placed was crowded but we managed to get a table still.Service was busy and food took a while to came, but it came all together at once. We ordered the below items:- Toast (a plate of 2 slices of muffins and 2 slices of baguette) ($9.50)- Mushroom Risotto ($23.00)- Fish & Chips ($26.00)- Long Black ($5.00)The toast was toasted hot and crispy and came with a side of jam and butter, though there was nothing really special about it.The mushroom risotto was well-done, creamy and tasty. The rice grains however tasted slightly undercooked.The Fish and chips - well the chips were hot and crispy, right, but the fish came a little bit black (over-fried?). Nevertheless it was crispy and the fish meat was just right.The long black was OK - nothing bad or good about it either. Though like another reviewer mentioned before me, the cups had handles that were ridiculously tiny! You either had to hold the cup by the sides (ouch! hot!) or you had to use your fingers to pinch the handles tightly in order to lift the cup up to drink.All in all with the addition of a 10% service charge and 7% service charge, the bill came to a whopping $75.32, (nevermind the fact that the simple meal did not even feel like that amount of money...)Service was dodgy at best and water glasses were not filled promptly until I indicated so to the servers. The seating that we were allocated to (a 2-man table beside the pillar) was cramped as well, and seats would knock into the adjacent table if all seats were occupied by restaurant patrons.There is indeed a lot of improvement for Jones the Grocer here at Mandarin Gallery
4
We had our lunch here before leaving Singapore to Vietnam. This is an Australian restaurant and they serve great food and excellent coffee! Had a Wagyu burger and a Latte. Both were great and the latte was just fantastic!! Will be back again when I have a chanc
3
Stopped in here for some Eggs Benedict and a Tea.The Hollandaise Sauce on the eggs was rationed with a teaspoon and I had to ask for extra sauce. Eggs Benedict is ALL about the Hollandaise. What I got baurely covered a single egg. Service great. But the cups for the tea and coffee! Who chooses these things? don't they try them out? The handles are so tiny you can;t get your finger through it to hold the cup properly! Always 2 hands needed. May sound trivial, but it is attention to small detail like this that highlights the difference between good and great. I have been in F&B 30 years - I know! Design over practicality never succeeds. For $33 for aa breakfast, I expect not to have to ask for extra sauce and to get a cup that works.Otherwise, fine :-

Amazing Experience , gourmet meals with a hint of fabulosity
A definite everyday destination. I enjoy that the food is healthy as well as trendy
4
Really good food.Amazing french fries need a mention.Delicious chicken pasta.A reasonable wine list too!
4
Great food. Also have lots of unique and special food items to buy home. E.g. Sauces, etc. Worthwhile place for weekend brunch
4
Low key place with good quality food. Not much of variety. Limited soft drinks available. Service was good.
5
Salad and coleslaw that went with my pulled pork sandwich were amazing. Maybe cos coleslaw in SG usually tends to come out of a pre-mix of some sort, they all taste the same. This was a good meal and everything tasted fresh. Good stuff.
2
Too expensive for the quality of food. My Aussie burger was supposed to have an overeasy egg but the egg yolk was already broken when it was served!
4
had an enjoyable late afternoon antipasto plate plus delicious bread and cheeses and a good glass of wine
3
quite ok, the breads were quite nice, although i've noticed that the quality has come down over the years.
3
Easily accessible via the Orchard and Somerset MRT stations.Average price per person SGD35Three of us, each had a main for brunch (Eggs Benedict type) and 2 coffees each.Perhaps I've lived/worked outside of Singapore for over 5 years now so my taste buds have changed but I didn't find their food as tasty as before (subjective I guess). Used to love heading out to their original outlet at Dempsey Road years ago where the ambience and quality of food there/then was much better.At this outlet: Service staff, polite. Quality-wise, decent. Taste-wise, fair. Price-wise, comparable with similar places. But I'd probably give it a miss unless I'm in the vicinity or run out of places to eat.Funny thing is that the restaurant itself will not take reservations for the weekends (I called twice but was rejected). However, we managed to book a table for Saturday via a reservation app called, Chope. Strange...Adeline LeeDined with 2 other friends for brunchSaturday, 17 October 201

Was having a birthday celebration and we brought our own cake and we were required to pay $25 for cake surcharge. Told them we understand that they are inly selling slices cake and not a whole cake hence we brought our own cake. But they refused to understand and said we should reserve for a birthday cake when we reserve table. Totally a bad and embarrassing experience
5
They serve the best red velvet cake!!!
I keep going back for more!! I always miss their breakfast timing tho :-( will try to go earlier next time!
4
Ordered wagyu burger. Was good. Flat white was awesome. Will return and hopefully service staff is more friendly and quick next time.
5
If you enjoy French Italian Spanish or any great cheeses, the cheese room at Dempsey is a must. For special occasions as it is all imported and not cheap but wow so good.
5
Stayed at Mandarin Orchard recently November 2014 had breakfast and had dinner steak etc both excellent staff very friendly and pleasant will definitely return

were out with the kids struggling to find a taxi or get around on a busy shopping day. we have eaten at Jones the grocer in other countries. it was, as ever, OK. fine, decent, safe lunch. pricey but not ridiculously so. all ate and were satisfie

Went to Jones @ Mandarin for dessert two nights ago and left horrified. Service is average and the place was relatively quiet on a Monday night.A friend and I ordered a Sticky Date Pudding and Black Forest cake. The Sticky Date Pudding is pretty good but not the Black Forest cake. I wouldn't have expected a stale or moudly cake from Jones to be honest. When the cake arrived, I saw a small white spot at one corner - but had thought it was just some frosting sugar from the serving utensils. The cake tasted sourish and I had assumed it was intended or simply from the berries that was in the cake. When I was almost done with the cake (there were 2-3 forks left), i tipped the cake over and saw mould all over the bottom of the cake! Horrified, we called the staff over and she immediately said she will give us a refund for the cake and took it away (before I thought of taking a picture of it). The staff acted like nothing happened and did not even offer any explanantion!This led to me having the runs the whole night and day after. Absolutely horrifying/terrible and intolerable for a restaurant/cafe to be serving cake that has not only mould but turned bad. I was told that the Black Forest cake is one of their most popular - so how did this happen??Please avoid going there or at least check your cakes over before sinking the fork in them
3
This is a cool place to hang out, but I as pretty disappointed by the coffee. I had a single shot latte and it wasn't the artisan type of coffee expected by a place like this. My friend had one of the juices and it was extremely sour. They were also out of a lot of things and had Christmas cookies on sale, which I thought was a bit strange (40%) off. The ambiance is nice and if you need a place to just sit that is cool then check it out. Free wifi too. I am not sure how the food is.

I had a great brunch at Jones the Grocer and the coffee was exceptional. Their flat white coffee was one of the best that I've had in Singapore. I noticed that they were a little under staffed (only two wait staff serving the whole restaurant) but they seemed to manage and we didn't have to wait too long to order and have our food and drinks served. I was excited to find a place serving great coffee within close proximity to where we live and looked forward to returning often.I came back the next day at around the same time. This time they had three wait staff serving, however it took a lot longer for someone to approach us and take our order. We ordered two coffees and some pastries. The pastries arrived within ten minutes however we waited over half hour for our coffees. The table next to us had also ordered a coffee directly after us with the same wait staff and received his before we did. When this happened we asked if it would take much longer - they mentioned that because they are extremely busy, the orders are queued and that we would still have to wait for some time before they get to our order. We ended up cancelling and asking for the bill.They can have the best coffee around but I'm not going to wait over half hour for it. They should look into having more wait staff and being more organised with prioritising orders
5
I am not entirely sure why it is called Jones the Grocer since really this is an upmarket Australian/NZ style café with some products also for sale. Anyhow, that one minor query aside, the food here is probably the best café food you will find in Singapore.They do all the usual dishes, presented very nicely, recommend the cold cuts and cheese platter as well as the coffee.The service is attentive, friendly and the location is good. In short, it's good value for money, great quality food, and while I never met anyone called Smith or Jones, it was still very very good.Can't comment on the bar side of things, but recognised some fairly boutique type beers and no doubt this would be a great place for a late holiday lunch or dinner also
4
Yummy food. Excellent coffee. Terrific choice of wine and beer (although some of our preferences were out of stock). Obliging waitress sorted out a top value NZ South Island Pinot noir by the glass to compliment the best gruyere I've tasted outside Switzerland. Current gruyere promotion in store.
4
Took a chance because my kids weren't up for Asian food and all of our food came out great. We really enjoyed the cheese tray. My only complaint is I think it's priced a little on the high side.
4
Usually have coffee here but popped in for a dinner today. Went for the scotch steak, Australian for ribeye. It was ok, and for just $30 or so, decent value and go in with low expectations. The highlight is usually the cheese/meat platters for me. Instead of the pre-determined platters found on the menu, I usually pay a little more and pick the specific cheeses and meats that I want for the platter. Further, for a fixed price, you can pick the more expensive cheeses and meats, and not just leave it to the menu. And the cheeses and meats are always a generous portionNot sure if it was closing time, but our waters were not always filled up. But overall, service was o

I came here for brunch twice during my recent stay in Singapore. This place has good ambiance, service, with reasonably priced and good breakfast fare. Though when I say reasonable, I mean in terms of overseas travellers, not necessarily compared to other Singaporean breakfast fare (like Toast Box or hawker centre offerings, which are about half or even a third of the price)I had the hotcakes and another dish I can't recall while I was here. What I did remember was that the service size was a bit small for my taste. But you should probably take that with a grain of salt - I'm an Australian that's been living in London for the last few years, so my notion of serving size is probably out of sync with Singapore. Their tea selection was quite good
3
Good thing about this one is the location. You can stay away from the rest of shopping crowd. Not a type of coffee I expected but with reasonable price at that location, it was a good choice. Better than Starbucks. Will I visit again? Yes, I loved their cake selections.
4
We have our second morning breakfast here, the breakfast here are price wise is cheaper than the wild honey, quality is also as good as wild honey, but loosing out on the atmosphere. Our bill total up here is 60SGD for two person and I ordered another 2 more coffee while waiting
4
If we are in this area, this is our venue for breakfast. Selection was small but with good quality. We enjoyed breakfast here each and every time. Service was ok and not a bad service. The overall atmosphere is relax and a good place to meet friend or get together
4
What I like about Jones the Grocer is their ability to deliver on brand promise. They aim to be upscale western with a touch of deli class, and they deliver. The reviews on this page are mixed but our family lunch outing was terrific. I was in the mood for a gourmet burger but reserved since the past three so-called gourmet burgers i tried at other places turned out to be fluffed up Burger King Whoppers. But JTG nailed this Wagyu Burger big time - the meat was tender but well cooked, and just the right mix of condiments, and a very healthy portion, too. I'm still full four/five hours later. I will go back just for this burger. My daughter had a burger kids meal - same reviews. My wife had a vegetable salad of some type which she enjoyed. The service was great. Very courteous, very prompt. My only side concerns - iced tea... not quite the fresh black brew I enjoy, and very cloudy; and the fries seemed like the type from the bottom of the pile. If it wasn't for those two things, I would have given this five stars. Really great meal today - thanks JTG
1
Went for lunch late Saturday afternoon. Waited 10 mins for a server (and had to go and find him) only to be told they had run out of fish and chips and also spaghetti bolognaise so there was almost no kids food. Left at that point. Something wrong with this plac

I only recently discovered this place by chance. Finding a place with a nice atmosphere for breakfast is rather tough. My first time, I ordered their Bacon and eggs. It was really good. But I must say that the service isn't as attentive as it should be. I've been there 3 times in a week as I think the lack of service could just be an off day, but I was wrong. I see it as management not knowing how to manage the staffing and severely under-trained. Try their Big breakfast. It's a full english breakfast as it should be. Eggs, bacon, sausage, tomatoes, mushroom, toast and baked beans, plus sautÃ©ed spinach. Yummy. I have to disagree with the previous reviewer (glusa408) about the lady with red hair. She's one of the servers that are most attentive and observant. Being given a bill before you're finish isn't necessarily an indication they are trying to get rid of you. It only helps in expediting speed in case you are ready to leave. And if you want to order more, then just order. No harm no foul. I wish these servers wear name tags so that we know who's who instead of referring to this lady as the red haired lady. Keep up the good work, red hair lady
4
I came in to this restaurant just a few days ago. They seemed to have done magic to the place. It breathes a fresh and vibrant atmosphere as compared to when i came in last year. The service staffs were excellent and very eager to please. They were very prompt. In fact a little too prompt. I was there with a friend to chat over coffee. We were very engrossed in our conversation when a red haired lady came over with the bill! A BILL! when we are not even done with our coffee! We did not ask for any bill as yet?! Was she trying to chase us out of the place! It was totally unacceptable. I spoke to a gentleman who seemed to be the manager in charge. He is truly a star. He was very quick to apologise and made us feel very comfortable again.  The same gentleman greeted me at the door when i came over the next day for coffee. He even remembered what i previously had! That was a pleasant surprise. I felt right at home straightaway. This time no one bothered me with a bill, and i could take as long as i want to enjoy the new ambience while i have my coffee. Please convey my sincerest thanks to that gentleman. I do not have his name but he is the one with the local Singapore accent! If you happen to be around the area, drop by the place! But keep a distance from the red-haired lady. She will have you at the exit way earlier than you want to
4
Was there for brunch.Delicious Benedict's eggs on a muffin.Son-in-law and daughter had a beef burger which they said was excellent.Located in a mall so can combine shopping with meals.
3
Ordered a soup and main course and they came at the same time. OK, the main course was a cold dish (which I didn't expect it to be) but this is not the way. Service a bit unprofessional and food very average.
4
It's a quiet place perfect for a sit down chat/catch up. We came because we miss European food --the deli style. We came as a family. We asked for colouring tools for our lil one and the waiter came back with lots of cute colour pens and a few A4 papers. The service is Aussie style, they take their time to prepare food which allow you to chat. If you are expecting your order to come straight away, this is not the place for you. Heaps of choices on bread and deli food
4
Been here several times and the one at Ion Mall. The food options are great and love the brunch and weekend family atmosphere. Food came quick for me in all my experiences. The staff, well needs a bit of patience to get their attention. They are often doing their own stuff or running around busy. So during peak times, you could get frustrated. Pricing is a bit on the higher end for the food you get... But well it is in line with the pricing generally in Singapore. Oh, they sell some items such as jams and much more. Bought their jam before and it was really good. A bit too pricey though.
2
We had a great brunch two years ago and made a big mistake coming here to celebrate Father's Day ( Australian Father's day ). It took a long time for our food to arrive then; extra ten minutes for our daughter's French Toast- which was cold. Our Hot chocolate were no longer hot by the time they reached our table. The only attentive attendant ( the rest could not care less ) replaced mine with a warm one. To make matters worse, both my husband and I had diarrhea when we got home and we did not share our food. Fortunately our daughter did not get sick- cold French toast was better then. As I am writing right now- I still suffer upset stomach and there goes our Father's Day dinner.( If you are in the area, and looking for a good brunch- there is Wild Honey in the same building- don't take your chance here 
3
Simple but classy décor makes this place feel more like a proper café than the Dempsey location (ie. no communal table!) As long as you view it as a café/wine bar and not a restaurant, you won't be disappointed. Very good selections of teas, coffees, and wines; ditto for cheeses and salamis. The cooked food is ok-to-good, but nothing to rave about. It also takes a long time to come (on average 20 to 30 minutes, even when the place is not full); they must have a tiny kitchen or few kitchen staff. However, it's a plesant place to linger around over a coffee or a few glasses of wine. Occasionally, they come around and offer you bits of cheese. The clientèle is in the opposite proportion to the Singapore population - predominantly gweilos (sometimes with Asian wifes/girlfriends)
2
I was so disappointed with my dinner at Jones The Grocer. It used to be fabulous (weekends and breakfast is still good last time I went) but the dinner was appalling: specials were all gone by 5.50pm. The walnut and rocket salad consisted of warm, wilting rocket and sugary walnuts! Inedible. I had to ask 3 times for a spoon and a glass of water. Such a shame, this was my little haven on Orchard Road once..
5
I have never been to jones before but heard a lot about it. I visited the jones at mandarin gallery and fell in love. The great big cheese room, the lovey selection of unique groceries and the warm cafe feel. I had a benidit breakfast which was lovely and a flat white that was to die for. Service was really good as well. Got served by the manager who was very nice and told me about jones. Keep up the work. Will be seeing you again

Jones used to have my absolute favorite coffee in Singapore about 3 years ago. I have to say that the quality of their coffee has been patchy in recent times. The coffee is still decent but not something I would rave about anymore. The baked goods are still awesome, especially when you come in the afternoon, the yummy smell of freshly-baked chocolate cookies will seduce you. I love their croissants and recently tried their scone, which was fluffy and yummy. Even the French macarrons are quite nice, with a crunchy exterior and creamy, chewy innard, and it is surprisingly not too sweet!Jones has changed the menu in the last year or so, and they don't offer blended coffee drinks anymore, to my parents' disappointment. Nevertheless, it's still a nice place to chill over a glass (or a bottle) of wine with their impressive salumi and cheese selection. When it gets busy (say, during weekend brunch), the service can be a bit patchy, but otherwise, the servers are quite attentive and friendly. Overall, Jones is still a nice place to hang out in and chill when I'm in Singapore but it's not my ultimate coffee destination anymore
3
We visited the restaurant for dinner and this was our first visit. Jones the grocer has a reputation of great food and great retail product. We could not find fault with the food and the speed in which is delivered. We choose the Lamb Cutlet and Caesar Salad, both were cooked very well. What let down this experience was the placement of the retail product next to our table. This location is would have made it impossible to anyone to look at the Cordial product. We had to asked for the menu and water. We noted there were only two tables in the restaurant including ours. Jones the grocer has a fantastic concept with food you cant fault is juts missing any kind of service at all. Having said this review Jones the Grocer Dempsey Hill and Ion Orchard had been different experience with better service. So dont write off Jones the Grocer as an options if they work with service they will get it right
4
My friends and I was raving about this place, we love the breakfast menu quality . We were satisfied with the food but disappointed with the service. Slow and not friendly.
If its not for the food, we wont even return.
3
I've been Jones several times... the food quality was okay and i loved the most are the ice chocolate with ice cream and tiramisu with ice cream!
1
Great concept ... And initially in its opening years worked well.... Now has dropped its standards , poor service and average food!
3
In most places Jones would have been splendid but compared with most other places in Singapore I found it rather lacking in atmosphere and the staff not as friendly as elsewhere.
3
Lamington Cake and Chai Latte is good! Priced below $10. Nice cozy environment to chill, not very long que to wait either.
5
One of a few places in Singapore to get an excellent coffee (often enjoyed with a scone and jam). For an Australian, they bake the only decent bread I have come across in Singapore. I always buy a loaf or 2 for my daughter who lives there. I have also eaten a meal at their Dempsey restaurant, which was delicious - would recommend
4
Solid place for a nice brunch on the weekend.Although I personally try to avoid "in mall places", this one stands out for very solid brunch quality and very fresh ingredients, as well as great bread !Atmosphere is somewhat spoiled by being inside the mall without windows, but comfortable seating and very attentive staff makes up for it !All in all worth a try when on that end of orchard and considering breakfast/brunc
4
We wanted to try another breakfast place aside from Mandarin hotel's buffet breakfast. We ended up here. The servings are generous, it does not have McDonald's prices but hey its a sit-down restaurant. Service was very good a little delayed but its okay as it was a saturday and it was a full house. Anything on the menu seems nice. we had pancakes, sausages, bangers muffins the works. We were stuffed. Word to the wise, come in starving to enjoy the food
4
Whether in Sydney Australia or Singapore, Jones the Grocer chain is reliable. The bistro cafe style is informal relaxed dining with selective menu range. It also serves as a deli. The price range is a bit high compared to the Sydney chain. Service is polite and attentive. I enjoyed the angel hair linguine with crab meat and salmon with tiger prawns ...fresh and delicate flavours. Good coffee....which is part of a growing coffee society in Singapore
2
Order fried squid, chicken burger and ribs.Chicken burger- bun was very dry, no flavour in chicken.Service- slow. Took approx 30 min to serve. When place was only approx 20% occupied.we waited about 5min for our table to be set up after our food was served.Food portion is small. Price 24sgd onward for bar food, 28sgd for mains
4
Good food. ice location. Interesting food stuff and related items for sale. Also nice to just window shop and look at what other people buy or order.
5
If you are staying at the mandarin Orchard you must go to Jones Café/restaurant in the Orchard Mall, it's quaint, excellent breakfast, great coffee an amazing menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner and best of all, great prices and great service.
3
Revisited after over a year and was shocked that the place seems to be deteriorating. The interior (torn upholstery), service, food and beverage quality are clearly calling for help! The best thing I got was the cheese platter at choice.So sad because this used to be one of my favourite places
3
I always love to browse around Jones the Grocer, admiring its varied types of cheeses, gourmet jams, dairy products and what not. Trying the samples on display is another favourite of mine, which always results in a impulse buy. That is, until I came across Jones the Grocer at Mandarin Gallery.Since it is a branch from the one at Dempsey, I thought standards in food and service would be the same. But I was wrong.The Lemon Tart we ordered was beyond subpar - it was just a hardened piece of sugar. The crust was so hard I had to use a knife to cut a piece. I can hardly taste any lemon at all but it was all sugar and super sweet. Cannot believe that Epicure listed this place in their Top 10 for Lemon Tarts - thank god it was way before my time when I was there.We ordered a pot of Hojicha to share. When we asked for a refill of hot water, the waitress told us that if we refill the taste won't be as good as the first brew to which I gave her a puzzled look and said it's okay and I want to have a refill of hot water. And then she gave me a reply that annoyed me - "no sorry we don't do refills." Well, can't you just tell me that before you gave your first reply, to which I know now is ingenuine and fake.Well, I didn't believe her and decided to ask another male waiter the same question of having my pot refilled with hot water. His immediate response was "Yes m'am, do note that you are only allowed refill of 2 times - and instantly his response validated my suspicion that the waitress was telling me an untruth!Goodness.Tip: Lemon tart here not recommended. If you are here for mains, do go to the one at Dempsey, service and food much better

We just visited jones the grocer in Ion Singapore. We wanted a sandwich for our daughter and saw they had a Cheese and Tomato toastie on the kids menu that sounded perfect . So I ordered it. We were absolutely shocked when it arrived. The bread was the thickest sliced white loaf I have ever seen. Each slice of the toastie was at least as thick as three normal slices of bread. It gets worse. Inside this toastie - procured from a place that calls itself a deli - I found a slice of processed cheese, and some roughly cut tomatoes with some mustard and mayo. Oh, and normally a toastie implies the sandwich is TOASTED but in this case it was lightly griddled. I'm used the other stuff at JTG is good - looks like a nice place. But don't bother going with children - they clearly have no clue how to cater for them or for that matter make a simple toastie that my 2 year old daughter could have made better herself. Very disappointing.
5
Wow......I think it is the best I have ever tasted. If only I could buy a tray to take home.The coffee is good.I visited here twice while in Singapore for 4 days. Once for lunch and had the salt and pepper squid......very tasty. The next for brunch and had the GF corn fritters......delicious! A little pricey but delicious!
3
I had the wiener schnitzel with frites - delicious. The service, however, was awful. My water was never refilled. My order was taken 10 minutes after I was seated. I finally asked for the check after pushing my plate away and waiting 15 minutes. Very glad I brought a book

OK, where do I begin...?We've been going to Jones Cafe at Dempsey for a number of years. And we also frequent the branch at the Mandarin Gallery on occasion.The Cappuccino's are good, and the food - when it (finally) comes - is decent. It is borderline decent "value for money", but if there is anything that the venues do not know how to do, is run the service side of the restaurant.It is so disorganized and slow, I am surprised that there aren't more complaints on here. Great potential, but management needs to change

Jones the Grocer at Mandarin Gallery has a beautifully open layout with pastries on one side and cheeses on the other side so that you can shop for food delicacies while you are waiting for your order to arrive. That's a joy not many restaurants can offer. Here are the advantages:They provide free wi-fiFood is good simple fareGourmet mart with unusual foods for sale, great displayI had a croissant that was delicious. i recommend the croissantsMy poached eggs and sourdough toast were very good but not unusualMy wifeâ€™s BLT sandwich looked nice but she said it was not specialWe feel Jones the Grocer provides a very good eating/shopping experience, especially for breakfast for those staying at hotels nearby. For more up-market breakfasts and prices we would go to Wild Honey, also in the Mandarin gallery, but they can't match the gourmet food shopping that you enjoy at Jones the Grocer

Visited this outlet 4 times over 3 years.There has been NO improvement in the poor service.Staff are very slow in clearing table, slow to sit diners, slow to return to take orders, just SLOW SLOW SLOW in everything. Together with this slowness is their inattention. My friends and I share the same impression on this place.Some dishes are good, many mediocre and on a few occasions downright under-cooked including the pasta. So, it is a hit-and-miss affair with the food.But the BAD SERVICE is consistent.The only difference which is blatantly obvious over the 3 years is the lack of customers dining.That really SAYS IT ALL about how this outlet is failing

We enjoyed a very welcome breat from the crowds and heat in this trendy cafe. The food and coffee were well worth the visit.

This is a nice place for great coffee and pastry. I think the cheesecake is exceptional. The retail display is neat and it somehow makes you want to bring home something before you walk out of the restaurant.

Jones is a nice place with nice food, nothing standout, and priced at a premium to other bistro outlets. It is average for the price. Food portions leave you still hungry, service is amazingly slow. It is saved somewhat by the coffee, whicis very good.

Excellent proper strength coffee, not the usual Singapore dishwater . Food is so so and the cheeses disappointed.

We visited Jones the Grocer in the Mandarin Gallery while we were staying at the Mandarin Orchard. I was intending to pick up some snacks for late night and was delighted by a well thought out selection of gourmet treats. Far from a convenience store I was expecting I discovered a true food emporium and delighted in their selection of macarons in delightful flavors along with creative selections of sweets and savories.Its refreshing to see an establishment true to form and vision of excellence, freshness and creativity!Go for a look - leave with an armful

Went to Jones at Mandarin Gallery for breakfast. To eat I had Spanish eggs (or something like that, I forgot the name): Sunny side up eggs on a tomato sauce and spinach which was just ok taste-wise. Also I had their Granola, and pain au chocolat. The pain was good, the granola tasted a bit rancid. For drinks I had a fresh mixed juice which was ok and a cappuccino that tasted very good. All in all Jones is a nice bistro, centrally located with good coffee and so far ok food. I might give it another try next time in Singapore

I am in love with this place!The range of coffee is excellent and so are the sandwiches which are available only on weekdays.They also have this excellent variety of cheese displayed in very tall fridges from all over the world.But the main reason I am always here is because of the excellent service. This is not easily available in Singapore as we know. The manager Rashmi, has never fail to welcome me with warm smile and great attitude. She has great attention to details and is always full of energy. One of the very few passionate people I have met that take such pride in what they do

So casual, delicious, friendly.... In the morning you can enjoy eggs in different style accompanied with fresh bread and pastries. I have not been there for lunch but visited for dinner. We took a bottle of New Zealand or Ausrtralian wine with nice hot plates. You can not to take second course. Just cheese or antipasti. So cute! Staff is so friendly and open! Like this place so much

This is my third time to jones. First time here with my friends, we liked the latte and strawberry very much. Second time I took away a large latte but it didnt taste anything close to what i had previously. This time the latte tasted awful :( the staff greeted us with NO smile. I am dispoointed with the service and drinks and will not visit again
