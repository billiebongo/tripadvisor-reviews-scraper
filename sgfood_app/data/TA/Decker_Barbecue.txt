Relaxed Saturday brunch ... good food, great service ... missed out on the burnt ends which were not ready. Would have been better if the meats were served warmer
5
Went to celebrate a birthday and the staff were very accommodating in providing a nice little candle on top of their dessert. That aside, food was yummilicious. Got to try the corn bread and the meats so tender! Place was rowdy and happening after 7pm.

Family of 4 we decided to try Deckers as the reveiws all seemed good.We asked for 2 portions of ribs and 2 portions of pulled pork and were given a share plate with 4 ribs, a splodge of pulled pork with some fries and slices of bread. The ribs were not cooked and the pulled pork was a mushy mess that tasted only of pepper. On the board behind the counter the meats are advertised at $7 - $9 for 100g yet somehow the share plate + glass of wine + root beer was $98!!! Don't go unless you enjoy being ripped off and being served inedible food.

Any Texan knows brisket and burnt ends. Well this is definitely the place to get it and a bottle of Shiner (yes Shiner!!). Stopped by with some friends becuase we saw Shiner in the cooler. Looked at my wife, could it be?? Real Texas BBQ??? Let's just say no disappointments. I had the sliced brisket, burnt ends and pulled pork. Wife had the same and we also ordered brisket beans, corn bread and potato salad. The brisket was awesome, it had a great smoke ring, was juicy and very tender. The burnt ends were killer!! The sauce they used was not to sweet and had a great taste. The pulled pork reminded me of a puerto rican pig rub, a little touch of sweetness and spiciness. I can't say enough about the corn bread, it was moist and buttery. The brisket beans could almost be a meal in of themselves, they had big chunks of brisket in the beans.We left Texas about 4 years ago ago and haven't found any brisket anywhere close home in the US much less anywhere else. This was soooo sooo good! I was talking to We(?) and she was telling me they flew to Dallas to buy the smoker. She could tell I was so excited she took me and my Australian friend to see the smoker. She also invited us to come by early in the morning if we wanted to see them prepping (4am). Decker more than exceeded my expectations and our Australian, German and East Coast US friends are now fans of Texas BBQ. BTW, you get a piece of white bread with your brisket. So legit!!!

Excellent grilled meats with proper beer selection. Ate here twice an the a la carte was better than the brunch selection. The pulled pork was a personal favourite and the spare ribs better than anticipated from other reviews. Their recommended 300g of meat was more than enough - 200g suffices for me especially if also choosing a side order.
4
We visited for lunch on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy at all. The outdoor seating area was covered. My kids and I shared a three-meat platter with three sides and it was more than enough for all of us. The cost was $70 which seemed reasonable for the amount and the quality. We loved the unlimited brewed ice tea (choice of sweetened or unsweetened) Food, service, atmosphere were all very pleasant. We will definitely be back
5
We went and picked up the food to take it away ... asked the guy what he advised for the amount of ppl there were, and taking into account likes and dislikes. he was awesome. The food was amazing.... so hit the spot. We got all the sides, everyone had a different favourite....mine was the cornbread. The meat!!!! Brisket, ribs and pulled pork!!!! so recommend this place
5
Simply love this place! I could eat here everyday if I could. While it's quite simple in it's design and decor, who cares? They have a great selection of pulled pork and briskets and other godly foods. The pulled pork sandwich, however, is the highlight. They also have some good beer bottles and some interesting bottled cocktails. And the host? Sha is the best
4
We had the eggs benedict with brisket.The meat was delicious, it could have been a little warmer as the food was only luke warm.But we didn't care as it was so tasty.The side of mac and cheese was delicious. Small helping but very rich and cheesy ...and filling.My one tip for the restaurant would be to change the brown paper lining you serve the food on.In the US we has BBQ meats served on chequered red and white paper.Its mch more appealing to the eye

I found myself in Singapore and searched BBQ Singapore on Trip Advisor and Decker BBQ came up as a top ranked American style BBQ in Singapore. It deserves that ranking, it's good. As with a lot of restaurants in Singapore the actual tables are not really inside, there is no door that you use to enter, the tables and chairs are located outside under a covered area, perfectly normal for Singapore. The day I visited it was not that humid and there was a nice breeze. They use lichy and almond wood in their Pit, and said they cook everyday. Smoker is a large vertical square offset. Was not fired up when I was there. Brisket, nice texture, subtle smoke (could be a bit smokier but was not dry, me piece was from the flat), pulled pork good, apple vinegar flavours, short rib good, more pronounced smoke than the brisket or the pulled pork, tender, but quite a bit of pepper in the rub. They have a house BBQ sauce which was interesting, vinegar forward. I enjoyed the meat, the venue and the service was great. Well worth stopping by
5
Food is delicious and you going to get your arteries plugged in no time...ðŸ˜†
Nice open dining area and hope the traffic is less once the construction are over....
5
Had a great meals here! Very friendly team member here that suggested what we such order! Had the beef brisket, chopped beef, chicken, ribs and pull pork! Very well done!! Meat are very tender!!
4
Nice bbq. Would have preferred kale salad to be tastier / has more dressing and the sorry looking white bread replaced by something more homemade. Location is very bad because of construction going all around.
3
Feels overpriced for what is essentially a hawker stall for expats who have a hankering for a plate of meat. My 400g of ribs were good (not great but good) the side of mac and cheese ($6!) was inedible, some kind of pasta mess with a sandy textured paste and a weird bitter sauce to pollute whatever chance it had at redemption (I should have gone for the fries). All in that cost me $60 when factoring in two overpriced bottles of cider ($12 each) which I know is a typical price in Singapore but still irks. On the plus side they have a great tab system for allowing people to track and pay for their own costs which I wish more restaurants would embrace.
5
We had dinner at Decker Barbecue last night & it was awesome. The ribs & brisket were perfect-we know good barbecue since we're from Austin, Texas. We also had the beans and coleslaw and both were delicious. We love the food in Singapore but don't want to have it for every meal when we're here. If you need some down home cooking when in Singapore, go on over to Decker Barbecue-you won't be sorry! I think they are starting a delivery service soon as well. Their prices are reasonable for the size of the portions

An amazingly authentic Texas BBQ joint in Singapore who would believe! Decker is located at Robertson quay and has covered open air bench seating.They have a large smoker on site, imported from the states and serve up classic Texas bbq items of a very high quality.On our latest visit we tried the platter and got 3 meats : brisket, turkey and pulled pork along with sides of kale and coleslaw. There were 3 of us : 2 adults and a 12 year old and we found that the platter was just about enough for us. Probably could have eaten a bit more. All the food was really top notch, if I had to pick one item I would say the turkey was the best, it was just so juicy and delicious. There was also some nice Pilsner Urquell on tap.The price is quite expensive. The platter with 2 soft drinks and a Pilsner Urquell came to $100. But for the quality of food you are getting this is worth it.The staff are very helpful and friendly here and want to make your experience a good one. All in all we did have a great experience and will keep returning
5
Dinner with a business colleague brought us to Decker on a chance. It did not disappoint. We had the 3 meat dinner with pulled pork, ribs, and chop beef coupled with beans and fries. All were excellent, juicy and flavorful. As a temporarily displaced southerner this place is heaven in a sea of chili crab. All washed down with a cold Shiner Bock
5
Simple, no nonsense BBQ at its finest; definitely the best and most authentic US / Texas Smokehouse in Singapore!! The meat is quality and the general vibe of this place is great for social gatherings with friends. The staff are here really make an effort to engage and have good humour! They use proper conventional, wood burning smokers and the proof is in the meat itself... smoke, gelatinous beef that melts in your mouth every time! Everything is on point here and you should get a mix of everything (Ribs, Brisket, Pulled Pork)... Mac&Cheese / Corn Bread are clear winners from a side order perspective. They also have a great selection of US Beers that are not your 'everyday' selection. Deckers is a must try... it's soooooo Good!

We come from North Carolina where pork is the main BBQ meat. We were quite pleased with all the meats here - beef brisket, pulled pork, beef ribs, turkey, pork ribs, and chicken. All were surprisingly moist and tasty. The table-side sauce was just spicy enough. The cornbread was fairly authentic but more northern USA than southern. The sides - cole slaw, brisket beans, kale salad, potato salad, and mac & cheese were all pretty good as well. BBQ is the sort of item people argue about endlessly so don't be surprised by any naysayers. This is as close to southern USA BBQ as you will find in Southeast Asia. They offer bottomless drinks (only place in Singapore to do so) including fresh-brewed ice tea and a variety of craft beers. The apple crisp was a little light on apple but was good nonetheless and the banana pudding was just great. Worth the price
5
The brisket burnt ends were the best I ever had. The ribs meat was falling off the bone. The turkey was juicy and flavorful. The pulled pork melts in your mouth. Mac and cheese is served with hot sauce and it was perfect. My favorite side was brisket beans. Get it! All meats had a think smoke ring. While you order, you can see the smoker imported from Austin. I know Singapore is known for its Asian food, but you can't leave without eating here. This BBQ is better than many other places in Texas, highly recommended! Most authentic American dining experience that you can have in this area of the world hands down
5
Being an expat in Malaysia, this place tastes just like home! Everything is tasty and they have a great imported beer selection including shiner! I try to visit every time I'm in Singapore!
5
Small simple place hidden away in the back of Robertson Quay. It is a very simple place where you order your food at the counter. The bbq food is amazing and they have a huge selection on special beers to go with it
3
Visited and was expecting outstanding Texas BBQ. Was a little disappointed based on reviews. While this might be good by Singapore standards but I've had much better Texas BBQ stateside. I thought prices were a little high but given Singapores high cost this may not be justified. Beef brisket at over us$50 per pound would be high in most Texas BBQ's in the US but maybe this is reasonable in Singapore. Don't know, if you have a hankering for Texas BBQ in Singapore then this might be worth a visit but if visiting from the US better to wait for better BBQ stateside at a more reasonable price
5
One of my favourite places to eat at Robertson Quay... we go back time and time again! Friendly, quick service, the most amazing meat selection, and fantastic sides.It's very casual, so just rock up in your shorts and flip flops, grab a bench, order a tray full of delicious meat, a cold beer from the fridge and enjoy
5
This is a meat lovers paradise. Casual place , breezy , great staff.this place has great beers , BYO,good food.Near the river it has a great selection of BBQ meats , sides beers , wine etc.Ribs are amazing.If you come to Singapore , come here
5
As a huge BBQ fan I can tell you that deckers absolutely hits it out of the park. Great ribs, great brisket, and the macaroni and cheese with hot sauce is out of this world. Food is worth the price, though beers are definitely overpriced compared to some other establishments in the area we ate at. We hit Deckers twice in a five-day visit, adults and kids alike agreed, we loved it
5
For a true test of authenticity i actually brought a few Texans to feast at this location and boy were they surprised. They are normally very critical about the "American" food we serve here in Singapore but absolutely nothing but praise from them about this joint. Beef briskets and corn bread were the favourites but they had good things to say about everything else i ordered as well (and i ordered just about EVERYTHING on the menu). Good selection of beers and wines as well. Just as a warning. Go early. They have limited quantities of each item and they will sell out
5
 We are American expats in Malaysia and we eat at Deckers EVERY TIME we are Singapore. It is true Austin Texas BBQ. Order all the meats by the gram and they only make so much per day and once it is gone it is gone... get there early. And you can only get smoked turkey on the weekend (Devine!).
5
First of all the food is seriously delicious, definitely deserves 5 stars. I gave 3 stars because the service was not good starting with an item we ordered not arriving (in fairness we were not charged either) through impatience with us as first time customers asking for help with the menu items and just outirght unfriendly service. Bottom line, if you don't care about good service but want really good BBQ then this place is for you. The price is high for what this is but the other reviews have already called it out
5
It's outdoors, so you might have to deal with some heat, haze and rain, but Decker has come a long way in offering Texas BBQ in Singapore. Like all BBQ in SG, it's pricey and will set you back 100+ SGD for two people and beers.Mac n cheese is reaaaaaaaaaaaaal nice
5
Visited here with friends and it was some of the tastiest nest cooked meat I'd ever had ..highly recommend the brisket and the pulled pork
5
Grew up on US East Coast and Texas BBQ - have lived in Asia/Singapore for ~15 years. Best authentic BBQ I've had in Asia hands down. (and dog friendly;)
5
I love this place. The beer is great, the atmosphere cool but most of all...the food is unbelievable. All cut, weighed and served right in front of you. The ribs and pulled pork are my personal favourites, as well as the brisket BBQ beans...but really you can't go wrong whatever you order. If you have never had Texan BBQ before you will love it! If you have, it will remind you why you love it!

As a huge fan of authentic BBQ, Iâ€™ve heard many of the American states claiming to have the â€˜the bestâ€™ recipes. In Singapore, the options are more limited; luckily, we heard about this friendly, open-air, Texas-style restaurant from some American friends, and headed over with our Survival Chic Card to form our own opinion. I sent along with my fiance for a casual evening out, since sheâ€™s also a meat-lover, and we werenâ€™t disappointed. First, we found that the brisket is cooked the night before in a giant smoker; the taste is flawless, and the spare ribs fall off the bone and melt in your mouth. We paired those 2 with a â€˜party-in-your-mouthâ€™ Kale Salad and a perfect Brooklyn Lager, served in a hipster-chic bottle. The turkey and desserts - including banana pudding - also looked quite scrumptious, but we decided to save it for next time as we were completely satisfied (and in fact quite stuffed)... Since the atmosphere is chill and fun, our plan next time is to bring along a group so that we can order all the different meats to share and savor
4
We had a great dinner at Decker - bbq platter is delicious and the perfect size for couples. Service is very fast: our food came five mins after ordering (it wasn't busy when we were there). It is a little on the expensive side, but worth it for the quality of the meat.Unfortunately, the ambience is a little ruined by the load construction work taking place next door. Obviously not restaurant's fault, but we were from 6-7pm on a Thursday and it was quite loud. Overall, great place and good fun. Recommended
5
Have been to decker a couple of times. The experience is a fantastic, authentic Texan BBQ experience. From the self order at the counter, the aluminium trays and the backlit menu board behind the counter, this place feels real. They have some great dishes, I've tried brisket, pulled pork, bbq beans, kale and of course ribs. They have also partnered with Brewerkz a local Singapore micro brewery to get great draught beer (golden ale is the one) at their place. It's not the cheapest, but these guys have really put a lot of effort into making it feel really authentic. I have not yet seen hot links on the menu. If these have not yet been added, then they should be !!
5
Went for a quick bite after work, something small, but after taking my first bite of the ribs, I needed to have more! They tasted so, so good and it blew my mind! The ribs literally fell off the bone and the seasoning was to die for. It's what Singapore needs in terms of a phenomenal BBQ that reminds me of Texas eats. I don't even really like ribs, my boyfriend had ordered them, and then I ended up finishing them. They are THE BEST on the menu. The brisket and pulled pork are also to die for. We got the Mac and cheese as a side and it was extremely cheesy (the way we love it) with a bit of hot sauce on it! So yummy!!! The sauces are also very, very good! The challenge is the meat and seasoning are so good that you don't want to add more flavor but then the sauces are great too, so you're stuck in predicament ;) a good one!!! Expect to be very full after eating here. The service was also extremely kind and very helpful with our preferences :) will absolutely be back

I used to live in Austin, TX but recently moved back to Asia. Dreams of eating rudy's extra moist brisket have always come back to haunt me, but during this visit to Singapore a former longhorn told me about this BBQ place. The real deal. The best brisket I have had in a while. SO YUM !!! Had it twice in two days :
5
I've only tried one other "American style" barbecue restaurant in Singapore and based on the previous experience, my expectations were quite low. Thank goodness Decker Barbecue is here now with top notch, delicious barbecue. We had 100 grams each of the brisket, pulled pork, and Kansas City burnt ends. Note that burnt ends and turkey are only available on the weekends.The meat was well seasoned, tender, and cooked perfectly. We liked the potato salad and the corn bread was probably the best I've ever had. Thick, moist slabs of buttery goodness. My biggest regret is that I couldn't save room for dessert. Free flow sodas and iced tea is a nice touch for $6

Being a complete barbecue obsessive I have been slowly scouting around Singapore for a place that actually cooks this style of food in an authentic way. So far everything I have tried has been so far removed from real barbecue that these restaurants should not even be allowed to use that word on their menus. I have heard from reliable sources that these restaurants take all kinds of shortcuts to reduce the effort and time required to cook 'Real' barbecue. For example we all know that if you boil ribs, the terrorists win... And unfortunately there has been quite a lot of boiling, steaming and other non-traditional methods employed in these establishments...Enter Decker Barbecue to the scene. A very understated and honest to the bone proponent of Texas style barbecue. To be honest I and my group were not holding out too much hope of experiencing anything too different from the usual middle of the road quality we have seen. But I think can honestly say that this is the best reproduction of American style low and slow 'cue that I have eaten in over 2 years of living in Singapore and 10 in Asia. Unfortunately we arrived a little too late to try the spare ribs of which I am a particular fan but we did get two plates of the '3 Meat Selection with 2 Sides'The three meats we received were an exemplary beef brisket complete with a rich dark bark full of flavour, a surprisingly good portion of chopped beef and a mound of very tender pulled pork. All the meats were excellent, especially the brisket. The sides were good although played second fiddle to the main meats. Mac n' cheese, coleslaw and fries did not deviate too much from the norm. Add in a great selection of craft beers and a few Brewerkz choices on draft and you have all the requisite items for a great informal meal with friends or family. I had the pleasure of meeting Elliot (Decker), the owner of the restaurant at the end of our meal and it was clear from our talk that he is very serious about being a complete barbecue purist who refuses to take any shortcuts in producing some of the finest food around. He told us that his staff work pretty much around the clock smoking, wrapping and tending to the meats in their smokers. I can now finally say that we can actually eat REAL barbecue in Singapore!A word of warning... The meats here are so popular that you will need to arrive early to avoid missing your favourite cut. Also no bookings are taken and everyone is encouraged to just fight it out to grab some food and any chair you can to chow down
5
Had a wonderful meal here, the meat and sides were delicious. My only gripe was the carver guy recommended the fatty part of the beef which I didn't particularly enjoy, would have been much better without the fat. Still great overall though!
5
We've been four times in the last month since we found this place. It's soooo good. We've really been missing having good American BBQ. The meats are juicy and perfectly seasoned. The sides are great and just the right amount of spicy!
5
Although we didn't get to try the ribs, we loved the pulled pork, the turkey, and the brisket. The cornbread was awesome too. Great drink choices. Thanks for satisfying our Texas barbecue craving!!
5
Excellent BBQ meats. Really enjoyed the food and the great and friendly service.meet sells out so go early. I can really recommend this eatery.
5
We loved the food here. We ordered our food at the counter. The one cook I talked to was very nice to everyone and talkative. They weigh the food. We ordered 250 grams of ribs, 200 grams of pulled pork, corn bread, and potato salad. Our bill was about S$53. It was enough food for 2 of us and so delicious. It was a unique flavors and we loved it. We would definitely recommend this to others. I waited about 5 minutes in line, ordered, waited about 3-5 minutes and had the food. After we were done, we easily paid our bill fast and left. I loved the service which was closer to standards in the US. The place doesn't have a lot of tables but we went at 6:30pm and sat right down. They turn tables over quickly
5
I'm American. I have two smokers and I've been BBQing for a hobby for well over 20 years. I've lived in Singapore for over 9 years and finally there is a place to go if I want truly authentic American style BBQ without doing it myself.On a scale of 1 to 10 (best):Pulled Pork: 10+Brisket: 9Ribs: 9Burnt Ends: 9Sides: 8Beer Selection: 10The dude has a real smoker. A heavy-duty, purpose built, smoker. I've been to other BBQ joints in Singapore and I'm not convinced they have the right equipment. That said, there are a couple of other meat joints in Singapore worth visiting (ie Burnt Ends), most are more expensive. This is the best value for money in the segment
5
Decker BBQ is a little out of the way and you really need to look for it as it's at the back of Robertson Quay and not along the waterfront. It is an American Southern style of BBQ with many items being slow cooked items prepared in advance (eg pulled pork, ribs). So when they run out, they can't just throw another steak on the barbie for you! The sides are all delicious and authentic (so say my Texan friends!) We loved the kale salad and macaroni cheese with a kick! Lovely young, enthusiastic owner too! PS Not opened for lunch in the week
5
Tucked away against the new Hotel IC construction and Robertson Quayside corridor is Elliot Decker's Texas BBQ joint. Cold Shinerbock beer sits in the cooler and 10 feet away is the Mother of all Smokers in Singapore... This isn't your daddy's backyard BBQ. Skinny lean or fatty brisket, fall off the bone ribs, tangy pulled pork, solid sides (the fries, brisket beans, and cheddar-jalapeÃƒÂ±o corn bread were my choices), and local Brew Werkz on tap (meh!) make this Texas-style smokehouse well worth the visit. The food is just outstanding! All the meat, save the pork shoulder, is flown in from the US, and you can taste the quality. S'pores be aware, this is how it's done in Texas. There ain't no plates or purty napkins, just waxed butcher paper on a tray (if you're lucky to get one) and paper towels. Meat is weighed and sold by weight (like all Southern BBQ joints), AND if you show up at 21:30 for supper it'll be all gone! Cuz when the smokehouse sells the day's meats, they close up shop -- and that's how they do! They don't make more, so don't ask!Finally, the sauce is Texas style with a vinegar base, not sweet like in Georgia or 'Bama, and you don't put sauce on brisket -- ever! It ain't cheap, so bring your banker. If Franklin's could charge these prices in Austin, hooooooweeee! There'd be riots

We had the 3 meat platter for two with brisket, chopped beef, ribs and two sides. They were out of poultry on that day. Being from Texas and the food is legit. Although, it would have been nice to have more than one option for bbq sauce. The only down side is that it is very expensive in my opinion, even by Singapore standards.
5
This place has only been open around 4 months, so October 2015, but appears to have an enthusiastic following already. One of very few genuine smokehouse BBQ places in Singapore, the quality of food out of this oven, combined with the extrodinary attention to preparation, cooking times and delievry, has to be tasted to be believed. Seriously, have a chat with one of the 2 owners almost always on site, with a true smokehouse passion, and they'll fill you in on the entertaining details of the number of hours that went into each component of your meal.A fairly simple menu, with the emphasis on quality, and priced by the 100 gr, you decide your level of hunger, they decide how much pleasure you'll have dealing with it. The upside of the long slow cook is incredible flavours and super tender meat, but the downside is, once it's gone you have to wait for the next batch, which of course, may not be until tomorrow!I Should also mention an outstanding selection of not so common imported beers and IPAs - Shiner Bock! The side orders should not go un-celebrated, my kale salad, brisket beans and cornbread were all off the chart
