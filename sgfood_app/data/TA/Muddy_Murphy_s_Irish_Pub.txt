No Irish staff, but the Guinness is cold, and the Irish whiskey flows easy. Always some good tunes on, creating a lively atmospher

Has the feel and look of almost every pub that appears in Singapore these days, which is a shame as i preferred the feel of the original set up - before the re-opening at Orchard HotelHowever, the staff are still the hardworking and friendly lot - run off their feet a bit during the Eng v Wales Six Nations night as it took almost half an hour for our drinks to arriveStill, the pub I’m most likely to drink at when I’m in town

Amazing irish pub. Great atmosphere and variety of food and waiters come around to take your order. Everyone friendly. Its located in the bottom of the Orchard Hotel area just off Claymore road as well. Can't fault it. Great music to sing-a-long to if you want.

This pub is located a short 10 minute walk from Orchard MRT and just off Orchard Rd. Muddy Murphy's show all the major Sports on big screens and also host live bands. The menu is reasonably priced but if you want the Guinness Pie order early as they do run out. A pint of Guinness costs about $13 and go down very well in the humidity. Muddy Murphy's was busy on the occasions I visited with ex pats and would recommend a stop here for a bite to eat and a pint. Staff were attentative and I didn't have long to wait for another beer

Walked up to the pub from Newton’s food centre. It took about 20-30 minutes. Got there about 11pm. No tables available so shared seats with another few people around the outside keg table. Outside was for smokers so that was the first problem. Music was fairly loud, so had to shout at our friends. Drinks were pricey about S$14-20. Drinks nothing special. Bar food acceptable and priced according to the expensive expectations. When we left about 1230am it was still very busy. Interesting place to visit but just like any other Irish pub and expensive. However, everything in Singapore is expensive these days. No more bargains.

Staying at The orchard and looking for an eating outlet I stumbled on Muddy Murphy's. I am so glad I did. I ate over three days at different times. It became THE Eating place for me. Enjoyed the pints, the Sunday Roast, the steak and Fish & chips. Some say it is pricey but I found it worth it. Muddy met my nee my needs and satisfaction was the end result. I will be back the next time I am in Singapore

Have been coming here at the various incarnations since it opened. Bacon butty and a couple of pints - always delivers.

Been going for years, back to when Muddys had the underground pit. Its a bit awkward now (access wise) at the higher level however more than compensated by the excellent pub grub menu, the brilliantly friendly staff, an unexpectedly good Sunday afternoon blues band, and bloody sports - just enough screens and not everything is AFL! This is not a blokes pub but family friendly, I see families bringing in their toddlers and having a nice Sunday roast or an afternoon lunch when the pub isn't so busy. Past 6.30pm and the geezers come in swearing and talking football, oil & gas, and whatever .. but its a pub for goodness sake and I like it.Just be aware if you have youngsters - as with any pub - after 6pm there is a more adult character. Standout item on the menu is the all day Irish breakfast which is truly magnificent and can give the Sunday roast a run for its money. Well done Muddy's. Do I get a free pint for this review 
5
We always choose this place because of strategic location and great ambiance.Live band is great and the service was okay. Food was good too and normally their set lunch was inviting! It was always our choice for lunch and normally if we were lazy to travel, we would have our drinks after work. Great place to chill with friends

Guiness beer is great, I didn´t expect anything else..Service quality could be better though.Still recommended for having a drin
4
Nice little bar with football on, drinks reasonable priced and excellent food. Was some interesting clientele
3
It is a sports bar, respectively pub in Singapore - that says it all. Drinks are, like in most places, fairly pricey. Staff is friendly and has a good sense of humor
4
Loud noisy and boistrous bar with multiple TVs to catch up on major sports. There is outdoor seating too for people who like to have a drink and smoke
2
Rated well, but really disappointed. Soup was insipid, fries a mess. Service indifferent. Yes, there are beers. Also, right in the midst of one of Singapore's zones to find women of the night.
5
I like the new Muddy Murphys and think its as good as ever or even better. The staff are warm friendly and always make me feel welcome. The food is excellent and its the best place in Singapore to watch sport.My favourite visiting time is Sunday afternoon around 16:30 when the band strikes up and I relax and listen to a fantastic selection of well played tunes.Dont miss this place when you visit Singapore
4
This is a good Irish pub located inside the Orchard Hotel. Food and drinks are very good although the drinks are much more expensive than in the UK but this is what we found in other bars as well so it is not an isolated incident
5
Thoroughly enjoyable simple food well presented and served in a very friendly manner at reasonable prices - nothing to complain about whatsoever and plenty to enjoy
4
Called in yesterday for a cleansing ale or 2 in this very nice pub. Can't say enough about the staff especially Jay who helped us with every enquiry we had and was so pleasant, she is a credit to herself and her employer. Thanks Jay for all your helpAndrew & DianneAustralia Nov 1

I promised the lovely Jules and the not so lovely Declean (just kidding Declean) that I would write a review on Muddy Murphy's months ago and here it is.For anybody wanting genuine, high quality pub food you cannot do better then Muddy Murphy's. My favourite is the Shepard's Pie as Jules will testify however there is a full range of wholesome food. A friend of mine tried the Salmon and found it utterly delicious. Please read the menu carefully and make your choice of the wide selection, you will not be disappointed.Of course being an Irish Pub it would not be complete without Guinness which of course there is but I prefer the Kilkenny Irish Ale, it is a very nice drop. You will find a good selection of Beer's, Ciders and Wines.If you visit Muddy Murphy's once you will visit many times more, enjo

I was with friends so chose not to make a fuss.The staff are inattentive, distracted and just plain don't want to know you. It took 4 attempts to get an order in, which hurriedly written on a scrap of paper. So unprofessional.3 meals arrived. 2 to the wrong people. My meal, a bacon butte with salad and fries, was probably ready same time as my 2 friends, but sat, lost and forgotten, getting colder and colder until it was dumped in front of me, near inedible. I add to ask another 2 times for a glass of water with ice. I had to ask for HP Sauce, which was a part of the order, again, forgotten.If I was there alone I would've just walked out. If I saw another pair of Wait Staff or Bar Keeps chatting to each other again, ignoring raised hands from customers, I was gonna scream.A dismal performance all 'round

Well, it was a marathon finding Muddy Murphy`s Irish Pub in Orchard Road, Singapore. Wouldnt have found it had it not been for a chinese couple who were in the locality. I think they were from a religious organisation and spoke excellent English. They actually pointed out that the restaurant was inside a complex and being 74 years old, they even guided myself and wife across the road - it was quite busy with traffic. The inside of the restaurant was as you would imagine an Irish pub to be like. We went there because of their Fish and Chips. Not cod but something like it and well worth it. Nice tall glass of freshly squeezed orange juice to wash it all down with. If you get the chance, go ther

The move upstairs has not improved this place. Disappointing after previous visits over the years- maybe its me..
4
Nice staff. Well tended Guiness. Nothing not to like. Decent air conditioning. Nice floor coverings
5
visited here with a colleague, we were looking for something with good beer and no rice on the menu!!! nothing wrong at all with Asian cuisine but when you have been away for a long trip nice to get some Irish/English grub. good beer on tap do love a Guinness and other good Ales and the food on offer though not fancy was good quality and wholesome. just what was neededplenty going on with footy and rugby on the screens and a good atmosphere, glad we found this venue and in a good position at the top of Orchard Road
5
While spending time in Singapore the AFL Grand Final was on. Our hotel wasn't showing it and we found Muddy Murphys. Thanks to Declan and all of the staff, who were friendly, the meals were great and reasonably priced. It was an awesome find and will be back next time in Singapore
5
While staying at the Orchard Hotel, we ran accross this place and were delighted. The drink menue has plenty of import varieties and the food was great. Highly recommended.
5
Being away from home on the Australian sports calendar’s grandest day Declan and Justine made us feel at home. We booked by email and it was promptly responded to. What a great place for atmosphere, food and beverage. The staff were fantastic. The Charred Rosemary Gin and Tonic is to die for. And the beer is super cold. Thanks guys. Until next time.
5
Went for lunch to watch the afl grand final. Staff were very accommodating, friendly warm atmosphere, food was tasty and reasonably priced
5
We were searching for a reasonably priced dinner near our hotel and found Muddy Murphy's. What an experience. Declan O'Donnell is an Irish expat and offers true Irish hospitality. The food is great, with typical Pub atmosphere. The dinner was so enjoyable we returned there the next evening and had the bonus of a live band. This place is a must for any Australian wanting western food and Aussie wine. The service is great with roasts and Apple Crumble to meet my husbands standards
5
I have been visiting Muddy's since it first opened in 1996, in what is now a Cold Storage supermarket below its present premises. It really does feel like stepping into a 'real' Irish pub and for any expat in need of a 'taste of home' it certainly fits the bill. The food and beer are, as one would expect, the genuine article, with the main food menu offering something for everyone (including roast beef on a daily basis). The Beef and Guinness Pie is a house special and definitely recommended, as is the Irish Breakfast. The Sunday Roast is also a highlight - and great value for money!The Staff, though, are what make this feel like a home from home. Friendly, efficient and always ready to help with advice and recommendations, they are the real stars of Muddy's. With a good location, just off the northern end of Orchard Road, this is definitely the best Irish Pub in Singapore
4
This is what you would expect, an Irish pub in Singapore. No aires or graces, just a good old pub with beer, food and sports. Loads ot televisions to watch your favourite sports (I had a good choice of EPL, Australian Rugby League and Australia Rules Football, so pretty damn happy).Traditional Irish beer as well as a few other internationals and locals and good hearty meals at decent prices. For me it was the chicken burger and a half pint of Kilkenny. The grilled chicken was tasty enough and standard for pub food, salad on the side and some chips and the Kilkenny was Kilkenny, what more could you want.If you are in the area and need a sport and beer fix, this is your place to go.Service was great and the staff were friendly

Hidden GEM off Orchard Avenue near the Hilton Singapore. They have EXCELLENT Live Music. We were there for a classic rock band, and they were FANTASTIC! Clapton to CCR, they were GREAT! The atmosphere is FUN, but it is LOUD inside. The drawback outside is the cigar smoke, and the service is slower because they do not staff the outside to meet the crowd.We did not try the food, although the food selection seemed to be typical English/Irish fare. The beer selection is SOLID. I enjoyed a Guiness, and it was GOOD. I have had better Guiness at other Irish Pubs around the world where they take GREAT care and pride to make sure the beer is stored and served properly making the "Guiness Experience" delicious and cold. NOT AT ALL impressed with the Black and Tan pour that my friend had... NO separation AT ALL. They obviously do not know how to pour the PROPER Black and Tan.Overall, I rate it as FUN (because of the EXCELLENT live music) and GOOD. This is a SWING BY if NEARBY
5
Muddy Murphy's has moved back to its original location in Orchard (albeit at ground level) which is great. The service is always friendly and it's a great place to have a beer with your mates and enjoy the surroundings. Also a fantastic place to watch sports. Muddy's serves traditional pub food which is very tasty and reasonably priced.Recommend a Sunday afternoon at Muddy's when they normally have a band on. Only problem is that it's enjoyable so you stay longer and can lead to a hangover to start the week on Monday
5
we wanted someone with good food and reasonable priced near to our hotel,we found this one by chance so glad we did staff very friendly and food good,there was only once we felt a little rushed but it was getting a little late but food was still good and would go agai
5
And I was. I visited this pub at the same place but at the basement of the building between 90-93. So it has beem 25 years since then and I was longing to visit. So as soon as I am in Singapore again I went there with my wife and while I was searching a basement pub I found out that they moved to the surface of the earth. Still good, still very friendly staff and still good booze. Enjo

We had accommodation just round the corner and were after some good pub food. Muddy Murphy was good, they have Aussie Rules football on the big screens and have a live band at night. The food was honest pub food and reasonably priced. The alcohol is expensive but that's the same for all alcohol in Singapore.
4
I have been going to Muddy Murphy's since before their first move. Glad to see it is back in it's original location. Last visit spoiled by being told that I would get a table at 2100hrs for dinner, after the Thursday night quiz. Never heard from that waiter again. When I did find myself a table around 2120hrs, on asking for a menu, I was told that I could only choose from the bar snack menu. Making it known to the manager, she did offeer to see if the chef could still cook something for me. By that time I had gone off the idea of eating anything that night. Despite insisting that I wanted to pay for my drinks, the manager insisted that I accept the drinks with her compliments and apologies. 100%> for her kindness. I would have felt better paying. However, I will certainly continue to patronise Muddy Murphy's. Other than this isolated occasion, it has always been great. Thank you to Ms. Justine for her very kind gesture. Do please visit. It is a good pub and the staff are nice
4
Good food and had great atmosphere. Service is reasonably attentive. The evening I was there, a duo were playing in the corner and this appears to happen every night. Full service bar with lots of imported beers. Very popular late evening. Has a few high tables outside for those who can stand the heat.
4
The place to drink Guinness in Singapore. The menu has some really great Irish pub fare with some local flavor as well. Good place to meet up with friends as there is plenty of other entertainment nearby, specifically Orchard Towers so this location is great for people watching. Sports are well covered here too and the staff are fantastic. If you like a drink then you will soon be treated like a regular in no time at all. Love this plac
5
Great chill out place with colleagues and friends. The set lunch is value for money. Their dessert, Warm Chocolate Pudding and Sticky Toffee Pudding, are delicious. The staff are most helpful and friendly. This is also a great place for casual company function too
4
It has live soccer broadcast during match days, and you need to grab a seat early. Irish beer is nice here.
5
had sunday lunch here. really excellent food and great value. beats many much more expensive reataurants hands down. staff ate friendly and take great pride in serving good food,and drink to their customers. the pub is also cozy and relaxed
4
Nice cold beer, but expensive by Asian standards (OK, it is Singapore). Food was nothing special, although good serves. Band was very noisy, but at least it stops early in the evening.
4
We attended muddy murphys today to watch the All Blacks Vs. Lions game as a kiwi family on holiday in Singapore. We found the staff to be ultra efficient and friendly. Unfortunately the expat lions supporters who were also watching the game were not. We would recommend the pub to others but do pick your time to attend depending on what sporting event is on
5
Above average pub grub! Tasty, filling and good service. Friendly staff too! Pub quiz on Thursday is good for group of friends and Sunday live band is great too.

I was staying at the Hilton on Orchard Road (only a 5 minute walk) and was advised this was one of the best Irish Pubs in town. I've been to at least 5 in Singapore and will say this one is miles apart from those others-in a good way. I went first for Sunday Roast and enjoyed it so much I went back Monday for supper!I was lucky to have caught the end of Sunday Roast as I arrived at nearly 15:30. You go one block in off Orchard Road and you will first notice the huge amount of outdoor patio seating if you enjoy that...in steamy Singapore I like my air conditioning so I headed inside. Note you can smoke outside while inside is non smoking. The place is pretty large inside and was teeming with folks enjoying the Roast. I was solo, so I made my way to an empty barstool. Now comes the only hiccup-I could not get waited on at the bar-for drink or food. I was noticed by the bartenders but they never approached me. I noticed I was nearing the end of the Sunday Roast so I just sat at one of the few empty tables and was immediately greeted by a friendly server. I put my Tiger Beer order in and decided on the Lamb as I don't eat it very often. While waiting for my food to arrive I got the chance to have a look around and noticed a bunch of tvs-great for catching Rugby & Soccer, as well as any other major sporting event going on in the world. My Lamb arrived and it was some of the best I've ever tasted! A healthy portion surrounded by two kinds of potatoes, 2 veg & even mint sauce in a delightful brown gravy. Extremely pleased with my choice. As I was finishing my 2nd Tiger I noticed some activity near the band area towards the front. I found out live music was about to start!Well, change of plans was needed so I asked my friendly waitress if I could move into the other room to watch/listen to the band (the two rooms are separated by a huge fireplace). I was told no problem, enjoy. Well these guys were just awesome. They played a great mix of cover songs and recent hits that really pleased the crowd. It was just a phenomenal couple of hours spent at Muddy Murphy's. I had plans in the evening so I reluctantly had to depart. By the time I left the place was pretty packed-I'm sure in great part due to the live music.I was in need of a last meal in Singapore on Monday night and said what the heck I will try MM's again and sample the regular menu. I had no trouble sitting anywhere I liked and I had my same waitress from Sunday! I had a large Tiger in record time. I put in my order of grilled ham and cheese with an added egg. It was very good...next time I will have to try fish & chips or a burger-they looked great from what I saw. While waiting for my supper Rugby and Soccer dominated the tvs (fine with me). It was definitely a much more relaxed vibe on Monday night. Sunday was so good-everything from the music/singing to the very authentic tasting Sunday Roast-that I just had to give Muddy Murphy's a 5/5. If you're in Singapore on a Sunday you must come here! I will certainly be back, and hoping to make it for a Roast & live tunes..

Once again a stay at the Orchard Hotel, and once again lunch every day at Muddy's. The staff, atmosphere and food were all as good as expected. The Guinness flows and the great interaction with the staff continues. Declan takes the whip, but I think it the the little "pocket rocket", Jay that does most.If you are up near the end of Orchard road, drop in, say hello to the staff and have a meal - the daily specials are really great value
4
Great bar and restaurant, good beer and the food is excellent. situated in heart of busy shopping area it is great for Sunday lunch and a pint or two of Guinness
4
Moved back above original location from further down Orchard Road. Surroundings are spacious and like a real bar with a lot of outdoor seats and many tv screens with always a good variety of sports. Kilkenny and Guinness are good. Can get very busy and serving staff can struggle but mostly very good. Food is classic bar menu with a few extra spices - fun place to spend time.
5
What an Irish pub you say in Singapore...$29 for three courses with choices.... friendly staff Afl was on so even better. When you have had your fill of local fare pop in here for their weekday lunch specials $12 with a cool drink. Will be back and recommend to all
4
The service is quick, the menu basic but good value, drinks a little on the high side but great for Guinness and Kilkenny addicts.
4
Nice irish pub next to orchard towers. reasonably priced drinks unlike the ones in the four floors. The live band is just outstanding. two of the vocalists one a west indian and the filipino was just too good. we had a few drinks watching some cricket and listening to the band. we had a great evening
5
Good food, fine drinks, cheerful atmosphere, TV screens all around with live sports events.Friendly and efficient staff
4
Located near our quarters, this pub has good food and a good selection of beer and wine. We ate there a couple of times. The wait staff was efficient and helpful. On our first visit I was given a Guinness shirt; what a surprise. It serves Anglo pub food primarily. Would recommend for bar food and drink
2
Wanted a break from Asian, went here, decent beers and drinks, faux Irish setting, uncomfortable bar arrangement, ordered a cheese burger that was microwaved. BARF. Guy next to me had fish and chips that were burned. Grab a pint if you must, might want to avoid the food...........
3
A good place to unwind after the craziness of nearby Orchard Road. Food is good. Drinks on the pricey side, and cost as much or more than the meals. Portions are small
5
We had Sunday lunch here the other day and had a great time! We chose the 2 courses for $24 option and the food was excellent. We went to watch the Grand Prix while we were dining. Gets very busy so worth booking,
4
I started coming to Muddy Murphys 15+ years ago, but had not been there in 10 years. In that time, they had moved from their original location and then recently moved back. They are now on the first floor, they used to be in the basement. In all the moving they have managed to maintain the same atmosphere. It is a fun place to have a few beers and maybe a pub style lunch or dinner. The bar staff are very friendly and is is unusual not to end up in a conversation with an ex-pat or two, also along way from home. The beer is cold, the food is adequate but not fancy. It's nice to know that some things do not change. The only thing I wish they could change would be the location of the rest room. It's quite a hike, you have to leave the bar to the adjacent mall, go up the stairs and around a corner
3
Went for lunch on my birthday with my daughter. She wanted Subway (located next door) and i wanted a meal with a beer. Asked a waitress if ok, she said yes - then nasty, sour faced bar girl said NO. As i'd ordered and Paid she told us to put subway on another plate. Certainly detracted from what was to be a nice birthday lunch. SHAME ON YOU MURPH
4
Popped in here on a Sunday night and showing premier league football from UK. Pub not too busy but good atmosphere and great selection beers and spirits, good service and a fun place to go
4
We went in here on recommendation from colleagues and felt like home, irish pub with sport on. Food was excellent but was more expensive than average
3
The selection of draught beers was good, but I was surprised how expensive an ordinary pint was. The place was packed with people watching the 6 Nations Rugby and there were plenty of TV screens so that everyone could see. Hard working waiters for those wanting table service. Disn't try the food but the dishes I saw were average western stuff
5
If you like Irish pubs, this one is worth visiting. It is located in a mall next to Orchard Hotel where we were staying. Will visit again when I'm Singapore
5
Can't go to singers without a pint in Muddy Murphy's.Good juke box music early on, good food, tiger beer. Excellent live band to finish.Well worth a visit
4
Muddy Murphys is in the mall attached to the Orchard Hotel. It's an Irish Pub that sells beers including Guiness. There is sports shown on the large screens and the food is typical western pub grub. Meals are about Â£10 . Very popular with ex pats especially during major sporting events
3
Its ok if you like sport and expensive drinks, the food is very average, big portions though, beer range is good, does get packed when footy is on which is a good thing for atmospher
4
I was actually looking to lunch at Tony Roma's but discovered Muddy Murphy's in its place instead. After checking out the 'quaint' exterior of the restaurant, I proceeded to check its menu and found a set lunch priced at a very affordable $9.90, GST included. The Chicken Alfredo portion was ample and I got to enjoy it in a countryside-decorated ambience and rustic atmosphere. And yes, a glass of water was actually served FOC! Definitely excellent value for good food and great service
4
When we walked in we felt at home straight away. The staff were very friendly and helpful. After a busy few hours walking up and down Orchard Road it was a lovely place to stop for a Guinness.We ate there and the food was very good, especially the mashed potatoes! A bit expensive but everywhere is in Singapore! Great place if you want to watch live sport too. Will definitely pop back in there before we leave
5
We visited Muddy Murphy's quite a few times whilst visiting our son. This is his favourite bar and we had some wonderful nights watching the rugby on television. The staff are fantastic,food super. Will be back in September and can't wait to see them all again!
5
I watched UFC 207 there with my girlfriend recently. Their screens aren't so large but there are many to watch. Good selection of drinks and snacks and good staff made for a great afternoon of sports
4
It's always great to have a place that you can have a quick catch up without any fuss. The service is always attentive, unhurried and authentic. Even better are the cold beers which goes perfectly well with the Singapore heat. Keep up the great work guys, looking forward to my next visit when I'm in town.
4
Was taken here last week , great staff and lovely atmosphere, a live band playing and just a nice place for a few beers .Never tried the food but it looked great .In a busy part of town and a good crowd in .I will be back again
3
Been here a couple times when traveling through Singapore. The food is always good and the waitstaff friendly. Sitting outside watching the cars go by is relaxing after a busy day. Very convenient located near hotels and shopping. Prices are reasonable considering the area.
5
Muddy's is a great Irish pub, located in a bustling part of Singapore. Suitable for families at lunch and earlier in the evening, but also a perfect venue for a night out for a few drinks with friends. They have live music on the weekends..a real bonus! It is great to have it back in Claymore after its brief move down the road. It is now a much brighter, spacious feeling spot, with a real Irish feel. There are lots of traditional pub fair on the menu and a large range of beers/ales/ciders on tap and in bottles. The customer service exceeded my expectations. Declan, the customer service manager and his team were friendly, knowledgable, attentive and made sure that the experience for me and my family was positive in every way. We will definitely be returning more regularly in the new year

TripAdvisor needs to update their cover photo for this restaurant, which is from the pub before it was rebuilt. Following a complete rebuilding of this side of the Orchard Hotel, which included the addition of a large Cold Storage grocery store, Muddy Murphy's rebuilt and reopened. The pub was rebuilt in as authentic an Irish pub style as you could get in Singapore. They have flat screen TVs throughout and list the games that they will show on their doors, so you can plan ahead to watch a match. The Guinness is fresh, well-poured, and delicious. You will find several authentic Irish dishes on the menu, plus a few other options to please anyone.The staff are great. Give this place a try, even if just for a beer, when you are in the Orchard Road area near the Tanglin Road end. The nearest bus stop is the Delfi Orchard stop on Orchard Road. On our visit last night, we finished off a bottle of Jameson Irish Whiskey we had bought on the night we got the US election results and couldn't finish then. They had put my name on the bottle and saved it for me.The newly resurrected Muddy Murphy's is great. I've added two interior shots. You can enter from Claymore Road, opposite the well-known Orchard Towers, or you can enter from inside the Orchard Hotel by walking through the lobby, passing through a hallway, and coming down an escalator flight.Lastly, and most importantly, they have Scampi Fries. If you are British and have a habit of picking up salty snacks at the petrol station, you may now what I'm talking about. This is the only place outside of England that I have ever found Scampi Fries. Every time I visit Muddy Murphy's, I buy at least six bags. I've uploaded a photo so you know what to look for

I recently stopped in to Muddy Murphy's for their Sunday roast. This is a great location with a traditional pub feel. The atmosphere is open and friendly, on this trip it was pretty busy with the boxing match going on.I ordered the special Sunday roast and the food was good, perhaps not as good as I was expecting but got the job done. The steak was cooked well and came with an odd but good side of mashed and regular potatoes along with some vegetables. I was hoping for some yorkshire pudding as in the picture but was missing.Overall good, great selection of beers, good atmosphere, good service and good pub food at a reasonable pric
5
This is a nice cosy little pub very friendly staff and nice food. We visited every day on our visit to Singapore
4
Title doesn't make sense?I agree. After all, why go to a pub if you're on a hurry.Seating it's not comfortable.Almost feels like they don't want you to stay as long as possible, eat and drink until you can't get up anymore (yes, it happens).Food is very good. Everything on the menu was well presented and fairly well priced. Cold beers on the tap are easy.Monitors playing sports too but doesn't really save it from having uncomfortable chairs for very low tables
5
Friendly service, great staff. Declan, Jay and Victoria a a terrific mob. The Sunday roast is a must. Perfectly cooked beef or lamb, all washed down with a cold Guinness. Grea

Whenever I'm in sing it's the first place I call and it never disappoints. Great food best pint of Guinness in the southern hemisphere wonderful staff
4
We went here to watch the Everton match, the bar was lively with a good atmosphere and the beers were cool and refreshing.
Everton won too!
4
Went to Muddy Murphy's to watch some football and have a few beers. The atmosphere is pleasant and there was plenty of people in the pub once the game started. On a Saturday they have sport on for most of the day including rugby, football, MotoGP and Formula 1.While there we tried some food and ordered the Ploughman's salad plate, it was very nice and worth the $19 SGD you pay for the pleasure. The price of beer is pretty expensive at around $15 SGD for a pint with some variance depending on your choice of beer.There is a Subway store just outside the pub, and a Cold Storage supermarket just below, if you want something cheaper to eat you can head outside for a feed then come back in and continue your session.I will go back there again the beer is cold and they show all the sports I am interested in, plus the staff are very welcoming. Certainly worth a visit if you are in Singapore and it is close to the famous Orchard Towers

The bread and butter pudding is heavy and dense. Seems that it's not made with actual bread but self made dough of flour and water. This pudding is served as a neat block of doughy lump with custard poured over it. It should be light bread layers interspersed with custard. Disappointing. For the right orientation, the chef should try the consistently yummy version at a lunch/dinner buffet at the French restaurant in St Regis hotel just across the road. Please don't bother to garnish the dessert with blueberries and strawberries. Get the basics right first.
5
Used to water here many moons ago in the old basement location and good to see it back in this area. Staff are very friendly and the pub grub is great
4
Went here couple evenings while staying in Singapore, really lively and great atmosphere especially when live bands playing Good selection beers including the Guinness. Staff friendly and it feels like a pub, recommend, have fun

Went there for a drink while waiting to go to the airport. There was only a few customers there but the service was very slow. The owner was sitting at the bar and after we had put in our order and sat down he instructed the barman to provide another drink to a customer who was already there and it was delivered to him straight away, we still had to wait for some time to get our drinks. The drinks were also very expensive but I guess that's not unusual for Singapore

I seem to remember this bar once being in a basement. Now newly refurbished and with a great view over Orchard Road to Orchard Towers so excellent for viewing the local wild life until you are Muddy's closes and you are drunk enough to make that stagger across the road.Bacon Fries and Scampy Fries as bar snacks which are favourites from the UK. Probably number 2 on my list to hang out in Singapore
4
Casual bar / dining atmosphere. They have Happy Hours (note the plural) from 11am -7.30pm daily, with a good range of draft beers / cider on tap and house wines on offer. Just be careful when starting a tab as they may overcalculate your drinks once Happy Hours ends. Had a group buy us 2 rounds of drinks after HHs ended, and were charged for drinks we didn't buy.. Easier to pay at each round than argue with the waitresses at then end of the night!Food and drinks are a reasonable priced for Singapore - though HHs on draught drinks are only about $2SGD cheaper than during non-HHs..Staff are nice and friendly and super helpful. If you want free wifi, just ask for the wifi passwor

Went here for dinner and drinks,The place was crowded so we totally understand that if we will have our dinner,it will be surely a long wait.We were group of 4,we ordered Guiness steak pie, Chicken Burger,Roast beef and,Bacon Sandwich,the waitress informed us about the waiting time, that usually 20mins.or more since theres alot of food orders during that peak,after 5mins,she went to our table to apologize the famous Roast beef was run out,dissappointing to my friends part because he needs to wait and order again,but we said if 10 mins. waiting tme is possible then it will be fine,she suggested Irish stew but no promises about 10.mins..Food was served and worth the wait and it was served fast as expected.Meal was great,compliment to the Chef,and hope to have the roast Beef next time..We ask the bill,but she told us if we can still wait for another 10mins.because she ordered some desserts for us...The staff here was awesome,handling 20 tables pr more,and still manage to get us some Desserts on the house to apologize..All in all great experience and awesome staff unbelievable she's fast,attentive despite of being very very busy...Will surely be back soon..The best Irish Pub!Keep it up

Such a pity - Muddy's has moved back to its home in Claymore Drive, but unfortunately has lost everything else. The food was way below what we used to get - luke warm steak, underdone potatoes ... but most of all very lacklustre service. After pointing this out we were told that 'we're understaffed because it's Singapore'. Sorry MM, that's just not good enough. And we do have a choice ..
5
It was fantastic, my Dad and I watched the St Kilda/Essendon game on the big screen. Drinks were cold.
4
Great little Irish pub in middle of Asia, food was very good, beer was very cold and not too expensive for Singgapore.
4
Great place, lively with a fab atmosphere. There was live music on when I visited and the place was full and buzzing, expats and locals!!
5
Muddy Murphy's is a good place to go down and have a couple of beers, or have a meal. The beers on tap are always chilled and well served. The waitresses are always attentive and friendly. Food is good. I enjoy their spicy chicken drumlets from the bar menu and their mains are also quite good. I have been there several times and have never walked out feeling disappointe
4
nice to be able to relax at the end of the day on a business trip and enjoy a nice pint. GAA games on the tube, decent food, music on occation as well. I stop here when ever i'm in tow
5
Excellent food, efficient staff (well up to Irish bartender level), handy location next to the MRT. Expensive drinks (by Irish standards) but that is the norm for Singapore
4
Always love my Steak and Guinness Pie and there is no better place to get my pie than at Muddy Murphy's. Consistency is key to a satisfied repeat customer and have to say MM has delivered what is needed. The establishment is going back to their original Orchard Hotel in August, hope everything remains the same
4
I came to this Irish Pub back in March 2016 while I was transit in Singapore on my way to Johor Bahru (Malaysia).Great location, great atmosphere, great food, great beer, and the staffs are all friendly and helpful. It's highly recommended to visit when you're in Singapore
5
This is a very good Irish pub. The food is traditional and good quality. The service is brilliant and make any Paddy welcome. GAA is available which is brilliant especially when travelling on your own. Special mention to 2 stall members for their excellent work. Arianna and Joanne who are passionate about their work
1
Why have advertised posters of sport when you don't show it, advertised premier league football and showed none but a pointless rugby game which no one was watching. Poor customer service Disgusting.
5
Brilliant night at Muddy Murphy's partly because Arsenal and England both won and the also the atmosphere makes it a good night. Many screens so that everyone can watch is a good idea.
4
Spent an enjoyable evening here watching the game. Plenty of food choices on the menu and the beer was good. Band was a bit loud but they seemed to play around the sports events on TV.
5
Love this pub, is relaxing , nice staff ,especially manager Diana, who was very welcoming, good beers ,recommend .
5
Went for a meal late afternoon in the week so not as busy as no doubt is in the evening,The service was excellent. Good choice of meals especially if you do not like hot and spicy food. The food came piping hot and was very enjoyable, one of the best meals I had whilst visiting Singapore. We had lamb chops which came with mint sauce and good old fish and chips along with malt vinegar (they do not use this much in Singapore). Did not have room for desert but I am sure they were just as good
4
Visiting Singapore from Japan. Was here during the rugby world cup and managed to watch South Africa play New Zealand here. Great atmosphere! A special thanks to the Caucasian manager who was very friendly and helpful
5
Just want to say a big thank-you to Muddy Murphys & Diana especially for her assistance via email this week. I am travelling to Singapore on Saturday night and we have realised we are travelling during the RWC!!! I had emailed many bars in Singapore to try and find a time to watch a replay of the Rugby on Sunday. Diana got back to me with times it was playing, reserved us a table and has been so helpful! We can t wait to see Singapore and watch the Rugby first thing on Sunday. Amazing Service :
4
We were here to watch South Africa vs NZ rugby game on Saturday night. The multi tasks lady at the bar was on the ball. She took the orders, pour perfect beers and did the bills. Actually this place has been moved from other locations to this present one. We kinda following it around. I wish the kitchen open later than 10.45 p.m. on big matches though. We arrived there at 10.45 and bang! ! No snack
5
One of my favourite water-hole in singapore! Tucked in the less-crowded area of Orchard/Somerset area, Muddy is an excellent spot for catching up with friends and ex-colleagues alike.This Irish bar sports Guiness draft beers and live sport matches. One not to be missed.
4
Great atmosphere and really good pub food, be aware that the portions are generous. Alway sport on the TVs featuring this time the rugby World Cup (union
4
Great venue which served Killiney on tap. Awesome pies, fabulous service, shows the sport and is open late. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the Sunday roast is a bit naff and I'd expect better from a venue that does such great food otherwise.
5
A superb place to hang out with friends over a pint of Kilkenny apart from the other many types of beer they carry. The food is amazing too. Definitely a Must Try.
4
Staffs are friendly, beers cold, food is okay, sports is always on TV. bit pricey drinks if you go outside of happy hour though
4
Tried this pub for Breakfast for the first time. We had been here once before for roast dinner and it was excellent. The pub itself is very small with little space and lots of steps so it's not disabled friendly.We had the big breakfast and bacon butty. My husband didn't like the bacon butty as he didn't like the sliced bread used and said he could have just made this at home himself.The big breakfast was very good with mushrooms, baked beans, potatoes, sausage, tomato and bacon. But the bread was fried bread which I would never have ordered as it's horrible. They need to say this on the menu - the menu description was "toast" which to me meant normal toasted bread to have with butter.Staff are very friendly with fast service. Overall a nice place. We will visit again for roast dinner.Fried bread I didn't like - menu needs to be clearer as it said "toast"Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPhon

I'm amazed with those westerners who found this pub welcoming. We went regularly for Sunday brunch at one point & I couldn't remember receiving any welcome at all by the staff. We didn't mind that.We stopped going because the food were coming slower & slower on each visit. I observed the westerners were served 1st and even those who ordered after us. We looked around and noted we were the only Asian family sitting amongst the westerners. Brunch was good but we felt discriminated being Asian.so if you are Asian & ok to made felt discriminated & prepared to wait for your food after all the westerners are served, then enjoy it. But we couldn't wait nearly an hour for our meals.
4
came with a couple friends for a pint to cool down. Great place to enjoy good atmosphere, stay cool and get a lovely refreshing beer. They had a promotion on and gave my partner a free t shirt. Decent value, and good for groups and families
5
Muddy has the cheapest Guinness in Singapore and they put the shamrock on top. They are cold and the service is very friendly , Jett was serving me for the 2hrs I was there and was very welcoming. I had the all day breakfast which was very filling , next time will try the stew or bangers and mash. I also noticed that the tax and service charge is already included, so it's great. I sat at the bar and the place has a nice atmosphere , even customers are friendly. Will be back next month
4
This is a fun pub with a decent beer selection and pretty good food. The staff is also very friendly and will do a good job looking after you. If you go with the expectations of some good drinks and bar food (certainly not a gastro pub) you will not be disappointed. Enjo
3
I used to make a pilgrimage to this pub in its old location. This was the first chance I've had to try the new one. The same pleasant and efficient staff are there, but the ambiance is all but gone. The food is ok, but nothing special.
4
We were greeted immediately upon entry & shown to our table by a friendly bubbly young waitress. She quickly provided the menus & had our pre dinner drinks to us in next to no time. Although the menu was not extravagant it provided us with plenty of options to satisfy our craving for some western food. We ordered the rack of lamb along with a roast beef & a serving of garlic bread. Although the rack of lamb turned out to be only two lamb cutlets ... when coupled with the generous serving of vegetables was more than ample & quite tasty for a pub meal. The roast was not quite as good but once again proved very filling. The winner for us on the night though was the scrumptious serving of garlic bread .... the best we've had for quite some time with plenty for the both of us. Overall we were very happy with our meal from a quality & cost perspective along with the environment ..... which what we've come to expect from these establishments from past visits. All the staff we encountered were smiling, friendly & keen to assist with our needs

.Pub Staff are a gem !pleasant, jovial, attentive and fast on their feet !Great vibesGood RUSTIC pub atmosphereLots of regulars are always a good signEvent nights can be rather packedand rowdy !!Despite the hypeFOOD is MOSTLY DISAPPOINTINGMeat served cold, gravy congealed .. like it has sat around, forgottenyet the server has oven gloves on, with kind warning remarks of "hot plate"Snacks are over fried, inadequately drainedI have stopped eating hereJust come for drinks, and the atmosphere !The bands can be good .. sometimesA great pub to have locally !We need more choices of ALE !!
4
Cool and quite friendly environment,nice staff and good beers.
If you are in town please come to this bar... You will love it.
5
Nice bar just off Orchard Rd. The bar staff are friendly and courteous. Good venues for watching premier league or rugby.
4
We were only in Singapore 2 nites and wanted a bar .We found this one tucked behind a shopping mall.indoor and outdoor seating.
place clesn and staff friendly
beer prices slightly cheaper than the hotel.
4
Excellent lunch package at SGD12! Very much value for money! Walking distance from my hotel, I was impressed by the beautiful waitresses service! Big Up! Will definitely go there again
4
Find the atmosphere for match days and six nations unbeatable and the staff are excellent and friendly. Great venue and it would earn 5 stars from me if the prices were more reasonable. 15sgd or 10euro for a pint of lager is madness so I just cant justify going there as much as I want. In their defense that maybe the going rate in Sing but for an otherwise genuinely Irish experience having the prices Doubling Dublin prices is a real stinger
4
We live in Orchard area and go here every few weeks either on a Sunday or random night of the week. It's not overly crowded and there's a nice selection of indoor and outdoor seating. The food is good and the beers are aplenty. The service is above average for Singapore. We always get a Speckled Hen. The fish and chips are great. I've had a couple of their salads, which are decent. I know, you wouldn't think to order a salad at a bar, but for the light eater they will not disappoint. It is the type of place that attracts the office crowd during happy hour. And on a big game night you might want to get there early as seats go quickly. Watch out for live music nights, because it can get loud. It's a nice bar, because it is a bit different from all of the others in the Orchard area. A little off the beaten path for a chance of pace and the decor transports you to Europe
3
The prices and atmosphere of the pub is totally fine, as is the location near Orchard Road in Singapore. The pour on the pint of Guinness was a bit disappointing though; if you want to tout yourself as an Irish pub make sure you get your Guinness right!Overall though it wasn't bad at all with a nice menu selection and helpful service at reasonable prices
1
Dear Muddy Murphy, today is my first time to your restaurant with my group of pals. We did some research and it was highly recommended, however I wish to say that the experience that we had today was not only disappointing but to a certain extend we felt discriminated. We were there to celebrate our annual Christmas party and we were completed ignored by your Santa walk around and photo opportunity. The team just completely skip our table which we are not sure if it's because we were the only asian in your restaurant. This was also followed by a group of completely un-attentive services and the chips were also served cold. I sincerely apologies that we did not do research to realized that your restaurant joint was meant for Caucasian and the target audience were not Singaporeans. We will organise our Christmas celebration in another restaurant in future
2
Had my annual xmas dinner celebration with my friends at the restaurant, the service was atrocious. There was a Santarina going around giving out hats and completely ignore us because we were the only Asians. The service was bad as well, had to asked for a few rounds before we even get water. Chips were served cold and the food was mediocre, avoid this place if you do not want to be discriminated
4
Muddy Murphy has moved from its previous location at Orchard Hotel. The new location at Somerset is maybe not as good. But the pub is still very nice, that friendly staff are the same and they serve a very good pub lunch,not not to forget , my favorite pint :Old Speckled Hen.Still a great place
3
Great selections of british and local drinks.. Was there for the world cup ! Bar food could have more selections rather then just friend stuff.. But overall, good drinking hole !
5
I have been a Muddy's fan for many years. My best day is on Sundays from 4:30 till 8pm when the band plays - great music, great staff, great food and reasonable prices. I highly recommend this bar.
4
Loved the chocolate pudding and apple crumble served with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. Highly recommended!
Take it with a café latte for a perfect end to a Sunday lunch.
4
Its new location is about 10 to 15 minutes away from the old location, but they had no choice but move due to property development.Muddy's is now just down the back of Orchard Road, further down from its old position, past Ion and Ngee Ann City (Takashimaya)If not within walking distance, get off the MRT at Somerset NS23The layout was possibly better before, but the new Muddy Murphy's has not lost its character.The beer and cider is just as cold and just as good, as are the live bands and service from the staff.I am back in Singapore in January and will visit again, for sure.http://muddymurphys.com
3
We went with expats to watch the rugby - great spot for it with a fun atmosphere. Beer and wine aplenty, bar snacks. all good and met expectations. The staff did a great job in a really busy time and right space. Our friends noted that the old venue was better and this was harder to find. It's a fun Irish Pub in a big Asian city
4
I think it's older location on Orchard was better, but the pub is now bigger and better. Always a great pub atmosphere, showing all the top sporting events. Service is good even when busy, and the food is what you expect from a Irish pub around the world, but this one is a notch higher. The traditional English/Irish food is spot on if you want some home comfort food. Good selection of beers, and you can sit inside or out weather and temperature permitting
5
After a long flight, a trip to the consulate, we finally found this place around lunch time.. The atmosphere was great - apparently the actual fixtures, fittings and furniture was built in Ireland and then dissembled and reassembled in Singapore - what a great touch that was!.Living in Bali, we found the cost of the beer a little expensive, but the quality of service and the excellent food far out-ways the cost. My dad has sore hips and legs, and as i am a smoker we moved around from the bar to a table to outside and then back to the bar when the rain came down and the staff we so so kind assisting us move tables. NOTHING was a problem for them... and that was when the lunchtime rush was on and there was only 3 font of house staff - not sure of there names, but they need a pay rise!For lunch, Dad had the Bacon Faggots and I had the Beef and Guinness Pie - I could not fault anything with the food and the quality of the meals was great, although too much to eat
4
When visiting Singapore I often utilise hotels on Orchard Road but whenever possible I would visit the near by Muddy Murphy's for drinks and dinner after work. It's a simple establishment with a good pub atmosphere especially at the weekend when a band will be found playing . The food is simple and hearty enough and there is a nice choice of draft beers. The staff are very friendly and proficient and will make you feel welcome, most noticeably Diana and her team who are always willing to chat and ask how your day was
4
I stumbled across this pub when I was in Singapore obtaining a visa for Thailand. The selection of draught beer was excellent and I ordered the fish and chips. I couldn't have cooked it better myself and I am a chef. I visited early in the evening and it was reasonably quiet. The staff made me feel very welcome and engaged me in conversation. I will return there again the next time that I am in Singapore
1
Me and my husband visited Singapore and we decided to go to an irish pub for a few drinks and something to eat. Muddy Murphy's was recommended. We arrived and there was a medium sized crowd in the bar, we waited 15 mins for service. And then when we gave our drink order, they forgot to punch it it. And when we called the staff we had to wait another 15 mins before being served. My husband ordered a punt of lager, it was flat when he received it, we complained but we got no response. We ordered food. It took 45 mins for the food to come. The only word I have for it is Shocking. I had the chicken and my husband had the steak. We just couldn't eat it. My chicken seemed to have been reheated over and over until it was like leather, my husbands steak also was unchewable. We complained and again no response, we paid our bill and left, a terrible experience
4
Great live music, services very fast and friendly. Guinness pie & Chicken burger were very delicious. Restaurant is clean and nice.
We will come again :)
4
Popped into MM's for a fast Guinness and a bite while shopping. A pleasant surprise - friendly staff, a well poured Guinness, and a very respectable bangers and mash. A very enjoyable place to relax and have some fun with friends.
4
They have moved, they are now just down from the MRT entrance on the back side of 313 Mall. They have the same great menu and food. The fish and chips is really great.
5
Bangers and mash at muddies on sommerset! You can't beat it. Perfect. Great decor great atmosphere wonderful food! Kilkenny and guineas on tap. Great weekend music. A great place to chill with friends. Outdoors is t as great as before but still good.
5
Loving the location as its a short walk from my flat! What you see is what you get sort of a place. Nice pub grub, friendly staff and good draft. Its nice to have an actual pub and not another bar!
5
Great Food my wife and I ordered the fish and chips and this was a big serve and good quality.
good value for money, drinks are nice and cold. Nice atmosphere. They are going to move not sure where too. though. Good Guinness. !!!!
4
Good bar with good food. Great atmosphere of an evening and usually nice and quiet for lunchtime. Live bands at weekend. This bar is moving down Orchard Road to the Somerset area.
5
Great location. It has several rooms so if you want to hear the music, sit outside or just find somewhere quiet there's something for you.It was also perfect for our large group (20+ people). The staff was superb and kept us our drinks full the whole night. They went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed ourselves.Drinks prices are what you would expect, with happy hour taking of a couple of dollars per drink. Food was good too with quite a bit of variety.We will definitely be back, thanks
2
It has average atmosphere. The location is not that great for a pub- in the middle of a shopping Centre. Very overpriced for an average meal for 4 people (3 mains and 1 enters), 3 softdrinks and 1/2 pint of beer, $93 sd, 7% gst &10% service charge. Australian = $87. No way I would pay that at home for average pub grub
5
went for a bite to eat, had the fish and chips - excellent. I was sitting at the bar, and noticed a couple of other dishes that looked great. Looked like the pies were great as well. There was a good bad playing, Raw Earth, and if you like classic rock and roll tunes, they were also great
5
Great food and nice atmosphere. The Irish Stew was excellent and the service was prompt. Would recommend.
3
Wonderful position and a great atmosphere but the Guinness was lifeless. The local beer was just fine and the service was good.
4
Every time I get to Singapore I try to visit Murphy's. I like the pub and the beer they have. The food is different for Singapore and a nice change.
3
We had a lunch special in the bar which actually was very quiet. The food quality was pretty average but the value was fantastic. On the basis of value for money it would score 5 but taking everything into account a score of 3+ is more appropriate
5
What a brilliant Irish pub. We went there on the recommendation of a friend who makes it his local when in Singers.The Guinness is exceptional, served nice and cold just like the air conditioning. The fish and chips were great and the service friendly and efficient. What more could you want....another pint please Muddies
3
Caught up with an old friend for a drink and meal here this past week, and its not advertised as a quality eatery so expectations are not high but it was adequate. Central location off Orchard across from the infamous Four Floors of Ladies (Orchard Towers) and is good for gatherings a beer and a chat, food was okay but expensive and service was very good. The Irish theme isn't that Irish of course but don't let that throw you off
4
It's in the basement of a building with access from outside the building (next to Orchard Towers), just off Orchard road so if you're not careful you might miss it.It's a quaint traditional Irish pub with good beer, good food and a lovely old world Irish ambiance
4
Just popped in for a beer and shepherd's pie. Food and beer was OK although pricey (welcome to Singapore). Service exceptional though - just blowing on a forkful of very hot shepherds pie, and the waitress walks over to check if I want some ice water also. Nice
3
A completely average bar. Nothing special but nothing really bad about it, except if you are sitting too close to the band. The beer is fine, seats outside in the sunken outer area are your best bet (B1 level, but sort've "open air" to the street level above). The food is nothing to write home about, but seems popular with the local finance crowd.If you are in the area, then sure...why not. But by "in the area" I mean within a block or two, then check it out. Otherwise, there are much more interesting options for a pint
4
It had everything that you would expect from an Irish pub in Asia. Pretty typical menu - pretty well executed. We were there with lots of kids in tow and all were fed - though they had run out of desserts which was disappointing. They did allow us to get icecreams from the 711 so not so bad.Food good, though the Irish stew is more casserole that Irish Stew. Some portions were more generous than others - Pork ribs were tasty but disappointingly small (and not a cheap item on the menu).Service was good - were were there with a large group and everything went smoothly. No complaints on that front.Would retur
4
The exterior section is usually crowded with a large group who all know each other vaguely. The interior is dark and clean (unlike the shared toilet). When the live music starts it is loud, but no ears would bleed.
3
Quiet and "safe" pub to have a pint or two alone or with friends, no loud music or "trouble". No wi-fi available
5
It does what it says on the tin, an Irish Pub in Singapore. Great beer, food and surroundings which all make for a great night chatting with friends.
3
Came to Muddy's with a few colleagues on a business visit last October. Most of them are regulars and recommended this pub on a Thursday evening. The exterior deck was full when we arrived so we sat inside by the window. The seating area was a bit tight but sat all 6 of us. The lighting was dim inside and the place was loud. Not only was the music loud for a pub this size but everyone was screaming to hear each other. We started of with a few cold Tiger beers. The menu was simple and had a promising selection. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala. It was not the best but ok. The beers must of been the highlight of my visit. They were nice and cold.The prices are reasonable and the service was slow but attentive. I must say, it sure is a great place to hang out with friends
3
Good Irish pub, wines aren't cheap but nevertheless good value. Food was served quickly, hot and reasonable quality, atmosphere good. Seems to be a popular place for office parties so expect some limitations in both service and table availability. Worth going for happy hour, but lacks the true spirit of an Irish pub.
4
I like Muddy Murphy's. It works for me. It reminds me of my student days in Cork City in Ireland. Loud, chaotic, full of interesting people and music. It is not really an Irish pub but more a fusion of Irish and Englsh pub cultures with some American-Irish traits thrown in. It caters to the Irish and English expats and visitors in Singapore and the wannabees. Expect to find a packed bar at the weekends, festivals (real or imaginary) and any major sporting event. Very friendly staff, good pub food and an excellent selections of drinks
5
my friday night hangout. there is always a great band on and this last trip was no exception. the food is awesome and they have a great selection. the beer is good as well, with Kilkennys on draught or Tiger if thats your preference, with everything else inbetween.Downside/upside depending on your point of view is the proximity to the infamous Orchard Towers with its many ladies of "negotiable virtue"
5
I like Muddy Murphy's and have done for many years. It’s not to everyone's taste, but that's a large part of the appeal. It is after all is said and done a pub and it attracts a pub crowd - warts and all. What I particular like about Muddy Murphy's is its commitment to ensure that important celebrations of Irish (and British) heritage and folklore are not lost.It was a lucky coincidence that I was there recently for the celebration of St. Tinea Pedis Day. Affectionately known as - St. Tinea’s. An ancient Anglo Saxon ritual, celebrating the discovery of the cure for Athlete's Foot. The throwing of shoes symbolising the sufferer is cured. That the significance of this simple act, helping to keep alive our ancient traditions of heritage and culture, should be lost on someone from a nation with neither should come as no surprise. And it is important to remember that the most profane statement of expulsion is integral to this important ritual - thereby bidding good riddance to the fungus (or should that be Fergus). If St. Tinea's at Muddy's has gone some way to rid Muddy's of another unwanted affliction - the ex-pat prissies, then good on them. God Save the Queen
1
A Friday afternoon on a public holiday was spoilt by the boorish behaviour of a large, loud group of corpulent, heavily drunk expats comparing beer guts and swearing loudly without any consideration for others.A jolly jape of a game that seemed to entertain these simian morons was throwing their shoes around. Having been hit by one, and remonstrating loudly, I was surprised to see the weak spineless Irish manager not take issue with their ignorant and invasive performance but simply slink back in the dark dingy interior where he, presumably, hoped no would bother him.I have never liked this bar, famous in Singapore for its legendary rude staff who seem to have perfected the art of having no peripheral vision and even to look straight through you should you ever deign to seek their assistance.It has never deserved a high recommendation and certainly not from me after the coarse and unrestricted performance of a tedious bunch of over-fed, over-watered boring and vulgar drunksThere are far better bars in Singapore than this plastic Irish mess - cross over the road and go to Harry's bar and avoid the middle-aged louts playing out their sad past lives
3
Muddy Murphy's was completely built in Dublin then dismantled. moved to Singapore and rebuilt by professional Irish pubfitters. The decor and ambiance are perfect. The crowd is Expat. The prices are high, the food is just OK. The beer selection is limited but the Guinness is fresh. It's a good place for a pint and live classic rock
5
Have visited Singapore many times,and always visited Muddy Murphy's. Great entertainment,good food,and fantastic staff.Its a shame that I live so far.WALES !!! Love SINGAPORE
3
Visited only once. Few draft beers choice ( beer was good and expensive), chips - just a joke. Real junk. Service was ok.
4
The place to be for the 6 nations. A very good pint of Guiness too!
3
Very comfortable, very friendly. Good cold beer. I liked it.
4
Irish stew was great, serves Guiness and a good selection of draught beers, shows live football and is a great craich, what more could you want.
3
Muddy Murphy's is for me still the place to have a beer and some snacks after a working day in Singapore. Kilkenny and the usual snacks, sitting outside, relax, getting easily contact to other business guys hanging out there - I like the place. Service is a bit slow nowadays, and the prices are high - Singapore phenomenon
3
At one stage, Muddy Murphy was THE place on that stretch of Orchard Road to hang out ..but now with a proliferation of pubs and bars ..there are alternatives. If you like the rough crowd, noisy expats etc ..then by all means step down to Muddy Murphy ..but for the same pint of Guiness and good pub grub ..I get better value at Harry's next door. I guess Muddy Murphy has its regular clientele, plus it is a stepping stone to Orchard Towers. Somehow the Irish theme has faded..just too many of it in Singapore ...if you like good beer ..try an Erdinger at Harry's , or even a King Ludwig at Shiraz's kiosk in front of the Hilton. For a good pint of Kilkenny's head to the Sportsman Bar above Harry's at the Far East Shopping Centre, just next to the Hilton ..and you get good life music, Muddy's is overrated and expensiv

When visiting Singapore Muddys's will never let me down. Great location, fresh beer & even better bar snacks. If you a pub person (like I am) visit Mud's for a proper Singapore pub scene discovery and if you really want to be entertained ask to meet Mr. Steve Baggy...... Cheer

When you step into the pub, you are able to "sniff" the ambience! It's really lovely and there is much attention to detail to make it as authentic as possible. Muddy Murhpy's is very "happening" with lots of various events going on, from football matches, rugby games - and just recently the oyster shuckling competition. I love the variety of Beers - Old Spekled Hen being my favourite. The food menu deserves mention as well, as not only can you only get a pint or two - you can get wholesome and very decent pub food! A very well run pub and it has been so for years. Congratulations

The Pub is across the street from the Hilton Hotel... The menu is very good for a Pub and they have lots of beer to choose from. If you smoke this is your place because if you sit outside you can smoke in one place, we don't smoke but you would never know anyone was smoking if you didn't see them light up.. The wait staff could use a few lessons on customer service, we sat down and they walked by us as if we weren't there, my wife finally had to get up and go get someone and then we were OK... There is one ramp into the building for someone who is in a wheelchair or can't do steps and then you can take the elevator down to the Pub but beware they close and lock the door to the ramp before the Pub closes if you're in a wheelchair you have a problem.....

Here is an "Irish" bar with some genuinely great food.The drinks are are uber expensive but then everything is expensive here. Saw in he New Year here and the Guiness is very drinkable

Expensive, you pay for everything. Nice atmosphere if crowded, average selection of beers.

I went there like once a month in past year..the price for drink and food is o.k and the taste of food is average (acceptable).

Our second visit to Muddy Murphys, were there last time in 2007. Brilliant place, lovely food and good value for money. Great atmosphere and wonderful staff. Sunday Roast mmmmmm

We stayed at the Hilton and as the saying goes you can find an Irish pub anywhere. We were lucky enough to have one across the street. Muddy Murphy's is a typical Irish pub with a nice atmosphere and TV's so you can watch whatever sports are going on at the time. The Guiness and KilKenny beers were cold and delicious, the food was fair (I had the pastrami sandwich which barely had any meat on it) and it was only fair. The menu is so-so so my recommendation is go for the beer and skip eating there. There are just too many other good places in Singapore to waste your money there

Watched one of the games of The Rugby World Cup 2011 with my husband. We were just a couple hanging out... but by the time the game finished, we had a small group of friends around us and we sat and chatted even more after the game was finished.You gotta to try their chicken wings snack.... LOVED it!!... Spicy and oh so crispy!We have been going to that pub for years whenever we visit Singapore but felt it was time for a special mention of this pub because it is truly a gem in Orchard Road

The pub was wall to wall people during the Liverpool-Manchester U soccer game. However the crowd was really subdued with little cheeringduring the game though there was lots of talk making the pub very noisy. The beer was good, the pub food nothing to write home about

This a bar with a menu, not a restaurant with beer. I've been in here many times, it's a good ex-pat bar, and people from all walks of life seem to congregate here. I've often eaten their burgers in between pints of Guinness - they make good soakage. Be aware - beer is expensive here

I have been to Muddy Murphy's a couple of times and one thing is always consistent....They dont fill the beer glasses up and the price is high. The food is ok although the service is slow. There are a lot better places in Singapore than this

Agree with other reviewers, this place charges too much for what they offer. The quality is fine, bacon sandwiches were awesome, the beer was pretty good too. Servings were small and drinks were "short" every time. Poor value for money. Also quirky in that there are no washrooms, youy have to use the public facilities in the mall next door. Staff pleasant enough but never in a hurry. The atmosphere is good, very relaxed and friendly
