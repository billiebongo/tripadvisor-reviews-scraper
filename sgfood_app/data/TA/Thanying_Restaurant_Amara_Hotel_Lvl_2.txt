The restaurant was amazing

The staff were also great

The food was extremely good and nice . Although service was ok everything else was fine would definitely recommend this place
5
Tried a few dishes and all were good. Could find no flaws and I like all of the dishes. service staffs were attentive. Very authentic thai food.
4
We had a team dinner at Thanying and everyone enjoyed it. The green papaya salad was nice although I accidentally ate a chili which was pretty hot. The Tom Yum soup, green curry, spicy fish in a broth, fried rice and mango sticky rice were all great. I also had a cold lemongrass tea which was very refreshing.
4
This is one of the "safe" Thai restaurant to go for business lunch. Nice atmosphere but a bit pricey. Would recommend the Tom Yum Pranwns, stuffed chicken wings, Garoupa Fillet with spicy sauce. Both "mango salad" and "Pomelo Salad" are fantastic. The dressing for the pomelo salad is very awesome.They have a desert buffet which is very nice but I am usually too stuffed to go for that and end up just having Mangoes.The service here is also very good especially from the "Thais" that have been there for many years
4
Had dinner with best friends as only 2 out of the group had eaten before in this restaurant. This restaurant has been there for many years and it still looked the same. Maybe time to refurbish to make it look more "modern" look to attract younger generations. Food is still good especially loved their appetisers and soups, could not find any flaws. But the pineapple rice was disappointed as it is not served inside pineapple anymore, not as attractive in look. Service staff were attentive
5
If you really want to enjoy the authentic Thai flavours then this is the go to place. Enjoyed a hearty dinner with family friends. The raw papaya and mango salad were exquisite so was the Tom yum soup. The red curry and green curry are their vegetarian specialities. Top it up with the delicious sweet sticky rice and mango dessert. The service is very quick and the staff extremely courteous. One thing they don't compromise on is the last order. So be in time if you want to enjoy the great ambience and delicious authentic Thai !

Attentive staff and the food was great. Had lunch with colleagues and business partners.The room has a Thai ambiance to it
3
We generally like Thanying restaurant for its food, specially due to they vegetarian options offer for Thai cuisine which is rare in Singapore. The food is very good most of the time but can be inconsistent in taste and preparation at times. Service is usually very good as well. On the last visit, Durai was excellent. I would still go back for the brown curry, which at times is fantastic
4
Thanying is a hard place to review. Some dishes are consistently excellent, others are not even average. Salads are superb, soups are very good and most curries are good. However, fish dishes are inconsistent and stir frys and deep fried dishes are generally overcooked and dry. Produce is passable but not at a good level considering the price. Overall, it is one of Singapore's best Thai restaurants and worth a visit but make sure to order carefully
5
My son wanted a birthday party with staycation. We chose the hotel and the services is superb and the hotel is well maintained. Much better than expected and will definitely go back again.
3
Truly disappointed with Thanying.Used to love this place. Heard a rumour that it shifted then another Rumour that it closed down but all not true.So I went again with a Friend for lunch.Never ever had such a bad meal here before.Everything was stiff.Chicken wings was so hard. Not tasty at all. Used to love this.Tomyum clear soup - okay.Minced pork with basil leaves - so so. Not served hot.Crab stuff with meat which is really horrid. Used to be just crabmeat which was so much better.Totally disappointed
5
We had a family dinner at thanying - a restaurant which we have oft visited ... and again # the service was excellent , # food great and consistently good and # a Wide variety of vegetarian options. Would continue to visit
5
This family run Thai restaurant in the middle of the Amara Hotel was truly excellent. I was taken there on a Saturday lunch time by a business colleague. What a wonderful location. If you would rather not spend all your time shopping or would welcome an authentic Tom Yum or Thai Green Chicken Curry - you will not be disappointed. If you are aiming to go during the week or evenings, I would recommend booking in advance
5
a lovely dinner at this marvelous restaurant again. visited this nice Thai restaurant again after a few years and it still met my expectations. real good Thai food, lovely atmosphere, friendly people. this must be on of the better Thai restaurants in Singapore
4
Met a friend over lunch. Ordered the following for sharing: Tom Yam Goong, Pad Nor Mai Farang (stir-fried asparagus and mushrooms), Pineapple Rice (not so good), and crab omelet (average). The runaway winner is the dessert buffet containing cut fruits and Thai sweets-- generous in terms of variety and taste (and only 9sgd per person!)
5
Came here twice in a month because the food were truly impressive.Spicy and pricy but all worth it.You should try! Staff are friendly,food came really quic
5
Have been dining here several times and still find the food amazing. They have a very good choices of thai food available. Eating here brings back memories from our trip to Thailand. Though the price is above average, it would surely be worth it. For sure we would be dining here again as we always find the food here delicious
5
Went there for lunch today. The thai food there was very delicious. Recommended dishes chilli prawns, fried egg with pork, stuff chicken wing, tomyam prawn soup. Service was prompt and good as well
4
Great Thai restaurant for quick lunch...!Staff very friendly and decent value for money! If you like true spicy Thai food and comingle with localites, definitely a go
4
Thanying is probably the best Thai Restaurant in Singapore in terms of quality and presentation. Slightly more pricey than most other Thai restaurants but the quality of food and ambience, make up for it. There is a private room.
4
The restaurant is supposed to be one of the oldest running Thai Restaurants in Singapore. Very busy at Lunchtime, so best to book before going.
4
One of the few Thai restaurants that offers great range and good value. The dessert buffet is very good.
4
My wife and I enjoyed the excellent Thai food served. Must try their Sambal Kang Kong, Green curry Pork and their sweet and sour fish..
3
Thai food in Singapore sounded more like Chinese rather than Thai to me.The service was excellent, food quality was very good, cleanliness was excellent, however I did not get the authenticity of the Thai food there.Make sure you start with the fresh coconut juice
5
For authentic Thai like you have never had before try this classy Thai restaurant in the Amara Hotel in Singapore. Every dish is an experience with rich exquisite flavours. The presentation is excellent and service very good. Old favorites like Penang curry are given new life and the dessert table was incredible! Definitely will be a highlight of your Singapore visit
5
Thanying restaurant is one of the oldest Thai restaurant in Singapore. A revisit after many years impresses me even more not only that besides maintaining its food quality, it's service is also impeccable. From the moment one approaches the restaurant, one is greeted by warm smiles, the Thai way, Throughout the restaurant as one is being led to the table, it's warm smiling greetings from every service staff. The captain takes pain to ask for every detail as to how one would like one'a food. Would I like the curry to be less spicy or very spicy? Would I like the chillies in the olive rice to be removed since I like my food less spicy. When the pandan leaf chicken arrived, the captain actually asked and removed the pandan leaves at the side before presenting it again. Waiting staff are always at one nearby corner waiting to serve. This is indeed rare in Singapore restaurants unless one is paying a high price at a fine dining restaurant. The prices for the food is very reasonable abd the ambience elegant, festive and warm. I recommend the otah, olive fried rice, pandan chicken and fluffy pork omelette. In fact most fishes are above average. The dessert bar is a not to be missed. Do check it out or even have some dessert before ordering food portions. True to its claim, Thanying is truly a royal restaurant with a royal kitchen to boast of
4
We must have visited this restaurant 20 times and the food consistency and flavors are the same. They have a separate vegetarian menu which is fairly extensive and delicious. Pricing remains the only negative aspect ( it's fairly high) and that would prevent frequent visits and make it only worthy of occasions
5
Though have some choices for the veggie food, need to add some more dishes (particularly spicy), to attract more crowd, as the speicy food, why we go for Thai food
3
First of all I have to say that I am Thai and I know how authentic Thai food should taste like.This is my first time visiting Thanying restaurant after hearing many positive comments from my friends (both Thai and non-Thai) - it's a casual business dinner with my boss. The atmosphere is like a typical old style (almost run down) Thai restaurant that you can find anywhere in Thailand but I expected more since the restaurant is part of the hotel. We ordered tom yum goong (prawn spicy soup), stir-fried kailan with salted fish, minced chicken basil and rice (plus 2 x Singha beer and lemongrass tea). The stir-fried kailan with salted fish and minced chicken basil were beautifully cooked. The taste was just like what I would have in Thailand. However, tom yum goong is very disappointing. From the first spoon-sip of the soup, I could tell from the scent and the taste that they used the concentrated lime juice to season the tom yum and it's not the good one! The scent of this tom yum reminded me of the cleaning liquid!This restaurant is not cheap - the bill came at SGD 114 for what we ordered. One lime doesn't cost that much and tom yum goong is one of the well-known Thai dish...they should have done way way way better!If you ask me, I don't think I will go back to Thanying any time soon. Although the stir-fried kailan with salted fish and minced chicken basil were exceptional but I can also find similar taste (I have to admit that, not as good as the ones at Thanying) but more reasonable price
4
Good taste and good place for gathering with family and Business. Don't forget to try the dessert (like sticky rice with manggo).
4
try the Tom Yam Soup, bit spicy perhaps but otherwise excellent, friendly waiters, a good selection of wines
2
Quite disappointed with quality of the food. Having lived in Thailand I struggle enjoying Thai food outside of Thailand as authentic. This was one of those experiences. 'Do you want Thai hot Tom Yam Gung?' Then make it almost uneatable. Not impressive.
4
We were a group of vegetarians and they has a good veggie selection as well. We liked the brown olive rice, Som tam and mango salad

@TheKuoKnowsThere is no shortage of places that serve good Thai food in Singapore. They range from the very affordable hawker stalls to the many stand-alone restaurants.But Thanying Thai towers head and shoulders above the rest.If you are after cheap-and-cheeful, burn-the-roof of your mouth stir fries, then Thanying could disappoint both the wallet and the pallet. Its prices can be slightly more than average. It's flavours are a little more subtle and discerning too.But if you are after food that appeals to the the taste buds; is attractively presented and is full of aroma, then Thanying, which is located on the first floor of the Amara Hotel in Tanjong Pagar, should excite the cullinary senses.Despite being a bit more expensive, it is, nevertheless, a popular lunchtime destination of choice for people who work in the area. So do consider booking.The Thai green chicken curry, the beef and basil and the tom yam kung, which are some of my favourite Thai dishes, were some of the best, I have had anywhere. The portions were quite generous too. So generous, in fact, that I had to pass on the lavish desserts table, which was a pity. But next time, I will know better

Recommended by our hotel concierge, this established restaurant (been serving customers for over 28 years) is a treasure. We were the only non-Asian guests, a great sign, and asked the maître d' for recommendations. We had read about their chicken legs/wings?? So with some trepidation we ordered them as a starter. WOW. These legs were HUGE and prepared by taking out the meat, seasoning it, restuffing the legs and deep frying them. They were sensational and filling. We also read about a meat red curry dish. Our server knew exactly what we wanted. When it came we were worried that we were too full to consume it all - shared one portion for the two of us. So limited the amount of rice we were being served. We conservatively doled out two small portions from a soup like large bowl, and were directed to crumble the dried stingray over our serving of the soupy mixture and rice. WOW. the flavor, aroma and sensory impact was so significant. We then piled on more rice and cleaned the bowl completely. We unqualifiedly recommend this restaurant to everyone
4
We went ( 2 families with young children; 3 kids in total ) for a quiet new year celebration. Place is not crowded. Food is great. I'm not a big fan of spicy food so i love the non-spicy tom yam soup. Service is good. Pricey. no parking fee. A pair of peacocks roam the hotel area. Gardens up the stairs were lit. Had a magical feel about it. Overall, a great evening out.

The Thanying Thai restaurant is not your normal Thai dining experience of heavy curry sauces and nuclear hot seasonings. This is fine dining fit for royalty, literally.The restaurant itself is elegant and refined with attentive service. There are rich teak wood furniture, white linen adorned candle lite tables, and beautiful Thai art pieces and wall decoration.  The Thanying Restaurant is from the former chef of the Thai royal family so each dish is created for the royal palate. Meticulous effort is put into the preparation and the presentation and served in the tradition of Thai Court Cooking, everything is in bite-size portions, and all seeds, bones and pith had been removed for the convenience of the pampered diners.Each dish appeals to your sight as well as taste buds. The Gai Hor Bai Toey which is marinated chicken wrapped in pandan leaf is a particularly delicious and interesting dish. It is a chopped spices, chicken, and other veggies served on a leaf. One then wraps and then eats all in a delicious mouthful of flavor in a delightful presentation. Another most memorable dish is the boneless chicken wings. These are far from chicken nuggets. Each wing is deboned, and the meat removed. Its is then chopped, seasonings added, and then its but back into the wing skin and fried. Absolutely delicious and you’ll think about this next time your order wings at the pub. One of the many enjoyable main courses was the Pla Kao Sam Ros which is a deep-fried boneless whole grouper topped with spicy and sour sauces. Desert was also a treat with mango and sticky rice and their signature dish the Mun Sam Pra Lung which is steamed and chewy tapioca in coconut cream served over ice. The Thanying Restaurant is a wonderful Thai fine dining experience. It’s is a highly awarded restaurant voted among the best by many food critics, press and the culinary industry. It is an experience that should not be missed during your stay at Amara or when in the area

I had not been here in years and it was a company work function. It was absolutely excellent the food was first rate. The Thom Yum was the best i had had in ages and the cod fish in a lime broth was amazing.Ill go back
4
Hotel dining is always difficult especially when there for a business lunch but here you will not be disappointed. The food is awesome with some great authentic tastes with a brilliant little Tom Yum Soup. The service is good and the restaurant was full considering it was lunch. However the highlight of the meal was the traditional Thai pudding definitely a must ensure you leave space and try everything and don't be afraid to ask what it is as you will enjoy the experience far more
5
This place has been in Singapore a very long time, it has maintained it's quality and taste very much like Bangkok thai food. So it is really worth money. I like yam pla dok foo, kao tang... just to name a few.
4
Absolutely authentic food and very tasty .order the green thai curry, steamed fish with lemon juice and garlic. the greens are very fresh and the dessert of mango sago and coconut rice is delicious. must visit if u craving thai food
5
Well established thai restaurant with elegant relaxing ambiance. Food was absolutely delicious. Would recommend the whole sea bass with lime coriander and chilli. I was so full that I couldn't manage their sweet buffet. This is a first for me. Would definitely recommend
4
Excellent Thai food with a variety of Delicacies to choose from, since it is difficult to find Halal food better to check if not best option is Sea Food
3
One of the better Thai restaurant in Singapore. However prices are steep.
If you are craving for Thai food with nice environment, you can try Thanying.
Prices are double that of good restaurants in BKk.
5
This is the best Thai food in Singapore! Amazing food, excellent service and tranquil ambience! The staff will keep topping up your rice portions until you are full! Always leave this restaurant feeling content and satisfied after a hearty meal.
4
Been here todya for lunch and had amazing tom yum soup with salad. And main course was smoked rubs with garlic sauce and guey teow rice noodles. Had a great time and great food.
5
Ordered my usual Tom Yam and Pad Thai Moon Goong. Amazing. The place is very quaint, the staff very attentive and the food delicious. Really nice Thai Restaurant. I also found it great value for money and the portions extremely large. One portion feeds 2 just fine
5
My family and I frequent this restaurant as it is one of the few in Singapore which offers Thai cuisine at such standards. Special recommendations would be the deep fried (whole) fish, the different curries whether red or green, the deep fried stuffed chicken wings and of course, the dessert buffet (the main reason why I frequent this restaurant). The fact that the service we have enjoyed had been great during our numerous visits helped in our wonderful dining experience, and restaurants would do well to remember that the food, while important, is not everything when you are running a restaurant. Service should be accorded the same level of attention and it appears to me that the management of Thanying Restaurant is well aware of this. I would always go back to this restaurant whenever I crave for Thai cuisine =) Highly recommended! *thumbs up

I've been dining here for over 25 years. The quality of food has been consistently excellent through the years which is an amazing feat in itself. The tastefully lavish decor and fine service makes this a white tablecloth restaurant that delivers not only superb food but elegant ambience and service. This is clearly my favourite Thai restaurant in Singapore.My family and I ordered a wide variety of dishes â€“ pamelo salad, som tum (green papaya salad), yum woon sen (seafood glass noodle salad), tom yum goon soup, deep fried whole groupa, stir fried kangkong, pad thai, green chicken curry and glutinous rice with durian. Everything was perfectly prepared, flavours and texture were on point, presentation was beautiful and service was refine and exquisite. This is not your everyday restaurant due to the price point, but a lovely place for the occasional splurge or a celebratory meal.My one disappointment during this meal was that the restaurant was out of young coconut which is so ubiquitous and a lovely complement to a Thai meal. To me, that is tantamount to Starbucks running out of coffee, McDonalds out of coca-cola or a Japanese restaurant out of green tea. For that reason, I am rating this restaurant as 4 instead of 5 stars
4
Good Thai cuisine with a friendly service. Papaya and Green mango salad are to be tried as appetizer. Very good fish and seafood noodles. Atmosphere is quiet and calm.
4
Pleasently surpised, good thai food green curry was very good.
I have to say that a little pricy
Service was very good.
4
The restaurant has a nice feel to it. The ambiance is welcoming and the interiors are ethnic in content and style. We found the taste and texture of the food to our liking. The distinct Thai flavors and taste made our meal much more enjoyable.
4
The food was very authentic and tasty! I will recommend one should visit this restaurant for food during their stay at The Amara.
5
thai food in this restaurant is really good . Little expensive , good ambience . mostly all dishes are good as have tried few and been few times .
2
I'm sorry to say that we had a poor meal at Thanying. Offerings were standard Thai dishes but I think the chef got the seasonings all wrong. The pomelo salad was too sweet, the pandan chicken was too salty. The Tom Yang Goong not spicy enough, and the Claypot Glass Noodles, supposedly a prawn dish had bacon (??!) in it, which gave it a funny medicinal smell. The green chicken curry was again too sweet. Lastly, the rice was a lump of goo. Surely that's not right? I was there as a guest so I can't comment on the price of the meal but I can't imagine that it was cheap when a small glass of lemongrass tea (not a lot of flavour in it) was S$7.00. The only thing I can say is that the staff do try hard to please. Again, because I was a guest, I couldn't very well send the dishes back. Definitely won't go there again
4
My love of Thai food has brought me to this place during another trip to Singapore. After more than a few good Thai places I found previously I had high expectations but the place delivered and the meal was delicious. I had Tom Yam soup which was very good although not as flavoursome as I was expecting. Dried shrimp and pomegranate salad was superb - crunchy, pungent, sweet, spicy - marriage made in heaven. Then there was cod in some sort of sour and spicy soup. The fish was great - falling apart and cooked to perfection but the soup was actually the star of the dish. Amazing, well-balanced taste so good I could have had a bowl of this on its own. Two curries followed - green with chicken and red with beef - both spot on - spicy in the right way and packing bags of flavour. All this with some yellow rice served with chicken floss - nice savoury counterbalance to an otherwise fairly bland rice. I had some veg sides which while nice-looking was similar to Chinese pak/bok-choi which I thoroughly hate when it is served warm and vinegary and somehow I always seem to get in Asia ;) All in all the meal was fantastic and I have another Thai place on my list of fave places in Singapore
4
Location good. Reservation suggested as seems to busy most of the days. Good Thai cuisine with a friendly service. Papaya and Green mango salad are to be tried as appetizer. The clear soup Tom Yang for vegetarians was superb. Good choice for vegetarians. Portions perfect for Asians, maybe less for the Europeans and Americans. Good choice for business lunch or family dinners. Pricey
3
I found the reputation a bit over rated. The Clear soup Tom Yam Gai was tasty, spicy as it should but of small proportion. Similarly in proportion for the Larb Gai salad which was not thrilling. For instance the same dish at INDOCHINE is far more tastier, better prepared with more discerning ingredients and of nier proportion in your plate.Dessert Buffet is nice and offer good pastries. All in all just an ok experience
2
The food was mediocre, nothing special. Spring rolls starter were tasty but chicken cashew main dish had too many cashew nuts and not enough chicken. The chicken that was in the dish was quite chewy.At 10.15pm, before we had our main course, we were asked to order dessert as the kitchen was closing. They then started clearing away the dessert buffet and were done by 10.30pm.Apart from that service was polite and attentive.Restaurant was almost empty and lacking in atmosphere
5
Loved the food and it was authentic thai for sure. the padthai was good. the ambience was good but a little noisy
4
Authentic Thai food. Excellent presentation and taste that will surely garner admiration from your business guests from overseas!
5
We had gone there for dinner on 28th september. The restaurant was small but very beautiful and part of Amara Hotel at Sentosa island of Singapore . We four had a comprehensive meal consisting of seafood soup, chicken and prawn starters , green curry chicken, phad thai , desert and cocktail drink of each one's choice. choice of desert was very limited. The food was simply fantastic and probably the best thai food we have taken in recent time. great location of the hotel is an added attraction
4
I was at Thanying on September 18, 2014 with a couple of friends. We had mango salad, green pork curry with dried fish, asparagus spears, steamed sea bass, thai omelette and steamed rice. It was lot of yummy spices and flavors. It's as close enough to the real thing to make your taste buds rock.The service was quick and efficient. Of course, it wasn't really crowded at 730pm on a Thursday night. But i think it wouldn't have mattered. The staff was attentive.The only hitch? A bit pricey. But it's located in a hotel so I guess it's to be expected. I'd go again when my urge for thai-liscious food hits me
4
Had lunch with a friend here. Though we had not booked a table we were lucky to get one as this place gets very crowded being located in the business district. We started off with coconut water which was divine, cold and very sweet. This was followed by the Tom Yam seafood soup which was delicious. The main course was chicken in Thai green curry with steamed rice and a steamed Vietnamese basa fish in lemon sauce. Both dishes were absolutely fantastic with subtle flavours. We ended our meal with a ice cream. This place is definitely worth a visit with your family and friends
4
Thanying is on level 2 of the Amara Hotel in Tanjong Pagar. Its been around for ages and is a nice place for dinner or a weekend lunch. Probably not a 100% authentic (you need to go to Golden Mile for that....I am sure that they have toned down the spice levels here) but good food nonetheless.Lovely service. If you are with children this comes in very handy.The Thai Desert buffet is lovely for its variety and presentation. A nice place to take out of town friends to for a quick taste of Thailand.Not very pricey for the location and food
4
We went there with our friends and ordered many dishes most of them were awesome.Must try - Tom Yom Sea food soup, Mango Salad, Steamed fish, Thai Green Curry and Oliver Rice.Cocktail -Mekong river. Other cocktails are average.The ambience is great, but the service is cold, however the great tasting food makes up for it.I must say it is a bit overpriced, however it is the best ever Thai food that I had in recent times
1
I am now writing from the restaurant itself. Dishes are normal and not tasty. Pineapple rice does not come in typical pineapple husk. Taste is bad. Tom Yum Goong is not good. Vegetable dish is not good. Other dishes too. Totally not worth coming ! And I brought an overseas guest.
3
We ordered 1. Thai fish cake ( good)2. Pandan chicken ( good)3. Green curry ( pork) ( average)4. Tom Yam Seafood (good)5. Olive rice ( average)6. Crab Omelette ( tasty but oily)7. Mango salad ( good)8. Mango with sticky rice (not up to standard as the mango was flat, tasteless , just a lump of yellow orange fruit)9. Tapioca in syrup ( good) Service by the staff was good in general. I would not go back again due not value for money and an absolutely horrible mango and sticky rice
5
My first visit to this restaurant is based on work-related corporate lunch. During my first visit, the menu was pre-selected but nevertheless, it was satisfying. I've frequented this restaurant for business lunches as well as simply taking relatives out for lunch. This is truly a hidden gem within Amara Hotel, Thanying is no doubt one of the best Thai food I've ever had in Singapore
3
The dessert buffet is the best. The food and service could be better for the price you pay. The place is rather dull, no ambience at all. Rather expensive overall.
4
The restaurant served nice and very authentic thai food. Our favorite is the Thai Mango Salad and Pandan Chicken. The lemongrass drink is also good. Those who has a sweet-tooth can try the dessert buffet.
4
delicious red curry beef, pomelo salad. green curry chicken, spicy tofu, stuffed wings also quite good.
too much AC, very cold!
good for a biz lunch.
4
We had a new year dinner there, it was a set menu for 6 people.
It was very good. We did add an extra dish to give us more choices. The place was full. Overall very good.
5
This was our third visit to this particular restaurant as Thai food is one of our favored cuisine. No visit has been disappointing. The food is always great. We love the steamed fish which is perfectly done here. On this particular visit, the service was exceptional probably due to us being among the early diners there. This would probably be one place I would continue going to on any visits to Singapore
5
Not gonna lie, service and atmosphere here does feel a bit cold, but after living in Singapore for a couple years you get used to it. The food makes up for all of it. Every single dish tastes of Thailand. At of course, triple the price. Another thing you get used to in Singapore. If you have the means and the craving for legit Thai - this is the place.Must haves are the Tom Kah Goong, Mango Salad, whole fish and any of the curries
4
I travel to Singapore about once a year and like Hong Kong, I enjoy the variety of good food here.I usually stop off at Thanying for one dish - the Pad Thai. I know, it's the one dish that seems to define Thai food - or at least the only dish people know when talking about Thai food. But that said, if it is good, why not? The Pad thai here is classically prepared with very fresh shrimp, perfectly cooked noodles, a nice blend of peanut with bean sprouts. On the side you are offered a spicy chili sauce if you are looking to take the dish up a notch or two. I had an amazing appetizer - fried corn cakes that came with a cucumber sauce. Also tried rice cakes that had a tuna sauce of sorts that you put on top to bring some flavor to the cakes. It was good but nothing as tasty as the fried corn cakes.The wine list is good - had a white burgundy from France. I like to know the year of the wine I'm drinking and the village it is from. That wasn't to be found on the wine list.I do get a chuckle when I read the menu - it describes the cuisine as "Royal" Thai. I guess that means the food is fit for a king. Actually, it is
4
Decided to return and visit this decade old restaurant during the Chinese New Year festive and not disappointed. "Yusheng" Thai style was both sweet and spicy, nicely differentiated. The standards of the remaining more commonly known Thai dishes we ordered such as pandan chicken, green curry, prawns stir fried with Thail basil were nicely maintained. Only the deep fried fish was overdone. Having visited Thailand not too long ago, I must say the it's unfair o compare in terms of authenticity (especially the different regional Thai food) and also prices but good Thai food and services in general
2
we had high hopes when coming to this restaurant but it was a very disappointing experience.we had a group of 10 and the service was very poor. they were not attentive at all and didn't know what they were doing and kept mixing up the wines we wanted and pouring the wrong one and the food also didn't taste that great. very basic.the interior of this restaurant also needs revamp badly as its not in the best of condition.definitely not worth it and we will never return. we had a pretty big bill as well and its just not worth it there are so many other great restaurants in Singapore we can go t
5
Thanying has been our family's favourite Thai restaurant in Singapore for well over a decade. Serving royal Thai cuisine, it has an excellent range of vegetarian options and a delectable dessert buffet. The Tanjong Pagar Amara hotel branch has a wider menu than the Sentosa Amara Sanctuary - to get vegetarian food at the Sentosa branch, it's best to call a day in advance. Our usual dishes include the tangy Pomelo Salad with roasted cashew nuts and a drizzle of coconut milk, the Panang Tofu with a thick curry sauce, the Tofu Lard Phrik with deep fried tofu cakes and a spicy-sweet chilli sauce topped with crispy holy basil leaves and the vegetarian Green Curry with sweet potato, potato, Thai eggplant, etc. The dessert buffet has a selection of fresh fruits and thai desserts including 'Khanom Tako' with a jelly and coconut cream layer set in a banana leaf cup, jackfruit pieces with sticky rice, etc. They also serve the standard a la carte thai desserts of mango with sticky rice and Thap Thim Krop, which are always delicious.The ambiance is semi-formal but child-friendly at the same time. It's good for both entertaining and family dinners. Location in Amara hotel is excellent
1
That restaurant food tasted Ok but the bill was certainly not. Fruit juice are not even fresh but from the super market.
4
Great food... service a little overbearing but there was only about 10 people in the restaurant that could sit about 100
4
Atmosphere, decorations, food, service were all delightful
4
When I have guests and want to take for a nice Thai Restaurant, this is the first one I would think of. The hotel is located in Level 2 of Amara hotel near Tanjong Pagar MRT station, along Tanjong Pagar Road. Its chain restaurant in Sentosa Amara Santruary is also very nice. I have been there in both business and private occasions
3
Saturday night, 7.30 pm at Thanying. Around 50% of the tables are occupied and the staff is still able to serve and even to advise you. 30 minutes later, hell broke loose. The automatic ordering system seems to be not working properly; food is brought to a central serving station and stays there for minutes, you can pour your wine yourself, none of the few waiters would find the time. If you can take all that with a sense of humor, you can enjoy a good Thai kitchen (above all when it is still hot when you finally get it).It is a pity – the chef in the kitchen should complain at the management. All the creations we tried were good or very good but the rest is a disaster……

Good Thai food Nice Setting Good Service I recommend it They have sufficient Vegetarian options Mian Kham is a traditional thai dish , which is a very light starter . I had had it when i was in BKK , but never found it in any other Thai restaurant outside Thailand.

Just visited this restaurant (this week) before flying back out of Singapore and got to taste really good Thai food after a very long time. Though our order was mainly vegetarian, there was an exception (the steamed fish, which was wonderfully cooked - almost melted in your mouth, steaming hot and full of flavor). The Som Tam (Raw Green Papaya Salad) was extremely spicy but the Tom Yam (soup) had very subtle flavors in spite of being spicy. We opted for mildly spiced choices for main course, including a Veg Thai Fried Rice and Phad Thai noodles vegetarian, besides fried beancurd in a thick gravy. Found them to be appropriately flavored/ fragrant. We finished the meal with couple of good desserts - water chestnut in coconut milk and sticky rice pudding with mango slices. Both were really good, especially the water chestnut in coconut milk.Personally, had no issues with service, rather found them to be very proactive. I was with my family (two small kids) and the moment we walked in, they were prompt enough to provide with infant and child high-chairs besides trying their best to keep our kids occupied while we enjoyed our meal. We did not have to wait for orders and not even for a moment was the table left unattended - they were quick enough to even refill empty water glasses and mineral water bottles. All in all a great experience though it comes at quite an expense

Although I enjoyed my lunch at Thanying, there was nothing that distinguished it from a hundred other Thai restaurants that I've visited over the years. The menu offers all the familiar items and very little that's new or different. Having said all that, I enjoyed what I ordered - the steamed sea bass was light and full of flavor and the green curry with chicken was spicy and satisfying. Service was pleasant, though it took quite some time for the main courses to be delivered.I can't imagine that I'll go back. Average Thai food at lower prices is easily available elsewhere

Must try includes the stuffed chicken wings - good texture and juicy. ordered pineapple rice and olive rice - really fragrant. love the fried fish too - so crispy that you can eat the bones! lemon grass drink is a little bland but overall food quality is super! Waiter service is appropriate - know when to come in amd when to leave us alone. Certainly great place

Had a business lunch today at this Thai restaurant that has been in Amara Hotel for literally decades or a decade and a half. Food is definitely tasty in the order of Thai basics like the tomyum soup, leaf wrapped fried chicken, fried rice (as advised by captain), green curry and the sour fish. My apologies if I have not given the exact names but these descriptions will get you there. Overall service was fast and good, atmosphere was conducive for a biz discussion but I could not place a number on value because I did not pick up the tab but I would imagine the price point to be at least S$20.00 per head. The dessert was in the form of a buffett and it was laid out near the entrance. Looked and smelled great but that is the standard of Thai dessert. Mighty sweet and fragrant coconut milk as der rigeur. I will definitely be back for a reciprocal appointmet
