We were in Changi Village after a game of golf for lunch and chanced upon this place. Having visited Malacca before Christmas we were excited to see a shop selling chendol. What actually puzzled me to the shop was a sign saying Malacca curry puff. We never saw any curry puff when we were in Malacca nor were there any recommendation when we searched for places to eat in Malacca. Here you have to buy minimum 2, to go. The chendol was reasonably priced at $1.50 for traditional and $1.80 for the red bean chendol. There are other variety. We were so disappointed! Where is the gula melaka taste? All we tasted was coconut. The red bean was good but the server scrapped the last bit from the container and i barely had any. he then took out a new container full to serve the next customer. Is that fair? Over-rated and one can get better ones elsewhere in hawker centers. I did see a recommendation pasted on a wall but cannot remember from which party. Only if one has been to Malacca and eaten chendol. The gula melaka served is a big scope of thick concentrate. Here its like water when the server scoped from the tin to the bowl. One cannot even smell the gula melaka odor

Coconut, Gula Melaka and Pandan leaves make up this simple dish and its fantastic. This stall in Changi Village has been a mainstay and one of the main reasons for taking the 20-30 minute journey to this out of the way location for a meal. The chendol refers to the greenish pasta like things seen in the photos and is mostly the difference between a good bowl of Chendol and a run of the mill version. Most stallholders now use ready made Chendol which is easy to differentiate from their transparent jellyish appearance to the rubber like texture and super sweet taste. It just doesn't taste as good. The real chendol is painstakingly made daily due to limited shelf life and has to be boiled, sifted, pressed countless times for the right texture and fragrance to appear. The version I enjoy most in Singapore is this version in Changi as of writing this on 30th October 2016. It has the right balance of coconut, gula melaka and chendol that makes it not too heavy and always refreshing. Its also a tad salty which works to its benefit. I've also tried a couple of other versions in Penang, Melaka and other parts of Malaysia which i'll share next round. If you're in Singapore and enjoy a good bowl of dessert made traditionally, give this a try. You might be pleasantly surprised

Traditional cendol topped with gula melaka sweet syrup, coconut milk and shaved ice. You can enjoy it with variety of additional toppings: red bean, durian paste, corn or glutinous rice! The sweet cendol simply melt in your mouth and it's a heavenly feeling. Great dessert for hot weather!

Nothing is greater than having a chendol on this hot sunny weather. The server was friendly and made funny jokes. Went to this place with my boyfriend 2 years ago and the quality and service is improving now after we are back from overseas.. Now they had lots of choices of toppings. But we simply love the original chendol! They have other outlet too and one of them is in Jurong which is nearby my house rather than going to Changi!

Only ordered with the corn which come out of a can that you can buy from supermarket, as I didn't want too many toppings to conceal the flavour of the acclaimed homemade chendol. May be it was late at night and the tank of the chendol was about a third left, everything seems so diluted and soaky with little taste!There is nothing like the Chendol Melaka at Jalan Tua Kong

With so much rave on the best Chendol in Changi Village recently, I must have a try of it by hook or by crook.The basic version of the Chendol is served without any toppings. Green coconut jelly left a great impression on the first mouthful. It was very soft but not soggy. Gula Melaka and Coconut milk were added, striking a good balance in the sweetness. However, I prefer to have a stronger fragrant and taste from the coconut milk.There are a few variations of Chendol to choose from with toppings like, jelly, red beans or even durian. We had one of our bowls topped with red beans. It looks more interesting that the plain basic version. These red beans are bigger than the usual ones we had in red bean soups and soften.In conclusion, I would not say they are the best chendol or similar to Melaka but they are of the closest taste whereby taste is like Melaka as well as their pricing. In fact Makan Melaka offers a range of Melaka Food which I had yet to try. I dont mind coming back again for them.http://www.umakemehungry.com/2015/02/makan-melaka.htm
