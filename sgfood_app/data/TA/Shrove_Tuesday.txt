The waffle here is crispy. You have a choice of several flavours of home-made gelato to go with the waffles.
Do not miss the rainbow cheese cake!

I was visiting a friend in Toa Payoh Lor 1 and was surprised to find waffle/cafe located under the flat in an old estate. I was in a rush so only managed to order a Long Black which was delightful. Must certainly go back and check out their waffles next time

Although the cafe is located in one of the ground floor shop of the old estate house, this cafe catch passerby attention as it stands out among all other shops with its modern and unique charm. Oh not to forget they serve yummylicious waffle too.. the best waffle in singapore that i've ever eaten. They serve cakes and snacks as well but im more into the waffle that i didnt try other things beside chocolate lava cake. The chocolate lava cake, the chocolate was in a generous serving the moment you slice it, the chocolate rush out like the volcano just exploded! The chocolate lava cake is not too sweet and it suits my liking but i found it the outside is not crispy enough (i love it if it is crispy in the outside soft in the inside and loads of chocolate). Overall i still rate it 7.5/10. The waffle is the BEST 10/10 score! It is crispy in the outside but fluffy and soft in the inside and the gelato ice cream on top of it makes it the most perfect waffle i've ever had in Singapore! Being a waffle freak, this is the best thus far! You will be surprise with the amount of youngster dining in this cafe although it is located in an old housing estate that majority are elderly people. Come and try their waffle and you will agrees with me!! Will surely come back for more waffle..

This is a tiny place tucked away in Toa Payoh. Prices are cafe prices.The waffles are the best! I like crunchy waffles inside and out - this is it! Their gelato is really good too!Hot tea by the pot is a 1-cup pot, but you can ask for hot water to make more cups of tea.Most of the chairs are plastic stools, so if you're going to sit for a few hours, it can get uncomfortable. They do have a meeting room in the back, but it is very popular, so if you want to use it, be sure to get there early.Definitely worth a visit

At Shrove Tuesday we ate a Milo Dinosaur and a spicy ramen Angus minced beef pattie. The Milo Dinosaur waffle was very tasty and also easy to eat, even for young children. The ice cream Flavours are vanilla and chocolate. I preferred the chocolate ice cream as it was not bitter. However, the vanilla ice cream was simply delicious similar to the chocolate one. As for the spicy ramen Angus minced beef pattie, I loved the beef pattie, moist n tasted great, don't really fancy the ramen (instant noodle). Liked the accompaniments of crushed tomato n egg white. For extra, we had the beef pie, puff pastry nicely done but the beef mix was not as tasty. Nice place for a cup of coffee n a piece of cake. Price reasonable!

I arrived 30mins before they closed. Ordered the milo dinosaur waffles. Eh, sedap la sia. Also, service was amazing. Super friendly and helpful in making my choice of waffle and ice cream. Didn't realise that i was 10mins aft closing time when I left. So sorry to hold you guys up! Thankyou so much for the awesome service! Will definitely visit again

Love the waffles here! Very light with a chewy texture and crispy on the outside. It is very different from any other waffle i've tried before. Top it off with the very creamy ice-cream with unique flavours. My favourite flavours are the earl grey and sea salt caramel. Yums
