Reasonably good food and great variety on the menu. I like the green tea too. Pity the entrance is away from the main aisle in the mall. Restaurant need to be more visible for better customer flow.

Some ok things but overall very average food- with amazingly small plates it is also not particularly good value

Decent quality, better that sakae sushi and I think only slightly cheaper than sushi tei. Had the donburi which was fresh and quite plentiful. Unagi on rice was not to bad either. Will come back again, probably the only decent jap restaurant in the area

We were looking for a new place for dinner and saw the banner for Issho Izakaya. Due to its location, it is more accessible from the exterior of the building. It was a great choice for a wonderful Jap dinner. We ordered the popular salmon salad, bara chirashi don, California maki and the grilled fish. Loved the green tea. Found the Bara chirashi don full of chunky sashimi chunk assortment over Jap rice. This was nice and fresh and especially great for sashimi lovers. The grilled fish had a chewy texture while the salmon salad had 3 rolls of salmon sashimi. A nice place to relax with friends over a meal.

Our large group of 25 people were easily accommodated by Issho.Though the place is not large, the tables can be configured to seat from 2 to 14 or even more.I found the food offerings wide as shown by its nicely designed menu. Plenty of photos to select from, so it is friendly even for first timers to Japanese cuisine.Since it is an izakaya, this resto is specially for drinking - beer, wine, sake. So a perfect start to our dinner was a good mug of draught beer. Small mug though. At this point, you should order a serving of edamame (boiled and salted green soybean) to go with the beer.We had numerous orders. I can recommend the ff:1) Salad with Japanese sesame dressing2) sushi platter (15 pieces of rolls - mix of tuna, salmon, ika, California maki, egg roll and unagi)3) Tsukune yaki (chicken meatball)4) tebasaki (grilled chicken wing)5) tonkatsu (deep fried breaded kurobuta pork cutlet)6) skewered egg roll in special sauce7) gyuudon-style pork slices with gingerFor me, the best items were the sushi and pork slices in ginger and sesame seed. Perfect with a side order of white rice and miso soup.We ended our meal with a dessert of taiyaki, which is a fish-shaped "cake" with red bean paste and ice cream inside.Our dinner was made perfect due to good service and awesome food. I will definitely be back

This is a reasonably priced local restaurant serving a wide selection of tasty Japanese sushi, sashimi etc.We had a pleasant family lunch with the kids enjoying their meals. The menu is pretty comprehensive, the service is minimal and the quality is OK without being exceptional. Nothing to write home about but nevertheless nothing much to complain about either

Was here for lunch. Terribly inflexible. I ordered two kids meals. I wanted to swap the cold soba in the set meal for hot udon as my kids would prefer hot food. It was impossible to change despite being the same price. I asked them to pour hot soup onto the soba and was rejected too. Ordered a beef kaminabe for 22 dollars and it doesn't come with rice. Ordered a bowl of rice and they charged us 3 dollars for rice.Charged us 1 dollar each for tap water. Money hungry establishment

Happened upon this restaurant while walking in Kallang Wave and decided to give it a go for dinner. Relatively small restaurant with not much Japanese flair in its' decoration. Service was okay but nothing outstanding. We ordered a selection of sushi and a bottle of red wine. The food was very average and nothing fancy.However the bill went came was a bit of a shock at $306.We won't mind paying those high prices if we thought the food and service was really good but the whole dinning experience was very average. Certainly not worth the price we paid for. So many other choices to eat while in Singapore that we are certain we won't return to this place again.

I like going to Singapore Sport Hub and Kallang Wave in particular. The 3 of us got here taking the Circle line after we went to Comex at Suntec. One of my reason for visiting is to try the food. We had ramen and pork hot pot and side dishes (deep fried fish fin and cheek are quite good). Service was okay. We went without a reservation so we had to finished our dinner quickly as the place is fully booked on this Saturday. The prices are acceptable considering that this is a Japanese restaurant. Good Japanese restaurants are quite expensive in Singapore
