Came here with colleagues for Lunch. The set meal we had was at $20 nett per pax.The decoration of this place is nice. And the place seems to hire people with special needs to work here. The staff is generally polite and smiley though they could be a little anxious.Overall it was a good experience. And I hope there is more support to this place

My friend invited me for a quick lunch before I catch a coach back to Kuala Lumpur. It is a small restaurant but very clean, quite and comfortable.We had a set lunch at S$20.00 with starter of soup, then come the main course and finished with dessert and coffee or tea. The portion is not too big. Just good enough for a simple lunch.We had a good time here catching up after last seen each other 39 years ago...

When I first met the mother of Joan Bowen I was impressed by her love caring for her daughter and the many young adults she's given a place to call home at work.it was 2015Dec where I was there for a food tasting for our corporate event and ignoring the why's or how's the food is excellent, a 5 star experience !While the people serving you look perfectly normal, there's a special someone in all of them that you will figure out and if or when you do it makes it all the more touching to see them at work and making a go at living life :)If you ever drop by this cafÃ©, take a cab as parking is almost impossible... sit down and have a chat with them to learn why this is just a special place for you to enjoy an afternoon break.... note that many corporate bookings are made and their ability to cater what they buy fresh to cook is such a joy<Be Patient and Tolerant, these folks took a long time to learn how to run a great restaurant & please not photo taking of their staff, they are special people
