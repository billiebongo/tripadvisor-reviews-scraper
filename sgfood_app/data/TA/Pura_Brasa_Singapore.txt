I like the meal. It is a spanish inspired meal.
I love how they cooked the pork ribs (good for sharing as well)
Also the steak deliciously made.
The veggies were fresh. My favorite is the asparagus

Went for lunch and it was average. The staff are not very friendly and there were items missing from the menu.

Visit for dinner on Sunday night. Beer promotion before 7pm was good value. Best dishes are the pork belly (although it wasps sinfully fatty) and pork ribs. Some of the rice dishes were also yummy. Will probably visit again.

About 8 months old, it enjoys good patronage, thanks to its generally nice food, service and ambience.
The pork ribs are delectable but its signature seafood paella was lacking in oomph.
Very accessible as it is located close to the Tanjong Pagar train station.

The atmosphere looked authentic and hearing that this is from spain. I gladly came to try. However i did not se a lot tapas choices. I remembered the beef main course was probably the best. The rest were forgetable

Came here based on numerous recommendations from friends. Was not disappointed at all. The smoky flavour from the josper grill really brought out the best of the food. In particular the paella and aubergine were flavorful and addictive. Pork ribs and steak was good but I've had better cuts of meat, though for the price this was respectable. Will be back again

An establishment that boasts of some good Spanish cuisine. Think this is the only branch in Asia with many in Barcelona.Went there twice in the last month - with family & with friends for dinner on different occasions, and had a pleasant time. Great ambience & would say the food quality and service were consistent and good both times. The only small surprise was the paella, which was very good & moist, but had mussels one time & shrimp another... Made it interesting though!The churros, roasted pig leg, & paella are must try dishes. Their cava is also decently priced. Do reserve ahead of time as they do get busy, especially on a Friday night

Our dinner gathering started off well until the long wait of almost an hour for the ribs to be served. When we checked with the staff the first time, we were told to wait another 4-5 mins. A while later, even the table behind us who came in later was served their ribs, but ours were still nowhere to be seen. Then we checked with the staff again who was seen consulting another senior staff while looking perplexed. That said staff didn't follow up with us on the ribs status accordingly so we had to check with them for the third time. Another 5 mins, we were told. That was the last straw! After which, we only got some lame excuse for the (huge) delay, some apologies and a bowl of potato tapas to fill the gap without asking us if we were fine with that recovery dish. We rejected the tapas. After paying the bill in full, we asked the staff about service recovery and they offered us desserts and coffee/tea. Mind you, we were already having desserts (which we paid for) at that point of time! How much more desserts did they want us to have at 10:30pm?! We declined the additional desserts and hot beverages. And that was it. No further recovery. A very weak and passive attempt in service recovery. Food was not bad but such outrageous service would deter us from going to Pura Brasa again. Â¡Que terrible

This restaurant has so much going for it - a good, new location with convenient transport links, a modern cheery bright dining area and an exciting menu. So why then would they throw it all away and serve food literally dripping in oil. Whilst I had a reasonable paella, fortified by MSG I believe, my partner ordered a dish of cod served on a bed of diced vegetables. These vegetables were doused in cooking oil rendering the whole dish unpalatable. To be fair, the manager exchanged the dish agreeing that the oil was excessive and discounted the meal from the bill.Sadly, though, the replacement cod dish was almost just as oily and was ultimately left uneaten.Somewhat typically for Singapore, what looks at the outset to be an exciting venue is held hostage by poor execution and a kitchen with little interest in quality.I wouldn't visit agai
