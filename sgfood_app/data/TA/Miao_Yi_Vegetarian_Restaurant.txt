Restaurant is nestled amongst a long row of other eateries. We chose it as we’re looking just for vegetarian meal. The interior decor is simple and functional. Staff is very attentive. Food is very delicious. Herbal soup has generous portions of herbs.
5
Came here a few times. I must say the food is good and tasty. Nice vege food with quite a lot of variety. We liked the assam fish and claypot tofu. As I said, its a little pricey. We paid about $50 for two persons.

Didn't know had moved. Finally got there. Food not particularly tasty. Charged for items served but not ordered. Bill was adjusted when we complained.
5
Their new location is at the People Park Centre which is more central and convenient to go. Their food is still good and price wise is affordable. The service staffs are great too. A good place to bring your guest to if they are vegetarian.

Somewhat hard to find. Located on floor 3 at the People Park’s shopping center. Very good selection of vegetarian dishes including mock fish and mock meat dishes. The visitors to the restaurant were groups of families and friends. I couldn’t see any tourists. The “dragon of excellence” mock fish tasted excellent. Mock fish, white rice, Chinese tea and the dessert mango pudding costed 22SGD. I wholeheartedly recommend this place and would like to visit again

It has shifted to Chinatown, and the place is now larger and more spacious. Although reservation is available, I was able to grab a convenient seat for my family without reservation.There are many great vegetarian dishes, enough to entice meat eaters to stay vegetarian and happy with the quality of food too

Made advance reservation for a big table of 12 adults + 2 baby chairs.When we arrived, baby chairs nowhere ready and we had to find them ourselves.Lousy service. We had to wave and call out the waitresses but were ignored. In the end we had to walk to the counter to place the order. Food took ages to come. We had to ask many times when the next dish will be served. One dish was left out totally forgotten! So we decided to cancel it as we spent too long in waiting. Overheard 2 other tables commenting that they cancelled some of their orders as well as they took too long to serve!Food was acceptable but not worth to go due to the bad slow service and we had to pay service charge for a lousy service? Bad experience

First of all, the restaurant has shifted to People's Centre. So the address shown is incorrect. The food was tasty, and could have been more spicy! But that's my individual preference. I had a cursory look at the dessert options; and there were not very many. Worth a visit.
4
Orignally at Bukit Timah road, but now has moved to People's Park Centre, 3rd floor. Bigger place. Good layout seating. Service staff polite and helpful. Prices reasonable. Excellent place for authentic Chinese vegetarian food, or rather mock food.
5
This is an excellent place for vegetarian food! Mock Curry fish head, tofu etc. The must try dish is the attached photo. Forgot what's the name of the dish.
4
One of the best vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. I like many of their dishes... Good value for money too. Service is ok too.
4
Must try their BBQ fish ! Sauté spicy Kang Kong , Mock curry fish head, Fragrant Buddha Bowl.
Their address has changed to :
People's Park Centre
#03-32
101 Upper Cross Street
Singapore 058357

Nice food!
Restaurant has been around ages! Coronation Plaza is between botanic gardens MRT and Tan Kah Kee MRT so depending on which line you take. Else, plenty of buses at bus stop outside
5
I was told this shop is one of 3 earliest vegetarian eateries in singapore, very old school, ask the staffs to suggest handmade dishes.
3
My family used to eat in this restaurant especially for old folks' birthday occasions. The place is assessible with MRT directly to the building (People's Park Centre) door step. Ample parking but parking can be very expensive. I parked for 1 hour 30 mins around 12pm to 1.30pm, the fee is $6.44.... Food is OK, some is super nice but some can be very bad. The "Asam claypot fish" is a total failure. But the sweet and sour veg "pork ribs" is awesome. So it really depends on your ordering.....Some other good dishes are veg "Suckling Pigs", wrap with lettuce. The portion is big so you need at least 4 pax to order this dish.The veg "Oyster" (actually it is mushrooms) is a MUST for me to order each time when I visit the restaurant.Go test and trial the food yourself.....Good luck in your ordering ....

My family has been eating at this restaurant at Coronation Plaza regularly for more than 25 years. Sometime earlier this year we were lucky to catch them on their last day at their Coronation Plaza location. They are now located at People's Park Centre #03-02 101 Upper Cross Street, Singapore 058357.The new place is bigger, therefore more spacious. The quality of food is still as good as ever. And the amazing service staff still have the same pleasant patient attitude. Prices are still the same also

First time i ate in this restaurant & i enjoyed every bit of it in its new location in People's Park, Chinatown. Service was impeccable - the ladies were prompt & polite. Every dish was amazing, stunning & very delicious. I couldnt believe my eyes to see close resemblances of these mock vegetarian ingredients looking like meat dishes especially the cold starters of 6 items, shark fin soup, fish, beijing duck, char siu, abalone, etc. Not only the taste was excellent, the texture was fantastic & the look was a feast to the eyes. Ambience was grandeur, wide & spacious. Kudos to the waitrons & kitchen team, there's no flaw at all.
5
By far the best vegetarian food you can get. Located in a small mall and have been here for decades. Traditional Chinese vegetarian food with some local inspired dishes such as Assam 'fish'. Dishes you NEED to eat, Suckling pig, fried oysters, olive rice and finish off with yam paste for dessert.
4
We found by chance this small, hidden restaurant at third floor of Coronation Shopping Center. Vegetarian and vegan Chinese cuisine, food is excellent from starters to dessert. Service is very accurate. No alcoholic beverages are served, on the other hand tea is for free. About SGD 40 per person for a complete dinner, I recommend you to try it
5
Tucked away near the corner of 3rd floor of Coronation Plaza is this hidden gem of a vegetarian restaurant. Food quality is good, service is nice and for the serving size and quality, the prices are definitely more value for money than places like Lingzhi Restaurant. Our favorite dishes are the stir fry brocolli, yam ring (not on menu, but can request for it) , Kung Bao Monkey Head mushroom (can ask for less spicy). TIPS: 1. It's surprisingly crowded on weekend evenings. Do make your reservation early! 2. Don't like gluten? Ask the waitress to recommend non-gluten based dishes (eg mock duck, mock fish) and go for the vegetable and mushroom dishes. Eg the mock oyster dish is made of mushrooms!Nutritious!
5
Have been going to this restaurant for ages, especially for special occasions like Chinese New Year or to celebrate a happy occasion. The food quality is consistently delicious and well presented. The waitresses are always warm, friendly and very attentive. The restaurant setting may not be grand but its clean. Remember to make reservations, even on weekdays
5
Tucked away on the 3rd floor of Coronation Plaza is a fabulous place for vegetarian food. I love it cos (1) Variety - lots of it. Even mock fish and meat which tastes quite real . of cos try to avoid too much of this stuff. It's mostly gluten.(2) Pricing. Dishes are around $8 to $20 depending on the size of the dish, which I consider very reasonable compared with outfits like LingZhi (run by Tung Lok Group). (3) Taste - Of cos! The broccoli, hairy monkey head mushrooms, signature tofu were fabulous. very innovative. (4) Service - surprisingly not bad! Prompt in serving us tea and the food. Suggestions for improvement: More mushroom dishes please. TIPS: (1) go slightly earlier. (2) Try to make a reservation if you can. Gets really crowded fast, even on a weekday evening
5
I have always ordered their stir-fry kangkong and sweet potato leaves, mock suckling pig, dumplings, egg dumplings with spinach, cold platter, olive fried rice, sweet and sour spare rib, hot plate tofu and yam paste/ almond tofu for dessert. Their taste is distinct and special which I have not tasted in other vegetarian restaurants before which is the reason why I make it a must to order their food for CNY and other special occasions. Only con is they are located very far and very noisy when its crowde
5
We were delighted to find that since our first visit in late 1980's, this restaurant has continued to offer a wide choice of quality modest cost vegetarian food that even non-vegetarians find compelling! If you are near Coronation Plaza, it is worth making the effort to visit this restaurant for lunch or dinner, and get an authentic Singapore experience

Visited Miao Yi for lunch with colleagues. It's got an extensive menu, well categorised, and with lots of pictures! We got a few different things to share: Dumplings, BBQ Chicken, Olive Rice, and a Tofu-Mushroom dish that was called something Dragon. The dumplings were delicious - light and satisfying. The Dragon has wonderfully done Mushrooms. The BBQ chicken came with a yummy Peanut Sauce that was worth downing in spoonfuls.There was also a free flow of warm Chinese tea, which worked as an appetizer of sorts through the meal! We got a Mango Pudding as dessert and that was very average - almost like packaged Mango Jelly.In all, the food was interesting - most dishes were tasty and well made. Worth a repeat visit

Usually when it comes to vegetarian, there is always the stereotype and fear that it may not be so good. This restaurant is where you will be surprised. Not only is the food actually very tasty, there were a lot of effort put into the simple dish to mimic real meat, fish etc. At the first look, you will probably be deceived that it is the real thing. I was there lunch with friends and there wasn't a big crowd, but the food were good and it kept coming without much delay. The staff were helpful and often helped serve or top up the tea etc. Service wise there is nothing to complain about.The food were very ingenious and if you had not tried vegetarian, especially the Chinese style, this is one of the few great place to experience it in Singapore. There are a huge variety of food and so far I had tried, none I would even call it bad. All of them were good and tasty. I had a really enjoyable lunch here.Would recommend coming here to try out, but it is not a very cheap to be outfront. There are also set menu running at SGD$250 onwards for a table of 10 too
5
Still thinking about the food after the recent visit, it's deliciously good! The ginger rice goes well with the fried fish with mushroom and sweet & sour pork. Our kids loved the wanton and fried shrimps with mayonnaise. The red bean pancake was a satisfying dessert. Weekend lunch should be safe for walk in
5
My all-time personal favourite. A must-go for all my special occassions such as birthday, anniversaries, etc. Always perks me up after dining here. Service is great and the dishes are super delicious. Some of my personal favourite dishes are mock piglet (their specialty! Must try even if it costs sgd30+!), stir fried kangkong, sambal sweet potato leaves, curry fish head, sweet and sour fish and yam paste dessert. Actually, I like almost all their dishes!!! Must make reservation for weekends and public holiday to avoid disappointment
5
One of the best chinese veg dining visited so far.Must try Soya Satay with peanut sauce. I love the sizzlers and olive fried rice. Its quite well organized and good service. Its not too expensive and price is quite reasonable.
4
It is hidden gem. It happened to visit this restuarant last week. We love their hospitality and food. You must try mock chicken Satay and Olive fried rice.
4
One would assume that vegetarian food are bland & boring , but this place certainly proves my perception wrong. They had amazing curry , mock meat dishes and all taste divine and healthy . Will most certainly return !
5
Great vegetarian Chinese restaurant-style food. Service is also very good.
4
it has been quite a good few years since i last visited it and it did not disappoint. open since 1988 or so, a painting on the wall says, this chinese vegetarian is still one of the best around. Recommendations:- vege fish or mutton curry, the "luo rou" or snail meat is really good. the snail meat made from oyster mushroom is so tender. just great. lastly, the vege roasted meat is really really good. just like the real thing. you wrap the meat with lettuce plus cucumber and their sauce. yummy yumm
5
We came one night and then returned the next day, because we loved the food so much. Being a vegetarian, the food at Miao Yi must have one of the best experiences of Chinese dining I have ever had. Everything we ordered was delicious. I agree with other reviewers that the Olive fried rice is particularly good
4
A very old school place to have a vegetarian meal. Do make a booking for weekend meals as they do get really crowded.Olive fried rice was great! Claypot Beancurd Assorted was good too. Guess you can just order those food with the "thumbs up" in the menu or just stick to their speciality food
4
While I write a review today, Miao Yi has been a regularly visited haunt for a few years now with a visit warranted at least once a month. Its got a wide variety of dishes and the consistency of service and food quality is what keeps people coming back. I should warn that the restaurant has its strong set of regulars - it never fails to amuse me on how its almost guaranteed to hear a birthday song if you are visiting them on weekends and also notice on the number of tables you will see 3 generations (and sometimes more!) sitting together on the same table. Tip: If you see yourself coming back, get a member's card made, gets you 10% off on the food bill

Off the main tourist drags, Miao Yi is not to be missed.Strictly a veggie restaurant, Miao Yi specializes in serving veggies dishes that look, smell, and most impressively, taste like meat dishes. Yes, really!I went last night with a party of 5 and, served family style, we had Pork BBQ ribs, sharkfin soup, cod fish with veggies, sweet and sour pork, and my favorite, mutton curry. Of course none of these meals had pork, sharkfin, cod, or mutton at all. It really was quite impressive how they made the textures so authentic. The mock cod even had skin on it.As others have said, this restaurant is on the 3rd floor of Coronation Plaza so don't expect to be surrounded by the arts and croissant crowd and, of course, there is no view at all. The restaurant is small and with the exception being the food, it is unspectacular. The restaurant was mostly filled with local families. There was also a table of buddist nuns enjoying plates full of mock-meat. I wonder if this is a guilty pleasure for them.The only disappointment of the evening was the mango pudding dessert. I would recommend you avoid it and opt for one of the other desserts none of which I tried but were enjoyed by my friends. The disappointment with the dessert was quickly tempered when the bill came. Miao Yi is very affordable.I suppose I should end the review by pointing out that I am a Texican and most decidedly a meat eater

At first, I did not believe that there could be a good restaurant on the 3rd floor of Coronation Plaza. It appears to be an odd location as this is not a typical restaurant mall spot Don't let the location fool you, the food here is GREAT!!We keep going back for the delicious vegetarian food. Our favorites are mock suckling pick (mock meat), sharkfin soup, dumplings and chinese vegetables. The atmosphere is quite simple so don't expect much in that area. Come for the food. If you are in the Bukit Timah road area, it's worth a visit. TIP: Street address is 587 Bukit Timah Road in Coronation Plaza to find on your GPS. It's on the 3rd floor with the exact numbering as #03-01/02
