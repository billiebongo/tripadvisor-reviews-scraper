For a hawker centre standard, this is consider ok.
Prices are very reasonable.
If you happen to be at East Coast, drop by and try.

Braised duck, savory, flavourful, dark sauce is good, goes very well with porridge. One of the better braised ducks on the island. Long queue, would not mind queueing up again

Despite the line that might say otherwise, I didn't have any luck with this place and wasn't all that impressed with the duck or the sauce that it came with. I personally wouldn't line up for it again.
