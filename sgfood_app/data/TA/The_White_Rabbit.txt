We went here for a family dinner, and order Lobster bisque as appetizer, Pork Chop and another 2 Pastas as main meals. They are all taste delicious, and well served. The dessert (chocolate with ice cream) was also excellent. Ambience is nice and services are good and efficient. Pricing is considered high but may be justified by quality of the foods, ambience and services provided. Itâ€™s definitely a good place to have nice meals in Singapore.

We went there for Valentine's day. As usual, the food was meticulously prepared. Service again very friendly and accomodating. Given the price of 118 S$ I had expected perhaps some bigger portions or an extra dis
4
Nice place, good food for a brunch: Eggs Benedict, Bacon Bourbon Waffles, Wagyu burger ... are very good. Choice of dessert is a little bit short
5
Service was excellent. Meat was cooked well and variety wise wish there will be more but nevertheless the visit was excellent
4
We had set lunch in a romantic setting. After meal, we explore the outdoor garden of the restuarant. Thank you to all the staff who made our advance V Day celebration a memorable one
5
Great ambience and fine dining experience. Great for couples. Very highly recommended for special occasions.
5
Nice ambient,good seating, excellent food, service. Wanted to try the burrata but ran out. So for sure will come back!!!!!

Located in its own site and housed in the historic Ebenezar chapel, the restaurant has it own magic charm. Its high ceiling ensures that you still have your own conversation space even when the restaurant is packed. The dining experience is enhanced by the impeccable service from every waiter, waitress and server. No details are too small to miss. In fact, many restaurants who price themselves at a much higher cost bracket have inferior service standards.For starters, we had lobster bisque and trout tartare. For mains, we had iberian pork chop and wagyu steam (medium). Dessert we shared the chocolate tart. The meat were done perfectly. Juicy,tender and bursting with flavour. Serving size were reasonable. For the price we paid, its definitely worth a repeat visit for special occasions.

The website generates such expectations - that's why we went there. The food was pretty good, but not startling. The service is efficient, but boarding on frosty. It is quite a schlepp to get there. The converted chapel is loud and echoey - not the place to linger over a meal. I also hate the fact that they overkill the whole chapel aspect. They have retained the old services board outside the building, but instead of 'Praise be the lord' they have 'Praise be the lard'. I am not a Christian but I hate vulgarity. I wouldn't run back here
5
Had dinner with family here. Although price is bit on the steep side, service was great. Could see the meticulous effort put in for the dishes. Likely to visit again on another special occasion
5
Both the food and services were good. They even decorated the dessert and took a photo, printed it out for us as it was my girlfriend's birthday.
5
Had brunch here and the Wild Mushroom Scrambled Egg was to die for. Eggs Benedict was pretty good too. Quiet and a very soothing ambience. Worth the try.
3
Great place to be honest! the service was great! its just that we were not use to the type of food being serve
5
Its was an excellent service provided and food very good as expected! Restaurant took picture of us and gave us as moment
5
This was my first trip to White Rabbit for lunch. We had the set lunch which gave several options for starters and mains. The service is equal to the professional, elegant one comes to expect during dinner. The atmosphere is quiet so it’s easy to enjoy your conversation as well as your meal.
5
Interior is very beautiful since the building was a church in the past. We prefer sofa seat so we will ask to reserve the sofa for 2 - 4 pax.
2
Ordered the Charcuterie platter, cheese platter, salad and the white rabbit fry up. All super bad (eg not value for money) and all we did not finish. Paid $60 per person including drinks. We told the manager that the salad was super mediocre for something that is recommended and he said that “Asians usually don’t opt for it because it doesn’t suit the Asian taste.” Are you kidding me? Did not even offer to change up the dish for something else.Will never go back. Disappointing, really
5
Nice setting preps up for a great dining experience. Surrounded by greeneries and peaceful environment. Food was a bliss with the lobster bisque and steak was better than some of the more popular steak houses in town
2
Booked for 8:45 pm and already much off the menu.Food quality was satisfactory, good starters (lobster bisque and sea trout carpaccio).Staff inattentive - perhaps distracted by their secret service ear pieces! Why?Ambience: clattery and cafeteria-like
5
As always, we warmly greeted at the front door and shown to our table. Wanted to try something new and was given a good description of the dish I wanted. Excellent service as always.
5
Went for a birthday celebration and the service staff listened and carried out my special requests. Staff also offered to take a picture of us and print it out instantly as a souvenir. Great service and food and will definitely go back again.
5
Lobster Sandwich and carbonara is very nice. The service and atmosphere also very nice. Loving it here
5
Very good to have the lunch here with my friends from Japan. They seemed delighted and enjoyed the meal
5
Loved the atmosphere! Loved the food..we had the 4 course tasting menu and felt that the quantity could be been a tad bit more, other than that great! The service was excellent â€˜
5
We visited the restaurant last month. It was one of the restaurants that we are excited to visit in Singapore because of its great ambiance and great photos online.They have an extensive menu to choose from. We enjoyed everything that we ordered especially the wagyu carpaccio (A MASTERPIECE!). Make sure to order that!The restaurant is very picturesque even though they have a little too dark lighting. They also have a beautiful garden just outside the restaurant which features their huge selection of gin.You can really feel the holiday season here because they were full when we visited. Luckily we made a reservation. The service staff was very attentive and efficient. They greeted us warmly upon arrival and seated us on one of their semi-circle sofa seats (yes!!!). We were attended by Anne. She gave us recommendations on the food. She sounds really convincing so we decided to order what she recommended... AND SHE WAS RIGHT!!!! One thing that we noticed is that she is very alert and observant, without us asking for it, she already knows what we want/need. Kudos to her and the rest of the staff for making our dinner memorable.It was really a wonderful dining experience for us, from start to the end of our dinner.We will recommend this place to our friends visiting Singapore.What we ordered:(Wagyu carpaccio, endive salad, king crab tagliatelle, grilled pork chop.. and of course the dessert.. chocolate tart
4
Was invited here for lunch. I must say that I was very impressed with this place. The ambience in great being housed in an old church. Food was great, we had the set lunch. Service was excellent. Will definitely come back.
5
Service was attentive but unobtrusive. Wine list was excellent. Menu, while not as extensive as I would have liked it to be, was varied and interesting
4
The environment and atmosphere here are good, we were enjoyed including the foods. I will recommend to my friend
4
Great food and upscale ambiance. My only critique is that some of the furnishings are run down (lamp shade with rip/tears, seat cushion with tear), which is unexpected for a high-priced dining experience. The food and service was excellent
5
Superb quality foodMenu is a little limited, though it's excellent qualityGreat photo locationLobster bisque was exceptiona
3
A fun setting, in a converted church. The conversion is well done.The food is also good, not stunning, but good. The Beef Carpaccio was excellent but on one of our side dishes, the asparagus tips seemed gritty - making me wonder if the tips had been properly washed.The service is unfortunately poor: despite a computerised wine list (it is on an iPad) we were served a different vintage (younger) to that advertised. This is frustratingly when one has a fondness for aged reds. I understand it can happen when one has printed wine lists and supplies run low, but there is no excuse for it when operating a paperless system.
4
My partner and I had the weekday set lunch. I got to try the vegetable broth (very flavorful!), Oxtail Agnolotti (folded very beautifully, with a thick, tasty oxtail sauce), and a very unique chestnut parfait with mushroom ice cream (the portion was huge!). The food was about average for the price, but what made it worth it for me was the beautiful Ebenezer Chapel. Go there, and you will really feel like you fell down the rabbit hole with Alice into another world :
4
We went with a friend to catch up over brunch. Undoubtedly, White Rabbit is a stunning venue. The Chapel itself, is so charming and the careful decoration is stunning. It is always a pleasure to visit and visually experience this place.The beautiful stained glass windows and garden are gorgeous.The food was not memorable. I donâ€™t really remember anything about it. I ordered a salad and my husband Eggs Benedict
4
Overall a good experience and we like the atmosphere of the restaurant. The food quality is good too.
4
The food and ambience were perfect for a Sunday brunch. Highly recommend the gin and tonics. Service was good too but we were rushed out for cleaning at 3pm, which put a slight damper on things
5
Great ambience, tasty food!I ordered the Grilled Lobster sandwich - meat was succulent & worth the price :
4
It was my first time to the white rabbit and I am impressed with the foods.I had a great experience there. Highly recommended
3
The White Rabbit is housed in an old church and so it is quite quaint. I loved the high ceilings - makes for beautiful pictures.The food is pretty average although the service is attentive .
5
It took a little extra effort in the planning stage, but by far I found the perfect location, place to eat and staff to support my marriage proposal to the only lady in my life. As massive fan of Alice in Wonderland, but not wanting it to be too comic book, this venue gave me the romantic and classy setting in my favorite place Singapore to pop the question. The WR Team supported me from a far in the booking and ensuring that my requests were met in full by phone and email. The service from start to finish was excellent and the little extras make it all the better.The place itself is amazing. The old white colonial churn and stain glass, along with the twinkly lights, give the place a magical feel. The staff set a sense of occasion for you too, which make that good in to a great.I was impressed with the printed photo card given on the night and signed by the team. This was very sweet. The flowers arranged through the WR Team were amazing and just perfect on the night. The food was excellent (may be a little too my truffle, but who can complain about that?). The gin bar was so cool after dinner and the young man serving at the bar was excellent, looking after us with a personal service. It is all about the personal service and experience that sets a restaurant or place like this apart. The elegance and surroundings are perfect for the relaxed fine dinning, so it is important to maintain the standards, please do WR Team so I can consider coming back to actually get married
3
Love the service and ambience. We went for the second seating on 25 dec. Very family friendly and we all loved the spread offered at the appetisers/carving/desserts station. However, we all felt that the mains can be improved. Overall a pleasant experience nevertheless :)
4
The food was really good and the ambience was wonderful. However, they were a little overwhelmed by the number of customers who had made reservation for Xmas dinner so we had to wait 30 mins after our assigned timing before we could get our seat.
4
Lots of lovely options on display. The chefs had risen to the occasion. Queues weren’t too long - we’d booked for the early brunch seating with baby. Beautiful setting in an old church. Lots of staff dashing about so it was surprising we had to ask for water glasses to be replenished. When plates were removed no cutlery or fresh serviettes were replaced. Lucky we ordered cooked main course. The choristers were right beside our table & too loud which totally spoilt the ambiance of what we hoped would be a relaxing meal with family as it was impossible to have a conversation. Would we return? Probably not for the cost. Tables weren’t decorated - it was Christmas Day - sadly they missed the significance of the occasion. The jumping castle outside was right in the sun & way too hot for children - no thought had gone into preparation for a family affair it seemed.
5
Nice food and environment, really enjoyeddd, will visit agian. Btw, my friend gg to have ROM there soon:)
2
Ordered the 4-course lunch which included beef tartare, umami soup, truffle risotto and some strawberry dessert with champagne icecream. All of them tasted really plain, nothing stood out or exceptional I almost feel a usual home cooking would taste far better. The only good thing about this place is a really pretty vibes in the old chapel
4
Food was good with instagrammable presentation. Service was good with attentive staffs. Location is easy to find with free parking.
5
Excellent food although the price could be better. Service was pretty good. Specially the smiles on faces while serving the clients.
5
Good service provided by the staff over at The White Rabbit, it was actually my wife's birthday but i did not request for a cake, so they served an ice cream scoop with birthday wishes!
5
Very nice place with nice service. The food is also tasty and good. But perhaps quite pricey. Overall I’m satisfie
5
The ambience is great.. Food was fantastic.... Overall good...the only down side nothing keep up the good wor
5
We came here to celebrate our anniversary on the recommendations of friends. We were treated to a wonderful meal and great feels. Do try the crepe suzette.
5
Really enjoyed the service provided by the staff there! The ambience and the food was worth the price
5
Beautiful chapel, tasty food well presented on the plates and great service. We really had a good time at the white rabbit.
It is just a bit noisy.
4
It was our first time there for birthday celebration, and we love the ambience. The service is good. Special thanks to the server who took a photo of us and presented it as a good memorial gift for us. We enjoyed the dinner.
5
We love the food and the ambience of the restaurant is perfect for our wedding anniversary romantic dinner.
3
 Good location, nice building. Slow service, argumentative service staff. Set lunch menu service between the starter & main course was 1 hour over gap . Lucky we have had a lot to talk about among diners ! 30mnts delayed 2nd bottle service was rather a put off . Manager had tried to make up for the delay by saying miscommunication which wasn't the case . We are being offered free coffees as a apology gesture . Rather have service on time than damage control . Though it was crowed lunch hours during this festive seasons it's rather essential to receive friendly & efficient service.
4
Love the interior. I appreciate they took the effort to preserve the original look and even minor details. Worth the experience
4
Located in an old converted church, this restaurant has the loveliest stained glass panels. Best thing to order here are their gin concoctions. Indulgence with our lunch. I had the seafood pie, with lobster tail and fresh prawns. My lunch partners had the Sunday roast beef with Yorkshire pudding. For dessert, I recommend the bread and butter pudding and crepe Suzette which is prepared at your table.Reservations are required as this place gets really busy on the weekends
3
Nice ambience, beautiful place. But food options are limited and the place got very noisy when there were more people.
5
As a firm favorite in the Singapore dining landscape, The White Rabbit has so far never ceased to impress through its culinary excellence, outstanding service and ambience of warmth that permeates this stunning building! Every experience has been memorable and pleasurable with this time being no exception.The expressions ‘Drink Me’ and ‘Eat Me’ have never been so relevant!
4
Had an enjoyable dinner here, however the service could have been better. Don’t get me wrong, the server who attended to us wasn’t rude or anything of that sort. She was polite and smiley the whole night. Just that she didn’t really know the wine she was serving, making her look unprofessional, and when we asked for the menu after our meal to look at the dessert, she didn’t come back to us to ask if we have decided. We ended up waiting a long time before someone noticed us. Finally, after we asked for the bill, we were surprised that they gave us a complimentary ice cream with a candle as we were celebrating a birthday. Yet at this point, (another person) the server just placed the dessert and walked away even after my Boyfriend said thank you. I mean, what’s the point of giving us this sweet gesture when you’re not even saying something simple like “happy birthday”? I think it’s only basic for a service provider to do all these. Food was ok but nothing over the top, hence I’ll say this place is overrated
5
Very unique location that suits the Alice in Wonderland concept. Lots of birthday brunch there when I visited. The food was very nice although the prices were also high. The service is on-point and detail-oriented. Would be perfect for a date.
3
Nice ambience, cool location and friendly staff, but especially the set menus are very much overpriced for both the quality and especially the quantity! Over 500 dollars for 2 people is not worth it
4
Was there for a birthday celebration with two of my beat friends. The place was lovely but was a little dark (not sure if it’s due to the heavy rain). Food was delicious, staff was relatively attentive. Ambience was good. Will consider going again
1
Didn't expect such standard for the price charged. It was really awful and disappointing. Don't think I will ever return again.
3
I was so looking forward to eating here. It's our 2nd time. 1st time was just for drinks as was dining in Dempsey. 2nd time we were entertaining friends from HK. Both times the Rabbit Hole ( the gin bar in the garden was closed for private event). The private event didn't bother us the 1st time but it did the 2nd as all you could hear was the wedding event , and the guests all had to come by our table to get to the restroom. The acoustics aren't great as the building is a beautiful old chapel so sound just reverbs all around. I can't remember the food which is a shame as I was so distracted by the noise from next door. It was also very cold due to the air con so were given shawls to wear. I so wanted there to be a vibe, I wanted to food to impress but all forgettable except for the many drunken guests who were having an awesome time at the wedding :-) It would be great to know when booking whether there is a function on so that you know the outside area is closed. Maybe I should of asked too. So sorry White Rabbit
3
Went for an event.Food quality okay but quantity insufficient. Beers are not as cold as it should be. The restrooms are pathetically small, imagine 150 people in an event and I see a constant queuing to use the restrooms. Seems to be lack of manpower, management please look into this.Ambience was rather nice and spacious, indoor a church like theme and alfesco like a garden.Thanks
3
Staff is rather rude with his comments when taking orders, offended. definately not a pleasant experience
3
I find the food taste is heavy but the service and ambiance is Super good. It’s good for couple dating and small gathering said 3 to 4 pax. Not suitable for a bigger group. And it’s a bit noisy when the place started to get crowded.
3
I've wanted to go to the white rabbit for a long time. I finally went there for brunch with friends. The place is amazing, however the food was disappoiting and very expensive for what you get.Probably better to go there for a drink in the evening or for one of their special parties (eg. Halloween
5
We celebrated our wedding anniversary there and was glad we chose to dine there. We like it that it is in a bucolic place yet near the city, plenty of place to park our car, a pretty beer garden and service is prompt and friendly. We had wagyu steaks which is succulent and seared to our liking. The asparagus and mushroom sides are delight to eat esp if you are a truffle lover. The menu is not exhaustive and the music a tad loud. The nearest bus stop is quite a walk uphill and best reached by car or taxi. Nevertheless, I will revisit if I feel like splurging for that special occasion
4
Interesting brunch selection in a part of Singapore that i rarely visit which is unique. The white rabbit used to be a church so still a lot of Christianity feel to it. Much quieter to the city center and hence more family friendly.
4
The restaurant was beautiful, it was a pity that I didn't have the chance to go to the outdoor bar AKA the rabbit role as there was a wedding party. It was quite noisy tho, not as relaxing as I thought. The food was delicious. I ordered fettuccine carbonara and truffle mac and cheese with mushroom. However the location was not so convenient and there was nothing else to do nearby.
2
Very nice setting; loved the ambience. Service was quite good. Pity the food was rtather mediocre. Firstly, the set menu listed in their website was not up to date. My soup was not hot but the next table's was smoking hot. I decided to pay the extra $15 for the main, which was a seafood vol au vent. Not worth the money. First time I encountered a chewy pastry base -- had difficulty cutting it. My partner's main was a barramundi; a bit skimpy on the serving size and didn't taste anything special. The dessert, though tiny, was about the best part of the meal. Was our first time, and not in any hurry to go back
5
We were in Singapore from the US on business. My wife and I had a wonderful meal. The staff was outstandin
4
I love going to The white rabbit as it has a very unique vibe to it, being in an old church surrounded gorgeous gardens. The atmosphere is super pleasant and airy, ideal for a Sunday brunch - I also appreciate the intimacy you can get with the various booths.And you must try the homemade tonic : perfect for a nice G&
4
I love the ambience, food was quite good and Service staff were friendly and made us feel comfortable
5
Food was not bad, the ambiance was the outstanding part of the experience. The service was very slow though, took way too long for the food to be served
4
A friend of mine recommended us this restaurant. We went here for a breakfast and the egg Benedict was fantastic. I wanted to taste also the crepes but it was sold out. The old church is a nice place and this restaurant is full of locals not of tourists. Take the chance and visit this place when you are in Singapore.
4
Made reservations for a birthday dinner and it didn’t disappoint us. The place was lovely and the food was good. The restaurant even gave a free dessert ice cream with the words ‘Happy Birthday’ for the birthday boy.
5
What a great idea to convert a church into a restaurant. It certainly makes for a wonderful ambiance. We went for Saturday brunch and found the staff very friendly and the food delicious. We're planning on going back for dinner
5
Second time here for my wedding anniversary. Like the ambience, setting and the staff were very attentive. And of course the food was heavenly. Definitely worth a visit again
5
Had a long awaited dinner with a friend at White Rabbit. Besides the Cote de Beouf which was super, the service was impeccable. Will definitely return
5
One of the best beef short ribs! Very tender, juicy and cooked just right! Desserts are really good too! Ambience is better for small groups. Free ample parking on weekday nights. Service is good, though a little slow, so do plan sufficient time.
5
It was our first time there and we love the ambience, service and the food. The waitress, Marisa was particularly attentive to our requests and provided great recommendations that was to our liking after she realized that we like truffle. Although it was our first time meeting her, there was a lot of laughter going on while we place our orders. Our favourite was the truffle chicken for 2 as the chicken is very well done and the portion is good for 4 person to share on top of the mac and cheese and the truffle pasta we have chosen. For a non beef person and for someone who is allergic to prawns, I am glad that there are many other choices available
4
Staffs are attentive, nice ambience, good for couples and girls gathering too, 5 min walking distance to the main road, very accessible even by bus
5
Our family of six, two adults, two teenagers and two children thoroughly enjoyed our pasta, burgers and fish and chips. The crepes and bread and butter pudding were amazing
5
Relax and unwind with good service. convenience parking facility, really nice food for the brunch. Thanks for the people whom recommending the place.
5
Food here is absolutely delectable .. can match any fine dining European restaurant .. the. Carpaccio was just perfect .. itâ€™s one of those tricky dishes which can tilt either ways .. they got it so perfect!! The truffle pasta was amazing .. they could add that extra touch which some European restaurants do when it comes to truffle dishes ... Chef comes over and sprinkles the truffle shavings on the plate!!
4
Very nice place inside a old church. The service is very friendly and efficient.Menu is a bit short on the main courses but the size of the meal are really decent for Singapore.Wine list is very good with a lot of choices of wines by glasses.A bit noisy when it is crowded .Definitely a good place for a dinner for 2.Expect 250 sgd for 2: 3 courses + glasses of wines
4
Comfortable place, easy parking, spacious and bright. Food was nice but a bit pricey. The crepe is a must try
5
Set in a lovely leafy part of Singapore, not far from the Botanic Gardens, the White Rabbit restaurant is housed in an old chapel. It is quite large, with high ceilings. It was a busy Friday night and so a little noisy. Everything was excellent. My wife and I shared the Roast Chicken for two and that bland description does not due it justice. The flavoursome chicken was carved for us and came with lovely vegetables. It was good to see lots of young Singaporean couples eating there. We found the staff professional and friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed the night and would recommend the restaurant. We would be happy to go back
3
I left a review in December about my frustration to have to turn around as we had arrived at 2pm and it was already closed. We decided to give it another try today with a couple of friends for lunch. The setting is really nice. It is a bit expensive but we were expecting it. I wanted to go for the tomato & grilled pepper stew but unfortunately it was not vegetarian nor couldn't be made vegetarian. My friend ordered it and loved it. My husband went for the corned beef special which he enjoyed too, and my other friend for the wagyu beef burger which he liked as well despite being a bit small. In the end I went for eggs benedict with mushrooms. Unfortunately, my eggs were cold and undercooked which was a disappointment. Service was good and the place is truly beautiful so I would be willing to give it another try. I would like to give it a 4 but it was a tad too expensive for what we got
5
There was a good selection. In fact, my friends and I had a hard time choosing because everything sounded yummy. In the end, we ordered a variety to share
4
Food is excellent but the restaurant is a bit noisy and the waiter is not really friendly.The facial expression make people feel uncomfortable
3
Expected a romantic setting but is cafe like. The Seafood Vol-au-Vent was salty with unappetizing pastry,Good that the Crème Brûlée was delicious and partner said trout was good
5
It is the perfect place for a long and relaxing lunch. Located within an old building, the restaurant offers a2 and 3-course set lunches that are outstanding in quality and reasonably priced.
5
Was there for a birthday celebration. The service and food were excellent. Ambience was great too. We enjoyed the dinner and will be back.

I went for a private dinner with my partner and we had a beautiful 4 course menu that was mostly according to my expectations with a few minor comments. The interior, which was one of the main reasons I wanted to come here, was fabulous, and luckily my partner had booked a beautiful table with sofa and not in the middle of the room. I believe for a romantic dinner the tables in the middle are a bit too open and also not so intimate. For a group of friends or business tthese tables are more suitable, so be aware when booking. The interior is elegant and cosy at the same time. I like the sort of casual design but with a hint of elegance in the set up and table arrangements.To the food. We took some time to decide on the menu, and once decided it took a very long time to get the first course. This should have been anticipated by the restaurant and perhaps offered a small Amuse Bouche. I had the trout carpaccio which was good but needed to have a bit of salty condiments to bring the fish taste. The combinations of the dish was a bit too blend. My second course was the fois gras, which was a bit too overcooked and should have been a bit more seared to my taste. My main was a alaska crab pasta, where it was hard to see any of the crab at all, the taste was good but it should have contained a bit more visible pieces of the crab meat. Last but not least we had dessert and this was the best of my disshes, and I'm not even a dessert person. I had the crepes suzettes and they were really tasty, enough of the citrus to make it the delicious classical dish. The presentation of the dishes impeccable, but the taste was a bit blend on the 2 first courses and they could have made a better effort with the pasta dish. My partner had a beautiful beef carpaccio and a slow cooked rib that would have made the food tasting to a 5, but unluckily my choices were not as good and tasty...For the wine I had a crispy dry white as a start, followed by a bottle of pinot noir (red). Both wines lovely. My partner took the recommended riesling, that was slightly too sweet for the trout in my view. I loved the selection of rare wines, and would for sure come back for perhaps brunch to make more out of the large and interesting wine selection.The overall experience of the restaurant is 5 for the interior, 3 to 4 for the food, 5 for the wine, 4 for the service. Overall will come back, hopefully with better selection next time for the food
4
I had the Dover Sole Meunière this time after sharing the Lobster Grilled Cheese and Seafood pot pie with a friend the last time. All were simply amazing. I'm usually rather the meat eater but their seafood both times was so good. For dessert, we ordered the waffles, bread & butter pudding, and madeleines. I'm not a fan of bread & butter pudding but my friends who are said it was amazing - and their custard was spot on. I loved their waffles and madeleines
5
The Atmosphere and service are very good.The food is very nice. Should go there and try if you have time
5
We started off in the bar outside which was very pretty, and then went into the restaurant for our meal. The atmosphere was serene and the food was good. We had to wait a long time for our meals though
5
We loved our date night here. Make sure you go to the bar in the back for a pre dinner drink. It’s an adorable setting. The service was awesome and the food was delicious. It is a little pricey but worth the experience for a special occasion. We will be back!!
5
At first I was skeptical when I made a special request via Chope! I am amazed that the service crews here accommodated to my special request and the services provided went far beyond my expectations! The food and ambience were great and I wouldn't hesitate to come back again :)
5
Great food, great ambience & good service. The set lunch that I have ordered was well prepared and I did not wait for too long a time. The environment of the restaurant is great. The waiters and waitresses were very friendly and helpful
5
It was my first date cum birthday celebration ..White Rabbit has certainly surpass the expectations I had !Food was delicious and th staffs were warm n welcoming .Great job and keep it up 
5
Good ambience, not bad service and amazing food. If it’s pretty dim though if you’re not the type who favors dine in the semi dark.

The White Rabbit has a wonderful setting in an old chapel in leafy surroundings...but that is where the good part ends. We had a table booked for 7.45, but out order was not taken until 9.30 after summoning staff to take it. Staff may well be attentive during service, but getting there attention before ordering is not so good. Plenty of staff milling about, but I am not sure they are occupying their time as well as they could...or perhaps the kitchen cannot cope with too many orders at once?We ordered from the a la Carte dinner menu. Classing the food as 'Modern European Classics' is a bit misleading. Most of the mains are distinctly British rather than, as expected, a more widely 'European' base. The inclusion of Mac & Cheese was a little odd as this is now produced more often as a side in the US rather than Europe (although I remember it was popular in the 1960s UK 'tea'). The dishes can be classed as classics...they have been around for years, but there is not much particularly modern about the menu, other than presentation. European cuisine (even British) is now much more exciting than mere 'pictures on a plate'. Modern cuisine involves more novel cooking methods and presentation, with unusual taste combinations... such as would be expected from a menu priced so high. Overall the food was tasty, but not particularly inspired and definitely overpriced for what was produce
4
Wife and I celebrated our anniversary there. Service is very good however we find the food mediocre. To us, good service wins it all. Thanks you, rabbit for the little surprise!
5
We were there for the first time to celebrate birthday. Feedback from birthday twins : fabulous embient, great food and good wine

The staff were very friendly and approachable, willing to go out of their way to serve you, give you recommendations on wine/food, and happy to take photos for you.The food was a tad overpriced considering how small the portions were, but the food was quite good (not the best, don't expect to be mind blown, but it was still pretty good!).My main complaint was that we ordered a 4-course set dinner, and for some reason we got the 5-course set dinner. We didn't realise until the 5th course came out, and by then it was too late and we ended up paying more than $70 extra because the waiter wrote the order wrong... that extra $70 almost made me faint when I saw the bill :(As a reference, we spent around $400-450 total after GST and Service Fee's were added
5
Will go again. Setting and environment is conducive for couples. Food is nice but a little pricey. Overall experience is good
3
Really beautiful setting in a converted church, but wished that the food was better. Our confit trout was mushy and overly salted. All my business guest didn't finish their courses. However the set lunch was really value for money and service was immaculate.
4
food quality is good overall, service is superb, but the best attribute is the ambiance. the interior of the building compliments the overall dining experience.

Went here for Sunday brunch and staff graciously accommodated us despite being 30 minutes late for our reservation. Basing from the diners around us, I could tell that this is a popular choice of locals to celebrate anniversaries and other milestones. Our group ordered burrata, lobster grilled cheese, angus quarter pounder and fettucine carbonara. All the dishes tasted fine, but nothing extraordinary. Could probably get the same taste and quality of their dishes elsewhere at a cheaper price. What made the meal special was the very attentive staff who made sure our glasses never ran out of water and attended quickly to any request. The place itself was beautiful. I'm a fan of old churches and I believe The White Rabbit did a good job restoring the place but also putting a modern touch to it. The outdoor setting of the restaurant serves as a casual cocktail bar more reminiscent of the Alice in Wonderland theme.Overall vibe reminded me of Blackbird at Makati, Philippines. Historical piece of architecture restored and refurbished as an upscale restaurant. Would recommend this place for those looking for a nice place to have brunch or dinner, but definitely not the kind of place to eat at on a frequent basis.
5
The experience I had was wonderful. Staff were very initiative and accommodating to my demands and needs.
4
Both Joanne n Shawn have not been to White Rabbit. They were impressed with the food served and the service we received. Special thanks to the server who took a photo of us n presented it as a good memorial gift for Joanne

When I arrived at 1:45pm, I was told that the restaurant was full when there were obviously a few empty tables around. Did the staff think we were blind? I have been to many restaurants which are much more expensive and I have never encountered this. Worst service ever. This restaurant does not even deserve zero star. I would give - 1 star
5
Visited the restaurant for dinner and the food was excellent. Especially love the ambience of the place. We were impressed by the service standards. The staffs were very attentive and prompt. We definitely enjoy our evening.One thing to highlight is that the staff had good knowledge on wines (they had a good selection) and he patiently recommended us on which would pair best with the dishes we chose. We felt that it was a delight. Will definitely visit again soon! Thank you for an amazing time

My husband and I had the Alaskan Crab pasta and the Pork Chop and they were both so delicious. Almost everything was perfect. The food, the ambience and the seat we got was cosy. The thing that costed them 1 star was that one of their staff kept trying to sell us a bottle of wine. My husband and I don't drink a lot. We usually stop at one glass but he insisted we would have a second and that the bottle would be worth it. Furthermore, when the staff poured the wine in the glass for a taster, my husband declined and said to just pour a full glass, we would be happy with it. Again, the staff insisted. It was quite unprofessional of him and if it wasn't for this staff, this review would've gotten 5 stars.
5
It was a great experience. I made a reservation online saying that it was our wedding anniversary. Then after the food was served, we were given free ice cream with chocolate text on the plate saying happy anniversary.
4
We were seated at sofa seat, which was very comfortable. Staff were generally polite and attentive. Food was great especially the wagyu burger and the lobster sandwich.
5
service staff is great in giving recommendations for wine paring with the prix fixe menu. generally the food are well executed.
5
Would like to speak to a person instead of making a reservation online because we sometimes have more request. Seems it is not easy to be in touch with the restaurant
5
The White Rabbit was just a fantastic experience on all fronts. We went with our boys (7 and 3 yrs old) for Sunday brunch and the service, food and ambience was just amazing. A definite top restaurant for us moving forward. The outside area was lovely and the kids enjoyed the swing. Total bill came to $140 for the 4 of us so quiet reasonable for the quality of the food. I have the Wagyu corn beef sandwich and the Mac and Cheese and Hamburger for the kids was made with fresh ingredients. Hope whoever reads this goes.
2
I have had White Rabbit on my list for quite awhile now. The room is quite lovely and has good atmosphere. Service was fine though a little slow. But the food was expensive and disappointing. The truffled pasta has an unpleasant mealy texture and a salty taste and was very weak on the truffle flavor. Wine by the glass was meh. Not worth it, will not repeat.
4
Had dinner at the White Rabbit last night. It's a resturant in an old chapel. Has beautiful high ceilings and great service. The food has always been good but last night, the pork I had turned out badly and I only ate a little of it. They are apologetic enough not charge me. I have always enjoyed the place, so will return.
5
From the moment we stepped into the restaurant we were awestruck. Granted, we had done our research and known that it was a converted chapel but seeing it for the first time is something else altogether. The service staff were excellent and provided good recommendations for food when we were spoilt for choice. The food is on the pricey side but it is wonderful and the atmosphere more than makes up for it
3
Nice ambience and setup. Staff was friendly and attentive to our needs. However, the food was not very warm.
4
Truffle pasta came with loads of generously shaved truffles. Dover Sole Meuniere was good.Wish there were more choices on the ala carte mains. Staff were excellent except for one waiter who seemed unnecessarily studious/borderline-arrogant
4
Fantastic church like atmosphere and food was impeccable and so was the staff. Very spacious and quite an eye opener. Highly recommended
5
Nice restaurant, with a great service! The choice of meal for vegetarian and desserts could be a bit wider. All the team was really kind and professional for our special evening. Thanks
4
Service staff was attentive and realised one of us were celebrating birthday. They took the initiative to put a candle on the dessert and wrote happy birthday.
5
Excellent service and food! Had the beef ribs and Alaskan crab pasta, superb and definitely recommended
5
Staff were warm and made this dinner a special occasion with their excellent service. Really enjoyed our time there :
4
Booked the restaurant for my boyfriend birthday celebrate. Had a romantic time. Great service from the staffs. Food and portion was delightful. They even take a picture for us, appreciate their lovely gesture
4
Made a reservation a couple days before the visit, indicating my fiancee and I are going to celebrate our 1 year engagement anniversary on National Day at The White Rabbit, and to have them surprise us, under the any request section.+service staff were extremely polite and ever attentive+when we arrived, we were directed to the cushion seats that can easily seat 6 pax+they waived 1 side from the bill due to "wrong" order (see below)+the 36-hour Brandt Shortribs was really tender and delicious+the dessert (Crepes Suzette) from 4 Course was prepared in front of you, a beautiful sight to behold+just when we were done with the desserts, came another dessert to celebrate our 1st anniversay+service staff took a picture of us and printed it for our keepsake-did not time, but we experience uncomfortably long waiting time for the Australian Wagyu Steak to be served-ordered medium rare, but the steak was served almost towards medium well (informed the service staff and they made the kitchen prepare again to which it was served medium rare after another long waitOverall, it was a pleasant experience
3
We had previously enjoyed the lobster bisque, but this time it was so salty it was impossible to finish it. We were told that the chef was not there and they had another cook do the cooking. As a gesture of goodwill they didn't charge us for the lobster bisque. The other dishes we ordered were quite all right.
5
Went to White Rabbit for dinner to celebrate the wife's birthday. Its an old chapel with high ceiling and stained glass windows. Great ambience, though a little pricey but the food and service quality was worth it. We ordered the short ribs and it was perfectly done. Tender and moist, explosion of flavours, highly recommended. If ur here for dinner, come a little earlier and take photos at the Rabbit Hole, their outdoor bar and catch a view of the sunset
5
Although food menu was quite limited. But food quality still maintain. Service was GD as well. Will definitely visit the place again
5
Good place for couple. The staff were always readily available and service was excellent. Food is generally okay but not super fantastic. We had the pork and crab pasta
5
A great place for a special occasion. Everything said about the gin & tonic is all true ... a must try. The ambience is truly amazing, and completes the beautiful meal. Presentation is flawless, flavours well-balanced and portions just right. The 36 hour braised short ribs are the best I've ever had. Some older restaurants go downhill over the years but this is such a gem 
3
went once with business associates for dinner, old rustic place - a former british camp chapel... good wine, good food, but serving was really too small.... still worth a visit but order more : 
5
Made a trip down to this historical site to try out their lunch menu. The staff were extremely professional in their service, and attentive to our every need. Ordered scallops ceviche and ocean trout from the lunch menu - I must say the seafood was very fresh and made to perfection. The trout was one of the best I've eaten in a while. To close everything off, a refreshing creme brulee - all for a decent price. Totally worth my trip here
4
High end, fine dining restaurant with very good ambience. The staff was very well behaved and courteous. Good choice of main courses, ordered the steamed fish. Wide range of wine, Argentinian wine was really good.
5
visited this captivating restaurant housed in a beautiful church building and surrounded by lush, abundant greenery and I must say, I was in awe! then greeted by amazing service staff, who was extremely attentive and alert.then came the food; food was ambrosial! the 36h short ribs..... wished it never ended! they were really generous with the crab for the tagliatelle. the wagyu carpaccio was delicious. if you're coming with more than a party of 4, order more than 1. my party of 8 ordered 3 and we still couldn't get enough! the lobster bisque was so savoury, a total crowd pleaser and kickstarted the path to mains well!they've got a gin garden that's amazing; gins that you don't usually find in a bar. topped with their own homegrown garnish (yes, grown in their backyard) and homemade tonic water. a whole new experience for my group and I, especially since we're all gin lovers.the service staff ensured consistency by checking up on us and when they found out that it was one of our birthdays, they went the extra mile by taking a photo of us and printing them out for us as a memory!total must visit, if you're a tourist. if you're local and have never been here, what are you waiting for?
5
We came here for dinner and I love everything about the restaurant. The food were very good, staffs were attentive and friendly and very accommodating for all our requests and the ambience is fantastic. Gin and Tonic was superb, very refreshing and a must try. The frisee salad was good and the Alaskan king crab pasta as their signature is so perfect for me, the smell and taste leaves you a feeling of wanting for more. Overall, it was a great experience. We'll definitely come back soon.
4
My favourite in Singapore so far - the Gin Bar is delicious. The setting is an old church and although it is a little secluded in location it has a great bar and it is a spacious venue
5
Visited whilst on holiday in singapore. Amazing food the chicken and short ribs were delicious, and the service was impecable
5
Had an amazing time here. The service was the best I've had in singapore and the food was displayed beautifully and very tasty. Pricey but worth it!
5
The White Rabbit is a gem found at the outskirt of Dempsey. It is far too good not to share. I have kept going back there for the past one month. It is perfect for me in any occasion; whether is a romantic dinner for two in an extraordinary chapel, or a friends' night out with wine and dine, to a chill out G&T at the exceptional outdoor garden bar.In term of food and beverage:1. They serve a pretty affordable set lunch with amazing selections; especially their succulent 'Duck Confit' and 'Seafood Vou-Au-Vent' were unforgettable.2. The Lobster Bisque and 36 hours Short Ribs are Must Try!!!3. The cheese toasts in the bar snacks menu are the best in the whole wide world!!!4. I would suggest you to look for a sommelier for bottle wine recommendations from their extensive wine lists and prepare to expect the unexpected. I was recommended to try 'Not Your Grandma's Rose'. Initially, I thought he was joking but it turned out to be so good.5. Save the best to the last, the Gin & Tonic they serve is out of this world, you can only taste it to believe.Lastly, it is amazing how every staffs could always provide excellent service and make it seems effortlessly!! Everytime I am back makes me feels like home~
5
Been here for a few times but everything was always awesome.. the restaurant itself felt like your in wonderland.. food was delicious and wide range of wine selection.. the outside was a garden gin bar which is very unique. Overall, service was lovely and everyone are so welcoming. Thank you!! We really enjoy it.
4
Food and service were fantastic (except fish was not boneless). Room is rather dark. Location is out of place. Loved the truffle fries (genuine truffle, not the truffle sauce in some other restaurants)
5
"Modern, peaceful, and cozy vibe with delicious dishes"I had a great night with my family at The White Rabbit.Didn't expect too much, but there are very kind staffs with great smile:)and delicious foods. Especially the event making crepe was little pleasure for me.Thank you guys!
5
We had a lovely dinner at The White Rabbit. The food was delicious. We had Alaskan King Crab Pasta for main course and it was divine! The service was excellent, very attentive staff.It was indeed a great expression. We will definitely visit again!
5
White rabbit is perfect for a date night.The staff was really friendly and attentive.Food was amazing. Especially the short rib
5
Given the impeccable service and tasty variety of food makes me come back for the second time to celebrate my birthday! My partner and I loved the Lobster Bisque and Foie Gras is the Best dishes! A plus point is that the restaurant is housed in an old Church, thus a photo worthy place for a nice dining experience
5
The food was delicious! I had Alaskan king crab tagliatelle and the husband has beef cheeks (the specials). And because I absolutely love cheese, I ended the night with a cheese platter. It was nice, but I have had better ones.
5
A restaurant that I would always return to for special occasions. Food is always delish—love the warm tomato bread, truffled m&c w/ mushrooms, the classic mains like the Alaskan king crab tagliatelle and the desserts! The white rabbit punch cocktail served in a bowl is a personal fave too. Service is impeccable and the ambience is amazing. Always a wonderful dining experience.
5
Ambiance was great, it was really an experience dinning in a cathedral setting. The Petuna Ocean Trout and the scallop ceviche was heavenly!
4
nice ambience... food is unique.but the soup not so great.. good customer service... but overall still goo
5
We came here after already had lunch somewhere else. so we had very light food, plus desert. I really liked the building - it is converted from an old church. It does not look like they use any air conditioner. But the high ceiling kept this place cool in hot summer. The coloured glass windows are so beautiful!The service was great. They served he desert my friend ordered late, so they told us it would be for free. I think it is the best serviced restaurant I have experienced in Singapore
4
The staffs are quite friendly, they help take a photo of us. The food is average level, ordered the beef burger but seems the beef was over cooked, so it tasted bitterâ€¦Anyway, it is a good choice for a weekend brunch.
3
While place is conducive for business lunch, I must say the service can be hit and miss. While there is enough service staff around, they are not really attentive and you need to ask for top up of water. Even when asking for bill, it took a while to get the staff's attention. The meal is enjoyable though. The set lunch is nice with decent choices.
5
Unique atmosphere & ambiance, the chapel itself is already worth the visit. Perfect for special occasions. Good quality food (the pancakes are a must!) and a lovely bar&garden at the Rabbit Hole
5
Went there with a party of 6, the place I must say has a nice decoration. The food was great, and the service staff knows their product well. We had tried the ala carte menu and the total cost per pax was reasonable for dining in similar range restaurants.. I will definitely come back again
5
Had set lunch at restaurant. Really enjoyable meal for my friend's birthday celebration. Quality food and helpful service crew. Highly recommended
5
Arrived at the Rabbit Hole first had a few drinks in the garden. Then headed inside to an amazing restaurant and even better food. Some of the best beef cheek I have ever tasted. 100% will be back. Rabbit hole is great for a pre evening drinks and we had children with us who played in the gardens next door.
5
Honestly was not expecting much due to reviews from friends and thinking it might just be an instaworthy place. Was pleasantly surprised by the lobster cheese sandwich and the roast of the day was nicely done as well. Will be back!
5
Good food and service. Recommended for gatherings. Cons was that it was out of the way in a secluded area. Only accessible via car / cabs. Otherwise, its a good venue.
5
took my girlfriend out to enjoy a good meal for her birthday. wanted to visit this place as this is one of the choice venue to hold our wedding reception. as all other reviews has state, the ambience is lovely, residing in the quaint and hilly part of dempsey. can't nitpick on the food, really well prepared. I had the 5 courses prix fixed menu and she had monthly beef cheek. tummy satisfied. and it's really good to take a stroll out towards botanical gardens after the meal. impeccable service, great food, happy tummies
5
We had a great experience celebrating a friend's birthday. The staff was wonderful and provided a complimentary birthday cake.
4
If you have never been in a restaurant made out of an old church, go for it. I loved the setting, it's something quite unusual, however, the menu is too small with limited options. On the bright side they have some very good gin tonics
5
Had a great night with very well attention and service with my booking for 2 pax. Enjoyed the place, ambience and food as well.
5
The refurbished church decor is simply amazing. Dining inside gives you a feeling that you're not in Singapore, and that's really special. The food is great and prices are not cut throat. Loved it through and through.
3
The building is really pretty. Cosy atmosphere. The gin bar at the back is pretty too. We had a very good short ribs and the mac and cheese were really tasty too.
5
We love it! Perfect food, very good ambiance, very nice decoration and excellent service. Can't ask for more. In addition, we tried the Iberian Pork Chop and Truffle Pasta, both are to die for!
5
Ordered the 1kg Wagyu Beef for 2 pax. The quality was great however the fat content was abit too much for us. The taste was charred perfectly though. Ordered the foie gras for appetiser but the portion was rather small. Service and ambience was great though. They arranged for a simple dessert for my fiancÃ© who was celebrating his birthday
4
Celebrate birthday here, lunchtime. Received Great service, food was quite okay. Ambience was really very clean, open and bright
4
i ll say go for the beef and short ribs sides. pasta for me was not so impressive, was okey but will never order again if i m even coming back dover sole fish was excellent, the waiter actually goes and unboned it on your tableside in less than 3 minutes so you could have it bone free 
5
Love the atmosphere. Lobster bisque was a bit salty but the lobster meat was generous. Like the appetiser size for pasta - just the right amount for me. We ordered the chocolate tart with lavender ice cream which was excellent too
1
We had our table reserved at 2:30pm, in the menu written the food is served until 3pm. And so we are late and arrived at the restaurant at 2:40pm, and they told us that we are late and the kitchen already closed at 2:30pm sharp. After our arguement, they allowed us to go in just for beverages. Then while we are still having our drinks, the MANAGER told the waiter it was late and asked to send us the bill to request us to leave. It was an really terrible experience
4
Great ambience and food here. Had steak and pork in their dinner menu and both tasted fantastic. Dining time can be restricted due to their reservations coming in but we spent a good 1.5hrs in the restaurant for my birthday. Service didn't seem very welcoming, not sure if it's because we did not order wine from their drinks menu or what. Still, will highly recommend for the place and food.
4
Very good Eggs Benedict with mushrooms served on toasted English muffins and side salad, hollandaise sauce not overpowering. Wagyu burger decent, could be juicier.
5
A great venue for brunch. The place is beautiful and the service are great. A good place for people who would like to take some nice photos too
4
The restaurant was a chapel from 1930s with original stained glass and floor. Food was exquisite. There were 4 of us and we had the 4 course set lunch. From the starter to the dessert, nothing disappointed us.
5
I planned my proposal at the White Rabbit and the staff was well trained to help me out with the simple proposal. Had a wonderful and memorable night. Slightly pricey though
4
Ambience was cosy yet elegant (could be due to the couch I was sitting at). Great place for couples as it's a pretty romantic spot. Was there for brunch; ordered the lobster grilled sandwich, eggs benedict (smoked salmon), and a maple bourbon waffle. Flavour of the lobster sandwich was good except the lobster meat was overcooked, hence we had rubber big chunks of lobster in the sandwich.. A total waste the maple bourbon waffle was immaculately done; it had the perfect balance of crisp on the outside and soft, and buttery goodness on the inside. Eggs benedict was nothing special, as the bread turned mushy real fast & the hollandaise wasnt as flavourful as I hoped for. Overall experience was still good though, the waffle, ambience and service made up for lacklustre in some of the dishes.
5
Weekday lunch set menu is fabulous, prawn bisque is very tasty with fresh prawn, toasted barumundi fish and dessert made perfectly matched with the beautiful ambience. However, when we first arrived, we were given 2 small table for 6 pax, and all around there were still so many seats, so a bit disappointed with the service. But overall, still good dining experience
4
Overall, the ambience is very nice, great for special occasion, romantic and nice place for small group celebration. We had the ribs and pork collar. Both are well done. Overall is great. Price is a little steep. Nice Wine place to wind down.
4
The White Rabbit commands quite an impression while you approach, a beautiful, small, white church in a tree reach hilly environment. Inside is a pleasant, but noisy, restaurant that provides you with a good service. The food is okay and the wine list too, but the real deal never really lives up to the feeling you have in your first approach ..
5
Made a reservation for dinner on a weekend with my family. The staffs are friendly and polite. The food is delicious but abit pricy.
5
I booked a table at the white rabbit as a surprise to my parents for their 28th anniversary and although my online coupon didn't work the waiters not only went above and beyond to make sure we had a pleasant evening but they surprised us with a little anniversary dessert and took a picture of the entire family. Now , I can't begin to describe the perfectly selected menu, which was not only enjoyed by all, but satisfying on all levels, and was perfectly portioned. Thank you white rabbit for making the evening special for both my parents and the entire family.
4
This is my second visit in 2 months. Lovely food especially the beef short ribs and great service.
5
Staff were very gentle and friendly. Food was good but as it is fine dining so it is not enough to fill my tummy. Having said so, this is a lovely place and cannot be missed
5
Brought my hubby and daughter for his birthday dinner and food was really good and we really like the ambience. And the friendly staff also helped us take a family picture and we were presented a instant photo as a momento. Food portion is good and is reasonably priced. Highly recommended for couples.
2
We had to wait long for our drinks. We took the set menu for dinner. The portions were incredibly small. My guests and myself were really hungry. We we mentioned this and asked for 2 pieces extra chees, they charged us SGD 112. After some discussion they dropped this amount.The place is really overpriced
4
Causal dining suitable for family with kids! Food is nicely presented. The Crepe Suzette is nicely done in front of diners
4
Everything we had was really good. From the Aussie steak to the Mac & Cheese! The problem with this resto is that it is so hard to get reservation. They should make their place expandable to extend to the Rabbit Hole area.
3
My oldest son has wanted to go to The White Rabbit since we moved to Singapore last year. We finally went to celebrate my youngest son's birthday. It's a very charming space. Very lovely atmosphere. The service was very good. The food was hit and miss. The appetizers were very good. I had the Burrata. My oldest had the lobster bisque. My husband had a salad and my youngest had the truffle mac and cheese. All of those were tasty. 2 of us had the Dover sole that was deboned table side. Honestly, in all my years of having Dover sole, this is the first time I encountered bones. Both of us did. My oldest had the Beef Wellington and he said it was fantastic. My husband had a pasta dish and enjoyed it. This is where things get not so good. We ordered the Brussel sprouts and carrot side dishes to share. They were just awful! The carrots were very hard with a terrible sauce on them that made them inedible. The Brussel sprouts were burnt. I mean they were charred and had no flavor but burned sprouts. Very disappointing. We had the table side crepes and they were ok. Very small portion. We also had the banana toffee dessert and it was just ok. The crust was so hard, you almost needed a knife to cut it. It seemed like it was a frozen, pre made dessert. They never acknowledged that it was my sons birthday even though I stayed it was in all capital letters on our reservation. They did get him a dessert with a candle, but we didn't eat it. the chocolate tart was so bitter inside and out, it was unappetizing to all 4 of us. He did enjoy the unusual flavor ice cream. Overall disappointed that we chose this spot for his birthday dinner, especially since our son said he wished we had picked somewhere better......:
4
Celebrated a friend's birthday here, food was average and the serving time is kinda slow that my Friends almost fallen asleep. However, the overall experience for me was satisfactory.
5
The restaurant is always busy and twice we could not get a seat so we made an online reservation this time. The official entrance via the rabbit hole is nicely decorated with lights and feels like going into wonderland. The restaurant was an old chapel so the interior is really nice. Service is good although it took a bit long to serve food. We had half a dozen seasonal oyster, wagyu beef, asparagus and truffles pasta with a bottle of wine recommended by the waiter. The oyster is fresh and beef very well cooked - pink and medium throughout the whole piece. Normally I do not eat pasta outside as it is easy to cook at home but the truffle pasta with onsen egg (which they forgot but later brought it) was very tasty. Wine was good as well. Overall the whole dining experience was great. Only drawback is the place gets noisy as there is no soft material to absorb noise. But I would definitely come again and recommend others as well
3
We went here with my mother for an evening out. The restaurant was quite quiet with only 4 bookings though there was a large party of around 8-10 people for a birthday celebration. Given the reputation of the restaurant I was expecting a bit more from everything from service, food, menu choice etc.It was all nice enough but just that. For the money I didn't feel I got great value but had a reasonably pleasant evening
4
The food was good, I believe that the Truffle Mac and Cheese is a MUST HAVE.The Dover Sole Meuniere was de-bone very finely. It could afford to have a bot more taste to it in my opinion.As for the Grilled Iberian Pork Chop, excellent all the way.The managers could be a little more friendlier and genuine though(those wearing suits). The waiters and waitresses were much more friendlier.
5
The starters were fantastic, main was as fantastic, except for the Alaskan King Crap (my friend had it) that we find nothing to rave about. Desserts was refreshing.
5
Everything here is at place: the atmosphere, food and service all top quality. Being a former church makes it very special. If you do not want to count the last penny this is the right choice
5
Always good. Never disappoint. Service is excellent. Ambience is good. Love the old church structure
5
We had a lovely evening. Went yo celebrate my birthday with the family and had a very nice evening. Food was excelent as well as service. They even gave me a picture of us sitting at the table
4
the 36 hour brandt short rib was delightful and the chocolate cake was rich and thick with a nice contrasting biscuit base. though the building itself was very pretty, it was a tad too dark
3
The place is really beautiful for a brunch, but the food was so-so. I ordered White Rabbit Fried Up which is supposed to be signature dish, yet the portion is pathetic and the taste was quite plain
4
The food was nice, portion was okay, ambiance was soothing and service was great. An enjoyable dining experience
5
Really enjoyed the food as it was very extraordinary good. Simple ingredients but unique taste. Service was also top notch. Very observant and helpful team! Thanks Anne and JJ for making this an enjoyable meal! Very nice surprise for my hubby birthday. Thank you
5
Nice place to have a lunch meeting. If you reserve early, can get one of the booth-like seats. Service and food quality was pretty good too. Will try the Rabbit Hole next to sample the gin selection.
4
Had a lovely brunch at a leisurely pace at the White Rabbit . Friend ordered the Fry-up n I had Omelette and Mushrooms, and a cappuccino each. We followed that up with tea served in pretty glass teapots accompanied by a little rabbit cookie. So cute
5
Reserved a table at White Rabbit for the birthday of my wife. There is not much to say, everything was just perfect.The food and the service were as expected from restaurants in this price range. We will definitely visit again
5
The place offers quality food with reasonable price. There was an hic-cup with the kitchen as we waiting 20mins for the food. But it was compensated by an lobster bisque and the wonderful service of the staff. Please keep up the good work.
3
If you would like to celebrate a special occasion or like to have brunch/breakfast in sunny , breezy restaurant with beautiful scene, the white rabbit will be your pick. If you, on the other hand, expect to have some fabulous food that worth going back, this place will not be your first choice
5
The main entrance is not too attractive, the restaurant is like a church, not too many choices on the menu, but the food is good. The hidden gem is the big piece of grass at the back of the restaurant, we thought we are in England. Affordable food and very much enjoyed the peaceful backyard
4
It's a mixed review. We tried 5 different dishes on the menu. 2 were superb. 1 was average. 1 had a sauce that was over reduced therefore too salty and the brownie was dry. Service was wonderful though
4
The Free Flow Tomato Vegetable Bread is so fresh and delicious with butter. The 36-hour Brandt Shortribs and the Grilled Iberian Pork Chop are tender and tasty. It goes well with the Black Truffle Fries. We enjoyed the desserts, Crepes Suzette and Banofee Pie, as our birthday celebration. What an unique "fairy tale" dining experience
4
Had a wonderful lunch at the white rabbit, food was excellent and good choice of wine list. There aren't many people there at lunch time so may be better to go for dinner

Situated within walking distance of the Botanic Gardens, this exquisite restaurant is located in a former army barracks church, with many of the original features retained. Excellent food accompanied by a lively Gin bar! A must to try!
5
The staff was very attentive, courteous and friendly. Service is something that I appreciate very much!
3
One of the more attractive dining rooms on Dempsey Hill, as it is a converted chapel. The food is alright, but is certainly below the (high) average of the restaurants in this area.
4
Should have more vegetarian options. It seems that food at dinner tastes better than lunch. Having canopy along walkway will b helpfu
5
Service was great. Food was great ambience was great. Overall a good place for a quiet meal with someone special
5
The staff was very professional and service was good too.. The food is great as well. After your meal you can also go to the Rabbit Hole to take your photo 
4
Lovely atmospheric restaurant with a very cool gin bar. Food was good and came very quickly.Not pretentiou
4
Food always good here. Lunch set meals are value for money. Main courses change quite regularly and portion is decen
5
Service staff are attentive and courteous. Food quality is good. Had trout which was so fresh and cooked to near perfection maintaining the tenderness of the fish texture. Ambience is excellent for birthday celebration.

It looked like it may have been a former church or chapel. We came in from the back from the car park, and walked past a playing field for croquet, where Alice or the Queen of Hearts could have been that afternoon.Then we went through 'The Rabbit Hole' bar before we reached the dining room. It was a lovely walk.The whole complex is rather conducive to romantic early evenings and dinners. We were shown to our table and we noticed that the clientele was mostly young professionals. This was a Sunday evening and the room was booked solid.We had come for the Gillardeau oysters and were so disappointed that the Sunday brunch had sold out the oysters. Service was very friendly; to our surprise we were greeted by Jonson who recognised us from another restaurant we had been to the previous week. We had not realized the restaurants were managed by the same company. For starters we ordered Lobster Bisque. It was fantastic and the best we ever had. The bisque came with half a Maine lobster in it. For mains my partner had Alaskan King Crab Tagliatelle and he was disappointed; there was not enough crab meat with the pasta, definitely not worth the $40+ price tag. I had the Truffled Pasta with 'onsen' egg. It was not remarkable. For dessert, although we were tempted by the Crepe Suzette which many diners ordered, we opted to share a Baked Alaska which was not too bad.Jonson recommended a beautiful bottle of white wine to go with our meal.Overall we did enjoy our evening
5
Delightful service since when the drink I ordered took a tad bit longer to arrive than it should have, they offered to charge it on the house. It was also a pleasant surprise to find out that majority of the servers working there were fellow Filipino citizens. :)
4
Celebrated our anniversary here. Is really really an amazing dinner. Great food... Great ambience! Great & attentive service. The shortrib is charred just melts in e mouth. Lobster Bisque do awesome & flavourful. Valrona chocolate with lavender ice cream... So rich yet relaxing. Imagine having chocolate ice cream in a spa.Thanks JJ & team for the fantastic service! We'll b back
4
We had an awesome experience. The only concern was the placemat material was paper. The white projector lights on top of the beam were not compatible with the whole concept.Apart for that, we had an awesome meal and an awesome dining experience
5
Quality food with excellent atmosphere and great service! We had Truffle Pasta, Grilled Iberian Pork Chop, Alaskan King Crab Tagliatelle, Grilled Asparagus & Truffled Hollandaise (Superb), Truffled Mac & Cheese with Mushrooms, Duo Chocolate Tart, and Crepes Suzette for 4 adults. Definitely worth those calories!
5
The food was really, really good and the staff very friendly. The choices of wine were alright. My favorite was the deserts. Very nice crepe and a good show at the table.
4
Good executive lunch sets to eat with colleagues. Reasonable price points for the fact that we were celebrating fellow colleagues' Birthday. Value for money for most dishes. Nice atmosphere - this place used to be a chapel, for celebratory lunch. However when the restaurant started to fill with patrons, the place gets noisy and I also wished the background music was of softer genre than some fast tempo music. Among us, we had sunchoke veloute, scallops and endives for starters. The starters' taste were all well balanced. We ordered Alaskan king crab tagliatelle, duck confit and petuna ocean trout for mains. Except for the duck confit which was on the salty side, the other two mains were cooked just right and of right serving sizes. We topped it off with fudge brownies and warm chocolate mousse for desserts. The brownies, although looked dry, was surprisingly moist and had hazelnuts of right crunch. As it was a birthday lunch, the staff jazzed up the brownies with some decorations (although I was hoping for a complimentary dessert for the birthday girl which I indicated in my chope reservation) and took a Polaroid for free for keepsake. Service was good and attentive. And I almost forgot to mention, the bread roll was nicely baked, crusty on outside and soft on inside, we couldn't help but asked for second helping.
3
Requested for a quiet table n cake to celebrate my hubby birthday but all these were ignored. Disappointed
5
The ambience at the White Rabbit is amazing and the service was impeccable! the food is delicious. We will return! It feels like such a special place to wear something a little nicer but people wear very casual attire
4
The foods are good and the service is excellent. Very spacious venue for family gathering. we will definitely visit this place agai
4
Food was pretty good albeit being a bit pricey being the most expensive among the 3 French/European Restaurant at Dempsey (Au Petit & Disgruntled Chef). Did not really prefer the old church remodeled looks though. Service was good and the servers are polite. Overall, its a nice experience and highly recommended
1
The food quality has declined significantly. Much of the food was tasteless and completely mismatched. The tuna appetizer was essentially 3 pieces of 2cm cube shaped chunks of tasteless tuna on even more tasteless mushy peas. I could not even finish this dish as it tasted so bland and bad. The steak was completely dried out and served on a bed of creamed corn kernels??! I cancelled my desert as the starters and main were so disappointing. This is for sure the last visit for me.I would not eat the food even if it were free.
4
Food was very good & interesting gins outside at the Rabbit Hole with homemade tonic water. A little too dark for menu reading & really do think it is a restaurant for adults not for children to be running around. Unsure of dress code - but we were entertained by this!!!
5
The food is nice, the location of the restaurant is easy to find. as well as the service.There happens a wedding in the yard, romanticism
4
We celebrated a special occasion at the White Rabbit and the service was exemplary. The food was innovative, beautifully presented and the wine list extensive. I was a little disappointed with actual surroundings however - advertised as a beautiful old chapel - well yes there are stained glass windows each end of the building but otherwise it is a space with little ambience.Overall though a wonderful dinner and I would recommend the White Rabbit as a great place for a fabulous meal
3
Love the place, waitress was not as professional as expected to be given the menu is of a certain standard. My bread came with no butter and while pushing the dessert cart (to cook the crepes), it felt like they were dragging their feet and pushing a dimsum cart in a chinese restaurant. This can be improved i'm sure, but they were very friendly.
5
Went to this spur of the moment brunch choice, after hearing about the great venue. Cozy and unique ambience at this former church, with good food to match. Food took a little while to get to us, but worth the wait for their classic lobster and cheese sandwich. Definitely recommend the crepe suzette as well, and their tasty coffees. Nice environment to eat in and very Instagram worthy background.
4
Located along the hills. An old church converted into a restaurant. Food is pricey but good. We liked the sole and the lobster grilled cheese. Ordering the butchers block is good for big groups. The steak was softer than it looks. Very tender. Reservation would be best.
3
Very beautiful place. My Husband and I went there for our wedding anniversary dinner. Food was just okie (can be better). Abit on the pricey side.
3
Few dishes personally I would recommend:Classic Lobster Bisque (you will get a half juicy lobster, soup serve in a pot, the brandy is not too strong but the soup is "gao"-superb, goes with bread will be not so salty) is a little pricy though $38.If you are a truffle person, can go for their truffle pasta.The Alaska King Crab Tagliatelle is salty and is not a normal dry pasta (pork broth)if you are a meat eater and or have people to share your food, can go for their Waygu Cote de Boeuf - 1kg Australian grain-fed roast beef serve with truffle / bernaise saude. It doesn't comes with any sides.As for dessert: I like the Duo Chocolate Tart (comes with Lavendar ice-cream)The service was above average especially Alex, he is very attentive and helpful
4
Great food, great service and great ambience!!! We ordered crabmeat pasta , truffle pasta , beef short ribs and the one kilo beef le beouf with 3 side dishes for 5 people. I must say we left the restaurant feeling satisfied!!
5
Get the lobster grilled cheese. Fully of lobster & cheesy goodness. You will be full for DAYS. Also topped it off with the bread pudding and some nice wine. Not a low-calorie meal, a true indulgence
5
Excellent ambience and friendly service. The converted chapel interior made for a very romantic date night. Lobster bisque starter was exquisite. Australian Wagyu main was done just right. Decided to try the house red which paired very well with both the bisque and steak. Baked Alaska dessert rounded off a fabulous meal
5
My partner and I were delightfully surprised by the excellent service and effort during our meal and a small gesture for the birthday boy. Overall delicious food and good ambience to dine in
5
Was recommended by my friend to try this restaurant for celebrating my wife's birthday. Mr Alex did a great job in assisting me with keeping my birthday cake and present on standby to give my wife a surprise. Will definitely come back for the food as well. Thanks once again Mr alex the restaurant manager
4
It was a lunch date with two friends. We ordered the lunch menu (3 course @ 42sgd). Good food. Good value for money. Lovely atmosphere. Will be bac
5
Wonderful atmosphere, very good service and delicious dish that makes me hungry the next day when I think of it. :) a good place to go for special occasion.
3
I went with my family having brunch. Food is average. Overall experience average. The poached egg only average. I don't think is value for money having spent about $200 on having average food.Staff service also average but atmosphere is very good.
4
Had a Sunday Brunch at White Rabbit, Superb environment!. However the food is good, but not impressed. Service is good, but may place more effort in sincerity
5
Went to White Rabbit to celebrate on girlfriend's birthday on Saturday night without an expectations because we didn't look at reviews about it and decided to go and see how things goes. We really liked it in the end because we love the food! The mains were to our taste, the dessert as well. The waiter and waitress were friendly and response to you very quickly. Though the prices can be on the steeper side, i'll still recommend people to give it a try
5
Food and services is very good except that the environment can be a little dark and noisy. Travelling to this place can be tedious
5
Enjoyable romantic dinner at The white rabbit. Excellent food and wine choice. Well worth the high price.
5
I brought my friend there for her birthday dinner. The staffs were very helpful and friendly,the food was soooooooo good. And also, the ambience was really really nice.
4
From reservation via chope from The White Rabbit website till the food quality and services, it was all awesome
5
The service was exceptional and the so was the food. Nice ambience for a date and just some chit chat. Will surely be back for more!
5
Will recommend to friend and familyMiss the Iberian Pork chop Service was good and like the atmosphere and very relax
5
We went to the white rabbit last sunday for dinner to celebrate my brother in law's birthday.We arrive a little bit early and proceeded to the rabbit hole their outdoor bar garden to take some photos first. It was very beautiful just what I heard it's like a wonderland. It's a gin bar, they got plenty of gin selection which serves with different kinds of garnishes and types of tonic water. They also got their own homemade tonic water, wow.We was assisted by Jessie on our way to our table for dinner and greeted by one of the manager alex upon seated. Gizelle and Anne gave the menu and introduced to us their signature dishes. We ordered lobster bisque which serve with half maine lobster and big burata to share for starters. Alaskan King Crab Tagliatelle, Iberian Pork Chop, 36hrs shortribs and the special for mains. All dishes was very good, portion just nice for what we paid for. Thanks to eva their manager that always checked with us whether we are enjoying everything and giving our needs. Won flambÃ© the baked alaska they even remembered my note about the birthday of my brother in law which they put a writings in his dessert. Su took a photo of us which we were surprised she gave us printed copy with message for a souvenir. Amazing.Overall it was a very wonderful experience. Thanks to The White Rabbit and for all the staff for this unforgettable experience. Thanks also to edwin who made a special mocktails for us. We will definitely coming back.
4
If you are looking for a place for lunch to impress and not too hard on the pocket, this is the place. Book in advance to avoid disappointment
5
The atmosphere of this restaurant is remarkable. Seated in a chapel and brunch wiz ur beloved one can be as sweet as u can imagine
4
Portion small for the price but overall was a good night. Thank you very much for a memorable evening.
4
The place have a nice deco and ambience, great for a romantic dates or girls gathering. Food taste is standard, but the service is top notc
5
Excellent service! The food was superb with big servings. Thank you to Eva, Jan, Gizelle and everyone for the awesome dining experience. I will definitely come back for another wonderful dining experience
4
The White Rabbit is housed in an old chapel, converted into this modern restaurant. The tall ceilings and roomy interiors add a certain intriguing character to the whole place. They have a great drinks menu, with some signature gin & tonic combos, and a decent selection of wines. For dinner, we had sauted foie gras for appetizer, black truffle grilled chicken (pre-ordered) for mains and banoffee pie for dessert. The quality of the food was consistently good. The service was on point and courteous.The restaurant felt a tad noisier for its size, maybe due to the high ceilings leading to echo, not sure. I liked the overall experience but wasnt overblown, hence the 4 stars - very good
5
Excellent service and food that is worth revisiting. They also have a wide variety of wine to choose from and to pair your food with. Would love to visit again
5
Ambience is excellent. My friend and i both enjoyed the starters, main course and desserts tremendously
3
I realize that the restaurant is occupying the place of an old chapel, and it made me feel uncomfortable. It is too big, too wide, too unoccupied. It is great for weddings or some special occasions, but friends dining together, no, not anymore. Everything I ordered- I liked. Not loved, just liked - it was Braised Pork Shoulder and a Cinnamon Cherry Parfait. It was just fine. The price is quite high just for a casual dining, so I won't be coming back
4
A little difficult to find but had ample car park at the time. The ambience was nice in an old chapel, nicely done with original mosaic floor. There was a good crowd. Food portions were quite large and was good. Service was very good. Will have to see what their dinner is like
5
The place provide excellent service and food which are worth going for. Will be going down again for other dishes
4
Was brought to our table directly upon arrival. Staff are extremely helpful and concern of the standards of the food.Food taste great as well. Wonderful experience!
5
Had alternate 5 course dinner. As gd as I last remembered it. Service was good and attentive.atmosphere was perfect
2
The service and ambience is worth the visit. Good for dating but the food is really mediocre. U can get better tasting equivalent food at 1/10 of the price elsewhere. The best food item I had was the free flow bread.
5
The food quality is good and the price is higher than most restaurant for brunch. the environment is very cosy!.
5
Went to this restaurant in febuary, atmosphere & ambience is nice. Food and service is fantastic or rather amesome. Staff is attentive towards customers. Best service for the staff. They will also recommend those food that is really sellable
4
We had the 5 course set menu. Excellent, particularly the Wagyu Carpaccio which was world class. Wine pairings were good but could have been sharper. The wine pairings got lost/were forgotten twice during the meal otherwise a very friendly and professional servic
5
Beautiful place although a little bit difficult to find. The service was excellent and the people were very friendly. Food wise, was a little disappointed that some of the dishes were already off the menu even thou it's only 2 pm. Other than that everything was perfect.
4
We had a great lunch over at the white rabbit. It was a birthday celebration. The food was good and delicious.
3
Had our girls date over brunch on a Saturday. We made our reservation before going as we heard it's always filled, and indeed it was. Service was prompt with smiles on all staffs. Food was served at a reasonable time. Sadly, the food was a disappointment. We had The Rabbit Fry Up, Egg Benedict, Burger and Carbonara. Food was not hot or cold when served. Taste was average and could find it easily in other restaurants. I will probably not visit again.
4
Went there for their set lunch as shared on their Chope menu but they didn't indicate that their lunch was only for weekdays in the menu :( The setting is gorgeous and would go back there for the environment and atmosphere! Food-wise is did not meet my expectations as I had high expectations for the flavors and it was a little basic. The eggs benedicts were NOT poached eggs but soft boiled eggs so the texture was off. Nevertheless, still a great place for cafe food and catch ups :
5
Tranquil place for lunch and catch-up with friends. Good value for set lunch menu. Excellent food quality
3
Came here to celebrate a special occasion but wasn't fully impressed. The service crew is definitely trained to handle in such restaurant setting and the entire environment of this place surely highly reviewed. The food on the other hand was just acceptable/mediocre. The price didn't justify the food presented on the table. We ordered the carbonara and the lobster sandwich. I would say the carbonara tasted pretty good. As for the lobster sandwich.. it was just bad.. The sandwich was sadly dry and hard, and the cheese cooling down on it just doesn't work in general, poor execution on the bread . In short, the meal was hard to take in so we didn't proceed with desserts
5
We came here for brunch and we love everything about this restaurant. The food was good, staff was attentive and the ambience is fantastic. Good selection of wine and yet it served free water. We ordered eggs Benedict, Lobster sandwich, fettuccine Carbonara and Wagyu Quarter pounder. Total bill was $120.
2
Nice architecture, poor interior, acceptable food but not outstandingly good, weak service. Overall no recommendatio
3
Menu is very basic and quality of the courses very average. A lot of buzz for this restaurant for nothing
4
First time here and I would say the real stand out for this place is the ambiance. The set lunch was fine without being outstanding and service was alright too.
3
Dug the menu off the Chope website/app - - thought they'd have set lunches on weekends but it didn't say weekdays only; we found out when we got there.Nonetheless, the weekend brunch menu looks pretty good. Weekend Brunch happens on weekends & Public Holidays, 10:30AM - 3:00PM. Wagyu Quarter Pounder ($28++) - Brioche bun, sauteed mushrooms, chips. Delicious juicy patty, but a little on the salty side. Left me quite thirsty thereafter. Fries were ok, not a fan of thick cut fries. Tomato & Grilled Pepper Stew ($24++) - a Basque classic, pair of baked eggs, sourdough bread. So sinful but so good. Bacon had "cut away"-able fats, which pleased me because I am OCD & do things like that. Eggs were delicious & the cheese + stew complimented it. I would order this again! Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats Accepts reservations - I used Chope WiFi available  Free parking available, but limited slot
5
We were greeted with efficient staff that showed us to our reserved table, we were also served immediately by the assigned waiter. Food came fast and the food was very good, in terms of quality and taste. The wine that the waiter recommended was also very nice to pair with our food. They also took note on the comment I put in the online reservation that I made, about our anniversary and decorated our dessert. It was a wonderful experience dining there and will definitely go back again!
4
The atmosphere was fantastic. The food were fantastic! Overall was a fastastic experience. We've ordered the three course set lunches.. enough variety to choose from. Tried the tuna, aparagus truffles, organise chicken, lobster pasta and the chocolate dessert
5
This is my 2nd time having brunch at The White Rabbit and was looking forward to having the Lobster Cheese Sandwich and Seafood Pot Pie once again. Needs to say both the food and service did not disappoint and lived up to our expectations. Definitely a go-to destination for a great brunch experience
4
We had been recommended to have a drink at The Rabbit Hole so we decided to have a cocktail prior to our dinner. The gin based cocktail was good so the evening started off well. I had booked dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday so we had a nice booth for our seating. My husband decided he wanted the 5 course degustation menu. We had brought a special bottle of wine to celebrate and corkage was $35 per bottle so that was all fine. We started with a trout tartare which was light and fresh. It was then followed by foie gras which I have to say was probably the best dish of the night (simply delicious). We then had crab tagliatelle which was a little disappointing as the pasta probably could have had a little more cooking and the crab meat was hardly seen, however the broth was very flavoursome. We then had the 36 hour cooked short ribs which I liked but my husband was disappointed as they didn't really fall apart. Dessert was crepes suzette for hubby (cooked at the table) and caramel banoffee tart for me. Both were delicious. So the evening was lovely, good service, food was flavour some but the cost was definitely on the high end, so it is not an everyday restaurant and whilst food was good, nothing exceptional except maybe the foie gras
5
Had an Anniversary Lunch at the White rabbit and their service was top notch. They even took a photo of us and printed it out on the spot for us. 11/10 service/food/ambience was very good as well. Would totally come back here
5
We tried the set lunch. Found a great atmosphere in a classic bulding The service was attentive and spot on. The choices on the set lunch were great and food was well presented and delicious. Will try again for dinner
5
Booked in for the 3 course set lunch on Vday. I loved that they included vegetarian options in their menu without me needing to ask for special dietary requirements! The food was delicious and the servers were all very polite and efficient.The interior is a little dark which makes it not so great for photo taking, and the music played in the restaurant could have been a little suited to the ambience of the place. We requested one of the staff to take photos for us outside and he did it wonderfully for us. Would definitely be back again
4
Good food and atmosphere. Would definitely have loved to experience dinner service as well! Recommend to everyone
1
Service & atmosphere was alright. But the food is not up to standard. The pasta that I ordered is tasteless. And the pasta is hard not even al-Dante
4
Unique food, great experience. Dining tables were slightly too close, lack of privacy especially for valentine's day.
5
As the restaurant was fully booked on valaentines day we decided to celebrate and book a week in advance . The experience was worth the one week advance booking
4
Apart from making customers feel at home, the preordered Truffle Roasted Chicken was flavourful and the sauce complimented the meat well!
3
Nice ambiance, friendly service but mediocre food. It was 2pm and was informed they were sold out on the lobster sandwich and fish dish. Then ordered the medium done wagu burger and was informed after the order was put in, that it was also sold out! Asked to speak to the manager and we magically had the orders filled. Food arrived, wagu burger was well done....disappointed...
4
I made reservations for my girlfriend's birthday surprise dinner and it was awesome. The place was lovely, although a tad noisy when it was full. I indicated in my reservation that it was for a birthday so we were given the sofa corner seats which was very comfy. We ordered the baby carrots and the wagyu beef. Love the baby carrots but the wagyu beef was a tad overcooked at medium rare. The dou chocolate tart came with birthday wordings. Chocolate tart was very good as the chocolate was intense and not too sweet. It was an added bonus to have a picture taken and printed for us as keepsake for a lovely dinner.
4
Their service was great and the food ordered (lobster grilled cheese sandwich and roast of the day), it were yummy! Add on with mac and cheese with mushroom
4
Very excited to finally manage to reserve a table at The White Rabbit.Despite hearing mixed reviews about the food, we had a very good experience. Food was exceptional (we ordered the lobster bisque soup, wagyu carpaccio, truffle chicken for mains and the banofee pie for dessert). Service and ambience was perfect for a romantic weekend dining experience
4
The atmosphere and food is good enough for couples and celebration. Love the garden at the back of the restaurant
2
Both the lobster grilled cheese and the the roasts of the day(bangers and mash) that we had were unsatisfactory
5
Though i had the 4-course dinner menu, however it was very filling. My girlfriend and i love the Foie Gras as it melts near-immediately upon putting into the mouth. The Crepe Suzette showmanship is very interesting too! I will like to thank the Rabbits of both service team & kitchen team for the impeccable food & service! Thank you! Will definitely come back again
5
The venue is just beautiful, and their prix fixe menu is on point. Overall very pleasurable experience. The restaurant is also very accommodating to requests.
4
The lobster bisque was heavenly. Short ribs are highly recommended too. Service staff was very attentive and made the dining experience very lovel
3
The ambience needs some work on the lighting: the daytime glare from the window is disturbing. Interior lighting could have been brighter to off-set the glare. We had the 3-course lunch which was good; but the prix-fixe menu was uninspiring and over-priced.Wines: good selection of unusual bottles
4
White Rabbit has found the perfect hole. I'm amazed by how it managed to secure the Harding Road location in Dempsey - it's an absolutely beautiful experience dining in an old chapel. I can understand why it's such a popular place for weddings.The food and service was great too, though a tad pricey. We had the Lobster Bisque and Wagyu beef. The bisque was so rich in flavour with huge chunks of lobster to bite on. Overall, it was a memorable visit and would be extremely romantic for a couple's night out
4
We had set lunch in this army chapel converted to modern dining restaurant. Very peaceful surrounding. Good selection of starters and mains choices for the set lunch. My wagyu Carpaccio was a delight though my friend thought it was a bit fatty. Our crab meat pasta was slightly overwhelmed by the pork broth that was served together. The star of the day is the salmon trout,unfortunately it was listed as trout on the menu. So two out of three of us did not choose that thinking it was a trout dish. Luckily my friend who ordered that let us have a taste and it was absolutely delicious. Dessert of cherry parfait and millefeuille with strawberries were also great. Our initial glasses of house pinot grigio was less than fresh,but we were offered another round with a new bottle and that was good. Service was friendly
4
Good atmosphere and inviting experience for my lunch experience at the white rabbit. Food are serve good and the service are warmth. Will visit for lunch and dinner again
5
The place is very romantic and food was outstanding. Don't forget to try the broad variety of gin bar..
5
I used the restaurant for my friend's birthday. Good atomosphia, good service, nice food, we enjoyed too much.
5
The ambience was romantic and the staff was attentive.The menu offered a good selection and the food was very well done in terms of presentation and quality. We are already planning to come back.
3
We started of the night with some great gins at the bar (The Rabbit Hole), followed by fantastic appetiser. But, mains were not so good, front of house staff were great. I would definitely recommend the Burrata, but stay away from the crab linguine, we had to send it back twice. The mains were average. Front of House staff were the right amount of attentive and very sweet. Ambience and lighting were perfect
5
It's really value for money. Not to mention the romantic ambience and historic atmosphere. You will like never leaving. The chef serves you personally, cutting the meat in front of you makes your mouth water. Great wine selection and very professional staff
4
I took my wife there for our anniversary and was not disappointed, the staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome. We had the beef ribs and the pork chop, both were very well prepared and of a high standard. Portion size was also good. The menu is pricey but we found it was backed up with satisfying meal quality and size.The only down side was the alcohol was quite expensive and the lighting was a little to dim.We would recommend and will be back again for a special occasion
3
We were disappointed with the Wagyu quarter pounder, we thought we had ordered something from the kids menu. The lobster sarnie stole the show, and the salmon blinis were pretty average. The surroundings were nice and they had good music playing nonetheless
4
Celebrated my 6 year Anni at the White Rabbit. Definitely the best dinner date place that I have had with my gf within the last 6 years. Let's get the only bad thing out of the way first. THE LOCATION IS INSANELY INCONVINIENT. Nearest mrt was at Botanic Garden Station and even that is far to walk. Had to take a cab all the way into some secluded area where the resteraunt was at. So if u are not driving, don't bother walking. Just take a cab. But definitely worth it.First of all we ordered a Wagyu Steak (65$) and a Alaskan King Crab Pasta (46$) with a side of Truffle Mac and Cheese (14$) and a Chocolate Tart desert (14$). While waiting for the main course to arrive we were served fantastic and awesome bread like Basil mini bagel like bread with butter. Just the bread alone was so good already we had to resist taking a third piece. The Steak was cooked perfectly Medium and it was so tender and tasted great with the truffle sauce. Even my gf who is normally picky about her tenderness of the steak had no complains. Every mouth of the pasta felt like I was sucking the Essence of the Crab and drinking its soul. It was that fantastic. Best Crab pasta in my life. Although I felt that the pasta noodles was abit on the undercooked side but that's a personal preference. The Mac and Cheese was so awesome as wel with the delightful Truffle seasoning and mushroom bits in it. Though we didn't finish it as we were too full.The Choc tart came with its own side of handmade Lavander ice cream which was interesting. The crunch of the choc tart base perfectly evens out the rich chocolate filling of the tart. Overall the food was fantastic, the atmosphere of a old chapel converted was so romantic. The service staffs were so friendly and dedicated. Definitely a must to try and I would even recommend making this into a regular date place haha.
5
Super worthy of the price! they made our anniversary really special! will be definitely coming back agai
4
I had the chance to come here for a drink. What a homey, cosy place to be at. Felt like I was in a country side.Nice and friendly waiters, very servicing. It is nice to know that Singapore has a place for us to escape from downtown to a 'suburb' like area, peace and quiet little place.The resto is in building like a large house or outside with garden around. Perfect for a private party.Drinks and food were just right for me. Good for chill out
5
Everything surprises me especially She removed fish bones in front me before serving me & he cook dessert right in front of me before serving me on the spot while I'm able to enjoy the dessert while it's still hot.
4
Excellent meal but choice of starter and wine not available Both lobster bisque and Australian red wine first choice not available
1
Completely agree with the negative reviews here. The venue is great - converted church. Has a wow factor when you walk in. Then you get hit with the horrible service. Yikes. Like stepping into a Ferrari then realising the engine is crap & the seats are plastic. We sat down at 8pm to be told that 2 of the 6 main courses (the sole and the steak) were not available. What kind of kitchen plans like that? Then 2 of the red wines I ordered were also not available. Great start. Appetisers took 30min (from ordering) to get out. They were ok but definitely overpriced. Then we waited a further 1hr before the manager finally admitted to us that the kitchen had forgotten our order. We had enough of the incompetence and walked out. It was now almost 10pm. We went to PS Cafe for a late dinner. Service was a shamble. Management had no idea what was going on. This was a special occasion meal (which they were made of early on). There are some great restaurants in SG so don't waste your time & $ on this place. It used to be good but now living on its laurels and the uniqueness of the venue

Food was alright. Service was excellent. Prepared bday surprise and it was well managed. Very impressed.
2
Very average, flat, forgettable place...Great location and interior. But that doesn't cut it.Poor, ordinary food, slightly tired staff. Overall I know too many people who have never returned.I am joining that group now

My first time to White Rabbit and I'm so amazed by the attention they gave to us. We had a great time and we had Burrata, Steak, Mac&Cheese, Riesling tea & Duo Choc tart. The food is awesome & not just that, the service is great. We really enjoyed ourselves and there ain't a chance for us to worry about anything. Will DEFINITELY go back again, thank you! Lastly, i did not expect that they will celebrate my fiancÃ©e's birthday as there wasn't any reply from my reservation note. But they did, so was quite surprised by it. Thank you once again! Amazing

The location and ambience of The White Rabbit is great. It makes you feel like you're out of Singapore. As for the food and price paid, I've had better. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and the Waffles with Berries Compote. The Eggs were alright but definitely enjoyed the Waffles. There was a lot of compote and that might not be for everyone. Was super tang
3
The place is an old cathedral , so spacious and high ceilings. When I went it felt like a date place. Menu is not very varied and priced at the top end . They were out of two menu items when we were there. Presentation of the food was not to bad with service being very good. Wine menu also not very large and priced at the top end. Has a nice bar area at the back which could be fun. Make them book you a taxi back as not easy at night time to get a taxi.So came away feeling so so on this place.
5
I made a reservation for two (my boyfriend and I) at The White Rabbit to kickstart his birthday weekend and both of us left the place feeling more than satisfied. Customer service was great from start to finish; the staff are all well trained and polite, something that makes or breaks the entire experience and we both feel that our experience was made. We ordered two mains (White Rabbit Fry-Up, Grilled Cheese Lobster Sandwich) and one side (Truffle Mac & Cheese with Mushrooms) together with two drinks (Bettina, Penelope). The waiting time is longer than average but you get to have all your food served together all at once, perfect for intimate gatherings and for those with the habit of waiting for all food to arrive before digging in. The ambience was perfect for a Saturday brunch too! Great experience overall
5
Great service! Didn't charge me for birthday dessert and a pot of tea. The dessert came with a candle too
5
excellent recommendations from staffs. very friendly staffs. nice environment. suitable for family gathering, couples and business.
4
Not much really can beat good food in a good ambience, and having dinner in an old church certainly is up there. The service is also great and the menu is varied enough with a good long wine list. For birthday celebrations, the restaurant also takes the effort to capture the memory by taking a picture and presenting it to us after dinner. Will certainly come back again
5
Had our anniversary lunch here and it's best to reserve in advance for a table. Great service, and the food was amazing. Would define go back
4
Very good personalised service, good food and good wine match offer.It was for New Year's Eve with friends visiting from abroad and we had a great time there
4
Nice food and ambience. Service staff polite. Like my lobster cheese sandwich, boyfriend's wagyu beef burger a tad dry
5
The White Rabbit never seems to fail at all occasions I'm there. From the elegant and romantic decor to the food and the surroundings, this place amazes and impresses
4
brunch with a nice atmosphere But the food was totally average with the price we paid for. Service was above average though
5
Food was nice. The surroundings as well. The service was great! The side dishes was very tasty. We had the asperagus and the french fries. One tip on the asperagus, maybe nice to serve the sauce on the side instead of pouring it on top. But food was great
2
Few choice of starters, no vegetable. 49$ for kids menu and no choice of meal for them! My kids are only bread. Very expensive for that.
5
Good food, good environment. Friendly staff. well organised and there is no confusion of food delivery esp when we were in a big group ordering different food
4
My wife and I visited the White Rabbit for our Christmas Eve dinner. This is probably the third time we had patronised this restaurant.We had booked the 5 course set dinner. The dishes were all well presented, in small servings and leave you craving for more. The building's decor, with its dim lighting, set for a romantic venue. But it can get quite noisy when crowded.Overall we enjoyed the dinner. Service was prompt and efficient.We must had been quite hungry that day as we adjourned to another restaurant in the area for a second supper
5
Very nice ambient, great food and superb service. Really enjoyed my dinner there. All service staff are so friendly and attentive. Fish and Rib both tasted so nice
4
Went with my parents upon friend's recommendation. Foie Gras was the best I've ever had. Not sure truffle and chicken was the best combination. Neither was crab meat and tagliatelle, which tasted a bit too strong. Unlimited bread and tap water and service was very impressive. Overall good atmosphere and service, but for a very hefty price I'd expect better food than what was served
5
What a great restaurant, we started with pre dinner drinks and I had a G&T and low and behold they make their own Tonic which has to tasted to be believed, the best G&T ever. We then had a dinner function for about 40 people and the meal was superb, and they catered for all our needs, including our Vegetarian and Gluten free guests. This is a top spot for dinne
5
The White Rabbit is housed in a decommissioned chapel, which gives it an ambience of peace in the midst of busy Singapore. Muted lighting adds to the atmosphere. Service was good, with the waitstaff being very polite and unobtrusive, appearing quietly to serve a little more wine or to top up your glass of wine.For starters we had the Classic Lobster Bisque, which came with half a lobster, and their signature Truffle en Croute, a truffle broth with diced truffle and foie gras. Both were very good, although I must say that my wife who had the bisque probably had the better dish. The bisque was full of flavour without being overly heavy. We both had the Grilled Iberian Pork Chop, which was tender and juicy. The only miss was the charred romaine hearts, which were too salty. The wine list was pretty extensive and for a restaurant like this, the markups were fairly reasonable in price. Overall the meal was excellent and would recommend the place.
4
20th wedding anniversary. Lovely venue (old church). Nice wine and food.Service started off well but towards end we were forgotten, no offer of desert menu till i asked after sitting 10min, no offer of coffee. Pretty disappointing end to the evening
4
Location is perfect for business lunch with good service and food. Set lunch offers good value for money.
3
The food was really good and the so were the Gin drinks. The entry level red, Malbec was a good dropBut it's just overpriced. I mean 4 of us spent $700!! Jesus H Christ!! I mean that's insane isn't it?Our taxi took forever to find the car park...in the end he gave up but we were 3rd time luckyNot in a rush to go bac
5
The food was awesome, the staffs were great too! Some of my team mates were first time there and were really impressed with everything
1
Their website mentionned a brunch menu until 3pm. We got turned down upon our arrival at 2pm sharp as it was already "past the last order". Seriously ??? No mention on the website or wherever. What a way to treat potential customers - especially when the restaurant is in the middle of nowhere so taxis or long walks are needed to reach..
3
Food is expensive and tastes mediocre. Ambience is unique. Service is good. Overall, I would hardly want to return to White Rabbit.
5
White rabbit never fails to please with the food choices and impeccable service. Everything around the table was a great choice, and definitely a repeater. Prices aren't super cheap but definitely worth your while. The beautiful chapel also makes for a great atmosphere
3
Wer arrived in time, had to wait ages fro drinks orders, then for main orders and even longer fro the food. The staff never cleared empty things off the table unless we handed them to them. A little more 'get up and go', energy and smiles.... Waiting is understandable sometimes when the food is good and it's peak period, but the dining experience in thsi instance relies on switched-on staff.
5
The service was great. The food was wonderful, delicious and expertly done. A very nice and cosy setting
5
I brought my godfamily out for a nice sunday brunch and were not disappointed by the food and ambience. Our reserved table was ready for seating just in time at our moment of entry, and the waitress was at hand to serve our menus and refill waters. She could sense whether we needed space or wanted help with our orders, attentive whenever we gestured to her for table service. The madeleines accompanied by lemon curd sauce are a definite must try, and their truffle fries were delightfully served with real truffle slices. The brische salad did not disappoint and the main course portions were generous. I would recommend the lobster sandwich. Would go again just for their madeleines
5
It was good food albeit pricey but that is to be expected with such a restaurant. The steak with red wine was very good! (Definitely recommend). The ambience was also unparalleled when compared to most other restaurants
3
Location not so accessible unless you drive or take a cab. Yes you can take the public bus there but you have to walk a little bit. The price is decent, Food is just ok. A good place to impress your date if you are looking into taking her to a unique place
5
We were there to for my belated birthday dinner and had the 4 course dinner with wine pairing. Everything tasted so good! The service was impeccable too
3
Came here for the lunch but didn't realise they only had brunch on Sundays. Service and ambience was good. But the brunch menu was quite limited. The salami was not fresh and had a strong oily taste. Would come back again to try the lunch or dinner
5
Eating in a fairy tale might sound strange, but The White Rabbit delivers on all fronts. Feeling like the Mad Hatter at his Tea Party, the tea is not the only thing to be raving about as the total experience, from service, quality of food, to the ambience, hits all the right spots. Curiouser and Curiouser as to how they are able to maintain the consistent standard with every visit. Never grows old...much like the tale that inspired it
5
My husband and I just celebrated our 1 year wedding anniversary at The White Rabbit. They were absolutely amazing - the service was on point, the food was outstanding and the atmosphere was perfect. We cannot thank The White Rabbit enough for making this night so special. We highly recommend it!!
2
I was out with a group of friends after a Sunday jog and we decided to go to white rabbit for brunch. How disappointed we were, the food was cold and the service was terribly slow. To top it all off the left the table check in one of my friends dishes! I won't be going back in a hurry. A real shame as we had heard great reviews.
4
Been here twice and the staff have been very friendly and the service timely. One negative is that the lifting is very dim. It makes it hard to see what you're eating and in one part of the restaurant, where there's a step, people are constantly tripping over. A bit more light won't spoil the ambience!
1
Oysters cause diarrhoea. Their phone number does not work properly. Atmosphere was bad. Awful hot chocolate and mediocre gin tonic. Really horrendous experience for a birthday dinner
4
Ate for a work dinner with colleagues. Drinks outside in the garden first were lovely. We all had the 4 course set menu. Good food, but a long wait between courses 1&2. Tried to find a waiter to ask, nobody around. Braised short ribs just ok, and as a bannoffee "expert", I was disappointed with dessert. Overall a nice experience though, reasonably priced bottle of wine, and my guests loved it.
4
We had dinner at this place with a group of friends one night and very much enjoyed it. Dempsey Hill is a great neighborhood in Singapore and the White Rabbit is one of the coolest places. Absolutely loved the designâ€¦.food was excellent, we shared many plates and everything tasted great. The wine selection was very good and reasonably prices and service was attentive and fast.We would definitely be back again
5
The White Rabbit is such a pretty restaurant - refurbished church with clean lines and lots of light through the stained glass. The food was also excellent. Great special occasion dining.
5
Always wanted to visit the place but never got to. The wait was worth it. Food and service was great
5
Service staff are very attentive and friendly. Portion was just nice for 3 course lunch. Wagyu beef carpaccio was really good and so was the Challans duck breast.
2
Let's just say the food wasn't poor, but they didn't exactly live up to standards and tasted really normal - something which I can find elsewhere with a lower price tag. I've experienced the decline in food quality over the past 4 yrs and this time was the worst, probably wouldn't visit again anytime soon. And one more thing: my husband was in the loo with a male employee and didn't witness him washing his hands before leaving the loo. Whether he washed them before handling anything else... well that left us to our imagination and we certainly kept a close eye on who served our food/drinks
5
My wife and I went for a weekend brunch. Located along the road to Dempsey Hill with its own rustic carpark, the White Rabbit is easily accessible by car. Will be back for dinner one evening
3
Oysters were fresh and good but not amazing. Barrata was tasty, but presentation was lacking. Crab pasta tasted good, but was kind of soupy. Under normal expectations, the meal would have been a good meal, but we had higher expectations based on the reviews and hype. Overall, good experience, however we will not likely be back until we have tried the other options in Singapore.
3
-Tableside food that are not served tableside. - Mediocre food quality.- Mediocre service - Asked to be seated at a nice spot in the reservation for birthday celebration made a week earlier, only to be seated right in front of the toilet. I asked for a switch but was told the other tables are reserved. But for some reasons, those tables stayed empty the whole night
3
We asked for a high chair when we booked a table. It came with a full set of kids bowl, spoon and folk. However, when we asked for another set for my 4-year-old, the services seems drop suddenly! Only one folk and one knife were provided. We needed to ask bowl and spoon many times before they were willing to provide! Not quite sure why!
4
First time to White Rabbit with spouse. Great experience. Attentive staff. Pre-ordered the roasted black truffle chicken which was a good choice, though a little salty after a few more bites. Lobster bisque tasted fantastic with half a lobster in the soup. Overall great dining experience. Might consider bringing our kids along for brunch in future as the restaurant seemed to be family friendly as well
3
The service there is not up to our expectation. We waited very long for our starter, other tables which came later than us were served before us. Our soup were served only after we checked with the waitress. The lobster bisque and Alaskan king crab pasta taste very very salty. Only the desserts are nice
5
Brought the family here for a slow Saturday brunch. Ambience was great, food was wonderful and service standards high. The kids' mac and cheese order was an unexpected surprise. It impressed us with a great sauce with mushrooms and truffles; although the kid was disappointed with its portion size. Other kid ordered a candied bacon waffle which had a nice crunch outside but fluffy inside. Thumbs up!The wife had a lobster cheese sandwich, which boasted a good well-flavoured crunchy bread. What impressed me most was the egg benedict. It had no vinegared aftertaste prevalent in many dining establishments. It looked to me more like eggs done sou vide style. It was perfectly presented with soft but well coagulated egg white with a supremely custard yolk. Most of the entrees came with a side of salad. I will surely be back to try their other menu offerings!This venue is great for anniversaries/birthdays/special occasions, given that prices here are notexactly what you would spend on everyday dining. But service standards are certainly high with staff being very attentive and prompt. Plus the high ceilings and stained glass windows will add to the magic of the special occasion that you are celebrating there.
5
The white rabbit is located in a beautiful church complete with stain glass windows. It also has easy parking and is surrounded by pleasant greenery. The set lunch menu is good value for money. Location is a little removed from the mess of Orchard Road and the CBD which is a plus for me
4
Portions were generous, and the ambience is undisputed. The service was excellent, we celebrated a birthday and the surprise candlelit dessert was an ease to arrange. An instant printout of a group photo of us celebrating was a lovely touch
5
This place looked amazing from all I'd read and seen online, and it was. The setting, a converted chapel on a quiet (it's true!) side street near the botanical gardens was unique, and I was excited to try the 3 course lunch menu.Neither of us tried, though we gawked at the truffled asparagus - I chose a refreshing, solid yellowfin tuna sashimi dish, and my wife had a wagyu carpaccio that she said was one of the highlights of our entire trip. The king crab pasta was delicious, as was the cinnamon cherry parfait for dessert. At $32 USD plus $8 for the wine, it was well priced as well.My wife is a gin drinker, and had lots of choices from their specialty drink menu filled with that spirit, and they also offered a glass of wine with the lunch for $10 that was a perfect pairing
5
Went there to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday, booking was easy via online. Nice ambience, cosy place with friendly staffs
5
Excellent service and very attentive staff. Food was amazing and super tasty. Love the way how the chef mix and match different ingredients together.
5
What a fantastic dining experience - stunning gin cocktails on the terrace followed by one of the most flavoursome meals I've ever tasted. The fois gras & carpaccio starters were delicious, the waghu steaks cooked perfectly & we loved the truffles on the frites & mac & cheese. Great service topped off a dinner to remember. Thank you
5
Excellent service and delicious food to match. Love the unique gin cocktail created by the bartender.
5
I first had a taste of the White Rabbit almost a decade ago. This interesting concept of a restaurant is located in the Dempsey Hill districts where many gastronomic adventures reside. Housed in a restored old chapel, The White Rabbit will bring you to another world with its 'Alice in Wonderland' concept. Just like the potion from the original novel, it even has an outdoor bar with a "Drink Me" motif
4
Resisted patronising The White Rabbit even though we lived in the neighbourhood as the food was not highly rated. This obviously is ancient history and the food now is excellent. This is a place that is very popular for Sunday brunch amongst families and working crowd in the evenings on weekdays.The noise level can be daunting and the trick is to go a little later on week nights as by 9:30 the crowd thins out and the noise level drops. As it is a former chapel converted to a restaurant, the acoustics is not the best for a quiet evening.Service is friendly and efficient and they are eager to please. The food is excellent. The evening prior to dinning at The White Rabbit we had dinner at one of the newly awarded Michelin Star restaurants. At the end of the meal my husband and I said nearly simultaneously "White Rabbit is so much better."The food is unpretentious and delicious. When we had brunch there service was friendly even though we had to wait for our food as they were very full. Well cooked and everyone at our table was happy with their order.Will definitely return as well as do more entertaining at this establishment
4
If you want to impress your guests or date, this is the place to dine. The restaurant is housed in a chapel and the decoration makes you feel really special
5
It was my first visit to the white rabbit for my girlfriend's birthday. The place, ambience, food and service crew were excellent. I will definitely visit again :
5
The place is inside and very old church and the inside atmosphere is very retro feel. Classic bar and furniture is a perfect match to the building. I had my very best lobster bisque in my entire life. Both our main course taste so good with the seasoning that's perfect. The fish is nicely served with the fish bones removed at your table. The 36 hours short rib is soft and tender.
5
Service was prompt, very attentive staff and efficient as well. Perfect ambience for a special occasion or even for individuals looking for food that's a league above the common ones. Outdoors are perfect for chilling and talks over drinks. Definitely recommend my friends to White Rabbit.
4
The service was good but not enough variety on their menu. Maybe it's becos it was on a Sunday. Overall food was o
5
Good atmosphere. Great service. Just too expensive and location a bit out. Try the lobster bistro - super tasty
2
As part of my bday celebration, we went to white rabbit since it supposed to be one of the best brunch place in Singapore. But sorry mate, this doesn't turn out anything as we expected. The service was excellent no doubt. First, our food arrived in different times. Second, there are still water on our champagne glasses (please dry it before serve). And our food were half warm half cold (we ordered white rabbit fry up and egg Benedict with Parma ham) , I needed to send back to mine because it was too cold. White rabbit fry up aka full English breakfast, the sausages were horrible and eggs were undercooked. It's overrated for sure, will not come back again!
5
My wife brought me here for our anniversary dinner, and what an underrated restaurant! The gin cocktails are the best I've ever had
4
Went there for a first date, impressed by the whimsical and romantic decor and ambience. The outdoor garden with lights was beautiful. Service was attentive. Food could be better but still decent.
5
I came with my wife for the wedding anniversary, the food and service were great! it was an awesome experience! Thanks White Rabbit
4
We were looking for a special place for an anniversary and that's a great one. Beautiful and pleasant outdoor for the cocktail, they serve paté, saucisson, duck breast as for apéro which is tasty and then dinner location is not a small intimate place but still nice. A bit pricy for red meat but not worst than any place in Singapore for a good piece. Burrata was excellent and the truffle starter quite amazing too. Chocolate dessert really good even is no more space after the main course! Staff is nice and helpful. We'll come back ;
5
The view outside the restaurant is really great, and we liket the environment inside the restaurant so much. The food are great as well, esp the truffle pasta we ordered.
2
Beautiful restaurant but everything else about it was really disappointing. Firstly we were told that their signature dish, which we had planned on having, was sold out (8pm and not busy). We then had to wait ages for them to actually take our order. When the food came, the crispy Alfonsino at $34 was the smallest portion I have ever seen! (About the size of a piece of sushi! ) We also ordered the pork chop and was warned that it came medium well done! ..... I always believed that pork has to be cooked properly in order to avoid the risk of getting sick! The staff were unfriendly and the service was slow.Great shame
3
I was here with my fiancee for her birthday. We ordered 2 sets of 5 courses dinner with an additional lobster bisque for sharing. The dinner costed me SGD $367.22. We came here because one of my good friend had her wedding lunch here. The staff here were very cheerful and friendly. As requested, we got a table in the far corner at the back as well as the birthday deco on the dessert. They also helped us took a picture and printed out for us. Lovely service. Ambience was great, but unfortunately half way through the dinner, we encountered a power blackout. The situation was resolved rather fast and the service crew promptly apologised to each table. However, I was rather disappointed by the food. I had great expectation for such a hyped-up restaurant. Trout tartare was nicely presented. The bisque was really too salty for our liking. We literally had to cleanse our palates by downing cups of Pellegrino. Sautéed foie gras was really tender and tasty (the only dish that was up to my expectation). The proportion of the starch dish - tagliatelle was rather small and it was rather salty. The short rib was okay. The dessert was passable. My fiancee liked her carpaccio and fish though. I won’t say it was a disappointing experience.
5
White rabbit never fail to satisfy my dining experience. Good service, cozy & quiet ambiance, and nice food, the only thing which needed improvement is the coffee. Ordered 2 latte and we are disappointed, put aside the cafe art, the there is no aroma and taste
4
The best Roasted Truffle chicken I ever had! I am a person who dislike chicken breast but the half roasted truffle chicken from The White Rabbit was OMGee! I never tasted such a tender half chicken before! The sauce was very flavorful also! Other than the accessibility, the rest were excellent!
5
Fantastic food excellent,service exceptional and ambience restful in lovely building I would unreservedly recommend this restaurant to anyon
4
Wine was good but abit pricey , food was not bad . However , service is only average . Ambience not bad
4
The White Rabbit took in my request very seriously! they even remembered small things like writing a little message beside my boyf's bday cake.the servers were friendly and professional. thank you for the wonderful experience. :
5
Delightful evening with my media friends! Lobster bisque was delicious & the crepes out of this world.
4
Food (ordered set menu), wine and ambience was good, including good service. Nearby parking could be better lit as it was dim and not sheltered (inconvenient on a rainy day). Still, a recommended place for special occasions.
4
The atmosphere is positive and inviting. Service is good and attentive, knowledgeable personnel and helpful even though they were very busy on a Saturday evening. From the good we ordered, the best were the lobster bisque and the beef rib which was well cooked and tender. The disappointing items were the pork belly was too fatty in taste and the rack of lamb which could had been cooked longer for medium level.
5
the service was perfect. The lady who served us took really good care of us and the manager was really thoughtful. It was a great experience

I wish to share my experience which happened on 28 Aug 2016 as it was my daughter's birthday. I was trying my best to book for dinner from the day before but couldn't get an confirmation. Luckily, my email was replied by Ms Andrea who responded and got me a reservation. Thank you Andrea for your prompt reply. At dinner, we started up with vegetable soup, lobster bisque and smoked foie gras with duck breast. The bisque and foie gras as no words to express...wonderful superb marvellous. As for the main, we had Alaskan King Crab Tagliatelle, pumpkin risotto and lamb rack together with sides - fried cauliflower, mac & cheese with mushrooms. The lamb rack as recommended by their staff was half done but frankly we felt as if raw meat was served to us. It was really very hopeless, we could not even eat a small slice. We told the waiter to cook it a little longer but it arrived the same. The blacken lamb was left untouched. As for the pastas, here again no words to express....we were really happy to have ordered those. Fried cauliflower and the mac & cheese were okay.There were a few birthdays being celebrated like the waiters dish out desert from their trolley but what upset me the most was....when I did the reservation I informed on my email that we are there for my daughter's birthday and yet she was not even given a scoop of ice cream on the house. I am not asking for them to cook up a desert from their trolley which I can afford to pay for if I am told earlier. I have spent almost $300 plus and ordering a desert for her will not cost me much (actually we were already full) but what sadden me most was to see my daughter's disappointed face on her birthday. Maybe the management don't practice that.....then it was my first visit and will be my last.......i don't wish to disappoint any of my love ones anymore especially on their special occasion
3
Ambience and service was great, but the brunch we had was mediocre. Scrambled eggs were close to room temperature and the poached egg on our carbonara was barely runny. Expected alot more from the hype.
4
Thoroughly enjoyed my visit - worked really well for a business lunch. Prompt and attentive service, interesting venue, easy to get to and from - and my food was excellent. Grilled octopus starter was unusual and delicious, and the pan fried barramundi was also very tasty. No problem with noise - easy to chat at our table.Thumbs up. I will be back
5
The white rabbit not only offers amazing food, but also an artistic decoration. Once a church, the white rabbit has maintained the rustic feeling of an old church while blending it into the modern style all teenagers love. A delicious favorite among the many different types of food is the Mac and cheese, which has tiny flakes of biscuit on top a layer of thick cheese. Under is melted cheese combined with tiny macaroni. Besides that, I came here on my sister's birthday. They offered to take a family photo for us and even printing it out with a (secret) message on the back. Hope to see you there!!!

I went with my husband for his birthday to White Rabbit. It is indeed a lovely venue. The staff were courteous and attentive, which we appreciated a lot, especially on a Saturday evening. We both chose the 4 course prix fixe menu, which had a nice range of French style dishes. My husband found many of his dishes to be on the saltier side (the scallops, the beef tartare, and pork belly). I ordered the salad with avocado sauce and found that the vinaigrette/avocado sauce to be too mild for the bitterness of the greens. It was a passable bistro salad at best, and for the price and portion a bit disappointing. I enjoyed the sauteed foie gras, but again fine for a bistro but I expected a bit more for fine dining. The Japanese sea bream as the main dish was solid, but again not special. The desserts (crepes suzette and cheesecake) were quite nice. I expected more from White Rabbit given the ambience, reviews, and price. It was a lovely evening, but I probably wouldn't return based on the quality of the food alone (even if the prices were less expensive)
3
I had a two course set lunch. The appetizer was good and delicious but I was shock at the main course portion. Only one small rib!Pathetic looking
4
Friend's birthday dinner was held here and space was, it was great for a big group. It may be something in the structure but voices seemed to bounce off the walls making it hard to hear the person sitting across from you. It wasn't until later in the evening that it got better.Food was really fresh and flavoursome. The wagyu carpaccio melted in your mouth and coupled with the truffle, it was memorable. The Japanese sauteed sea bream was ordinary in comparison to the short ribs which was done really well
5
This review comes a few months late. Was here for my birthday dinner and it was pretty good! First up, the restaurant has a lovely interior and is great for an intimate dinner with your partner or with good friends. Service was prompt, efficient and discreet. As for the food, it was perfect. We had the foie gras for starters. For the mains, I had the pork belly, while my partner had the dover sole. They were all excellent, paired with a lovely glass of wine

It's been on my bucket list for some time now to go to the White Rabbit for a meal (this was my 10th trip to Singapore in July). So made sure I did it this time. Firstly, we couldn't get through to make a reservation so I asked the concierge at the hotel we were staying at to see if he could book it for us. Thankfully he managed to get through and booked a Sunday lunch / brunch for my girlfriend and I. We were expecting fine dining and was quite prepared to pay $100 each for our food. However, once we got there via taxi and walked into the restaurant, it was not at all what I was expecting. Families everywhere with young children in high chairs, very casual dress standards (we were much better dressed than we should have been and so felt out of place somewhat). Whilst the setting was very nice, the food and service was very good and much cheaper than we were anticipating, we walked out of the White Rabbit feeling somewhat deflated and disappointed that it hadn't lived up to our expections. Perhaps we had been spoiled by the decadent high tea we had had at the Regent the afternoon before

My friend and I wanted something nice for our last meal in Singapore, and the White Rabbit didn't disappoint! We loved the style of the place itself, very simple, very subtle, creating a very calm ambiance. The service was impeccable, and the food was great! The foie gras was delicious, just like home.Would go back in a heartbeat

Attending a wedding at The White Rabbit for the morning ceremony and the dinner at night.Morning CeremonyThe setting is rather cozy but after the ceremony, when finger food are served, the quantity and speed need improvement. Imagine more than 100 guests but food are only served tray by tray by the wait-staff. The scene is not so pleasant. However, the drinks department was better. Free flow of drinks were served and if one cannot wait for the staff/drink to come, there is a drinks station to take the drinks directly.DinnerThere is a long table at the "stage" for the immediate family of the bride and groom and another long table in the middle of the restaurant (there 2 tables formed a T with a significant space)... very Hogwarts). By the side are circular tables that sit about 5 to 6 guests. This does not give guests a "packed" feeling but it also means that one can invite fewer friends and relatives. (Not sure if the restaurant has other sitting configurations).FoodA four course dinner that was delicious. I was told that the initial side dish is 'raw' scallop. Luckily the side dish we had was cooked meal! It was pasta with lobster. The main we had was either fish or beef (pre-ordered). Serving was not too big but with the bread served (very fragrant and hot from the oven), the stomach could be easily satisfied.There are parking lots but may not be enough if all guests drives

It was a unique dining experience. Love the simple, elegant, decor. The setting of the chapel felt like a meal excursion, taken back in time to an older gentile Singapore. The service was lovely. Kind, attentive staff. Felt very welcome. It was comfortable and the food delicious. And the drinks were a work of art. Highly recommend

Fantastic place with amazing food. I believe worth every cents to spend. If will get married, the wedding dinner will be there for sure!

It was an early Tuesday evening when we arrived for a simple dinner. Lovely place but very noisy - initially it was noise from the restaurant staff then it was noise from the patrons. The restaurant is way too dark - we saw a table of diners using their mobile phone torch to peruse the menu and another table requesting for a table lamp. Food portion is good and the bread was freshly baked and really good! However that evening, we found our lamb a little too rare, mushroom sides and spatchcock too salty. A couple of staff came by to ask how everything was and despite our feedback nothing was done . All that was said was we will give the feedback to the Chef! Utterly disappointed! Just felt that they were just going through the motion of asking how everything was without sincerity.
5
Such a great romantic restaurant for couples. Lovely ambience although it was a bit noisy due to the structure of the building which used to be a chapel. Food was great and reasonably priced considering the fine dining environment.
3
The food was ok, as was the service. They all walk about with ear pieces, but whenever we asked a question about the menu, they still needed to head off and consult someone else. We tried pouring our own wine form our own bottle and that resulted in a waitress dashing over and removing the bottle from our friend's hand and then said 'can I help you'? She then filled 3 of our glasses and emptied the bottle before getting to the person who was originally holding the actual bottle. Just silly.We had friends visiting from home (Switzerland) for my birthday and they really wanted to try this restaurant. I had read many reviews and decided to give it a go in spite of some negative comments. As it turned out, I should have heeded those comments and spent our $600 elsewhere. On arrival, we asked to have a drink in the outside bar, which is apparently lovely. It was closed for a private event. We were sent a number of texts confirming our booking and told not to be any later than 15 minutes. It's unfortunate we we not told that, as we then needed to walk around looking for somewhere else to have a drink before our booking time. Just not a nice touch to what should have been a special evening. The manager could not have cared less. I wouldn't recommend based on our experience and we won't be returnin

We had our wedding there last Wednesday. Selected them to host our wedding because of its wonderland whimsy. We really had no idea of where to start; so, we sent in an email literally asking "what should we do?" and "what would you suggest?". From there, everything went smooth! Really impressed by their thoughtful arrangement and impeccable service
5
A wonderful dining experience! My wife and i enjoyed a great 4 course set menu on a Tuesday night. All staff were attentive, efficient and polite. I was really impressed with the service - we never experienced that all too common feeling of wondering when drink/food will arrive. Meal was delicious - especially entree of scallops in white choc foam and the dessert of crepes suzette. The restaurant is beautiful - we loved the huge windows and stained glass. The seating was well placed allowing space for private table conversation. Im sure we'll return next time we visit Singapore
5
The White Rabbit was where we held our wedding dinner and so one year later, we are back to reminisce the day of our union.We had the 4 course prix fixe dinner menu and choose seared bay scallops, seared foie gras, brandt shortribs and crepe suzette; and as was blown away by the food and service. The service was impeccable and the food is exceptional.A special shoutout to Adrian, the assistant general manager, who went out of his way to make our wedding night and anniversary dinner beautiful and memorable
3
This restaurant came highly recommended so we decided to try it out with high expectations. I wouldnt say that the food was bad but it wasnt exceptional. We ordered a few different items from the menu. The rib eye steak was the best. I must say that the staff are very attentive and gave very good service. The ambience was romantic and it is interesring that the restaurant was once a chapel.
3
Read alot about this place, so we decided to go despite the prices!All I can say is we were very disappointed bearing in mind the cost. Most of the cheaper(?) $80 bottles of wine had run out (not surprisingly) leaving the choice of no wine or paying $150 for a $15 bottle of Aussie plonk.Maybe this is why all at the table felt arrived.I have a suggestion: give it a miss, the dÃ©cor and place is not special so nothing lost
3
With all the hype about White Rabbit, we decided to give it a try for dinner. The restaurant is located in the middle of Harding Road, in a white chapel. Interior is romantic and undoubtedly most of the guests were couples. There was also a private event outdoor at The Rabbit Hole.For starters, we had the burrata and the cauliflower as they were out of the lobster. Burrata was good but a little salty. Cauliflower was fried and served with curry mayonnaise sauce; it was not too bad. For sides, we tried the truffle fries, which was just okay. Would be better if they had added some parmesan. For the mains, we had the seabream and the ribeye. The portion for the seabream was small and it was quite tasteless. Ribeye was average, served with your choice of sauce. In summary, the menu is limited in this restaurant so do choose a backup in case the choice that you want is not available. Don't set your expectation too high as well on the food despite the romantic and unique interior. However, the service from the waiters were commendable
5
We surely spent a fortune that night but it was well worth it. Their specialty the gin is a real highlight. I had the prescription daisy - I don't think I had such a good cocktail ever since I left NYC. My bf went for the Brooklyn GT and they foamed up their house made tonic in some kind of apparatus that I can't even describe... Brilliant drinks.The signature carpaccio and king Crab tagliatelle for starters, sharing the Wagyu Cote de Boeuf and we were in food heaven. The have the Sassicaia by the glas, I don't think we ever saw that before. The gardens are very cute, great decor in the main restaurant. It all didn't come cheap but was totally worth it
4
The building is interesting but rather dark inside. The menu was not too big, which makes it easy to choose and the wine list was good. The food was tasty but nothing special. Very good service
2
We've enjoyed a meal at this restaurant before and decided to go back for our wedding anniversary. Unfortunately this was not as pleasant as our first visit.We arrived at 6pm so we could visit the gin bar attached to the restaurant. The gin bar was closed for a private function, the only notice informing us of this was an A4 piece of paper in the corner of the carpark. By the time we had read it, our taxi had gone and it is a long walk from here to other bars in the area.The restaurant opens at 6:30 so we asked if there was anywhere we could wait and have a quiet drink, we were told no, so we walked the 500m to the nearest bar, and back again for our reservation. I was in heels and a long dress so this took some time!On arriving back at the restaurant we could hear what could only be described as a terrible attempt at karaoke coming from the private function at the gin bar, not a great atmosphere.We sat down and were immediately told what food wasn't available from the menu, but no alternatives were provided. We ordered 2 glasses of champagne but this was also unavailable, we were told that the champagne which costs twice the price was available but not at any discount.At this point we were so disappointed we walked out and took our chances at a place up the road.For a restaurant that charges a premium, they do not place much importance on customer satisfaction, opting instead for maximum profit. There were alternative starters on the fixed price menu, but these were not offered as alternatives for the missing a la carte options. Also, it's common courtesy to offer a more expensive alternative at a discounted price if you are not able to fulfil the selection on our menu.I would recommend going to ChopSuey further up the road, much better food and service at a much better price

Great restaurant with inspired food, great gin list and a minimalist mid century modern interior. A treat in Singapore
5
This restaurant is perfect for a special occasion. The approach is magical and we sat in the garden drinking gin based cocktails. Hendricks with cucumber and rose petals is refreshing and delicate. Staff were attentive but unobtrusive and we were led through to our table in this amazing converted chapel. Chicken pate to start and sea bream for mains was beautifully presented with exquisite flavors and a little twist. Wine choice complimented a perfect evening. Thanks so much to all staff

Went on a Thursday night for dinner with hubby. Place was about 80% full. We took the 4-course Prix Fixe menu at $98++ which comprised a seared scallop with confit (or salad), foie gras (or carpaccio), shortribs (or sea bream) and cheesecake (or crepe). I went for the scallop confit, wagyu carpaccio, beef shortribs and crepes suzette. The seared scallop was a bit dry but the onion confit was good, savory and creamy, although I had to ask for a spoon as I was given a knife and fork for this dish. Waygu carpaccio was sliced very thin and the truffle cream and balsamic pearls complemented it very well when I bit into the bits of carpaccio mixed with the sauces. There were only 3 pieces of shortribs and as the fats were not well distributed, the meat became chewy and hard to bite through. So this dish wasn't that great. The black winter truffles do gave it a nice aroma though, I'm a sucker for truffles both white and black.Highlight of the meal was the crepe suzette with grand marnier, orange juice and lemon peel, flambéed at the table-side. It was served freshly cooked and the caramelised orange juice went well with the soft crepes. Maybe a tad too sweet but generally acceptable for a dessert. Overall, I found the food to be acceptable, not the best but I liked the appetizers and desserts.Place was quite dark and you can't really see quite well what you're really eating. Photography was also a problem. Too dark if not using flash and too bright if you do. Nice chapel and a pretty romantic location for a dinner for two if you are not too overly fussy with the food quality and not adamant about having nicely taken night shots.

Good service is hard to come by in Singapore, & I was more than impressed by the attentiveness & professionalism of the staff. Had an excellent birthday dinner with my girlfriend. Highly recommended, will return for special occasions

My recent dinner at the White Rabbit was a wonderful exprerience.The place is beautiful, pleasant, and rather romantic, in a beautiful chapel-like decor, with no loud music.Food was excellent, especially the oysters, the wagyu carpaccio, the sole meunière, the desserts (of course their signature crêpe Suzette). However, the Japanese seabream, a bit dry, was only so-so.The wine list is not too big, but obviously well-curated. I've been positively impressed by their Chablis.The staff is exquisitely polite, knowledgeable, skillful and efficient, particularly the chief-waiter Jack, whose skills would impress even the most well-trained French "maîtres d'hôtel". We were positively surprised to have free drinks as an apology for not having enough dishes available on the menu. We were amazed by the gentel and nice birthday message with the dessert, and a free picture offered. These commercial and nice gestures were not really necessary and this is why we were so happy : nice things are not necessarily made for commercial purposes. Among the waitresses, Tricia was also very skillful and friendly. Definitely one of the best restaurants I've ever been in Singapore, with a combination of excellent food and service

My Brother had recently visited the White Rabbit and had raved about the food and service so as we were visiting Singapore had made a point of booking a table.We ended up taking a client so there was three of us in total.The building used to be a church and is a really fascinating place with beautiful stained glass windows They have a very famous Gin and Tonic here with the tonic being made in house and delivered via a gas bottle - a wonderfully refreshing drink that should be sampled.We kicked off with a half dozen of each white pear oysters an seasonal oysters certainly not cheap at $127 for the dozen and coming from Australia where we are spoilt with great oysters I felt they were nice but not exceptional.We then ordered the duck liver pate - exceptional and the lobster bisque which was nice.For the mains two of us chose the lamb rack and the ribeye all of which were fresh and tender.All of the food was really great and the service headed up by Jack Goh was first class - this is a dinning experience and should be sampled at least once if you are living or visiting Singapore.Of course the wines are terribly expensive and we had no shame in selecting near the cheapest wines on the list except the $140 bottle of Mumm Champagne to start followed by the Château Favray Pouilly-Fumé 2014 which at $115 was a nice wine,the The Winery of Good Hope "Land of Hope" Pinot Noir Reserve 2011, Stellenbosch at $85 was a great pick.We finished off with some amaretto's on ice which rounded off an exceptional meal although I almost choked on the $800 + bill ! Nevertheless the food,service and setting were well worth every cent.Thank You to Jack Goh and his team and we will be back when we're next in Singapore

In a nutshell, the restaurant ticked all the boxes - good food, good service, good ambience. Are there better restaurants around at that price? I am sure there are. Au Petit Salut across the street would be the other option for top notch fine dining. But, I will return to the White Rabbit again. The foie gras was fabulous and the crepe dessert was delightful. And contrary to what others say, I actually thought the service was good. The staff were very attentive and very ready to take the initiative. A rarity these days in Singapore

We dined here with friends & chose the 4 course menu @ $98pp. 2 of us had matching wines for a bit extra $. the food was very good although the pace it came out was rather quick. you would expect at least 10-15mins between each course but it much faster. The service was a mixed bag, having to ask for a drink to start, do you have a wine list? etc are not what you expect these days. the most disappointing thing was close 10.45pm our waiter came & said 'we are closing in 5 minutes, so you have to go! We spent $995 between the 4 of us & considering there were 3 tables still there this was a bit offensive & something we had no encountered before.No offering of calling a taxi etc.. just we are closing. Perhaps this needs to be addressed for future diners
5
Was recommend to try The White Rabbit by friends again after a much earlier so-so experience a couple of years ago.As it was Mother's Day, it was extra special for our family especially since we had relatives in town for my brother's wedding dinner the evening before.We were impressed by the attention received & friendliness of the staff. The GM went around making sure everyone was having a great time.Enjoyed the lobsters, oysters & seafood salad. The prime rib was very decent too. What was extra nice was the main courses that was prepared a la minute whenever you requested for them.One of the best family meals we have had this year
5
Enjoyed a lovely evening at The Rabbit Hole (the bar area of The White Rabbit). Very nice outdoor ba area in a quiet green part of the city. Wonderful drinks and yummy nibbles. Will definite return

With all the hype and wonderful reviews, we decided to dine at The White Rabbit on a Friday evening. We had high expectations of this place, but unfortunately, this means that we get easily disappointed. When we were walking towards the entrance, 2 of the staff standing at the door watched us as we approached. Well, its fine if they do not wish to open the door for us, but we weren't impressed when the 2 staff hurriedly looked away as we opened the door, carried on flipping their papers, and completely ignored us, even after we were standing right in front of them. After an awkward minute of us looking for someone to attend to us while the 2 staff continued ignoring us, 1 of them decided to ask if we made any reservations. When we finally got seated, we were not given the menu, so we had another few awkward minutes wondering if it was a self-service restaurant. Fortunately, after the unimpressive entry, the service that followed was decent. Friendly and approachable staff.I was seated in a really bad location. I can't describe exactly where, but it was a table right below a step. There was a table behind me so close that if I had swung my head back, I may have destroyed all the food on their table. In any case, my seat was getting in the way of everyone who was heading to the bathroom. So you can imagine how "romantic" it is having children pushing your chair as you eat and adults grabbing onto your chair every now and then to balance themselves as they got up the step behind my chair. The food was average. We had the Japanese seabream and the 60-hour braised pork belly. The restaurant was really noisy on the evening we were there. So for the price paid, I would say there are better restaurants in Dempsey with lovelier ambience and service
5
Probably the only place in Singapore with consistently great service, hence I keep coming back. Love the crepes Suzette and deconstructed cheesecake! Keep up the great work
5
The setting is in an old church, the service is impeccable and the food is beautifully presented. They make an awesome Singapore Sling with fresh juices and lovely garnish -- enjoy it in the back garden if you can. They are famous for their shrimp bisque -- but unfortunately they had run out the night we dined there. Many in our group were very disappointed, having had it before. Reserve it when you make your reservation if you are set on having it. I had the pate foie gras for appetizer and it was amazing. My steak was OK, but thin and not up to the standard of the restaurant. Otherwise, this place is amazing and amazingly expensive. I'm so glad that someone else was paying. We clocked out at $200 per person. A night to remember
5
restaurant is in a church/chapel like building with modern deco, friendly yet un-obtrusive service. Ordered the set lunch, truffle beef carpaccio very subtle and tasty, the bread-rolls maybe not the freshest and crispiest in town, excellent lamb and crab tagliatelle for main, the sherbet in the "deconstructed" cheese cake was a delight.would we come again: YES :
5
What more to say, this is a fantastic restaurant, we were so well taken care of and the food was simply great. We had a set menu wine parings and got a wide range of great food with a good choice of wine to that. We had planned to take the 4 courses menu, but when we saw the choices, we decided of for the 5 courses menu, and we did not regret that at all. The venue is beautiful as it is an old chapel that makes the experience even better. So even if you think the prices are on the higher end, it is money well spent. I totally recommend this restaurant
5
I've been to a number of restaurants with children and often felt out of place with the surroundings and type of high end restaurant it is. I did not with 'The White Rabbit'.The whole meal was absolutely beautiful with the stunning 5 course menu with the complimented wine option. Our children reserved choice was the fries with chicken a pleaser for any child. The fact that they were being children did not impact on the staff and other customers attitude towards our table. If anything it's was enhanced with the welcome interaction by all the staff.If anyone is in Singapore this is a must go to place for dinner with the converted church surrounding and the intimacy that it provides will make your evening truly memorable. Well done, certainly exceeded this customers expectations.

The White Rabbit (and Rabbit Hole) at the edge of the Dempsey Hill area is one of my favorite restaurants in the world. I have visited many times over the past 4 years and have always completely enjoyed absolutely everything. The setting is idyllic, so close to the city but it's like you are in the country. Inside, the restaurant is stylish and lively while still intimate. The restaurant staff is very thoughtful, attentive, and warm. Relax with wine, beer or a cocktail before or after dinner in the "backyard" Rabbit Hole area. While everything on the menu is excellent, he Rangers Valley Wagyu Carpaccio is perhaps the best you will have anywhere in the world. The Lobster Bisque and Dover Sole Meuniere are also personal favorites. Don't miss the chance to finish your perfect evening with Crepes Suzette flambeed tableside. In all, an exceptional restaurant and one of my favorites in the whole world, I can't wait to go back
4
Lobster Bisque is saltish, we had mains Shortribs, Lamb Rack, Japanese Seabeam & others. The best is Brandt Shortribs, excellently done. Highly recommend this dish for meat lovers. Seabeam is good too. Nice Ambiance for the evening sipping white & red wines.
3
It was my first visit in TWR (and in the area). The location and ambience is great with tip top service from the crew - friendly, tentative, knowledgeable of their menu.Food wise, the food quality appears to be high and would be keen to return to try the other dishes as well. However, the prices are not for the faint hearted - I cannot justify paying for $55 for a Dover fish and $188 for a wagyu dish per person, not to mention the $20+ plate of bacon and egg with toast (which was what I ordered). In contrast, to be fair, any western-style dishes seems to be really expensive in SG, not to mention the ingredients are properly imported like everything else, based on observation so perhaps the pricing is normal(?)
5
Beautiful venue and excellent service. We ordered the four-course set dinner and were properly full despite the seemingly small portion sizes (we have fairly small appetites). The staff were extremely professional and attentive, without being intrusive. Prices are definitely on the higher end, but it was money well spent. Overall an excellent (first-time) experience. Highly recommended, and we will definitely be back
2
Visited White rabbit last Friday during the long Easter weekend with bunch of friends, It's our first visit for brunch as we had only been there for dinner which was not memorable. Would thought how bad brunch could be? ordered we Eggs Benedict , cold cuts , Wagyu Burgers , wine and some cocktails. and only the cold cuts and wine was decent. I havent had any bad eggs benedict till white rabbit had showed me how. burgers were average and cocktails were blahhh..Disappointing Brunch spread overall. which we didnt even proceed to dessert and coffee as we usually would.
4
Awesome service, great food and super ambience! Can't fault the occasion. We had a server that took the kids wishes into account and we didn't even tell them it was a birthday celebration. Reservation was quick and easy through Chope. We had the fine prix which sometimes can be disappointing due to the portion size. Perfectly executed on the scallops, foie gras, beef carpaccio, short ribs, crepe suzsette and cheese cake. I had the wine pairing with the food and it was spot on! Totally worth the spend and kudos to the team for a great experience!!!
5
Wow, what a beautiful place. Housed in a 1930s converted chapel which has been lovingly restored. Very professional waiting staff, and amazing menu. We were there for lunch and went for the 3 course menu. We had read some very positive reviews online and were not disappointed. The lunch menu came with some recommended wines at a very reasonable price. Will be back again for dinner.
5
My wife and I had a great Sunday Brunch at The White Rabbit this morning. We had originally tried to have dinner Saturday night however were not able to due to them having a private event. Even so the staff was very attentive and communicated promptly which lead us to try again. The reviews on TA were a bit mixed so we were not sure what to expect and we both were impressed. We were one of the first to arrive for the day and the service was pleasant and attentive from the first greeting. The menu was a nice balance of brunch staples and other lunch entrees which is a nice touch as often times brunches are only eggs and breakfast food. We started with mimosas and then split eggs benedict and shared a salad and everything was wonderful. From the fresh juice in the mimosa to the balance of flavours on the eggs benedict we truly enjoyed the meal. One recommendation to the staff would be that the grounds and the entrance from the parking lot could have used a clean up as there was trash and unsightly utilities. This takes away from the first impression of the restaurant.
5
We had lunch here and ordered set lunches. Delicious and fresh. Service was perfect even though we arrived a bit late and almost the time for last order at 2.15 pm. The set lunches were very nice.
4
Food was excellent however entree size. too small for the valueDon't know how they justify $100 plus for dozen oystersStaff very goodHowever be aware of " taxi " home rip off. Hop in after restaurant ordered into niceVan. To find out on arrival back to our hotel this was a private hire with a fee if $50A total rip off and put a damper on night results. Normal fee $

Fantastic meal in a beautiful setting, the walkway was lit with fairy lights. The food was amazing, the staff really helpful and attentive. Loved every minute

Very nice and original location, in an area full of restaurants. Food was good quality, and so was the service. A good place to relax and chat, both for couples and friends
5
The White Rabbit is an excellent venue to spend an afternoon with friends. The Garden area is whimsical and the outdoor bar is a great addition. The champagne and cheese plate was amazing and I highly recommend this venue. The venue inside is a renovated church and air conditioned (important for Singapore!). Go there for a date or with friends
3
The beautiful venue and the church next door make this quite an unusual place for weddings and parties alike. Food was so s
4
We have an enjoyable lunch for our celebration. Their set lunch menu come with good choices. Option for 2 or 3 courses. Since it was meant to be a birthday celebration, they have made the required arrangement for us.
4
Booked a table for 4. Set NYE menu. Excellent experience at a reasonable price. Staff service was attentive and no issues at all. Ended with a lovely DJ experience and some dancing. Good place
5
Took my wife here for a birthday brunch. Service was good - waiters were helpful and attentive. Food was good - fresh and attentively prepared. Ambience was good
5
My wife always wanted to try White Rabbit and Rabbit Hole do I booked it for her birthday. From the entry walking through the tunnel covered in vines and angel lights. The great service from the G&T bar at the Rabbit Hole (even the whiskey sours were great). To the amazing food to the unexpected Bomalaska gift for her birthday. We've found our new date night venue and can't wait to be back. The price is comparable to most others, yet the service and quality of food surpassed expectation
5
After a long trek in the humidity turning the corner and discovering The White Rabbit was a bit like coming across a mirage. The warm welcome from the staff as we arrived also helped to swiftly settle us in and a cooling drink, promptly delivered was much needed and welcomed.The menu was good and the kitchen staff accommodated a slight change to my fish dish. The food was well presented and fresh. Thank you for an enjoyable afternoon
5
today we had customer and partner meetings. for lunch we took them to this awesome place. its a old church out of 1800.but inside its a pretty new restsurant. staff really friendly, great food and drinkseverytime agai

most the 6 dishes we ordered were excellent, however my mushroom ravioli was slimy and tasted off (weird and bitter). i was too shy at the time to make it known to the wait staff because they were so attentive, but now realised i should have sent the dish back.
4
Lovely place. Great food with good servicE. Love the outdoor area out back, especially at night. Very good music outside.
5
Manager Roland and staff in general gave excellent service. When he realized that our order did not go through, he sincerely apologize and repeatedly came to check on our food.
We tried the bacon steak, truffled mac and cheese . both dishes were tasteful

Lovely white chapel located within Dempsey with free parking right outside the restaurant. The ambience was lovely! The fairy light arch further enhanced the overall romantic setting.My partner and I were there for our anniversary dinner. We had the Seasonal Oysters, Mushroom Ravioli, Alaskan King Crab Tagliatelle and SautÃ©ed Japanese Seabream and ended the night with the Lemon Meringue Tart and Crepe Suzette. The food was a little too salty for our likings. Nonetheless, the service was impeccable. I left a comment during my online reservation that it's an anniversary dinner and requested for a sofa seat in a quieter corner. My request were fulfilled but little did I expect to have the "Happy Anniversary" written on our dessert plate. Such pleasant surprise
5
Great place for brunch. Love the setting and interior. They serve awesome bread and butter pudding. I tried their Dover Sole, which was cooked to perfection. Lightly salted and flavorful.
4
We went for drinks at the Rabbit Hole and it was a great experience, there is a lot that can be done with the venue. However its a great place to meet and have a few drinks in an ideal settings, the signature drink is definitely the Gin with the homemade tonic absolutely delicious. Service needs some work and can be slow but just enjoy the outdoors and where you are. Enjoy
5
We went here for a meal with friends on a Wednesday evening, what a place. The ambience was delightful being in an old chapel. The food was some of the best I have tasted in Singapore, especially the pate! and the service was good but not too intrusive. Well done White Rabbit
1
Horrible service. It was raining and they could not bother to supply us with an umbrella to get us to the nearby carpark when we politely requested, but brushed us off with irritable tone. The female waitresses were better trained but the male waiters' service left much to be desired
5
The Brunch sharing platter is amazing, good for around 2-3 pax. It is also adequately priced which matches the portion served.I had the Eggs Benedict with salmon. Salmon was amazing and the hollandaise were just right.Service were prompt and professional.Overall a pleasant experience as the portion served were adequately matched with the pricing, not to mention the colossal beauty of the stained glass structure.On a side note, tends to get a little echoey loud when the place starts to fill up
5
Really fantastic service, service staff was very attentive and food was served on time, friendly service staff and chef as well. really enjoy the time there and will go again. perfect place for gatherings with friends and family.

food are pretty average and overpriced for this standard. maybe the food we ordered are bad. atmosphere and service are good
4
Went for a wedding dinner there. Ambience was good, there's aircon. Food not bad. Nice hall to walk down the aisle. Spacious enough to move about. However, toilet only 1. There is another toilet in the bridal room actually. Parking space limited. Staff was ok. They remembered the orders

Service was execellent as the staff were all very attentive.Food wise was great. Very deliciously made and you can feel that they really put in the heart and soul into the food making.$$ wise was on the high side. If you are looking for good value food, affordable cost with high quanlity, this place will not be for you. But definitely if you are bringing your date here, she will be pretty much impress

Recently, my friend and I went for the set lunch at The White Rabbit and we truly enjoyed it. The restaurant has a nice ambience -quiet and peaceful too.We were pretty impressed with the attentive services rendered by the staff. The decoration of the food is both creative and palatable. I understand the restaurant take several hours to cook certain meat to produce a tender and flavourable meal for the customers. The dessert is both nicely presented and delicious too
3
The ambience was wonderful and food was good although the lamb was a little fat. However, the service was inconsistent - the young lady serving us and young man who did our crepe suzette served us well but the guy preparing the table for our dessert was uncouth and boorish. This spoilt our experience somewha

They had an (19/11/15) event for an up coming chef from London, chef ollie dabbous read about it and wanted to try his cooking. It was a great meal food nicely cook and present with good taste lovely. Money worth spending to get the experience. The restaurant gave me a nice sitting, even alone I felt so comfortable and service was good too. Love the even
5
Love the ambience, service and food. Will recommend to families and friends. We went during evening. It's kind of dark though. It would be great if they can increase the lighting a bit.  
4
It's big and spacious and you almost feel naughty for dining in a "church". The staff are attentive and the set lunch menu good value. I've been here many times and never disappointe
5
I love this place. Their food menu is exceptional, their alcohol brew, even better. Love the interior renovation but I would suggest sitting outside at night, as the ambience is one to really soak up. Got served by a Vicky who was very courteous and prompt with delivering our drink orders. Definitely going back again.
4
We went there for Birthday dinner, the food and ambience is great. This is a place fit for any occasion.
5
the food and ambience is amazing. we even received a surprise birthday greeting on the dessert too!!!!
5
A place worth splurging on food and ambience, especially if it's for a celebration. Need a car to get there though.
5
We came here for our 5th Anniversary and had the Prix Fixe 4 course menu.Every dish was delicious and came out quickly. We managed to finish all 4 courses within 1 hour and left with satisfied (and not too full stomachs).They presented desserts with "Happy Anniversary" written in choc on both plates and even took a photo of us and printed it out with a beautiful message written on the back.I'd definitely go back
5
It took me a while to find the place but once i stepped into the entrance it felt like i was not in singapore. My gf and i ordered the alaskan king crab tagliatelle (ang moh mee pok), pot roasted spatchcock, sauteed field mushroom and chocolate fondant for dessert. Every dish was excellent. The service was also excellent
3
This trip was disappointing as our food was overcooked and portions were really small. Only the desserts were still as good. There was a UOB 1 for 1 offer but this should not have affected the cooking standard or portions. Service staff were still very good and nice
2
The ambience was nice but the food was below par. One of the service staff seemed very impatient while helping us to take picture
3
Overall experience was good. It would have been even better if the one Littre of water was not charged at s$10 !!! We thought it was "water" , which is free in Singapore!!!The waiter did not clarify with us at all
1
I booked the restaurant by calling them,which the receptor told me still have the UOB 1 for 1 promotion, and then when come to bill they told me 1-1 promo is only available for 1 person on 1 table....so I force to paid 5 persons price as I come with my whole family. Couples are suitable for this restaurant

Celebrated my birthday at The White Rabbit restaurant. It wasn't crowded that night hence the staff are able to cater to the services of consumers there. However, the staff that served us was overly 'eagered to service' as he kept rushing us through our order to a point my friend has to ask him to come back while we decide on what to ordered (which we actually already did know what we wanted but it was kind of .. annoying). Beside that fiasco, Ordered Alaska King Crab Pasta and it taste heavenly, so are the rest of our order i.e.: Mushroom Ravioli, Truffle fries (supreme AWESOMENESS) and their desert, Bordier Cheese Selection, comes with a 'show' whereby the staff will cook them in front of you. Needless to say. the crepe taste wonderlicious !!Will definitely go back again !!
5
Service and food were excellent. Definitely would patronise again! A must go for couples who want to have a romantic dinner.
5
The staff are very professional and service oriented .
They make us feel comfortable and really enjoy the lunch throughout .
In fact, I have made appointments to visit the restaurant again.
4
Very nice ambience and impeccable service. They gave a small birthday dessert for my boyfriend beyond my small request and even printed a photo for us. Best birthday dinner ever.
4
The food is so pretty it's like works of art. Food is easy on the eyes and pleasing on the palette! Definitely coming back. And service was excellent :
4
Beautiful building, converted church, well done decor and space for diners.The lighting, per my preference, is PERFECT - muted and dim even for such a large building, yet clear enough to see what you are eating and everything else... WELL DONE.Food was good, however seabream was slightly overcooked - that's an unfortunate mistake and hopefully a one-off.The GIN menu was FANTASTIC...and the drinks are very large ...unfortunately that means the dose of gin is not heavy enough for most gin drinkers. They could perhaps offer different dosages or offer less tonic as an option. Homemade tonic was good - not too sweet and the table side pour works well.Will be back
5
The White Rabbit specialises in slightly tweaked and updated "heritage food", which means that the menu looks old fashioned at first glance. You might remember some dishes (like Bombe Alaska) from another era entirely. It's not the exciting fusions of ingredients of young guns on Keong Saik Rd, it's oysters, foie gras, sea-bream, steak, pork belly and lamb racks. But... it's done with such subtlety, and attention to detail and quality, that the results are exciting in their own way.The White Rabbit really is a class act from start to finish, which is what you would expect for the not insignificant price you'll be paying. A table of 4 with a pre-dinner drink and a bottle of wine can expect to rack up $150 per head quite quickly.Arrive a little early and enjoy a drink at The Rabbit Hole before you start. It's a highlight of the evening sitting in the beautiful gardens surrounded by twinkly lights.With all the small plate dining and hip-semi-casual concepts in Singapore at the moment, this restaurant harks back to a different era, and that's actually a good thing. There is a sense of dining as "something special" here, and it'd be an ideal choice for romance
4
Went there on an UOB 1-for-1 promotion on lunch set. She order a wagyu beef with a touch of truffle oil. Not bad. But the highlight is the pan seared foie gras. It has a nice crisp of char on the surface while maintaining a creamy texture inside. Heavenly! The king crab with fettuccini is a disappointment as the crab was shredded into tiny strands with small portion. The fish entree was small too. But hey, it is one for one for a 3-course meal. Pretty good after all.
5
My highest review grade is when I think a place is where angels copulate on you tongue. In other worlds a 3 star Michelin tanking. The White Rabbit is such a place. We started with lobster bisque and chicken liver pate. Food which dances on your taste buds best describe these. Then I had the lamb rack. singapore's best lamb. My friends had the fish and steak. The criticism was that the steak was not rare as ordered. This is a great restaurant the ambience is an old church so you just have the best of all worlds. Highly recommende
3
Mushroom Rivoli in particular does not suit our taste buds. The cheesecake to be frank is awesome and recommended 
4
I was thankful we had not sat down to dinner straight away and elected to go for a drink in the garden, as there was a 15minute power cut. Being in the garden made for a beautiful, peaceful pre dinner drink. The food was good although they did get out order wrong but it was swiftly rectified. Altogether a nice place
4
Was welcomed by greetings at the door, attentive n friendly staffs. Loved the rabbit hole garden! Felt lie Alice!
4
Food is tasty! Be prepared for small portion on the set lunch, all right for ladies though. Free & unlimited serving on bread & butter is a plus point. Ambience is great. Service is acceptable. Keep it up!
5
The menu was excellent, loved the Gin drinks menu and home made tonic. We ate the ribs and rib eye, both were cooked to perfection.
4
My family and I had a most pleasant birthday brunch at White Rabbit. Service was excellent as always!
4
I was there with a fnew I end for a dinner for the first time. The size of the restaurant is very amazing with a great service. The food was very good also.
3
I've been there the 2nd time. Having the same feeling. Excellent ambience, nice presentation but when food was put into the mouth, it's not there yet. Good if you want a nice place to chill out.
5
Great Ambience with Excellent Service Staff. Love the food presentation and will definately visit whitr rabbit again.
5
I made a reservation through Chope for a lunch at The White Rabbit to celebrate my husband's birthday. The food served were of quality and the service was beyond my expectation. They noted the remarks i made on my reservation to include a candle in one of the dessert served, and my husband had a pleasant surprise. One of the service staff came with a digital camera and helped us took a photo which they then printed a hardcopy for us with a sweet birthday message.The service staff were attentive, they top up the drinks and changed the plate promptly for every course.My husband & I enjoyed the food and we have a really pleasant experience.
4
Visited this place for lunch on a weekday, and we ordered the set lunch. Includes a starter, main, dessert. Portions were slightly small for starters and main. Food is pretty well done, but I expected more in terms of flavor. Nice setting in a church. Nice ambience. High ceiling and spacious dining environment.The staffs were very attentive and will check on you time to time without being too imposing. Each time we were done with the course, they will clear the plates, set the utensils for the next course, and bring out the next course promptly. Even though it was 3 course lunch (we added a coffee at the end), it was possible to complete in 1.5 hours. That works if you have restricted lunch hours.
3
Booked here for lunch to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Had requested for a quiet table along the side but they put us at the centre row section as think they were booked out. It was surprisingly very noisy and we could hardly hear each other and the waiter. Had to ask the waiter to repeat himself as he was informing us of changes in the set lunch options. Strange, that previous reviews did not mention this. Perhaps it was the hard interiors which just reflected all the sound around but think perhaps it was the 2 large groups having lunch there as well. They were quite boisterous. We could hardly talk to each other without raising our voices so gave up after a while. So much for the romantic lunch I was looking forward to with my better half!The water : When we sat down, the waiter asked "still or sparkling?". At first we did not understand and then he mentioned "water?". We said still. Later the waiter came and poured the "still" water for us. Only realised at the end when the bill came that the "still" water was actually Evian and it cost us $10++! Think the waiter should have made it clear at the beginning that the"still or sparkling" was chargeable. Maybe he thought we should have known but it left us with a bitter taste. Lesson learnt!The set lunch was overall OK. The scallops was OK and the salmon (which replaced the sea bream) was slightly above average. The 60 hour pork belly was also alright. But the pièce de résistance were the deserts! Best part of the meal. The choc fondant and lemon meringue were both good. Was also impressed that the chef inscribed "Happy Anniversary" on the desert plates for us! That was a very nice touch!Despite the "water' incident, service overall was pretty good. But the high level of noise (reminded me of being in a school tuckshop during recess!) affected the ambience and significantly detracted from the overall experience as we were unable to have a decent conversation. Just ate and left quickly
5
We celebrate my Wife's Birthday last August 30, 2015. The food and service were great!!! Thank you for the The White Rabbit experience!!
4
Great experience at such a wonderful restaurant
Like the atmosphere and serving quality so much, thx
4
A restaurant in an old chapel. Decor was really nice and service from the staff is excellent. 36 hours short ribs were so delicious. And the deconstructed cheesecake was so unique n delicious.
5
I took my in laws and baby for lunch here. We chose off the set lunch menu and had 3 courses which was S$42++. The food was fantastic, especially the desserts!They had a nice highchair and didn't mind is sitting with an infant at all. The wait staff were attentive, but not intrusive.We asked for water and should've specified a hug or glass as we were given a bottle of evian which cost S$10! But the complimentary bread made up for that!This restaurant is fine dining, in a lovely setting with the stained glass windows still in place.I would recommend having lunch here and will be returning with my husband
3
This was my third visit to the restaurant. The food is good and well presented. And the UOB credit card promotion makes the set lunch extremely good value. Ambience is nice but the hard floor and high ceiling cause a lot of echoeing so it gets really noisy when crowded. Most notable on all 3 visits was the slow service - wait was like half an hour between courses. Nice place to go to but be prepared to wait.
3
I typed a whole bunch on Chope but the page lost what I typed. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzJack (manager) and Chinese kid stationed outside on 30th Aug 2015 had good service. The rest, not so. Food was a tad salty. Foie gras excellent. Small portions
4
We were a table of 6 adults and 3 kids having brunch. This is one of the few establishments in Singapore where they actually greet you at the door warmly. Even though most of the party were late for an hour, they never once came to 'harrass' us to order anything. It was my first time so I was really in love with the interior of the place. The stained glass window and high ceiling were gorgeous! The food was okay. Will be back to fine in this pretty restaurant.
5
Went to the White Rabbit to celebrate my anniversary with my girlfriend. She was awe-stricken by the beautifully restored chapel with high white ceilings.The formal service here is really top-notch. My experience summarized in 5 points1. No pressure in menu selection or in what to order. 2. After ordering, went out to the secret garden behind to take photos, Manager had our food covered in silver platter covers to prevent cooling. Waiter went all the way to garden to call us.3. Did not forget my online request to write " Happy Anniversary" on dessert plate4. Free DSLR photo taken, printed and signed for us with best wishing by the staff.5. Book a taxi for us out of Dempsey Hill with no hesitationOverall, the food was great and classy. Being treated like royalty for the entire evening, the 7% service charge here is a steal. Highly recommend to any guys looking to impress your girl once in a while!
4
We ordered the 5-course Prix Fixe menu and it was great. The seared scallop for starter was nice and rich, the main course of either seabream or shortribs are fresh and very well prepared. The dessert was absolutely delightful. The deconstructed cheesecake was unique and light. My personal favourite though was the Crepes Suzette. The waiter will prepared this dessert on the spot, the sweetness was spot on, with the added tanginess of the orange and the cold smoothness of the ice-cream, a really enjoyable dessert. The overall service is also wonderful. Highly recommend for a romantic yet frill-free night out. The only drawback is it is slightly pricey. A five-course meal for 2, without any wine set us back to $300+. Fortunately this was offset with the wonderful dining experience
5
My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves during our lunch date at The White Rabbit from the moment we stepped in till we left. Service came with a smile and the very professional and warm service staff made the effort to engage in short conversations with us despite the fact that the place was busy during the peak lunch hour. The food was fabulous.A delight to the senses. For starters, the Pan-seared Foie Gras was fantastic so we ordered for two. These were followed by two main courses - the Rump Back in place of the Brandt Shortribs and the Braised Mangalica Pork Belly, simply melted in the mouth and were juicy and tender.Finally, the desserts - the Chocolate Fondant and the Lemon Meringue Tart with vanilla ice cream with an additional side order of a Long Black, was the peak of this wonderful epicurean experience.It was like dining in Alice In Wonderland, beautiful, surreal and unforgettable, the fairy tale straight out of an old story book. Taking a post-lunch stroll in the courtyard and garden, we took some photographs at the Rabbit Hole. That completed the whole experience for us that afternoon.We will certainly visit again, especially on special occasions.
3
Beautiful location but unfortunately this will be the only thing we will remember...
Food was good. Not more.
Service good but slow and way over-formal.
All that does not justify the price, which is on the high end.
5
Service at The White Rabbit is impeccable. Every wait staff is swift, professional and politely attentive to diners. Food selection is excellent. Overall ambience is perfect for dining, with the natural lighting and high ceiling giving a tranquil mood ready to dine.
4
The still water cost 10 bucks.(excluding service charge and gst). Was not aware of this. Go for normal ice water(free) instead.
Deconstructed cheesecake is worth a try. Their crew went extra miles to bother explaining how to go about eating it.
4
We took advantage of the UOB 1 for 1 Set Lunch deal. Excellent value for money. 1. Ambience - Beautifully restored old chapel. 2. Service - Very attentive. Bread rolls constantly being refilled. 3. Food - Starters - Wagyu Carpaccio, Foie Gras - perfect. Main - King Crab Tagliatelle - looked like Mee Pok, but tasted wonderful. Pork Belly - Bit too fatty. Dessert - Lemon Meringue - nice presentation, Chocolate Fondant - okFeedback - The UOB 1 for 1 deal was not listed on their website, FB page or on Chope's website so I tried calling the restaurant to re-confirm about this deal, but no one picked up the line. I also left a question on their FB page, but it took them about 5 days to reply, by which time I had already had lunch at the restaurant.
5
I had a wonderful dining experience here. I mentioned I was gluten free as I could not take the bread that they gave and they took the liberty of changing my menu to cater to my diet restrictions. I am glad for that as it was one of the few restaurants where I didn't have problems with after dining. I had a wonderful celebration with my husband as well. We both loved the food, ambience and of course the wonderful service
3
A business dinner for three of us included 2 salads and one soup. Salad lovely - verdict on the soup 'watery and very average'. A steak (given 5/10 by the diner), crab pasta (9/10) was tasted delicious, but was overlooked and an oversalty sea bream. A real mixed bag of scores.As others have said it's extremely dimly lit - not in a romantic way - almost is if they can't afford the bill
3
Beautiful courtyard area, nice interior design - unfortunately you can only dine inside, which is a bit dark ish. Had a salad and truffle fries for a light meal. Salad Printemps was pretty to look at but tasted just ok - I didn't really feel like finishing it. Truffle fries were good but a bit on the greasy side, not really crispy....Would say you go there for a nice date to get some drinks, not really a hearty satisfying meal for the price
4
Went there some months back for dinner after reading reviews on the positive aspects of The White Rabbit - nice deco, quiet place and acceptable food. The ambience was good, best to drive in (quite secluded), but food was average. Dishes were slightly salty (tried the dover sole meuniere and pot-roasted spatchcock) - and slightly pricey for the quality of food (SGD 40-50 before GST / service tax).The happen to serve Papa Palheta coffee for those who are interested for some caffeine boost.Good to bring people for a special occasion, but expect to fork out a fair bit for slightly above average food
5
I ordered 5 course set dinner and a la carte Beef steak. The beef steak was one of the best steak among all I have tried. Their mock-tails tasted great,too. The only disadvantage is that the place was not near any public transportation, so I will suggest to drive there.
3
This restaurant is disappointing!I have booked this restaurant for our wedding anniversary and expected an evening of wine and great food. However, we found the food to be of average quality and the service is only above average. I had ordered the ribeye steak but instead I got a thin steak that looked more like a minute steak and it was too salty (the red wine sauce). It was also badly presented. We were there for 90 minutes and for the entire time, our water glasses were not refilled.Instead my husband's cocktail got a refill without him asking for it and of course, they charged for it.Several times, I had to refill our own wines, before the attendant realise that and came rushing to help us top our wine up
4
Enjoyable weekend lunch with my family. The foods and services were reasonable good. Specially love the building and surrounding. Would recommend this place for gathering.
5
We ordered Dover sole and avocado mango salad. Food is very tasty and service is great. Nice building structure
5
I think my review title says it all. The restaurant is in a transformed old chapel. I made reservation for brunch there on a weekend. Besides good food, their services are very attentive too.
5
Had a birthday brunch here and i definitely recommend it. Staff was friendly and food was very good in an excellent setting. No complaints.
2
the food that we ate are not nice given that the crab pasta that was recommended by the staff is the bestseller. But the tomato basil bread is delicious.the place is so dimly lit that i can barely see the menu. Plus their location is far so you need to walk far from the bus stop or you need to take a cab.The staff are friendly and accommodating
5
My fiancÃ©e and I had our wedding food tasting at white rabbit. We were hosted by Izan and Kelvin. We cannot be happier that we decided to get married at The White Rabbit. We have always enjoyed our dinners there and the team led by Kelvin and Adrian are absolutely first class. Highly recommend this place as a definite stop when you visit singapore. One of the most romantic restaurants in Singapore coupled with top notch service and delicious food. Must tries, wagyu carpaccio, lobster bisque and the sea bream
5
A friend recommended this place to us when we were in Singapore. SO glad we went here! It was BEAUTIFUL!! An old converted church turned into a fancy restaurant! WOW! The environment was out of this world! The food was delicious and the staff extremely attentive. Could not recommend this place enough and if ever I find myself back in Singapore, I will definitely be going back here
5
We went there on a Tuesday evening for my wife's birthday. The Foie Gras was amazing, and the shortribs were very tasty. The waiters were very professional and friendly - I mentioned at the beginning that it was my wife's birthday, and so they brought her a candle on her dessert. Very nice touch. The inside is really great and quiet on a weeknight. Definitely a good place for a nice romantic evening meal
3
Had a group lunch over the weekend on Saturday at about 1pm. Did not know that the set lunch was not available then with only choice from the brunch menu so most of us opted for the quarter pound burger S$28. Not impressed for the price, better burger at Bread Street kitchen at MBS or even the Black Swan. Ambiance was nice but not the most convenient location
5
Visited White Rabbit after hearing good reviews about the restaurant. Made a reservation as I was celebrating a birthday for a special someone.The food was fantastic - the 36 hour short ribs were to die for. Service was good but a tad slow. Nonetheless, the restaurant went the extra mile to draw happy birthday on the dessert plate and took a photo for us. Atmosphere - highly recommended for dates. The fairy lights in the garden, the swing, the beautiful chapel... very memorable
4
Amazing food and location takes your breath away! Service was great! Maybe a tad too high in pricing.
3
The set is beautiful but the service and food were mediocre for the price. Pork belly was under cooked.
5
The White Rabbit was more magical than we expected at night. The fairy lights behind the chapel and the chapel windows with its dim amber lights were classy and romantic. The gourmet food was delightful to the eye and tastebuds. Service was excellent. The crew even took and printed a picture for us to help us celebrate our anniversary! :
5
It was superb! The food, the service, the environment. All worked well together. Every single food item was awesome. By ranking - 1) Rangers Valley Wagyu Carpaccio ->2) 36-hour Brandt Shortribs (so tender, its unbelievable) -> 3) 60-hour Braised Mangalica Pork Belly -> 4) Alaskan King Crab Tagliatelle. My friend was super happy too. 
5
Of course, being held in an old church, the restaurant is beautiful from the inside. The food was really delicious and they did something special for my birthday, as well. I really enjoyed it here but it is a bit pricey. Located in Dempsey, which is also a beautiful location
4
A very decent 3-course lunch in a cozy ambience old church with friendly casual fine dining services. Appetizer- Seared Scallops were juicy but a little saltyMain Course- Brandt Shortribs is crispy at the outside and very tender inside. wish for the second plate! Dessert- Chocolate Fondant that surprised me with salted caramel filling pairs well with the banana & rum ice creamI will definitely go back again to enjoy their ambience at night! =
4
Back at White Rabbit with 2 birthday gals for lunch. Food plating was excellent, quality generally still good (pork belly was undercooked though), and service still excellent. Loved the hot rolls and how the desserts of the birthday gals were plated with greetings. The gals were really pleased to have photos taken for them as well. All in a great lunch for them
5
Back to white rabbit for a business lunch, the food was delicious and the service is amazing! Both of us order 3 course set lunch at $42++. My starter is seared scallop which was cook to perfection. My main course is their famous short-ribs, I was told it was braised for more than 36 hours. Crispy on the first bite and the rest will slowly melt in your mouth. I had chocolate fondant as my dessert. But my mind still craving for the short rib. At times both of us forgotten that we out on a business lunch. Our server Jan is impeccable, genuine service not pretentious. Strongly recommend this restaurant. Will be back for more

Despite my thinking the food and service is fairly average at the White Rabbit, I’d still recommend it based solely on the ambience – it’s a cool building.I’ve been to the White Rabbit a few times; once in a small group of 3, another time in a larger group of 12. Both times I wasn’t blown away.First, with the exception of the burrata salad (which is excellent but at the end of the day it's cheese and tomatoes... hard to screw up), the food I’ve had was average and the menu is not overly innovative or special. The service is pretty nonchalant and inattentive, something that is common in a lot of Singapore restaurants. Here's a funny story. The first time we went to the White Rabbit, one of our party of 3 ordered a glass of red. After 20 minutes and after our starters arrived and having served the other two in the party with their glasses of white, the waiter came over to poor the red. I liked the touch of pouring at the table, but I quickly stopped them when I noticed they were pouring the wrong wine. They replied with a feigned smile that they had run out of the wine we had ordered – no mention of this before pouring. I then asked how much this particular glass of wine was: $6 more. Now this is no joke, we then ordered a different glass of red and 10 minutes later, the same waiter came back and proceeded to pour the wrong wine again…the same wine they tried to pour previously! By this time, our mains had arrived and we still hadn’t sorted out the wine problem. Sadly, this little spectacle went on until we had almost finished our mains… I’m not kidding. That’s how long it took to point out the wine we wanted on the menu to getting the wine we wanted into a glass. I’ll also highlight that at no time was there an apology or recognition that they had made a mistake. Oh well, the company was good, the food was okay, and the ambience was nice. I will say, to the above, that when presented the bill, they had taken off one of our sides but still no apology. It is a little annoying to spend that kind of money on dinner and one of the guests unable to get a glass of wine to enjoy it with. Sounds trivial, I know, but regardless, these are mickey mouse issues that are almost laughable.Who would I recommend this restaurant to? It’s a nice place to go on a date. It’s romantic, particularly if you get one of the alcove bench tables. The other time I went was with a group of guys and we did have a wonderful time although I reckon that was down to the amount of wine drunk – I can’t remember much about the food. The outdoor bar area is also quite nice in the evening for a drink.All in all, the White Rabbit is a nice place but with an unimaginative menu and average food. This place has the potential to be a lot better

Booked an evening at the White rabbit one day before for my wedding anniversary. It was difficult to find a place which had ambience, good food & allowed kids as I had 3 little boys. Surprisingly they allowed so I booked it. From arrival till the end. The place really entices you with a mixture of feelings. The ambience and space was good to have a walk around with the boys, take pics and a huge field for them to run about. Were greeted by ever so friendly staff who went above and beyond to ensure that all guests were taken care of. Not forgetting the food. The lobster bisque, crepe Suzette is a must try. Try their top grade oysters, you won't regret. Mac & cheese was a hit for the boys. Entire evening was perfect and well taken care of by Adrian & his team who was all smiles. Very seldom you get good service like that in Spore nowadays. Will definitely return for another great experience. Pricing was also very reasonable. Very good place for couples & celebrations! Or for anyone who wants to hang out at the outdoor bar in the garden.
5
Unique atmosphere, great service, great food! We spent a great evening in this former church - well served and delicious.
4
Good atmosphere but menu selection can be better. Also, price is rather expensive relative to the serving.
3
Booking for 2. Food was pleasant enough - just a huge rush as main course arrived as the starter plates were cleared away! Main course had leeks - with sand so not so good there! We watched several tables have 'bombe Alaska' - with the waitperson struggling to light the 'flambe' - either the liqueur was not warm enough or his 'Bic' lighter was low on gas!! Finally had to mention that to the wait person to sort out the issue - as this dish is meant to be 'theatre' not 'rehearsal'!! Our crepes Suzette was cooked and served without incident - after our earlier comment re issues with flambe:-) Wait staff need some coaching on which side to serve food from - and which side to clear - as we had a lot of reaching across the table in front of us
5
Since The White Rabbit used to be a church, the venue is very well lit and has good lighting during brunch /lunch. The former church's mosaics together with the sun light gives a nice effect to the overall ambience. As for food, truffle Mac and cheese tops my list. I also like their warm spinach salad and Wagyu burger. I always make it a point to drop by the White Rabbit when I'm in Singapore. It has become one of my go to restaurants whenever I'm in town.
3
Several years ago I enjoyed a wonderful cocktail in its gardens and was keen to get back to try it for dinner, particularly because the menu looks great. The setting remains striking--an old church, stained class windows, appropriate lighting--and as a gin drinker I was impressed by their gin selection and cocktails. But my overriding memory of White Rabbit is of remarkably uninspiring cooking. Meat that didn't have much flavour, pasta was bland--and portions and price weren't good either. If you're looking for a fun spot with friends for drinks it's great. If you're interested in good food I would pass

It was my girlfriend's birthday and I wanted her to have a memorable one. I am glad I chose The White Rabbit as the place to dine. During reservation I noted that it was my girlfriend's birthday and we were pleasantly surprised when our dessert came, it had the words "Happy Birthday" on the plate! But the best surprise of the day was when we received an instant photograph with compliments from The White Rabbit. The food and the ambience may be great, but it's the service of the staff that made our lunch truly enjoyable. Thank you, The White Rabbit!+ The food was excellent. + The ambience was very classy. + The staff were very professional.+ The service was impeccable. Thank you for making our day! =

We went just recently for a family celebration and the whole occasion was fantastic. The ambiance is superb as you are dining in an old church with beautiful stained glass windows. Service is excellent but the food was amazing! It isn't cheap - but it is value for money as this was a great experience. We can recommend the lobster bisque, fois gras and some beautiful scallops - but the real star were the crepes suzette! I should love to go back

Restaurant on the grounds of an old (non-denominational) church. We were there for a wine dinner so prices were arguably more affordable (similar to the prix fixe they have on their site). The pairing was decent and wine served at appropriate temperatures. On to the food.........what I remember since it was a wine dinner;-Lobster salad: very nice clean plate, good flavour and good portion too. Must have been a 1/2 lb lobster tail, SautÃ©ed Foie Gras - also a good size and good flavours.Alaskan king crab, pork broth, kombu and tagliatelle - hands down my favourite of the entire meal. I almost licked the plate clean and my friend did the same.Wagyu sirloin - tender and pink. Too pink for my friend but then she doesn't like meat all that much luckily. I had hers too.Deconstructed Cheesecake - my friend's favouriteAll in all, one of the better meals I've had in Singapore, however, a friend tells me she went to something similar there and things were only so-so. I suppose I will need to go again to and see if my excellent experience repeats itself
5
Lovely location, excellent service and fabulous food. Their capacious is possibly the best I've ever had the 24hr poached pear is just to die for. The wine list is extensive and expensive buy no more so than elsewhere in Singapore. Arrive early and relax in the gardens with a cocktail first
4
Lovely ambience dining in a stained glass church. I've been here several times, once for lunch, once for a wedding dinner and this time for dinner. Food has been great all 3 times I've been here. Complimentary warm bread is served before the meal and you can choose from baguette, breadstick etc. Beautiful plating for each & every dish, makes dining a real joy. One of their signature dishes is the Mac & cheese which I would highly recommend to order to share.
4
The restaurant food is average, but the ambience (old church) is impressive. Threw an engagement party here in 2009 in the garden outside and it was perfectly suitable for the occasion. I also like their events/ summer parties.
5
Wonderful place with friendly staffs. A novelty to eat in a place which used to be a church. Definitely worth trying for those who didn't.
5
Took my wife for the lunch buffet and it was excellent. Very good food and service, good atmosphere> Will definitely come back
5
Quiet location, comfortable seating, attentive staff. Ordered the Wagyu quarter pounder which is very juicy, great hand cut fries, a bit of salad on the side, it's actually enough for two (they will cut it in half if you asked). Also tried their signature salad which was also very good. In all it's a perfect Sunday brunch. They have other brunch options, menu on their website. Price-wise it's reasonable, you spend about the same at Jone's but get significantly better serving and quality. This is a good place to bring someone special to have a long chat with great food.
3
A very beautiful restaurant housed in an old and elegant chapel. It has a very nice ambience and is perfect for a romantic meal.The main course is not impressive though. My wife and I had wagyu quarter pounder and scrambled egg with mushroom. The wagyu beef burger was a tad too salty and the scrambled egg with mushroom was too plain.The desserts "saved" the entire meal. We got the CrÃªpes Suzette. The crepes were very delicious and the presentation was impressive, with the chef coming to our table to cook it
4
Was the first to arrive at White Rabbit on a Saturday morning and was warmly welcomed by the staff. We ordered the egg benedict as well as the Scrambled Eggs with truffle and mushrooms as well as the mac and cheese with truffle. The food portion was generous and the food was really rich and good. We have been here on a few occasions before but stopped coming as we felt that the price vs the food quality didn't match. I have to say that there has been much improvements since and despite the food still being pricey, at least the taste was really good. Overall atmosphere was also nice. A good place for special occasions
5
If you are going to go to The White Rabbit, then you already know you are going to pay a pretty penny for the food, so I will skip that.The venue in the old chapel is great indoors and outdoors. There is an outdoor patio with tables to enjoy a more natural feel. Inside the restaurant has high ceilings, and the restaurant seems to be divided into a section for smaller groups and one for larger groups. My girlfriend and I felt this added to the romantic feel of the restaurant.The service was great. The staff was attentive, helpful, and yet not overbearing.The food was good. While not the best meal of our lives, neither my girlfriend nor I was disappointed with any of the dishes on the 5-course dinner menu currently on offer.The wine list was comprehensive, with many options in terms of both taste and price.If you are looking for a quiet date spot with good food and good service, then definitely consider The White Rabbit
2
Not only did the staff not respond as we would expect for the price when we pointed out that my husbands steak was served cold, but when i left a review on tripadvisor and, as they asked, took the time to respond to the email address on their standard response, there was absolutely no email in return. no apology. nothing. disappointing to have such poor care for their customers
2
While an interesting location, it's quickly minimized by the sluggish service, expensive menu, and mediocre food. I had high hopes for this place, but in the end left with resentment and disappointment. I have eaten better quality food at cheaper establishments.The ribeye was fattier then expected and lacked flavor. The pasta with crab was soupy and watery, and failed to meet expectations. The deconstructed cheesecake did not taste anything like a cheesecake, and failed as well. Lastly the service was slow and took nearly three hours from start to finish. Recommendation is to come here and grab a drink but don't stay for the food.
5
I just wanted to commend the entire team for truly great dining experience. I must say that the food and service were both outstanding. So many restaurants don't have the "complete package" of great quality of food, and great service. I don't remember the last time our expectations as guest in a restaurant were not just met... But exceeded.We had Wagyu carpaccio as starter, shortribs for main, Mac and cheese as side Plantagenet Chardonnay wine as well as partner oyster, seabream and a glass of champagne. This food and drinks was recommended by our server John. John was knowledgeable, friendly, and genuinely hospitable. Excellent service! This is my first time dining at the white rabbit and my friend and I agreed it was the best restaurant we've dined at in Singapore. I just wanted to write to thank u all for the incredible dining experience because so often. The food and the excellent service were both incredible. Thank you and we will most certainly dine with you all again soon
5
Great service was only the prelude to the wonderland of tastes and textures we enjoyed at White Rabbit. Without doubt the best meal I've ever had.
5
Distinguishing Food. Alluring Ambiance. Professional Service. Recommended if you want to be a great host to friends and partners.
5
Went with 2 friends for a birthday celebration. Service was excellent. Every service staff was very attentive. They were generous with our birthday request. Food was delicious. The whole experience is simply remarkable. We will go back again.
5
We were greeted by the manager while driving to the carpark as there was a excursion in the opposite school. He directed us to the carpark ahead. After we enter the restaurant the staff was very professional and helpful. Overall the food were excellent and tasty. I will recommend this restaurant to my family and friends

Visited the White Rabbit for a special night out and found the experience was the only real disappointment in our fives days in Singapore. I think some reviewers have either hyped the experience or simply had better luck with their visit. The food we had was good - unlike some guests who have said their meal was average, and the location great, our experience was the reverse. Location was fine (but truly not that unique or distinctive) though the food was very nice and well prepared. The service was good but slightly frosty and 'disinterested', which was unusual. Positives: they mix a nice martini, the food (short-ribs and wild mushroom ravioli were excellent). Negatives: chilly service, high prices comparable with other similar restaurants in Singapore
5
Were there for brunch on Saturday with the in laws and some good friends. The place was very easy to find. Reception, food, beverage, ambience and service were great. We could not find any faults while we were there. All stuff were friendly and helpful. Well, at least those ones who served us. The price were reasonable. For 6 adults and one baby, it was around 230euro. We left the place very satisfied. We highly recommend it to any who visiting Singapore
3
The quality of foods, service, atomosphor in the restusrant are very good. Especially the demo of CrÃªpe Suzette was entertained us a lot.However, if you have more reasonal & casual wine choices and the price of dishes is more reasonal, the overall experience will become very good or excellent
4
I recommend this place for a romantic dinner, thanks to its history and beautiful decor. Nevertheless, I think they could improve their menu; every plate seems to have truffle in it. Despite that, the Wagyu Carpaccio, Macaroni and Cheese & Lemon Tart were really good! The service is also excellent. Actually, the best part was the wine; they have a vast menu with great options. We had "The winery of good hope" and it was delicious.
5
Overall, we had a wonderful Easter at The White Rabbit. The staff were amazing and were really good with all of the children. The White Rabbit made Easter magical by providing the children with bunny ears and tails, story time, bouncy castle and candy floss. The food was lovely and was enjoyed by everyone at our table. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
5
Hubby and I have been dining very often at Dempsey Hill, passed by White Rabbit a few times and decided to have dinner there last Saturday night. We ordered Beef Carpaccio and Salad for appetizers, Lamb Chop and Short Rib for our mains. The Carpaccio and Short Rib are so delicious that we have immediately decided to put White Rabbit as one of our favorite restaurants. Our wine compliments the food very well too, staff Andrew's excellent service made us start thinking what to order for our next visit at White Rabbit, We'll certainly be back :
3
Food is good and well presented.
Only small issue regarding the speed of service. The restaurant was being prepared for an event at night and we had to wait more than 30minutes everytime between courses.
5
A nice compliment to all the fabulous hawker food in Singapore, this fine dining restaurant is stunning as it a converted church with incredible stained glass windows and a refined atmosphere. The food was excellent, and the wine selection extensive - definitely worth a visit.
4
Magnificent setting within an old church sets the scene for a romantic evening. Whilst the food may not match the setting it is none the less a memorable venue and worth trying.
4
The White Rabbit has always been name-dropped here and there as serving good food but I never had the chance to visit because of its (past?) infamous 2-weeks-in-advance reservations requirements. It is located in a beauitfully-restored old chapel building at Dempsey area, directly opposite Au Petit Salut. They maintained the stained glass windows and rustic doors, replacing the pews with comfortable booths or tables, transforming the place into a mysterious yet intimate dining haven.After browsing through the menu, I decided to go for the Set Dinner (SGD$98.00++ for 4 course). For my set, I chose the Seared Bay Scallops as my starter, served with sweet shallot confit, white chocolate veloute and sevruga caviar. The white chocolate veloute (the foamy broth surrounding the scallops) was awesome, subtly sweet and complementing the bouncy fresh scallops perfectly.Then I had the Sauteed Foie Gras for appetiser, served with quince puree, roasted pear and spiced sherry gastrique. The butter-like piece of foie gras disintegrated deliciously in the mouth upon contact, spreading over the palate thickly with its rich flavor. It was a superb starter.My selected main course was the 36-Hour Brandt Shortribs, with truffle miso glaze, parsnip puree, field mushrooms and shaved truffles. The crispy exterior was easily torn apart to make way for contact with a succulent interior of fine red meat, so lean and tender. Mushrooms and truffles gave the bittersweet meat a lovely touch of enhancement; it was a beautiful concoction.Finally, time for my dessert - for this, I had the Crepe Suzette, where there was a flambeed tableside performance the service crew prepared the dessert right in front of us. The warm crepes were drenched in an orangey sauce, so they were infused deliciously in a citrusy flavor; the texture was pulpy pieces of flour (good flour); when paired with the vanilla ice-cream it was incredible.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/04/dinner-at-white-rabbit-dempsey.htm

The location is superb and the building itself is truly stunning. A converted church for what must have been the British army barracks back in the day, they ambiance of the hotel is one of th best in Singapore. Our starters were as good as I have had in Singapore and my main of pork belly with truffle mash was just Devine. My wife tied to order the sole but they were out which was odd given that we were first sitting and so she ordered the spatchcock which came out undercooked and quite frankly was at best a slightly salty roast chicken. Not good. The desserts however were just wonderful. I do love the place and the staff are excellent but not to have a main on a limited menu is not good and the spatchcock is not something that I recommend, certainly not a scratch on the rest of the food. The truffle mash though was something special and I could have eaten it by the plateful.
4
I have read about the White Rabbit from some magazines and decided to check it out.Went there for lunch and ordered their 3 course set lunch.Verdict: You come here for the ambience, not the food.Ambience - conversion from a chapel. Nice architecture. I guess it would be even nicer in the evening when the lights are on.Food - taste average. portion a little small.Service - they tried to cope. average
5
This place is a great setting: the converted chapel is a lovely airy space but with plenty of detail and charm. In particular the semi-circular banquettes provide a very nice space to dine. The menu was fairly traditional but nonetheless very enticing. I chose the seared and smoked foie gras and duck breast to start. It was presented in a small bell jar filled with herb smoke which imbued it with a delightful light smoked flavour without overpowering it. As a main I had the Rack of Lamb which had an excellent flavour and was cooked to perfection. The lemon meringue tart to finish was equally good with an excellent balance and texture.The wine list offered a good selection of wines with a sensible range of prices. It was also divided into broad wine types and ordered in ascending price, making choosing the right wine pretty easy.Service was generally pleasant and friendly but felt a little haphazard. It seemed that the staff were operating on a pooled basis rather than having one person responsible for looking after our table. Maybe it needs slightly better coordination.Finally, there's the website. My advice is to use the mobile website which seems to work well, because the full site is really silly and difficult to use... But don't let it put you off, this is an excellent restaurant and we'll certainly be back
5
This restaurant is located in the converted chapel of the barracks at Dempsey hill, now all converted into interesting shops and restaurants and frequented by mainly an expat population.The restaurant itself is large and airy with comfortable banquette seating around the sides. The owners have retained enough of the ' old world' charm for the original architecture to shine through.The food was delicious, I can particularly recommend the Waygu carpaccio and the 36 hour short rib, which were melt in the mouth gorgeous.Two small downsides:The service was slow and a little haphazard, although the staff were charming when they came to us I felt they lacked direction, no floor manager seemed to be in evidence.The toilets needed a good clean - this is unusual in Singapore where most loos are immaculate.The restaurant isn't cheap but well worth a visi
1
I invited a special guest to your restaurant and as it turned out I treated her to experience two courses that were served with live bugs on the the food. I did not even hear "I am sorry" from the staff. The rest of the experience was consistent. Embarrassment! No more need be said.
3
Decoration of the venue is very nice, but the food for me was disappointing, I've ordered for my main course a 60-hour Braised Mangalica Pork Belly which I was very excited about until it arrived and I cut a bit, turn out to be just very tiny little meat and the rest just fat. I ate quite a few pork belly in a different restaurants and that one in The white rabbit was the worst one ever.The other food which my friends ordered was good but not amazing for the price you pay
4
I took 3 colleagues here for dinner. The service was very good overall. We had the fixed price menu and all was excellent. This is a great restaurant - highly recommended - and a nice interior.
5
The White RabbitWe had our family dinner at The White Rabbit on Sunday, 15/3/2015.We were served by Adrian Chan and his team of courteous and friendly staff. They were very attentive at all times.The ambience is very suitable for fine dining.Great food served with reasonable prices. Compliments to Adrian Chan; Jack; Ann; Edwin and all staff of The White Rabbit.Thank you for the great service
2
The place was totally crowded (cause the food is pretty good and the location is interesting!) but therefore very noisy. Theres nothing to "buffer" the sound there. We couldnt even hear each other speak across the table. really noisy. and my husband got a not very warm steak. he sent it back. in the meantime, my food got cold. there was an apology but no other compensation of any sort. The food was pretty good, but nothing special really.
3
I was hesitating between a Poor and an Average. On the positive side...the decor is spectacular . The restaurant is located in an ancient Chapel, benefits from a bar opening to a nice garden. The waiters are nice and obviously trying their best. But the rest is frankly very disappointing ...one of those restaurants where you know that there is no leadership.. And execution is very poor. My Wagyu burger was very bad , tasted awful, undercooked ..several items were missing from the menu ( not one dish but several ..from a relatively small menu ?) ..wine list needs some serious advice.. No bread ?! Just toasted white bread ? Could be a phenomenal place but in fact the whole thing is so chaotic that the experience is very disappointing. Poor value . Going downhill
4
I went there with my wife during Valentine's day. A nice place with a good meal. There is a small garden behind the restaurant, you could hang out there, play with the swing and relax. I saw a few guys doing their proposal in this place, the ambiance definitely helps a lot.Overall a good dining experience. Just remember to make a reservation before going for the meal. They have a very limited seats inside the main hall, so you really need to book in advance
5
Best meal I had in Singapore.All the dishes we ordered were mouth-watering and deliciously amazing. The ravioli melted in your mouth and the 36-hour Brandt short ribs were pleasing to my taste buds - perfect combination of crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. And can't forget the dessert! We ordered the chocolate fondant and it was a great way to end our meal. The experience was simply amazing and I highly recommend this place. I will make sure to come back when I got back to Singapore
4
Easy on line experience to book a table at short notice for Saturday night . Restaurant surprisingly not full. Interesting location (formerly a church) and atmosphere good.Not very big menu , but certainly enough options. 3 of us had the Rib Eye and all thought it was excellent. Desserts fantastic. We went a la carte , and it was expensive but worthwhile , and i would assume the set menus would be good value.Service was very good..but not excellent. Had to "arm wave" a couple of times when with a half full restaurant , it would be pretty easy to see plates needed clearing , orders taken . Having said that all the staff was very helpful and friendly. We will go back
5
Having read a lot of online reviews, what we experienced was more than what we expected. We had the 3-course set lunch, and it was divine! The service was also impeccable. Time magazine was definitely correct in including The White Rabbit in its "Top 10 Must-Do Things in Singapore.
5
1st time went to the white rabbit. The environment was nice and not noisy. Ambience was good and most important of all, the food was fantastic. The bread was served warm and the fish was good and soft even after grilled. The dessert hot lava was not too sweet and taste really delicious 
4
We really enjoyed our dinner there. The scenery is awesome, very well decorated and feels cosy. The service was fluid and efficient. Attention is brought to details and the presentation of the dishes were refined and excellent. We took a starter to share, the burrata which was fresh and well presented, to follow I had the pork ribs that were perfectly cooked and a side order of truffle fries. To finish we had dessert and there again we were impressed with the presentation. A really good table in Singapore worth every penny
4
the ambience is impressive esp at night but service staff are largely unattentive and the service charge is exorbitant. dinner for 4 plus wine came close to 600 after gst+service
4
Delicious steaks, salad and soup!!! Place was really nice and cozy. A bit pricey though but must try.
4
Been here twice this year, both times its been really great. Superb service and food quality in a special atmosphere - old chapel. Its a bit away from central Singapore but worth that extra minutes in a cab or car. Really great!!
4
Dinner with the family recently was wonderful. Ambience was great and the old Chapel made the meal feel like an event. Service was very good, and certainly a standout for this restaurant. Welcoming, friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, informative, and recommendations were particularly enjoyable. Our table had the 4 course set, and I had the carpaccio and ribeye. The food was well presented and served, and a pleasurable experience. The recommended wine a fitting complement. I recommend this restaurant without hesitation
5
My dinner experience at The White Rabbit is really amazing. The staff is friendly and when you asked them on the option they will be able to give you a detail information on the food like ingredient used and method of cooking, to help you decide on your option. I went there with 3 of my friends for dinner, we order from their Prix Fixe Menu. The food presentation is very nice and the taste of the food is incredible it is as amazing as it looks, got to try their 36hrs Brandt short ribs, sautÃ©ed foie gras and their crepes Suzette it is really really good.The ambiance is cozy and romantic, they have booth seating at the side and the tables are not close together hence you will have the privacy, they have a nice and quite outdoor area whereby you can chill out with your friends for drinks, we tried their signature drink Black forest Mojito it is refreshing. The price it is reasonable and it is value for money, for a 5 course menu it is at $128++. I would definitely come again!!! Great Job to the team at the White Rabbit
5
The place was just excellent.The waiters provided great service and explained how the food was prepared and what the ingredients were. The Rangers Valley Wagyu Carpaccio is just heaven. I tried also the Dorper Lamb Rack which was very soft and chewy. The Pumpkin Risotto was very tasteful and the Truffle Mac & Cheese is just very crunchy. It was also my first time to try a Deconstructed Cheesecake. It was an interesting way to present a cheesecake. All in all, the experience was excellent. Will definitely come back and eat here again
5
Went there for lunch, although there werent a wide selection on the menu but everything on it looks appetizing, and it turned out great from the looks to its taste. Great atmosphere and the sitting could accommodate any occasion since its so spaced out, staff were attentive, would definitely dine here again. Not a local, so I guess the only way getting there is by taxi?
5
Loved the short ribs and desserts are fantastic. Warm and romantic ambience. The service staff were attentive and customized our dessert knowing that we are celebrating our anniversary at the restaurant. They took effort to make our visit a special one. My Fiance made a proposal to me with the help of the service team and it was prefect. Definitely will come back again
5
Great experience starts from moment reservation making online. They took note of my brief remark at reservation - stating it's my friend's birthday; whereby my friend's dish was served with special decorated and candle, which I never even mentioned anything upon arrival. It was really a pleasant surprise to my friend and myself! Luv it! Definitely will come back again.
5
Located where was formerly a church, this restaurant is not only original, but offers high quality meals. We chose a four course menu that began with a "printemps salad" (green leaves, tomatoes, avocado and mango), followed by foie gras with pear and a soft and memorable rib with mushrooms. The dessert was a "crepe suzette" freshly prepared at the table side by an expert waiter. Everything delicious and impeccably served
5
Dining at the white rabbit was amazing. Extremely responsive and friendly staff. Would definitely dine again.
5
everything was perfect, the food was excellent, nice ambience, Alice in wonderland themed restaurant in a 1940 church, with great service. The whole experience was awesome..
4
Great food and just the atmosphere we were looking for.
It was a struggle for us to eat enough to get value for money on the set menu but we did our best...some family members better than others! It was a special day for us.
5
I had my anniversary lunch with my wife still the white rabbit and the experience was amazing. They served awesome food that gave us a totally new dining experience with the unique way of cooking their dishes. You'll be pleasantly caught by surprise.
4
Dining experience here is incredible. Though the food and service is seriously lacking, admittedly it was still an enjoyable experience; mainly due to the majestic ambiance. I was simply in awe of the surroundings, making the dinner a very relaxing and enjoyably romantic moment with wifey. Don't mind paying more just to have a memorable quality moment minus good food and service
5
I was recommended to White Rabbit by the manager in Overeasy. Bough my wife for a year end dinner and that will soon become our venue of number 1 favorite in Singapore. House in a restored chapel, once you step inside you felt that time has stopped since 1920s. The waiting staffs are friendly, polite and their smiles are welcoming. We are pampered my not just by the service, but what really wow us is their food. We have been in Europe for numerous times, but we have nothing closed to the dishes we had, the Chef is amazing! We only managed to covered 1/3 of the menu and we are determine to go back again to complete the menu.
4
The old church building located near Dempsey and Botanical Garden houses and an interesting restaurant that offers great quality food with a twist. They can cater to bigger groups (I was guest at a corporate event) and have some festive menu offers for Xmas and NY. We had our Xmas dinner at WR and we were very happy. The food was gorgeous and the wine pairing was ok (One champagne is enough guys ;-)Despite the substantial price tag (4digit for a group of 4) I am still a big fan of this venue. Especially for romantic dates or other significant events. Friends told me that they also have a good lunch weekdays.Nowadays service always seems to be an issue in this country. At that price tag you might train your local part timers a bit harder. Also, if you don't understand Singlish you might be lost
2
We have eaten here many times. Have brought many colleagues....my husband even hired the whole restaurant for their work Xmas function last week. All been great..... BUT...We booked Xmas lunch with a group of friends.... 6 of us. Was happy to provide credit card details as 'holding' deposit. To be taken only If we were a 'no show' on the day.... I checked on Xmas morning, and the money had been taken from our card by PayPal...and showed it was paid to White Rabbit......Buffet lunch was enjoyable. As busy as you would expect at Xmas. Lunch was not cheap....we had multiple bottles of bubbles, wine, cocktails.... All good.THEN came to settling the bill.....I noticed that they had not deducted the deposit...$300.... From our bill, and asked them to do so. I was told it was 'just a holding deposit...not actually taken from your account'. I showed my bank details, and refused to pay whole amount.... Eventually we were allowed to pay our account, minus the $300. Both parties agreed to check bank account, and we agreed that once the fee was reimbursed to us, we would call and pay White Rabbit.Yesterday my husband was contacted by White a Rabbit, and was told that they had not received the money from paypal, so were deducting it from my card!!!!!As of today the money has NOT been reimbursed to us.... Yet we are to be charged it again????I am SO disappointed with this service. We spent $2000+ on this meal.... Now this experience has been ruined, and our opinion of one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore is tainted.Come on White Rabbit. Sort this mess out
4
We went to White Rabbit to celebrate Christmas. The food is as good as we expected. There's a wide selection on the menu, from starters to desserts. They have attentive and friendly staff. We enjoyed every single second we spent in this restaurant. You must try their cheesecake, it's the best cheesecake I've ever tasted
1
Terrible food, noisy ambience, expensive basically sums it up.I went there on christmas eve with my girlfriend. We paid 300+ for the dinner.Food is below average and the portion is super small even as a fine dining course. tables were placed closely in the restaurant and no privacy at all. you can clearly hear the conversation beside, behind and in front of u.not recommended
5
From start to finish staff were great. Not rushing as we enjoyed our bottle of bubbly & then helping us with our food & wine choices. Only downer...the chatter noise level, but that's a cultural & acoustic issue.
4
Excellent food, great choice of wines. Ambience was nice. The staff were very friendly & attentive. We'd definitely go again for special occasions
2
Like everyone, we read the reviews on The White Rabbit, as a 'must dine' experience in Singapore, unfortunately, I would have to rank it more as a 'don't spend the money, don't waste your time' restaurant, what with all the other restaurants on offer in Singapore. Despite the reviews, unfortunately the food did not deliver as it should based on the high prices charged. With a group of 4 persons, I chose 2 items that I would say, 'don't bother'. Both needed spice to enhance the tastes as both were quite bland. The starter portion of the Linguine with King Crab actually didn't have any crab that I could see with the naked eye, cheaters brought a few small pieces to the forefront, the quantity of crab fit into the size of a thimble, hardly gourmet or worth 30 Sinapore Dollars. And the truffle mashed potatoes, came out lukewarm. They did provide another portion, but it needed some spice to round out the bland flavors, and we are talking truffles here. My dining companions fared better with their meals of their choice. The staff was very attentive and professional, though it would be expected with so many of them on hand. While I will choose not to dine there again, given my desire to explore the thousands of other unique restaurants in Singapore, if you do choose to give it a try, go with low expectations, and you may not fall down the rabbit hole and be disappointed
5
Came with an oversea friend for dinner, great vibs with loads of energy, was busy, had some of their seasons oyster and White pearl as starter, was great, succulent and juicy. Beef carpaccio and Hamachi were great, flavoursome and well done. Main was their 60 hours pork belly and lamb, both so good. Had some wonderful cocktail curated by them which was refreshing (Blackforest Mojito and Espresso Martini). Order wines by the glass and was amaze with them using Coravin (wine preservative system). Kudos to the team for making my dinner an amazing memorable. I shall be back to my favourite restaurant in Singapore. Service was seamless and professional and the staff knows they product very well....
2
Brought a group of friends there to have dinner, full of excitement and expectation. But we were totally disappointed in the end and we won't go again. First the oyster we had was bad, full of sand and nobody apologize for that when we complained. What kind of service it is? we have never eaten oyster in restaurant with sand as an addtional texture added to it.Then, the mains we ordered making us waited for 45 mins and after complained all the food arrived the table and they were all half warm half cold. It is reasonable to speculate that someone holding our food without delivering (the reason should be related with the oysters, or just because we are not local). The taste of the dishes were not good.

We chose the White Rabbit because it was (1) veggie friendly - one in our party is vegetarian and that is always a challenge if you don't want crappy local or a salad bar and (2) it served cocktails during brunch - it was also her birthday. Most of us ended up ordering the Fry Up which had a good slab of thick cut bacon and some nice sausages. The poached egg option should have come served on English muffins instead of soggy bread though (too much bread though I understand it was to to soak up the water). Cocktails were good - I had the Espresso martini, and you can order off the dinner drinks menu if request for it - the berry mojito was amazing. Their Deconstructed Cheesecake was good, not amazing - it didn't have enough of a cheesecake flavour to it not enough graham cracker crumbs. I'm not a big fan of Bread & Butter pudding but those who were sang its praises and it was huge so! I'm definitely going back to for dinner

Hosted a small business dinner here, which was recommended by a colleague. I checked the reviews and looked forward to a really fine dining experience.The place itself was impressive, with a great ambience created by converting an old church into the restaurant. The stained glass windows and high arched ceilings were still intact, lending a real charm to the place.The wine list was impressively wide and with some interesting selections. After several minutes of scanning the list, I finally settled for an Italian Barolo, only to be told after several more minutes that it was out of stock. This is not the first time I've experienced this, and I really wish restaurants would put a sticker to indicate if the wine was out of stock so as not to raise expectations and then waste people's time. Anyway, the sommelier was helpful and suggested an equally priced French that was very good.The food was for the most part very good with complements all around from my guests. We ordered the Foie Gras and soup for starters, and for mains, we had the Japanese Sea Bream, Dover Sole, 36-hour Brandy short ribs, Dorper Lamb Rack and the Pot Roasted Spatchcock. It was only the spatchcock, which was my order that was disappointing - rather watery stew that was rather bland. I've tasted better.Dessert was also good for the most part, except for my order again, the cheese platter, which should have been the simplest and fastest, and yet took even longer than Chocolate Fondant, which they warned would take 10 minutes. The cheese finally came after 15 minutes, and I was already quite annoyed by that time, though remained calm, being the host of the dinner.So in summary, there were some very good points, which really should be expected from a highly rated French Restaurant in Singapore like this, but it fell short of the mark in a few critical areas, unfortunately

We were immediately impressed with the layout and ambience of this restaurant. It is exceedingly well run with the waiting staff moving very efficiently without being noticed. We were welcomed, seated and handed menus in a very friendly way - hey I think they were actually pleased to see the customers! The foie gras starter was a delight, cooked brilliantly and presented with pride.Our main course was also excellent and the service attentive. At various tables waiting staff were filleting sole, carving roasts, preparing crepes all contributing to an enjoyable restaurant atmosphere. Our thanks for a first class dining experience

Went for dinner here with my partner. Fell in love with the place instantly. We were seated at a booth seat at the corner. Came at around 9pm. The place was quite busy on that night however the staff were attentive enough that it is very easy to catch their attention whenever we needed something. Lobster bisque was abit salty but still good. The beef carpaccio was just so delicious. We both love it very much. I then had the ravioli for the mains and my partner, the shortribs. The staff did a great job by assisting my partner with a suprise dessert for our anniversary as well. I really didnt saw that coming. Special thanks to Leslie, one of the staff who assisted us with our wine orders and food orders. Such a pity we didnt get to go to the bar outdoors as it was quite full on that night. However, we really really enjoyed our dining experience and we look forward to coming back soon. Thanks again

I was waiting for my friends at the Bar and wanted to be surprised with an original vodka martini. Well, I was extremely pleased with a Sour Apple Martini. It was simply delicious.We moved to our table. We started with duck liver pate which was nicely presented and perfect to finish our cocktails. To follow we ordered 60hrs pork belly and 36 pork ribs. Both dishes were very tasty and I strongly recommend them.I love the setting of the place. Simple and elegant. Definitely I will come back.
5
I was get my first time to this restaurant on18.Nov. I took long time to find it.It's so difficult to find it. Except this reason,actually overall is much better.I would like to come again,next time I know how to go.
5
Food was amazingly delicious, we had beef carpaccio, lobster bisque, Dover Sole, Braised Pork Belly and the finisher was a crepe suzette on the table side. The rare table side show was captivating. Not only food impress us, the service was impeccable, gonna give 2 thumbs up for Mr Adrian! The wine selections were beautifully crafted and not overwhelmed by big names. Huellas, the Spanish wine recommended. We did not waste a single drop. If I'm given a chance to choose a restaurant to have my last meal, it got to be White Rabbit.

From the moment you step into White Rabbit to the time that you leave, be prepared to be pampered. White Rabbit excels in service. Nothing is ever too much trouble for the team of ultra-attentive staff.The menu is elegantly sufficient, with more than enough choice to tickle the fancy of the most discerning dinner - even if you are on a limited budget. The portions are substantial - in some cases substantial enough to share, which is recommendedWhite Rabbit is my idea of food heaven. It has made dining out as simple as possible, but not simpler. I recommend it highly.@TheKuoKnow
5
Excellent service (the waiter there were all very nice and polite), and excellent food (tastes good, and the price is just right for such a good quality meal). The atmosphere there is really good too! that restaurant is perfect if you wanna bring your date to celebrate your anniversary, or birthdays. If you are feeling rich, u can bring ur date there for just a normal date too. You may sit at the inside or the outside of the restaurant (Either sides are also very cosy and romantic). me and my other friend brought another one of our friend there to celebrate her birthday last week and she was really really happy about that place and she really loved it.One point about White rabbit is, it's not easily accessible. thats all :)But i will definitely go there again!! :
5
We celebrated my sister's 24th birthday in this restaurant. The service is very high end, the bread simply amazing and the interior very sophisticated. We would recommend to reserve a table in advance as the restaurant was quite crowded.Great stay, we will come again for sure :
4
The restaurant is converted from a church. We had one of our company dinner here and booked the place to ourselves. Drinks started outside in the gardens which is pleasant. Food was good. Special dishes were made for colleagues who are vegetarian and gluten-free.Transport may be a problem (I only see taxis picking-up people).Our group chartered a bus to drop and pick us up
4
We treated ourselves to and excellent dinner at The White Rabbit recently. Reservations were made online and away we went down the rabbit hole :DThe ambiance of the restaurant is second to none. A converted church, the high ceilings, lighting and stained glass windows paved the way for what was to be a romantic dinner for two. (mission accomplished, heheheh)The food had it's hits and misses, more of the former thankfully; rather than the latter. It's located in a quieter part of town, so getting a cab ride back to your hotel may be a bit tricky after dinner.All in all, the excellent service and the friendly wait staff made our dining experience there a memorable one
4
I simply must thank you for the excellent service I received while dinning at your stablishment last week.. Your staff went above and beyond to make sure our experience was the best it could be. I was really empressed by your sommelier Jayden for the wine recommendation even I just wanted a wine by the glass. As well as John for the good service that he gave to us.it is service like this that will keep us coming back to your restaurant again and again
4
Thoroughly enjoyed the hospitality of the sommelier Jayden Lam who gave helpful recommendations for our family of three. The baked aubergine was so delicious that my teenager who usually doesn't eat aubergine had a generous helping of it. She thought it was mushroom! The truffle chicken is subtle and tender. I found the truffle sauce a tad salty, but my family loved it. The ribeye is alright and they were v flexible to have half of it done differently when we told them we are sharing and have different preferences. We ended dinner with a baked Alaska, which is cleverly done with a melt-in-your-mouth meringue that topped the vanilla cake. The lighting is romantic in the chapel setting with high ceiling and stained glass. Can imagine how beautiful it will be in the day, with the garden and canopied 'Rabbit Hole'. I like the clever use of references to Alice in Wonderland with a Drink Up bar and name cards that resemble a card deck. The service is attentive and helpful, which made this evening a lovely and enjoyable one.
5
This is truly an awesome fine dining restaurant. Their lobster bisque and dover sole is a MUST TRY!! Its so rich in aroma and taste, that you'll never regret for trying it. Not to forget the services provided by their friendly staff and especially the sommelier, whom keeps you well informed for each and every of the wine pairing. You guys rocks! We'll for sure be back on our next visit, hope to see you all again! Thanks White Rabbit for providing us an unforgettable dining experiences in SIngapore
5
Really great experience with great food and service. Really nice place and definitely coming back again!
4
Great ambience, foods, and service! Too bad Baked Alaska was not available when i went there :(. But overall i would visit again.
4
If you a quaint ambiance and desserts prepared in front of you.. Here's the place to go.. But if you need bright lights while dining, not recommended.
3
i was here to celebrate my girlfriend birthday. it was an excellent environment with candle dinner and their services was also good. however, when we order the salad, pasta and their pork chop, i found it was very salty and i cannot stop drinking water after finished the food
4
The first thing about The White Rabbit apart from the picturesque venue was the friendly and thoughtful service. I reserved a spot for my fiances birthday and they even had a happy birthday message with the dessert we ordered.Lovely food, great atmosphere and a very warm experience
3
Set in an old church on Dempsey Hill the grounds and space are well set out and the staff attentive. Unfortunately the food was uninteresting and served very plainly. The rib eye steak was only 3/16 of an inch thick and served with 8 baby spinach leaves. To be fair the steak was cooked as ordered but totally flavorless. Very disappointing for the price
5
First impressions last. Despite a mix up with the reservation (I was sure I had booked for Saturday but they had us down for Friday - hence a no show - and they had sent me an SMS confirming my reservation for FRIDAY which I never read!) they seated us at the bar and sorted out a table within a matter of minutes. An superb menu gets the juices flowing and makes choosing difficult but nothing disappointed. Lobster bisque and crispy duck leg starters got us going (with and accompaniment of cocktails) followed by 36 hour braised beef short rib and a lamb rack, all of which were outstanding. Alas the first two courses were substantial so we were unable to experience the deserts despite drooling over the offerings. Excellent service, great atmosphere, don't rush! Cost for 3: S$350Time: 2hoursLeave the mobile phones at home. There is nothing more sad than seeing faces buried in technology it a location like this.
4
Lovely setting and the food was excellent. We went for the tasting menu, which was good value for money, including a different wine with each course.There is also a great outside space with a bar to relax and have a cocktail afterwards.Also, for Singapore, the service was good
4
The ambient is great,nice place for dinner,The Mangalica Pork Collar was very delicious.Love the presentation of the food especially Crêpes Suzette and baked Alaska.However there is miscommunication with the staff which cause slight unhappiness.I call to reserve a table in the afternoon and pre ordered a birthday dessert with a request of the birthday name on it.I have double check the name to be written with the reservation staff and he has noted my request. However when we were going to celebrate the birthday with the pre orderd dessert,the dessert is served without the name,just the happy birthday word.I feedback to the staff,and the staff replied saying that i did not mention the name to be written during the pre ordered.I hope the management will do something with this incident and not repeat the same again for future consumer as this suppose to be a birthday surprise
4
Overall good experience.Food was good and service was eexcellent.Drinks on the pricey side.Enjoyed after dinner drinks at the Rabbit Hole  
5
Everything about The White Rabbit is just so perfect. A little piece of heaven on earth. Awesome food, service and ambiance. Must try are Wagyu Carpaccio, Brandt Shortribs, truffled Mac and Cheese with Mushroom and Baked Alaska for dessert.
4
Pan seared foie gras was good, served w the salt cured foie gras which was way to salty... think needs some more crisps or berry compote to go with it. Beef carparico was just nice on the seasoning. Truffle free range chicken was good, king crab tagliatelle barely had much crab, was tasty... my favourite was the braised short ribs... nice complex flavours and texture of the meat was just about falling off the bone without being too mushy and soft.. still had bite...the mash that came with it was good as well. Mac n cheese on the side was quite yummy but I was absolutely stuffed cos the portions were generous! Didn't try the desserts cos we had birthday cake brought in and really too full to eat try anything...will be back one day to try the crepe suzette :)
3
We love the White Rabbit; atmosphere gets an A+. Service was great this night as well. The rack of lamb was bad; flavor was OK but an extremely fatty cut of meat that almost didn't seem like lamb. The lobster bisque was nothing like I remembered from prior visit in July. Just average. Slow cooked ribs also seemed a lesser version from what I remembered. We will go back, as ambiance is (for us) more important than food, and I'm hoping this was an aberration. 
5
There are not many venues in Sg that one can call charming as many of the older buildings have been torn down. Located in an old church, this restaurant creates a unique ambience that might be considered "casual" fine dining. Food was excellent-particularly the lamb. The soufflÃ© also is very special. Very attentive but unpretentious service.
4
Made a reservation here for my sister's birthday on a Friday evening. It was reasonably packed but at no point of time, did our party of 3 feel rushed or crowded. Tables were spaced out nicely and the high roof added to the spacious ambiance. The waitstaff were brilliant - they were attentive without having to hover over our shoulders. Do try the basil tomato (I hope I got it right) bread from the bread basket. Was downright delish. We had the Wagyu Cote De Beuf (split among us as it was a huge portion) which I enjoyed even though I am not a big beef fan. Be prepared to wait though. The Sauteed Mushroom were melt in the mouth tender and the perfect accompaniment to the beef. A must try is the white chocolate souffle. One of the best desserts I have ever had. We proceeded to the Rabbit Hole behind for after dinner drinks. It did look like Wonderland, with the fairy lights and garden furniture. A good selection of drinks was on offer and service was impeccable. Definitely foresee making a trip there in future
5
Wed evening, place was reasonably full but nobody rushed us. We were left alone to enjoy our aperitifs before being ushered to our table, which was switched due to an overly tall friend. Staff were friendly & knowledgeable. I'd emailed an enquiry about vegetarian options & the waiter made it a point to come talk to us about what could be done. The wine I wanted wasn't available for the year stated but the alternate was great. Same price though, which I felt was wrong. Steaks, bisques, lamb & vegetarian options were all equally satisfying. A pricey establishment but worth it.
4
A beautiful and simple church turned restaurant ! We stopped in for a lite bite and the amazing Mojitos made from mint grown in the garden in the garden bar just outside. We met the General Mgr and he gave us the back story on how the restaurant has come to be and hinted at the Alice in Wonderland magic including a true rabbit hole in the garden. The only reason I gave it four stars is we did not have a full entree but appetizers that were very good. We will spread the word and will be back again
4
The food is not the best in Singapore but the place is just nice and cosy so I love bringing guests there. It is quite relaxed that you can enjoy a long meal with your friends while having decent food.I've been here for both brunch and dinner and their menu selection is quite ok. For lunch I had the lobster omelette which was a good serving of lobster and a side of truffle fries. Their truffles fries is served with some shaved truffles and not just sprinkled with truffle oil unlike other restaurants. For dessert, we had the bread pudding which was quite good but the serving was huge -- good for at least 4 people.Lastly, there is ample parking..
5
I have no idea why there are so many negative reviews on the HungryGoWhere, but from my personal experience, the White Rabbit service and cuisine really made my day! Food is awesome and the atmosphere is epic
5
We were here with my friends during a vacation in Singapore. I contacted them prior to my arrival, and they would respond quickly to my queries. We arrived at the restaurant few minutes before the opening hours, and I was surprised that they let us sit inside the restaurant. The manager also talked to us and shared wonderful tips about traveling in Singapore as he knew we were tourists. The service was really good as everyone was courteous. They also serve good food with lovely presentation. This place is a must-try
5
Food was excellent, service amazing, wine list extensive and although the restaurant is slightly out of town (10 - 15 minutes) it was still worth the taxi ride.Food was carefully prepared and beautifully served
4
Attended a wedding brunch this monring. It's a beautiful restaurant in a charming chapel. Excellent service; good food; and nice ambience. Love the crunchy Potato Salads; the sweet Chunky Beet Roots; the freshness of the simmered Sea Bass; the rich & creamy tastes of the Chicken Stew; and of course those lovely mini desserts. My favourite - the White Chocolate Mille Feuille; the Chocolate Tart as well as the Lemongrass Jelly. Would be back for a romantic meal for two. Heard about the crispy duck and ribs
5
Over the past few years, my wife and I have frequently visited the White Rabbit for dinner, sometimes also for brunch, and often to The Rabbit Hole to relax over cocktails and music in the very special outdoor setting. The food, wine/cocktails and service are consistently excellent and the staff are always so very nice! The Rangers Valley Wagyu Carpaccio is the absolute best I have had anywhere in the world and it is exceptionally, consistently perfect! Same for the Lobster Bisque, the Foie Gras, the Asparagus/Truffle/Parmesan Risotto, the Dover Sole Meuniere and the Char Grilled Ribeye, which are just some of our favorites. Everything on the menu is absolutely fantastic!Sometimes you find a place that you deeply enjoy, a place that is so very special, that you may worry that at some point it might disappoint and you'll lose that special place from your life. It's very difficult for a restaurant to be both excellent and consistently so in all aspects. As many times as we have gone to White Rabbit, every time has been a complete delight! We can't wait to go, we always have a great time, and leave deeply happy.The White Rabbit is truly one of the very best restaurants in Singapore and is a MUST visit for anyone that appreciates high quality food, drinks and service
5
Enjoyable set dinner with wine pairing. Good value. Short ribs was delicious, foi gras was very tasty. 4 wines All wonderful.  
4
Setting in an old chapel was serene. We were seated very comfortably in a cosy alcove.Service was attentive albeit not obstrusive.Lunch Menu selection was ample - certain items attract additional charges.Interesting outdoor settings - like a disused cable car. Nice ambience all roun
4
I went to White Rabbit during the World Gourmet Series time.Needless to say, the food was amazing and we even got to chat with the Belgian chef who came out talking to every patron.The location of White Rabbit is beautiful and the staff was friendly. However, the manager who served us need to be mindful of his cigarette smell and brush up on his conversing skills
4
Very pleasant place for dining. Great atmosphere and food. Set lunch is worth it,at <$40 before GST for a 3-course meal. 
5
It's a bit tricky to get there but it is well worth the time and the few extra dollars you will pay. Service is great and the atmosphere fantastic! My girlfriend and I took some photos in the back yard and enjoyed our meals. We spent over 2 hours there and we loved it
5
I loved the dinner, the atmosphere, the service and everything!The price of the food was indeed not your usual hawker fare, but it was worth it because high quality ingredients were used. Thank You White Rabbit for making my Mom's birthday so special! She enjoyed it so much! =
5
Set in a beautifully restored chapel in the lush Dempsey Hill area, you'll need a cab or car to get to The White Rabbit but it will definitely be worth it. The ambiance and service are second to none, and the menu features European classics including a few items with tableside service. Classy yet modern place and great for impressing out of towners or someone special!
5
Highly recommended
The scallops and caviar entree, I am still talking about it!
Great international wines available.
Service impeccable
One of my top 10 restaurants.
2
The location was very good. Secluded from the hustle and bustle of the city in the quiet Dempsey Hill. Nice place to hang out with a group of friends. But the food was far below average and I personally finds it over priced. For the same amount, I could enjoy much better food at another outlet who has a same environment settings too
5
Had a wonderful brunch at White Rabbit. The staff were so attentive and welcoming. White Rabbit is set in a refurbished church, so the atmosphere is great. High ceilings, stained glass windows, etc. The good quality was excellent, and we ate too our full. Prices were a little high, but it was worth the experience. Highly recommended!
4
The White Rabbit is a pretty safe choice for a good meal in a nice venue. We went on a Sunday night and the restaurant was relatively fully. The portion sizes aren't too large which is good. The venue can be a bit noisy being in an old church and the lighting pretty dark. Overall however a safe choice but nothing overly special.
5
The food here is excellent, of cause so are the service. With the help of Kelvin and Ming, they constantly checking on us to make sure we enjoy our night at here and answer to whatever question we have in mind
4
The environment is very cosy, with the friendly service i will definitely come back again. The managers here were so friendly especially the smiles on their face. Their lava cake is the best dessert ever.. it is so tasty and yummy!!
4
The White Rabbit is always a safe choice for special occasions. I've been here for weddings, for cocktails, for dinner, and the food/drinks/service have been consistent. The place is beautiful, a converted chapel, with plenty of space in between tables. Will be back to check out the brunch experience
4
TWR strikes me as having 2 personalities: one is quiet and calm while you're having dinner in the refurb church, while the other is a crazy party mode - most evident during big events like Halloween or New Years! You can easily spend a whole evening here, starting off with al-fresco apertifs, onto a delicious 3-course meal (have to say the desserts were my favorite part), then as the hours move to double digits, out come the shots and mojitos! Well worth a visit, whether you're on a date or a birthday party
1
We fiancÃ© and I wanted to have our wedding dinner at The White Rabbit in October. Therefore, we tried to book parts of the restaurant non-exclusively for the evening. Within the process of booking starting in May we talked and wrote to three different persons working at The White Rabbit. In every talk and every email we asked if our reservation is valid just to be sure. All three of them confirmed it. We even got the confirmation in writing. We have to add that we put the date of our wedding especially on that date because we got the confirmation form The White Rabbit and we really wanted to celebrate there.After posing some organizational questions last week we got the reply that they have another booking on our date and that they are so sorry to dismiss ours (would they ever have told me without me having me posing those last questions?). After talking to an employee and the person in charge of The White Rabbit we found out that this was an exclusive booking of the whole premises for 120 persons which were much more than the 30 persons we were looking for.The employee contradicted the person in charge about the time this exclusive booking was made. The employee told us it was made two weeks ago (so way after our booking was confirmed) and the person in charge was talking about that it dated back one year. But both agreed on finding our reservation in their system. Again, they were so sorry they told us without seeming to be honestly sorry. Otherwise they would have acted very differently. Even the person in charge did not even think of any compensation in whatever form.Of course, 120 persons are generating higher profits than 30 persons but what is it worth to have a reservation at this restaurant if you cannot rely on it? Especially if it is for such an important event as your own wedding. Is this the way a so called professional restaurant should treat their customers? I would never again book this premises for any event and hope people are now aware of how they might get treated if they do it. Thanks The White Rabbit, you made the preparation for our valuable day very special but in a terribly disappointing way
3
It was all a very pleasant experience, having per drinks outside, then being seated in a comfy booth, going through some delicious (pricey) starters... Until the management at about 9:45pm started preparing the room for Saturdays brunch, moving the entire central section, pushing chairs, bringing in foldable tables... Spoiling the so far relaxing atmosphere. So Mr Rabbit, if you intend to propose a great dinner experience, worth what we pay for, please do not put up a "building site" right in front of your guests. Definitely degrading an otherwise good rating
5
Wonderful birthday meal with friends in this beautiful old church given a modern interior. Great set lunch menu - excellent service and food.
5
- Great service, great food, great location and great ambiance!
- Reservation is recommended for the weekends
5
We were visiting from England and our daughter who now lives and works in Singapore treated us to a wonderful evening. Walking through the arch to arrive in this magical white and green garden was quite an experience. The menu selection was superb and my meal was divine. The wine choice was excellent and the service just perfect.Congratulations on the renovation of the building. The design and décor compliment the original features and is really, really beautiful
5
I brought several friends to the White Rabbit for lunch. The restaurant is located in an old church. The food is excellent and the service is good
4
The food and service were very good. The evening went very quickly. I think we were the last to leave. No complaints. The high ceilings and original features of the chapel added to the experience
4
place - awesome and rusticlocation - dempsey and so if you don't drive, prepare to walk to go to the main street for Bus or wait till kingdom come for a cabservice - waiter who took the order got the food order wrong (i think he was one of the managers?)surroundings - great! ceiling was high, we had the corner table and it was more private than the central aisle tables. Suggestion - on the elevated platform, there are 2/3 tables that had 3 seating arranged.... 1 of this table had the chair FACING the other table and that made me damn bloody uncomfy.food - good wholesome greatness. the steak was soft to the teeth, the reduction was potent! the ravioli just exploded in my mouth! amazingly, whatever we ordered were good
5
The food is top notch with service crew constantly checking up on you to ensure a good dining experience. Must visit!
5
This place has the awesome food. Had dine here for my boyfriend's birthday and my experience was good. Service was prom and attentive. About the food, they have a wide range of items on the menu, was able to try braised oxtail. It's superb!Also do try their desserts. I had the crepe suzet. And they did a live cooking in front of our table. The taste was so sweet yet the ice cream just meltd perfectly into your mouth.A must go-to place
5
I was here on Vesak day to have dinner with friends and this is my favourite place to bring friends from out of town to impress.Classic European fare at its best without the fancy infusion stuff that you find in most restaurants nowadays. Will strongly recommend the beef carpacio, ribeye, seabass, truffled chicken, foie gras and the list goes on. They also have really awesome desserts like the lava cake, baked Alaska and white choc souffle.We had drinks at their outdoor garden bar called the Rabbit Hole and had really refreshing cocktails before having our dinner indoors. Its a cool chill out area and great place to Hav get togethers and parties.Staff are very attentive and take note of every detail of what is requested. Excellent service and great ambience. I will strongly recommended this place as a place to impress and creating great memories. Kudos to the team of The White Rabbit for an excellent job. You have my vote and will be seeing me again more often. Thank you for the great experience

My first time dining at the white rabbit left me an indelible experience. I went with my family for a birthday celebration for my dad as well as a belated mother's day treat. Firstly, the ambience and atmosphere of the restaurant was amazingly comfortable. I wasn't quite please with the font size of the menu but I was elated when they took out a table lamp for us. I ordered quite a couple of items. EntréesBeef carpaccioLobster bisqueMainsSalmonSea bassTruffle chickenCrab pastaMangalica porkShort ribsSidesMushroomTruffle mashedMac and cheeseAsparagusDessertsBaked alaskaChocolate molleuxCreepsSoufflePoached pearI would like to give compliments to the chef for the exquisite cuisine and the excellent service provided by the staff. To prevent it from being too lengthy I will only comment on some dishesThe beef carpaccio was heavenly. One of the best entrée I had ever eaten. The beef was done with dressing and finish off with Truffle sauce and Truffle made this simple dish outstanding. The Truffle chicken was extremely good. The meat was cook to perfection. Even the breast meat was tender and succulent. Tagliatelle was good and the broth made the pasta nice. However it's slightly pricy and I believe is because of the crab meat. For the sides the mushroom and Truffle mashed was equally good and I love the mac & cheese. The dessert was splendid. I especially love the baked alaska, chocolate molleux and the creeps. Each desserts has its own uniqueness and specialities. Is a must try for these three desserts. The soufflé to me was a slighty too sweet and definitely in favour for those who have a sweet tooth.They have piping on the desserts if u infrom the staff that is a birthday celebration. I think it very rather creative of them to do so and gives the guest a surprise. Even though the place was remarkable there are still some feedback I would like to share. Some of the items were not avaliable. I consult the manager about it and he told me is because of the high demand for the items and sometimes those items are not readily avaliable. So he suggest that we could reserve those items in advance. Some of the portions were small but it's semi fine dining so I thought that the portion was fair.All in all I think the white rabbit is a highly recommended place for people to dine at.I just want to highlight that some positive comment and negative comments for the restaurant. I believe that each individual have different unique pallet and the white rabbit is definitely a place where I will frequent again. CheersRaygo

Its an old church converted into a restaurant. The place is so cozy. The food is great. Had the best baked alaska there, definately worth it.
5
I have visited this restaurant at least 3-4 times in total, and was not disappointed with the quality of food and service at White Rabbit. I especially love their Beef Carpaccio entree!! Their menu is also pretty interesting, offering a variety of foods most people will enjoy.Staff are friendly, polite and professional. The restaurant itself is clean, classy and has a beautiful decor, making the ambience unforgettable.I had a birthday dinner there, and it was a meal to remember. Awesome food portions that made us really full by the end of the meal... worth the price! In my opinion, this restaurant is the perfect place to celebrate special occasions.I highly recommend this restaurant
1
Made a reservation for Mothers Day the day prior (Morning). They said, sure they have space at 10.30. Sent my sms confirmation. Almost at Midnight! To be safe I sent a sms asking why was there no confirmation (didn't want to take my family there on Mother's Day and have the entire day spoilt).The person on the other side had the cheeks to say, sorry was too busy but I need to go and drop off payment (deposit) or use Pay Pal to pay them ASAP for a reservation that is 10.5 hours away!!!!!!!That's when I realized, these guys have gotten a little too much ahead of themselves. Very unfortunate as I didn't make any other reservations for the family but it is what it is. No more White Rabbit. Standard has gone down as well anyways.If you have an occasion that's important, I suggest finding a new place to eat at :)Regards,Muth

We went to the White Rabbit for an early Mothers Day lunch. Brunch items were ok - not much lobster in the lobster and cheese omelette. The big issue I had was the ridiculous size of the bread and butter pudding for desert. It was far far too big and I was quite put off even trying to eat it. I ate a reasonable portion size and left 75% of it. One of my tests of a good restaurant is if they ask why you left such a large portion of a course uneaten - at the White Rabbit, nobody seemed to care. Oh well, we have ticked that box and won't go back.

Me and wife dine at the white rabbit last night. At first we were so happy coz they seated us in a comfy seat. But all our excitement went off when the waiter started to present the menu. There's so many items in the menu that is changed and not available. Even the simple mango for the salad they dont have. We're so disappointed. What is a good service, nice ambience, and comfy seats if most of the food in their menu is not available/changed
3
The setting was lovely. We were advised when we sat down that some items on the menu were not available. The peach bellinis were delicious. The wine was over priced so we stuck with tap water for the rest of the meal. The roast chicken with truffle and mac & cheese with truffle were equally delicious. However the entrées were terrible! The Niçoise salad was awful and comprised mainly of green salad. It completely lacked other vegetables and potato. Plus there was only half an egg. It was over priced. However what was worse was the lobster bisque. At $38 a bowl you would expect it to be a lot better than it was. The bisque was overpowered by tarragon and the only lobster you could taste was when you actually ate a piece of lobster.We advised the waiter that we would have the roast chicken with truffle and the mac & cheese with truffle. The waiter suggested that we order entrées as it would take 40 minutes for the roast chicken. The chicken came to the table in about 20 minutes. Plus the entrées were terrible and over priced. The waiter was not very knowledgeable on the dishes at all. I think you could probably find a better meal elsewhere in Singapore.

i have been to white rabbit in many occasions, the food and service had never failed to impress me. Consistent food quality and immpeccable service. my friends and guests whom had been there,share the same sentiments as me.Highly recommended

I wasn't very hopeful before we entered the place because of all the mixed reviews I had read but I was pleasantly surprised . The food was excellent accompanied by equally wonderful service. I had the lamb rack which was fabulous. My partner had the melt in your mouth short ribs . We both started with the incredible lobster bisque . It's expensive but worth every spoonful of the half lobster in the sinfully rich broth ! Great place for a special occasion

This is a lovely restaurant. An atmospheric space in an old converted church provides a very interesting place in which to dine. The food was fresh, simply prepared and enjoyable and the staff were attentive and friendly. The only disappointment was that one of the signature dishes was already sold-out by 7.30pm on the night I was there. Saying that, I would highly recommend this restaurant

This is not my first time in white rabbit,but what is trully amazing to this place is they make their better service to best!!.. A modern restaurant in an old church, bar in the garden, simple dish with a unique taste and lovely staff!. Worth simply amazin

What makes this restaurant the best?
Exceptionally delicious dish + good service made by their warm and friendly staff = GREAT EXPERIENCE!

Housed in a former church, this restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere. Food is good and menu was varied.. Service could be quicker and slightly overpriced for what you get.

This is my first time dining in such a wonderful restaurant with my boyfriend last night. Both of us ordered the 4 course set menu with the wine pairing. I was amazed with all the courses especially the wagyu beef carpacchio and the seabass. The wine pairing really pairs very well with the food too. Service staffs were all very attentive and also making sure everything is going on well for the both of us. Overall it really worth the price and of course the lively attitude of the staff makes us want to come back again. Thank you

I've visited White Rabbit with my friend and we were amaze by this place. We both had their set dinner. I loved every course that I had especially the short ribs which is so tender and the crepes which they cook and fire up in front of us. And I must say having their set dinner is a great value for money.. 98++ for a delightful set dinner with great ambiance and great service. We will definitely come back!

This place looks as if it was a church or chapel with a few tables instead of pews. There was an open area at the back with some scruffy tables and chairs and the waiter, who served us (eventually) did so as a favour. Four small local draught beers, two glasses of vin very ordinaire and a bottle of water was the equivalent of Â£50. Says it all really

My husband and I decided to try The White Rabbit for our ten year anniversary celebration at Dempsey Hill. At first I thought it might be a bit formal being in an old church and we arrived early and were one of the first diners. As the restaurant filled up and we had a very efficient and helpful waitress we felt more at ease and enjoyed the ambiance. We were recommended the four course set menu but I felt this would be too much (and am not a big dessert fan) so we opted for two courses from the Ala Carte menu. The set menu contains the chefs specialties so I ordered the Salad Printemps and the 36 hours Brandt Short Ribs with a side of grilled asparagus. The bread rolls served at the start were divine and it took all my self control not to fill up before the entree was served. The Printemps Salad was fresh and delicious and contained slices of mango, avocado, asparagus and the taste of truffle which I loved. I then moved on to my main which was mouth watering and the short ribs were so tender. The flavours in my main were subtle but well balanced and I had more than enough to eat. We have now found our new favourite restaurant in Singapore and I would highly recommend this place

I went to the white rabbit for dinner last night, for 3 people. It was the best experience i ever had so far!! The staffs was very friendly and the food was very nice too.What make mine dinner perfect was the wine. Had a bottle of two paddocks pinot noir followby a bottle of huellas.Both recommend by a young guy name leslie, i believe he is the wine sommelier for white rabbit.Both bottle of wine that is recommend by leslie, really hit the spot last night. Really fulfil what i ask for and what i wanted to drink.For wines, must really visit white rabbit and look for leslie!!!! It won't go wrong!!!

Hey, can someone tell me what exactly is the reservation line for?Made a reservation for 2 at 9pm on 12th February. Arrived earlier than my reservation time and was told to wait a while for my table to be ready. 1 hour plus later and even asking about the table (was told to wait another 5 minutes), I wasn't even approached once by the service staff to inform me that there was a delay. The service was really bad. Not only didn't I get my table, i also had not received any calls to inform or ask me whether was I coming. So be it, if they're not interested then this isn't worth anyone's time. You have spoilt my entire evening, Thanks.Zero stars if I could. 1 star for the so-so mocktail I had while waiting. Count your blessings

Me and my girlfriend went here last valentine's day and the experience we had here was fabulous.The interior of this place is definitely one of a kind, so romantic. The food was exceptionally delicious and well presented. I enjoyed the spicy pasta (I forgot what they called it) and the seabass tho it's in a plastic... My girlfriend and I both loved the drinks that was given to us.. Thanks to UOB for the complimentary drinks. LOLThank you to the staff that attended our needs. Very polite and approachableThank you White Rabbit for giving us our BEST DATE EVER (so far)

 It is our first time in singapore,we are finding some place to dine and in our search the hotel concierge give us a choice of different restaurant. We decided to choice the white rabbit.as we reach the restaurant the hostess greet us with a warm smile and lead us to our table.  We found a place like a paradise,dining inside an old church with amazing interior and design.there is also a garden outside where your kids can enjoy playing and everyone will do since its an open air area with a relaxing atmosphere. The food is fantastic! For the starters we try the lobster bisque, wagyu carpaccio and foiegras,for the main Short ribs, pork collar and pasta tagliatelle and we share the baked alaska and chocolate lava cake for our dessert! Service staff are all professionals and well trained. All are accomodating and attentive with all our needs, it feels like we are just visiting friends house. Kudos to everyone it is worth visiting restaurant in singapore,we trully enjoy our dinning experience and we will be back before leaving singapore

you can't go wrong choosing this restaurant. definitely the place to crave for cote de bouef.
Very eclectic interiors with high ceilings. attentive waitress/waitresses , reasonable price.
great meals overall.

Decided to drop by the white rabbit for a dinner. Has been a long while since I was there and seems to eternity. Was greater warmly by the host and before I am seated, a few of the staff come by and wishes me "welcome back". And the manager on duty came and wishes me a "gong Xi Fatt Cai". This is really wonderful feeling especially that I have been there like 5-6 time last year.Decor look great and was seated in the middle of the restaurant which is pretty spacious without hearing the conversation from the next table. After I order my dinner, I went to the outdoor to have a look. A total change from my previous visits, a revamp and refresh new look. Dinner: great beef carpaccio- with truffles and using wagyu beef that gives you a great kick, the lobster bisque- creamy, rich and serve with half a Maine lobster, roasted whole chicken- soft and succulent, with the right crisp outside( unlike the Chinese roast chicken ). Dessert- apple tart, so good and crispy that look like a popiah. Had a wine recommended by a young gentlemen, San Filipino brunello, ripe and medium with good fruits and long finish. All in all, great service which you don't find in lots of places. Service prompt yet non intrusive

My friends and I had a wonderful last minute meetup, on a saturday evening at the white rabbit.On first impression, the host was friendly and very well presented. We were surprise that they could accomodate a table of 5 on a busy night. The table we got was at the back of the church where it was a nice cosy corner for a gathering.Staff were attentive and they were always present whenever we needed something. They were responsive and efficient. The food was excellent, and value for money. We were already stuffed by the time we finished our main course. However, one of my friend was so attracted to the crepe suzette that we prepared tableside by their staff. It was definitely an enjoyable night!We then proceeded to the rabbit hole(the outside bar) for drinks and we spent way lesser than what we have expected!This is a must try place! It is definitely romantic enough for any first dates and couple, as well as good place for gatherings

We had a bday dinner at the 'famous ' White Rabbit. However, it was such a disappointing dinner. At first, we came at d restaurant at the reservation time , but the restaurant was not ready. So we had to wait in the outdoor bar for the restaurant to get ready in the next 15 mind.Secondly, the hostess brought us to the table right in front of the washroom. When we asked to change the seat (the whole restaurant only few table were seated then, I believe it was not a big effort to make), she showed her face right in front of us n like we irritated her. As a service stuff, the last thing u shudder show to ur guest, is ur attitude.Thirdly, during d entire dinner, there was not even one management team came to ask how is the dinner... how is everything.. etc... Even though they knew that we were upset by the seats. The restaurant were not busy, and they could have make something different. Besides the deco of the restaurant really looks old n tired, the food there is good. Floor stuff did their part to ensure that any other thing fell to the worse part. They are efficient n attentative.Overall, I wont recommend the place to any one coz there are definitely more welcoming restaurants out there

White Rabbit was a lucky find indeed. I wanted a special place to go with my family for brunch and found this interesting name while web-searching. White Rabbit proved to be a wonderful place to dine - great service, delicious food, excellent presentation, beautiful surroundings ...a truly satisfying and happy experience

We were very fortunate to be asked back to The White Rabbit to experience how well it had progressed and how it had changed for the better since our last visit a couple of years ago.Both myself and my vegetarian partner were very impressed with the service levels, range of food options and vegetarian options along with the ever growing wine list which is always a bonus in Singapore.We were both delighted to have our expectations exceeded in the nicest possible way and very much enjoyed our dinner it was remains one of the most unique restaurant venues in Singapore.They focus on quality rather than quantity in the menu and that really shines through with all my courses from oysters to delicious crab taglitelle to seabass to some very tasty desserts and some great cheeses all making a very positive impression and being lapped up.Thanks for having us back and keep on adding extra tasty and interesting things to eat and drink to keep your standards high

My first trip to The White Rabbit was overwhelmingly disappointing but I am glad to say that on my return I have found things much improved. The service was exceptional everything from the champagne on ice at our arrival was positively sublime. The wonderful service was swiftly accompagnied by some wonderful tomato and basil ciabatta some of the tastiest bread I've had in Singapore. As a vegetarian the dishes all ranked highly in terms of quality of ingredients, size of portion and presentation, although there is still some work to do on flavours and cooking techniques but then I am an exceptionally tough customer. The Salade Printemps was an interesting combination of flavours and I liked that it was not overwhelmed by dressing. The Burrata cheese was also delicious but the portion was way too big for 1 and the quantity and flavour of the tomatoes did not balance with the cheese. The Mushroom Ravioli had delicious wafer thin pasta and a dish that could be overwhelming and heavy was light and refreshing, although the filling of the Ravioli could be improved but this is just a simple technique issue, the parmesan foam is a pointless extravagance and high quality parmesan shavings would be much more effective. The grilled asparagus was fantastic but the French fries were disappointing. My meat eating friend had excellent Oysters and a very good sea bass en papillote he also had the crab pasta which he rated as a highlight. For me the real highlight of the meal was the wine list. a.)It is incredibly reasonably priced b.)It is one of the more interesting lists in Singapore with lots of wines that I have not seen elsewhere that offers exceptional value for the quality. We had a Drouhin Chardonnay from Oregon (where else in Singapore can you get that?) recommended by the very helpful and unpretentious Sommelier. The desserts are also notable the Crepe Suzette are sublime and come with a lot of drama that adds to the occasion the baked Alaska also looked good. Overall a great dining experience and we will be going back Thank you to all the staff who made tonight a great evening

Seeing pictures of the restaurant in magazines, i've been wanting to try this place for years and manage to grab a chance to do so. Tried booking online for a 7 or 730pm but only 630pm was available. As luck would have it, work really kept piling up and there was no way i could make 630pm and i called them instead. They accommodated a 730pm, which was nice of themParking at peak hours on friday night is a very frustrating affair here. Very limited parking for about 20 cars, for a restaurant that seats about 150. So be warnedUpon entering, it is indeed a pleasant novelty as the high ceiling and stained glass adds to the ambience. However, after a while, your realise the high ceiling ricochets everyone's chatter and it is quite the din. Definitely not the place to have a business discussion or a quiet dinnerIt was already late and we decided to go straight to mains. Ordered the truffle roast chicken for 2, which sounded delicious. Alas, they said it was going to take 40mins! Decided to order other mains instead. My friend ordered the ribeye while i asked for the seabass. My fish came cooked in a plastic bag which they cut open. It was good tasting, but had 4 bones in it! I've watched enough episodes of masterchef and topchef to know that they jolly well remove the pinbones with kitchen tweezers while prepping! And my friend's medium steak turned out to be medium rare. And of course, they don't have staff asking you how the food was, unless many 5 star establishmentsDessert seemed reasonably priced and we decided on another go. My friend's baked alaska seemed ok enough .My lava cake didn't have enough lava in i

A novel setting, perfect for our Christmas dinner. The staff were attentive & helpful. The food was excellent, we eat mainly fish & both the cod & Dover Sole were excellent. My son had the short ribs whch melted in the mouth. The wine list seems a bit out of date, they didn't have our first choice & the second was a 2013 rather than 2011 as advertised but it was fine. We did notice that despite asking for house water as the locals were drinking we were served Evian which does irritate me but not enough to change my overall rating. We finished the evening in the garden which was very relaxing. The best coffee i have had out here! Compared to the wide variety of other Singapore places we have eaten in it is pricey but worth it for a treat
5
One of the most romantic place to dine in Singapore. The ambiance was perfect for lovers like us. The food was excellent, very flavorful.. And the staff were attentive and friendly..We really enjoyed the whole dining experience. Thank you White Rabbit for giving us an unforgettable anniversary celebration.MUST TRY: Lobster Bisque Soup, Foie Gras, Seabass, and of course their Crepe Suzette
1
Service - lousy.. cant even remember the orders ... food was not fresh. Atlantic cod was fishy. Service was slow. Pasta was cold. Server was a bit rude. Air was stuffy
2
The building is definitely special, but that's about where it stops. I do really not understand the high rating of this restaurant on tripadvisor.We went here for a quick Sunday evening dinner, but were rather disappointed:We started with a vegetable soup, which was ok for a very simple soup, but definitely not worth the 14 dollar it is priced for on the menu.My main course was the ribeye, which was medium instead of the ordered medium-rare.My table partner had the pork filet.The meat was of an OK quality. However, especially for the ribeye the rest of the plate was poor (mainly a rocket salad).The dish was very salty and pretty fat. It didn't feel too friendly for the stomach on the way back.The ribeye was prepared as medium, though medium-rare was ordered.  Service was so so at best.The restaurant is located in a very calm surrounding, so you would need a taxi or own car in order to get there.In total we paid around 100 Singapore dollar per person for a starter, main course and 2 drinks each, which results in a very poor price/quality compared to some other restaurants in Singapore in the same price range
5
We ate here over the weekend and everything about it was great. The food was absolutely outstanding - we both had the four-course tasting menu and each course was great. The service couldn't have been friendlier or more attentive and the building itself is beautiful both on the inside and out.This is one of the best meals I've had in Singapore - I'll definitely be back
5
We were told one of the must-do things in Singapore was dinner at the White Rabbit. It was good advice. It's located in the former garrison chapel of a British Army base, and has a lovely atmosphere. We chose to have the set menu, and were not disappointed. What made the meal was our decision to pay a bit more to have the wines specially chosen for each course. The general manager stopped by our table, and before you knew it, he was giving us tastes of other wines he is contemplating adding to the wine list. So it ended up as and excellent meal complimented by an excellent wine tasting experience. After dinner, a visit to the bar out back where a large group of Singapore's young professional expat community were having a rollicking evening
3
When entering the restaurant we thought this would be a marvellous evening, because you rarely see such a venue. An old church that's converted to a really cool restaurant. It started well, and kind of went downhill from there. Food was actually ok (dessert was more than ok, the chocolate fondant with passion fruit icecream was excellent!), but service was really unattentive. We nearly had walk over to fetch the waiters after trying to get their attention. When you pay 350 SG$ for two you'd expect more. All in all, great location, ok food, really show service and high prices!
3
Some people just here for the ambience and design, a restaurant in a church is a cool...trouble is the food, service and ambience don't match the promise.They try hard but just keep missing the target. The food is ok and overpriced, the service is ok but inexperienced and the ambience is not especially romantic but ok with friends. Nice idea, just poorly executed, not bad but for these prices you expect a whole lot more
5
We came upon this place by chance when a google search brought up a top 10 of unique things to do in Singapore. We were not disappointed. A taxi from Novena only cost $12. The building was simply stunning (a converted Garrison church within an old 1950s British army base) We had pre dinner drinks in the pretty back garden area, known as the rabbit hole. Very 'Alice in Wonderland' The restaurant itself was very impressive - charming with beautiful stained glass windows and a great ambience. Service was impeccable and the food was amazing. This place is pretty expensive - we paid $251 for 2 courses, 2 glasses of champagne and 2 cocktails however it was a thoroughly enjoyable evening and worth every penny!

Came here for my Birthday Dinner with Family.Was a beautiful venue! Open and spacious, and that stunning stained glass! Staff were very welcoming and attentive. We first started off in the back garden for drinks, very relaxing with soft music playing. And later moved inside for dinner. The food was good and I had a lovely surprise dessert at the end of our meal, Was perfect for my birthday

We visited for a Saturday lunch. In a nice quiet neighborhood, the space is simply decorated maintaining a relaxing and airy feeling. A nice space to spend an afternoon.The food was nicely done. The specialty dishes (such as the ox tail) really shined, though some of the others looked to suffered a little from lack of attention. The raspberry french toast could not be made without raspberry because the server told us it was pre-made. It came with burnt caramel too. Everything was overpriced....but this is Singapore and that seems to be how things are done.The big thing holding back the enjoyment of our meal was the burning incident. We were dining with our 4 yr old son and order mac.n.cheee off the KIDS menu. While I was distracted by the third server trying to warn me that my plate might be hot another server drops a cast-iron skillet of mac'n'cheese straight from the oven with the handle sticking right at our child. Being a 4yr old, he reached for it and before I knew it he burned his finger. The skillet was hot enough to melt the plastic tableware they insisted that he have, even though he can use a real fork. Who puts an iron skillet on a kid's menu? And who throws a hot skillet at a kid?The inattentive staff continued with the status quo with a couple of token ice cubes delivered to the table somehow intended to solve everything.As for the food the only true disaster of the meal was the coffee. Boasting a "special" selection of beans and fancy Italian machinery...the $8 cup should be held as an embarrassment to the operator. It tasted old and flat even though I watched it brew. Again, seemingly a trend
5
The recent renovation ve given this place a fresh new look. Food and service still great. Good selections for lunch and very well price for their set lunch. Order beef carpaccio which is out of the world, the favors of truffle lingers on with each mouthful. The beef cheek braised till tender and almost melt in your mouth. Service wise, very attentive yet not intrusive. Staff are knowledgeable and friendly. I will definitely come back again for lunch.
5
Decor was beautiful. Staff pleasant, service great. Food was amazing. My husband and myself caught a taxi from orchard rd, about a 10min drive, have the address handy, as the taxi driver didn't know of it.
5
This place is lovely from the decor, the food, the service to the exterior terrace. Although, it is not cheap (98 singapore dollars for a 4 course dinner not including drinks) I would recommend anybody who can afford it to go and enjoy the place!
3
Interesting building and a nice place to eatFood was nice - not amazing but good. A bit expensive for what it isStaff seem a bit up themselves. When arrived, asked to sit in a boot and apparently "all reserved" - many remained free throughout the whole of lunch. I think they saw us as tourists and not worth looking after.Drank iced water throughout meal. Kept having to ask for more and felt we were an imposition, where if we were drinking paid for drinks they would have been a lot more helpfu
5
My wife,daughter and son in law went to the White Rabbit(unfortunately I was unwell and sorely disappointed as I had been so looking forward to going).However,there was no disappointment for the three who went. Menu choice terrific leaving final choices difficult to come to.Food cooked to perfection with excellent and professional service and superb choice of wines and cocktails.Again my daughter's recommendation was proved correct.My wife found it a great dining experience thus deepening my frustration!! Singapore is blessed with some great restaurants and this is definitely in the top ten or so!
5
Singapore is said to be the shopping paradise and then the White Rabbit is believed personally food paradise.It is an old church so you will have a feeling of charming and ancient.As I was amazed by varieties of the food list on the menu, I decided to choose randomly lobster and claw. I was not disappointed. So excited.You may find the price quiet high but it is worthy compared to the quality of food, luxurious decoration and efficient and charming service. It is really an amazing value.Wanna feel like in paradise, just come the White Rabbit
5
This is a something special - not only the building and surrounds, but the food. The entrees especially were exquisite with beautiful flavors and presentation. The signature Pork collar was very tasteful , although if you don;t like the fatty aspect - this may not be to your liking...however i enjoyed the combination of ingredients . Also , very good size portions
4
I have visited Singapore often and was getting a little tired of the same seafood restaurants. I read about The White Rabbit in a travel article on Singapore and wanted to try it. It's in an old Church which is a beautfiul venue. The menu was varied and I chose a wonderful salad with avocado, mango and then had mushroom ravioli which was very nice
4
I think one of my favourite aspects of The White Rabbit is the charming ambience. Located in an old church in Dempsey precinct, there's something very unusual and lovely about it. Interior is decorated with restraint and style; almost a Scandinavian seventies feel. There are many booths to choose from, and a comfortable lounge area near the bar indoors. Outdoors is a further bar area in the garden. We often bring visitors from overseas here for dinner. Staff are nice, helpful, and experienced. The food is British, well-executed, reliable. It's never disappointed, and the serving portions are just the right size. A good wine list complements the menu. The White Rabbit also offers brunch and I look forward to trying that some time soon too
5
An epicurean experience... Exquisite flavours! I booked a couple of weeks before our visit, on the night we were delayed getting to the restaurant but phoned ahead and they were really accommodating.The four course menu at 98 SD, with wine pairings at 58 SD was amazing value, Wagyu Carpacio was truly splendid, as was the beef cheek bourguignon.Did I mention the gorgeous bread.... The helpful staff...the ambienceDo yourself a favour....don't miss it
5
Just had a marvelous dinner here last week. I suggest reservations, because they were quite busy. I ordered their set menu with wine pairings. My choices were the salad Printemps (lovely mango and avocado flavors) beef carpaccio ( perfectly sliced with mushroom and parmesan), beef bourguignon ( so tender and yummy) and grand marnier crepe suzette (delightful). The food and service were excellent! I thoroughly enjoyed my meal experience. One friend ordered a la carte and enjoyed her meal thoroughly especially the chocolate souffle
5
Food is amazing and service top notch.
It is one of the best, if not the best, restaurant in Dempsey!
Must try: Lobster bisque, pork collar
4
Location and interior is amazing. Very good food and service. Really worth visiting, one of the better restaurants in Dempsey.
3
The fact that the place used to be a chapel makes this restaurant in my bucket list. I find it very relaxing to dine in while the light comes through the stained glass. i love that It's spacious and you can enjoy the view of family, couple or friends enjoying a group lunch, the location is quiet too so you can have all the privacy. Though I was expecting a very nice meal but it turns out to be just average, the lamb is a under cook and the potato salad is just usual. They have an extensive wine list though and the staff are all smiling and courteous.
5
Not one of the cheapest places to eat. But if you want a flavourful lobster bisque that comes with half side of lobster and claw, this is the restaurant to come to. So, I reckoned that SGD 38 is not overpriced honestly. The other dishes are good too. Overall, I had a nice dining experience and would definitely recommend to my friends
5
Being a long while since I last decided to come for dinner. Remember was weeks ago but seems like ages.This time round did make my reservations. I was late but was greeted by the sweet lady at the door. She was friendly and remember me for my last visits. Was promptly seated at the table. A few familiar staff comes by my table and welcome me back. This is one treatment you for sure wouldn't get anywhere else. I ordered their set menu whole my wife decided on the lobster bisque and Dover sole. Must admit the chef took great pride in his cooking and quality of food are great for the prices charge. Their set menu was of great quality. Plus wine pairing of $55. Interesting wine selections which is pretty rare to come by. I have the NiÃ§oise salad( favorsome with fresh anchovies), foie gras( melts in your mouth), the crab meat pasta (amazing- the best pasta, done al dente and flavorful), crepe Suzette (done table side and very well done), the Dover sole ( beautifully cook). Overall an excellent meal and very well price.
3
Treated our helper yesterday as it was her birthday. Fancy prices, but food quality was not so fancy. The lobster bisque is salty, the cod fish is salty, the mashed potato, although served in a nice fancy dish, was gluey. Beef cheek bourguignon was not bad though. The baked Alaskan (ice cream cake) tasted bleh. Price excluding any wine came p to sgd 110 per pax. Not exorbitant but for this price, I could get better food elsewhere. Would give this a miss next time
5
Read a lot about this place before we finally managed to go and it was everything we expected and more. Its a very cool and rustic place , staff , food , drinks and atmosphere was a pleasure a must go place for dinner , round two will be soon for Sunday brunch , keep up the good work ladies and gents a credit to all your staff
4
food was delish especially the fish which was what they recommended. the dessert was ridiculously yummy as well. the mocktail though for me was eh, just another drink and I've had much better/creative mocktail drinks. what I loved about this place was the atmosphere with a big open space, rustic feeling which is RARE in Singapore. the place was also quite romantic (we went on a friday night). it was also really cute that a couple sitting next to us (clearly a date), when one got up to the go to the bathroom I presume the other took out his phone to take a picture of the restaurant (it is a very cool place aesthetically/architecturally). I plan to go there again and definitely take my friends/relatives when they visit Singapore
3
This restaurant has a nice atmosphere and is well patronized. Service was found to be tardy but other reviews say it is great so maybe we just experienced an off night. Salad Pritemps was mainly lettuce and not much flavor, the expensive lobster bisque was salty and the lobster was tough, not for great eating at $38 a bowl! Sea bream was quite lovely and had depth of flavor and was a good choice. Wine is outrageous and there is no good reason why prices should be set as high as they are.Overall it was ok but we would give other establishments in Dempsey a second round before coming back here.
5
...service, quality and art of food presentation, restaurant deco (former Church), all definitely top notch and increasingly hard to find in Singapore. Second visit (Dinner) confirmed impression of earlier visit for Lunch. Very friendly and professional staff, in fact excellent! Highly but not overpowering attentive. They all performed like being trained at a leading Hotel Management school! Selection of Food could offer a bit more variety, the wine list has not enough reasonably priced wines on offer. We will be back
2
Expect gloomy looking foreign service staff, communicating mainly in native language amongst themselves. Dishes uses mainly substandard ingredient. Freshness questionable.
5
Love this place - it is different and special. The food is wonderful but a little pricey and also service might not always be so quick. Be sure to book ahead as a lot of the restaurants in Dempsey fill up very quickly.

In a refurbished chapel this place made for a delightful location for brunch. The quiche was incredibly creamy and the crepe Suzette made table side was extraordinary. I would definitely recommend a meal here.

Have visited the white rabbit twice and not yet to be disappointed. Service was attentive, the steak was delicious and lovely wine. Nice setting outside for pre and post dinner drinks.

We recently celebrated a friend's birthday here and the venue was great. Service was great (very attentive) and atmosphere was really unique. The space is lovely and the food is really good. Well worth visiting. The desserts on the set lunch menu were excellent.

We were only briefly in Singapore for my husband's 40th birthday. The White Rabbit was recommended, and so we tried the 4 course Prix Fixe.Wow. Just, wow.Amazing staff - couldn't be more friendly and helpful.Great atmosphere - so much work has gone into maintaining as much of the original British army chapel fittings, flooring etc. It's really lovely.The food....don't even get me started! The Foie Gras done 2 ways was amazing. Hubby was prepared to divorce me to marry the chef who produced the beef cheek bourgignon. We fought over dessert choices. The food really is first rate.We don't go to "fine dining" establishments often. This was a special occasion and the staff really went that extra mile to ensure it was special for us - the crepes suzette made at the table, complete with chocolate Happy Birthday message and candle

Decided to come for brunch and pleasantly surprise that the host recognized me from my previous visit and again with not prior reservation. Service is great and we got quite a fair bit of attention even though is pretty busy and am glad that I come today as they ve a new brunch menu with oxtail and rosti potato which is heavenly. Can't really think if any where else that serve oxtail. Overall excellent meal! Attentive and knowledgeable staff that took care of my table. Many thanks guys!

Pretty much the building is the only good part about this restaurant. The service was good, but the menu is over priced for the quality. The wine list has an incredible mark-up too. Using a coupon helped us out a bit, but it was not a dinner that we would recommend
4
A spacious renovated church is home for a restaurant that is well worth a visit.The service rates among the best ive experienced in Singapore, the menu good but limited.Quality is high with prices to match. Would I go back, maybe but I would consider alternatives before I wen

The last time I dined at The White Rabbit was several years ago and as I recall it was a non-event.Dined at The White Rabbit again a few days ago, and this time it was terrible. The ambience is its one saving grace.Started off having a cocktail at the rear of the restaurant, it was "blah". We then proceeded into the main dining hall for our meal. My salad was acceptable, but my beef was terrible. My piece was full of tendons that I just gave up.Will not be back

Good staff , really good brunch in a very nice setting. Not cheap , but you know what you are getting!
4
Restaurant is located in a very creative setting- former church in old British barracks in the super hot Dempsey area.
The food is good, the service is great and the prices are very reasonable in general.
I'll be back for brunch!
5
Food is delicious and well presented. Interior is not as impressive as I expected, but there is a lovely cosy garden outside - great for drinks after dinner.
Wagyu capraccio is spectacular.
4
Wonderful service,tasty food and beautifully presented food. Pricy Decor a bit shabby. The pictures on the internet look better than the reality. Would go again for lunch, but probably not dinner.
5
my recomended to this place for dinner ,it was a wonderful evening we had there, great food and wines , we realy enjoyed it ,we appreciate the service too, sure to visit again ,

Great ambiance here to have dinner. Acoustics inside are like in a church. Quality of food and wines is terrific.
Lovely garden outside, that is great for a drink after dinner.

Went for brunch after hearing from friends. Great venue and set up with friendly and helpful staff. Order quarter pounder and egg Benedict which was delicious and nicely done. Came back last week to try their regular menu for dinner. Place was pack yet we got the attention of the staff that recognize me from previous visit. He recommended that I try their signature cocktail Black Forest mojito ( freshing and beautifully made), order beef carpaccio which was nicely season with abundant of truffles. So favorsome and wholesome! Lobster bisque- another clear winner with half a Maine lobster. Tasted the magalica pork which was juicy and serve with a beautiful sauce ( I don't remember). Overall an excellence meal and kudo to the chef! I can't really find any comparison of this resturant to any other places as the cusine a are unique on its own style. Quality of product is there! Being a foodie! My salute to the team! Will definately be back again to try their truffle chicken.
5
Great meal! Great service! Kudo to the chef and team! Ordered the lobster bisque and wagyu beef carpaccio and beef cheek as recommended by the staff, the food was delivered to our table by jonzen, the way he descript the food is so professional and make me More hungry. I ask for recommendation for dessert and recommended that I must try the soufflÃ© ! Bravo chef! Wonderful service and wine selections. Was told they just started their new wine list. And has a lot of great wine and well price.

My partner & I ate at The White Rabbit for the first time recently after hearing very good things about it. We arrived for 8pm and were shown directly to our table and given menus and the wine list. A good selection of food so it took us a little while to select. It took the waiting staff a while longer to take our order. They brought ice water, rolls & butter but didn't take our order. However when they did, the staff were very polite & professional. Our first two choices for wine were out of stock as there was a large table in & they had drunk it all! Maybe when that booking was made they should have taken wine stock into consideration? Not too drastic though. Our starters arrived together but my partners main & dessert arrived a good 5 mins before mine, so he had no choice but to start. Apparently this is normal in Singapore, but I've not experienced it in any other slightly higher end restaurants here. One we had finished it took a while to get our bill also. The interior is nice & remains obviously a converted chapel which has some good character. However it also has the acoustics of a church so was really quite noisy even though it wasn't full. It's one big open space so...pros & cons there. Overall a nice evening out, tasty food & good portion size. Not somewhere for a quiet romantic night out though. I would go back if invited but wouldn't rush back ahead of other places.

Having been a tad disappointed with the quality of several restaurants in Singapore, the White Rabbit, came as a pleasant surprise. The setting was nice, service was polite and attentive and the food was of a good to very good standard. We had 2 courses and a few bottles of good wine. Total cost about $250 per couple, which was pretty good considering the quality of food and drink. Yes, I would recommend this restaurant for couples, friends and business dinners.
4
Unique former church venue - food was fairly decent, nice outdoor bar area. We would come here again.
4
I think it is set in an old church which is a stunning setting! Plenty of room between tables so it is quiet and private. Beautiful fine food. Very very hard to get a cab back into town.

I am a regular visitor of Singapore; for Sunday brunch I used to go to Jones the Grocer and P.S. Café. However I noticed that Jones had received a quite a few negative reviews lately so this time I wanted to try something new. The White Rabbit is about SGD10 cab ride from Orchard Road. It does not look like much from the outside but the inside is beautifully renovated from an old church. I suggest a table in main dining hall where there’re high church ceilings and stained-glass windows on both sides. Our reservation was at 12 noon so there weren’t many other patrons; by about 1pm the tables are mostly filled and the place is bustling with chatter. There are a number of very comfortable looking sofa “booths” but unfortunately there were only 2 of us and we got a normal 2 person face-to-face table fairly close to other couples on both sides.I quite liked that you could reserve a table online where you are told instantly whether you are successful or not. Email confirmations and reminders are also sent to you.Food wise, I was a little disappointed by the limited choices on the menu. It is the exact opposite of Wild Honey where I had difficulty making a choice as everything looked so good. (FYI, the menu can be found on the website). The “Eggs fry-up” is basically a typical all-day-breakfast. I liked the scrambled eggs which were runny and scrambled with plenty of cream but did not like the “thick-cut bacon” which still had lots of pig hair on it. The other things (tomato, chicken sausages, bread etc) were so so.My husband had the wagyu burger which is served with salad and chips. For a burger over SGD30 and a “quarter pounder” patty I was surprised that they didn’t ask how well we’d like the beef cooked. Nonetheless it was an above-average burger (better than eggs fry-up)Overall I’m glad that I visited, I would recommend it to others but it is not that special. The quality is good but does not justify the prices. It would be a great hangout place for locals to catch up, especially those with cars and kids, but perhaps not worth it for tourists to deliberately cab here

“Lovely, romantic setting. Generous servings, delicious food.”The restaurant was completely gorgeous. Set in an old church, with candle light and diffused lamps. The food I ordered was a Beef Cheek Bourguignon very tender and full of flavour, cocktail was a Brandy Crusta very niceI will definitely be going there again

The restaurant was completely gorgeous. Set in an old church, with candle light and diffused lamps. The outside area, The Rabbit Hole, where we went to have a drink prior to our meal needs some love, though. It has faded and stained cushions and tacky rope lighting around the bar. It has the potential to be SO much more, especially if they're going for a shabby chic kind of look. The look there now is just shabby. Ordered a gin and tonic and was pleased with the serving size. We had a marvelous table in the restaurant- in the corner overlooking the dining room. The tables for 2 along the center are CLOSE to one another. Avoid those if you can, you may want to specifically request one of the sumptuous round tufted booths....they looked quite cozy. We ordered off of the menu, but the digustation option was a good value, too. Hubs got the barossa cheese entree with the micro basil and tomato (could have used more of both) and it was hands down, the BEST barossa I've ever had. Texture, temperature, taste...all three were divine. I had the carpaccio, which was good, but had (it it's possible?) too much truffle. The mains were lovely, and the desert of creme brulee was again- wonderful. A suggestion? Offer more wines by the glass. The whites were too similar to be a good selection, mostly unwooded / citrusy. We felt overall that this restaurant was a good value for the money, and that it delivered on its reputation of serving delicious food. Oh, and P.S.- the bread, which I skip 99% of the time, is NOT to be missed. They do these little tomato basil rolls that melt in your mouth. And, 3 cheers for salted butter
5
Great meal! Great service! Kudo to the chef and team! Ordered the crab cocktail and wagyu beef carpaccio and cote du boeuf as recommended by the staff, the food was delivered to our table by jonzen, the way he descript the food is so professional and make me hungrier. The beef is cook to perfection worth the wait as I was told would take at least 45 minutes and the truffle sauce is so nicely done. I ask for recommendation for dessert and recommended that I must try the soufflé ! Bravo chef!

I enjoyed the White Rabbit Experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone intending to travelling to Singapore. What I loved the most about it was its history of being the Garrison Church for the British Military on the famous Dempsey area. A great dining experience and they know their wines
5
I love this restaurant - it is in an old church at Dempsey. There is parking available. The menu is small which makes for a nice change and the service and quality and presentation of food is fantastic. Great for kids for brunch and lovely for dinner.
5
The atmosfer is really great.. They change from what used to be a church into a fine dining restaurant...First came into the door.. U will felt the warm of the greeter.. The service is really great, the waitre and the usher will explain to you spesification of the menu..their product knowledge is good..The food is amazing.. From starter until desert.. You must try the foei graas duet, the pidgeon, and the Lamb.. Really amazing..The foei graas taste fresh combining with cherry stirr fry with wine...The Lamb is very well cook..not too well not too raw, perfect cooking...The pidgeon taste wonderfull, they can make the meat so soft and with sweet mayonaise make it more wonderfull..Its wonderfull Place that make me want to come again..again..and again.... :

Was just there over the weekend with my family, decided to explore Dempsey and came accross this beautiful white building which bruings back loads of memory (used to play soccer in the field just behind). Great venue with sizeable parking space.They offers great brunch selections which you order from the menu. This place was pack and the staff are really coping and providing great service, my server Gerby and Leslie, was friendly and upon striking a conversation with them, they told me that weekend s usually pack with walk-in and family. They were accomdating and in our service and assured us that the food is to be serve soon as they are running with full house and that Chef is also working on a new menu at the same time, they showed me both ther business lunch and a-la-carte menu which offers different selections, unbelieveable selections throughtout the week and for brunch is generally cheaper than most other places which would cost more and buffet style, in general this is great value and great place to chill out, plus the kids can run around at The Rabbit Hole. The wines are relatively cheap and for $80 for a bottle of sparkling wines, could chill out at the garden area and spend my weekend. Some rare wines at below $90. Can't think of a better place for a weekend to laze and wake up late and at the same time enjoy pasta, and cote de boeuf (which was cooked beautifully), was told their chef slow cooked first before grilling them, is sure worth the wait, succulent, tender and nicely done (not recommended for those that are used to wanting fast food and having your steak grilled or pan fried, waited 40 minutes and cook with Loving tender care), this chef is one of the few chef that slow cooked their beef before grilling them and such effect is wrth the wait and quality are excellent. Looing at the team working, it is far smaller then those other places. During my whole durations, Gerby did took great care of us and my kids. Not forgeting Eva, she was accomdating even though we have no booking and she did manage to get us a table.Dessert selections was great with crepe suzette, and must say is done table side and I have not had that for years now. Will be back soon to try their dinner soon, expect the unexpected as the staff are really accomdating and note that this is not a venue if you are in a hurry. Do take some time to enjoy the environment, kudo to the team there!!!

Staff are helpful and friendly of arranging birthday surprises. There is even a nice free desert for the birthday person.

Been there more than once but on both occasions, wasn't really impressed with the food. But we love the decor and appreciate the service.

September 2012The White Rabbit is housed in an old church in the hip Dempsey area of central Singapore. As central as it can be, one still needs private transport to get here. Without prior arrangement, getting out of the complex may require quite a walk, a rather suitable supplement after a sumptuous meal in the area.I did a quick research on reviews of this place and I cannot agree more that the waiters and waitresses here tend to hide in their rabbit holes. Getting their attention require much needed effort, which can be uneasing especially when you are on a date. It is a waste considering this establishment has such a great open-area plan.The atmosphere however was great. An old church decorated with a simple sequence of wood panels which add much needed modern touch, its high ceiling and wide hall concept made a perfect setting for a lazy Sunday brunch. If one prefers to soak oneself under the equatorial sun, the outdoor seating provides atmosphere that is as great. The food were just as expected, we had egg benedicts, followed by seafood linguine marinara accompanied by glass of sauvignon blanc, topped off with crepes suzette for dessert, all of which we truly enjoyed.In all, the experience was enjoyable, in fact it reminds me of the many great weekend brunches I have had in Melbourne Australia. The price is somewhat high by Singapore standard but still considerably reasonable considering the good experience one shall have here. The service team obviously have room for improvement to make patrons' experiences complete
5
Ate here with friends celebrating a 30th birthday. Excellent location, nice and quiet with a lovely bar out the back where we had a drink before our meal. We all had steaks cooked to our preference. Mines was blue and melted in my mouth. I passed on desert but my partner had crepe suzette which was made at the table and so delicately put together with the correct balance of alcohol. A great night, expensive but worth every penny.
3
The atmosphere and decor inside this converted church restaurant suggested we were going to enjoy our experience... however the food is nothing special/unique given the hefty price tag - three mains, 2 sides and 2 glasses of wine for ~SNG200. The most disappointing aspect was that we ordered pasta for our nut-intolerant daughter. The dish was served with pine nuts despite no mention of nuts on the menu. The waiter offered to replace the dish however as all other meals were served, we had to swap dishes so we could eat at the same time. The sea bass and pork ribs were ok, nothing special given the price points. Better value for money elsewhere
5
My mom and I stopped by here before visitng the botanical garden (which is just a short walk away!) and we were delighted with this little gem. The restaurant is an old church, and brunch was fabulous in the spacious, well-lit and beautifully decorated room. I'm disappointed to see other reviewers thought the service was sub-par, we thought is was wonderful! The crepes suzettes we ordered were prepared by a smiling waiter, who also gave us wonderful recommendations on drinks and other menu favorites. Everything is pretty expensive, but the food was delicious and we got a couple lovely pictures of us brunching with the stained-glass windows in the background
2
Despite a previous bad experience we decided to give the place another try out. Same problems arose. The food is 'ok' but the service is diabolical. After ordering wine, the staff required us to ask a further twice for them to bring it to the table, the whole thing took about 20 minutes. There was then another 5 minute delay as the vintage on the list did not match the bottle. Another random bottle was then brought to the table which caused further confusion.Despite a table full of empty glasses, you constantly have to ask staff to repour wine despite 3-4 staff being within a few yards, the restaurant was not especially busy. The entire dinner took so long that when we tried to go for a drink at their much vaunted bar afterwards we were informed that they were 'closed', the wait staff obviously had offered us no warning that this might be the case.The White Rabbit is unfortunately what is wrong with so much of the Dempsey area in that it is all style and no substance and come bill time you realise you could have gone somewhere a whole lot better for the same money, we won't be going back
5
The atmosphere of this converted wooden church provides a special dining experience. The cocktails are a great start to a memorable however expensive dinner. The favorite is the dessert which is a milky way souffle. This is a very special place for a special occassion so when that moment arrives it is a short taxi ride from the city
4
Definitely in two minds about this place, because the food wasdelightful, but service distinctly spotty -- staff have a tendency todisappear into their rabbit holes for inordinately long periods, if mydinner experience last Sunday was anything to go by.Housed in an apparently deconsecrated church, the restaurant has afine shabby chic ambience accentuated by its stained glass windows,Latin ironwork phrases ('Ego Te Baptizo') over the doors anddefinitely one of the highest roofs you will find in Singapore!Fellow diners were mostly youthful couples having a romantic eveningor celebrating a special event, although there were one or two olderBoys Night Out (albeit very quiet) groups.We kicked off with a lobster bisque -- very flavourful, if a tad salty--the Camembert parcel and the shallot tarte tatin, in which theshallots were delightfully caramelised.Since it was a celebratory evening for my mother, whose birthday comesup this week, we thought a bottle of wine might be nice. The Le Volte,a third-tier Ornelleia we chose off the menu, was unavailable, so wewent instead with a Toricella, a pleasant white fellow Tuscan withdistinctly less heft but a lot less marked up than the red that hadbeen our original choice.I had the added bonus that it went well with the tapenade-crusted codI chose, though the one diner who ate meat made no complaint. Thesalmon roulade was succulent and the tournedos Rossini were done to aturn.The conversation flowed nicely, as did the bread and butter, but justbefore the dessert course the staff came up and removed the wineglasses -- without checking the contents of the wine-bucket. It turnedout there was a quarter bottle left, so we simply called for freshglassware, but still, it was a bit of a jolt in what had been a verypleasant evening until then.For dessert, two of us shared a cheese platter and the third had thechocolate fondant. The restaurant made a good effort with the cheeses,which included cheddar, Brie and a very young, slightly grainy fetathat was possibly unconventional but quite enjoyable. The chocolateemerged from the fondant in a charming burst of intense flavour.Contrary to my experience with most Singapore restaurants, which areonly too happy to take money off you, we found ourselves waiting --and waiting -- and waiting -- for the staff to return with the creditcard charge slip. I think it was fully 25 minutes before we were ableto catch the attention of our server, who was busy with a flashy crepepreparation at another table, allowed to complete the transaction andbe on our way. Our taxi-driver was kind enough to wait ungrumblinglyfor us, so it eventually mattered little

Great brunch if your view of brunch is NOT the Asian one (i.e. buffet/all-you-eat lunch) - good mix of breakfast dishes and lunch dishes. Quite true to original recipes in what they cook so I can imagine the Chilli-slaves find this 'bland' - that said I can also see that the dishes do lack a little 'soul'. Service was great (Ian's a star!) and they let my partner mix and match a little across dishes which is more than most Singapore places will do for you.Eggs B was very nice, crisp fresh toasted muffin, flavousome ham and eggs cooked to perfection. The Hollandaise was perhaps a little plain - needed a touch more lemon and/or cayenne, but great consistency and not overly 'fatty' in the mouth feel.Atmosphere very good - music?We'll be back again
4
Decent steak dinner - good food. Wait staff need honing up though.
4
We enjoyed the menu (heavy on foie gras) with interesting preparations. Service levels were better than we experienced at other restaurants in Singapore. It's a short menu with nice preparations.
3
Worth a visit if you live in Singapore for the great setting and pleasant experience. Food was just ok, fish a little dry and meals didn't quite gel together perfectly.
2
Boring food, what a pity as it could be a great venue for a great experience .... Was served warm white wine and some lame excuse to go with it! Food was seriously bland tasting! What a disappointment ... How can you mess up lobster bisque? Can bisque would taste better! Another put off was seeing hospitality staff not washing hands after leaving toilet!!!!
3
ate here with colleagues a few days ago. The food was fine - I had their spring salad and their tuna carpaccio appetizer as my entree. No complaints, but nothing particularly special either. Service was average. Portions are on the smaller side (fine for me, and it's always better not to overeat). I did not try their desserts. My colleagues tried the chocolage one and seemed to have liked it. Espresso was not good. The place is a bit out of the way in a converted chapel - charming, but overall not worth it in my view
1
A great setting spoiled by poor service and average food. * Our menus took 20 minutes to arrive and our bread rolls were stale* One of our party requested a salad from the tasting menu as a starter, but she was told that they only had 5 portions left so this wouldn't be possible (in case they needed them for guests ordering the tasting menu later on). This was understandable except that it was 9.50 at night by then.* The lobster bisque was inedible due to vast quantities of salt - it was probably busy reducing as it arrived 8 minutes after everyone else's starters* The wine list was so out of date that none of the vintages we requested were available. We were eventually sold the same wine from the same vineyard but 2 years younger for the same price as the older wine - poor value* We weren't informed of specials until we ordered our meals* We requested coffee at the end of the meal - the restaurant was still busy at 10.40pm but we were told that they couldn't do coffee as the machine was being chemically cleaned for the night* Desserts were good, everything else was average.* Still water came in plastic bottles* Impossible to catch the eye of any of the waiting staff - they just never looked round.I have been wanting to try the White Rabbit for a while but it was a total disappointment

Reviews of the WR range from lousy to fantastic. Can everyone be reviewing the same restaurant? Perhaps the restaurant's service and food are inconsistent and it really depends on your luck.I myself had a wonderful time with a few friends when we met for dinner at the WR this week. The setting is lovely - in a restored old military chapel, and located in the lush Dempsey hill area just off Orchard Road (it's opposite Singapore's Botanic gardens) and which used to be Singapore's military barracks when the British were here. The area is now a trendy restaurant and bar enclave.We were continuously offered bread (ciabatta or onion buns) while waiting for our mains, which did take a while as the restaurant was packed on a Thursday night. Service was attentive and discrete. I'm guessing a few of the servers may have been newbies and/or foreign staff (Singapore imports a lot of service staff from the region), as one did not understand our request for olive oil and balsamic vinegar, however this was very smoothly resolved when our request was escalated to a more senior server.We shared a spinach salad, which was very nicely dressed with a perfectly poached egg. I thoroughly enjoyed my macaroni and cheese main, a clever upmarket take on a comfort food favourite. Good cheese, baked ever so slightly with a crisp skin, and taken to new heights with a hint of truffles. My friends also enjoyed their mains.Mains are about S$28- S$30+, unless you order one of the more expensive menu options. The total cost for the 5 of us came to about S$250, including 4 glasses of wine. Note: When offered "still or sparkling water" in Singapore restaurants, it is ok to ask for "regular water", which means tap (safe to drink in Singapore). This should save you the expense of costly bottled water. We did not have any problems with asking for regular water at the WR and our water glasses were topped up regularly.The restaurant also has an outdoor bar area, which could make for pleasant before or after dinner drinks, although there are plenty of other places for drinks in the Dempsey area
4
What I like about WR and makes me return when in town for business:Beautiful setting in Dempsey HillBeautiful old chapel converted into the restaurantVery good food - the fois gras is amazing!Comfort food - known for their macaroni and cheese with truffle oil (the day I went was cold and rainy so perfect to have)Nice although quiet atmosphereSome staff are very nice and helpful, when get their attentionWhat I didnt like this timeThe service was slow, apathetic and snooty with our serverBusy restaurant and only 2 bathrooms (I had to use the mens)For a starter, main, & 2 drinks, I paid 101.22 Singapore dollars with 7% tax and 10% service charge.I would recommend you take the woman in your life here for a special, quiet, romantic dinne
4
Had the Degustation menu at White Rabbitt and thoroughly recommend it. It's not cheap but the four courses were almost faultless, the service very friendly and unobtrusive and the ambience excellent. Kamal was the stand out waiter as he put in extra effort and the few little touches made all the difference.
4
This restaurant is in a converted church, imaginatively repurposed. I went with my adult son, and we had a really excellent meal with great service. I started with the primavera salad followed by the risotto - all tasty and attractively presented. The sauteed foie gras that my son had for an appetizer was among the best I have ever had. I would definitely recommend this place
4
Emjoyed a wonderful meal here being well attended to by staff and enjoyed the relaxed ambience of this converted church.
2
Overpriced, very poor service, average food, and we tried it twice. Will never return.
1
Unfortunately we never made it even after several attempts at booking a table. It is a great location but the level of service is shocking. I have been there for a drink and it has a good layout but, again, service was an issue.
3
I feel this place is rather over priced. Simple breakfast for 3 costs more than $100. I could get much better food elsewhere in Singapore for that price.
5
A great location for a business lunch, good use of flavour and attention to detail from well trained staff. If you like to eat well prepared food in an unusual location (church) then make the effort and visit this lovely restaurant
5
I was there for a special event - the setting in this former church is beautiful, service excellent, food fun. Take the time and find this place.

The wife took me out for lunch during the week. We chose the White Rabbit as it is relatively close to work and has its own parking.At lunch, the restaurant has a three course set menu at 38S$++. This is likely the best choice, as it is a selection of dishes from the a la carte menu, with about five starters, mains, and deserts to choose from. According to waiters, the starters and deserts are somewhat smaller than a la carte, while the the mains is the same size.We had chosen a la carte, risotto vs lasagne. The risotto, usually with mushrooms, was prepared with other vegetables instead. Cooked to perfection, the only downside was the somewhat small size. The foie gras on top was melt- in- mouth, excellent. As an a la carte dish, it came at about the price of the set lunch. Meanwhile, the spinach lasagne with mushrooms was al dente and the flavours were nicely balanced.Due to the small size of the dishes, we had room for desert: signature dish crepes suzette, flambe at the table, and a "foret noir" combination of mousse au chocolat, brandy cherries, jelly and chocolate sponge. Both extremely palatable.Sadly, we were served a bottle of still water at a very steep S$10.In sum, we ended up paying 128S$, which we found too much for what we got. This explains the three star rating; the service and food, though, were good enough to make us come back.A full menu is available from their website at http://www.thewhiterabbit.com.sg/docs/food_menu.pd

We were at the White Rabbit for Christmas lunch. It cost over $800 for 4 adults (2 bottles of champagne was $200) There was no wow factor about the food which was a banquet. We thought it was odd that breakfast cereal was part of a lunch menu and a guy was standing there the whole time with his fairy floss machine. Whilst there was a lot of food there was nothing that you wanted to have seconds for. Desserts had fake cream. The restaurant seemed to have a lot of staff, probably too many as it seemed chaotic and they were still setting up when we arrived for lunch at 1pm. Now got to pay off the credit card for an experience that was very ordinary
5
A friend suggested we try The White Rabbit. With a name like that who wouldn't agree. The restaurant is located in an old church in the Dempsy Hill area. The dining room is open air with cozy booths lining each wall. We absolutely loved every dish we ordered! The food is outstanding! I would suggest the White Rabbit for intimate dinners with foodie friends. It is not too formal in terms of attire so be relaxed and come hungry. For after dinner drinks check out the Rabbit Hole bar.

I took my husband for his birthday this year. The restaurant got glowing reviews. The old chapel conversion promised rich architectural interest, replete with stained glass windows. The website cleverly utilised Lewis Carroll’s wondrous creativity. The menu contained some positively exquisite dishes. What could go wrong?For starters, staff seemed confused when I introduced myself on arrival and I asked whether they’d received my email. Obviously, since this was the email with special instructions for public humiliation in the form of singing, fireworks and plate inscriptions for my husband’s big birthday, I couldn’t very well go ahead and spill its contents to the maitre d’ who appeared to be all smiles and no clues.After much shuffling about and two rounds of microwaved bread—soft and delicious, but you have to eat it within five seconds; after that it’s only good for stone masonry or hammer throw events—a member of staff did come to our table to give me several conspicuous winks and nudges, and to reassure me that they had indeed found my email. Clearly, it was going to be a long way down the rabbit hole.In preparation, I ordered a good bottle of French. Don’t judge. Very high expectations were placed on the 2005 Tardieu-Laurent Côtes-du-Rhône containing 13 Southern Rhône grape varieties. It arrived with pomp and circumstance. Upon a closer inspection, we found out we’d been given a 2004 bottle. Upon inquiry, the staff revealed they’d ran out of 2005 (it was a better year in Southern France) and decided a 2004 replacement was good enough. No need to ask us, of course; we are just the CUSTOMER PAYING AN ARM AND A LEG, AND OUR FIRST BORN CHILD for this bottle! Grumble, grumble. Rant, rant.Well, folks, you saw it coming: 2004 was a sour viticultural disappointment. For the better part of the night the promised dark red fruit and plums seemed thin on the nose, thin on the palate and “generally quite trim”. (A shout-out to Eddie Izzard, a contemporary comedic genius). The wine was flat, one-dimensional and very tart—it did not taste anything like a 7-year-old wine. Only after it had breathed for a couple of hours, it began to round off pleasantly in the back of the palate, developed some layering and a hint of spice and oakiness, but it was well beneath our expectations. What’s the point of ordering a good bottle of wine, if it’s going to be drinkable only after dessert? And drinkable is rather a low standard. Upscale restaurants would do well to offer a decanting service against a deposit.Food-wise, it was a mixed bag. We were somewhat taken aback by the food offering, which appeared a veritable jumble of casual and fine dining. Strangely enough, they did not have rabbit on the menu, but if you craved some mac and cheese, you’d come to the right place.We finally selected our hors d’oeuvres. My husband ordered the Camembert Parcels (note the plural) and I chose the Shallot Tarte Tatin. I was prepared to love the Camembert Parcels. Being Bulgarian, I’m partial to cheese and phyllo dough, and especially to the combination of the two. I could almost taste the soft hot oozing Camembert against the crunchy phyllo pastry. It was going to be indecent. Unfortunately, we got only one Camembert parcel, which had likely been baked last year—the cheese was not only not oozing, but stone cold, and the phyllo pastry was going soggy.The Shallot Tart Tatin made a better showing, although it had a strangely sugary glaze on top. You don’t need additional sugar in a shallot and goat’s cheese tart tatin. First, it’s not a dessert, it’s a starter. Second, the shallots have enough natural sweetness, which they release in the process of sautéing and natural caramelisation. In fact, adding sugar masks the subtle sweetness of the shallots. Third, the rocket salad was limp and beginning to go yellow.The mains were probably this place’s only saving grace. My husband had Tournedos Rossini. The beautiful filet mignon with foie gras and black truffle shaving over mash, spring vegetables and truffle sauce was to die for. The filet arrived a perfect medium rare, beautifully complemented by the rich smoky foie gras and musky nuttiness of the truffle. The mash was smooth and creamy, the vegetables slightly crunchy and the rich truffle sauce brought everything together beautifully.My Braised Oxtails were absolutely delightful: rich, well-seasoned and cooked to the point of falling off the bone. Served with spring vegetables over creamy rich mash, they were absolutely delicious. Only, the portion was big enough for two fully-grown sumo players. Really? Four huge oxtails in a pile? Were you trying to get rid of them? This is supposed to be fine dining, not a family-style restaurant.Half-comatose from the sour wine and the huge portions, and after many meaningful stares in the direction of any member of staff (we were getting desperate), we finally managed to get their attention. I decided to skip dessert and my husband only ordered the Crêpes Suzette so as not to thwart my birthday surprise, which staff made all too apparent was forthcoming. Thankfully, he was saved the singing, and the table-side flambé fulfilled the fireworks requirement. The crêpes were served on a white plate tastefully inscribed with chocolate but were, unfortunately, drenched in orange juice. As my husband said, they were “not inedible”. Yes, that’s what we were aiming for.It took us another ten years to pay and the only time anyone inquired about our experience was when I had one foot in our taxi—that’s called duress, my dear. Bottom line: There were quite a few mistakes that have no place in fine dining. In this price range, we won’t be going back. The White Rabbit would do well to slash its prices (at least) in half and market itself as a casual brasserie rather than a fine-dining restaurant. That title would certainly fit in better with the rickety tables and the paper placemats. Seriously, people

Best service I experienced within my 2.5 years in Singapore. Food is very good within a casual atmosphere.

A great restaurant located on Dempsey Hill. Have a drink in the gardens before heading inside for a brilliant meal. A nice change from the noise of the city. Well worth a visit.

As a family we visited the White Rabbit Restuarant at Tanglin. This is a familiar building as it was the place that my wife and I got married with it being a former church. It is a bit out of the tourist route but well worth the visit. The food is of a high standard and well presented in an unusual surrounding. The menu and drinks are 5 star quality. If you are lucky enough to be welcomed by Kamal then you can be assured of good service.you can also check their menu on their website www.thewhiterabbit.com.sgHappy eatin

Went here to celebrate my birthday. Really enjoyed the surroundings set in an old chapel.The food was delicious and contrary to other reviews , the service was fine if not a little over-attentive especially when it came to selling us more wine.That's my only gripe really but then it's my gripe everywhere in Singapore ! Perfectly drinkable wine (nothing really special) at $100 a bottle.For a meal for 6 add $300+ to the food bill

Went here recently with my wife and some friends from out of town. The food was good although the service was appalling. Seemed to take forever to take our order. After 10 minutes came back to tell us one of the starters was off the menu so I had to pick something. Having done this the waitress comes back 10 minutes later to tell us one of the other starters is also off so, my wife and friend also had to pick something else. When we asked why they hadn't told us why the other starters were off at the same time, we got a sarcastic comment from the waitress that if we had ordered earlier our selections might have been available. When the starters came they all came at different times as with the main course. When we came to pay the bill was all over the place. Tried to charge us for drinks we didnt have, including $300 for a bottle of whiskey, tried to charge us for the starters that we had ordered as first but then were off the menu as well as the ones that we did have. Staff were rude and surly, quite frankly was embarrassed that I took my friends here for their one night in Singapore

I went to this restaurant one lunch time with my son - he lives in Singapore and a friend of his recommended it. We had a very enjoyable lunch - the food and wine were excellent. The decor and ambience great - as was the service. I don't know the cost but, as my son didn't complain, I would say it was acceptable. He has since taken a work colleague from UK there and they had the same good experience

My partner, a friend and my self went to White Rabbit yesterday evening. The restaurant is located in an old church which dates back to the colonial days which, makes for a superb setting.I had the duck, my other half had the scallop linguine, the food was great... the service was very good! combined with a deal on Mumm champagne, the whole experience was fantastic! definately recommend it

Went for a Saturday dinner with my wife - altough it's exactly the kind of place for a candle light dinner, we expected a li'l more from the place.Since we were there for ' going out', and not very hungry, spent $110 for two, but be prepared to spend 80-90 per stomach if you have a good appetite. I felt not all the staff is super courteous as the reviews suggest, so you'll have great service if you're lucky, and good-average otherwise. All n all, a must go place, preferably just before sunset-early dinner, but don't keep too high hopes

I was looking forward to finally eating here, yet a bit nervous given some of the previous reviews. Had a business dinner with colleagues from SG and my bosses from the US. As it turns out, my nervousness was not warranted in the least.PROS: The food was top-notch, and the wine list quite extensive. The converted church space is a lovely environment in which to dine. NEUTRAL: the service was OK...much better than I've had in some restaurants here, but that's not too difficult. I'd expect slightly better, though, given the prices. PSEUDO-CON: the dessert list was fairly limited, and could have been ripped from the 80s -- baked alaska.. crepes suzette flamed tableside (they were actually quite nice, but still)

Decor was good, at one point the echo was annoying but the company and food was decent. For the price you pay? you could have deserved more with regards to the service. Let me just clarify, not all the staff has no sense of customer service, it's mainly the ladies who were serving there which maid the experience not as good as expect. Maybe I expected too much, but with all the hype about the decor and being on dempsey hill? They certainly need to brush up on their customer service. Once again, not everyone there was bad, infact the gentlemen serving the bread had the best service. A simple smile, a simple question- Would you like to have more bread?- in the nicest tone. Not sure if it was due to the service that made the food alil blahhhhhhh

Really good food - had a 6 course set menu. Everything was lovely!

Tres chic ambience and menu. But food lacks authenticity and staff is clueless about good service. In a nutshell, white rabbit hops hard in wooing but not in winning customers with discerning tastes.

i went to this sweet restaurant with 2 female work colleagues. its twee but not formal. you very well could see alice in wonderland having lunch here whilst she looks for the white rabbit on the golf course.beautiful setting in an old church in lush dempsey hill.the food and wine was very good. the service was fine. it sounds crazy but order at least a side dish of the macaroni and cheese - their signature dish. it is scandalously worth it

This is a restaurant where I occasionally have working lunches but I seldom come for dinner. The previous time we had dinner, it was very good food as well as service so we thought we would try it again with some friends who have not been here. It was crowded and the staff overlooked our updated guest numbers but that was easily addressed. Service was not as good as before - I notice that many of the service staff had changed. The starters were still very good and the pasta as well as risotto mains were as well. The person who had the duck confit was a tad disappointed as the meat was on the dry side - a dish I had found excellent before. Dessert was good.The bill came to about $60 per person with only 2 having glasses of house wine.Overall we had a good dinner despite the service being slower and one dish not to one guests liking. I would have recommended the duck before this visit. The risotto and warm spinach salad are 2 dishes still worth trying

I went recently and was very impressed with the overall offering. The starters and meats were standout, i especially liked the shallot tart, and salad printemp. The service was prompt and warm, despite the restaurant being packed out on a Wednesday night. I liked the tableside service- they wheeled out a deeper Suzette counter and it was a stunning end to an already great meal. Certainly a must see in Singapore

This restaurant has all the right ingredients to be great but it has been a disappointment. Have been there for lunch once and 3 times since for dinner. One dinner- a birthday dinner for 2 friends turned out to be one of the best dinners I've had in singapore in terms of food, service and ambience. We started off in outdoor bar area which is cheerful, festive, and drink list is excellent. The foie gras was memorable. The last 2 visits surprised as as the food was a disappointment (portions were not generous), we had to send the soup back as it was not hot, and the plates were not hot for the main courses. The staff is plentiful but amateurish. This was in contrast to the first 2 visits when we were left with a very good impression

Booked in June for boxing day. Website gave the impression of a slick operation...don't be fooled!Decor is dull and uninspired, like sitting in an old school canteen but with modern lighting. Considering it was Christmas there was not a decoration in site.Food is mediocre and looks better on the menu than on the plate. Had the daily special, three slices of turkey with some cubes of roasted veg, which cost around 30 Euros - & you have to pay a further 6 for side dishes to make it into a meal (I opted for mash that had a pouring consistency!)Service was a bit hit and miss considering a large brigade of staff, many of whom had earpieces and walkie-talkies, more. In-keeping with security staff than waiting staff.The final point is the extortionate price of wine, though appreciate not helped by high duty in Singapore. Cheapest bottle of red was around 40 Euros which I know started off it's life at 5 !All in all a disappointment

We had an great meal here at The White Rabbit last evening. The ambiance is contemporary but warm, the service is superb and the cooking top class. We chose the pork belly and scallop brochette starter, followed by the 48hr cooked ribs and sole. The starter was excellent, the scallops were cooked to perfection and the pork belly was melt in the mouth delicious. The mains were just as good, the ribs melted and the sole was perfectly cooked. We shared a panna cotta for dessert, lovely. We felt there could have been more of a gap between the starter and the main, but overall couldn't fault the service. The wine and bottled water is pricey (but that's just Singapore all over anyway). Highly recommended for a romantic night out, definitely book a booth as opposed to sitting in the middle of the restaurant

This restaurant is situated in an old chapel like building on Dempsey so competition is fierce. The evening we visited the restaurant was close to full but service was attentive, almost too efficient. Our entrees arrived very quickly, before our cocktails and consequently the restaurant missed out on further sales of alchohol as we did not have time to finish our first round of drinks before our main meals were presented. Personal choice but we like to sit and savour our food unless we have a pressing engagement. The creme brulee for dessert was one of the best I've had. There is a nice outdoor bar for pre/after dinner drinks

We visited here after a morning in the heat at the botanical gardens, so the cool interior of this church was a welcome escape. While the menu is not particuarly inventive, the food is good and the setting is peaceful...Well worth a visit for lunch
