My daughter loves Eric Kayser and this one did not disappoint. Not quite the selection as the bakeries in Paris but still a nice variety of tasty treats!
3
The quality is fine and certainly better than Pauls, but the space feels like a hole in the wall and needs a more refined sense of décor and ambiance commensurate with the brand.

Visited the outlet at Raffles Place which has a pretty nice ambience. Look the pretty pastries here. The drinks are nice too. It's a great place to chill out with friends.
4
Perfect range of pastries and delicious too. Great location for office goers.... The wide choice of selections leaves people spoils for choice....
5
You just don't know what to choose too many good products love this place.
Nice to have a brunch on the weekend !
5
Finally a great place to hang out and enjoy good coffee and amazing bread. A paradise for the bread lovers. The cake are also delicious.

With a love for eclairs, we dropped in to try an eclair and a few other sweets from their pastry selection.
The pastry wasn't anything special but it was a nice atmosphere to dine in.
4
we just wanted to have a snack and cafe. there bred is very good and tasty. cafe ist ok. service was also ok. will go there again soon.
5
I was starving but not ready for a meal, and came by here to grab a little something. My eyes focused on the slice of orange cake, and it was the best piece of cake I've ever tasted. Moist, fragrant, a little chewy - it just hit all the right spots. Don't miss this
4
As the cafe is located in the corner open space next to the escalator, the tables are laid out quite close to one another.Although it's in view of people riding up and down the escalator,It does have a cosy feel to it.We were there just after lunch, it was relatively empty and quiet.We had the 'high tea' set for three which comprised both savouries like quiche, tuna canapÃ©s and ham sandwiches and sweets like mini fondants, brownies and tarts plus coffee and tea of choice.The sweet selection was delicious but way too sweet for all 3 of us, we had only morsels and left most of it untouched. There were about 5-6 tea choices listed on the menu but most of them were struck out as they were not available.
4
The croissant here is just delicious. So light and buttery. We had a croissant and coffee which is a perfect way to start your day. Easy to get a table.
5
Fantastic black olive bread + great customer service
5- cereal baguette is good too.
Staff very friendly and helpful. Able to explain why the outlet at Wheelock place was closed recently too.

i accidentally seat here because my daughter hungry
and turns out the breakfast choco croissant and fresh orange juice was really niceee
then we tried the ham and cheese croissant wewww still awesome
hehehehheeh

With the hustle and bustle of shopping belt Orchard Road, Kayser at Scotts Scotts is a good place to stop for a drink or a tea/coffee break. The pastries are the highlight.
5
I visited Maison Kayser to have a quick breakfast. I ordered Le Tuna Sandwich, which is a a big tuna sandwich with fresh baked bread and fresh lettuce, and it tasted very good. The cafe had a wide variety of pastries too. Enjoy!!
5
The pastel green signboard at Scotts Square drew my attention each time I rode the escalator. It was too tempting looking at the wide array of breads and pastries each time I visited Scotts Square. I caved in and finally made a visit when they just opened for business on a Sunday. I was very happy that I did not have to jostle with a crowded cafe that morning and I could have a relaxing post-breakfast. Although I had breakfast at home, the eclairs were just too tempting to give a pass! So I opted for a coffee eclair and a cappucino. I was not disappointed. The eclair tasted lovely and perfect, not overly sweet, smothering my tastebuds in every mouthful. The cappucino was also freshly brewed perfectly. Pricing is as expected for such a cafe offering delectable and carefully baked breads and pastries. In my books, it is value for money for such wonderful baking creations. It was a most delightful post-breakfast morning. With the wide selection of breads and pastries, there are opportunities for repeat visits to this baking paradise, to sample the wonderful baking creations. Highly recommended

I am French and We went there for a breakfast and ordered 2 tartines.you think you would get French baguette like every one would expect. instead it turns out to be 2 slices of home made white bread gardenia type.... A shame for a French bakery honestly. we asked them to change but they refused and told us it is management decision. Ahhh if management says so I would like to invite them to visit a bakery in France again..

I've been in SG more than a year now and months ago I picked up a chocolate chip cookie to-go somewhere. I ate it waaay later at home and it was better than anything I had had in SG. I kept the label - it had this weird logo that looked like the Greek letter 'Chi' and a lower case 'e'. I could not find that place anywhere, and I was in despair! Today I stumbled upon the logo and bought the cookie again! Yup. I personally prefer chocolate chips to chunks, and this is definitely chunks (bigger globs of chocolate). And it's dark which is good because this is a rich, sweet confection. Walnut is a strong flavor that stands up well to the chocolate and the cookie dough part of the cookie is substantial, if a little sweet. There's not enough of it per cookie, (because it's the chunk kind and they are generous with the chunks), but if you like good chocolate, in cookie form, and don't mind nuts? Then you really should try this treat! I'll actually try food some other time. For now I'm just happy I found one good commercially available cookie here. It was tiring making my own... :-

My husband and I dropped by for a quick coffee during a precious 1 hour break. We ordered and waited 20 mins for our coffee although the cafe was less than half full. This was frustrating given the short break we had. After we finished we paid up right away. We thanked the girl at the cashier as a matter of courtesy (definitely loud enough) but to our surprise she neither responded nor even looked up! Wow! What awful service for the price we paid for 2 simple lattes! By the way, we also had to pay for the tap water! We won't be back.

Was wandering around orchard to kill time, and chanced upon Maison Kayser Singapore in the basement of the mall. Almost missed it since it is located behind the escalators. Tried out the croissant and pain au chocolat. Good stuff - would rate it on par with Paul Singapore which is my favourite for croissant - and perhaps slightly cheaper
1
Employee told me they close at 10 but I could NOT have a coffee or latte at 9:30. We live upstairs from MK and will provide feedback to our concierge.
5
pay alittle more for your bread at maison kayser and you will find what a difference in quality! i dream of those fluffy cinnamon rolls and buttery croissants every night. while you are there, grab a nice long black coffee with suzuki japanese beans.
3
Certainly better than Dome next door, but far from anything better than average. They close at 10PM, however coffee lovers beware as this popular coffee shop won't serve coffee after 9:30PM. So I must wonder, why not close at 930PM or offer all products up to closing time? We live in the Scotts Square building and as a neighbor, the experience is rather disappointing
4
Having lived in France, I miss the flaky fresh yummy croissants I used to get there! Croissants at Maison Kayser are the closest i've ever gotten to French bakery croissants and are a definite recommend! While Maison Kayser may be slightly on the expensive side, their varieties of bread are excellent and worth the extra dollars
2
Was there for breakfast and I felt like I had not eaten anything inspite of paying a lot. The service was average. The meals were small quantities. When one of my friends asked for some butter she was asked to pay extra for it. Isn't butter a standard item on a breakfast menu?Will not be going there again. Too disappointing
3
The title of this review sums up our experience - really really bad service - 1) waited for what seemed like ages before we were seated and yet there were stacks of empty tables 2) got our menus and then had to flag down a waiter to come and take our order - he did apologise for the long wait 3) the waiter came back four times to check that he got the order right -we were 3 people so hardly complicated and then the food arrived and yum yum yum - very generous portions and scrumptious
4
I needed a quick lunch in Singapore, so I purchased a baguette sandwich to take away. It was very good, particularly the delicious baguette. Friends later stopped by for a tea break after an afternoon of shopping. Again, the desserts we purchased for very good. This place can be busy, so time your visit accordingly. This is a pleasant place to take a break

Staying at Royal Plaza on Scotts in Singapore, no breakfast included so went to Wheelock Place and in Basement 2 went to MAISON KAYSER. Been there a few times over last couple of visits and the food is very good value - breakfast of bacon, eggs, croissant, tomatoes, salad and coffee under $20. Service very quick, polite staff and clean in nice surroundings two floors below Marks and Spencer
5
There a few branches in Singapore. I am a regular visitor to the wheellock Place branch. The breakfast is excellent and they are happy to cook the eggs in the style that you prefer. The French manager is friendly and welcoming. The staff can be at times rather slow.When the French manager is around,the service is excellent. A little expensive but worth it for a taste of excellent French bistro food

The sign at the entrance says "For dine in please wait (highlighted) here to be seated". We waited for 5 mins only to be served by a pointed finger gesturing a table by wait staff. Service is so poor you could not help but feeling the need to slap them for not smiling and speak rudely. Overall experience is disgusting! Their signature croissants are not even ready by 12noon on sunday. Why bother calling it signature in the first place! Foods served were delivered as if some one has placed a gun in their back. Not coming back..... EVER!
5
You have got to have breakfast here. Their coffee is superb as well as their bakery items. Pure pleasure.

Webt here for croissant as I hear they are the top 5 places to go for a croissant. It did not disappoint. It was served really nice buttery flaky and I really enjoyed it. Bought a few more for my colleagues for tea!
4
I was literally led to Maison Kayser by my nose - the aroma of freshly baked bread was too much to resist! I sampled both the Croissant (soft and flaky) and the Ciabatta (absolutely delicious), and had a cup of their Cappuccino (light and creamy). Their display is extremely tempting with a crazy variety of goodies. I'm definitely going back to sample the Fougasse and Danish pastries

I’d been at Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road, and was looking for a quiet place to eat. While I dearly love Singapore, sometimes one just seeks quiet. I chanced upon an entrance to Scott’s Square in the Scott’s Arcade Building, and discovered the basement. Fabulous. Great atmosphere and quiet.Three eateries caught my attention – Eastern & Oriental which seemed to have the most delectable desserts, Dome with its tempting assortment, and Maison Kayser, my final choice.I chose one of the set menus – soup of the day, and quiche for $(S)10.90 plus a caffé latte $(S)6.90. I ascertained the tomato soup was not from a can, and selected the cabbage and chorizo quiche. I like to explore something different.The coffee arrived first. My mistake, I hadn’t told them after the meal, please. Despite my instructions of “extra hot”, it was tepid. I sipped a couple of mouthfuls and decided to deal temperature issues later.The soup was served. Excellent full flavour and, again, tepid. A couple more mouthfuls and I took the plate to the counter to enquire if they had a microwave. Fortunately, an affirmative response, so after a couple of minutes, the soup was served to me again. Perfect! Delicious!The quiche came. Fabulous flavour, but no prize for guessing it too was sent to the microwave. Once hot, the quiche was really appetizing. No prize is awarded as to what happened to the coffee, which by this stage, was cold.Staff is to be congratulated for their reactions. They complied graciously with my requests. Maybe some local taste is for tepid food or maybe it’s a safety issue. Whatever the reason, however, I like food of this nature really hot and certainly not tepid. The food’s flavour once heated was great. I got used to coffee prices in Singapore, and at nearly $(S)7, by this stage I didn’t even flinch. I’ll be back in Singapore later this year and Maison Kayser will be on my list to revisitFor visitors to Singapore, one other bonus in the Scotts Square basement is a small supermarket with different produce from that available near my accommodation. It’s worth checking out while nearby.Three and a half stars

There's a sign at the entrance to Maison Kayser that says, "Please wait to be seated." If you arrive at 9:45 am, as we did, you'll have to wait a long, long time to get seated. We had to go to the counter, buy croissants, and take part of our order to a table. All three ladies behind the counter were very smiley, friendly, and unmotivated. We paid first for croissants, coffee, rolls and orange juice and sat down, but they forgot to bring the orange juice. Aside from the occasional take-out customer, there was no other customer in the restaurant. They could use a supervisor from any Mcdonalds branch to orient the staff toward customers. Their coffee was good, and their croissant was excellent. Prices were high. When we left, we noticed that at the Dome coffee shop next to Maison Kayser, about ten tables were occupied, and Maison Kayser had only one table occupied. Maison Kayser is an appropriate place to buy an excellent croissant, but hardly an appropriate place to impress a date at 9:45 am

The choux al a creme was excellent...as was the granduja eclair. The Blue Mountain Coffee was reliable and aromatic, although I am surprised they charge s$6.80 for coffee expressed out of an automatic coffee machine--no barista, just someone behind the bar who pushes a button. Service was quite sub-par even for by mediocre Singapore standards. The waiter served the pastries even before providing the table with tableware. A few minutes later after the knife and fork arrived, it was very noticeable the fact none of the flatware was cleaned in a professional dishwasher--water spot stains were everywhere on the flatware. When asked to replace the knife and fork with cleaner ones, the waiter ignored the request and said that is how they 'clean' the flatware. Wow. Such a minor request for a dining venue which is not fast food, yet the simple request could not be accommodated. It was particularly surprising that they could not help given the fact the restaurant was not even 60% full even around 2pm on a Saturday. Very disappointed with service. We will unlikely ever come back to dine in, but would certainly come back for their takeaway pastry counter. I recommend their baguette--it is superb--just don't dine in! ;

I didn't dine-in here, but I sure did buy a big haul of their fantastic pastries. Not necessarily the best in Singapore, but good enough for me. They are famous for their croissants, which are really good. A good selection of pastries and breads here, but not suited for smaller budgets

More food photos & reviews on my blog: www.jerjerjer.comThere aren’t many choices for mains at Maison Kayser if you’re looking for something heavy to fill your tummy. The menu is dominated mainly with salads and sandwiches which they are famous for. They even bake all their bread fresh everyday! Well, I didn’t quite fancy the choices of sandwiches they had so I decided to go for their Steak Loin Spaghetti ($13).Check out the medium rare piece of meat – it’s perfectly the way I like my steak. The outside is char-grilled to perfection while the inside is still pink and juicy! I’m not much of a meat lover, but this cut of steak is simply so tender that it melts in my mouth. You would have expected something tougher based on its char-grilled appearance. But it turned out surprisingly good!Their Raspberry Tart or Tarte au Framboise ($5.80) is also so super-deliciously-awesome! It’s not too sweet and the raspberries are not that sour too. The tart base is also really crumbly and buttery. There is actually another outlet nearby at Scotts Square, so I'll probably check that out next time to takeaway more of their yummy desserts

Went to the outlet in Basement 2 in Wheelock Place along Orchard Road.The eclairs are deliciously sinful. Chocolate, vanilla and coffee - 3 flavorsome varieties to choose from ....Or if you can't make the choice like me, just get all 3! Filled to the brim with rich cream in soft pastry. The lemon meringue was the perfect combination of tart lemon and sweet custard in a shortcrust pastry

Click HERE! http://www.dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/03/maison-kayser-singapore-tarts.html for FULL ReviewMy first encounter with Maison Kayser is in Japan N years ago. Never did I expect it would make its foray into Singapore one day. They are famous for the croissants and other artisan bread but I would like to write about their sweets instead.One should not mistaken this Carre Tartin for an average apple crumble because this is much complicated in terms of the baking technique. The apples are caramelized and consolidated into jelly, producing a bittersweet taste that balances the Vanilla white chocolate mousse. The best part comes when you sink into the crunchy base that is dotted with cookies crumbles and grinded nuts.Having tried their outstanding eclairs previously, their Custard Cream Puff failed to shine equally as the choux pastry does not have the crusty bite on the surface which I looked out for.Nonetheless, this Tarte Monge emerged as a very well-executed pastry draped with tangy Red Berries. The unique selling point lies in the use of White Cheese which is not too satiating.For other unique eats like tart brazilian and giant cookie monster, visit http://www.dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/03/maison-kayser-singapore-tarts.htm
