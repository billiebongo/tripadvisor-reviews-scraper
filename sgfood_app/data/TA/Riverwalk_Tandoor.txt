Excellent indian food, with good starters, mains, and desserts. Must try garlic naan.
Atmosphere is great.
Located at Singapore’s central area, by the Singapore river.
4
Restaurant its really good very beautiful location nut its too crowded since they cater for big indian groups so the food quality is really nice but only thing is too crowded so its great for family and couple as well
4
the food is well prepared and extremely tasty with great vegetarian options. beware of the naan basket --you could find yourself with 16!!!

After a long walk from Merlin park through the Riverside we arrived at Clarke quay. It's a good restaurant serves you well with tasty food but it's little expensive as compared to in little India but we you are coming to Clarke quay or Merlin park and you wanna have Indian food just drop in. Remember it's little expensive 
4
Just had a great dinner here, this place has been around for years I used to come here many years ago, but stopped as the standards started to drop.However the place as been newly renovated and the lay out is very nice.The food is great the service is also very good, then the price is excellent.If like me you were having doubts about going here, don’t it’s well worth it
2
Basic food, catering to tour groups, which means the place is crowded, the queue is always long and the food is always gone. Not recommended for walk in dining. They should have a different section for groups alone, so that walk in guests have a better dining experience. Will not patronize again
5
The restaurant went through renovations since visited them few years ago. New interior looks nice. We ordered dinner buffet. Price was reasonable after an inhouse promotion. The buffet spread was good, enough variety to choose from for non-vegetarians and vegetarian person. Lamb vindalu is highly recommended
4
After renovation ambience is better but cost is on higher side for the food they serve. Buffet is not worth the money, if you are slightly late food might be cold . A La Carte food is average, more oil doesn't allow you to have more quantity. Visit only if you need Indian food as there are less choices in the area.
5
This restaurant was right across from our hotel so we thought we would give it a try. It was an inspired choice. The restaurant was simply decorated but the food and service were outstanding. The meals were delicious and even with alcoholic drinks our bill did not exceed $60.00 Singapore for 2 people. If we were here another night we would visit again, It's just a shame we are leaving tomorrow. If you want a great and authentic Indian meal visit this restaurant

We tried the buffet lunch option today. The price (16 SGD per person) is certainly cheap (dinner is 22 pp). However there were limited food options for a vegetarian- there were two vegetables (Corn palak paneer and Potato with Cauliflower), Dal and then salad and vegetarian soup(not tasty at all). The corn palak paneer was decently tasty - the other two were rather bland. There was salad, raita and papad. There were two other non-vegetarian dishes. The service was very good - the two servers were friendly and taking away plates or helping as and when needed. For dessert there was Gulab Jamun (hot) -not so good - and Sevaiya Kheer(cold) -decent. They served a basket of fresh naans as and when needed at the table. Overall an ok experience- nothing specially tasty, but very easy on the wallet. The location is superb-by the riverside, so during night time it must be a nicer. Please note there was a board which said it will be shut down for renovation from August 1, so don't go before checking that
4
We were group of 40.
We had dinner buffet. The Crispy Karela (bitter gourd) Was deliciously awesome.
Good spread of vegetarian dishes. However the Peshawari halwa got over and they served normal halwa
5
excellent food , good location ,good buffet range, nice staff too definitely recommend for Indian cuisine lovers.
1
The staff here feel that you are eating food for free and do not help at all. So all your hunger and taste goes for a six with such rude staff.
4
Wife and I had a buffet lunch here. Value for money place, considering that the Clarke Quay area is generally expensive. Good spread available for the buffet. Crowds of Indian patrons (like myself) indicates authentic taste. :)
4
I've visited this place multiple times, located very conveniently in the Clarke Quay area, usually before a night out with friends for a few drinks. The food is good, atmosphere is clean, and definitely value-for-money. Never had any problem with the service staff either. Naan top-ups during buffet was prompt, buffet had an interesting variety to the food offered. There are always a good selection of both vegetarian and meat dishes available. All in all, never had an unpleasant experience during my numerous (must've been 6 or 7 times now) there
4
I started with the samosas which seemed rather bland, so I was a bit worried, but then the garlic naan was great and the tandoori chicken was just fantastic, perfect texture and great flavouring. So, it's excellent food but you can certainly get this good Indian for a lot less elsewhere, so you want to be keen on a night out by the river to make it worthwhile
4
It's Northern Indian cuisine lunch buffet for our excursion with a total 40 pax. It's a good experience for Indian dining for dishes full of spices. Nice table setup and the service is good. Saw the banner with a promotion price now at $16/pax for lunch buffet, really worth the price.

Riverwalk Tandoor is a nice Indian Cuisine Restaurant. It serves good Indian food. It has great ambiance, has sitting arrangements both indoor and out door. At the entrance, they have a nice Punjabi village theme with a few Punjabi mannequins, It seems to be owned by a Punjabi Indian.Having stayed in India for a substantial duration, I strongly feel that they miss the authentic Indian Touch in their food. It may be fine for people who have not tasted the authentic Indian food in India. This is why I am rating them a 3 star
2
The appearance of the hotel looked nice. The restaurant is indeed located at a good location easily accessible for people staying in or around little India and Farrer park. The food also tastes ok. But, the price you pay for that kind of food is a little unjustified. The restaurant charges about $22 Singapore dollars on weekends per person for its buffet and $19 on weekdays. And what was extremely disappointing was the quality if their food. Everything was still ok until I found fried ants on my papadoms. I am not sure what quality of oil they use or how many times they reuse the same ingredients. So I would not recommend my readers to go to this restaurant. Its over expensive( for the kind of food they serve) and the quality of their food is questionable
4
I have visited Riverwalk Tandoor couple of times and it serves really good vegetarian food (since I'm vegetarian). The unlimited buffet served at the restaurant is value for money and the best part is breads (naan/roti)are served fresh from the tandoor as required. Definitely a place to visit again.
5
Very tasty Indian food in a cosy atmosphere in all seasons, prompt and efficient service, courteous staff and enough seats for rush hours also.
4
This place is near Clarke Quay MRT. Its good for a large group too. They have buffet as well as a la carte. We ordered from the menu. The food was hot and good. Not too spicy or oily. We sat outdoors facing the river.
4
Enjoyed our buffet lunch in this very spacious and well decorated modern tandoori restaurant, food was very good with plenty of dishes very attentive waiters
1
Avoid this place. There are many options in Singapore. This place might be included in your itinerary by your travel agency, please opt out. You can do better.
4
As the name says it is beside the Singapore river . The food and buffet is good . It is very popular with the tour groups and office people .
5
Food was amazing.
Had biryani and paneer kadhai, very good authentic Indian restaurants.
Average 30-35SGD$ for couples
5
Restaurant is beautifully placed for you to choose river facing (outdoor) or air conditioned seating. This restaurant is totally not about the quantity but the extreme powerful and vast colours of taste and fragrance. Naan is served to you fresh automatically everytime your basket is about to finish. Great tea on a seperate menu is availble. Indian chai. Awesome place for the natives.
3
Great location beside the river, and great for people watching. If you enjoy a nice lively atmosphere, this place has it. The service is good - but I regard all service outside my native UK as good, because it's always better than at home - so maybe nothing special. All that aside, I just didn't rate the food as anything more than a run-of-the-mill takeaway or restaurant you can find anywhere. Having said all that, a large party who were celebrating a birthday shared their cake with us, which was a very nice gesture and much appreciated
4
We came here with our daughters a few years ago so decided to look it up again for just the two of us. We had been starved of spicy food for 4 weeks in France (cheese is nice but there is a limit) so we were hanging out for a curry. We had pakora, followed by black pepper prawns and aloo ghobi, with rice and naan. We ate early so were the first in, consequently the service was excellent and the food fresh and hot. We again enjoyed the meal and would be happy to return.
1
Typically a group addressing restaurant. I think this place only caters to groups . Walked in a group myself. Good was very mediocre. Not a single serving staff spoke a single word of checked with the guests what they would like.The fish curry and butter chicken was passable. A serving staff named Abhishek crossed all limits asking our group to leave and sit outside as another group is awaited. Until 2 pm there was no group in site. Definitely not coming here
3
We took dinner on the asking of our trip operator Tourland but very disappointing . nothing special , average in all manner.
4
The buffet is available at very reasonable price. Nans (type of roti) were given unlimited.1 Soup, desserts were available. No separate drinks. It can be ordered at additional price. Overall, good buffet at economical price.
3
I have been over 50 times in last 10 years, standard menu 365 days, very rare that you see juicy tandoor chicken, tastes like you are eating dry meat. Naans are good, methifish is good.. mmm, OK OK lah
5
RWT is centrally located and specialises in Indian food. The food is not spicy and hence suited our palate. A bit expensive but the taste makes up for it. Do try the Goan fish curry with a glass of Lassi!
5
Affordable north indian buffet spread. Good scenario on the outside but not in the inside. Otherwise good service from the waitress.
2
The food taste were not great at all. The choices were less and the tandoori chicken was very dry and wasnt tempting at all. There was no chicken curry/gravy at all in the buffet. It is definitely not worth the money spent here. Before even we sat and got started with the food, the waiter asked about what drinks would you have. We ordered few and at the end only we realised their intentions. The mango lassi alone is costing 8$ plus GST plus Service charge. This on top of the Buffet cost of 17.90$ + GST + SC. The total cost was close to 30$ per person. For this price, there are many many other restaurants which offer excellent food. I would not go there again
4
The location of the restaurant is awesome with amazing outside river views. Located near Bumboat river cruise..u will find the Indian Punjabi traditional theme outside the restaurant. We had business lunch over 30 people. Food was very good. We tried Paneer, daal, pulao, naans, desserts were also nice. Staff was courteous. Good place to handout specially in the evening.
4
We went here for the all you can eat at dinnertime. We were given entrees to eat at the table which were great then helped ourselves to some mains. The food was great though there were only a couple of meat dishes to choose from so this is better suited to those who like vegetarian meals (our family are much mire into meat then veggies). The service was great and as we got there at the opening of their dinner service we were the first there and the place never got too busy while we were there
2
Had visited the place for lunch buffet. The spread had good number of items but there was nothing memorable. Can give it a miss if you are looking for a spicy indian cuisine.Dishes were more bland and passable at the best.The only saviour are the desserts - kheer and gulab jamu
3
My Sister booked this place for her ROM (marriage) and there were like 25 of us. The place was pretty packed and variety of dishes served in buffet style. This place is known for the tandoori chicken which was pretty good. Other than that the rest of the dishes were quite mediocre. Sometimes this place gets too busy and you don't have the feel of being in such crowded environment as everyone queuing up for food and it can be time consuming. Also I would say the food is on the expensive side. Perhaps if you have a tight Budget i suggest you try elsewhere.One important point although not pertaining to food - what I was very disappointed was the condition of the rest room. In one of the cubicles... UnFlushed. I guess you can throw up and start another round of buffet
4
Delicious and authentic North Indian food- naan, briyani and steamed rice, served with different dishes- including few vegetarian dishes. Meat is obtained from a halal supplier but no Halal certificate is displayed as they serve liquor. Good service.
5
The food is authentic Indian Cuisine and the crew service is so good, fantastic buffet, worth every penny, perfect if you are coming with your friends during the weekends.
4
Hotel by the riverside serving nice Indian food. The taste and ambience is good. Staff is courteous too.
4
I have been visiting Riverwalk Tandoor for more than 10 years.... I have never been disappointed! Good quality is good and very consistent... Staff is very courteous and friendly.
4
Good restaurant with a great variety and selection of Indian buffet dishes. Staff is also very responsive and well trained. Overall a good experience each time visited.
4
Good Indian (Punjabi) food and have both vegetarian and non vegetarian options. Beautiful location and specifically in night looks very good.
3
I have visited riverwalk tandoor twice at clarke quay and once at rangoon road and it doesn't fail to disappoint me in one way or the other. This restaurant has a buffet as well as Ala cart option. It is an above average place for north indian vegetarian food and an average place for non vegetarian and sea food
1
I used to go to River walk tandoor often. Surprisingly this Tuesday i was shocked with their food quality and limited dishes available. The chicken tandoor and chicken was the worst ever and even the butter naan that i used to love in this place was the bad and not tasty at all. The fruit available was only watermelon and none of their waiters take care to replace other fruits. I'm deffinitely not going back at this restaurant again. Very disappointed!!!Dinner 26.01.201
3
Good food and nice service.Company dinner weekend, group of 14 pax. (second time)$24.25 (inclusive of 7% vat & 10% service charge) each.Food was good. I love the freshly baked naan and their papad not so salty (very good to take while drinking).They have promo on mock tails (non-alcoholic mixed drinks) and cocktails, buy 1 get 1.Ambience is nice.Service was very good, waiters are attentive and friendly.I made my booking, I have to say the Philippine girl (sorry forgot the name) was very accommodating and friendly, via phone and in person
4
At the restaurant for dinner tonight Saturday 17 October, 2015. We paid for 38.80 S$ for 2 buffet dinner plus 20$ on red wine and Mango Lassi (good Lassi). The restaurant is a few steps from Jumbo Seafood restaurant. It was easy to find. All staffs were very friendly and attentive. They're always walk by checking on our drinking water and kept refill it. Also take away empty plate and refill foods that get lower. Also brought us a basket of fresh & hot garlic naan right after we settle down at the table. John seem very polite, he walked us to the door after we paid the bill and say thank you. Foods, desserts and fruits choices were limited. Most of foods taste a bit blended but meats quality quite good i.e mutton, chicken and fish. Fruits is good quality with sweet & cold. I'm not familiar with those Indian 2 desserts that provided. For me, it was OK place. For my husband, he wasn't satisfied. It's mean we probably won't be back. Just don't expect too much for this place
4
The atmosphere was nice, location is great. The place is easily accessible by public transport. Food was reasonably good and delicious. Service was nice too and all personnel were amiable. I have been there a couple of times and never had any complaints.
4
This place has a great selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. On the veggie front, the saag paneer was amazing. Overall I really enjoyed it and although I didn't try the desserts I was told that they were fantastic.
4
The place is very much like a restaurant in Mumbai, its crowded as their buffet is very affordable. We did not take the buffet but ordered ala-carte. Food is ok ok.
2
Such great location felt wasted. I entered to have tandoori food, only buffet was available, with lone tandoor item 'chicken tandoor', taste was surely the worst among others. And to be frankly, none of the items could pass an average marking. Price is reasonable.
5
This is simply the best indian restaurant in Singapore. The dishes are always mouthwatering and always varieties are offered on the buffet. I love Tandoori Chicken specially and always ove to come here.
5
Good deal for cocktails ,mocktails and premium wines. Cheerful staff and kind management will fulfill your dinning expectations. Great place to have authentic Indian food.
5
Few days back had been to Riverwalk Tandoor with my family as was recommended by the sales person who explained us over the phone about the lovely cuisine which made us carve for food , he guided us how to get there and also provided us number just in case .... As explained we were treated with excellent taste of India which missed on most other places ..... above all the staff was very much helpful and being a Vegetarian they took proper care even in small thing like spoon. Thanks Team Keep it up !
4
We had buffet lunch at their Farrer Park restaurant. The food was delicious and worth the money (S$16). When I informed the staff that Naan and Tandoori chicken were over, they immediately refilled both and brought a basket of rotis to our table. Overall, a fine dining experience
3
River walk Tandoori has been around for ages. Their well known for their buffet. Their buffet spread usually consist of a veg and non veg starters, a chicken, fish and mutton gravy dish, two vegetarian side dishes, and two desserts, a kheer and a halwa. Naan/roti basket will be served at your table. The food is just average but definitely it's a value for money. It's okay to dine herr once in a while as the buffet dishes are repetitive. Customer service was fine at the river walk outlet
1
Visited this place on 25/4/15 with a group of 30 people. The food is just okay but the behaviour of the restaurant staff with the guests deserve a special mention. The waitresses and receptionist were extraordinarily rude. Did not even spare senior citizens with their rude behaviour. It was like they were feeding free food in a community langar. Go to this place only if you want to get insulted and pay for it. Does not deserve to be in hospitality business
3
Getting a full fledged buffet with this amount is a good deal indeed. The buffet spread had a handsome variety. The best was matar paneer (green peas & cheese) but the rest didn't disappoint either.
5
This is the best place to hace indian buffet in singapura,buffet starts usually at 6.30 evening .
you will enjoy mouthwatering indian menu
4
The lunch spread of indian food was good. The gulab jamun served here was hot and delicious - just bought me back to India for a minute.
5
Best Indian food love the desserts and value for money... Best place for travelers and people who love indian food.
4
Good Indian Food , their Buffet is having good variety . i was there more than 3 times in my two visit to singapore
5
Having eating western food for a few weeks while traveling through Europe, we chose this restaurant to get us back into spice mode, as we had been here a couple of times before on previous visits. we were not disappointed. The food and service is still of good quality. We chose a la carte, rather than the buffet. The waiter brought us out complimentary pappadams and mint chutney to begin with. We shared samosas, chicken biryani, a naan and another chicken curry with capsicum and tomatoes. Everything was delicious. The food bill was around $35, but as we also had wine and beer, that raised the price. All up, including the plus plus tax, with two wines and two beers, the total bill was $83.60. We were very full and didn't eat all the biryani. Would go back again
5
The restaurant location is easy to reach from City Hall MRT station by walking or by bus. The ambiance is pleasing. I seldom eat vegetables however, their vegetables were cooked with the right amount of spices (not overwhelming) eaten with white or briyani rice. Their chicken tandoori was tasty plus their free flow of warm buttered naan bread to go with. The mango lassi tasted so fresh and I suggest to save it for last because it's quite heavy on the belly. Not to mention their desserts. Last but not least, their daily buffet cost is really affordable
4
We had our department dinner at Riverwalk Tandoor. Variety of food was good (gulab was awesome!). A bit strange for the place to be decked out in christmas decorations with christmas songs playing over the speakers, but hey, its christmas so the ambiance was good! Staff was looking moody and serious though. Doesnt hurt to smile a bit more
3
this was our second visit to this restaurant. I would advise sitting outside, or inside for a large group. Not much atmosphere, but good food. The buffet makes it a quick cheap meal, however the range in the buffet was no where near as extensive as last time (a few years ago) at $18.50 is good value though.Little India offers more choices, expensive or cheap eats. Probably wouldn't come here agai
1
the worst indian restaurant ever. It is actually not a restaurant but looks like as if eating and sitting in a marriage hall. No ambience, no interior , bad and slow service and the buffet also not much variety included with cold food. Spent 150 bucks but not worth the value. Waste of money
1
The worst restaurant I have eaten at in Singapore.
The food was late, the beer was warm, the service was awful.
Cannot make a positive recommendation.
1
Ufff....one of the worst Indian food ever and an equally bad service! Though a buffet everything was cold....there was a private party going on at the same time. We had wait for a long time to get the dishes refilled...breads were cold and hard..,just bad!
2
Went there expecting tandoor food but the buffet was just routine fare with not a single tandoor dish. Disappointed. Dull atmosphere in a lively location.
1
I have been to this place a few times but recently the standards have dropped and quality of food has gone down. I visited the Clarke quay outlet last month with family.In short the worst part of the trip to this restaurant is the attitude of the Filipino Manager John ( hope i get his name right ) He is such a arrogant fellow and and has a horrible attitude towards his customers.I could notice his arrogance towards other 2 customers who had some billing queries the way he answers or responds to them seems like he doing some favor to his customers.Will definitely not visit river-walk Tandoor in the future.Just a piece of advice to the so called Manager. There are better restaurants with better service and ambiance in Sg. God bless your attitude and arrogance
3
I've had their lunch buffet a few times over the past 3 odd years. The vegetarian spread is standard - some salad, a raita, papad, plain rice, saffron rice, a dal, three curries, sweet, dessert, and bread (naan/paratha). The Gulab Jamuns have always been delicious - usually, my main motivation for visiting the Riverwalk Tandoor. However, the rest of the food is a completely different story - it's inconsistent at best and terrible at worst - too much oil and food colouring pretty much kills any flavour the curries could have. It also depends on when you get there - around 12:30 - the food is hot and fresh. However, any later than 1:30 and the replacement of food is infrequent and very often, you have to make do with just the oil and gravy! For the standard of food, the buffet is a little over priced
4
We went to the clarke quay outlet few weeks back. We sat outside in the area facing the road in a non-smoking area but it was still close by the river. The ambience was very good and the food was good too. They had vegetable soup, salads, naan, chicken tandoori, chicken kebab, chicken curry, lamb curry and fish curry apart from biriyani and white rice. The veg people will also have equal no of dishes compare to non-veg. I can say that both were balanced. Then they had gulab jamon and rice kheer as deserts. They had fresh fruits and finally winded up with Masal tea. It is really worth for $23 (including tax) for a sat night dinner. A very good place for party/trea
4
It is so nice to get a pleasant surprise. The restaurant does not look that flash but the food is superb and the staff very friendly. The food was so good we have just returned from our second visit and still very happy.Highly recommend both the a la carte menu as well as the buffet
4
We visited Riverwalk Tandoor with a Deal.com deal and had a really good meal. The deal saved a couple dollars on the regular buffet price (which is reasonable at normal prices). There were several veggie curries, one lamb, one chicken and tandoori chicken. All were hot fresh and regularly refilled. The great addition to he normal buffet is that they provide regular baskets of freshly cooked naan (and refill it if you want them to). My only problem was that I ate too much (my issue not the restaurant's)
4
I went to Riverwalk Tandoor in June 2007 with my family for dinner during our visit in singapore. Excellent food with authentic Indian flavour in Singapore. The food quality is good and we like it a lot. Highly recommend this place for first timers and for Indian food lovers
1
I along with my friend has gone for a Dinner at RWT , hoping to have some good North Indian food . I was totally Disappointed with their service and the attitude of the staff at RWT . One of their staff came over and told us in a cold tone that they would be closing the buffet by 10.40pm ,while we were in the middle of our Dinner another waiter came and told us to pay the bill as their cash counter was closing . I was appalled at the attitude of the staff.The Absolute lack of service and unprofessional approach really offended me and my friend. I asked for the Manger of the restaurant, was told the Mr. Nagaraj had left for the day. I asked for a feedback form or complaint register and was informed that they did not have one .In the meanwhile, the other staff at RWT also started having dinner next to our table. It looked that the entire staff was in a hurry to close the restaurant and go home, even though it was not even 11.00pm by then .On checking who was the next in charge a guy called John came forward who also was the cashier and looked to be in equally hurry to close for the day. He also said they did not have a feedback form or a register for customer feedback.My Receipt No: 00010354 Dt 10-01-14 is of time 22.04, which says that even when we had not finished our meals and completed the order the Bill had been prepared.If any of the top management of RWT is reading this, you better need to be taking ASAP corrective action, as word of mouth in todayâ€™s digital world spreads quite fast and would be difficult to recover the lost reputation . It seriously needs some personnel attention of the top guys at RWT to figure out why their Sales are dropping specially during EVENING time . You have enough competition at Boat Quay with lot of other Indian Restaurants offering a much better service.My feedback to the management is to take corrective action before its too late .Atu
5
I went to Riverwalk Tandoor in Clarke Quay with my friends. Can get buffet as well for both veg and non-veg options. The food quality is good and we like it a lot. There are not much of vegetarian options. But the buffet is good.
4
A place to get good Indian tandoori chicken. North Indian dishes are good, need to see improvement with some south styled dishes.
Overall the menu is good.
5
Excellent food with authentic Indian flavour after home in Singapore!!
Totally sinful if you miss Butter paneer, Naan, Pulao, Butter chicken and last but not the least Dal Makhani. Total value for money
4
nice indian food...specialy that chaat is amazing which u can prepared ur self....staff is very good and helpful... had great time....will come again for sure.
Its situated on the 5th floor of landmark village hotel in bugis area....step away from Arab Street
3
Disappointed with the quality of food and the ambiance. Very cramped seating and average music.Tandoori Chicken was good. The rest was average. Fish was smelly. Fruit custard was one of the worst I have tasted. Spread as such was not great.Service though was good. +1 for that
1
I went to this place in Clark quay and was suggested by a friend, but believe me the food is bad. There was nothing quite edible.. the chicken was old, the fish smelly and old and the mutton was horrible.. I then tried the vegetarian section but even that did not taste .. actually no taste.. the sweet dish had powdered milk I guess .. because it tasted horrible and even the curd.. I was stunned to find horrible curd. as curd can be better. The only thing edible was the cut fruits.. I wasted a nice evening and 50 dollars for sad food and even sadder ambience.. Felt like some Indian rural wedding with loud sad music and just no elegance.. Even if we go there for only food and no ambience.. its is sad... Please eat some biscuits and chips and don't waste your money there! It was a Friday evening.It was the saddest place till now
2
If you are looking for quantity and not quality, pl go for it.My exp. - Tandoori Chicken - COLD N DRYRice - ColdDaal - COLD N WATERY LIKE GUJRATI DAAL WITHOUT tarka ( blend of spices )Cauliflower - Totally BLAND AND COLD. Tasteless,my fav. dish.Chicken curry -COLDAt 12, 30 pm , prime lunch time - how could everything be cold . Precooked from fridge ????The Indian Lady working there seem to be immune to what was being served.Two tourist buses came. Guess food is cooked with tourists in mind. ZERO authenicity.Nan was hot and fresh
5
Wonderful upscale buffet. How can it be upscale, check it out . Reasonable prices without having to sacrifice quality or quantity of food. Service was amazing. Lassi is a must try. Naan was hot and tasteful. Highly recommend this place for first timers and for Indian food lovers
4
Its the best service i can get even comparing it with hotel chains like Parkroyal's Chatz or Marriott's Wan Hao or Shook. The staff were young, probably students but they go all out with smiles and extended their hospitality to you with lots of actions and queries on what you need and what you do not need. They were always in smiles and awaiting your order and its like "Your wish is my command". Even when the coach drops a load of tourists from middle east coming into the restaurant and flooding it, they were still attentive to our needs.They served an assortment of mains. Tandoori Chicken, Some dhwa---- something chicken (I don't really like that one), fish korma, Mutton curry, Saffron rice and many other sides. They were al pretty good. The dissapointment in this buffet is that they were not spicy enough, and i guess the restaurant owner is forced to make it so unauthentic to cater to tourists' demands and taste, it will be good if it were spicier. Naans are order to be make and the garlic one was so impressive that i almost forgotten how prata tastes like.We did ordered a butter chicken, to me it was a dissapointment. In comparison to Mothi Mahal Sweets in southall london, that was the best butter chicken i tasted in my life. It melts in the mouth and its softer and more tender. Whereas Riverwalk tandoor version was rubbery and hard to swallow.One of the greatest service i have seen, pretty good food as well. For a price of 18.90++ for dinner buffet, its a must try
4
I have been to this restaurant for a couple of times, one with my partner and the other with my colleagues and both the times we had an excellent buffet dinner. The food was tasty, ambience excellent and good choice of drinks making the dinner an enjoyable one. Looking forward for another visit pretty soon
4
Spricy Punjabi restaurant, with good varieties of Punjabi cuisine. We enjoyed our dinner, with chilled beer, sitting close to the river. Service is good. Decently priced menu. Nice ambience and tasty Punjabi food.
1
The service was really bad... the food quality was not at all good... with rush during the morning breakfast many things goes out of stock and the replenishment is done in leisure. Heating arrangement of the buffet was bad.
5
I went to this restaurant after four years with family. The food is GREAT and the prices are really good. It has buffet system that gives you plenty of choice. The staff and service was great. Best Indian food in Singapore.

Very few Indian restaurents in Singapore offer buffet service, so I was shocked to see the place. Being a food lover, I immediately entered the place. The taste of the food is good, and I noticed that they did not put too much of spices in their food to accomodate the indian, yet kept the original taste. Service is good, but the buffet offers for a selected time you may expect rush and sometime the refilling of buffet items are good. Over all its value for money as you get to eat as much as you can

I walked the Riverside of Singapore looking for a nice restaurant. Actually, I had one in mind, but could not find it, but then I saw Riverwalk Tandoori and the buffet setup inside.This was a nice buffet with a very standard setup. The tastes are accommodated to a non-indian audience - not very spicy but fine. The cot of the buffet S$ 22 is good, and the choices are good.The service is impeccable - you don't wait long for attention.The food quality is good - good variation and great tastes of dishes with the Indian spices of coriander, cumin, mint and ginger.Good experience

We found this little gem on our last day in Singapore and decided to try the 16SD lunch buffet and it was fabulous with a choice of starters,soup, salads ,popadoms and dips. For main courses there was a choice of tandoori chicken and lamb curry ,fish curry and different daahls and rices. The naan bread was frshly cooked and served piping hot at the table-it was superb.Service was second to none-friendly and helpful. For dessert there was a choice of indian puddings and also fresh pineapple,papaya and melon-delicious. Our only regret was that we did not find it sooner

I'm not gonna lie and say this is the best Indian food I have ever had and it's not the best I have had in Singapore, however it is a very good place to go if you want a quick Indian lunch. I went today with a couple of friends as one of them had been numerous times and recommended it. The air-conditioning is on incredibly high making the restaurant very cold and cooling down the buffet food very quickly, however it has no effect on the flavour and the food is delicious. Very good, friendly service as well. Would definitely recommend if you are in that area at lunch time

My family and I thoroughly enjoyed their lunch buffet at their outlet at Farrer Park. The atmosphere is authentic North Indian. The food was sumptuous and appetizing. The options were plenty with vegetarians, chicken and fish. The dessert were to-die-for (especially the gulab) and the price down-to-earth, Service staff very professional. Definitely, an eating outlet worthy of your consideration

I was at the Upper Circular restaurant with my wife and mother-in-law and I was greeted by a very smiley gentleman, who helped us to a table outside. I liked the ambience coz it wasn't too crowded. We had buffet and ordered some a-la-carte dishes.. I really really enjoyed the food. The manager I spoke to said they have been around since 1998! There were a handful of western tourists sitting outside probably from the nearby Clarke Quay area. Other than that, a handful of office executives sitting inside. Food was excellent and service was acceptable. I'll be convincing my whole office to dine there soon

Cheap as chips, we (3 pax) Singapore Dollars S$ 66.00 went for the buffet but then it was ALL vegetarian except for a goat mutton curry.Naan bread, pratha, chapatis were great, biniani rice okay a bit dry, overall the vegetarian dahls and curries were okay lah, but disappointed that sadly no tandoor dishes available on the buffet so I found the whole concept rather misleading.Beverage service poor, ordered a lime soad that never came.......The Coffee was atrocious ( powdered instant stuff) from a jar and condensed milk.Quite a lot of mosquitos lurking under the table...they had no spray so alot of leg slapping under the table and I came a way with some numungous red bites.Would not bother going back as Im not a huge vegetarian fan

We have been here 4 times and in our opinion do not try unless you are going for the buffet, the food will take forever to arrive and the service is fine unless you complain and things turn frosty.

The restaurant is conveniently located close to the Clarke Quay MRT stop, and has a good spread during the lunch and dinnner buffets. Plenty of choices for both veg/non-vegetarians.

Very good buffet, especially the north Indian varieties in it. Good value for money. Personally, I have found the food quallity at their Riverwalk (near Clarke Quay) outlet better than the Farrer Park (Little India) outlet.

During our recent visit to Singapore, we were offered meal vouchers for Riverwalk Tandoor. The experience was very enjoyable. Good food, clean and neat, good service.

I have been to this restaurant thrice and I keep visiting because the buffet spread is really good value for money(never tried the ala carte).The fish tikka or chilly fish or whatever fish starters they have are one of the best that I have had anywhere. The mutton preparation is indifferent,as it has been twice good and once not so much. The gulab jamoons for desert are also succulent.Unfortunately, the tandoori chicken which should be their signature dish, going by their name, is always pretty bad and should definitely be improved upon.By bad, I mean , it often goes cold, and is not juicy enough. No veg starters though, which is a pity, Some pakodas/samosas would definitely improve the value

I went to this restaurants for a cousin's birthday. A waiter banged right into meas I was getting out of my seat and caused great damage to my glasses. I had to have them sent for repair and in fact if I had not been wearing glasses, would have sustained injury to my eye. When I called up the management of Riverwalk tandoor to report of this incident, it took them almost a week to get back to citing various different excuses. The best part of it all was that they said that it was not the waiters' fault although they had acknowledged that he had only been working for them for 2 months. There was no apologies from the management either. Please avoid t his restaurant especially if you wish not to get injured

When we go to little india we always have food at Murugan Idli or Copper Chimney, last week it was raining and we saw this restaurant laying their buffet fresh while nr Ferrer Park MRT exit A - we decided to chk for their buffet dinner cost and it was under 10$ for a huge spread of veg+non-veg items, we instantly decided to give it a shot and were truly impressed by the menu selection which included starters, maincourse with your choice of naan or roti made upon order and good desserts... each item was very tasty and considering we paid around 20$ for 2 pax for a good dinner spread was really value for mone

The buffet has not so many varieties. It does not get replenished quickly, so sometimes you will find nothing in the pan. I feel that there are more vegetarian dishes compared to the meat options. The taste is nothing special. I have better Indian foods elsewhere in Singapore.I would prefer to go somewhere else that serves a la carte. The value for the food will be better

We were not adepts of Indian kitchen. But we enjoyed so much in this restaurant, that we managed to revisited it several times during our 1 week Singapore visit. The buffet was really delicious. There are some places outdoor, next to the pool with a nice view on skyscrapers
