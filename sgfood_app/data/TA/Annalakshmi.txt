This is a special restaurant you pay as you please after you eat to makes it a very interesting concept . I used to be regular when I worked in China town it’s a place for any vegetarian who likes South Indian cuisine .
5
First time experience such "pay as you wish after my meal". Buffet vegetrian foods, delicious. Must have masala tea. Good service, comfortable seating and ambience.
Simple and delicious lunch with my family.
Love the place.

I was taken there for lunch as it was convenient to the office I was visiting. I had read about this restaurant and was interested to experience it. The waiters are volunteers and were very capable. The food was enjoyable and the choice quite good.

If you are looking for Veg food in Singapore , do not miss this one. Buffet menu good choice , food with excellent taste . Good Ambience as well and friendly staff.
5
In my opinion, No other indian restaurants in Singapore gave the immense food satisfaction as Anna Laxmi does. One can find food is being offered rather than just served. This is one of the Pay-as - you-want type of restaurant. Must book in advance to avoid disappointments. They close around 9.30 pm. This restauran delivers food via UberEats as well.
5
This is a must visit place if you like Indian friends food. Place is run by charity so you pay what you want to pay, there is no price on food.Most of the days it offer buffet with both north Indian and south Indian food options.You will be surprised by how simple and tasty food
5
Probably the best food deal in Singapore! Delicious food, vegetarian and nice ambiance and the greatest thing ever you have to pay only on offer, you don’t have a menu. The fresh fried bread and sauces were amazingly tasty! Will love to go back every day :) 5 stars fully deserved! Great job family:

My brother had told me about this Restaurant for Vegetarian food. I got an opportunity to visit it on my last day. Its a place run for Charitable Cause . Food, People, Vibes, Ambience , Location ( which I realised on my last day) everything was good about this Restaurant. If you are a Vegetarian and Like South Indian Food, this is one of the best places to be. But check their timing beforehand, they are strict about timing and entry closes half an hour before the actual closing time
5
I stumbled onto Annalakshmi on a 1992 visit to Singapore and loved it from the start – extraordinarily good food and great vibe. Since, I've visited the Perth location and loved that, too. Revisiting the very hard to find Singapore location more than 25 years later I found that the buffet is still remarkable but the vibe was off. The insistence on reservations even for a solo diner when the place was empty was disconcerting, and the greeter was downright unfriendly – the exact opposite of my previous experience. Still, the food was wonderful as before
4
After having an excellent buffet I was surprized when informed I can pay what I feel like - something that I had heard of though was not sure if I had just entered the same restaurant - staff was welcoming and courteous. Good spread of home made like food.
5
My friend took us there for a pure Indian Vegetarian meal, and we were not disappointed. The food was delicious and plenty of it, buffet style.
5
What a find! This restaurant provides a buffet full of Indian food, with the 'menu' changing daily. The night I visited I had soups, daal, curries, rice, naan and a small dessert. All delicious and tasted authentic. Service was fine but not stellar.
5
Buffet food - rice, sambar, rasam, curry and koottu! Option of bread and dal too. For a change., you get to taste butter milk also . Decent food and variety. You are supposed to pay what you feel as this is meant for noble cause ! So request you pay the rightful !!! It is near PWC - Cross street.
5
Eat the buffet and pay as you like is the policy they follow. This place is worth a visit. The food is simple, not very spicy and easy on your tummy. During navratras they had stalls outside their restaurant which offered a variety of Indian food. The restaurant is pure veg. Do try their mango Lassi. Even after coming back to India me and my friends are missing the food by annlakshmi. They have a buffet spread for lunch and dinners which usually has potato veggie, mix veggies rice dal sambhar puri or nan. The buffet spread is not massive and limited to 2 veggies, 1 lentil curry, curd or raita, papad and some simple sweet dish. I did not enjoy the sweetdish and naan, I found the naan a little thick. But the rest of the food was good and easy to digest. I shall surely visit again. They serve you with a smile. Mondays dinner is off. Since they are doing a charity by serving food and you can pay at you own will, pls make sure you pay them what they deserve as they are happy to serve. Will visit again :) great job #annalakshm
5
Great place to have the unlimited pure vegetarian taste of india in singapore without the worry to spend a penny. Eat as much you like & pay as you like. No worries. No questions. No need to bother for any currency conversion. Hats off to anna lakshmi for such a noble cause to deliver the taste of india for free
5
Annalakshmi provides a good spread of Indian vegetarian food in its buffet. The ambience is ethnic and authentic too. Management and service is provided by volunteers who are more than helpful to guests who are non-Indians. Liked the variety and courteous service Price is reasonable and again you can pay as you wish with no compulsion
5
I have visited this restaurant numerous times for dinner (as well as the one in the city for lunch) - by myself, with my family, or with friends. I have never been disappointed with the quality of food. It is always on my list whenever I visit Singapore.The place is unassumingly, but tastefully, decorated. The highlight, of course, is the food. It is not a typical south or north Indian meal. It has elements of both. But all the dishes are prepared with moderate spice and no grease. That makes it a pleasure on the palette and the stomach.The dinner buffet comes with a drink. You can pay as much as you wish (although please try to be generous!)This restaurant is a "must visit" for any vegetarian. The food is perfect for an international audience, not just Indian
5
For a fine and delicious Indian vegetarian meal, this restaurant offers plenty. I have had on two occasions walked into this restaurant without a reservation and thankfully was not turned away. In fact, the lunchtime crowd started coming in shortly after we sat and soon, most of the tables were taken.The wait staff asked if we wanted drinks and even made recommendations. Otherwise, plain water was served. The food was laid out on a buffet table and one helped oneself to the choice dishes. The usual vegetarian dishes, such as lentils, chickpeas, potatoes, etc., are found in this spread and you are able to have more than one serving.At the end, your kindly donations are much appreciated and your meal is paid off at the counter at the entrance of the restaurant. No questions are asked but you pay as you deem fit.
5
We are used to Annalakshmi in India and in Malaysia. In both these places, while the food is good, the din by the patrons is a bit high.However, Annalakshmi in Singapore was found to be pleasantly different. Though patronised more by South Asians, especially South Indians, the place had just a conversational buzz.The food was very good and the spread optimum!As many other patrons would have experienced, Annalakshmi does not have pre-fixed prices for their food items and encourage the guests to pay as they please and what they think the fare is worth.We had good hot food from the buffet, ably assisted by the maitre-de-hotel and the waiters.All are served with utmost courtesy, leaving pleasant memories of the place
2
'Eat what you want & Pay as you like' doesn't entitle you to behave rudely with your customers. The food was ok, but the staff really need some lessons on customer service. It was showing off that their heart was not into the charity work they are doing. Even after paying well for the food, the person at the Cash counter asked me how many lunch plate we took and looked at me as if I was paying peanuts. This attitude doesn't align to what you are preaching about this restaurant.
5
Completely vegetarian restaurant with a unique concept.
We reached in time for their buffet. The food was delicious. Very authentic.
The ladies who cook, also serve and with so much love!
You pay as much as you want.
Very homely.
5
I was accompanied by friends family here for dinner buffet, food was very good , cleanliness was excellent, onec of the best places to have Indian vegetarian food.
Restaurant works on charity concept all persons serving cooking are volunteers as I was informed.
5
Love this place is pay as you wish and has a Wide variety if vegetarian South Indian dishes . Good place to get someone craving for Indian food in singapore especially the vegetarian. The menu changes Everyday and the variety is superb .
5
I am visiting from Switzerland with wife and two kids. Every time we come to Singapore we make sure we at least have a meal at Annalakshmi. When traveling with kids, it's always a question you ask yourselves if you want to go for a buffet as the kids don't eat much and you land up paying for them as well. The concept here is great "eat as much as you can and pay as mush as you want". The food here is sooooo good sometimes reminds me of my moms cooking. The dinning here is mostly a buffet with a wide variety of items from both north and South Indian incl. starters and some sweets/dessert. You can also order lassi and filter coffees. The whole place is run by volunteers (unpaid) and the service you get is marvelous. The proceeds from what you pay goes to charities. This place has been a reference/benchmark for me when I visit any restaurants both in Singapore and as well abroad. I sometimes think I should bring this concept back to Switzerland. Final verdict, a must visit for everyone visiting or living in Singapore not just for Indians but also foreigners wanting to try Indian food with a different concept.

I happen to meet a group of Vegans and I suggested going to this Restaurant at Central Square. These friends were really enthralled by the Beauty of this restaurant and some artifacts and curious for sale. The food was really salivaiuos and was enjoyed by these friends from overseas. There is no price tagged to the food and you can pay anything you like for the food. The staff there are all volunteers and are not paid a salary but the service given by them are many times better than any other restaurants. The crew are all followers of Swami Shanthananda. Next door you will classrooms where music is taught. I will anytime recommend people who love vegan food to this restaurant
5
When you enter the restaurant, the feeling itself is so divine..They serve food with so much love and the food here is so tasty and It is as good as home made food! The concept is eat as much as you can and pay how much ever you want. Along with the sambar, rasam, they serve 2 sabjis, naan, appam, 2 drinks, rice and pongal/biryani. I think one must go here at least once for this experience
4
overall good experience, food quality , hygiene, service etc. up to the mark and also u pay as u like, there is no fixed price for anything. The old guy (i think manager) at reception was weird, snobbish and rude, except him rest everything was OK. Don't forger to book your table in advance
5
AMAZING! I went to this place immediately after finding out about them, didn't make a reservation, showed up at the door and was still welcomed. I went there by myself, so the turnaround was super fast, 20 minutes I was done. I wish I could sit there a bit longer to eat more, but since it was already late for me to eat (7 pm), and I didn't have anyone to share conversations with, I finished quickly. I will DEFINITELY come back for more! The food was so fresh and tasty, cooked with love! The volunteers were serving with love, I cannot praise this place enough
4
This is a delight to the traveller who is looking for some home cooked South Indian fare. The restaurant works on a community service concept and meals are cooked by patrons who provide their services. Diners can pay any suitable amount for the food they consume. While the food is very basic, it's also a boon to some who are in nee

We were in Singapore last week and were searching for a good Vegetarian outlet as we all are pure vegetarian. We came to know about “Ännalaxmi”, searching through the map we reached there. It was a pure south Indian restaurant with a buffet laid. We were amazed to see the same in Singapore. We asked what the buffet price are and were told by the owner that whatever you feel like. We thought we didn’t heard it right and asked again. But to our surprise it was correct. It’s a chain of nonprofit organization and their concept is like whatever you think is the right price according to your will you can pay. All the family members of the owner were serving in the restaurant and the food was yummy. From starters to main course, fresh cut fruits to desert, you have a whole lot of choice in the buffet. Above that the concept of serving to people and pay what you feel is fair price was amazing. It starts from 11 am to 3 PM and then 7 PM to 10 PM what I remember. Thank you everyone for such a lovely meal and keep up the good work
5
This restaurant's decor could challenge any other upscale south indian restaurant. I was surprised to see that it was following pay as much as you want concept. The buffet meal is the closest to home food you can get in Singapore
4
Indian vegetarian buffet without a fixed price. You pay what you feel is right. Most clients are Indian. We loved what we ate. Now also available by Uber.
5
An excitement for the senses !
Great venue
Great service
Must visit
Must try whatever in the menu , you won't get disposable
Value for money
A restaurant museum /at gallery !!
4
Well it's really great food there and you can eat anything .and there is no any price it's up to people how much they want to pay .I really like food coz I'm low budget traveller .so it's good for me that in low price I get much service and food
5
I went this place with my friends, really we liked tasty food and good buffet, In track service also very good.. Staff was pouring juice, lassi and water time to time. Buffet price was not fixed it's depended on us what we ate and what we liked And how much we wanted to pay.. Like temple.. Or good standard of restaurant.. Good job to full staff
5
Perfect dinner I would say! Took my wife for dinner on valentines day. Reserved our seats early to avoid any awful situation. It is a gallery of paintings and Hindu God statues than a restaurant. Mesmerising instrumentals were played in the background at a perfect volume. And the food was delicious with no unwanted oil or spices. We were looked after very well by the staff. It was a perfect dinner i would concludeThank you
5
Annalakshmi, Havelock Road, Singapore. What a beautifully unbelievable idea... eat what you want, pay what you want. Amazingly tasty Indian food, a well-stocked buffet, waiters who are ordinary citizens like you and me volunteering their service, all proceeds go to running an Indian classical music and dance school next door and other charities. If you ever go to Singapore, eat at one of the Annalakshmis. You will always treasure the experience. An unexpected bonus: The Holiday Inn express is just a 5-minute walk away from this exquisite place
5
A friend took me here and this cozy and beautiful place is a gem i would not have found without local help. The food is great and i went there on a all you caneat then pay what you can buffet day (not sure if it is common) but i highly recommend it. The tastes are great and there is a lot to choose from.
5
One of the best vegetarian indian restaurants in Singapore. Charity run non-profit restaurant. Pay as you like. I was there for lunch. Volunteers (not staff) guided me to the table. Buffet has different breads on each day. On my visit, it was chapati. Buffet spread had decent varieties of homely Indian food - plain rice, variety rice, sambar, rasam, dal, aloo gobi, mixed vegetables, curd, pickle, sweet & spiced buttermilk
5
It was our second day in Singapore and were searching for Indian vegetarian food. We came across Annalakshmi and were really delighted to find real Indian food in the middle of Singapore with very homely treatment. The food was homely and the people serving and attending were very polite and courteous. For an hour there we almost forgot that we were in a foriegn land.
4
Very tasty & yummy South Indian food at very nominal price..
Must try if you are in Singapore..don't miss it..
5
If you are traveling to Singapore with your family for more than 3 days, your itinerary must include a visit to this restaurant. It has awesome food, amazing hospitality, and great ambiance.
Nothing can beat a satvik Hindu food.
2
Like the other reviewer said the service is extremely rude. If you walk-in without reservation there is a lady who advises you in her rude voice. The food is just ok and not great.
4
Very nice dining experience. Simple and tasty vegetarian food. Nice ambiance. Buffet dinner. Taste was good. Can pay as you like. Money goes towards promoting Indian dance and music. Unique concept. Liked it!!!!!!
4
At a price that you decide as it really depends on how much you enjoyed it. It is a small restaurant and serves authentic Indian vegetarian food as a buffet. No alcohol. Loved the concept and the food and simple ambiance.
5
My husband loved eating indian food so this was the best place in singapore to get decent indian food !
4
A pure vegetarian restaurant is a treat for foodies and those who look for Indian food with homely taste. It serves a buffet that consists of appetisers, main course, soups, sides, fruits and desserts. Go when you are super hungry so you can stuff yourself with everything available ;-) Tip: Reserve in advance, or wait in a long queue outside. - Place is walkable from ClarkQuay MRT
1
We visited Annalakshmi at Havelock road on Saturday (5th Nov) and it was really a very disappointing experience. It was around 6 plus in the evening and the place was very empty with less than 6 people dining in. My husband and i walked in and was asked if we had a reservation and we said no. So the guy at the counter advised us politely that it was better to make a reservation the next time round and he can show us our seat. All was going fine till a lady staff came up to the counter and started very rudely about how we need to make a reservation before we come and that if there is no reservation, we may not be able to get a seat. Her tone was extremely loud and rude. After this drama, she offered to give us a seat. Naturally we were offended and humiliated, rejected her offer and left the place. No doubt Annalakshmi started with a noble intent but it seems that the service has gotten worst over time. Terrible attitude
4
This is quite a different hotel, where in you need to book a table before coming and can eat buffet pure veg food and pay as much as you want to. The cleanliness is of the highest levels. Also the staff is extremely decent and educated. Definitely worth visiting. And the ambience is also class apart
5
Why this restaurant is different?Concept is " Eat how much u can, Pay what ever you feel ." Restaurant dÃ©cor is good,lighting, music is good.More than that food is just excellent.Vegetarian, south Indian/ north Indian/ lassi / juices Taste is superb.Staff so polite, & service is good.Don't miss this place 
4
Vegetarian food never tasted so good! Really worth going with friends and family, very good environment to sit down and eat and chat. Buffet style and pay what you want.
5
A very good place for Indian food. They serve South as well as North Indian dishes. You can eat as much as you wish and pay whatever you feel is right. Food and service, both were great.
There can be a long queue though.
5
Very good quality, tasty and wide variety of food. Very nice ambient. Best place to have vegetarian food.
3
This is a very simple buffet spread but it is very tasty and good value as you determine the price you wish to pay. The BlackBerry lassi was a little strange but overall very enjoyable.
3
Simple and decent vegetarian dishes. Service was quick and polite. I like the concept of eat and pay as you wish. This wasn't my first visit to Annalakshmi. I recalled there were more dishes to select from when Annalakshimi was located at Chinatown Square.
1
Being Ganesha festival, we thought of having traditional indian food at Annalakshmi as we were tired after long work hours.It was a bad decision. As soon as we started the food, the lady with green saree who was serving Appams asked us not to take too much curry. We were embarrassed to hear that. It was our first serving and we had just one appam on the plate. People should have minimum courtesy what to talk when serving food. It's meant to be buffet & not sure how someone can boss around saying don't take food!Just want to add that other than this lady service from all others were ok. Just saying something insensitive like this,this lady ruined our day and killed our appetite before starting our meal
4
Food here is good. You get to eat as much as you like, and their charging concept is "pay as you wish". Because the food and service is good I always pay generously but I don't think they judge. It is an amazing concept. Place is always full, to the extent where you will have to wait in queue outside. But once seated it is a worthwhile experienc
3
Nice place for a relaxed meal. Attentive staff. Avoid weekends as the place gets too crowded. Curry leaf rice and cooked potato were good. Chakra Pongal tasted yum. Plain naan and Pulav was good too. There was no tea of coffee; so buttermilk was served. It was a pleasant experience overall. Worth a try
1
The buffet spread offered is not the best available in Singapore although credits need to be given to the ambiance setup. However, this ambiance comes disguised in horrible customer service by the staff/ volunteers at this outlet. The last time round me and my friends visited this place, when we pulled an extra chair after enquiring with one of the volunteers, the lady in charge at the counter insulted us by asking us if we were eating at a hawker center that we pull extra chairs in without asking anyone about this. Well int his case we did ask one of the volunteers if it was ok to pull this extra chair and the lad in charge could have asked us politely to not move chairs. During my previous visits I have received stares from several of their volunteers and this is not a very welcoming experience. I hope they take into consideration that food needs to be served with a smile to anyone who visits the outlet regardless of class/ creed
5
This is a unique restaurant which i call 360 degree buffet. That means how much you can eat and how much you can pay. They do not price the food. You can just pay as much as you want. Service is very good. They usually have a wide spread of variety of food. It covers naan, Tomato Rice, Pualo, Rasam, At least 5-6 types if different vegetables coked in indian style, Pakoras, papad, deserts etc. A very good ambient with classical music in the background
5
Runs on the concept eat as much as you wish and pay as much as you wish... They never say a price! Excellent service and nice Indian food. Run by volunteers who are professionals.
4
Good ambiance with INDIAN mythology
Good place to go with family.
Great hosting.
Buffet with many food options.
No price tag. Eat as much as you want and pay as much as you wish.
5
We have visited this place twice , A best vegetarian dishes served as buffet with unique payment mechanism.
5
We arrived at this restaurant on a recommendation as my colleague is vegetarian.The decor of the restaurant is as impressive as it is interesting. On arrival I did not get the impression as other reviewers have reported of sour waiting staff. We were greeted and shown to a table.The food is good. There was a selection of soups, yoghurt drink, two different rices, about five dishes and naan bread and the crispy indian cracker things. For desert I indulged with a small sweet treat.The staff did not have the hovering, always present style about them but they were there when we needed them to order drinks. I felt welcome and appreciated.On leaving I took a photo of the entrance and took a note of the location to ensure that I can return next time I'm in Singapore. A nice place for a quick business lunch
4
This restaurant runs in a concept that eat as much as you like and pay as much as you wish. I was skeptical of the quality and service before turning up at a restaurant with this model. I was pleasantly surprised with the attitude of the staff, the quality of food & neat ambience. While leaving the restaurant, I enquired the cashier how much would they like to charge. The cashier politely declined answering the question and said please contribute to what you think is worth for the food
5
Awesom food with south indian and north indian meal with one drink and at last with a unique mechanism of payment , i never saw such a concept of payment the tender said u may pay whatever u like and according to your satisfaction with regards to meal served ..
2
First of all this place is no comparison to the Chennai restaurant in terms of ambiance quality of food...service standards and the buffet variety. ....we were 10 of us and when we made the booking over phone they said it would cost 15 sing dollars per person which was very nominal and actually I was mentally prepared for 20 to 25 dollars per person.....But because this restaurant is run for charity purpose it does not mean that the staff show that attitude of their face...the furniture was old banquet chairs....stinking table cloth....no air-conditioning. ...no mineral water even if u wanna buy.....very small buffet...there was rasam ,sambar, rice, Dall ,mix veg curry,roti,pulav,raita and cut watermelon. Roti never came till the end....not once was anybody bothered to come to our table asking if we were ok.....absolutely deplorable service....food quality was very average and most importantly the attitude was evident that it was run for charity and made it look like a favour....very very low in comparison to their Chennai annalkshmi. ...will never want to recommend to anyon
4
This was an unexpected find in a modern courtyard near Holiday inn express. South Indian veggie food buffet. The food was good, though not great, and the restaurant itself is interesting. All modern and clean (air con).It's connected to a temple, I believe, and you pay what you want. I felt $10 for a buffet was fair enough (including a fruit drink).I will be going back
5
This restaurant is run by trust and offers wide variety of Indian vegetarian food. Mostly South Indian but North Indian food is also available. Located in centre near clarke quay on Havelok road this restaurant is unique. You dont have rates in menu card. It is your wish how much you want to pay or not. People take full meal with starters and deserts and pay $10 per person or sometimes less. But looking at quality they maintain it is much worth than what people pay. Some generous and geniun people pay what it worth. If you are Indian vegetarian lover then must try at least once
3
One of a kind restaurant that is seen outside india. Though this kinda places are found in India but not in such a costlier city! This is vegetarian buffet spread and one pays whatever one feel like while leaving. The MRTs near to the place are Clarke Quay or Chinatown.Need to reserve your booking before you visit the place and make sure you are on time or risk table not being offered. The ambience is quite nice without the typical Singapore kopitiam odours. There were soup, 2 flavours of rice, 2/3 curries, dal, sambhar, poriyal, desserts, paniyaram, papad. The food was okayish and this might not be the right place if you are looking out for 'restaurant' food. They even offer a drink/juice to go along with your food.Don't mistook the people working there, they are volunteers so be a little considerate :
5
You get to experience simple and authentic south indian food in comfort setting that makes you feel like you are at home. You pay as you wish. Yes, it is free and you can choose not to pay as well.
5
We were struggling to find a restaurant close by in the midst of a storm and came upon this Temple. The food is homemade and donated by volunteers, but anyone can go in to eat. The food was delicious and was served in buffet style so we could choose the dishes that appealed. Waiters were also volunteers but they were quick to help us with drinks and get us settled. No alcohol is served and the temple was appropriately decorated; there was an air of peace and tranquility inside. Payment was by donation so we were generous to assist in upkeep and continuity
5
Believing such a concept exist in todayâ€™s world and that too at a place like Singapore where rentals are so high, is challenging. You pay as you feel. There is no fixed price, and you can pay whatever you want though a decent amount should be donated just because concepts like this should remain viable. Annalakshmi welcomes you to majestic vegetarian food behind beautifully carved wooden doors - traditional Indian, not just the door but whole interior is decorated with contemporary Indian artifacts.We have here many times, some times with office team at lunch, family dinner and also with friends on weekends dinner outing.Never a dull moment. When you bite the food, you can feel the love and warmth it is made and served with. Buffet has good enough spread - soup, pakodas, two or three types of rice, curry, puri or chapati, papad, salad, chutneys, sweets and cut fruits. You can order juice, butter milk or lassi and it is served on table. Mango lassi is so refreshing, I fall in love with the place everytime I have go there.I always end up overeating but the heart craves for more. As for the pay, we normally pay $ 12 avg per adult and round it off depending on how many of us are there. You would generally want to pay higher for the food and ambience and most importantly the feel you get while eating
5
Different experience of Indian taste ,wow you have real Indian taste and class in every bit of the place and food also the best service I wouldn't see in a place that lets us pay any amount we think is best. Annalakshmi was an amazing place to dine. All the best, hope to visit u again
5
Going after many years, I still found the concept of charity restaurant and it's execution spot on. Food was good.. The service was good too... The ambience will remain with me for a long time.. Given that it is run for charity it is quite amazing how they have managed to keep the standards high.Overall it is an experience going there which you ll cherish. Note: it got a bit tricky while paying as we didn't know what a fair amount would be. But then we decided to stick to HK standards and pay.
4
I was firstly surprised to know that there existed a restaurant in the middle of Singapore which served Food in return of whatever amount of their courtesy you would like to pay. Yes, no price tags and a very good south Indian buffet food. I personally like South Indian food and the food was decent enough in the middle of Singapore craving for good homemade quality Indian food. The ambiance is neat and clean and you would find it full with mostly Indians around you. The people serving the food were very gentle. They also serve drinks - I loved the taste of pineapple ginger drink! At the end of the dinner, you can pay the amount at the counter. Although I have heard if you pay very less, the lady at the reception would give you a grumpy look - personally I believe you would end up paying good for the food they serve
5
I visited their restaurant near Telok ayer. This place one of the best simple Indian vegetarian food which is very close to the home cooked food. It's a buffet setting, with rice, paapad, rasam, sambhar, two vegetables, naan bread and one drink. The most amazing part is you can pay as per your wish.
4
This restaurant is pay as you like so don't expect any service form the staff.The food is in a buffet form and they have a variety of Indian vegetarian dishes. Oh but do order a drink from the waiter, it's also included in the price that you pay.The restaurant is ornately decorated. And upon checkout you just need to pass some cash (however much I feel is right) to the grumpy cashier dude. We paid about 15 a person and felt it was decent value
4
The food has the quality and taste of a home cooked South Indian meal. The people who work there are volunteers and the cause is a noble one. The meals are healthy and fresh. A meal that most folks in my extended family love.However be prepared to put up with some rude service . I was scolded the first time for not making a booking. Today the volunteer r fused to repeat the drink options because he "already explained them to my family" when I was not at the table. However all of those who run the place are not as boorish but since it is a restaurant run by volunteers, I do understand the challenge to maintain service quality.If you can ignore this aspect, I do recommend it
4
The Annalakshmi chain of restaurants have this unique concept of collecting donations in form of running restaurants at various cities. The concept is simple, patrons get to eat delicious buffet lunch and they can pay how much ever they want at the counter. Their motto is '"Eat What You Want, Give What You Feel, We Believe in You, We Trust You"Since this is a non profit org, the proceeds go back to the society in other forms.This is an fully vegetarian place and the buffet lunch is very delicious. Please be mindful that the people who serve there are volunteers and its their form of community service.If you looking for a simple delicious veg food, this is the place
4
Surprise find. Nice decor, ambient, buffet-style Indian vegetarian place. Seems to be part of a culinary arts school - no a la carte, pay as you deem fit.
3
One of the (dragon) lady scared us. I think she was under the impression that she was being efficient but she was barking at the customers. Great food though and great concept so I would not want to complain much about this place.

I went here last Friday 8 Jan 2016 and quite liked the ambiance. The place has got a good feel to it, cozy and warm lighting. Food is simple vegetarian south indian buffet style. The spread is good no doubt but overall i felt that the food is quite bland from a south indian pallette point of view i.e it would typically suit a foreigner who finds the average indian curry as hot. I dont have any issues as such with the type of food served as their website says that they are " an artistic and cultural organisation dedicated to serving the society through the arts. " so clearly their motto is into serving people and on that account they are doing a good job. As for me the food quite did'nt cut it - a little bit of spice and salt would do the trick though. I would give the place 3 / 5 stars for the ambiance ( the toilets were not a part of the restaurant and you would have to walk out and go all the way out to find it ) and 2 /5 stars for the food. so I guess about 2.5 stars over all. Big thumbs up for the good work they do ( or atleast as they have mentioned on their website ). If I want some tasty indian food, I would go elsewhere

I reserve a table for myself at 8.30 for dinner ...as it was Saturday it was busy ..then they said I have to share my table with someone ..firstly I have not agree but really they don't have any table vacant that time ...so I have to decide yes...the food selection were good ..good ambience... There is no price for the dinner ..you need to pay from your heart ....if u think your food deserve 25sgd ...plz give so ..there is no compulsory ho much u need to pay ..over all it was a great experience...prior reservation is a must .

Its a buffet where the philosophy is of service with no expectations. You just come in pick what you need to eat from buffet and on your way out choose what you want to pay. The 'waiters' are actually volunteers that want to 'serve'. Very light, clean and balanced food.

This place has a noble cause and supports a lot of charitable causes. Food is not charged like a restaurant. One is expected to donate for the food and the cause. The people running this place are excellent hosts and make sure you feel at home. Cuisine is varied and has a very nice home cooked feel. Has a good mix of South and North Indian cuisines. Enjoyed my visits to this place and will fondly remember the noble cause behind this initiative.

Basically from Coimbatore, TN, India (Supposedly origin of this chain) and recently settled in Singapore. Have been visiting Annalakshmi most of the cities and visiting Singapore branch for nearly 6-7 years. Been volunteered at many times in the past. I couldn't even imagine the level of treatment received this evening (Dinner). A total unpleasant one in spite of reservations for our two families. Attitude of the RESPECTED volunteers & the lady at the Cash counter were supposedly thought we were there for a trust or church meal free of cost. No pleasantness or a simple smile on their face in the whole exercise. We felt very bad and the vision of the founder is fading off and going to the dock. I beg the management team to act on this before its too late. Strongly never recommend. God bless.

If anyone is in Singapore OR visiting Singapore, I'd recommend you to visit this restaurant at-least once: You'd come across this to be a one-of-a-kind restaurant unlike any other. We happened to visit this place which rather seemed to be a luxury fine-dining restaurant from its ambiance, it consisted of wonderful artifacts, bronze idols of Indian gods and goddesses interspersed in the dining area, this did not seem to be a place for an average tourist with a shoestring budget. We had our lunch here during the course of our Singapore Tour and the food was a authentic South-Indian fare, of which you can recount the finest details of the taste and aroma of traditional South-Indian food; Behold, this is not the only reason I'm recommending a visit to this restaurant, the bigger surprise in waiting for you is when you are about to pay the bill! :) This restaurant supposedly has a concept of, OR I'd rather call it a tradition of "Eat as much as you like, pay as much as you want". Yes, that's true!! If you even feel that their food just deserves just a dollar, you entitled to pay just a dollar! But I'm sure, just like me, that isn't what you would feel about the food here! You would whole-heartedly want to pay more than what they deserve. :) This is the first time in my life I came across such a restaurant and it was incredulous.... all Kudos to the family, who are the cook, cashier and serve the food here, for such a noble deed. This was pleasant surprise on the last day of our tour it couldn't have ended any better!! :) The restaurant totally goes by it's name .... it's truly an 'Annalakshmi' in every sense

It was family outing along with friend’s family. Location - Close to Clarke Quay MRT (walkable)Ambience - ExcellentFood - Superb.Experience - ExcellentWe went on a Sunday evening. Buffet dinner had good spread. Jeera rasam, pakoda, uttapam, Poori, chope, Paneer, sambar rice, curd rice, biryani, papad, payasam, etc. We tried everything, little little. And every bite was yum. We kept on saying, ‘food is too good’. Indeed food was good, it was neither too spicy nor bland. It was a serene place where we had very good time. We also ordered sweet lassi. In terms of cleanliness, hygiene, concept it is way too good to believe in this modern times.Since you are not billed and have to pay as per your wish, we thought of paying 40 SGD for 4 adults at the start. Then looking at the elaborate and good time we had spend, we donated 60 SGD and every penny was worth it.Just one suggestion: Call them, make a reservation and go. The manager tend to ask same question to everyone. Avoid any awkward situation

We had only been in Singapore a day and didn't know much about the place before we went in there, apart from that it was an Indian buffet. The food was lovely, the ambience was very nice, nice decor, very traditional feel, welcoming people. We shared a table with some other diners as the place was full. The 'staff' were welcoming, I was very surprised when we went to pay and where told to pay whatever we liked. The food quality was very good and we ate whatever we liked. Hopefully we paid the right amount..?! Would 100% recommend this place with lovely philosophy and very nice food. Hopefully we will come back
5
Good South indian food... good cause... nice concept.. accessible.. good ambiance... will visit for sure... gr8 work .. keep it up
5
It's strange to see that they don't charge you for food and it's up to individual to pay. However believe me it's one of the best food i had in Singapore and it was near to hotel as well. It's located in a very nice place. Must visit
5
Came to know about this hotel from my friend residing in Singapore. Annalakshmi is situated in central square building, a calm location. We visited there twice during our stay in Singapore. This is a kind of restaurant run by volunteers of an Indian art school. Here we can pay the money for food as per our wish. No particular amount or not a must to pay. Need to inform them over phone in advance about our visit to make sure of table & food availability. Buffet lunch was really awesome, all items were tasty. Totally felt home there
5
We had reached Singapore on 25-12-2014. We had our dinner the same evening at Annalakshmi. If you are in Singapore, this is 'a must visit' restaurant. We were nine in all. Though there is some waiting time in getting your seat, we had no difficulty getting our table. It was the last table in the corner. Indian food. Unlimited. Buffet. The beauty is you need not pay for eating here. They say, the owner never demands money. You pay if you like! Of course, everyone pays! Food was quite good!

A sit down restaurant in Central Singapore, Annalakshmi, started by two South Indians, is run by volunteers - the cooks including, and all the proceeds go to charity. It is very well maintained, the food quality - unlimited buffet - very good - simple, like it is made at home, and very tasty. There were a few non South Indian dishes - but it is mostly South side food, and it is an enjoyable experience on whole
1
We went to the place at 7 on a Friday evening. The place seated less than one-fourth of its capacity. Having heard from friends and relatives about the good food here, we were really excited to eat here. We were three adults and two kids all together. We hadnt made any reservations as we were not aware of any such requirement. Also, the board outside the restaurant says "For reservations, call:". Its not mentioned that they wont entertain without reservation, in which case the board should read "Please do reserve in advance. For reservations please call: ". Anyhow, a person at the front desk showed us an example of the worst possible behavior in hospitality industry. Tall, bespectacled, this guy gave us a full fledged lecture on how irresponsible of us to just walk in. He pointed out that we cant be doing this, some 10 times and spoke in a rude and high tone. And then he suggested that since we have kids with us, we may wait outside and he will try to do something, again adding how irresponsible of us to have not booked. We just walked out feeling rather insulted. It was such a bad experience that I will never suggest anyone to ever go there. Other than, of course, students from the hospitality industry, who should go there and learn first hand what is unacceptable
5
My hubby brought me to Annalakshmi and I was surprised that Singapore has this restaurant that you can pay any amount that you want. It was an Indian vegetarian buffet. We went during dinner and there were alot of people. Well, it's not because you can pay any amount but I think the food was great - the spread was not that too many compared to western buffet but its authentic and simple indian vegetarian food. If you're into Indian or vegetarian food then you must try the food at Annalakshmi :
4
I was taken here by an Indian friend and had delicious dhal, a spicy brinjal dish and another lentil dish. The accompanying fluffy fried? Bread was very good. The mango lassi was delicious. A really nice vibe and we donated 20 bucks per person. A great spot for a casual buffet meal
1
Hi,I have visited here on weekend. I have made reservation but I was bit late to the hotel. For that reason, managing lady behaved rudely.They really need to learn how to treat their customers. They restricting our order for drinks even we are ready to pay accordingly.They just spoiled our mood on weekend! Not recommended for who really concerned about kindliness and respect
5
I went with my family to Annalakshmi for an early lunch. It was amazing but there were a few things like dosas and mango lassi that they didn't have. They did have a strawberry lassi which was delicious. At the end, there is no bill and you choose the price that you think the food is worth. I thought my plate of food, my drink, and a bowl of rice was worth $17. I am a ten year old and I recommend this to my age and up
4
Authentic Indian food served under a pleasant ambience. Service is great but need to prebook to reserve your seats.
4
Eat as much as you can and pay as much as you want.. Its a restaurant run by a charity promoting Indian Culture in Singapore.. The buffet spread is sumptuous and delicious.. Restaurant caters for both north and south Indian dishes.. You can eat as much as you want and pay as much as you will. A unique concept which promotes visitors to be benevolent and magnanimous..

This was my first experience when a colleague's family took me out to this restaurant. From outside, the place has looks of a fine dining and an expensive restaurant, but in fact it is quite a different experience. I went for a dinner on a weekend and there was buffet spread on offer. I am doubtful if they have ala carte offering. I heard that the server staff is comprised of all volunteers who apply to this institution for social service. I also heard of that there is a very good waiting time to get a volunteership here. Good to hear that a restaurant in Singapore survives on the simple principle of volunteerism. The food was all vegetarian and spread was not that elaborate but consists of all principal items such as breads, dal, rasam, sambhar, rice varieties, papad, curd and sweets etc. I did not find taste to term as amazing but the ambiance and simplicity adds to flavor.The best surprise was that there is no bill served by this restaurant. If you like the food, you are free to give them any amount as charity. Of course, when you add "charity" word then the wallet dolls out a good sum out. But this is quite amazing that the restaurant survives on charity but not on bills etc. Kudos to the owners and staff that they are able to manage it since long, and I tell you that this restaurant is quite in demand and there is a waiting period for most of the time.My suggestion would to be try out this one time, and if the taste suits you then visit them again for sure. And remember, you are doing charity here, not just satisfying your taste buds. As the place is near to Clarke Quay so it is not far from the Singapore tourist circuit
5
Annalakshmi is a very nice cosy place with a very nice ambience. The volunteers are very friendly and treat you as a guest to their house. The concept of serving food without expecting the return is very noble and praiseworthy. The quality of food and the variety is great
4
There is nothing to beat Annalakshmi for south indian vegetarian home food. It is not a typical restaurant. It is not everyday that you get 5 star atmosphere in a place run by volunteers. While a lot can be written in the food, the clincher really is the warmth of people around you, happy to explain and suggest if you are hesitant on trying something out
3
This may be a place for people looking VEGETARIAN food. The food taste is good.The best part of this place is, they don't ask you for any fixed money. Whatever you want to pay, you can pay. :)This model brings a lot more crowd

Hi Friends, I am not sure if the same thing happened earlier with any other guys. I landed at Annalakshmi on Saturday evening around 8:30 PM with my wife and 2 small kids and saw around 5-7 people waiting outside. Then, Curiously i went inside and saw that half of the restaurant was empty. I stepped to the reception guy and told that we are two persons + kids, he told in a very bad tone- "Some other day sir, thank you so much". I was like, how bad the tone was. Then i asked again - Sorry sir- what i heard is that i should leave, but why? He told- have you made a reservation- I said no. Then again he said in arrogance. Then, Sorry sir, Thank you please don't waste your and our time". That old man was really arrogant. I am not sure, if we need to reserve even if the restaurant is half empty. So, guys- Please don't go there unless you want to feel ashamed in front of others. Their concept of paying whatever you want seems, they are choosy and it's like a temple where langar or free food is served. But, No. they are more than commercial. Same thing my friend later told that he once gave s$2 for a bad meal, and their faces were like any bad animals. They are making very huge profits, though acting as a non- profit organisation, please check their financial statements.RegardsAshish Malik. Chartered Accountant, Singapor

One can get in strictly not by pre booking, but having one is appreciated. This is a charity and one can pay as much as he pleased. the food does not disappoint one bit. This is one of the best meals i've ever had. Worth a visit

Tripped into this place quite by accident. It is attached to an Indian cultural center (which we did not have time to visit). The buffet itself was fine; though we found no particularly interesting offerings, tastes, textures or spices. Absent was the Spinach Paneer, a frequent buffet offering (and my personal disappointment), oh well. After eating we awaited a check. No check. Approaching the register, asking ‘how much for two meals’ was answered with a shrug. Come to find out this place is on something of an honor system. I was instructed to pay what I would like to pay. Uniquely refreshing. I did ask what was typical, and was told people pay all kinds of amounts and it was up to me. So….. in addition to the fine food, I was treated to a bit of ‘mindfulness’. To contemplate my meal and what my contribution to the place should be. Nicely played Indian Cultural Center

our group of 4 made a dinner reservation 2 days in advance, @ 7pm. we were on time, the restaurant was relatively empty, with only 2 more tables occupied. we were showed to our table quickly.dishes were placed on a long table, and you can have as many helpings as you can possibly eat ^^ I tried a bit of everything, and I must say, South Indian cuisine is delicious! (even though all the time I couldn't understand the dishes' name and cannot tell what spices are being used)the restaurant's ambience is peaceful. I will bring my friends again :)there are a couple of reviews complaining about poor customer service, I must say we were lucky, because the waiter who took our drinks order was polite and soft-spoken. try the sweet and salted version of Lassi. nice!we each paid S$10 each for our meals. it's part of a contribution to the temple of fine arts, I believe
5
Frequent lunch there after colleague of mine recommended me this place.Nice atmosphere and the people there are friendly as always looking out to see you're well taken care.
Foods are delicious and be back for more for sure
5
For Indian Vegetarian tourists, its a boon... Serves excellent quality food... All in all a great experience after a tiring day at Universal studios...
4
Although the food was just above average, the homely feel and atmosphere made it taste even better. Added with its cultural tamilian setting, it provides with a truly Indian experience
5
This is one of the best restaurant i had ever been in singapore . This gave me a sense of satisfaction and contentment . Really loved the traditional Indian food . The moment You enter the restaurant you will feel the satvicness of the food . They serve good lassies , curd , sambar , rasam and sweets . A must visit if You are visiting singapore .
5
Fantastic food. Courteous staff and a philosophy that makes the heart melt. EAT WHAT YOU WANT, PAY WHAT YOU WANT. It makes you feel special in its own way. The place is filled with warm courteous people who make eating here a very homely experience. Service is with a smile and just having a meal here rekindles your faith in good. It is located at a pretty convinient location. The quality of food served is excellent. A must visit place in Singapore. Thumbs Up.!!!

this restaurant happens to be just near the place of business for me and a senior colleague of mine one day walked me from the office to this place. A very small dining room, 6m x 4m, that's all the usable area but once inside, u have a short smiling reception either by the lady in-charge or by that elderly person at the cash counter. Usually it is full during noon, need to book in advance if more guests are in your group. The food is on a buffet system, rice, sambhar, rasam, upma, roti, poori, sabji, puzhi kulambu, papad, fried rice, onion raitha, etc alongwith juice or buttermilk......believe it or not it is unlimited and then you are kindly asked to pay as you like! Am I in a fairy land?! But religiously every customer gives their due share as per their means, wish and by their heart...as the proceeds go for a charity foundation, if I am not wrong. My colleague said he usually pays around 12SGD per lunch as he is a frugal eater. The next day I "donated" 15SGD for the lunch as I felt I ate more. But the beauty is that they keep silent even if the customers "donated" less than 8 and just continue their work unmindful. I can see students paying as low as 6, understandable though. I think all I could say is that food is served neat and clean, dining room kept tidy, patrons so orderly, service very good...I do not think we need anything more. I see also some negative comments about this restaurant, could be a slip here or there on occasions, but I never was disappointed all the three days I ate. Wishing this institution success. Encouraging everyone to visit there once atleast to show our solidarity towards the social cause

Midday in Singapore and the monsoon rains were in full swing, but after a rave recommendation from a friend we were determined to find the Annalakshmi restaurant for what would be our last lunch in the city before flying home. Fortunately we were quite close when the heavens opened and we piled in, breathless and only slightly drenched, to a space we could see at once, was no ordinary restaurant.For a start there were things to buy and mull over other than food. A table was laid out with Hindu figurines and scripts, some of the wall hanging featured scenes from Indian mythology – not the cheap gewgaws that can be found elsewhere in the city but hand-crafted and painted.Then there was the relaxed atmosphere. Singapore is a city of hustle and bustle, but once through Annalakshmi’s doors, business people and tourists alike seemed to let their busy schedules slip from them, at least for a time. Annalakshmi is a haven of tranquillity, backgrounded by the quiet, unobtrusive service that all too often these days seems to belong to a different age.To the food: Vegetarian and served buffet-style. There were about four different dishes and a soup displayed while we were there and no-one seemed to bother when I went for second helping.The biggest surprise came with the bill. “Pay what you think your meal was worth, or what you can afford,” the elderly man at the desk said. “Everyone must have food to live – and nobody should be deprived of it.”I can’t remember ever being in this position, but fortunately my wife, noticing what the man in front – who looked like a regular – had paid, simply doubled the sum for us.This was certainly one of the highlights of our stay in Singapore, a city that never ceases to amaze us

Being an Indian, valuing indian culture and to do my bit for charity.. I went to this place many times.. but the a couple of people at this restaurant have put me off each time. The people who provide voluntary service have forgotten the essence of a service to guest in indian culture - 'atithi devo bhava' which means a guest is like god and should be treated like one. My first stint with this restaurant when I had just moved to singapore was terrible. A reservation was made at 7.30 in the evening for 4 of us but 2 of us reached early by 15 minutes. We went to the counter a tall guy wearing spectacles made us sit at one of the tables where we waited for our other two friends to join. The restaurant was almost half empty but this guy came to us to complain that we are blocking the seats during peak hours by waiting for our friends. Why were we made to sit in the first place when he knew we were waiting. The attitude of this gentleman killed my appetite and I hardly ateHowever I dint want my first stint to hinder coming to this place as the food is of good quality and good to taste. In a recent instance when I had made a reservation at 9 pm but was told that as reservations were at peak there may be a delay of 15 minutes. I was okay and thought of coming at 9.15 to avoid waiting. But when I arrived the same gentleman tall and wearing speks told me to wait outside and he will call as soon as seats available. I asked him how long the wait was and he said could be 30 to 45 mins. No apologies or no courtesy in his tone to say that we will have to wait due to the rush. I wouldnt mind waiting but his attitude and rude behaviour was such as if we are here to eat for free. When I asked him to cancel my reservation he was more than happy and said 'thank you'. Now is this how the customers should be treated? No apologies no regrets. This is truely not the culture this restaurant should be promoting.Though the people are providing voluntary service, they should be taught how to treat customers and how to make them feel good. I have experienced a rude attitude by couple of servicemen from this restaurant atleast 3 to 4 times. They forget the fact that without the customers and a service to them they wont get any charity. Their service is a black mark to the culture where they boast about their service levels.I would rather pay more at a restaurant which may have average food but good customer service.Overall very poor in service but I like the food served there. So those people who want to have good food but want to experience a service which treats people with rude behavior and makes them feel that they are there to eat for free.. may go to this restaurant. . The servicemen at the restaurant forget that these customers never leave the restaurant without paying and that too more than the value of food as they give charity. Its time for Annalaxmi to realise the true culture of dining experience and means to provide charity. Hope they act soon. Looking forward to hearing some feedback from Annalaxmi managemen

The restaurant is in the middle of the business district. And is always full at any given time. The hall mark of any restaurant that is filled with locals is the food is good.The people who have written reviews and have been disappointed have gone with expectation which have not been fulfilled. At this restaurant food is simple home cooked fare. There is a buffet with 2-3 vegetables and Sambhar, rasam and two kinds of Dhals. We were welcomed by the owner as we waited for our friends and i chatted with him about some of the spice powders that were on display. While chatting i realised that its a charity and there is no fixed price menu. You pay with what you feel the meal is worth. The food we ate here was on par with any south indian thali meal in any other restaurant.Kudos to the owners who are supporting this venture with their own money in case of short fall.Recommended!
5
We at here with a group of friends. We are all vegetarians and love Indian food. The buffet had about 8 different curries on it but I ate everything twice. They had fresh naan coming out all the time and we all loved the tastes. The best thing about this place is no one can complain about how much the costs as you pay with your heart. If you love the food you pay what you feel it was worth. Most people have a good idea what they are expecting to pay for a meal or what they usually pay when they eat out. As this is a non-profit organization linked to the education program, please try this place and share your thoughts. We had a group of 10 and there was about 15 others in the restaurant and no one was waiting for food or service for drinks.Another bonus is a lots of the wall hangings and art is for sale also. You can browse for some great pieces which are relatively cheap. Give it a go
4
Right outside our hotel, this indian restaurant is an excellent place to eat good home food - south Indian. We eat a meal and the host is really good. We look forward to going there on our next visit.
5
Annalakshmi is Pure Vegetarian Restaurant works on principle of Food for all. There is no rates are mentioned. You eat what you like and pay what you want. Varity of south and North Indian dishes are available. Taste is delicious and ambiance is cool.
4
Annalakshmi restaurant offers great value for money. The neatness, ambience, food quality and price all go in favor of this being one of the favorites for lunch. I think the staff though needs to be more friendly.
5
What a lovely food they serve and with so much of love, attention and care. Kudos to their entire team for making it so warm, so comforting and worth remembering.
4
The Food here is very good. The ambiance is nice. I had been with one of my colleague and learnt that they do not charge money for the food. You can pay as you feel. The curry, rasam, sambar all tasted authentic. Must visit hotel
3
Nice philosophy (not for profit restaurant that contributes to arts and charities)... we stopped in for lunch and it was pretty average... nothing exciting... one of the dishes was spicy and tasty but the rest were pretty uninteresting... also, the buffet food was only vaguely warm..
4
Brought my friends from India here for lunch. They were vegetarians and have been visiting Singapore for a few days already. My friends were so very happy as they were able to savour something from home after eating at subway, plain pasta and fries. Food here is also well prepared and service is from the heart
5
I can say this a 5 star place to have Indian, pure vegetarian & homely food. The ambiance is really great & food too. Good to call them in advance before going & tell them how many people you are going to visit, this will help you not to wait in queue. Rates are no where mentioned, eat whatever you want & pay whatever you feel. All staff is very good & friendly. The hotel cleanliness is also really very good. I will surely recommend to everyone to visit this place
5
When you enter the restaurant you shall find the devotional traditional pleasent Welcome with most pleasing manner ever. The food is so best with different varieties. You get Nort indian and South indian varieties. You shall not find any bearers as this is an organised by some no profit organisation which they dont charge you any. How much ever you want to pay is your wish. The people who serve are all people came to service... I thank them for treating us heavenly
5
Annalakshmi follows the principle, "Eat What You Want, Give What You Feel, We Believe in You, We Trust You" a very rare phenomenon for a restaurant. But then all staff perform voluntarily for the pleasure of people who come to dine, a rare service which follows the HINDU Vedic Dharma 'Adhithi Devo Bhava' ( Meaning the visitors are like GOD )I had visited Annalakshmi during my previous Singapore visits.This new place is very near Clarke Quay MRT has the right ambiance of Vegetarian culture, a decent spread with delightful desserts, Lassi of your choice and Tea / coffee at end is really pampering for the visitors.Courteous and helpful people, make advance booking or you may have to wait for long. South Indians will really enjoy the tasty spread. Dont miss Rasam.Two observations - There is no rest room, better finish outside within the same complex, a good distance from Annalakshmi but directions guide you when you come from Rest room.Second, when you order coffee/Tea tell them to bring hot or else it is Luke warm and if u delay it will be in room temperature, a good tasty tea fails to impress.Really worth the visit and enjoying typical (South) Indian delicacies
5
Tasty vegetarian dishes prepared in the authentic Indian style. The buffet spread during weekend is sufficient enough to satisfy my urge for Indian food.
4
This is all vegetarian - I'd have given it 5 stars if they served meat as well. Interesting atmosphere, no hustle and bustle super comfy and peaceful. You make a donation based on what you can afford. I had a mango lassi with my meal and gave $12. Really flavorful, soup and other traditional dishes. I tried to give $15 on my credit card but they want cash for less than $20
3
Went here with some friends and got a large table for 7 of us. Made a reservation, but it was a weeknight so it was relatively quiet. There was a rush at about 8:30, which slowed down the buffet line. Mango lassi was pretty good. I would go again, but maybe not if I was craving particular dishes. Their philosophy is pretty cool, so check out their website and read up
5
Wow , we were amazed to see such a pure veg restaurant in Singapore , pls book in advance, we were surprise too see that there is fixed menu thali with so many varieties and best thing is they don't price it , u pay as much as u wish , and serving people are respected professionals and their wives and children , they serve with so much love and affection , truly beautiful ,
5
Slogan is Atithi Devo Bhava i.e. Guest Is Our God. Only Restaurant in the World where What you like you eat and PAY what you FEEL. Menus are in place but without Prices. Most of days, at the end, income and expenditure matches. After meals, you don't need any stimulants like tea or coffee. Because meals do not make you drowsy but full of energy. It is purely Veg. Every traveler visiting S'pore, at least once should visit Annalakshmi. By
5
What a restaurant its , in Singapore near Havalok road you wont find any Indian restaurants i was 7 days in Singapore last week , last when i went I don't knw about annalakshmi restaurant. but this time i enjoyed a lot with anna lakshmi, u will get great Indian food . and i wonder u know what is the cost its nothing you can give what ever u want.thanks to anna lakshm
4
I've been here multiple times for lunch. The buffet spread is excellent - the food is well made, authentic South Indian, low on oil and fat but high on taste. Being a pay as you like model, it's amazing value for money. It's a great lunch place
3
Had a meal with family (4 people) in this Chennai based restaurant. It has a good mix of South Indian and North Indian cuisines however South Indian is its speciality. Don't forget to order butter milk along with your meal. Staff is friendly and hospital. Pay as you please model makes you think more and you may end up paying more than what the food is worth! :
5
We are fans of the Analakshmi restaurants and seek them out wherever possible as our teens love vegetarian Indian. The food is beautiful, fresh and lovely. The hospitality is wonderful and it is always worth seeking out. Definitely worth finding in Singapore where the restaurant is tucked away in a mall a bit out of sight. Great fun with teens.
5
I really like this place and would visit again whenever I am in singapore. Its a pure vegeterian place with a lot of jain food options. Clean place, nice decore and ambience. Its a classic south Indian food place with options of north indian food. They dont give you a bill and so "you pay as much you wish". I have seen people paying anywhere between 10-20 SGD per person.
4
We had a very satisfying vegetarian lunch, at a modest cost. Would recommend anyone for vegetarian meals.

The best Indian food feast husband and I have ever had.
Not because they don't have a price tag on their menu but by the principle they stand for, without compromising the quality of their food and service.
Will definitely go back for more!

They serve mostly South India style dishes. However the Gobi Manchurian is awesome. Please remember to reseve a seat before landing up. They do not have prices on the Menu & you pay as you Like!!!!

Excellent concept. It's a non-profit; after the meal you pay whatever you like (what you thought the meal was worth), and it goes towards the charity that they support (for performing arts etc). Bit of a queue (couldn't book a table on the night we were there), but great food - would go back there again

I had heard about this place where you pay what you want.. And the image I had in mind was a hawker center kind of place with average food. But when I walked into the restaurant I was pleasantly surprised. Great ambiance. Very nicely done. And we want for the lunch on weekend which was buffet. Unlimited food.. nice range of drinks - different kinds of lassi, masala chaas, etc. And the variety at the buffet was awesome. Excellent food. And really great service. The fact that these are volunteers who serve you just makes it all the more respectful. We paid 10 dollars per head. Definitely the quality of food was worth more.Definitely place to try. Been told its better to call and book cause it full all the time

Annalakshmi has been around for a long time and its basics have not changed, you still pay what you feel is deserved, not the easiest of concepts to handle. The food is typically South Indian, with items like sambar, rasam, curd-rice etc., and Indian bread and rice dishes as staples. While some in our group were very enthusiastic, my wife and I thought the fare was average at best . Furthermore, everyone from the cashier to the waiters is poker-faced, no semblance of warmth or hospitality. Perhaps, as many, if not all, of them are volunteers they feel they don't need to exude charm, but some basic courtesy is required if you are running a service establishment

This restaurant is highly recommended for any person who is pure vegetarian. There is variety of food available in the lunch buffet (mostly south Indian food) and they also serve amazing Mango Lassi (one can opt for sweet lassi / orange juice also) in the end. There is no fixed price / menu card in this restaurant and one can pay as much a person wants. This was really unique and i have never been in any restaurant in the world which does not have any menu card. The food is tasty and one can relish the authenticate delicacies of south India. One must book a table in advance as i understand this restaurant is very popular amongst the veg lovers and you may have to wait a long if you have not booked a table in advance. The only problem in service was that the waiting time for chapattis was on higher side

I am not sure of the other guys writing such good review about this restaurant, for us it was a terrible experience. Booking - We booked a table for 4 , yet had to wait for 15 minutes when we arrived thereStarters Buffet - The starters were OK, though the refill was slow and at no point in time all the dishes were available on the tableMain Course - The Dhal was stale and smelly, Panner Kadai was oily and taste less, Dam Aaloo was horrible and all chapatis were made in the afternoon and were hard. Service: For getting the menu waiting time - 10 mins, for main course - 35 mins Attitude: Ok so I think some volunteers do this as a part of charity. I understand that you guys are not trained, but at least have some basic manners, don't slam the dishes on the table and a smile won't really cost you much. We were four and in-spite of this 2 hr ordeal we paid a handsome amount hoping that it would go for a good cause, though no receipt is provided, We regret taking our guests there. I seriously doubt the authenticity of the reviews here. This restaurant has a cool ambience but apart form that its terrible

I had read reviews of this hotel on TA. Went there with no expectations as i knew we can pay as we like. But, was truly bowled over by the excellent food quality. It was a buffet consisting of typical south indian tamil brahmin food. Also, there are north indian varieties too. I also learnt that the those managing are all ladies; who warmly greet you. Apart from buffet lunch; they also serve coffee, salt/sweet/mango lassi, butter milk which is very delicious. Don't forget to reserve your table before going there. This is one restaurant you definitely dont want to miss on your trip to Singapore. Locating the restaurant can be a bit tricky. Its just behind Ministry of Manpower bldg on Havelocks road. Nearest MRT is Clarke Quay

Nice place nice ambiance and food is simply fantastic. A great place to have authentic tamil vegetarian cuisine. A bit crowded at week ends so make a reservation early

Based on an interesting concept of 'eat what you want, give what you feel', Annalakshmi serves Indian vegetarian dishes. Not knowing what to expect, we were surprised when we asked for the bill and were told to pay what we feel. Even our friends from India were amazed at the business model.The pieces of artworks on the wall added to the ambience of the restaurant and looked as if they were for sale with the price tags on. Our friends from India were admiring the works of art and busy pointing out the various Indian gods that were depicted on some of the artworks.A great place to try some authentic Indian vegetarian food. However, do call to make a reservation before visiting

Ive been here for a few times, fyi this is "pay with your heart" restaurant, BUT their style wasnt like that, its more to upscale kinda restaurant. The food, was really superb, eveytime i came, the menu was changed either, as a food lover, i tried every dish theyve served, everything was good, fresh, well seasoning. If you have a plan to come to this restaurant, you should make a reservation first. This is one of the restaurant in singapore that i miss to come to, craving their vegetarian dishes. If you have a time to try the authentic indian food, this is the place

Heard about this restaurant in Singapore yesterday. 'Authentic vegetarian, Tamilian-Indian cuisine, great experience'! Eat as you like and pay as you like - was a true bouncer! An inspiring business model, I felt. Suddenly there was an urge to check out this place and of course check out food. When the intention is pure, fulfillment is immediate! Got a chance to visit, this afternoon, with two friends!!As I entered, I didn't feel I have walked into a restaurant at all. You feel you have entered a shrine-room of a big house. As I stood in awe, familiarizing with the elevating decor, my friend guided me to a table, he short-listed with the elderly gentleman at the cash. The man at cash looked far from a typical owner/manager at cash - lean, smiling, stress-free and with a tilak on his forehead. He seemed to be in control of the operations and also, himself. Picked up few of my preferred items from the buffet-spread and settled down for a sumptuous lunch. A lady, more like a sister, genuinely interested to serve, offered a drink- varieties of lassi to buttermilk. I opted for a butter-milk. The spread was indeed very elaborate - roti, dal, varieties of rice, urd-vada, sambar-rice, alu curry, pappad, pickle and dessert. Dessert was fresh fruits and a local variant of kheer/payasam - with sabu-dana, sweet potato, coconut, etc. All dishes held the aroma of pure ghee, but none of dishes were too spicy or too oily. Needless to add, every dish tasted most homely. ( That is the best compliment I guess.)Had a brief chat with the man-behind-counter. As expected, there was a spiritual connection, going by Swami Sivananda's photograph. It was started by a follower of Swamiji. You can actually pay 'as you like'. Of course, that is not case with their branch at our own Chennai! I did not ask him 'why' ! I am inspired by the fact they have been able to pull it off at least in Singapore. Brilliant 'business' model. Depending on the level of satisfaction, we can pay. Nature provides everything free. But we put a price tag on everything, for processing/transporting/etc. Great food, courteous 'staff' serving with love...Truly, 'Annam Brahma'

This is one Restaurant everyone must visit and Dine. The concept is very noble and the intention is good. The food is very hygienic and I must say a vegetarians paradise. We all dined and had a very good time listening to Carnation music played at the background. Must go for every Indian Vegetarian Food Lover and rather only place where Indian Swaminarayan Food is available (without onion / garlic)

I had been here for some days since its very near to my workplace. Later, got bored in 3 days. Food quality is not good. And no good varieties. They accept whatever you pay them. Indirectly, you will never give them less than 10 dollars which is a good amount to them. Its a business idea in the way of Charity. I would suggest you to go here, but for an exp and not food

The food is very tasty and rich, staff is extremely friendly and the artwork displayed in the restaurant gives a nice atmosphere. Only downer in my opinion is the "pay as you like" philosophy. I'd prefer given prices for the following reason: Then one is also able to order very expensive dishes if he likes, the restaurant is able to offer those respectively. I would have loved some fresh cut mangoes or a mango lassi but there wasn't any. In the earlier times when the prices were given it was possible to order such dishes

I used to be a regular patron @ Annalakshmi when it was at Excelsior. But I've not tried the new location & the Janata place. So I was quite happy to go there couple of weeks back.It was a rude shock. The people're no longer interested in serving you or taking care of you. The food was terrible. Even the rasam was cold. When we end up at payment we decided to pay $8/person. The staff/volunteer started to mumble and didn't even uttered a word along those lines (thanks, how was the food..)which bring customers back.Then unintentionally we end up two days back at the same place thank to the 'near-by' feel. Oh my god, This is really a shame on the place. This time we've got 'hair' in the food. If you are an Indian or been to Indian restaurants you know how that'd feel.If you are keen on food, you better avoid this place. If to support a charity, then there are tons of charities in town and eager to work with you to help needy.I'll conclude this as a "A failed cause at their best
