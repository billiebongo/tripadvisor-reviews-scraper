Love this Brand for South Indian food as the food very good but cant say the same for this outlet . The food quality was just not upto the mark
4
This place has a lot to offer to vegetarian indian food lovers.
I have been here atleast 8-10 times and have had almost everything.
I highly recommend this place. This place is averagedly priced, food is decent enough and meets all the expectations.
3
When you are an Indian travelling abroad you crave for Indian food in just 3 days. Sarvana Bhavan was just a perfect joint to quench the craving for south Indian food. Its green tomato chutney is a must try.
3
Not one of the good Sarvana bhawans I have visited , the staff is also disinterested and orders do take long.
The preparations are good but the touch is lacking ,
4
this restaurant is serving authentic and tasty south indian delicacies..located in the heart of little india
3
We had to wait for a few minutes to get a table, but very disappointed with the food. Not to saravana bhavan standards. The idiyappams were dry. The chutneys were not too good either. Disappointing.
3
Ok South Indian Veg. Staff do get flustered when big crowds are eating in. Located across from Mustafa Centre. A few veg places close by. Not as good as Chennai Saravanaa Bhava. Can do with better air conditioning.
5
This South Indian food joint offers quick service and nice meals. During peak hours, there might be some waiting but quick turn around.

I had visited restaurants of same name in New Delhi, India well known for fresh, hygienic vegetarian food. When I learnt the same group has a restaurant in Little India, I wanted to visit with my fife for South Indian sweet filter coffee and snacks. We found the dining area stinky, someone even half sprawled with belongings. We could not use the glass provided by restaurant to drink water as it had food particles stuck on the rib. We took water from bottle. Coffee was fine, food looked and smelled great but the plate in which it was served was quite unclean from sides
4
Whenever in the vicinity, I do eat at Saravana Bhavan once in a while. Always mostly crowded, this place is one of the many 'pure veg' havens for vegetarians in Singapore - both for tourists and locals alike. For tourists more so due to its proximity to Mustafa. The set meals, the many dosa varieties and almost all of the dishes mentioned in the menu are good.If crowded there is tendency for the staff to get flustered and delays are caused sometimes. Get in for good South Indian fare as there are others for North Indian food
5
One of the best south and North Indian Food being served here. All kinds of North indian Chaat and fast food is also available. Excellent food quality and service. If in Singapore must visit for every Indian.
5
quality south indian food have visited this chain of restaurants multiple times,south indian food is awesome and quality is always maintained.the rate of foods also reasonable.it will be a good option to all vegetarians for their food.
4
This is one of the best hotel in the Mustafa Center, taste is good, service is better and it’s in the ground floor, it’s easy for elderly to get in to the hotel, prices are affordable
4
very nice south indian type vegetarian restaurant near Little India. worth a visit if you are looking for veg south indian dishes
4
If you leave the ambience aside, then you are in good hands for a lovely South Indian meal. I had the Rawa Dosa, Curd Vada and filter coffee. The taste remains simply the same, be it Chennai or even Frankfurt.
Simply loved it!!
4
This place located in Little India is a boon for Indian looking for veg Indian food.. the food and the service was great although the ambinece could be a lot cleaner..
1
We had to repeat our order to 3 different servers multiple times to get the food we wanted.
My recommendation stay away from this filthy place and save your money.
1
Visited this restaurant on 18 November. The items that we wanted and which were on the menu were not available and they're were popular items so its odd that the restaurant did not have this during lunch time. The Masala Dosais that came were salty as were the sauces/chutneys that came with it. The Chaat dish was equally salty and the pomegranate juice which was touted to be fresh, was heavily diluted with water [I make fresh pomegranate juice at home so I do know what it looks and tastes like] by more than half and it had a crazy amount of sugar in it. All in all, an awful experience and I wont be going back. There are other restaurants in the vicinity that do a better job with their menu
2
We love Sarvana Bhavan restaurant chain in India and went with lot of expectations of have great south Indian food but the food was quite disappointing. The masala dosa was most disappointing, looked like they filled it with some leftover vegetable rather then the dosa masala. Had to ask for paper napkins 2-3 time before we got them (that too very poor quality). Filter coffee order was taken but again we had to ask for it when it was not served, even when it was served it tasted as if made of spoiled milk. Ambience was sorry too, quite disappointing visit
4
We visited this hotel late at night just when it was about to close ... so we did not get to try many options ... we had onion utappa which was nice and masala tea was ok... food quality was nice and service was also good ...must visit for South Indian food lovers .. it is bang opposite mustafa centr
5
Great South Indian food
Food is good.. with a flavor of authentic south indian touch..amazing sambhar and vada , Enjoy the filter coffee. Ambience is decent ,Highly recommended veg restaurant.
5
Very Nice South indian Restaurant, The food was Quality and Healthy. I would like to enjoy ate dosai. The environment was very good, I ate last time on Rava Idly and Sambar Vadai.
3
Looking for quality food as the origin of Saravana is known for searched a long way to find this tiny outlet. Poor Hygiene and average food. Never expected that its Trade Mark Coffee is lost for ever!.
1
Saravana Lovers good for south indian tiffins.
Worst and nightmare for north Indian and make to order dishes and the waiters lack basic common sense who doesn't know sequence of items to be served.
5
If you like South Indian food, i highly recommend Saravanaa Bhavan veg restaurant.
This restaurant also caters north Indian food & indian fast-food like pav bhaji and chana batura,
The staffs were polite and courteous.
5
Nice Family veg Restaurant.You get tasty & authentic south Indian food,Food is tasty and reasonably priced. Service was good and Perfect .Nice place for family dining. Southindian foodies Must visit Restaurant.
3
Its a good place in front of Mustafa Mall, Gives you option of dine out after a busy shopping day. North indian food is not so good.
3
quick service though average food, tried south indian thali.... it is ok for a one time / occasional visit, but certainly doesn't showcase the reputation of actual 'SARVANA BHAVAN'
4
Family restaurant,
Staff are good
Food is tasty
Cleanliness is good
but service is poor
Less staff
Pav Bhaji is not recommended
They are charging service tax and GST
food becomes very expensive.
4
This place serves delicious and authentic Indian Vegetarian food. The portions are quite big. The air conditioning is not too good. Good place to start your Indian culinary adventure.
5
very nice n rich vegetarian indian food, we been to this place with family and just liked it very much.
1
We've walked a long way to this restaurant just for filter coffee because this used to be their signature. Not anymore. Watery and tasteless coffee. Not coming back here again.
3
Food us fresh and delicious in the day. Usually we do not find few dishes fresh in the evening as it may be cooked during lunch and preserved till evening. Seating is OK. No alcohol is served, is a vegetarian restaurant.
3
Visited in april..had Saravanan Bhawan special thali, which was ok. But ordered north indian thali, which was extremely bad. Dosa is good but please do not opt north indian dishes.
4
Just opposite to the Mustafa entrance (number forgotten) is the saravana bhavan restaurant just 3 or 4 restaurants after Anandha bhawan. The food is similar to what is offered in Chennai/Delhi etc., including Idiappam and thalis etc. Had dinner for 2 days in the trip to Singapore and on the first day had idiappam along with coconut milk and veg stew, which tasted very nice. Also had rasam like soup, which was a bit like sambar (would have preferred a more dilute version), but was nice. Next day had the mini meal, which itself was more like a full meal, as it had chapatis, subjis, rice etc. The food is well prepared and the taste is good. The rates are very reasonable and the service is quite okay. You can speak in Tamil and except for some north indian staff, rest understand Tamil well
3
Over the years the standard has drop, not a lot but surely has in competitiveness with others in the same street. The dosa's were average, the bhatura was just too oily. The curry and chutney's were still ok. Others in the street are strong competitors for such dining. Staff, service and pace was good!
3
We ordered 2x masala dosa, 3x idli. Both were good, sambhar a bit spicy. Then order payasam which was very sweet and tasked like made in milkmaid or some similar milk concentrate. We complained to the staff and they just offered adding more milk to it - forget adjusting it from the bill, they did not even accept it was poor in taste. We left it and it was taken away. Filter coffee was similarly average
3
This is a pure vegetarian restaurant located in Little India of Singapore. There are two seating options, outside & in aircon room. Most people prefer indoor seating.This place can be reached by public transport both buses & MRT. Nearest main road is Serangoon road which is a one way & the bus stop is just outside Broadway hotel. Close by MRT station is Farrer Park & it takes less than 10 minutesâ€™ walk to reach the place.Plenty of shops nearby including vegetables, flowers, mobile & other gadgets & lot of Indian style food outlets. Mustafa Centre is a 24-hour shopping place whereas another mall City square Mall is open during business hours only.The total no. of tables is less than 15 & there are 4 outside tables with row of seats for waiting customers. The food is served in stainless steel utensils. Each table is kept ready with a water jug & few plastic glasses. Though mostly south Indian recipe the menu card shows several north Indian as well as Bombay fast food dishes like Pav Bhaji.There is an Indian temple as well as a mosque nearby on the main road & on the week-end evenings the entire area gets pretty crowded so better to avoid it especially when it is raining
3
The restaurant is usually crowded as it is one of the few pure veg one in that area. But the food is not really as good as its Indian counterparts and the service is extremely poor. There are better options to get Indian food close to this restaurant
2
Went for lunch and this was the worst lunch i have ever had at any HSB worldwide. May be this hotel is franchised totally and does not follow any of the HSB norms. So pls be warned if you go for lunch and meals / thali. But may be other items could be better. Will not visit again for lunch
4
Went twice for dinner,
Food is good , ambience requires attention
nice cheerful staff , will suggest a try
2
Sitting is quite ordinary.feels like udipi Restaurant.Rates equivalent to good restaurant. South Indian dosa and coffee is good.
4
Located in middle of Little India at Syed Alwi Road, opposite Mustafa Center, Sarvana Bhavan serves delicious and reasonably priced Vegetarian Indian food. However service is a bit slow as they are lacking in manpower.
5
Although taste was not exactly same as one would experience in Delhi's Sarvana but it was quite good..I visited this place two times during my 4 days stay in Singapore and I liked the food very much.
4
This place serves authentic south indian food with variety of dosas, uttapam, Andhra meals, etc.
Place is usually crowded.
Food quality is good and reasonably priced.
1
Food quality is anyways below average, cleanliness is hardly maintained and to top it all off the staff misbehaves with the customers!! Cant believe !I was there today at 6 pm trying to buy food for my sick wife (doing it since last 2 days) as she is only able to take plain bland foods like idlis and dosas. There are hardly any indian food options here in singapore so had to go back to this outlet despite the fact their food quality & service is not acceptable. They any ways never ever have much available espl idlis and would expect you to choose from 2-3 dishes they have available in their menu for the day.Today again it was one of those days when they only had 2-3 dishes available out of the entire menu and the guy at the counter was in such a rush that he just wanted me to buy "MYSORE DOSA" as that was all he had. Upon inquiring about other dishes he got agitated and started becoming irritable. We are not south indians so our knowledge about their food is limited so hence I ended up asking "what is mysore dosa and how is it different than normal dosa?" After hearing this the guy at the counter started mocking me and raised his voice angrily and said "you are an indian and you dont know what mysore dosa is" !!!!!!! I was shocked to hear this so I decided to get done with it today and never return again. Imagine hearing this in front of an entire full restaurant and that guy almost bullying you into paying for what he wants to sell. Previously also there have been days when they have over charged me for idlis and all but i had ignored it because reason of me taking that food home is much bigger than worrying about a couple of extra dollars they overcharge me, but it clearly shows how rude, cunning and over smart their counter staff is. I am sure management is just happy counting the money as the standard of this restaurant is just going down the drain day by day.I dont understand if they dont have 90% of the menu available why cant they close the restaurant rather then fooling people and saying "NOT AVAILABLE" for every dish! Why cant the staff be more proactive and mention on the menu or a board what is available and what is not rather then expecting every indian looking guy to know what MYSORE DOSA is as if it is the national dish of INDIA!Also some lessons on mannerisms would help! NEVER RETURNING BACK AND WILL KEEP TELLING PEOPLE HOW HORRIBLE THEIR STAFF IS 
1
This is a chain of south Indian restaurants and since we are aware of the Toronto branch, we were comfortable in going to this restaurant. At first sight, the cleanliness looked shaky and we attributed it the busy evening hour. However, when it took over 20 minutes for our orders to materialise and neither staff could answer intelligently as to what was happening to our food. Our food arrived minus the soup and I detected a slight odour to the food. We should have left the dishes untouched but did not want to make a scene.I did however that the order taker aside and told him that the restaurant standard was very low, in terms of food and service and cleanliness. Bottom line - food poisoning for us both. Day and half in bed.In Singapore call the Department of Environment and they handle the complaint competently.Avoid this place

We three adults and 2 kids went there to have lunch after heavy purchase in mustafa. We are all very much hungry and went their. Actually there are no seats available there, we were asked to wait outside and the weather is really very hot so that we were expecting to seat yearly. They called me in a while and we went and order for three meals alone. After 15 to 20 min they came for service. Actually there was a water jug and there were no glasses. We called the server and asked for the tumblers then only they gave that. After half an hour time they served us two meals alone. We started feeding the kids and waited for the another meal. More than 45 min gone. They are serving the other tables and not came to our table. Then only we noticed that , they are serving only for 1 or 2 persons per table and not even giving any excused they purposely made the waiting. My husband started shouting at the servers for what is going on there? In order to not loose their customers going out for other restaurants, they purposely serving one or two in the group so they others also wont leave. With lot frustrations we completed our lunch and came out.the washing area is that much dirty and completely unhygienic. Very bad experience in Singapore and never want to go back ther
1
Been there with my family on a weekend, was seated after half an hour of waiting(you don't get to sit together, we were a group of 6 and sat at two ends of the restaurant, apparently if we wanted to sit together the wait is going to be another hour, so we decided to take what was offered). The staff can be very rude and you can notice them shouting and arguing which makes the whole atmosphere unpleasant. The food is below par- the chutney was stale and the sambar didnt have a taste, you don't expect such bad food at a restaurant with such a big name. The place is very untidy (yes, they clean your tables but don't bother to look down ) and make sure you don't use the washroom before you eat ( You are sure to lose your appetite). Visit this place only if you think you will die if you don't see a dosa the next min. there are other options in the localit
5
Had I dreamt of Indian Food in Singapore! Never!Had I thought I can enjoy Authentic Indian Taste! No wayyy...Yeah, I know customer service is not that good in Saravana Bhavan in Singapore as we see in India. However, it's no way a dampener to get a 5-star rating. Taste was authentic Indian, Dosa was soft and fluffy and great in taste, so was the chutney. It was quite economical and did I enjoy it? Waaayyyyy more than Enjoyyyy...Yeah I know, Using the same yyy, again and again, is not good for readers. But I could not control the exuberance of the Joyful moments near Mustafa center. Its all in all a Must and Should visit for Singapore travellers in search for South Indian Food
5
Found this hidden gem in the basement of my office. Great south indian food at pretty reasonable prices.
4
Needless to say about the quality of Saravana Bhavan. Felt like in Chennai.
Good quality food and ambience.
3
The service was slow - had to ask for a menu card to be handed to us. The service was slow to take order, give bills and generally were uninterested in serving us.
1
Worst Customer Service and Workers are very rude. I don't suggest anyone to go this restaurant. Need lot of improvement.
4
The ghee roast and dahi vada were great. Quick service and tasty food. Would recommend this over Murugan idly which is further ahead on the same road.
4
Idli, Dosa, Upma, Sambhar chutney and Sweet shira along with coffee- what more does one want! This is real value for money - a must try if you visit this place right opposite Mustafa Gate 5 on Syed Alwi road
5
I was visiting Singapore with family from Canada. This place made me feel like I was in India. In fact the whole of little india food is great and the taste of Sarvana Bhavan in singapore was similar to the one in Chennai
5
The food is delicious and the service is good. The everage wait time for your order is 5mins. Cheap food as well and very easy to locate. We had mini breakfast plate which had 5 varieties of food. The chutney is so nice that it reminded mmy mum's cookin
4
A South Indian Restaurant located in Little India. Clean compared to many other places serving similar food. Quality of food very good, authentic South Indian dishes. Iddli, Thosai and Vadai are very nice. Popular for Breakfast. Opens at 8 am on the dot. Parking available around the area but often finding a vacant spot could be tricky. Staff are friendly and service is quick. Would recommend a good workout before eating here as they tend to use ghee in some of their dishes. But that's what Indian food is about. So if you do want a go at this cuisine might as well enjoy the evil.
3
We visited Saravanaa Bhavan once during our stay. The food & pricing of the food were decent but the service & attitude of the staff wasn't great. It seemed like only people who spoke Tamil were welcome. Komala vilas & Komalas were better, both in terms of food & hospitality
4
Hello,
If you guys are searching for proper indian food, your search is over. Best food it feels like you are in India.
It is recommended if you want indian food.
4
“Delicious south Indian cuisine”
Best south Indian food in Singapore.. range is wide, service and price also comfort,must go and have food there. Favorite to kids,very nice experience.
4
Authentic south indian food...great taste and service. The rates are also absolutely economical. Need to work on hygiene though
1
Avoid avoid. They think good food is two inches of oil. They think good service is to hide in the kitchen and let others do the work and clear the tables. Every table complained. Many evenings spoilt. Manager couldn't care less.
3
We visited this hotel on the Diwali day and there was no special arrangements. Food was just OK and overall I am not satisfied. There was shortage of staff and hence there was lack of hygiene too.
5
We have been to Saravana Bhavan Syed Alvi Rd. many times after hectic Mustafa shopping. Very nice place. Excellent Indian Veg. food & price is also not very high. Good & fast service. Staff is also quite friendly.
Highly recommend to everyone.
3
Restaurant specialises in south Indian delicacies. The taste in authentic and price is economical. Had dinner when I was visiting the Mustafa Center and a number of times in the outlet in Suntec centre. I would recommend the south Indian dishes in case you plan to eat here
3
We were in LIttle India and had a hunkering for home style dosa and idli. Had never been to Saravanaa Bhavan before and decided to try it out. Not disappointed. Good food, clean restaurant and family ambience. Prices reasonable and portions decent. It was a bit of a throw back to earlier times in life and a nice walk down the "taste" memory lane. A nice restaurant to check out the next time you go shopping at Mustapha's. They are right across the road from this iconic shopping centre in Singapore
3
Have been there several times with my wife and son. This was just remodeled about a month ago. The staff is nice and the place is cleaned. We go when not so many people. My wife does the ordering so I am clueless but I do enjoy very much. The only issue is that we are hungry again in a few hours
2
Seriously - with so much great South Indian food in little india - how can this business survive ? Dosa was crap - chapatti for my wife was like card board and they didn't serve us orange juice and coffee but of course they made sure it was charged in the bill! To make matters worse - when I requested a refund for that - the owner told me to wait outside in the pouring rain (with two toddlers) so he could let other customers take the table. Simply astonishing . If you want good South Indian good try Ananda bhavan on serangoon rd. Not going here again- waste of money and time. Service just as bad.
5
Nice South Indian Food. Quite a number of Options to choose from. They too offer north Indian food. The Thali options are worth the try. Quality of food is good. Pricing is reasonable.
4
I am visit this restaurant during my stay in Singapore. Having good service & food quality. Located opposite to Mustafa Mall.
4
Sarvana Bhavan in Singapore offers good variety of South Indian food. Sambar is very good in taste. Madras Coffee is also very good and unique kind.
5
Always we feel comfortable with taste and quality. No second opinion about quality. With confident we can enjoy food at syedAlwi branch. More like eating again and again & saravanabhavan site new look was Pretty good.
4
We went to vacation on my cuisine house in Singapore, one day we ordered through online on saravanabhavan.com.sg , Food reached my home on Exact time & food packing also good, good service . I highly recommend this restaurant
1
This not the place for anyone who is very hungry ... The service is slow. It's not cheap either... The place is air conditioned so one can sit and chat while waiting .
3
Basic food, nothing extraordinary. Have better places around. Service average. There was no specific food available when asked.
3
Knowing their chain in chennai, it was sheer disappointment when I visited here. Wanted to have some authentic chennai food but it didn't meet the standard of typical Sarvanan bhavan of chennai. The place was not clean and staff was pathetic.
2
I had lot of expectations before entering the restaurant,thought to be a part of famous. Chain of Saravana bhavan, ordered masala dosa , poor service ,dosa was not hot but side dishes were good, ordered coffee which didn't turn up even after 15 mins, owner even didn't bother for my concerns. Average hotel. Cleanliness not up to expectations
4
I visited this place with my family for dinner. The food was good and the service was quick. However there is a scope of improvement in quality as it doesn't go by its name. The chain of restaurants in India offer far better quality of food. But its a good choice to visit this place in Singapore
4
we visit singapore last year with my friends this restraint south indian foods available economy price
5
Probably one of the well known Indian vegetarian restaurant chain outside India. It's value for money. And if you are vegetarian and looking for some quality food, don't look further. This is best choice. I love their mini tiffin.
5
here the meals are very tasty and also very healthy. i like that atmosphere also. that was amazing. service is very good.
4
Service was good , interior and staffs also friendly , dosai very crispy and chatni also good, price was ok.....
5
the taste of indian foods in singapore was so good . My friends and i enjoyed well at saravanaabhavan restaurant.
3
dishes are not that great. Prefer to go to anand bhavan on seragoon road. took long to time to serve the food, and food taste was not great at all. did not visit again in my duration in singapore
3
This resturant is opposite the famous Mustafa. Good idly, dosa... The sambar is typical of chennai. The service is so so. Place is small and the ambience is not usual Saravanan Bhavan standards.
3
The food is average. Not the best you can find, but not the worst either. Overall it was a decent visit.
4
This resturant even though not that popular here, it's taste is quite good... Similar to chennai Saravanan Bhavan. The combo of Idly,vada and coffee was very good. Idiyappam with coconut milk.brown sugar was quite nice.
4
Hi,I have been to this restaurant near Mustafah.The staff was very polite and food was very good in terms of quality and quantity. Price was at lower side which is a plus point.Recommended for those who want to try vegetarian food.Regards,Prakash Matuwan
3
had masala dosa there.. its nice.. always a waiting period of 15-20 mins... Can go if you want south indian cuisine.
4
Near mustafa , food is good , idli dosa and South Indian tiffin are good and tasty. The hotel is not clean and the seating is not comfortable. Brand of Saravana anad food is tasty
2
The restaurant does not stand upto the mark when compared to the outlets in india. the food was not hot.. also the taste was not authentic south indian.
3
This joint located at Syed Alwi Road is located at a prime location, bang opposite the Mustafa Center. It can be quite crowded and busy during weekends. The food preparation was average compared to the other Sarvana outlets in Singapore. Service was slow.
4
This place is a decent restaurant with South Indian food. We tried their combo meal (Masala Dosa/1 Wada/Tea or Coffee) for $7. Not very expensive. Charges service charge and GST (~15%). Friendly staff with a quiet environment.
4
Had visited for lunch during my brief stay. Typical Saravana bhavan like in chennai, but offers both snacks and meals. It is in the basement, closes by 7 pm, so missed out first day. Food is good as you would expect, with reasonable rates.
4
From Delhi to UAE to France to Malaysia to Singapore- it will never disappoint. The same taste, reasonably priced, lovely South Indian Food and a neat selection of beverages. Overall a good place for a quick snack/meal
3
We often go hear for a quick meal with the kids.Dosas are always good. Thalia's are fairly decent, but not exceptional.Lasis are sub-par. kids get mango and it is merely the sweet with some mango syrup.Waiters don't seem to care too much - tough to get attention or a smile.Bathroom is utterly horrible
2
During my recent visit to Singapore, I visited this hotel as many people suggested that you get good Indian food there. After going there, it is very disappointing. You can find their rest rooms very dirty and with cockroaches. Food (we ordered dosa) is served directly in the steel plates. Even a very normal hotel in Hyderabad, you will see a banana leaf or polythene sheet. Food quality is ok. After visiting Komala vilas (1/2 km away from saravana bhavan), I found that Komala vilas is 100 times better than saravana bhavan. Komala vilas is maintained very neat
5
It was holiday time with kids and This Saravana Bhavan near mustafa was a blessing in disguise for us - myself, my son and daughter. We were put up in Little India between September 26 and Sept 30th. It was a real pit stop actually for break fast, lunch and dinner depending on the tour schedule. Kids loved this place and the restaurant manager at Saravana Bhavan there. The food was awesome as always and the service was personalised and caring. for 2 rounds of idli and 3 different varities of dosas plus one filter coffee costs only 20 SG dollars. It was worth the money spent - which ensures that the food intake was cleanly and good for the tummy in a foriegn country. Kids loved the experience he
4
I was craving authentic south indian food for a while. I live in Tokyo with little access to it, so when i gotto SGP, i made sure that 1 meal was at SB. Mouth-watering
3
We took dinner here. The items are good,but taste cannot match indian authenticity. Service was very poor. Requires to be reminded
3
Used to frequent this place for years. The service got deteriorated. No motivation and attitude issues. Food is still tasty and good.
4
For the ones who miss their dosas and idlies. Great place to savour your taste buds on sambhar dosas and idlies. However right into little India so you probably do not feel you are in Singapore
Everything Indian for someone who misses india in Singapore
4
With high expectations we had been to this hotel. However, the food was not so good like other saravana bhavan. The price was not worth for the food.
2
horrible experience at suntec city sarvana bhavan, asked for a masala dosa and the 'masala' was not even one tablespoon. spoke to the cashier and he said this is their 'standard' portion size. Explained to him that Ive been eating at their restaurants around town and never in the last 10 yrs has this been the case, he just made a blank face...never again
1
They gave stale applam. When it was pointed out they did not bother to replace. The sweet kheer was substandard and over all veg south Indian thali was a major disappointment. For ten minutes the table was not cleaned and the plates were left as it is. There is nothing to rave about this hotel. The management seems to be lackadaisical in running this establishment
4
Whenever we go to Universal or Sentosa, we stop by Saravanaa bhawan at Vivocity Mall top floor from where Mono rail to Sentosa arrives/depart. Excellent place for vegetarians like me with plenty of options for kids as well.This outlet is located inside a food court which is bit rustic, contemporary in interiors. It is different from other food courts and looks classy. You need to arrange for your sitting, the only hassle I find, if we visit during peak hours.Mini meals is one of the best options if you want to taste everything from South Indian varieties: Dosa, Idli, Vada, Sweet, Cutneys. Special meal is also good but make sure you are hungry as the portion size is good. Thumbs up for Mango lassi.You can actually order anything from the menu including some of the rotis and north indian. They are good in taste.Service good, hygiene maintained, clean place
4
This place has seen better times in terms of motivated welcoming waiters. It has also seen better ambience but may be the motivated staff made you feel more welcoming and enjoy the ambience. It's a pity that a restaurant that bears the name of an illustrious chain is losing its sheen. More so, when even now the Chefs prepare consistently excellent food - true to their South Indian roots. I would still recommend this place to anyone who wishes to savour authentic South Indian vegetarian cuisine. More than the main dishes - be it dosa or appam or Idlis - the side dishes, the chutneys, sambar, etc. are authentic and this is rare in other restaurants in Singapore. If you wish to try authentic South Indian filter coffee, then it has to be at this place. Not too expensive but one can easily complain about the size of the meal portions - may be that also shows how much you enjoy the food!I really hope the owners of this franchise would read this review and strive to bring back the days of the glorious past. I hope they would do this before the quality of food also starts deteriorating. May be other restaurants of this same chain like the one at Shenton Way (Axa building) can show them the way.
4
We were taken to this restaurant by locals who highly recommended this establishment. I think it helps if you have someone who understands the menu and the options which we did. He was able to place the orders for us and we had a variety of options to taste. Good food and lots of fun. Service good but I would not say exceptional

The crave to try the Indian Brand restaurants overseas took a hit with compromised standards and reckless service attitude. The locality provide much better options later regretted for having wasted the time at this place.
4
serves south Indian and north Indian veg food, tastes good but a bit crowd always difficult to find a seat
4
Must try the idly, dosa and Dahl vada...all dishes are served with 4 types of chutneys...quick service...clean and well maintained place
4
Good food
not so expensive
lovely ambience
that should summarise the review.
and my fav was the thali here and even the north indian food.. the tandoori roti!!
4
One of the best places in Singapore to have authentic South Indian cuisine. The restaurant is right across the road in front of Little India Mall complex.Service in the restaurant is quick. Rava Plain and Rava Masala Dosa here were excellent. The taste of the Dosas and Sambhar is comparable to what one will find in India and pricing is normal per Singapore standards. The overall ambience and sitting inside the restaurant though is average.Must go place if someone is looking for good vegetarian Indian food options in Singapore without bothering about the restaurant ambience
4
Amazing north indian food.. i always come here for the south indian food but this trip was a surprise. we loved the north indian food here.. roti at its best..i always shy away from indian food outside India especially due to poor quality of roti..but this was a surprise!!also the lunch thali are good.. coffee suprem
4
This place is best for breakfast. If you there around 9, the aircon is on full blast as are religious songs. The place smells of incense and good food. Try the pongal vadai with coffee. Or the masala dosai. All served hot and promptly. And all under $10. (as an aside, google Saravana Bhavan owner for an interesting story.
2
The hotel is named after mighty chain of of top quality South Indian restaurants, but apparently is handed over to novices. The food was not up to mark and coffee ( the hall- mark of South Indian Hotels) was insipid. The hotel is located very close to Mustafa Mall, that being the only plus point. Come on Saravana Bhavan
4
We were served non vegetarian food during our business meet and hence we opted for Saravana Bhawan. Unlike India where most of their restaurants are overcrowded, the one at Suntec Convention Centre was surprisingly empty, with just a few Indians here and there. Food was as good as in India, just a little expensive. It was a self service restaurant. Only glitch was that it was situated in the food court where people eat different kinds of food and hence there are different kinds of smells...something hardly expected in India
4
Saravanaa Bhavan at Singapore is located in Little India, close to Mustafa Market. The name Saravanaa Bhavan inspires every one as this is a well noted Hotel chain in Tamilnadu.After a hectic shopping at Mustafa Market, we peeped in this Restaurant for dinner on 11th February 2016. Wow..A variety of menus were available, ranging from South Indian special Meals, Mini meals, Chappatis/Rotis and in addition varieties of Dosas.The restaurant is very impressive and ambiance is good. This made a perfect satisfaction as soon as we entered. Our group opted to have Dosas and some ordered Vegetable Biryani etc.All the items ordered were tasted by all of us. Yummy, the good was great. We felt as very homely, away from Home. We were miles away from our Place but the food made us feel that we are at Home. The cost goes with the quality of food and the service.There are more branches of Saravanaa Bhavan at Singapore, located at different places I wonder how they are able manage the chain of Hotels at this Far East Places, so smoothly and with such a quality of food Great job indee
5
One of the best place for pure vegetarians in Singapore. The restaurant is very famous for its traditional South Indian Thali. Apart from its famous Thali, even South Indian food of the restaurant is delicious.
3
Slow service. Good food. Do not try north indian food. Bit costly. Little more cleanliness required. Not again.
5
I visited this place during my Singapore visit in December 2015 with family. I had lunch over there. There are good amount of food variety, specially, south Indian food.
4
Saravana Bhavan is part of the Chennai based chain on hotels and offers the same quality and taste at Singapore as well. Food is good, service average though, good place for South Indian food
5
Next to Murgun Idlis, this serves everything else
From Idli, Wada, Dosa, Lemon rice, tamarind rice etc.
The sambar was fantastic
I had their patented 14 Idlis (Mini idli) dunked in delicious sambar.
The tamarind rice was also very good
4
Had breakfast there few times and experience was always good. Would recommend this to people who prefer good south indian stuff.
4
Saravana Bhavan is one of the most important food chains from South India (primarily Chennai) that has branches all over thw world including, NYC, San Francisco, Europe and Singapore.Rather than serving food traditionally on a banana leaf (Komala Vilas or Madras Woodlands), they have more of a fast food chain kind of a concept. But don't be fooled by that, the food they service is amazing and the prices are competitive too
3
I visited the city branch of sarvana (temasek towers) quite regularly, for breakfast and sometimes for evening snack . I have tried a few dishes, and pepper pongal and dose stand out in their freshness. They make a good attempt at a decent coffee - but their fried stuff is avoidable
3
If you are about to die and you are vegetarian, then ONLY order meals at this place. We were craving for Indian food and thought to eat South Indian meal. At the risk of sounding dramatic, it was horrible experience.Ok, let me be practical. Staff - well behaved and politeFood - we ordered meals and this is not what you call a tasty foodCost - decentOverall - as far as meals are concerned, I will not recommend it to anyone. May be Dosas are great
5
This is one one of the best chains around south east Asian countries where you can taste authetic South India Cuisine of India it is comparatively less spicy in nature then India. But home like food away from home i liked it very much must try.
5
Tasty authentic vegetarian food . Good place for Indian tourists looking for Indian food . Wide variety of dosas idli potato vada tasty coffee. They have set thali for lunch South Indian style and North Indian style too . Prices are reasonable. Must visit place
4
Food quality is good
Open after 9 am so very difficult to get early morning breakfast
rates are also quite reasonable
Suggest everyone should try here
4
When you crave for pure veg indian food out of india, such restaurants serve as a boon.
We tried, chole bhature (authentic punjabi flavour), paneer preparation (again awesome) and a lot more.
All dishes are good as they have an excellent cook.
5
We had a south Indian meal which had options of chapatti rice vegetables and sweet. The vegetables were cooked in coconut oil and had south Indian taste.
4
Ordered a Vegetarian Thali, the portions were adequate and the quality of food was quite good. The sambar and rasam were tasty. They could serve one more chappati. Unfortunately the coffee tasted inspid. The Hotel has to think seriously about this Coffee disaster
4
Had dinner here on 22nd Dec late in the evening. We were one of the last few customers. While the food was good, the waiter, a Sardar forgot few things. Rasam was never served and it took few reminders to get it. Billing was also bit chaotic where we were charged for Badam Kheer (which was not available then), rasam was not charged. Barring the service, the food served was good in taste. Worth a visit
5
Indians living in Singapore have to often go to Mustafa Center for their bulk grocery shopping, which can be a very tiring experience ! One needs a good meal thereafter, and there is noting better than Saravana Bhavan, if you are looking form a tidy and cosy vegetarian only place. So far we have only tried their south indian menu, but we are greatly impressed by their service, and food quality. Highly Recommended 
5
My wife and I ate the most delicious vegetarian lunch in Sarvana Bhavan Restaurant in Syed Alwi Road, Little India, Singapore. We had been in Mustapha shopping centre, but saw nothing we wanted, so exited the building and saw this vegetarian cafÃ© in front of us.We are not vegetarians, but decided to give it a try, and found it to be tasty, filling, and a lovely experience
2
Have been to the Sarvana Bhuvan in india and they have always been a great restaurant. I had been to the one in Delhi. It was awesome food but the one in Singapore is a huge let down.. service was bad had to ask 4 to 5 times to get a item.. even hygiene wasn't great... not so good expierence
2
Saravana Bhavan had established reputation of being a quality vegetarian restaurant across the globe. I believe Saravana Bhavan in Little India Singapore is a black mark on that reputation. In our recent trip to Singapore we happened to visit Saravana Bhavan for dinner, I must say this was the worst every experience I had with HSB anywhere. I have been to their restaurants in Chennai/Dubai. First of all the service was pretty bad, cleanliness of the place was in question, the staff was more of disengaged, the attitude was not so great. The food served was just ok ( Dosa's and Channa Batura). The icing on the cake was the Coffee served with few strands of hair in it. When pointed to the staff and floor manager , they were not even apologetic, and said we will change the coffee. I just cancelled the order paid for the dinner minus coffee and walked out.There is a huge following in Tamilnadu for HSB, and people turn up in their restaurants with trust across the globe. With such standards of cleanliness and quality in the land of Singapore, I am surprised how this restaurant is still operational
4
We were looking for an Indian restaurant in VivoCity and found Sarvana Bhavan. The food was very good & tasty.
4
Good solid food - both South and North Indian. Fresh ingredients. Menu a bit odd in that certain dishes are only available at certain times - and in our case one item which was supposed to be available, wasn't. Service is OK - good enough.
4
best south indian food in singapore..
range is wide, price is ok. try ghee roast dosa for sure, there speciallty.
5
Meals tried by all our family (5 members) was excellent and true to saravana bhavan style and taste. This place does not disappoint.
5
We had lunch from Saravana Bhawan, really nice. We tried mini meals. It was really good, with sambar rice, curd rice, 2 chapathis, good enough quantity. Mini meals was not really mini......
3
Was a tad disappointed - average food - bad coffee. The service was OK. But the best part was a Sardar Waiter in a South Indian restaurant in Singapore. Mera Bharat Mahan!!!
3
The need to search for vegetarian food led us here but frankly all the food seemed only average to me, I have had better south Indian food in Mumbai. We had one south Indian meal and one Masala Dosa, whilst it was all okay and not bad, nothing out of the ordinary really
3
Had a dinner here during my SG visit. Location is good, right opposite Mustafa Center, among myriad of Indian restaurants. Restaurant was not very clean, little messy. Service was very late. There was a local chinese waiter who was doing his best but others were not so active. Food was good and cheap too
5
It is indian vegetarian restaurant in front of mustafer shopping center gate no 5 . It has all the South Indian dishes . The sambar and chutneys are very tasty .mini idli with ghee is the best . The food is light so you feel good after having any meal any time of the day 
2
We visited this chain of restaurants during a recent visit to Singapore. the food was bordering on the average and the service left a lot to be desired. we had to repeat our order and finally it was brought to our table with mains arriving first before starters. would really not go back unless i was forced to
5
great south Indian veg food , paradise for vegetarians in Singapore.Variety is lavish , prices are mid ranged , great food great taste
4
Great place to visit in Little India, Singapore. Reminds you of the tastes that Sarvana Bhavan is famous for. Good clean ambiance.
3
Dont' expect something like the one in Chennai, India. But, It's a decent hotel to try for veg food.
4
Good food, decent service, little over priced.. very good ambience Next to Mustafa ..we can enjoy Indian food
4
Went to their Harbour Front location food court. Only place to serve Indian veg there. So definitely saves the day. Quick service.....hot food......reasonable prices.
What more can you ask for?? Suits the purpose. No great ambiance....but then its in a food court.
4
We opted for special lunch&it was good.
Sambar,karakuzambu,vegetables were tasted like the one in chennai
Pooris were little bit oily&over fried that can be avoided.
Sweet pongal was so tasty.
2
Disliked:
Taste of food
Service is slow
A bit overpriced
Liked:
Nothing in particular; avoidable especially when you have Murugan Idli located 3-4 buildings away
5
First Day when we visited Singapore We Had Food in Saravan Bhavan ,
its right opposite to Mustafa Market ,
moderately priced !!!
Food IS awesome !!!
Its and ideal place for south indian Food lovers !!
2
We (me & my husband) visited this place in Little India Singapore considering its good reputation back in India but i must say that we were so displeased by the food quality and taste at this place. This place is nothing like authentic sarvana bhavan outlets everywhere infact the one in Paris serves better food than this place.They have not only very poorly cleaned dishes in which they serve the food but also very untidy tables as well.We ordered biryani with mix veggie curry there and it was no where close to biryani. In fact we felt that their cook just mixed few vegetables with boiled rice and then added lots of garam masala to it to further make it pathetic. Similarly the veggie curry was pathetic beyond words. It had no taste at all, i mean "AT ALL" in fact it was full of red chilli which burnt our stomaches . We couldn't finish our dishes because of both the reasons and later when we complained about the taste of dishes to the current manager which he simply ignored by just smiling as if we were complimenting the skills of his chef. I would highly recommend everyone to "AVOID" this outlet of Sarvanan Bhawan in Singapore if you want to save yourself from pathetic & unhygienic food as there are plenty of options nearby this place to satisfy your tastebuds
2
Not at all like Chennai Saravan bhavan. When I visit this chain in Chennai I used to see in their ad as also in Singapore, Dubai etc., but as it says actually it can be said as " also in Singapore ". Nothing good here as per the original taste. I visited their place in Sun city also. Not good. Even now they can correct and improve
5
Tamil food is exceptionally tasty. One will get tempted to ask for more and order more dishes. Happy binging!
5
This restaurant has become my 'go to' place for a nice south indian restaurant.
I have here the 'Mini Tiffin' which has mini idlis,dosa,upma and sheera and ofcourse the sambhar and chutney.I wash it down with a nice cup of filter coffee .
5
It is awesome to have nice south indian food here in Singapore which we taste in Indian outlet of Sarvana Bhavan. ........ must visit place for an Indian.
2
The ambiance was very dull & poor, they were servicing an aircon when we entered, the food tasted average, Filter coffee was OK
5
I must say that sarvana bhawan is an amazing place to have a mouth watering meal in singapore's lil india. Well the location is very obvious due to a lot of indian crowd being directed towards that area but the food and service is all together very good irrespective of the street in which exactly it is located. One can visit the place without a second thought and have the true south indian essence. I recommend for south indian lovers all the food served and others the ice cream sundaes.
4
Happened to be here on a Thursday evening for dinner, decided to order sambhar vadai, idli, plain utthappam and a curd rice. All was within a moderate price. I was also very hungry after a long flight and had a voracious appetite that day and the food did not disappoint me. The place is quite small compared to their outlets in India but is well served and always there is a medium crowd. Can patronize for its quality and price, for sure the service is an added plus. Located just opposite to the famous Mustafa, nice place to eat after an extensive shopping or before shopping
2
Was anticipating a good breakfast before i got into Mustafa's but i was sorely disappointed. My thosai order was wrong and it was changed but it was a letdown. The accompanying chutneys was sparing and it was rather difficult to flag for refills. The vadai was a little too thick and heavy, the tea was weak and the apom was difficult to swallow. I frequent the malaysian counterpart in bangsar and the food quality and service is really good. Which is why I always say that the average food quality in malaysia far exceeds that in singapore. Just as an aside, i was reading the papers when an indian family of 4 sat in the table next to me. The my food arrived and i moved my paper a tad so the waiter could place the plate and as this was happening, the head of the family proceeded to reach out from his table and slowly pull the newspaper!!! I said calmly, "i am reading it", but he continued while looking at me, as if to say, 'well its my turn'. The calmness disappeared and in my most gruff voice repeated it and he then sheepishly looked away. These things do not happen in malaysia. 
3
Yes, it was better than other options we checked but not very good, as it's counterparts in India.Maybe it has mutated as per locality.Dosa was ok, but sambhar didn't taste authentic and quantity of Sambhar was very less in a small bowl.Pricing was ok as per Singapore standards. The restaurant cooks should be rotated with ones in India
4
What more do u ask when u are travelling and you can get good indian food, this sarvana bhavan is better than what i have tried in dubai, as the smell of food is very authentic and good varieties of option in meal option.. lot of other restaurant in same area.. but sarvana still maintains the qualit
3
Visited this famous chain in Singapore with great expectations of taste and service. Taste was of course really good as at other chain restaurants. But the service was really pathetic. The staff was very unprofessional and slow. They were taking orders without writing anything down and while reaching the order desk they all were forgetting the order placed by any of the tables then either they were making mistakes in serving the ordered food or were just shouting the order desk on one end of the restaurant to the customer to reconfirm the order, so unprofessional approach of such an international chain. This did not happen with me only but with almost all the occupied tables. Service was also pretty slow.But the silver lining was the authentic sarvana bhavan taste for which I visited the place
5
We tried one of the outlets in Suntec city and was quite pleased with the fresh preparations and value for money meals.The Thalis are excellent and very filling. Ambience id ok since it is situated inside the mall.
4
Tried their Suntec Mall outlet. Quite good and reasonably priced. Seems popular with the Indian office staff too. Worth a try if nearby in Singapore
5
Pure veggie outlet, decently priced, noisy coz of the location and the sheer number of people. All in all , well worth it.
3
Food quaity/taste is ok, the service is really slow. They seem to be grossly understaffed for the crowd they get. Need to improve on service speed.
4
Saravana Bhavan is a place for homely and consistent food.It;s a must visit for vegetarians.Wide variety of food and good locations.Filter coffee is a must try.
4
Though the taste is bit different from Chennai branches, they do bring in the memoirs of TN dishes. Coffee is a must here with Sambhar Idli
2
I recently had been to Saravana Bhavan in Singapore. Trust me the quality of the food is no where close to the quality in India. The claim of Sarvana Hotel of single taste completely goes for a toss here.I feel there are better restaurant in Little India and in fact cheaper compared to this hotel to satisfy your south Indian food requirements. Try them.
4
Authentic Vegetarian food can be got here. My first time at this singapore branch. The taste is comparable with other branches all around the world. The food was above average and the pongal-vadai combo was the best and mouth melter. Filter coffee is aomething you shouldn't miss
4
quite fresh 7 filling food you can njoy at this eateryit is close to what you can get to south indian cusine out of india..enjoyed many dishes with friends,.... it was like having a taste of home food away from home...value for money.
5
This was probably the best, and most unexpected, meal we had during our Singapore trip. The menu is so extensive that I went for one of the mini meals in order to get a taster of a few dishes. It came with vegetable rice, a cauliflower curry, mixed veg curry, raita, chapatis, popadom and a sweet dish - reminded me of sweet dahl, no idea what it was called though! Every mouthful was honestly so incredible that I am now even more desperate to go to India! My other half is half Indian and spent a month in India just over a year ago, and even he said how authentic and delicious the food was.We had a really funny, young guy serving us who was great, and everything was SO cheap. The restaurant itself is very basic, so not somewhere you'd go for a nice evening or romantic dinner, but for a casual lunch it is not to be missed
4
The restaurant in Vivocity level P1 is costly but good food.It is costlier than Non Veg food in Kopitiam In level B2 of same complex.So for Non veg go to level B2 and for Veg.go to P1.
4
im crazy for south indian food Mini Meal, Dosai, Uttappam Simple Awesome.....
One must visit this restaurant to have great South Indian & pure Vegetarian food.
2
Pros: lesser price. Some items taste good.
Cons : service and ambience are very low.
Esp their branches at jem etc are far worse than this main branch.
4
Good Quality, fast service, clear area, not very crowded during last afternoon, walking distance from office at Changi business park
5
Very Nice South Indian Food and taste is exactly the same as if you are having food at Sarvan Bhavan in India.....must go and have food there..
4
Saravana Bhavan is very famoue in Chennai India, the same taste has been replicated in Singapore too. The service quality is good and good value for money.
4
Mini Meal, Dosai, Uttappam!!!!!!!!!!! Simple Awesome.....
One must visit this restaurant to have great South Indian & pure Vegetarian food.
4
It was lovely getting Indian food at Singapore. The food was fresh and wholesome and reminded me of home
4
Saravana Bhavan has a lot to offer in South Indian platter. We love the masala doses and one is never enough for us. There are long queues waiting outside and at times, we have to leave the place after 20-30 minutes waiting. Must try-dosa and coffe
1
HSB is one name which beats everyone hands down in south Indian food, this is my personal experience after staying in chennai for 16 yrs. But the one at Singapore was a disgrace on the name. I felt horrible eating ice cold mendu wada and hard idlis. The sambar was cold and horrible. Definitely a mistake to visit this place
5
Same as ever. Trustworthy, same taste and go with a blind eye.
No problems whatsoever and do room delivery too.
What more can one want in an alien land!!!
3
This restaurant is good for Indians visiting singapore and want to have good food but less on pocket. It offers south meals (just like south meals in india) for $7-8 and your tummy will be full with it.
5
A good alternative to daily punjabi daal roti. This is though one of the most common food in singapore, when we talk about Indian food.
4
Good Veg. food & very good service.
The Thalis are excellent and very stuffy for the whole day. would be please to recommend to my group.
2
Just Ordered Dosa. The taste, ambience cleaniness was pathetic, so decided to levae the place for ever
5
Nice restaurant tucked in Little India.
Awesome traditional banana leaf meal.
Superb chicken, fish and prawn dishes.
Tea and lime juice - out of this World.
Prices affordable.

Better buck up on your service or else get ready to lose ur customers!!!! Food very expensive.. Not worth at all.. Spicy garden which is just right the corner... Serves so much better and their prices are reasonable as well...
2
Small place. Very badly maintained. Nobody served water in spite of
requesting 3 times. Food OK. Prices reasonable. Nobody cleaned table and below the table where food was leftover.
3
Had dinner here. Good thing is service is real quick.
Far more Pricey than the Murugan Idli shop nearby. Chappathi was real thin for the price! Ordered coffee which came back.... cold! The fare did little justice to the Brand name. Avoid it!
4
Out of all the other restaurants I tried, Sarvana Bhavan was the best & clean. Since i also dine at the same restaurant in Delhi situated at Jan-path, i can say the taste was close to what i eat here. For other the taste was not even close. Like Ananda bhavan another Indian restaurant having 3 branches in the same area but the taste was not very much satisfactory
5
I was satisfied, Had Indian meal after long. I was happy to have my kindaa food. Loved it. hygienically prepared.
You can shop as well in the little India around. Taxi's are available as you move out on the streets.
5
A small but heaven for people who love South Indian Food. I little expensive though... but worth-it..
Good Service.. Neat and tidy place to eat.
5
Has the same old HSB quality as Chennai. Seating space was an issue in the evening on a weekday. So I am sure it can get quite busy on weekends.
Compared to Chennai HSB, I found this more reasonable!
5
The food was excellent and the service great. Would recommend it to one and all. Every time we went there there was a waiting time be it for lunch or dinner. So if you planning to go there keep about 15-20 minutes at hand.
2
I had ordered for some south indian food.. The dosa was too sour.. The sambar had mix of the kootu, Appam was sour.. Prepared with dosa batter.. The Mysore bond was deep fried multiple times and was tough to break it into two.. Please opt for other restaurants..
1
This is a famous chain but the outlet in question has put the name to shame. Went there for dinner and as usual there was waiting. But the issue was:1. Rude and impolite manager2. Order taken for different dishes and delivered on table different. When asked to staff, cool reply - food/stock over. Absolute discourteous3. The table was not cleaned properly despite repeated attempts. Very wet floor, stinking and unkempt bathroom4. Food, the less spoken the better - horrible stuffing (red coloured potato weird stuffing in dosa), tasteless. Sambhar and chutney when requested for repeat, ignored.Go for better options in the neighboure
4
Saravana Bhavan, like Murugan Idly, is consistently good across all locations all over the globe. One knows what to expect, and one gets it. Authentic south Indian cuisine with no frills, no pretensions, finger licking good at very reasonable prices. Saravana Bhavan has an edge over Murugan in terms of the ambience and service, but the idlis are far better at Murugan. In fact at 9.30 in the morning, when I went there for tiffin breakfast, they did not have any regular idlis, just the mini idlis. Even though they are probably made from the same batter, the regular idlis taste much better. The ghee roast masala dosa is out of the world as usual. The appam was good too along with avail
3
I had high expectations but was disappointed with Saravana bhavan. Poor service. No system of tracking customer orders. People who came late were served earlier than the seated customers.Place is not Hygenic. Food taste is average. If you have a choice look for some other one in the vicinity.Price is pretty low which is the only positive point
1
Saravana bhavan used to be a best place for having south indian food. Currently the service has gone from bad to worse. There is no body manning the queue and people just jump off the queue while others are waiting. With lack of seating space and poor service, I would recommend switching to other restaurants nearby
1
I ordered for aloo palak (potato with spinach) with the manager who took my order, but I was served something else. When I pointed this out to the manager, he insisted he did not make a mistake. He first argued saying that I had repeated the order twice so he couldn't have got it wrong. Next moment he said I repeated the order thrice. He just made things up up along the way. We just walked up and left. I've eaten at their KL joint and the food was top notch South Indian food. Shame the service was so atrocious in the Little India joint
4
You need to visit this place to devour the sambar and rasam with rice! Very authentic. I like the side dishes too. But nothing in front of the former :)
5
one of the best places to have south indian dinning experience in singapore. The Idli and dosa served here are really yummy and the meals is a good option to try if you are really hungry.
4
Went in for brunch on 28th April, thoroughly enjoyed the dosas and the filter coffee simply yummy. The service was great specially loved the sambar.
4
We has saravana special meals and it was worth the money. Food was very good and affordable price. Would recommend it for sure.
4
if you are in singapore and looking for a south indian meal then saravana bhuvan is the place to be. the lady who is managing the restaurant is very kind and managing restaurant well. during lunch time it is full house.they need to give some importance to hygeine, rest is ok
4
I accidentally discovered Saravanaa Bhawan during one of my earlier trips to Singapore. Being an Indian, and vegetarian, one tends to seek out for basic cuisine outside hotel meals and club lounges once in a while. Saravanaa Bhawan just fits the bill for those moments. No frills but tasty food. Basic hygiene but good prices. Plastic furniture but prompt service. The restaurant I visited this time was in little india near mustafa and had to wait for about fifteen minutes before we got to be seated. Order taking and service was prompt, considering they had people waiting. Food was hot and tasty and portion size quite reasonable. Six of us completed our meal in less then 20 minutes. At an average of SGD 7 per person, it's a good value for money affair. Worth visiting while here. Asked them if they deliver - no, said the manager - Disappointed on this on
1
Nothing good hereHygiene very poor. There is no difference between staff who is cleaning and serving. Worst they clean the table and without washing hands serve food to next table.Price too high.Portions served very lessService is pathetic. Staff just want to get rid of you ASAP so serving is super fast and equally fast is their pressure for your next order. If you are not planning to order more even before you finish your plates are taken and bills on the table. Motive get more people in so that they can make profit. Taste is the only saving grace. However there are other good players around so one need not go here for quality alone.Verdict - avoid this nonsense place and try anand bhavan or komalas near ferrer park.
1
I went to Saravana Bhavan ( SB) on 12 April and felt same experience as last time in Jan 14. It is very poor in hygiene, AC was not working, floor was very dirty. Had meal and curd served was so sour that no human could have eaten. Manager is a nice man but offer no improvement. I would strongly recommend avoiding. I was told that SB is far better than Komala Vilas.
4
The brand carries considerable expectations as most of their outlets whether in India, Canada, or the UAE serve excellent food. This one's no different. They have an extensive menu, are reasonably priced, offer well-sized portions, and friendly service. Whether it's the Naan-subzi, idli-dosa, or the more fusion Kothu parotta kind of food, they're always on the button. And, the filter coffee is amazing! It can get noisy at times, but it's well worth it
5
Recently i taste the food of saravanaabhavan at singapore,it taste good in this restaurant we dont miss our traditional taste,special lunch ,rawa dosa ,adai avial & i tried chat items too its spicy & crispy.great south indian restaurant were ever we go search for the name for good south indan food
3
A good place that serves south indian food but lacks on quantity. Try Rawa Masala Dosa/Thosai for sure. and top it up with filter coffee.
5
Amongst various Indian restaurants in Singapore, one can find the best authentic vegetarian south Indian food in this place, courteous staff, tasty & delicious food, wide variety of items including uncommon items like adai which are also served for those who are in search of
4
The food quality is good and they serve quick. The waiters are very polite , The manager is always with a smile . The food everywhere in Singapore is expensive here u get value for money.
5
Amazing food, you will not miss India for one bit. Excellent value for money, multiple locations in singapore choose well

Great south indian meals & food very near to the Veerakaliamman temple. Good filter cofee here. Pure vegetarian.
5
Excellent food with excellent value and coffees are great too. Been here twice this visit and had the biryani. Be back for more.

we enjoyed the delicious south indian vegetarian food here. Mostly had dinner here during our visit. A good place to enjoy a meal it is quite busy.

I have been to Saravan Bhavan in Chennai and the US... But this one was the most disappointing. I went there for dinner last month and the taste of the meals that I had ordered was pretty average (to say the least).

A maut visit place for authentic South Indian Meal. It's crispy doses, soft idlis, filter coffee and paneer 65 are the regular items that we eat..it's ver reasonable and the service is very good.

I used to visit this place until recently when a couple of incidents during my meal irked me. My food was served with a dead fly in the chutney. When I asked them to change the plate, they just emptied the chutney and got me the same plate. Upon raising my tone, they changed the plate. When my tea was served, there was another dead fly in it. I just got up and left and I'll never return to this garbage infested place. My suggestion is that people stop visiting this place so that they shut shop

If you want to try very good and authentic south indian food specially Idlis, head for this place next to Mustafa shopping centre of Serangoon Road, Singapore.
Plenty of choice of Idlis and Dosas and coffee is the icing on cake !!!

Excellent south indian food, same taste as the one in Chennai outlet, not very expensive and has lots of varieties.

If you would like a Indian meal then please visit this place. They are open till late in the night, and everything is served quickly with good quality.Here I asked for lemon tea with my meal. Although its not on the menu, the staff made black tea and gave me lemon slices, so I can mix it. (many places would not do this).Really liked going there, and its right oppo Mustafa :-

This review is for the Robinson Road restaurant. The prices are great and food is good. Good to go a bit early if going for lunch. If you get a little bit late, you might not find seating or you will find seating all the way inside right next to the kitchen. I also went on a weekend but this was closed. Syed Alwi restaurant is open on the weekends
5
I came here with a friend of mine and I must say that the recommendation which he provided was spot on. The food here is fresh and really tasty. Fantastic food and at reasonable prices. I had the aloo gobi and vegetable makhanwala which were very very good. Highly recommend to try
4
This is a good value for money place if you want to have a good south Indian breakfast. Their dosas are good especially their paper masala dosai. Their variety of coconut and tomato based chutneys never fails......service may be a bit slow sometimes but by and large this place always lives up to your expectations. Idlis are better at Murugan's though...

Desmond ordered the Ghee Roast Masala Dosa which he devoured in about 5 minutes. Rusky and I had the Mini Tiffin which was excellent. In fact, the food was so good that we all ordered more! I also enjoyed the coffee which even though was sweet (and I don't do sugar in my coffee) was very strong and tasty. Desmond (from Chennai) commented that the food was as good as the food in Madurai and I'm looking forward to my next visit to Singapore (Jan 2014) to visit here again

Well, it is to be expected that Saravana Bhavan would maintain their standard in all their restaurants. The Singapore restaurant doesnt dissapoint. Only the range is slightly limited and number of people to attend are less, so service is slightly slower. Prices are high but they are in India as well
4
It was good to find an Indian Restaurant in vicinity of our hotel in Singapore ...Was as per expectation ..Had visited its outlet in New Delhi (Cannaught Place)Good for South Indian Food ..Thali is fulfilling ...Though its bit costly ... nothing like to have indian food and take a break from local food of the country ..will be looking forward to visit Saravana Bhawan in other countries as well
4
Authentic and tasty. This restaurant is a boon for people who would like to have curd rice to beat the heat of Singapore. At least that is what I did. I was desperately looking for curd rice and this is where I got it. The dosas and idlis were good too
4
I used to go to the place near raffles mrt as it was close to my office. Sadly it's closed recently.
Clean cheap tasty food. Specially the South Indian food! U could easily finish a meal for two with 15-20 sgd.
5
During visit to Singapore you find a lovely place named little India, a lot of Indian food varieties are available, but you may miss quality. as soon as you reach this rest your search for good food is over. prices are reasonable.
5
Had my best veg south Indian food during my travel! The staff was helpful and the food was just amazing! The meal was piping hot and absolutely divine. Strongly recommend having food here.
4
The chain is pretty popular in South India. Hence I chose to have dinner at this place. Food was good and tasty, ambiance of the restaurant is nice. Just in front of Mustafa centre.
4
We went there for our breakfast the food selection was good and it is very tasty we all enjyed the food. Comparing the other places around the food is good and cheaper. Try dosa it is nice
4
Saravanaa Bhavan is one of several vegetarian restaurants in Little India, and its proximity to Mustafa's makes it a convenient refuelling stop, park in Mustafa's ( street parking almost impossible), do your shopping, then walk across to Saravanaa. The restaurant is quite bright and spacious compared to some others, service is patchy, but the food is above average. Can not comment about the coffee as I only have coffee at Komala Vilas
3
The part I liked was it reminded me chennai ambience with lot of Tamil people .But the food especially all dosa varieties were not at all hot as it is in chennai.even coffee also not up to the mark.But the lunch was satisfactory.delivering time for each order was so long & one must have so much patience as Singaporeans 
4
We were living at Hotel V Lavender & Little India was close by. During evening we went to Little India in seach for a restaurant where we can get India food & we found Saravanaa Bhavan there. Very simple restaurant with not much of pomp & show but food was good & had good number of options available. Whenever we got a chance we visited Little India & our place to eat was this joint. What I liked about this joint was its food at resonable price.Overall it was nice place

I went to Saravana Bhavan in Singapore last month with the family. Even though the food was of the quality of the better restaurants in Singapore, I was not convinced it is a branch of Saravana Bhavan of Chennai. One thing they are surely maintaining is the price. It is costly and it is at least 1.5-2 times costlier than a comparable restaurant in Singapore.  The following are my doubts about whether this is geniene are not. 1. The main colour someone would find in Saravana bhavan is Blue, whereas here it is Green 2. The name is spelt different. 3. The food taste is not the same. 4. The main attraction of Chennai Saravana Bhavan is its Appam, whereas this one’s Appam is not of a great standard. But other than the confusion of the name, the food and taste is ok for a normal restaurant, But the only question who would want to pay double the price for the same quality of food. It is situated very close to Mustafa, so people going there keep thronging the place, the service is not great , the waiters are not kind enough , so all in all, even if I don’t have anything to eat, would prefer to eat bread and Jam rather than go through this experience again .

The food was nice but we were expecting more. Located very close to Mustafa shopping center. We had been for lunch and found the food quiet average. I have been to Sarvana Bhavan in Paris which was far far better in terms of the ambience and choice of food
4
I tried this place just in front of the 4th Exit of Mustafa and the food was delicious, although the service was slow. It is worth having food here.
3
We ordered North Indian thali and South Indian utappa , utappa was good but North Indian was not up to the mark
4
Here is a no fuss eatery that serves pure vegetarian south indian meals in singapore.
Would I go again? Well, here is the answer - I spent 20 Singapore Dollars on taxi for a 6 singapore dollar meal - and would gladly do it again!
4
Good, neat and clean hotel. Staff were very friendly. The unlimited meals were the best. The meal were not very spicy or hot.
4
Great place to have a quick South Indian bite if you're tired of shopping at Mustafa. Simple ambience and value-for-money.
4
I have been to this restaurant many a times and have tasted all most all the items in their Menu Card. I recommend this restaurant for a South Indian cuisine rather than a North Indian one. If you happen to go on Friday Evenings, not to miss Adai Avial one of my favourite in Saravana Bhavan. Avoid Keima Idly as it is too oily. Over all I would say more plus than minus

I visited this place with my Wife as she wanted to have South Indian as its her favorite and she had crossed this place many times so she wanted to check it out.....Time was around 2.15pm on a weekday.....On the first look everything seems to be gr8.....the boards display good view of food in nice clean disposable plates....The lady at the counter greeted and took the order...We placed order of Veg Pulav as that was special for the day and Chana Bhatura.Staff people were having lunch at the last seats clearly indicating that they have just finished serving lunch....Very few people there having lunch.....Our order came in steel plates for which i was surprised as they didn't looked as much clean as one always expect...Delivery person was looking least bothered that how he was placing plates on table ......Also since we were sitting facing kitchen door which was open....we can easily see that no one in there was wearing gloves and covering hairs. They seems to be using hands to place food in plates which was a surprise as an eatery with chains around the world having such low hygiene standards. Secondly quantity of food was nothing as shown in pics.....and would be termed as pricey as of what was delivered.....One big Bhatura was delivered...who in the world serves one bhatura..!! No one in India i think....!!! People from Delhi like me might wanna protest for this...Just Kidding.... :-)Most of the people had Thali's there and i might guess its becoz of low quantity of food in single items ordered...May be they serve other better dishes but to be true...even a single dish is enough to ruin customer base.At least they lost me as a customer....I would advise to improve hygiene standards or at least keep the door closed so others might not know whats going on inside....Serve quantity as shown in Boards and in same disposable plates.....

Saravana Bhavan is a very well known brand of south indian food, particularly in tamil nadu, India.The place is basic and service is quick, and if you love south indian food, then this would be heaven for you.The idlis, vada, dosa, uthapam and upma were all fantastic. And the taste of the sambhar was wonderful.Pricing is low so its great on the affordability factor as well, and its right next to mustafa market

We dined at Merchant Street one(This restaurant have three locations in Singapore).It took us long time to reach there from Raffles place subway station asking several people in vain but succeeded finally asking an Indian Singaporean or an Indian gentleman naturally.The reason why I especially tried to take my wife there is because I liked this restaurant very much when I visited India on business trip. As this restaurant offers south Indian dishes, I wanted to eat in Madras but had no time. Instead I did in Delhi. In India it was very clean ,the dishes were tasty and inexpensive and many people were there in line. in Singapore though , the place was so ordinary(not so clean but not so dirty neither just average) and very few guests at noon time (total 5 including me and my wife). However I could enjoy similar taste and inexpensive dish there as well as in India so I am more than happy to go there on second chance

This is opposite Mustafa center .Its small and cramped and at times there is a waiting line ,don't expect to have a nice cup of tea and a long chat ,it's noisy and people tend to wait next to you to hurry your meal and leave so they can occupy your table .But if you are extremely hungry and don't want to venture far do visit this joint.The food is very pricey I am comparing it to the chain in Malaysia , just average ,watch out for the saltiness and oiliness if you are health conscious.Had the mushroom briyani,idli and kurma paneer was okay but the oiliness was such a put off for me and not to mention the lack of paneer in the kurma .I guess I was the only foreigner there as the rest were Indian nationals from India who favor a vegetarian fare
2
The food is overpriced & not good at all. I ordered the punjabi thali which was just horrible just as the case with my friend's order. Have had food at chennai but this place sucks.
3
Not as good as in India, but not bad either. Decently priced, as compared to the others in the same category. The food is quite alright. Lacks in ambiance.
3
Saravana bhavan is not that much great as it is in chennai... too expensive and not worth for the penny we spend.... those who come for saravana bhavan's taste will be disappointed....
5
Saravana Bhawan is also one of best Indian restaurant in Singapore with lot of choice of Indian food with excellent service. Quality of food and test of food is best.
4
Great location beside Mustafa. Good food great price and choices of food are great. taste is authentic
3
This place is opposite mustafa centre. A really cramped place. The food is average and service is slow. The food is not really comparable to sarvana bhavan india outlets. But the place gives a good veg option for tourist and locals looking for south indian food.
4
The place is small, and while the food was not upto the standards of Saravana Bhavan in Chennai, it was pretty good nevertheless. We had paneer dosas and onion bajjis which were good. The coffee - true South Indian served in stainless steel tumblers was perfect
4
I really enjoyed this restaurant. Easy to read menu with lots of choices. The curries were less complex, still very flavorful, just not 10+ different spices in each dish. Potato curry had just chilies, onion, tumeric, mustard and cumin, no garam masala. I felt satisfied but my tastebuds weren't totally confused which seems to happen at some Indian places. :) It is a bit more expensive than most of the other restaurants in the area that have a similar decor and menu. Single story can be crowded, we had to wait a bit but it was worth it
4
I have visited singapore for 02 days, and was really confused about veg restaurant. But then I found this restaurant in the heart of area called Little India in Singapore. This restaurant offers variety of Indian foods, for lunch I would highly recommend you to go for a set meal, and it is cost just a SGD 10. Morning masala tea is soo soo good for refreshing day
3
Though the traditional mini idli with the ghee flavored sambar was good, would have appreciated it to be on par with what we have in India. Had ordered puri too, which was good enough.The crowd on the weekends keeps u waiting for your order but worth the wait
