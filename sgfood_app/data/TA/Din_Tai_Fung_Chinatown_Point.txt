You can go there if you like to eat in a shopping mall with no alcool with your dinner. The only alcool on the menu were 2 types of small bottle of beer each priced at 11$.

Very famous reataurant and no need to comment about the taste. The service is rather good and very goo location.
3
Had I picked the right restaurant? Tried and tested. Service was ok . Food was mediocre. Dumpling were much better at the hawkers stall at fraction of the price. Overall I wouldn’t recommend it.
5
Tasty food, simply but beautifully served. It lasted for about five minutes each time a plate arrived at the table!

Review by Dr Sim. Food is generally good. Service is slow and average because of the crowded. Very crowded and noisy. Ok for tourist to drop by to eat but be prepared for long queues. Regards Dr Sim

I went to the restaurant early in the morning when there were only few guests. After I left there was a long line of people queuing, which means this place is very popular (not sure if the ppl are local or tourists). High prices are expectable in Singapore, but we'd expected more in the food. I ordered 1 beef noodle, 1 shrimp & pork dumplings. The noodle soup was good and different to me as I'd never tried that dish before, but the beef still had that "frozen in the fridge" smell, though it was tender and moist, which upset me and my friends. The dumpling wrap were nice and thin, the shrimps tasted frozen as expected... The chilli oil contained just oil, unlike in other restaurants where it is made with dried shrimps and scallops. I was confused but maybe if I'd asked, they would've brought me other chilli oil?! Total bill is around > $21 and its not worth it.

日本語の口コミの後、英語の口コミもあります。 English review follows Japanese.ディンタイフォンは、世界的に人気のある小籠包屋さんです。 いろんな中華もあります。シンガポールには多くの支店があることは幸いです。 実際には台湾料理ですが、シンガポールに来るたびにディンタイフォンに行ってください。 どのレストランが最高の小籠包をだすかは意見の分かれる問題ですが、ほぼ毎回小籠包は柔らかく、ジューシーで、美味しいスープでいっぱいです。この支店はチャイナタウンMRT駅の近くのチャイナタウンポイントにあります。 良い点は、ディンタイフォンだということです。 また、われわれが見つけたこの支店は、オーチャードロード近くの支店より少し混んでいる。 私たちは少し待っていて、サービスはかなり速かった。唯一の欠点は、彼らがメニューに蒸した牛肉スープがなかったということでした。これは私たちのお気に入りです。 それが食べたかったら、パラゴンセンターの支店に行く必要があります（早く行く！）。Din Tai Fung is our favourite xiao long bao (steamed dumplings) restaurant worldwide, although it has other Chinese dishes on the menu. It's fortunate that there are many branches in Singapore. Even though it's actually a Taiwanese cuisine, we make sure to go to a Din Tai Fung every time we come to Singapore. Which restaurant has the best xiao long bao is a matter of opinion, but nearly every time we come the xiao long bao are soft, juicy, and full of delicious soup.This branch is in Chinatown Point near Chinatown MRT station. The good point is that it's Din Tai Fung. Also, this branch we found is a bit less busy than branches near Orchard Road. We had only a short wait, and service was quite quick. The only down side was that they didn't have the steamed beef soup on the menu, which is our favourite. You'll have to go to the branch in Paragon center for that (go early!)

I live in Hong Kong where there are a couple of restaurants of this same chain. But I was feeling like giving it a go in Singapore where I have seen a lot of these same restaurants. Excellent deep fried won tons and excellent steamed dim sum. I believe this is here a lot more expensive than HK, and they don´t have wine or sparkling water, but this is a place where you cannot go wrong
3
I tried this place for a short lunch time break. I got there with Singaporean friend (Chinese) who scored the food quality as very good. I had to agree. I enjoyed the food variety and taste. If around Chinatown I would suggest as safe port to rest
4
We ordered dumplings and duck pancakes (or duck in some kind of pastry?). We had tea to drink which they refilled regularly. Service was friendly, food was slow to come out but it was busy. Food- so good. The dumplings were fresh and dainty with the finest pastry (?). Would have ordered more but it was near closing time and they had taken ages to come out.
4
Lovely dim sum! Clear concept and good food. Definitely a good option to visit, but dont expect a romantic dinner....
3
The area is with good deco, service is fast and some good food like dumplings,prawn and pork.
Need improvement in they're veg menu and the way they cook (e.g. not to my taste)
5
After one day travel, i chose this to finish my day. The food are delicious, nice staffs. The price is ok
5
Din Tai Fung in Melbourne is one of our favourites for dumplings especially and the egg rice with crispy chicken. While in China Town Singapore, we stopped by and decided to have a late afternoon snack of their pork dumplings. The quality and taste were consistent with our expectations and we really enjoyed them with a beer. Interesting the their Dumpling Gems that we love in Australia are not on the menu in Singapore. While we did not try anything else on the menu this time I am sure all the offerings would be to a high standard.Really love Din Tai Fung.
5
My local friends and myself came here for dinner tonight.There is a great range of Dim Dum and Noodle dishes as well as many appetisers and desserts.The three of us really enjoyed Steamed Chilli Crab Xiao Long Bao - on the menu until 31 Aug 17.Other dishes we had were: Steamed Pork Dumplings, Steamed Vegetable &  Pork Dumplings, Oriental Salad in Special Vinegar Dressing, Oriental Wontons with Black Vinegar & Chilli Oil plus special fried rice and two or three other dishes - all were great. Service was prompt, luckily we didn't have to wait long to be seated - overall an excelled meal in a nice setting - recommended if you are near Chinatown Point
4
We visit Din Tai Fung almost everywhere we go. The food never disappoints. Once again we've ordered shrimp, chicken, pork and even vegetarian options. The ice tea we ordered came with an enormous ball of ice that was tea as well. They were very late with our side order but oh well. The food is good and that's what matters
4
This one doesn't have the ambiance of other Din Tai Fung restaurants, but the food is still superb, service excellent & location is convenient. Truffle dumplings good but regular selection is delicious anyway. No wine list but emphasis here is on the food, which is really, really good.
4
Food was yummy as always! Customer service I would rate a 3/5. Was waiting for ages at the front counter and no one came up to us for a long time. Can never fault the food, always tasting so good! Price is quite reasonable for a restaurant compared to markets. Will always come back here to eat.

Din Tai Fung is a chain of restaurants found in several Asian countries with a number of outlets in Singapore. We went to this one on the second level of a shopping centre in Chinatown on New Bridge Road, Singapore.It is a Taiwan based company and the food is based on Taiwan cuisine and is very similar to Yum Cha styles - much of it made up from small, steamed delicacies.We enjoyed the food but were not overjoyed with it. Flavours were delicate rather than strong and the prices were quite high compared to many other similarly set up restaurants in Singapore. Having said that, the Chinese Tea was outstanding.Ordering is simple. Each table has a pad showing each item on the menu and its price. You tick the ones you want and it is taken away to the kitchen. Service was fairly fast and friendly
3
I was looking forward to some great dumplings but was fairly disappointed - the chicken was flavorless and the prawn and pork only slightly better. Service was quick and we were in and out in a flash, sadly the food was very average. I ate at their Sydney branch when I got home and it was much better.
5
Come here for a quick lunch after travel for hold morning. Multiply choice for dimsum. Price is acceptable
4
We had our farewell & welcome lunch her for 3 of our Japanese colleagues. They love the food here! Dim sum, noodles, fried rice, vegetables, dessert.
Will surely come again on my own.
5
Had dinner here last night. Chosen because of the number of people inside and waiting to get inside! Also interesting to watch the chefs preparing the steamed buns. We played it very safe just opting for pork buns, egg fried rice and a green vegetable but we loved it. Interesting way food is ordered and then delivered to table separately. And their lemon earl grey iced tea a real winner. Not too pricey either. Will definitely go back with friends and be more adventurous!
5
We came here for lunch on a weekday and had fast service and good, hot food. The drinks were very tasty, and the food options ranged in flavors, all for a very low price for the middle of Singapore. We had fun at the end watching them make the soup dumplings through a viewing window. Clean, quiet, and consistent

Din Tai Fung is very famous for their dimsum, especially Xiao Long Bao. I had lunch at its branch at China Point, in China Town. It's really crowded during meal time and you can see a long queue in front. Let's go to the front desk, get a ticket and wait for being arranged. They will give you a paper menu, so that you can choose during the waiting time. You can have a look at the cooks preparing the dimsum from outside, through the class window. I ordered shrimp wanton with chicken broth, Xiao Long Bao as their signature dish, and steamed papaya. I went alone so I was arranged the seat really quick (10 mins I think), you will need to wait longer if you have big group. They provide a small chair for women to keep the bags as well, very convenient. The Xiao Long Bao was served really quick, it was good but not so significant. I preferred shrimp wanton, the shrimp was fresh, well marinated; the wanton was thin and with good texture. They went well with the chicken broth. Noted that the broth is so little that I wished they should give more. The steamed papaya was a little sweet for me, you can find other ingredients inside, but I cannot say what exactly they are. It will release the hot weather, for sure. I strongly recommend the shrimp wanton with chicken broth. The price is high, it cost me ~S$35 for all above with a coke. Will come back again, as it's worth a try

Very busy - always a good sign - with queues waiting to get in. Unusual method of choosing your food before you go to your table, but it works. Take care with the sweet and sour soup - small is fine; regular is for 2 to 3 people. Excellent dim sum - we had vegetarian and and pork/shrimp
4
In the Chinatown shopping complex. Had to wait for about twenty minutes, but they give you a menu sheet to look at and complete and a number. Just wait for your number to come up on the electronic board and you're in. Nice range of appetisers and dumplings with rice and noodle dishes. All freshly made. You can watch them do it and so long as you don't mind which order they come in, then a good experience
1
It is a very bad service that I met! Firstly, I queue at what they were mentioned at the signage there, but then one of the staff ask me is it one dine in or not, I told her that I just take away then she ask me to wait at outside there(so I just follow what she said). Continue, another female staff saw me and said I should come in front of the counter not outside there (ok, fine). After, I done my order and waiting them to prepare, the female staff told me to sit at one of the sitting area but not mention where can sit where couldnt sit, so I saw there are many empty seats so I just choose one of it to sit and she come and told me that place are not allow to sit which she pointed me on the priority seat(means for disable persons, elderly or pregnant women) there ask me to sit. Then, I decided not to sit because made me felt that you are making fun on me. I will never ever come to this restaurant again and strongly not recomment others to come this restaurant
4
Visited here after visiting the Hong Kong & Macau restaurants a number of times. The food was good here however not has good as the other branches we have been to. The staff where less friendly than the other restaurants and instead of getting a pot of tea on your table you was giving a small cup which was re filled when the waiter got to your table again.
5
We ate here twice during a 10 day business trip. The second time we went back, we were taking another colleague from the U.S. who had just flown in from Kuala Lumpur. Turns out (unbeknownst to us) that he had eaten at the same restaurant in KL two times before flying to Singapore because he had liked it so much -- so he was obviously happy to hear that we wanted to take him there as well (this goes to show how awesome their food is). We also tried Century Eggs just for fun. Although I wouldn't crave them -- they weren't horrible and just tasted like eggs (despite their reputation). DTF service is good and prices are reasonable. If you love dim sum, you need to try it. If you order the soup dumplings, one thing I learned is that you're supposed to put it in your soup spoon and then puncture it. You can then eat it without burning your mouth on the soup in the dumpling. You then drink the juice from the spoon. This is not necessary if your dumplings aren't real hot. One last item, if you need to use the restroom, it is outside the restaurant, just down the hallway. Also, if you are a small group you do not need reservations
5
We have been to many Din Tai Fung ( Hong Kong and Toronto) and we have never been disappointed.
This one is as good as all the other ones.
Their dumplings are so fresh and juicy. We never get tired of them.
4
We had originally planned to go to another restaurant . Stopped in here and had a bowl of soup and tea. The soup was very, very good and the tea was plentiful ..
5
Any DTF is good in Singapore, but the most crowded is the Marina Bay Sands one. Really good value for money. I recommend to try all the dumplings (xiao long bao), and any kind of fried rice, they are amazing! And if you like spicy, try the spicy dumplings!
3
Now that Din Tai Fung has exploded into a mass franchise, I think their food has went down.While I don't question the quality and care they put into cooking them, it just isn't very tasty.The no's from what I had: hot and sour soup, 紅油抄手, special mushroom noodles.The yes's: the stirred fried pea tips with minced pork, 皮蛋 (very interesting savoury and vinegary sauce).Crab dumplings were too strong for me, but that's just a personal choice
4
Have visited different outlets many times. My LOs love their noodle and fried rice, especially the egg fried rice and mushroom and minced meat noodle. First time to the Chinatown outlet. Long queue but waiting time is reasonable. Also tried their prawn dumpling, good! Please remember to try their chilli with their noodle or rice, heavenly!
5
Went with a Chinese friend and thankfully he knew his way around the extensive dim sum menu. The dishes were superb and the service great. I had dim sum dishes I had never had before and left feeling very satisfied. A good evening and a restaurant I will return to.
5
Visited "DinTai Fung" several times at Marina Bay Singapore and 101 Taipei. This time at China Town Singapore. The dumplings they offer are so delicious and they deserve to be so famous. I had two plates- steamed vegetable and pork dumplings - steamed chicken dumplings For those who love dumplings this chain of restaurants is recommended
4
Love dumplings at Din Tai Fung. Could possibly eat here every day of the week. Been to so many of their locations now around the world I should probably have some kind of loyalty card going! Dining tip here: put the lid on your dumplings while eating to avoid them drying out from the air conditioning!
4
I suppose the wait here is shorter than other outlets as chinatown offers cheaper eat in the many eateries and restaurants located in this complex . I did not have to wait long (20 mins) for a seat as i did in Atria outlets (40 mins) which shopping complex is targetted at the upper segment and willing to spend $40 something for 2 trays of Xiao lung pau (XLP) and a stewed beef noodle.No regrets if you order the crab (XLP) pau and the noodles, both are very good choices

I had just arrived in Singapore and was staying at a hotel near Chinatown Point Mall. I had read that there was a Din Tai Fung restaurant in this mall so I decided to have a meal there as I was quite hungry.I arrived at the restaurant at 4 p.m. There was no queue and I was led straight away to a table. The restaurant was pretty empty with only a few tables being occupied, however I noticed that it did begin to fill up quite quickly over the next hour or so.The waitress brought me an order form to fill out and also brought a stand for me to place my bag on. A pot of Chinese tea was also placed on the table without me asking for it. I noticed that I was charged a couple of dollars for it when I went to pay.On a previous visit to Singapore I had enjoyed Pork Chop and Fried Rice at Din Tai Fung at the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes so I decided to order it again.It arrived pretty quickly, however it wasn't quite as nice as the one I had at Marina Bay as the pork had a more 'gamey' taste. The rice, however, was fine.The meal, Pork Chop and Fried Rice and pot of Chinese tea cost me S$16.41 in total
5
Clean, excellent taste, variety, fast, good service, well organised this restaurant of Taiwan origin.
3
over the years di tai fung branches in singapore have lost the quality touch, outlets are cold, no service and blend taste.
there is better options in singapore.
4
Great dinner, really good service and food. Had a 10 minute wait for a table but we're able to select our food and drinks while waiting.
5
come here last week saturday ... the food was awesome ... the xiao long bao is the best .... will be back there again for sure
5
Though same style completely the presentation and quality seemed better to us than the one in Orchard Road which we also enjoyed. So, this one gets higher marks.
5
Baing a massive Dim Sum fan , i juat wanted to try something the locals would have and this place ticked the box. Dim Sum range was great , also had some different fried rices which were all really good . Meal was priced well , and left happy and wanting more 
1
The service is awful people. You will wait to be placed (15min) to have someone to take your order (10min) And finally to have your food... the staff is more busy to talk to their friends than take care of the customers. This is a shame for Din Tao Fun
5
I went on a Sunday at 12:40pm and with a party of 2, was seated immediately without any queue. However, we noticed that a larger group (>4) that came earlier than us was still waiting for a table. For this outlet, do come in a smaller group if you want to be seated quick.I find the food at all outlets of Din Tai Fung in Singapore is always consistent. Have been to the original Din Tai Fung outlet in Taiwan and honestly, besides the longer wait I was not able to differentiate the quality of food... they are all equally good. For the two of us, we ordered the xiao cai, spinach, and 20 of the original xiao long bao. We were told that we had to wait 25 minutes for the xiao long bao but it came at ~10 mins after we ordered. What a pleasant surprise.For the xiao cai, it is a very good blend of seaweed, bean curd, bean sprouts, red chilli and mung bean noodles with vinegar. The seaweed, bean curd and red chilli were all julienned perfectly. This is the ideal appetizer to order while waiting for your xiao long bao. The original xiao long bao is as good as usual. The skin is thin yet thick enough to hold up the xiao long bao without breaking. You could taste and feel the gelatinous broth with the minced meat. The ginger is julienned very finely; we could clearly see that every detail had been put in to help make the xiao long bao dish perfect. Spinach is well seasoned and cooked. It is not soggy and still has a little crunch. It is also not greasy. A vegetable to order to balance with the meat in xiao long bao.Service is good as usual. They constantly come around to check and top up the tea.Final point. We noticed that by 1 pm, there was no longer any queue. This is probably the best time to come if you do not want to wait
5
The food was spot on and well worth it. We ate at the Chinatown point restaurant (others are across Singapore) and the food was very good standard at a reasonable price. If you look in the window to the right of the restaurant you can watch the cooks making the fresh dumplings. (If you are not going to eat there, its still fun to watch them making the dumplings). The restaurant seems to always be crowded but worth the wait for a table. Whilst waiting you can fill in your order so that once a table becomes available the wait for food is very short. The other aspect I like about this restaurant is that they give you an accurate estimate of waiting times and stick to it within a minute or two. If you do get a table immediately they will also tell you exactly how long it will be before your order will be fulfilled. Full points for service and keeping the customer informed
5
We've eaten much wonderful Chinese food, and the dim sum at Din Tai Fung was wonderful. The pork-stuffed chili peppers were particularly unique and delicious!Another review mentioned poor service. Our's simply required signaling our server. No big deal. We'd go back in a heart beat
5
Best dim sums in town at the Din Tai Fung places !
I can only recommend the pork dim sums and the crab ones!
Only bad point: the one in Chinatown is crazy with air con so its freezing cold in there !
3
The xiaolongboa is the best in Singapore. Other than this the other dishes are similar to what similar styled restaurants served. There is normally a queue for lunch and dinner so be prepared to wait for your table.
5
Dined here last night for dinner, it does get busy so expect to wait for a table. We ordered chicken & vegetable dumpling & the pork buns. Both were very fresh & quick. Could not fault.
5
...and other stuff. We have been there 3x within a week, based on our first visit and ratio price/quality. Every dish we ordered (soup, dumpling, vegetables, meat..) was well done.
5
I've visited Singapore on a few occasions & also return to this restaurant for its tasty dumplings, delicious lemongrass juice, best egg fried rice & many more delectable dishes! It's spotlessly clean, you can see the chefs busy at work making the dumplings! Staff are always friendly & very efficient!
3
The dumplings were alright, as was the noodles but I having eaten as the one in Sydney this fell a bit short by comparison. The service wasn't very good and waiters had to be waived down to get their attention.The mango pudding was definitely the highlight though
5
Unexpectedly went into the shopping mall and saw this place full and a small waiting line so we tried it. The wait was not even 5 minutes and we LOVED everything we tried. We actually ordered a 2nd time and left completely full, it was so good. Prices seem ok for Singapore. Staff is quick, very clean (gloves, hats, robes) and very efficient. Their business card shows they have 20 locations in sgn. I'm sure other dim sum places are great and probably better, but we really loved this one. And they have black truffle ones!
5
Chinatown is a very clean and big place, kids friendly, pram and wheelchair is accessible. Service is super fast and awesome, food serve fast too. Serve kids plates and even baby chair without even asking. Overall, the service made my experience very happy. My 19th months son is very happy eating there too. Maybe it is time for them to upgrade or introduce more other food as other restaurant is as competitive as din tai feng
5
Mom and me love to eat xiao long bao at this restaurant .The first time i know this restaurant in Paragon, but now the taste and also the serving time in Paragon much more longer than in Chinatown as my experience last year, even not at peak hour, their serving time in Paragon very long and the taste also not good. That is why, if mom want eat xiao long bao, i will bring her to Chinatown branch than to Paragon even Paragon more closer for us for dining

3 of us spent S$61.40 at lunch on 27/March/2016.Our 2 noodle dishes were nothing to shout about. The siew mai made the machine made Kong Guan regular seem fantastic. The siew loong pau could have been more delicate and less flourly.The bak chang type dumpling came - after repeated reminders...just as we all had finished our meal. We had a foldable laundry-bag type container to plant our handbags. It was then covered with a nicely pressed napkin. A nice touch.As we had waited for the bak chang.... that came lately... and were in a hurry... we handed our credit card to the wait staff to process payment. He said we have to do so at the cashier's counter.If only he had gone that extra mile ( a mile for him... an inch from my point of view).To strive consciously to serve greatly. Now, wouldn't that be something.This restaurant group seems to have garnered Michelin acclaim in 2014, and proudly flaunt it on their business card (readily available at the cashier's counter at the outlet's entrance). That makes them fair game in my sight
4
These restaurants are always full, but don't let this deter you from visiting. Nice food with reasonable prices. Very professional everyone in the staff.
5
Stop by for bags every time i visit Singapore, always very yummy. My parents also love the taste. This time I try chilli pork, that's good too.
5
Fab dumpling restaurant, near Parkroyal on Pickering. Tasty food and not too expnsive. They stuffed our order up but we didnt care as the wontons they brought in error were super delicious. Recommended to us by local chinese, it was delicious
5
Watched them making the dulling as you order, you can't get fresher than that, spicy crab dumpling are so delist, all the dumplings where first class, do yourself a favour and go here.
5
The restaurant bills its award winning Michelin chef and the food lives up to it. The dumplings are so moist and do not lose out to more expensive locations. We loved esp. Chili and vinegar pork. $64 for lunch for 4. Awesome.
4
Only had to queue a short time on the eve of CNY. The restaurant was busy and noisy, but the food is consistently good and tasty.
5
We enjoyed a quick lunch at Din Tai Fung Chinatown on a Monday during our holiday to Singapore. We were doing the hop-on hop-off city tour and this was near one of the stops. There was no wait for a table as we were a party of 2. We hadn't been here before but had read the reviews. We ordered pork dumplings, wantons, oriental salad and stir fried kailan - all delicious! You write your order on a paper order form and give it to a waiter when you're ready. As they bring each dish, they tick it off. Came to about SG$45 which we thought was reasonable value for the quality of the food. Would definitely go back.
5
We called for a late lunch and it was still busy.The food here is very good and the Pork Dim Sum was something else.We did struggle a bit with not many of the staff speaking English and we got a dish that we never ordered but it did not matter as it was all so tasty and at a reasonable price.When we were there the restaurant was full of locals and we were possible the only Europeans there, so if its used by the locals that has to be a good sign
4
The dumplings, drunken chicken and rice were very good. Great variety on the menu , value for money.Service was a little slow and not very friendly. I know Singapore is very business -like and profit conscious but does it cost you to smile?!! This attitude spoiled -- a little bit --- an otherwise good experience
5
We had an appreciated team dinner with steamed prawn dumplings, noodles with spicy sauce, veggies and beer. I have visited Din Tai Fung in Singapore before, both this one and the one in Paragon, and I will certainly return here again. To me it seems like Din Tai Fung takes pride in providing authentic chinese dumplings and noodles with good quality. My recommendations. Try to request for a table next to the show kitchen - then you can watch the chefs in action when they prepare noodles and dumplings
5
I love this place for their speciality, the steamed buns (Xiaolongbao). The service was quick and without any problems. The prices are reasonable.
5
No wonder this restaurant is always full!!! Came by around 4pm, and much to our delight, we were immediately given a table.... GREAT dimsum!!!! Good service, price okay for the great food and service!!!! Must go to place!!!!
5
We went to have lunch there due to a friend's recommendation and boy we liked it so much that we went a second time. Absolutely delicious soups and dim sun. Could not have enough of it so I definitely recommend it.
5
We had the most delicious food at this place bang in the heart of Singapores Chinatown !! The dimsums with soup inside them were divine.
4
Eating in the mall is never a favourite of mine but it was convenient so we stopped for lunch. Service was not very fast as we sat for while waiting for our order to be taken. The menu is extensive and the setting is a large and open space that is functional. Speed of service apart the food was good and more than adequate at the price. Overall not bad at all
3
This is famous restaurant chain in Taiwan, and we tried this in their Singapore location.The food quality is okay, but not as good as we expected. The price is a little bit over price compare to other foods in Singapore.I like the one in Taipei better
4
Food: The restaurant is famous for the dimsum, pork buns, (aka xiaolingbao). If you're not sure what to get on the menu, then look for the purple picture/icon of 'chef's recommendation' on the photo menu.Price/Servings: Servings are a little on the small side. Our family of 2 adults and 1 child paid $75 for dinner. Our kid prefers plain food, and enjoyed both the rice with prawns and the plain noodles.Service: English is a second language to the wait staff. By chinese standards they are not rude.Getting there: When you arrive at the mall, you'll see the Din Tai Fung logo on the outside of the building. Don't walk down the steps, because down that is a different restaurant that serves traditional: chicken feet, pork intestines, and other such delicacies. Go inside the mall building, and Din Tai Fung is on the 1st/2nd floor
4
Chinatown Point is a shopping complex near the Parkroyal on Pickering Hotel. While walking through this shopping area around lunch time, we noticed a queue of people waiting to dine at this restaurant and decided that was a good omen for our plans for dinner that evening. When we arrived for dinner we had a short wait during which time we were provided with a copy of the menu which enabled us to make our (numerous) choices before a table became available. When we were seated we ordered and were served drinks before the various courses came out. The food was fantastic! Rather than all our choices being brought to the table all at once, the courses were served progressively so that we had both time and space to enjoy. Would recommend
5
On our first night in Singapore my wife and I took a wander around the area we were staying in, and decided to "eat local", to get a flavour of local cuisine. We ended up in the Chinatown Point shopping mall and noticed a restaurant called Din Tai Fung which seemed very popular, so we gave it a try. Good job we did, because Din Tai Fung was amazing!The staff were very helpful and the food was gorgeous and very affordable. There's a good selection of vegetarian dishes; I went for century eggs, noodles and vegetable dumplings, all of which were tremendous. We're really glad we found this place - it was by far the best Chinese meal we had during our visit to Singapore
5
Din Tai Fung is famous for their xiaolongbao and i now know why. The inside was perfectly seasoned, soupy, hot and the skin was all so soft and so thin that you wont be afraid of getting full by eating it. The other dishes we ordered were good too, the shrimp fried rice, the noodle with sliced pork, everything was made with care and perfect to the taste. If you are planning to go for lunch, please come a bit earlier otherwise it gets very crowded - other people like this brand too. Have fun
3
Staff can't speak English and are not friendly, even though many non-Chinese speakers visit Din Tai Fung - this is a real problem. Otherwise excellent dumplings and noodles, same as all other Din Tai Fung outlets.
4
Very friendly staffs and very fast service. The xiao long bao is great. Try the original one. Other flavors can skip it. Will be back
4
I love the Earl Grey Lemon Tea and the noodle here. The beef and the wanton too. The spicy sour soup is good too. The only thing is the queue...
5
Their dumplings were to die for. A little pricey but the taste was very nice. Would love to comeback again. There is a complimentary tea with each meal. So no need to buy some drinks.
4
This place is usually crowd during peak hours and you have to wait for your table.
To me price is expensive but for tourists, it should be OK.
4
Din tai fung is a hot fav in sg. Always packed , every outlet is filled and there's always a queue. The service crew is highly efficient as well, everyone moves quick and ready to serve . Food never disappoints, delicious xiao long baos . My favorite is their chili , it goes with anything and everything ! There's this dessert in a small white bowl , black with milk , I forgot the name but it's soooo good. Love din tai fun

My daughter sugested we eat here and I can see why. The fried rice would have to be the best I have ever tasted, and the pork and prawn dumplings...well, lets just say there weren't any left. We also had some steamed bok choy with garlic and fried vegetable parcels. We received jasmine tea on being seated, which was regularly refilled. A must for anyone who loves steamed dumplings. I can understand why there was a queue forming as we left. Thankfully we had gone for an early meal

Monthly visit once, but different branches. Luckily Ding Tai Feng has many branches, I can enjoy great food conveniently. Chinatown branch, the seats not that grand as Somerset, Sentosa or MBS. I felt squeeze. But the food is still the TOP! As usual, ordered my favourite xiao long bao and fries rice with pork chop. And my friends order noodles (dan dan mian) their favourite

Was visiting a couple in Singapore and they suggested " great Chinese food". Went to the restaurant that is in Chinapoint Mall. The couple ordered for us... pork dumplings, chicken dumplings, fried rice and wraps with duck and green onion.... loved it! The best tasting Chinese food I've ever eaten! We had quick service. The food is served family style where everyone (in your group) can share, hot tea is readily served and if you don't want to eat with chopsticks.. then just ask for utensils. What's really cool, is watching the food servers make the dumpling and steam them right through a large picture window.I'm sorry I can't tell you food prices as I was treated by our friends.....I can only tell you how good the food was and that it is SO worth trying, if you are in Singapore

Recommended by hotel to go to Din Tai Fung whilst on holiday in Singapore. The recommendation was spot on. This really is an experience. Super efficient ordering system that you get used to quickly. Tick sheet left on table for orders. Food comes out quickly really hot! Food marked off tick sheet. The food itself was excellent both in presentation and taste. Jasmine tea is frequently poured into your cup, only a few have beer which is expensive. At the end of the meal you take the running tab to the counter and pay...simple

Being located in Chinatown, it will be best to avoid coming here at meal times to avoid the queues.
The service was fast and the seating was great i.e. no cramped.
Need to order: Xiao Long Bao.

Great food. Very efficient service. The best Chinese food chain. Great value for money. This location is not too crowded...

Freshly made dumplings and great flavourful soups. Especially the steamed dumplings and sumai which are soupy.
5
Our adventurous kids loved these dumplings and tired a new one each day. Easy family friendly place for dinner.

I've been to Din Tai Fung many times in the past, have always admired the efficiency with which they serve diners, their value prices, and the amazing quality of their food - which is why most Din tai Fung's will always be packed to the brim in Singapore. I came to the Chinatown DTF for a family reuinion - the experience was notable because of the long wait time (we waited over 25 minutes to get a table). The staff were kind enough to take our orders while we were waiting in queue. As soon as we were seated, the food started pouring in, and we weren't complaining - the steamed pork dumplings or Xiao Long Bao have always been a favourite of mine and this time was no different. Not to miss are the Fried rice with Shrimp and egg, the beef noodle soup, the noodle soup with pork chops, and the mango pudding and refreshing lemongrass juice
4
I can't even remember how many times I've already been here. The food is good, the sercice a bit less and their English is not what you'd expect. But still it's a place I go back to time and time again. Its dumplings are probably the best in Singapore and some other items on the menu are also excellent. You just have to bring visitors here every time, it's something everyone must have experienced. We're just so lucky to live here so we can go as many times as we like

I've eaten many times at DTF at paragon mall. Always rated that place 5 stars each time. But decided one day to eat at Chinatown branch to bring friends to try DTF and this was the halfway spot. Sadly the food was average and lacked the flavours I've enjoyed and wanted. Friends were not impressed and so DTF is off our visit list in future. But for myself I will visit the paragon mall branch and stick the place that meets my expectations. Just wish Chinatown branch had not let me down. Poor service and average food is my takeaway
5
Read about it and tried one in the Raffles City Center...was great... Tried the one in Chinatown mall...it too was great. Tried a number of different dishes...they were outstanding. Service was quite good...better than I would expect in a chain of relatively fast food restaurants. Don't miss the soup filled dumplings, the noodle dishes, ...we were happy with everything and the prices are quite good
4
really good place to try chinees dim sum. Each of which we ordered were really good. Quite busy place with nice staff- refill of green tea comes after each sip ;)
5
There is nothing to dislike. The dumplings are fantastic, the service is really efficient and prices are very reasonable.
5
Awesome steamed dumplings and plenty of variety. The food is extremely fresh and the service is 5 star. The endless Chinese tea is a bonus !
4
Worth the queueing. You have to take a number and wait for your table, but whilst you are waiting you get to review the giant photo menu outside and mark your order on the order pad you are given, so everything moves quite briskly when you are actually seated. The dim sum was great. We ordered a couple of other dishes too and they didn't disappoint either. The service is efficient but not overly friendly. The atmosphere is "busy"; a bit noisy and bustling, so not particularly relaxing or somewhere you would come to linger - the table are turned quite quickly so you eat and leave. Everything was very clean and you can watch the dumplings being made by people dressed in surgical scrubs and face masks through a plate glass window. All very entertaining

I work around the area and one day I went. Service was good and food is actually nice. Get the Noodle and special sauce. it does not have much in it, its just plain noodles and that oh so special sauce, its just sooo good and i dont know why. and of course, get the xia longbaos.
5
Those who want the Rolls Royce of dumplings - this is for you. Also you who never tried dumplings before - this is for you. Being a sucker for dumplings (after living in China) this branch is according to me the tastiest. Even if all DTF outlets are great, the taste at this one is just a tad better. Take a few selections from the menus and just enjoy! Going back tomorrow:)
4
One of the decent places in Chinatown. Ambiance is very nice. There may be huge waiting if you want to go for dinner. I usually went after 9PM and could get a place. I loved the egg fried rice, being a non meat eater.There are nice steamed veg dumplings to
5
This place has always been very reliable for good dim sum . There are the usual standard steamed ones and then some innovative local styles . I have not tried anything else here but its a good spot for lunch . Its busy , its not a glam place it gets packed and its good
4
Four of us went for dinner and went overboard with our selections. After you sit down, everyone is given a paper menu that one uses to make their choices (you circle the item and the quantity). You can definitely get carried away with too many items. We ended up with lots and lots of smaller dishes which we all shared and everything was very good. Service is excellent with waiters wearing hair nets and masks to cover their faces. It is a noisy place with most diners in their late teens and 20s. If you are staying in a hotel, be cognizant of how much you are ordering unless you have a refrigerator in your room and plan to eat it the next day

I'm a patron of many many dim sum restaurants (from many places in the US) and this place confounded me. My usual go-tos were either not what I'm used to or not available at all. Take, for instance, Har Gao. Not on the menu. What? lol. Their pork/shrimp siu mai was totally unlike what I'm used to. It resembled the dim sum soup sachets/dumplings instead. Needless to say, the food was delicious...but it wasn't outstanding enough for me to go back again. We enjoyed the food as they were and tried not to compare it to what we were used to. The shrimp w/ noodle soup was very good, the broth was excellent. The shrimp pancake was also surprisingly shrimpy and crispy (as opposed to being all batter). I hope to see this in US menus. I had the lemongrass juice. It was thirst-quenching and wonderful. The atmosphere was a bit rushed and tables were set close to each other (if you didn't have a booth). I didn't know it at the time, but they place a cloth basket right by your table to keep your purse and cover it with a napkin. I wish I knew that (bag was on my lap the whole time) and it would have been nice for the staff to tell me

I like the soup dumplings at din tai fung but the rest of the menu is fairly unexciting. This outlet in Chinatown Point has the advantage of not being so busy at lunchtime.
5
This lively restaurants serves very good chinese food at most reasonable prices, offers fine service and for the courious guest it has an large window to its kitchen where you can watch cooks prepare dim sum.
3
It used to be good, then the standards dropped, went up a while and recently, dropped again, Unstable food quality compared to the Paragon and Marina Bay branches.
5
all travellers must eat here good variety of choice, iced teas are just perfect, try the fried rices as well
4
Dumplings & Xiao Cai really tasted better than the ones from the original shop in Taipei! Will visit the place again. Anyway I have been patronizing this outlet for 5 times and glad they started this outlet finally in Chinatown so we dont have to travel to Orchard or Marina area when we miss eating the dumplings and xiao cai!

Din Tai Fung - a popular restaurant originated from Taiwan and franchised by Singapore's Breadtalk - needs no introduction at all. The long queue at nearly every outlet explains it all.The mom and I decided to drop by for lunch on this day. We started with a tray of Steamed Pork Dumplings - better known as Xiao Long Baos. This is one of their more popular dishes, and I do concur that it is not bad. The meat was tender and the bun broth that flowed out from the bun when bitten was delicious.Next, we had the Pork Ribs La Mian - cooked in superior broth with succulent, lean meat and bittergourd, a rather tasty homely dish. The noodles were springy in texture as well.Finally, the one thing I was here for - the Chilli Crab Meat Dumpling (Xiao Long Bao with chilli crab) - something seasonal, something I crave, and love from them. Succulent, juicy and simply scrumptious with a spicy goodness to it, mixed with the sharp sweetness of the crabmeat mixed amidst the minced pork - I could never get enough of this.For full review, please visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/11/lunch-at-din-tai-fung-chinatown-point.htm

This is a relatively casual Taiwanese restaurant, part of a Taipei-based chain. Focus is on Taiwan's equivalent of Dim Sum - various sorts of steamed dumplings, buns, soups, noodle, rice and vegetable dishes. As with a Cantonese dim sum restaurant you order by ticking on a menu slip and handing it to the waitress. They can be a bit slow to take your order but don't worry, once you've ordered the food comes with little delay.Overall this is a great opportunity to sample a good assortment of small Taiwanese dishes. Note that "spicy" here tends to mean only very mildly spicy

Had a meal here with family of our Singaporean daughter in lawGreat round table that fitted all 10 of usObviously the family ordered most of the food as they are locals, a great variety was ordered and shared, well presented, high quality mealI can not comment about the prices as the Singaporean family did not let us see the bill and paid out of sight from u
4
What else to say tht Dim Sum are great - you just wish you had ordered more !Prices are completely ok, service is good, and dim sumâ€¦ just excellent ! Only minus point is the location in the mall (not very glamorous) and cold AC but this is quiet normal for Singapore.We will definitively go back with a jumper 
4
I ate here 2 out of 5 nights I was in Singapore.The first night we had to wait about 1/2 hour for a table. There were 4 of us and we had a selection of wantons vegetarian, pork and prawn, duck rolls and pork buns, all were delicious. The service was good and our tea cups were constantly kept topped up. We went earlier the second time and got a table straight away. This time we tried the pork chop with the fried rice along with some wantons. This was a good choice too. I would recommend eating here. You can see the staff making the wantons, so you know they are fresh
4
Tried the xiao long bao and also one set with red bean filling. Loved the red bean set, and the presentation for the drink is interesting with a ball of ice. Well done
5
Dumplings are awesome! Xiao Long Bao, Shao Mai, etc. Price is on the expensive side but sometimes you really have to pay for good food. Ambiance is great too! Be sure to come in early specially for large groups or prepare to wait in line.
3
Good value for money, sprxially for people who try dumplings for the first time, but really not the best i've tried (far from that)... They lack of taste!
Maybe too delicate flavour for my vulgar taste...
5
Went with the family based on a recommendation from the hotel we were staying in. The food was superb and all three children demolished the food. Noodles, dumplings, wontons, rice and duck rolls were all excellent. The food was so good and due to the children really tucking in we had to order a few more dishes. Great service and very quick service. We are going back tomorrow.
5
Like all Din Tai Fung franchise restaurants, the food is great, service prompt and food incredibly fresh. Travelling to this restaurant you will need to get off Chinatown MRT station and a short walk to Chinatown Point shopping centre.The restaurant doesn't take bookings so it is recommended to get there early and enjoy
4
This is a Taiwanese style restaurant. We ate dinner here on a Friday night. Even though it was a busy night, the waiters were extremely helpful with explanations and service. The chili crab and pork bun was excellent. All steamed dumplings were good. The food that other tables ordered also looked very appetizing. Cannot wait to get back there to try more dishes. The prices were very reasonable. Dinner for two came out S$35
5
Our concierge at Marina Mandarin Hotel recommended this great restaurant inside of the Chinatown Point upon learning that we were looking for a good nice Chinese restaurant. What a great find! This tapas style restaurant offers varieties of dim sums and other Chinese goodies in a very pleasant and clean atmosphere with gracious and attentive services. Every dishes we had not only looked great but all delicious (and all at modest prices) We will definitely come back to this great restaurant the next time we were to visit Singapore
4
Even though this place does not have the best dumplins or soups, it is a nice place for eating and a good choice, moreover when you can find it in several locations across Singapore. We tried 3 types of dumplins and one soup, all of them really good
4
This was the second Din Tai Fung location we visited. We arrived early, before the restaurant got too busy. The food was delicious with the steamed dumplings and wontons in broth the highlights of our meal. Dining here is a unique experience, popular with locals and recommended for visitors to Singapore. The hair-nets and surgical-masks worn by all staff involved in food preparation certainly reassure that food hygiene is a top priority. The service , however, was a little brusque for our liking. I am sure that the staff need to turn over tables quickly and efficiently, but a little more care would have improved our experience

The Xiao long Pao was great, I would say the quality is the same as the ones in Taipei.The place in Chinatown point is big, but I would think that it gets full during lunch or dinner time. We went there around 11am so there was not many customers yet. By the time we were finished, the place was starting to become full.One tip for foreigners who might not understand Chinese, the tea is not free. You will be charged S$1 per cup. So if you do not want tea or not everyone in your group wants one, tell the waiter when he/she brings the teapot over that you do not want tea or would only want so many. Water is free though
