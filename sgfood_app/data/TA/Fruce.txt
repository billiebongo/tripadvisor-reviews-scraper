Had the coconut fruce and the coconut cafe mocha. They were both really good. Best tasting healthy coconut based drink selection. Want to try the others in their menu

My friend actually introduced me to this drink stall n upon seeing the queue, I knew I was in to some greatness here. Ordered the avocado n coconut drink w/ sago n after an anxious wait, I was not disappointed. The drink was smooth n delicious w/ avo n coconut. Not too sweet n yummy till the last sip

I was walking by and was offered a sample of 1 of their drinks to try: mango with sago. I was sold!I went back to try another drink: I tried the pandan coconut, less sweet. Simply delicious! They use fresh pandan juice and gula melaka. I watched the staff as he prepared my drink: much like a scientific experiment. Every ingredient was carefully measured. Much care was taken to prepare it.They use only natural ingredients. Order your drink in medium or large size, choose a topping (if you want) and pay. Then wait for your order as it is carefully prepared fresh for you.Oh, and while I waited for my drink, the staff offered me another sample: coconut advocado. Yummy too!Enjoy! You will love it
