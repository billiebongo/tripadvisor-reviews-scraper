Dine here to have a good view of the performance, of the night safari
Food was okay no complaints, fast food with souvenier bottles
2
The dinner here is very expensive & food offered was below par i mean the food items Offered. It is highly expenisive but it holds a Monopoly at Night safari to have an Indian meal.. If given another choice would choose that
4
It's a restaurant within the Night Safari. Maybe there are no many restaurant selections inside but if you like Indian food, this is a very good choice for you.
4
After our excursion to Singapore Night Safari, we had our dinner at Ulu Ulu restaurant. It is rightly located just before exit. They have set meal options for Indian food which was good in taste & quantity. Overall a good experience having dinner there.
3
We had dinner here recently as part of our Singapore Zoo night safari. The buffet selection was quite reasonable and the chicken tikka was the pick of these selections. It was delicious. The remainder of the food is okay without being outstanding.
5
We took our dinner here, just after our night safari tour. I can say that the food quality and taste is really very good. They have a lot of options for different nations. We really enjoyed our dinner here. If you are going for night safari, you should also visit this restaurant
4
Had the Ulu Ulu buffet before our Night Safari. Food quality and variety was excellent, Japanese, Indian, Chinese, Malay, etc. Food replenished regularly and staff very polite and helpful.I thought cost was a little high, but that was because we had some beer which always puts the price up in Singapore. The tables and chairs are not the most comfortable, it feels a little "staff canteen" like but if you want a good selection of food well prepared then try thi

I visited this restaurant as a part of the Night safari at singapore tour.the indian food served was the best I had in my singapore trip.The Complete spread was lavish especially the Gulab Jamuns...too tasty.I highly recommend this hotel to all Indian food lover
4
We took Indian buffet included with Night Safari tickets and this is the restaurant where they serve the food. The food was good (compared to what you get in Singapore :P) to fill an hungry stomach. The buffet included everything from salad to desert. We were served 2 vegetarian and 2 non-vegetarian curry, Nan (this is the only option you get in whole Singapore), papad, good variety in fruits and salad, 2 types of rice (both were taste wise same), 1 type of dal and vanilla ice cream with strawberry or chocolate syrup. Would recommend to included Indian buffet dinner for Indians with Night Safari tickets
3
Seemed like a good idea to go early to the Night Safari and eat dinner there but this restaurant was a let down. The ambience was good - open air tables that worked nicely on a cool dry night. We had the bulgogi which was decent but the ayam panggang was a disappointment. Dry chicken thigh with tasteless soggy yellow rice. Service was indifferent and disinterested.
4
Visited on 16/11/16,after work with friend. Tried it's Chicken Bulgogi set,$22.90. Chicken barbecue till tasty. My friend said mine barbecue version taste better than hers'. Tried the Almond n longan dessert $6.90. My friend's Grass Jelly with sea coconut is sweet.
3
Had dinner here prior to the night safari, the food (Indian and Korean) was well presented and tasty. The cost was on the expensive side but not by too much (apart from the beer which was extortionate).
4
The food is pricey by Singapore standards. Quality is good. Best is the helpfulness of the staff. They made us special noodles for our kids and delivered them to the tables.
2
Obviously everything is exorbitantly priced. The least you expect is above average food in terms of taste and presentation. In addition, it seems that the staff at the restaurant were over worked or sleepy as the customer service experience was almost robotic.
4
This was an option on the trip that we did. It was worth it as the food was a buffet type but had an amazing amount of variety and my family enjoyed what they ate.
4
The best part about this place is that it serves authentic Indian Food and especially Veg Dishes, though non-veg dishes are also served in the menu. A must visit restaurant in the Safari.
4
Good food but It can be pricier than the rest of Singapore so dont be surprised!! Since its a tourist area.. Try the Chicken rice, Naan, or Briyani! Good stop for dinner time with the family and place to rest... Be prepared for huge crowds cause it is 1 of the 2 restaurants they got
3
Expensive, but convenient for tourists looking to save time. We got an Indian vegetarian set menu. We asked for tikkas but they said it would take time. $2 gulab jamun was a great surprise for our kid ! The buffet menu was $32 and the set dish was $17, both pretty much had the same to offer.
3
Came here for dinner before entering the night safari with my kids. Local food is relatively tasty and the Indian food was spicy but authentic. Extremely expensive though, costing about $20 for a meal of fish curry briyani which u can get at a third of the price in town.
5
Dinner at this restaurant was included in our tour ticket. We were told at the outset it would be crowded, so we prepared ourselves for a frenzy. Not so. Ample tables well set apart, wait staff on hand to assist and take drink orders. The buffet was sumptuous and included well cooked and presented dishes from several Asian countries - Sweet & Sour Fish, Chicken with Chilli and Cashews, Satay sticks, Pappadums and Naan Bread, Linguine, Rice, Miso Soup and fresh cold meats and fish with a salad and dessert bar including fresh fruit. The price of $45 was reasonable and the time allowed to enjoy it was fair. Clean rest rooms and restaurant. Would thoroughly recommend it
3
The a la carte section was reasonable and good food. The buffet inside was too much for our family with little kids.
4
Conveniently located and timed with the night feeding of animals, the humans are also very well taken care of.
4
Situated a little interior of the zoo, but its a buffet served is really nice and the restaurant style and design awesome, very unique, just be there experience the thrill of eating.
1
Tasteless food. Dont step your foot inside and save money. All the dishes have the same gravy and the attitude of waiters was very bad.
4
The buffet here before the Zoo tour was great. It was part of the overall Night Safari tour package through Viator.
Food and the selection offered was very good.
3
We booked the Asian buffet dinner. It was fair priced and the food was generally delicious, better than I expected actually. However, they have arranged us to a non-air-conditioned dining area when there were seats inside. Yet, the one thing that really let us down was the dessert. There were flies surrounding them and ants crawling on the plate with cream puff. Disgusting
5
After tiring night safari, Dinner at Ullu Ullu restaurant was refreshing.Good buffet with lots of variety. Tey had Indian food, Veg / Non Veg and Chinsese food as well. We thoroughly enjoyed. Sweets were Gulab jamun and Ice cream.Non veg preparation was quite good
3
We had the buffet, which was acceptable, but really nothing special for 34/45S$. The dishes are customized for bus tourists. (Chinese, Japanese and Indian standard dishes that you can find everywhere). Also drinks and cocktails are overpriced and the dessert buffet was not very inspiring. We mainly decided to take the ulu ulu because of the possibility to book a table, but the food court area in front of the night safari was not particularly crowded, so you may want to grab a burger instead.
3
Ate here before doing the night safari. Meals are in 2 sittings I was on the first. Extensive buffet with various Asian cuisines. Plenty to choose from. Desserts were excellent, a range of bit size pastries and cakes as well as some rather brightly colored ice crea
3
In a foodie city like Singapore you really have to stand out to get and above average rating. What stands out here is the location. The nigh safari is fantastic. The food is good - not the best in town by any means - but better than most zoo restaurants. So go for the setting, and enjoy the food
4
Had some korean BBQ before the Night Safari, food was good and reasonable priced for the Zoo. You have a few choices at the Zoo entry but I would recommend this one.
5
Great choice of food from the buffet for both adult and kids. A good desert menu also. Just mind the step in the male toilets!
4
The ambiance was good and the service was upto the mark.
Restaurant is at the entrance of the Night Safari and recommended for its vegetarian and non-vegetarian varieties.
overall it was a good experience
5
We liked the ambiance and the service. Restaurant is at the entrance of the Night Safari and recommended as a must stop to unwind before you proceed to city for late night parties...
5
They had a well laid buffet covering both Indian and International cuisine. The Indian section had a good variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food and the Chefs were continuously replenishing the food. Overall a good experience.
3
Average tasting food... nothing great! But then this is not a full fledged restaurant either so okay.
3
Food is good and the ambiance is better than other safaris where food outlets are not that good. After safari it's a good place to relax.
4
veg was also available..fish was good...one can can good food here...good Indian food is available...ambiance was okay okay..

I came here with my tour group for dinner, probably because it is a buffet restaurant meaning that there is always something to cater for everybody (unless you are Muslim because they don't serve Halal food). Despite the name, the food is all Chinese (with a name like Ulu Ulu I thought it would have a more African flavour) though unfortunately they didn't have any chopsticks (I prefer eating Chinese food with chop-sticks). There is also a bar, and the drinks are pretty reasonably priced. Oh, I should mention that it is actually a part of the Night Safari, though it isn't the only restaurant there â€“ it was just the one that they selected, probably because of the buffet
1
Went here with a booking nd no one to attend , place was empty even on a busy Sunday as only some groups who on a package tour come in for a buffet nd finish in 15 mins , staff is so arrogant , only 3- 4 dishes in a buffet , no soup , juice or starters , just the main course, there are many good eateries out of ulu ulu who serve ghost food , never make a mistake of booking this place as it's not worth for free also .... That's y is say BAD Is a understatement....
3
The prices are high because you're stuck a long way from town as you wait for the night safari. That said the food at the Korean grill was very good and service prompt.
4
After day's drain out at zoo and safari, this was one place that ended our day on good note with tasty indian buffet to replenish our lost calories.
1
In the 30 days we spent in Asia this was the worst meal we had. It was a buffet with a small choice of foods, all dried out and over cooked. Very disappointing.
5
Yep after the tour we sat here and had some basic nice hot and fresh food. Not to bad for value. After all you always pay a bit more at venues like this
4
We got the complementary dinner arranged at this restaurant during Night Safari. The service was prompt and food was good. Besides little india, one of the rarest place at the site seeings to get Indian vegetarian buffet
3
We were booked here to eat around 6pm, and never arrived on time. When we arrived 40 minutes late, the guy said it was not a problem and asked if we wanted to have a look at the food available before we sat down.Im glad we did as most of the food had run out, it looked dry and for the price paid the choice just did not seem worth it.I have a feeling that many people may have complained and this is why he let us look at what was available before we committed. I was dissappointed as from the pictures I thought it was going to be a lovely experience before our safari.I told the attendant that I had changed my mind and he was fine about it. I walked about 10 steps away to an indian place that was alacart and was sensational.I rarely make a bad review, but felt that the Ulu Ulu would most definately note lived up to what I expected had we eaten there.
2
if you can still resist your hunger maybe you should find another place to eat than here, it maybe have varieties of food but i wouldn't recommend, someone ordered sprite from one of us but they gave something else that doesn't taste like sprite uggh it taste awful:( since its a themed resto inside the night Safari it's a busy place, lots of people are ordering food, the price is high for a small portion...expensive
3
This is one of the rare restaurants to serve Indian food other than in Little India.The food is decent although portions are little. Steeply priced but considering its a themed restaurant inside the Night Safari its to be expected. You can opt for the buffet though
3
Too expensive for the quality- S$17 for chicken rice?! crazy. Also, ordered the teh tarik ($4.80) and none of the two people at the drinks stall knew how to make it. After two tries I ended up with a milky watered down drink. Disappointed. Quality needs to increase and prices should be more reasonable (it is cheaper at the zoo!)
4
We patronised this restaurant for lunch and tea-break during our visit to the River Safari. I like it that the restaurant was not crowded (likely because we were there as soon as it opened), has full-service and great ambience as well as serving wholesome authentic Chinese food. Also, the price of the dishes reflected on the menu is inclusive of government tax, so what we see is what we pay.There is a buffet lunch at $22 nett per pax which starts at 12.30pm but as we were there before 12pm, we ordered ala-carte instead. For those who must have meat, the 'trio meat' selection (S$22.80) is a good choice. It included cuts of Char Siew (ie BBQ pork), Roasted Duck and Steamed Chicken. We also had the Braised Claypot Beancurd with Prawns and Crabmeat (S$17.80) as well as two vegetable dishes with 2 bowls of chicken rice and a bowl of porridge. Adding the drinks, wet hand wipes, condiments, the total bill came up to about S$79 for the three of us which I feel is very reasonable given the good portion, fresh quality, attentive service and inviting setting. After roaming around River Safari, we stopped by the Teahouse again for a mid-day drink and snack. From 2.30pm to 5pm, the restaurant offers five different local dishes (such as fried mee siam, laksa, hor fun) with a drink at S$9.80. Add S$2 to get a bowl of wanton soup. I had the vegetarian fried udon noodle which, although a bit too oily, was nevertheless delicious. The Fruit Platter at S$7 is a good way to wrap up the day. My son had the Coconut Jelly which I find exorbitantly expensive at S$9.50.This restaurant is located just at the entrance of River Safari so one need not have to enter the attraction in order to have a meal there unlike Mama Panda Kitchen which is within the premises of River Safari itself. I walked past Mama Panda Kitchen whilst exploring the park. It was small in size, and even with indoor and outdoor seating, it was difficult to find a seat due to the crowd. Plus it is fast-food style. So in comparison, I do prefer the River Safari Teahouse for much needed tranquility and sanity.Eating at any outlet at a tourist attraction is never easy on the pocket, but overall I feel that the River Safari Tea House ticks all the right boxes, even its pricing vis-a-vis other outlets there
1
Meal was cold look liked we were the third group through. 2 Tiger beers 355ml cans $23:50 at the bar in the Zoo. Would not recommend the meal with the Safari.
4
a good place to take a rest and must order
Panda bun which is limited supplise
Kids love it with red bean inside
the Bamboo rice alway sold out
3
As in all commercial touristic sites- reasonable food, reasonable variety, reasonable prices. Nothing more nothing less..
4
We had Laksa, Indian curries, Satay and all were very tasty. The setting is also nice, as the restaurant is open and our table was facing the plants and trees of Night Safari.
Will for sure come back.
1
...eat elsewhere first.
Food wasn't that great at the price you get fleeced. Trust me, I'm Asian.....I know how chicken rice should taste like at 1/4 of the price, even in Singapore.
2
Personally think that, the food is not nice at all but the price is quite expensive, so it is not worthy to me.
4
We did enjoy the food, there was enough selection, and all good quality. Really, the price is relative to the scenario, It's convenient when at the night safari. We had the Asian buffet (the early one) which had a small selection of Indian also. It was clean and stand out was lovely ice cream. Just don't fill yourself up too much, as there is potentially a bit of walking to do at the night safari! :-
3
The food was not bad but the prices will hurt. A LOT. You shouldn't be paying this much for local food that tastes comparable to food courts and hawker centres elsewhere, and only a quarter of the prices they charge.We ate there as we simply had no choice - we were starving from a whole day at the zoo, and still had the Night Safari to tackle. Our advice to others is to eat before arriving at the Night Safari, or if you're doing a full-day visit of the Zoo + Safari, bring your own food if you don't want to be ripped off.Plus, they were playing songs like Sealed with a Kiss, and Bengawan Solo. It made it just that little bit harder to digest the food
5
So many selections of food... I really enjoyed the satay and the ice cream for dessert. There is a self serve water station and if you are like me and dread the heat/humidity Singapore offers you will appreaciate knowing you do not get served by a waiter and can get your drinks yourself.Buffet style if you have not figured that out.Interesting wood tables help provide an atmosphere. Do not spend a long time here. Eat lots, but quick, and move on to see the Night Safari on the tram. If you are here on part of a tour like use (Tour East), make sure you do not waste your evening here by taking a long dinner
3
the area looks nice. it takes the theme well. displays make it feel like we are in a market of Africa. food itself is good. tasty and it looks nice. depends on you. it is expensive it you usually dine in the food court. but if you usually dine in top restaurants in new York, this will be average. the seats is not enough. visitor limitation or restaurant expansion will be a good choice because the area was very crowded when i visit. the portion of food is large for me. very good. the quality is great. i ate the pasta with shrimp. the shrimp was large, juicy, and tasty. i don't think i will ever see shrimp so large for the rest of my life
5
Make sure to try the satay here! The rice cake and the satay are both delicious. Not to be missed if one is visiting the Night Safari!
3
We had Indian food and some drinks but the food was just average. The offering and the taste was not so good. The stuff used for vegetable dishes was Tofu instead of cottage cheese, which made it bad.
3
Paying 20$ for just a plate of vegetarian rice (biryani) - very expensive.
The quantity also does not suffice as well.
3
The dinner at Ulu Ulu was included as part of a tour to the Night Safari Zoo. The meal was quite good with an extensive variety of food. It was set out smorgasbord style so were able to go back a few times for more. The setting was outdoors and very pleasant. It was the best part of the tour as I didn't enjoy the wait in the sweltering heat at the tram for the safari tour, but that's another story
4
This restaurant has a rustic setting of what houses and shops use to be in the earlier times of Singapore, thus it's nameL "Ulu" which means rural in Malay (one of the 4 main languages in Singapore). Having said that, it's situated in the Night Safari which is a very popular attraction; be ready to pay skyscraping prices for the meals. A glass of sugar cane juice that can cause anywhere between $1.50-$2 cost about $8 (SGD). Nevertheless, it's still a good place for the tourists to dine to experience the local cuisines if they are pressed for time to go to neighbourhoods that sell the authentic hawker foods. MUST TRY: Black Pepper Crab, Fish Tikka set, Laksa & the Dumpling Noodles
4
The food was all tasty, nothing stood out. Really convenient due to being at the zoo. The interesting thing for a US based traveler is that you could get a duck dish that was good at a zoo. Look for a seat with a breeze as it is outdoor seating. The arrangement of food on the duck platter was good with a good assortment of food balancing tastes
4
For a restaurant experience in a theme park (the Night Safari), this place is great. Selection is very good, food is fresh, prices are reasonable. Compared to what's available at your typical zoo or amusement park or the like, Ulu Ulu is fantastic. We always make a point of arriving a little early and eating right before we head into the Night Safari. I wish they had better fresh fruit juices, but other than that I have no complaints
2
We made it a point to have dinner at Ulu Ulu Indian restaurant based on recommendation. We realized that the quality and taste of the food was bad, some of the gravy items were burnt and smelling bad. When complained the lady on the counter did not bother to review. Except the naan / roti, no other item (veg or non veg) tasted reasonable. This is one of the worst Indian food we had in Singapore. What is also important is the attitude of the people who are servicing. A customer friendly approach could some times take care of the issues. As also stated in other reviews, there is a very limited choice of 1 veg item and 2 chicken items. Never mind driving to the city and have food somewhere else unless Ulu Ulu at Night safari brings out lot of improvement. There is lot of opportunity for improvement, we wish to see a better Ulu Ulu in next visi
3
Taste is average and price is expensive.But if you plan to visit Night Safari after Mandai zoo or River Safari, this is a place to fill the time between closing time of daytime park and opening time of nighttime park.For whom can't wait their dinner until 9:00p.m., after visiting night safari
3
The food was expensive ,each dish averaged around 20 SGD excluding drinks and these are local food fare example chicken rice,noodles,briyani.The taste was just passable as well as the quality was very average .Try eating well before coming to avoid this and just have snacks if you get really hungry along the way
