Best crab meal in Singapore - most under-rated restaurant . the preparation of the meal was less then 15minutes,, freshly made and the prices much better than other well published venues. both the chilli crab and pepper crab are a must have ....

we were invited to this restaurant for dinner, our Singaporean friend ordered crab and other local seafood, it is so fresh and nice prepared.

Easy to find with parking convenient. Good service. Food is fresh . Only problem is seating arrangements and harsh lightings makes it a less pleasant atmosphere . Will go back again. Highly recommended.

Ordered Chili Crab, Crab fried rice and hotplate tofu. All three meals were delicious, highly recommended!

I went with friends and ordered the Chili Crab and Crab Beehoon. Both were absolutely delicious. I’ve never had either dish so don’t have a comparison - BUT I love seafood, especially crab, and these crabs were fresh and made well. The crab meat didn’t stick to the shell, which is a hallmark of well-cooked crab! We had a reservation for 6pm and were the only people there. By 7pm, the place was filled and there were people waiting. It’s extremely popular and everyone seemed to be local.

This place is air conditional and located near LINK Hotel .Nearest MRT :Tiong Bahru (EWL) and Outram Park MRT (NEL / EWL). walking distance from tiong bahru about 15mins. You will see alot of post ww2 resident area on the way . Speed of deliver food :Very poor especially waited 30mins for 1st dish . That 1st dish is rice and 3mins later is vegetable and so on . Waited 1 hr for the crab . I overheard another table (big family ) keep asked them when food is coming . Pigeon 乳鸽 :Not those roasted . Taste not bad Abit disappoint because we are expected is roasted. Black pepper Crab:The sauce didnt go into crab meat hence it seems like rush to prepare .Usually restaurant will prepare a bowl of lemon so that you can wash hand / remove the crab aroma on the hand. It is not provided so either you visited the washroom or you use own wet wipe. Rice :Small bowl of rice charge $1 . really worth it ???Snack:Once you seat down and they will offer snack (example peanuts etc) please kindly denied it . Usually chinese restaurant will charge it to your bill even wet towel . Ambiance : Dont expect decorated dining area . If you feel that the table is shaky ask them assign another table for you . The floor abit uneven so you may need adjust your seating position . Washroom :It is not located inside the restaurant . Nearest washroom located at LINK HOTEL. Smoking zone:Smoking is not allow in air conditional area which prohibited by law. Overall : I definitely not patron again especially there are even best restaurant in singapore. And reviews are overated . The staff sort out the vegetable infront the view of diners. They should get movable wall / partition or do it behind the wall . The place is not small and such preparation should do it behind the scene

This is the place to go for Crab and Seafood, located on the ground floor of the Link Hotel. We had Chili Crab and Crab Fried Rice, which we shared with each other, the Wife and I. Both dish were perfect, the chili crab is so delicious. Conveniently located, Great service, and very clean, and pleasant dinning atmosphere. We will go back again

We dined here tonight. Ordered 2 small crabs (black pepper & chilli), 6 fried buns & some greens. Both crab dishes were well prepared & packed with flavor. The black pepper was my favorite, I found the chilli crab a little on the sweet side (but not overly so). We ate everything! I have zero complaints about the food. Crab is priced at $6.50 per 100g (which can add up to a lot). Ours came to $136 for the 2 crabs (before service charge and gst). Not a cheap meal but cheaper than other crab specialist restaurants in Singapore (i.e. Jumbo). Personally I think the food here is as good (if not better) than Jumbo. Don't expect too much from the restaurant though, it is very basic - plastic tables & chairs, paper napkins & wet towels (that are charged at 0.50 cents regardless of whether they are used). Service was efficient & staff were friendly (as friendly as someone who doesn't speak English can be). I would certainly recommend this place. I think I'd like to come back & try the curry crab next. If you were only going to try one thing on the menu, my pick would be the pepper crab.

Local restaurant in Thiong Bahru area. Specialised in all kinds of see food. Very friendly service, you can order S-M-L portions and the waiter clearly indicates that the small one is probably more than enough. Try besides the seafood als the coffee ribs. Very good !

We wanted to eat crabs and didn't want to go too far. We searched and found this restaurant. We ordered some chili and curry crabs weighing a total of 2 kilos , fresh poached shrimps along with other dishes. Curry crabs are hardly served in other crab specialty restaurants and they were so tasty, so delicious. Everything we ordered was satisfyingly wonderful and we enjoyed eating here where we didn't see too many tourists.

Enjoyed the food but one of those places where we did not feel "as valued" as the locals who received better service.
Excellent whole crab in pepper sauce. No complaints with the food.
5
This is a old school restaurant with very nice Chinese cuisine. The best deal is the crab with many types of cooking available. Crab lovers this is the only restaurant you must try.
5
Authentic and delicious. We loved it so much (curry and chili crabs) that we went back again. The staff is very friendly. The is the place where the locals go! Really great food in a casual atmosphere.
4
Their crabs are so good in whichever way they cook! Even the cold crab is great!!
My other favorite here is their cold cockles - a dish not to be missed.
Definitely a good place to go for friends gathering or business entertainment!

Not bad food on the same token did have better in Singapore worth a visit if your in the Outram rd area
5
Hands down the best meal I had in Singapore!! It is full of delicious authentic Singaporean food, with lots of options including for vegetarians. Open till late and close to hotels!! Loved it.

Honestly, truly, genuinely, the best crabs we've ever tasted! This is where we come to treat ourselves, spend the whole evening gouging. The cold crab and the curry crab are musts, but all the other varieties we've had are just as fine. The curry crab is not the thick, artery-clogging variety, but more fragrant and light, so your arteries get only half clogged, while the rest of your blood can still flow through to your brain to give you that feeling of sheer, ecstatic euphoria! Being a small (read cosy and intimate) restaurant, reservations are recommended, but we normally go before the dinner rush and stay till after everyone has gone. Service is wonderful, prices not so but well worth it as a treat. After all these years we still cannot find a worthy competitor

It's been ages since I visited No. 3 Crab Delicacy Seafood Restaurant so I was thrilled to be able to return for a fix last evening. As we were planning to visit another restaurant after this, we only ordered 2 dishes - both of which are my favourite ones here. We started the meal with a large plate of Drunken Cockles (S$20 / US$14.67). The juicy raw cockles had been cured in soy sauce, Chinese wine, garlic and topped with some fresh chili padi (Thai chili). The copious amount of minced garlic imparted a lovely flavour to the dish but doesn't make for a good dish to indulge in if you're on a first date. Another signature dish here is the Curry Crab in Claypot. Even though it's been a long time since I ate here, the rich, creamy curry gravy was as good as I remembered. The flavourful gravy was a perfect complement to the smooth strands of boiled Beehoon (rice vermicelli). The medium-sized Sri Lankan Crab was succulent and so big, it was almost spilling out of the claypot! The Crab dish set us back by S$ 75.40 (US$ 55.28) before 7% GST & 10% service charge. The beehoon is priced at $5 (US$ 3.67) per plate, which though pricey is worth a splurge to be able to fully appreciate the flavourful curry gravy. If you stop by here and have a decent tolerance for spice, do order the Drunken Cockles and Sri Lankan Crab Curry

We ordered all three crabs, the curry crab, the black pepper crab, and the chilli crab, and more than 30 of the buns; and just stuffed ourselves silly, as it was all so delicious ! And cheap ! Ridiculously affordable and exceptional quality. Next time I'm in Singapore this will be my first stop !

My husband and I just went there for dinner after reading the TA reviews.It was a bit disappointing. The baby squibb was actually caramelized, not bud if you like sweet fish, but really to hard.The soft shell crab was good even if the crab was almost non existent. The ladies finger a bit too soupy.Maybe we didn't choose the right dishes.
5
looks like nothing from the outside, just a kitchen with some tables: do not get fooled, the food is over the top amazing, delicious
4
Food - especially the chili crab - was really good.
It is a shame the restaurant lets you pay for things you did not ask for. Maybe this is common in Singapore, I do not know. Anyhow, go here for good chili crab.
5
Their crab curry did not disappoint. Not fine dining but the food was amazing. And it's value for money.
4
We really loves the food here - shared the eggplant, green sambal & crispy squid. $6 for a can of beer though! Way over the odds.
5
Crab here is fresh and delicious. They have many ways of cooking it and it's quite different from the usual styles you get in the market. Price is reasonable. Located at outram road in the city center, nearest mrt station is outram park.

After reading some of the negative reviews of 3 Crabs we were able to visit it again after a two year absence. It is still great. We had a huge black pepper crab, some beautifully presented drunken cockles, and the surprisingly good stir fried sweet potato leaves. The crab was so big that we ended u skipping dinner. Service and decor wre exactly what you'd what in a hole-in-the wall "discovery" -- friendly in a non-English speaking, "we're really busy" sort of way, and with no decor to speak of -- sure signs of a great Chinese restaurant, right? Anyway, looking back on the reviews, the one thing the bad ones seem to have in common is that their authors were all cashing in some UOB bank voucher, proving yet again that there is no such thing as a free lunch. We counted our meal as our Singapore "splurge" -- the 1.5 kgs crab came to $$78 -- and enjoyed every finger-licking slurp of black pepper, green onion, and nobly sacrificed crustaceans just as much as we had two years previously

The decor is clean, neat but pretty basic, but who cares when they produce food like they do!I visited this restaurant with my wife and a friend. We ordered the deep fried soft shell crab, the curried crab, razor blade clams along with bean sprouts and bok choi.The soft shell crab was crunchy and quite rich but the accompanying mayonnaise really made it taste great.The curried crab came straight out of the kitchen and was bubbling away. The sauce was spicy (But not unbearably so) but full of flavour. The crab itself was full, sweet and fleshy. Magnifique!The service was very quick and friendly and they were quick to provide advice if requested.Definitely, if you come to Singapore and you want to try some genuine Singaporean seafood at a great price, then come to this place

Although not modern the 3 crab restaurant serves delicious crab menu's.The chilli crab is especially tasteful and the crab fried rice a delight. They tend to give you peanuts etc and charge you for them even though you did not order them. I go here a lot due to the tasty food

So happy we took the advice of our taxi driver and had the chili crab at 3 Crab Delicacy Seafood. We enjoyed it. It is an expensive dish for frugal foodies beware. The overall appearance of the restaurant is old school. It could use a face left but the food was tasty. Now, the bathroom/ restroom is the same one the employees use. They need to solve that. I felt weird walking through the hall close to the kitchen. I wasn't a staff member so it felt weird to be in the back and not in the actually restaurant's bathroom for customers. Also it was close to our Wangz Hotel. We just simply walked back to our room#605.

Very close to the Holiday Inn atrium .Great Chilli Crab.one was enough for two people not a cheap meal but you get what you pay for.just a plain looking eatery but dont judge a book by its cover.make sure you order the steamed buns with you meal very good to soak up the beautiful sauce
5
I and my friends were there because reviews in tourism map to taste a popular meal in Singapore. Chilli crab in this restaurant is not only good but superb!! You should try when you come to Singapore. We're really enjoy of this dish. Highly recommend!!!

Simple and nice local place with very good menu and delicious curry crab.
The staff were also very attentive which is quite strange for a Chinese restaurant in Singapore.
Give it a try even if it is not in the center of the city!

Crabs were just ok, but overpriced. Customer wasn't informed of the increased in price for crabs despite checking with the staff before ordering. Staff directed us to the menu pricing which was $5.80/100g, but was charged $65/kg. Told service staff this when bill arrive, but no service recovery was done. Terrible! Wld not come back again
4
Hole in the wall looking place. We went for the chili and pepper crabs. Be aware that $5 or $6 per 100grams can add up quickly. We asked for 1 small chili crab and 1 small pepper crab, and we still walked out $100 lighter. Well worth it as long as your expectation is set correctly. You pay for good crabs. Nice cheap buns to mop up sauce. We pigged out and ate 2 crabs and 12 buns. Also note that you will get messy with sauce!Easy walk from Outram Park subway station

We were staying at the Wangz Hotel and saw this restaurant just a few metres away in Outram Road. We had planned to go to Jumbo Seafood for crab but decided to give this a try.The restaurant is casual and quite small.The chilli crab was just as good as the ones I have had at Jumbos but considerably cheaper.The baby squid dish is very unusual and well worth a try; it's almost like eating squid pop corn. The chicken wrapped in cabbage was also unusual and a nice offset to the spicy crab.Service was quick and helpful
5
You wil not find fresher or higher quality crab anywhere in Singapore. This Chinese curry is creamy and perfectly spiced, excellent with the gorgeous little fried buns that are served with it to soak up the sauce. This place is also known for its Cantonese cabbage chicken, braised for hours, tender and with a delicate and delicious sauce. We also had what would seem to be a very basic dish of scallops with broccoli. The simplicity, the sweetness and perfection of the cooking was extraordinary . Don't come here for the ambience, it's a tiny neighbourhood joint with stellar food and nice people

My wife and I were hunting for a great chili crab to help us recov e from an awful meal at at an Australian fusion restaurant the night before. In 3 Crab Seafood we found it. A true hole in the wall, with just seven tables to watch the rain pour down as we joryously cracked shells and dipped fried mantou into the richest, most savoury, most delicious chili crab in all of Singapore. In all honesty, we warmed up with a black pepper crab that was good but not great (for those of us who like it really black peppery). But that tured out to be the right order since it made us appreciate the excellent chili crab all the more. What made it so good? Well, compared to all of te "famous" chili crabs in Singapore like Jumbo or Long Beach, 3 Crab's crab isn't at all sweet. Garlic, yes. Lots. Chili, that too. So if you prefer crab popsicles, don't come here. But if you like your crabs large, spicy and hot, then there are six more tables waiting to be filled. We can't wait to go back for their other speciallty, crabs cooked in a clay pot ith vermicilli. Sanggat enak

Just expect to have a typical normal type of crabs.. we ordered Chili crab and curry crab, since there were 6 of us.Chili crab was quite good, a bit spicier than other restaurants that i had before. Curry crab (chinese style) was fantastic, did not expect that it will turn out quite niece. But the highlight was the Crab quality. The meat was so thick and fresh.. and it did not stick to the skin when you peel it off...The other dishes are so-so.. pricewise I feel it is on the high side, but if you are looking for great crab, I do recommend this place
2
True, we were not in the market for crab, but the noodle dish for $16 was underwhelming at best and then we found that they added charges for a small dish of beans they placed on the table AND the packaged wet wipes which we hadn't touched, in addition to service and tax. Maybe this is typical for Singapore? It did not sit well with us visitors

My family and I stopped at this resturant on a whim during our last day of holiday in Singapore. The menu looked good and there were a couple of free tables.The hostess seated us and talked us through the menu - explaining differences in the various crab dishes that were offered. We ordered a range of dishes including chili crab and pigeon. The staff were friendly and the food came quickly and all at the same time. The taste was very good - espeically the chili crab, which was outstanding.I would recommend this place to other visitors to Singapore
