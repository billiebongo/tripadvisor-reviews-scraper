went to the one at united square; cosy place but tend to be crowded during lunch. We ordered the rib-eye steak set. The price is reasonable;

Nice ambience for all sorts of dates and gatherings. Food was good, menu was extensive. However, it would be great if baked potato can be in the menu (instead of mashed potato). At the moment, there is additional $2 surcharge for bajed potato.

Loved it for years, it is one of my most favourite go to restaurants. been coming for ages and it never disappoints.

Haven’t been to jacks place in years. Mostly because we can get cheaper and better steaks at most places these days.
However, nostalgia is priceless!

Very quiet when I was here mid afternoon so you will get more attentive staff than usual. They have good tea time sets from 230pm-530pm.

I have a lot of expectations on this restaurant. The ambience when entering this place is good. Perfect for lunch or dinner meeting. The steak is the main star for me for this place, although it is Good, however I find something is missing on the taste. Maybe the sauce or the side dishes.

Have not been to Jack's Place for a long while so we thought it would be amusing to pay a visit. Memory said the steak was good but was rather disappointed as it did not live up to the expectation. Maybe it was just nostalgia. Was surprised when the bill came. It's rather pricey these days. Staff were friendly though.

Went with my family and I had the rib eye. Not bad... good value for the price you pay. Would come back.

I had the fried rice and though nice, you can get an equally delicious plate from a Hawkers centre at one third the cost. Maybe next time I will stick to the steak!

Good food and service provided by Jack's Place. Would definitely come back again for birthday celebration.

Serving of our food was fast and waitress recommended a fish skin snack was very tasty.
the only comment is that the air-conditioning wasn't quite cooling.
5
They accommodated to all our needs. We had an infant with us and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly

My colleagues and I truly enjoy our lunch that day, with your always delightful lobster bisque soup. I ordered the mushroom spaghetti with chicken executive lunch and it tastes marvellous too!

Any of the Jack's Place Steak House's in Singapore are well worth a visit they have not only NZ meat (steaks) but also Barramundi from Australia. I had the Ribeye steak and my wife had the Barramundi and as usual they were excellent. We topped off our meal with coffee and ice cream A must tr

I arrived 10 minutes before my reservation and table is already set. It was Fathers Day and low light ambience gave a sense of relaxation and comfort for the diners stressed out for the day. The meals were served in reasonable time although the restaurant was full and guests were waiting in queue. Service staffs were courteous and able to maintain good good service quality. Well done, Jack's Place.

I had dinner at Jack's place in JEM (in Jurong East) recently and had a wonderful experience. The food was great, as was the service - it was a company dinner, and the wait staff were tremendously patient taking food orders from such a large group of people. It was because of that great experience in JEM that my I asked my friend to go to the branch in Ang Mo Kio - thinking that since it's a chain of restaurants, the standards should be the same across the board. While the service in the Ang Mo Kio branch was good enough, the food wasn't impressive. My meal was barely warm and tasted average. I would have to be in a generous mood to return to give it another shot.

Worst Mothers Day lunch here. Aircon not working and we were not informed in advance. Everyone is perspiring like mad, with many using the menu as manual fans. Management should at least put up fans to ventilate the place rather than let their poor customers suffering. So much for the customers services. They really need to learn from others leading customers services outlets.

We had tried the steak in other restaurants but we could not find any better than Jack's Place. We like the ambient there especially with friends and family. We would go for Jack's Place whenever we want to eat steak.

Food was good and the lady asst manager was very passion serving me and my friend with a very good smile. Keep it up! Cheers :)

Apparently this is the casual family restaurant under the same group. We have to order our food via a touch screen menu before we were directed to our seats. Food was delicious and reasonable portion. Value for money.
5
I came for lunch. The service was excellent, I love fire steak. value for money. If I come to singapore, I always visit this restaurant for sure. never find better steak than here. the topping also great.

We had a nice dinner in Jack's place. The American beef steak was tasted good. Set soup was not so good. No need to go for set menu. Service attitude was really nice. We spent around 35 per person.

Been here before. So after exercise at bishan park. Stopped here for dinner with family.The restaurant has offered new dishes, but we sticked to the usual dishes- jacks place steak. Uncles fish n chip. Escargos. Etc. Escargos is wonderful. Oyster a bit dry. Steak is wonderful. Fish n chips nice.Restaurant is crowded on weekend. Better make a reservation

Had company celebration n was able to get seated even though we did not make reservations in advance. Set lunches were great combinations, have good variety. Orders taken quickly. Food served orderly. Portions were enough. Ended with earl grey cake n coffee. Won't go wrong with this franchise, anyway. If you want a good steak, try Jack's.

I had lunch with three of my colleagues at the Jackâ€™s Place, located at Block 730 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, Singapore. Although the restaurant is located in a neighborhood of the heartland, it has a neat and cozy ambient. I ordered a Black Pepper Eye Fillet medium rare with soup, dessert and coffee and it turned out to be value for money. The staff service and the food standard are good and we had a pretty good meal

Came at 11:10am & premise was a table with 2 customers. Saw mgr Jack Phang at the reception counter & instead of him greeting me, his customer, "Good morning", I had to greet him out of courtesy. There was no smiles on his face but a reluctant looking cold long face. I humoured, "How come no smiles from you as a manager?" He changed topic instantly & no apologies whatsoever. There was no warmth nor welcoming hospitality from Jack at all, I was utterly shocked coming from a Jack's Place senior-positioned staff, not from a new junior intake. I was ushered to my table & he didnt even recommend me anything from the menu which as with JP's culture of doing so in my last 25 years wt JP. He left me wt the menu & I had to wait for 10 long minutes for him to attend to my ordering despite an empty premise. This was rediculous. I had to shout out for attention, & i saw Mary walked in & immediately came to my table while Jack was pretending to be busy at the counter. Mary was an angel & she deserved every praise & promotion should there be any position given. She wore a pleasant & genuine smile as she approached me & very courteous & professional in waiting, 50 times much better than Jack Phang, her manager. I gave my feedback to Mary regarding Jack's foul attitude & unwelcoming behaviour despite an empty premise. Mary did recall reading my positive & highly encouraging reviews of AMK JP during Mr Toon's time. So i asked Mary where are some good staff whom i used to bring my family to dine frequently from 2002 to 2011 such as Benjamin, Shah (Gurmit's cousin), Margaret, Catherine & even the very nice Michael Zhang. The corn soup & garlic toast were served & before i could finished sipping half of my soup Jack served the sizzling ribeye steak. That was bad timing & never occured ever in my 25 years unless it's a totally fresh new recruit. When i bit into the cauliflower, i sensed they were uncooked & very hard, not even a 3 minute boil. I called for Mary to try it & she brought it back into the kitchen to feedback the chef. I could hear shoutings of a male voice in the kitchen & i suspected it must hv been the male chef was unhappy with my feedback & must hv scolded Mary. Bear in mind, I was eating my steak halfway & was waiting for the verdict of the cauliflower. It took Mary to return 10 minutes later & by then, my supposedly sizzling steak had turned cold. Perhaps, Chef Tan should try biting into a cold steak & see whether that's a professionsl way of serving & satisfying customers. Mary returned with a pathetic portion of well-cooked cauli. I told her that the chef & kitchen staff must hv a lousy rotten attitude as a chef for being incompetent & holding a rebellious attitude, they oughy to be sacked bcos the lasy customer behind me also had her cauli uncooked wt her chicken chop dish. She had to request for her uncooked chicken to be taken back. Her case was a confirmed evidence to me that the chef was not performing his duty properly. Mgmt better looked into this before many more customers got uncooked food & food poisoning. After finishing my steak, no one bothered to serve the next dish & i had to wait for 10 minutes just to see a waiter in sight. Apparently, the whole venue was with no staff. The lady customer behind me felt the same sentiments too & mentioned out, "How come there's no staff to call?" So, i saw Dong Li from far near the kitchen & i had to raise my voice to catch her attention. She walked over bit with a long sour black face, no smiles whatsoever & not a welcoming gesture & facial expression. For a moment, I thought i was not welcome to eat in JP anymore. This lunch was for my birthday & i had to face with a nasty cold manager, Jack Phang & a sour long black face Dong Li!! Is this how JP bosses & mgmt want to see customers being treated in this way on a birthday celebration? Fortunately, Mary Dong was there & she had all the right & professional attitude, aptitude & attributes of a good staff. Mary displayed courtesy, efficiency, attentivesness & genuine care for customers which both me & the lasy customer behind me vouched & praised Mary alot. I was surprised when Mary brought the birthday cake wt a candle & played the birthday song. Thank you so much Mary for everything nice & professionally done. I even managed to convince the lady customer behind me to sign up for JP membership but Jack was not too excited nor appreciative when i related to him & to get the app form for that lady. I was really puzzled why JP mgr doesnt know how to appreciate good gestures, not even a word of thank you. Perhaps, he's not cut to be in this service industry but managing supernarket suits him better
