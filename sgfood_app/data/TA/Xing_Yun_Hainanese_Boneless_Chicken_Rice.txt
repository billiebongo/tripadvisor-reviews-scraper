Another hidden gem to discover in Singapore. In the West of the city, juicy and tender chicken at its best. The locals seem to love this place, people queued when we were here. I will return when I am in Singapore again.

In the hawker centre 5 min away from Chinese garden mrt.
Very soft Chicken. Japanese like to visit this shop. Not easy time change highly recommended.

The first thing I did upon alighting the plane was to message my colleague to get some recommendations for some hawker style Hainanese chicken that I could take away to consume later in the office prior to an afternoon meeting. He recommended Xing Yun. Took a while for me to locate in the hawker centre, although I should have guessed it from the length of the queue. I got there after 1 p.m., so unfortunately they were sold out of wing and gizzard, so I had thigh and liver instead. Very yummy and better than anything I've had in Hong Kong
