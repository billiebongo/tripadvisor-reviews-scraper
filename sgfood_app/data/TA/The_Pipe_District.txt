Great place serving great food at reasonable prices. Hidden gem up the science park road. Perfect for people living around Pasir Panjang road, where food choices are rather limited. 5 starts for this place.

It was a quiet spot to have great food and drinks on a Friday night. We had the pizza, wings, 2 servings of aged beef which was heavenly and 3 sides. My favourite side was the mash with truffle oil. We whacked the duck pizza. The crust was thin and crispy - absolutely perfect to dip into the mash. My friends had the beef which was great. I was a fan of the wings - salted egg. Finger licking good. We enjoyed the craft brews too. Loved the ambience and fabulous food!

We were the only table during lunch on the PH which is not a bad thing away from the city buzz and crowd. The pool table, Soccer table and dart machines kept us entertained while waiting for the food. Needless to say, food was decently priced with quality. I love their charcoal dory, it was fresh and cooked well. Was not a fan of the salmon, maybe salmon isn't meant to be battered. Their ossobuco and steak were not bad either. And they have Guinness on draft, a totally plus factor to unwind at pipe district.

Place was very quiet except for another table seated outside when we visited on a weeknight. Surprised that being in the middle of all those office buildings, and serving great food and beer, it was almost empty. We had salted egg chicken wings (lovely!) and a tiramisu topped with chocolate lava (sinful) to share, 2 mains and 2 coffees. Very reasonable prices for food of that standard. I do wish the sweet potato fries that came with the charcoal fish and chips were crispier, and the flat white coffee wasn't a normal brew with a teaspoon of milk added. This place is worth a visit especially with the Entertainer app, and if you are looking for some peace and quiet. It is difficult to get to without a car though as there's only 1 bus serving that road.

The place can be inaccessible without a car. Its a great place for supper as its quiet and you could play darts with no long queue and loud music. The salted egg butter chicken wing is a must try and the staff told us that its an improved recipe. It was my first time trying this and so I am not sure how the taste has improved compared to the previous recipe. The cafe does hold private events especially for birthday celebration if you are looking for a place

Going for Lunch at Business time in Science Park Singapore? A tricky one. If you do not prefer the canteens for locals, you can find a nice business lunch set here. For 18 dollars three courses is acceptable and reasonable. The food was perfect, nothing to complain. Even the menu card offers a wide range of dishes. Looks fresh and tasted good. The ambiance is modern (industrial). Can be recommended
