I was surprised at this place. It looks pretty dodgy, but I was taken here by a friend and loved their Biryani. I'll be coming back and next time trying a kebab.

An Indian expat colleague brought me to ‘Food on Fire’ to experience Northern Indian cuisine. It’s certainly a value Set Meal, which is sumptuous & delicious. I had an enjoyable lunch experience, reasonably priced + staff is attentive & absolutely flexible in catering to our food appetite (sharing), as we’re unable to finish two Aloo Paratha, and ordered/paid for just one (1) instead of the standard set of two (2) servingsKeep up the good service

I never had imagined one could eat poorly in Singapore. To start with, let us acknowledge that this is a street food restaurant, but still we're in Singapore that displays some of the best street food in the world and from hawker stalls to simpler street food places everywhere differing, I've never been disappointed, at its worst it was average.A colleague suggested this place and I still regret yielding and not going to so many other places in the vicinity.Usually it's always a safe bet to go with the meal of the day, in my case jeera (cumin) chicken. It comes with a bit of basmati rice, that even this tasted of nothing!, small naan, poppadoms and a bit of, decent, dhal. As for the chicken, it barely had any meat on it, it was cartilage buried in a red cumin sauce, just because you disguise it, we can still taste it!...To end this unusual lunch... the waiter dropped the tray on our colleague's trousers (served him well for suggesting the restaurant in the first place...) and did not offer to pay for the dry cleaning (ok let us be realistic I wouldn't have expected something like this, it's not a michelin star restaurant)....Just to end on a positive note though, the prices are good... if you do not cross them with the quality that is (how much would you pay for poultry cartilage?...)Just avoid it

This is place is always packed and so good. Mix of tourist and business people. Best Chicken Tikka I had in Singapore. Copious portion and very reasonable prices! Been there many times and never had a bad experience. Please note it is outside sitting only. You Pay at the cash register at the center of the of the restaurant. Be careful they do not take many credit card types. I think Visa only or cash - better to check before otherwise there are cash machines in the his area (financial district of Singapore :-)). Enjoy

First, let me be clear if you order a full tray of food for 10-12SGD you should not expect fine dining. However, it's not fast food either. we typically wait 30-40 minutes, which is fine for food freshly made to order, in my eyes. The service has always been great. My favorite is keema mutter which is minced chicken with peas. But I have never had a duff meal there yet. After a few drinks along that stretch, this is conveneient and perfect way to finish off the night - do try it

This is a great location for Indian food. I had lunch with some customers and all lived it.The service is quite friendly and professional. They don't accept credit cards but let us go and get some cash to pay.The dishes are provided quite quickly and especially the "Chicken Tikka Masala" I had tasted just delicious, the prices are totally OK.I can totally recommend this restaurant where you can sit outside and enjoy your meal while watching people walking by through the pedestrian area

Boy, what a horrible lunch. Big mistake to have stumbled into this place they call a restaurant. Crappy food followed by crappy service. The restaurant served malai kofta where kofta was like a solid rock and tasted like one too. Completely unapologetic about bad service and worse food. Keep away from this dump. Your 10$ are better spent in the Subway across from this store

What a fantastic set meals they have made with drinks. . $10 u can feed ur self like a hungry king. .The kebab thai was also great paired with raita daal making salad and garlic naan. .The best indian food in the raffles area. .

Cheap cheerful no fuss Indian in the CBD area. Not many people around on the weekends but weeknights it's packed. Butter chicken was awesome, garlic naan and some spicy potato thing was also tasty. Recommended highly :)

If you want an okay-ish Indian lunch with efficient service, then you are at the right place. This place offers set lunch for 10 dollars and the choice is quite good. Their Punjabi Thali on Wednesday is consistently good but the same cannot be said about others. They also serve veg and non veg shawarma kebabs. Veggies need to be careful as the waiters often mix up veg and non veg wraps and even when asked to check, the response doesn't evoke any confidence.In summary, okay sort of a place to check out once in a while.

We were staying nearby (at the AMOY hotel in the Telok Ayer CBD area) and happened upon this place as we love Indian food. It isn't much to look at but the food we found to be very good and excellent value - so good in fact that we ate there 3 times!One the (apparently all Indian) staff got to know us they really made us feel welcome - we had some good banter.We also noticed that most of the customers appeared to be Indian as well - surely that says something?You get a big meal - complete with rice, a naan, poppadum & dhal - for only $9-11 with a pint of Heineken to wash it down for $9 in happy hour (1 for 1

Been there multiple times and loved the food almost every time. They have awesome lunch sets which are very reasonable as well. The right match of quality and quantity. Would definitely recommend for lunch and snack fare. For dinner, I would not recommend as I have found the food losses it's freshness when it was prepared during the lunch time. Nevertheless, a do try.

This is my fav Indian Thali (set meal) place. Alongwith the thali, they also have different types of wraps and kebabs on the menu. Its conveniently located. The only disadvantage is that they do not have an AC section. It gets very hot on many days and very sweaty by the time to you finish your lunch. Good place to have a tea+samosa snack in the evening

I discovered this place down the end of all the bars and restaurants along a pedestrian area. A nice surprise given the other more western bar type places along there. Great food, all very simple but very tasty. I tried a few things which were all excellent. It's cheap as well. 20$ for enough food for 2 and drinks.

I've been already several times and the food has always been excellent both the vegetarian (half the menu) and the non-vegetarian options. Definitely my favorite Indian so far.Service can be really good to ok depending who is serving you. Prices are very decent. Food is comes fast.If veggie: try the veg meal, very cheap (6-7$), very good and way too much. Friends can recommend the butter chicken, lamb and much more.Don't be scared away by the waiters calling you in or the cheap looking tablecloths on the corner.I always entered via Pekin Street. The next door Kebab and Beer factory are from the same owners (I guess) which makes it very convenient if you're having a drink there or your friends don't want to eat Indian food ;) you can sit anywhere you want, just ask. Also very good for big groups. Last time we were with 14 people, service was excellent and quick

What a great place! If you like Indian food then this a real treat. The customer service is really good unlike other places in Singapore. If you are a vegetarian then this is a great option. They use less oil and cook everything from scratch. The food is served outside on the street. This did not really bother me too much. They have fans blowing and this keeps things cool. Try the Chilly Chicken (starter)

We ate here as the restaurant we had headed to was shut. Lucky for us as the food was delicious! We ate a set menu with curry, naan and poppadoms as well as some tasty drinks. Everything was fresh and hot and really delicious! Unfortunately it was our last night otherwise we would have come back again
