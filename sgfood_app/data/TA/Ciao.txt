Fantastic night at Ciao@! The food was amazing and the staff sang happy birthday to me! Will definitely be back. Highly recommend if you're after a nice Italian meal in Singapore.

Was there for lunch, had the burrata cheese, Parma ham, melon and salad, a tomato soup and a pasta dish. Enjoyed the appetiser n soup but found the pasta dish on the salty side. Overall ! enjoyable lunch

Went for pizza and was greeted with really friendly crew and the pizza was quite decent and reasonably priced
5
You can find fancier but probably not better tasting Italian traditional home cooking. Excellentüëçüèª

Manager Domenico made us all feel welcome and took his time to ensure each member of the family got exactly what would make us happy. We enjoyed a great authentic Italian meal at a reasonable price.

Best vegetarian calzone in Singapore, great pizzas, entres delicious, great atmosphere, the people who run the place are friendly Italians, the desserts are to die for, good beer and a good selection of Italian wines.

It was such an enlightening experience to dine at Ciao Sg. I count my blessings to have found Ciao when walking along Haji Lane searching for espressos. Owner/Chef Domenico was very friendly & kind. I came back the same day for lunch & tried their special family recipe, tuna cooked with handmade pasta paired with white wine as recommended by the Chef. It tasted so good! Such comfort food to have, after days of travelling. A few days later, I came back again for dinner. This time, I tried their Margherita pizza, which tasted yum. Overall, food is good, fairly priced, with personalized service & great ambience. I would definitely come back for more. Ciao.

An Italian friend living in Singapore took me to Ciao@ for dinner. Chef and owner Domenico is a superb host. We let him choose the dishes (and wine) and it was all perfectly cooked and delicious. Probably better than Mamma makes! Certainly the best Italian meal I have ever had.A really enjoyable experience was topped of with a great limoncello.I definitely will go again. Ciao
5
We made our way to Ciao for a Italian lunch with wine. The owner, Domenico, was alone but gave us undivided attention. He recommended wine, dishes for vegetarians, even put bursts on top of our pasta as an extra touch. Everything we had was delicious! I highly recommend this bright spot on Haji Lan

My husband and I (both Vegan's) went over with some friends to Ciao. We had an absolutely amazing time. Not only did Marima,go out of her way to make sure that our dietary needs were met but the food was delicious. Service was great. We're already been back and will keep going back
5
Great place to go for good Italian..Warm Service and Nice Ambiance. Love the Special Squid Ink Octopus pasta and very nice dessert. Live Jazz Music on a Friday night was nice & relaxing.

After our dinner we had a drink in this pub-restaurant in the famous Haji lane. There was a fantastic atmosphere. The service needs improvement it took 5 min before we were presented the dinks menu,‚Ä¶

Great restaurant great food great service and great atmosphere. I have been to Ciao about 5 times and it never disappoints. The service is great and the staff will chat and engage with you.

Two of us wanted a quick break after shopping in Haji Lane. This was open mid afternoon and we ordered a cafe latte and Campari. The Campari was listed at $8 in the menu, I asked if I could have it with Soda. The loud mouthed Italian said that as this was Singapore, they don‚Äôt serve Campari Soda. This was baffling to me, since Campari was already listed on the menu, it suggests that Soda isn‚Äôt available in Singapore. After explaining the obvious, this arrived - however the price had now jumped to $15.The caffe latte arrived in a glass, it was almost white in colour, which means there wasn‚Äôt much coffee in it..it also arrived hot which was great, but with a plastic straw which wasn‚Äôt so great. Mr. Mouth told us that this is how it‚Äôs served in Italy, which isn‚Äôt true and I know as my family are from Rome. However there was no point pursuing a conversation with a combative service provider

We wandered down Haji lane after a day of exploring the city, and stumbled on this awesome authentic Italian restaurant. A lot of love has gone into this place. The Italian owner / chef came over to our table to welcome us and to let us know that he had fresh octopus in from Sicily, and had just finished some homemade gnocchi and pesto. We ordered one of each (Octopus carpaccio) together with a pizza and a couple of beers. Amazingly delicious, top notch Italian food. This place is on my list to always visit when I‚Äôm in Singapore

Helmed by jolly Italian Chef Domenico, Ciao is one of our regular dining joints. Nestled along bustling Haji Lane, it serves up authentic Italian cuisine that pleases and is yet friendly to the wallet‚Äî the La Pugliese comes with a good-size portion of burratina cheese loaded with Parma ham and a thick slice of rock melon, excellent value at $19. We love a simple Margherita Pizza, and here it is cheesy and comforting with a thick chewy crust. Pastas are done al dente‚Äî the Vongole Spaghetti comes in a herbal buttery sauce; but what impresses is the Maltagliati Bolognesi, a handmade flat pasta generously coated with a rich and tasty tomato meat sauce‚Äîespecially delicious when paired with the bottle of Sartori Montegradella Valpolicella Classico Superiore boasting fruity plum notes

I come by pretty often to this restaurant, and I dont get why its not more crowded than it is. Its a Italian family-run establishment - the pizzas are awesome - just the right thickness, and crisp, the pastas are tasty. Its just good homestyle cooking. If you're stuck for options, and if Chef Domenico happens to be around (he seems to be always in), just ask for a recommendation - some days he comes up with something off menu and special, and it always tastes great. Been to many of the eateries down Haji lane as its close to workplace, and this is among my fav
5
This is one of the best Italian cuisines we have ever been too. The best quality, fresh, clean, and delicious pizza and starters. Staff are more than friendly too, a wonderful experience.Advice you if u have the option to try it you will enjoy it 100%.
5
Ciao ticks all the boxes!!! Food wise, the wines, Italian beers, great atmosphere and located in the dynamic area of Hajilane. In addition, the prices are very reasonable. It‚Äôs just the place to go to as a family, as a couple or a dinner/drinks with friends. We have been here multiple times and we were never disappointed.

Visited last Saturday as group of 4. I'm pretty sure our service experience was a once-off since it's not consistent with rest of the reviews. We arrived looking for table for 4, and were "greeted" by waiter who shrugged and suggested we look to see if a table was free ourselves. We sat down once we found one and seemed to annoy the waiter when we asked to order 15 minutes later.We did notice the great menu and wine list and friendly italian chef who was entertaining another table. However, we were stuck with our excuse of a waiter (wearing a backwards baseball hat and looked to be asleep standing up!)He had to come back to the table 3 times to repeat our wine order and actually opened the wrong bottle. He hit off the next table and broke a plate and glass on the way! At this stage it was laughable but we enjoyed our dinner when it came. Very good pasta and pizza.Again, we had to annoy him for dessert menu and we received coffee half spilled over the table.Overall, great food but bizarrely poor staff experience. No idea how someone like that was hired in first place

Second visit to this restaurant and the service is still what stands out the most. Genuine Italian hospitality - reminds me of my time in Italy. Great wine selection.
5
Excellent food. Friendly and helpful staff. Interesting boss. It has a very unique environment. Very condusive for catchups and family meals. Fantastic experience!
4
Staff were very pleasant and it was a good place to have an authentic Italian experience. I could even customise my pasta dish!
4
Good and affordable. There is a bar and restaurant area. Nice place for a chill out with friends or to have a good dinner
4
we had an awesome early dinner at CIAO in Haji Lane. Great food, friendly service. They have a great menu with a little bit of everything, be adventurous and enjoy. We will be back.
5
My family always feel welcome when we are at CIAO. I have been to CIAO umpteen times and food has always been consistent.I've brought all my friends to try the restaurant and they've always enjoyed their meal there .The stand out dishes are the tartufina pizza , polpo and calamari.There is a good selection of reasonable wines to suit most palates and the casual ambience always makes you feel at home - this is a perfect place for you to have a gathering with a group of friends or family, without breaking the ban
5
We were walking at midnight looking for a place to eat around the area and we decided to go into this place cause it ha the football on.And what a treat it was!! The pizza was delicious and the tiramisu was divine. The drink were at good prices and cocktails seemed good.The staff was very welcoming and you can see a passion about what they do!I would definitely come back! Strongly recommend this place!! Enjoy
5
Having been there multiple times, the way to have a great meal is talk to owner Domenico and tell him what you'll like to experience and let him settle the dishes.The seasonal specialities from Italy are what makes it wonderful. Domenico is a great character and ever ready to attend to your needs. Domenico, his daughter and Giovanni are all friendly and helpful. Great selection of Italian wines, beers, homely Italian service and great Italian food makes Ciao a place worth visiting often
5
For real italian taste and amazing wine list at reasonable price considering the taxation of wine here in Singapore, here I find really best bottle.Pizza con il salame piccante was real amazing and beside nice staff , and again thank you Domenico as this is one of the few occasion where I can find good Italian food and wine so far from Italy.grazi

We came here to have some drinks while waiting for the rain to stop. The wait staff who ushered us in didn‚Äôt seem to care that we were there. He wasn‚Äôt one bit friendly. They should consider hiring people who know how to be nicer to their customers. Didn't enjoy the Prosecco I had. It tasted bad; very low quality
5
When there with my friends for a Friday night chill- out session. Pretty impressed with the lively vibe.Staff are friendly, nice and cheerful! Thumbs up for the food and ambience too !
5
Probably the best pizza I have had in Singapore in a long while, and the Italian bottled beer was ice-cold and tasty. Highly recommend this spot, we will be back
5
Never too often we spend time to recognise quality of service and food. Ciao deserves it for the quality of italian ingredients, the mamma's recipes and the wine selection. Bravo!
4
Impressed the bar is linked to restaurant all de way inside shophouse. Spacious! Staff (Indian lady) is excellent. She speaks well, knowledgeable, polite & helpful, flexible in our orders.
Nice idea to write on wall who have been in Ciao!
5
Love the ciao pasta! Truffles fries was good, however I don't really the idea of using the sack to hold the fries. Pork knuckles was a little hard to chew.
5
If u are looking for authentic Italian in Singapore, this place is must visit.
It has a very nice ambiance. Food is perfectly awesome. Has options for vegoterians too. That's the best part.
Try pizza witch.
5
Good time with good Italian foods! We will came back soon, thanks for the good time and for the super delicious tiramisu!!! The best cake ever!
4
Good food,Great host and chilled out environment. Free flows of Italian style tapas during happy hours.
Friendly owner and good pizza and seafood.
5
Toasted bread with mozzarella and olive oil to start things off. An exquisitely prepared gnocchi with coarse home made sausage and saffron sauce and peas for the mains. The gnocchi was like little pillows melting in the mouth. Gosh! And then the panna cotta. Oddio!!! Floored and speechlessThe owner and staff were very attentive. The owner came by a couple of times to chat about the food. When I complemented the food he thanked his mamma for having taught him well. He even offered to teach me how to make the perfect gnocchi. I think I will take up the offer this summer.

too chewy fatty pork collar, special of the day served room temperature.generous ingredients for parm ham pizza and stuffed cod fish. thin crust pizza was hardened. best taste for tomato base cod fish, appetising. tiramisu on the wet side. plain water chargeable at 50 cents from 2nd refill onwardsrelaxing atmosphere, friendly staff who explain the dishes details to us
5
Went for lunch with my family.

Tried the seafood pizza, margarita and cold cuts.
Keep up the good work!
We will be back :-)

Lousy service.. Aircon does not work well and they blame it on the outside air being too hot. Refuse to serve cold service water.
5
Authentic italain cuisine.
Great value for money and good deal promotion especially for drinks!
Tried Griscia and pork knuckle, I'll definitely come back and have it again;)
Thanks chef Domenico

I'd been to Ciao for drinks and snacks in its Haji Lane bar and decided to try out it's restaurant (which opens out onto Arab Street) for Sunday lunch. My partner and I are well travelled and have enjoyed (or not) meals in excellent and reputed restaurants around the world. It was fun to enjoy the relaxed setting and atmosphere which has all the characteristics of classic Casa back in Italy. The menu was varies and interesting but our visit was enhanced when the chef talked to us about what we liked, what was fresh and what he recommended based on our tastes. We left him to serve us up a selection of tasty, perfectly cooked and well balanced dishes. When I say he served us up a selection, I should say that he created a menu just for us and it was clear that he put his heart and soul into each dish. The restaurant's recommendations re wines to accompany our dishes also did them proud.We were not rushed and able to take our time over food and wine and all in all, a wonderful place and way to spend a Sunday afternoon.We will definitely return in the near future.P.S. There's a great selection of Italian beers I hadn't seen or tried before, but liked so much I brought a few bottles home
5
Superb value for wines, great Service, relaxing atmosphere. We've been in Singapore the past 4 months and we wish to have discovered this cozy place since the beginning !! Homely and fantastic original Italian food !! Thank you Ciao@ for this beautiful experience every and each time !
5
Haji Lane was a great shopping destination - very different to the showy malls with some lovely boutique type shops. Loads of choice for food but we fancied pizza so Ciao it was. Great authentic Italian pizza and excellent service and a white wall to graffiti on made it a great destination for lunch.
5
We came here with some Italian friends and according to their opinion I have to agree that this food was real authentic Italian food!All ingredients are imported from Italy.If you are looking for very good wine come here because the prices are absolutely fair!A must try - Tiramis
3
Last night was my second visit to this place. The previous visited was drinks only with a few friends last month. This time we went in after dinner and a few glass of cocktails from the bar nearby. The beer served cold and a glass of pinot noir was quite good. The let down was a soggy truffles fries... The services was always attentive here for both visited.
5
If you like proper Italian food - here you go. From homemade pasta to pizza and everything that comes with it! Have a limoncello and desert after dinner, won't regret it :) All the ingredients are imported so you can be sure the quality is outstanding
4
Only had drinks and tiramisu this time ----but they are great.
Will definitely come back to try their food soon!
5
Met some friends there one night and was nicely surprised. Good music, friendly service, reasonable priced drinks and AMAZING pizza. The best pizza I have ever had. I want to go back to Singapore just for their pizza.
5
went their because my friend told me about the place.glad he did.simply super tasty authentic italian food.the best pizza i had for long time.its a secret jewel.
5
Staff were friendly. Have knowledge of the food to make recommendations. Ordered the ham platters and aspect came out wonderful. Pizzawich is a must try if you want something different! Love the food and the friendly staff.

I was there for my business dinner during a short stay in Singapore.... This is a big surprise from this kind of restaurant! I can expect from a food court but not from a "restaurant" cockroach in my pizza! So disgusting......
5
Visited this restaurant today with the fiance's family for Mother's Day dinner and was pleasantly surprised at how amazing the food was! Every dish reminded me of home cooked comfort Italian food. The truffle pizza came out of the oven hot and bursting with flavors, we could smell the nice truffle aroma from a distance away. Best I've tried. The pork knuckle (chefs mums recipe) was extremely delicious too. It was fall of the bone tender, the meat was moist enough and the beer sauce complemented it very well. So much nicer than German pork knuckle! The pan-fried calamari drizzled with sauce (starter) was also special and the texture was just right. It was so good we ordered a 2nd round. The chef and boss were very friendly chaps, they spent time to chit chat with us and made us feel really at home. I will definitely be back here again. The only negative point is that the restaurant can be a bit hot
5
I visit this restaurant on regular basis and I am delighted every time I dine at this place. Chef can come up with amazing surprises. Order a Ciao Pizza and tell the Chef that he can surprise you and he does.Pasta selection is also very impressive, cooked perfectly the food is light and not heavy and loaded with cream or cheese as it may happen in many local Italian restaurant.Great Place! Highly recommend!! Do not forget to try the TiramisuCiao! Ciao
4
we were there for my hubby's birthday dinner. service is fantastic - attentive service staff, food is good, ambience is nice. what more can we ask for?we had bruschette (toasted bread with tomoato etc), calamari, carbonara, half n half pizza, pork knuckle, fries in a gunny sack. food is tasty but maybe we ordered way too much and were not able to finish, they even packed the bal for us. we also had cocktails and beer.the desserts are to die for - tiramisu, pannacotta.overall a very enjoyable evening
5
Chef Giovanni said that we are not in Italian Restaurant, but we are in Italian Home, thats what making Ciao@ so different, as its simply homey Italian cooking which is made by heart by chef Andre and Chef Giovanni. The food really tasty, simple, and its just Right.. The restaurant setting is homey with open concept kitchen, so we can see Chef Andre cooking, and its connected to the bar but its looks separated, its like 2 in 1 setting. You can choose to have your food in the bar or in the restaurant (more family oriented and for bigger group). They have big wine selection from Italy, and they have promotion where you get 50% off on the 3rd bottle and you can leave your bottle there for next visit.We start with Scarmoza topped with Parma ham, its cheese rolled into bread with parma ham and rocket leaf on top. Next will be the calamari, but here its not fried, but sauteed, its perfectly done as its not chewy, its soft and so tasty. The maincourse we do prosciutto and tartufina pizza, half2. For us its a perfect combination. And the best is.... TIRAMISU... its so creamy and soft, perfectly mix in layer, I ate 2 portion myself :-). Highly recommended for family or friends gathering or a simple dinner out for couple who are looking for good home made italian food with cozy setting. Will definitely come back when I am back in singapore.

3 visits have convinced me that Ciao is the best and most genuine Italian food in Singapore. One evening I could see into the kitchen and the supervision, care and expertise was obvious. Chef Domenico, from Italy, takes obvious pride and pleasure in ensuring the highest standards, as well as a warm welcome. My favourite so far is the Linguine Sughe D'Magre but I have loved every dish, even the mixed salad which was deliciously fresh. The atmosphere and look is casual but stylish. My only complaint is the corkage fee at $70 per bottle is at top end of the scale. But overall I think Ciao is outstanding and I will be returning often
