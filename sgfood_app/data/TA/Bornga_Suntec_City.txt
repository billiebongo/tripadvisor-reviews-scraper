Attentive service at the suntec outlet. Food can get a tad pricey if you order any of the meat dishes

I have been to bornga several times, and this proved to be the most disappointing visit. we ordered bbq beef, pork and ginseng chicken soup. the ginseng chicken was a bit on the dry side.
4
The food is good especially on the meat. Except there are shortage of staff which service is bit slow.
4
The vegetable tray remains impressive in terms of variety and freshness. A bit more expensive then the rest but Bornga remains as the family favorite : )
4
The service is very good. Especially when we were just chatting among ourselves saying it will be good to have cooked garlic, the staff straight away cooked one portion for us without us even requesting
4
Went there for dinner with 4 people. The menu offers something for everyone, it does not come cheap though. Service is ok but you feel they don't really care about you. The music is a bit too loud - you have to yell at each other to make a conversation

Great selection of Korean food BBQ at your table or order from a great variety of offerings Recently went for lunch and ordered the seafood which came with 7 sides and rice including tea total bill was 42 sing dollars High quality full of flavors at a great price ... definitely a repeat for Korean

 The meat never fail. Soy pork is very good so is the seafood jigae. Pancakes & Jap chae so so as not much favour, can be better. Been to vivo branch & the service was very good. Suntec branch service abit lacking maybe under staff the evening I went.

I had a trip recently to SG and one of my friends recommended this place. Been craving for a korean meal far too long, so its a desperate time. Anyhow, without expectations I went there with my friends and boy the staffs were really quick - from taking and serving our orders. Kimchi soup is a wow and samgyeopsal is very good
5
My experience in bornga was amazing, im so delighted on the food they served, how fresh and delicious they are. The staff will welcomed u with a smile, very polite, and accommodating. I really had a great dinner in bornga and a recommended place for the diners to visit. ‚ù§

Boba pork, kimchi soup and pancake were very nice. The price was a bit expensive. The restaurant has some good staff.
3
Overall average rating for food & service.
The ginseng chicken soup lacks the taste of ginseng and was bland. The steam egg was abit too salty.
4
The beef was good, with free flow of side dishes. The staff also help us to cook.
overall experience was excellent
4
Good & fast service. The staff also helped us to bbq our food. Food was yummy & good ventilation in the restaurant.
4
We visited the eatery just before weekday lunch hour, the set meal was value for money but the wait staff was kind of slow in refilling the drinks. Other than that the food is yummy.
5
Had a great Korean food at borgna !made an reservation and was promptly served with foods and sides dishes was great too!
4
the only thing that is rather upsetting is there is too many beef in the menu.
pork and seafood were much lesser but they are yummy food!!!
3
The restaurant was very packed during lunch time, maybe that's why the beef short rib soup was sold out even I was there at 12.30pm. Went there because of the beef short rib soup so was a little disappointed. Hope they can have more portion of it to avoid disappointment. Overall, lunch set is nice & value for money
4
Food is good and they grilled them for you. Service is not bad. Just that they do not automatically provide a jar of ice water (most Korean bbq restaurant do provide without asking). Anyway, we did ordered tea, just that the kids need a lot of water and they have to ask for refills
3
We had set lunch which was good but the a-la-carte pancake was not yummy with too much flour. The meat was almost not there. The plum drink that came after meal was good though a tad too sweet.
4
ordered pancakes and their fried vermicelli but no sides dishes served..
the usual side dishes are served only if u ordered BBQ meat.. and min 2 portions of meat (same/different is allowed)..
but the side dishes are nice and refillable!
5
The service was great. The waitress was kindly to guide us in the sauce usage. Although the BBQ vegetable was misssed out but overall still a pleasant meal experience.
5
Excellent quality they deliver. Goes here quite often with my Asian and Western clients. All satisfied 100%. Although not perfect for drinking. (Too bright)

Overrated. Low quality food. Tasteless or simply spicy.
Just go to crystal jade Korean BBQ for better food.
Kimchi soup with 2 slices of tofu and 2 slices of pork ribs... Hmmmmmmm.....
5
Food is delicious (the premium beef is very tasty) & service is attentive. Kimmy helped to arrange to surprise my friend with a birthday cake. Thank you for everything.

Always wanted to try Korean barbecue in Singapore to see if the taste is the same as what I had in Seoul. Bornga is as good as they say. Quality and quantity is good enough to revoke memories of my only trip to Seoul.
4
We shared two spicy seafood tofu soup (sundubu jjigae, please pardon me if I spelt it wrongly) - Smaller portion than some other restaurants, but we loved it (hence the double order).We also ordered a BBQ Bulgogi (beef) with glass noodles, mushrooms, beef, and more. This was particularly tasty and quite an interesting experience. Service was ok, prompt. The banchan (side dishes) are great !! Sometimes they have a mashed sweet potato banchan dish which is probably my favourite.

We frequented Bornga Suntec many times (weekday evening) and was always pleased with the food & services. But this particular visit on Friday evening was a thoroughly disappointed one. The place was understaffed. Instead of grilling the meat on our table, it was done in the kitchen. Not that we've anything against the kitchen but the results was overly cooked & "smoky" meat. Perhaps they didn't change the burnt grille or perhaps the fire was too heaty.
5
A craving for Korean barbecue means, for our family, a trip to Bornga. The subtly-marinated thinly sliced meat is grilled and eaten rolled up in a lettuce with slivers of fresh garlic, slices of spring onions, and teaspoonfuls of sauce. A side order of Haemul Samjang completes this heavenly (and rightfully decadent) feast. Tip: Walk over to nearby Hoshino Cafe for excellent hot and iced coffee to cap the meal
4
We had the bbq. The meat was wonderfully marinated, not too saltish. The service staff was good, though some looked a bit flustered due to high volume. Ventilation was good too, my hair and clothes did not smell too strongly.
5
Good service and food! But alittle pricy . 2 person cost us $95.. Order 2 potion of 200gm meat coz it's a minimum order. Plus a bowl of herbal chicken soup
5
Went last wkend with family. 3rd time visting. Nice place for gathering. Comfortable atmosphere. Will visit again
4
Their signature beef was very tender and flavourful. Service is good as they will help to cook so you wouldn't get so smelly. Side dishes are not bad too.
5
The bbq meat and appetiser presentation was excellent. The staff will bbq the meat for you. The bibimbap and kimchi soup were delicious!
5
The delicious food were of Korean standard and service staff were also very attentive. Will be back again!

By now we have all tried various kinds BBQ within or outside Korea. Some are better than the others but the key differences are quality and quantity. The taste itself is largely the same. When Bornga tries to put the BBQ on the pedestal and hype up its specialty, the results are predictably disappointing. Pls don't get me wrong, the food is not bad, and the service is decent but I can't tell whether there is anything unique about this BBQ restaurant from hundred of others in Singapore ..

Visited 29/7/16. You need to order at least 2 meats for BBQ. Served with a long tray of greens for wrapping up BBQ meats. Complete with 7 side dishes.Meat were nicely BBQ by restaurant's staff so you are able to taste at its best state.I have ordered the buckwheat cold noodles-soupand it taste awesome.Overall dining experience was very good. The only set back was, there are no refill for side dishes. Not sure if they provide refill for side dishes (as other Korean restaurant do provide). Otherwise I will rate it excellent. My meat cost me $60++ and my cold buckwheat noodles cost $15++. Total $80plus for 2 person

The Suntec City branch was comfy and does not reek of BBQ smell. Good service from the attentive wait staff. Reason I visited Bornga was for the quality BBQ food and definitely very satisfying. We had the friendly staff doing the BBQ. So all we had to do is relax and eat. Good spread of appetiser and free flow vegetable for wrapping the meats. We had the BBQ beef, pork belly and prawns. The Seafood Pancake was surprisingly smooth and good! Korean rice cake with seafood was spicy and wonderful. Hope to go back to Bornga again... but need some time to save up... :

We decided to have an early dinner at Bornga with our family of 8. The restaurant staff informed us that there's no table that can fit us all. Their table at most can sit 6 pax. She suggested that we sit at separate tables which we are not keen. At that time the restaurant was not packed and the staff offered us to dine in their private room, with minimum spending of$500.00. Upon hearing, we decided not to dine at Bornga and let them lose out on 8 pax revenue.
