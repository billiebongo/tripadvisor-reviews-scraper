Excellent value for set lunch ($29 for 3 courses). This place never fails to impress me with their creative menu. Not forgetting the excellent service from Sharmini who also recommended a great wine pairing with my food.

It was cold in the ambiance. The staff though very attentive, not warmth. The menu was limited & over priced.

Great food except for the open kitchen concept, the smell was over powering. The roast chicken could have been a little bigger.

Lovely dining experience though it was lunch. Creative food with interesting flavor combinations but it worked. Compliments to the young chef!
Will return to dine and hopefully there will be a valet service then, as finding a park is a nightmare.

Really good value lunch sets. We order one of each of the three appetizers and main courses to share between the three of us. Each every dish is amazingly done with a touch of modern gastronomy. Pea soup has a hint of smokey flavor. Squid and the pork are tasty. Main dishes are finished within seconds. Roasted chicken is tender juicy with glazed heirloom vegetables. Mushroom pasta is creamy rich. The beef short rib is so tender and delicious! Desserts are okay - we only ordered the kiwi blue cheese and strawberry cream. Good presentation. Services is quite impressive as well. Will def come back for the degustation dinner or other business lunches.

Was a Saturday night and restaurant fairly empty. They have a set menu with variable number of courses that can be matched with wines. Nice open kitchen. If the duck is on I would highly recommend it. Interesting combinations of Flavours and textures in many of the dishes. Good date restaurant

Was disappointed with the uni dinner which I understand was a special dinner event.1st course of murasaki uni - did not taste so fresh but it could be the profile.2nd course of bafun uni was better, sweeter and fresher.3rd course was baby corn in uni paste. Wait a minute- uni paste? What's that? At the end of he day it was just a plate of grilled cheap baby corn that could have been sourced from a can. Felt rather short changed as I could not taste the uni at all, given the stingy few drops of paste.Service by now was getting slower and slower to the point the next table who were 2 courses ahead is now waiting for the same course.4th course was a let down. The scallop was either frozen or overlooked or both. The street scallop in Hokkaido tasted better.Final course, the finale, I guess was so bad the young guy at the next table muttered aloud 'disgusting!'. I don't blame him. It was called ebi-glass noodles. I imagined some prawns with tasty seasoned glass noodles. Instead I got soggy glass noodles with dried shrimp - the type you can find the Chinese provision shop or even Daiso.All the bad, was countered by a team of really hardworking staff. Nuff said. Won't be coming back. Even if the meal is complimentary

During the first two weeks of October, the three of had two wonderful and fun meals at Sorrel. The food is creative and very, very tasty! The service is of the highest caliber and very, very friendly. Forget the "celebrity chef" restaurants ( Wolfgang Puck, Batali, Bouley) and head to Sorrel

I have been to Sorrel a number of times and found the cooking to be very good. Pricewise was on the high side but for the quality I was ok for the occasional indulgence. Brought my team there this time and they have reduced portion sizes considerably so we were all hungry after the set lunch meal. Tried to give constructive feedback on this as I liked the restaurant but was told by the chef that other diners were fine with the portion sizes. Given there were only 3-4 tables full during the entire lunch I find it hard to believe. People just don't come back if they leave hungry. Go if you want to have a taste but be prepared to go to McDonald's after to fill your belly.

The food at Sorrel was amazing. Chef Johnston Teo & his team were fantastic. Restaurant Manager Muhaimen and his team was such a delight. I highly recommend coming to Sorrel and trying out their lunch & dinner menu.

The service staff hardly smile. The food taste alright and not much surprise. For the same value or less, I've tried much better ones.

attentive staff and an imaginative menu. Worth a repeat visit. Decor looked a little thrown together but not a major issue

We had the 5 course dinner set on 16th of Oct.I liked: Cooking and seasoning were generally done well. Ingredients were interesting and complemented each other. Amuse bouches were a nice touch. Service was friendly, polite and efficient (they did a good job).I did not like: We were still peckish after our main course so I asked for more bread (we had had one serving of bread prior to this). Our request was flat out refused. I felt like our needs and preferences were ignored / not respected / not considered. While we do not expect a free lunch, bread costs relatively little to produce and its something most other restaurants would oblige - a reasonable request in my opinion.The chef's policy was apparently not to serve bread once the main course is done. Could not think of a reason why this policy made sense. If it was the chef's professional pride in the order of his set and the way that the flavours are set out over the course of the meal or if it was due to decorum, I would think that this should not surpass the needs of a customer. If budgetary concerns, the service charge should notionally cover it. If supply of materials or staff, the restaurant was a third empty so this should not be an issue.What I am sure of, is that I will not be returning to this establishment. Nor will I recommend it. It left a bad taste of hubris in my mouth

This is 4* with encouragement since it is a new eatery. It was a week night and 30% full. The concept is good: Gourmet east west fusion, properly plated but not stuffy formal atmosphere. Who needs to subsidize expensive decor that depreciates faster than double timed accounting calls for. But then once you relax on the decor you need the food to punch above its weight. There is fine tuning to be sure but the food here is not memorably good - yet. The dining scene here is saturated with fusion even without calling it fusion. Is it as good as Corner House? Nope. So continue to refine your dishes. You may get there

Fantastic night out. A lot of passion can be seen from the young and energetic crew waiting on the tables as well as cooking in the kitchen. Food was delicious and big on textures and flavours, execution of the food was exceptional ( no head chef barking out orders incessantly at all the other chefs), service was seamless. Get a seat at the counter to watch the kitchen action.

My friend and I were both very impressed by the freshness and quality of the ingredients, and how the combinations of flavours and textures unfolded and collaborated with one another. For the price point, the dinner tasting menu has amazing value, something rarely seen in Singapore. The service was also very friendly.

Ordered the 7 course tasting menu, was not disappointed. The food was well conceived, with genius moments like the wagyu + smoked onion vs confit egg yolk, stunning crab and tarragon, and lots of little surprises in the snacks/amuse bouches/palate cleansers. The wine pairings were so-so, not to my taste generally although the wines themselves were fine. Service was attentive and helpful, while our seats were at the bar with a fascinating view into the kitchen. Really fun to talk to the people preparing the food which makes it all the more entertaining an experience. Would visit again.

Have been to Sorrel twice, I liked it so much. The dinner was delicious and I've been fortunate to have good dinners in places like San Francisco, New York and Toronto. The meal is beautifully presented and certainly lives up to what you see on the plate. The lemon and black sesame dessert is a favourite and must try. Service was attentive but not obtrusive and the dÃ©cor lends itself to good conversation rather than shouting

So we didn't have a good first impression. We couldn't find parking and when we turned up 45 minutes late from our reservation, there was one other table and we almost thought they were not going to serve us. All this melted away when we tasted the menu. It was interesting because there were only two options - either the 5 course menu or the 7 course menu. The 5 course menu didn't seem very interesting so we started our 7 courses at 9pm. It was truly amazing The first course was this endamame - crunchy mix with the creamy fromage blanc - then suddenly there was the twist with the wasabi. What a burst of flavour! Second course was interesting because they had the sea urchin and toufu which had similarly flavours with the crunchy toasted seaweed Third dish was langoustine but you don't really see it - because its hidden underneath all these crunchy prawns and this perfect blend of vegetables Fourth course was veal with the chesnut and the sweetbread and this sweet beetroot - too bad the restaurant was a bit dark because I am sure it would have been a completely colourful dish. Main dish was the wagyu beef, foie gras and sweet peppers - well executed but the most ordinary of the night. Every dish before this had been exquisite in taste, completely delicious and full of creativity and imagination. Two desserts - chocolate and chocolate AND rhubarb and green tea. I normally have to admit that I don't like deserts but this one made sure that it wasn't too sweet so again it was very well done. I have eaten in so many fine dining restaurants But this one was truly memorable because it was so creative and the juxtaposition was unusual as it was delicious. Certainly worth returning again and agai
