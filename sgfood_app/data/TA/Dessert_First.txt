A must visit for my family almost every weekend. We especially love the durian shaved ice which was topped with real D24 durian meat!

Thanx to a friend for bringing me to this place. The desserts here were delicious. Prices were ok. The durian and mango snow ice desserts were to die for. Will be back again very soon with the family; my kids would definitely love the desserts.

Small shop space, cozy setting. Specializes in desserts such as Chua Bing (shaved ice). Tried the mango and durian flavors of shaved ice, as well as their waffles, which were great.

If you like snow ice, this is the place to be in Singapore. The restaurant serves only dessert and nothing else. The furnishing was spartan with just rows of tables set up like a cafeteria. The chairs are not particularly comfortable. The idea is for you to finish your dessert and then leave so others can take their turn. On weekend evenings, this place is crowded especially since the place is small. There is no air conditioning but it is OK since you are having icy desserts anyway. Depending on your preference, any of their snow ice dessert is good

The place was packed by patrons.We were seated deep inside, right next to the toilet.The place was alright until the person using the toilet inside came out and somehow the door could not close properly from the outside.We ordered the durian snow ice to cover up the stench.However, it did not.It was a pity because the dessert did tasted good.Hopefully they fix the toilet door soon

We dropped into Dessert First for some sweets after dinner. Place was packed but thry managed to squeeze us a table. I ordered the durian, sago and pomelo iced dessert. After all, might as well try something different. I do like durian after all. I did not expect much but was very pleasantly surprised. The dessert was delicious! I think I will try it again next time I am in Singapore

We had already had our main meal and a few drinks elsewhere and where walking back to our hotel. It was hard to miss the mass of people, mostly teens, who were queuing outside. This obviously the place to go for deserts in Liang Seah Street.We decided to see what all the excitement was about. The waitress found us a table for three and showed us the menus which were in the shape of place mats.I highly recommend this dessert only restaurant as a fun, trendy place to visit for dessert

In a short time since end of Feb, I have visited this place twice. It is located opposite of bugis junction so it is very easy to find location. The place is crowded during weekend. Have tried its durian and mango shaved ice before. Mango is not so sweet but taste average but the best is the durian shaved ice. It come in a very big portion so friends can shared together. There is actually real durian toppings plus a durian ice cream and the sauce poured over the shaved ice is make of durian. For durian lover is just wow wow wow. Price is cheap for a big bowl of desserts, highly recommended and definitely must visit

Came here for something sweet after an excellent hot pot dinner - couldn't find a better place for that! It was packed but we were lucky and got a table in the back. The offer is various, quite pricy but it is worth it.Try the mango sago w pomelo - it won't cause disappointment ;)

Delicious Shaved Ice, we are staying in InterContinental and my wife found it for Durian Shaved Ice. Seems like local place but potions are huge and very tasty especially in hot weather here.

Very crowded even at night. The snow ice comes with various choices of flavor. Portion is quite big, ideal for sharing for 2 person. Should try the durian flavor.

We visited Dessert First in Singapore last week and was very pleased! I had the Mango Shaved Ice and my wife ordered the Sesame Paste with Tang Yuan. My Mango Shaved Ice was delicious.....I almost ordered a second one . i definitely recommend this place for desserts

If you like dessert with a local Asian flavor You must come to Dessert FirstMust Try :- Durian Snow ice ! Very unique and special , can't find anywhere else !! Staff are very efficient and friendly tooAs the name applies , must eat this before anything else !!

This is a tiny little shop in Liang Seah street, a few streets away from the Raffles Hotel. Although it has a range of desserts, the ones to order are the durian ones.Their "Durian Shaved Ice" which goes for S$6 consists of durian shaved ice, durian ice cream and a dollop of real creamy durian fruit itself. The combination is heavenly

The best waffle we have tried so far! Very reasonable price at abt $8 as it was a big plate and can be shared by two people. The waffle was crunchy and soft at the same time. Caramel was not overly sweet and the salt was not overpowering. Ice cream on top was really good! Not to airy as some of the commercial ice creams are. Had a consistency similar to hagen daz or ben and jerrysThey have shaved ice and snow ice. On our first visit we tried the mango shaved ice. It was good, mango flavor can be really tasted. Will try the mango snow ice next time.The sesame paste was a little bland for my liking but I guess it's a good complement to the peanut balls
