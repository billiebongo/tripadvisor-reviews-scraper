Ordered the Marutama special, gyoza and the roast char siew. The roast char siew was really good and so were the others. Well this explains why there is always a long queue. Definitely will be back.
4
We ordered a Marutama ramen and a BBQ pork Don. Both were good. A simple but memorable meal. Will return.
4
Great value with very good selection of local style Japanese street food. Ramen noodles were great. Fast and polite service
4
we were wondering around the Clarke Quay area at dinner time and came across this amazing little ramen place. it was almost full house with a Q. Long Q and full house....must be good. We were not disappointed. One of the best ramen we have had and good value for money too
5
Initially put off by the so-called chicken stock, Marutama has won me, a pricky ramen adorer, over. The broth is flavourful without the heaviness of a tonkatsu version. Asking to up the level of spiciness simply meant a larger spoonful of chilli paste being served up (which did the job!). Noodles were thin, cooked al dente but texture-wise felt like I was eating something out of an instant pack. Onsen egg was top-notched, but they don't serve any bamboo shoots as sides. Overall a worthy S$13 bowl of comfort.* Locals should understand that small ramen shops like these need to turn over tables quickly to be profitable, shame on those who linger on while the queue of want-to-be diners build up outside.

My family has the pleasure of having a casual lunch at Marutama Ramen during a recent Singapore stopover.The Yaki Char Siu was our standout entree dish. The pork serving was generous and juicy. The Gyoza were almost excellent.Service was prompt and friendly.The bill for 2 adults, 2 children was about SGB 55.00 - amazing value !!Highly recommended :

This is a casual ramen noodle that specialised in a chicken broth. This is my first time though I have heard of this place before, and is a diehard ramen fan. Found the soup and noodle to be nice but not outstanding though I liked the braised pork and the spring onions that comes with the soup. My preference is probably for a different trpe of broth and thicker noodles
4
I ordered the Marutama specials ramen - S$19 per bowl.Soup - very strong chicken broth and covered with minced veg/greens.Char siu - 3 big but somewhat thin slices. Braised pork belly - 2 thick slices.Soft egg - a complete browned egg - very soft. Once you break this egg, you see the yolk very dark orange in colour and runny. Very nice, probably the best part of the ramen! Ramen - this is almost like angel hair type ramen and not the thicker egg noodles type. It does have a good bite but I would prefer a thicker ramen and not this angel hair type. Didn't quite enjoy this.The biggest letdown was I found the entire bowl somewhat salty, including the soft egg. Admittedly my family also cook ramen at home and maybe I've gotten used to the less salt used in our home cooked dishes. Hmm... undecided. I may not come back here again. Will try other ramen shops
4
I'm a huge fan of Japanese ramen mainly the tonkotsu soup based, but recently i had the opportunity to try the Marutama Ramen which is served with Chicken Broth, this is my first attempt trying a chicken soup ramen and certainly the ramen didn't disappoint me.The highlight of this was the freshness of the chicken essence within the broth itself which was refreshing, alongside with the noodles texture which is to my liking, its rather soft and chewy, the prices here was reasonable for the quality of ramen they're serving. This restaurant is highly recommend for those who're into Japanese ramen
4
Still the best ramen chain in Singapore!The collagen rich, clear chicken soup base has been consistently good to the last drop. Makes a perfect pairing with the fresh, firm & elastic noodles and green onions.Chefs need to focus on water temperature & cooking time of the noodles to ensure it remains al dente as the standard has a tendency to vary slightly
3
I was rather disappointed with the noodles which I found too soft. I like my noodles with a little bit of spring in them! The soup was tasty though. The selection was very limited and the seating too close for comfort.
5
Great and quick service, and delicious ramen at affordable price at Liang Court, a few steps from Clare Quay. Lang Court has nice Japanese dining options, by the way, much better and much more affordable than the more tourist oriented establishments at Clarke Quay.
4
- flavourful, tasty soup and springy noodles
- not much in the way of toppings, though
- good location in a mall frequented by Japanese.
5
I love the broth that's rich yet not cloying! The noodles have a great spring in their bite & is amazing with its soft and tender char siew.
3
I used to visit monthly. Prices have increased twice over the last 1.5 years. Instead of maintaining quality of food, the broth quality has gone down. What used to be thick pork broth is now diluted and tasteless. On the last two occasions, when I flagged it up to the waitress, they gave me the "sauce" to add. Sadly, I no longer crave for this ramen, thanks to the poor food prepared. I'm unsure if there had been a change of chef or management. Will no longer recommend or bring colleagues over
3
I ordered the zenbu special ramen which apparently has pretty much everything you could ask for on a marutama ramen. To me, it was a bit disappointing since it tasted average for a supposedly special dish. The broth was quite tasteless... Noodles were okay, the best thing in it is the ajitsuke tamago.. It was half-boiled perfectly... It pretty much melted in your mouth as you take a bite... And this is pretty much what gives the 3/5 rating on this review.
4
My first time at Marutama Ramen. Liang Court has quite a few Japanese restaurants, but we chose this since my family wanted to eat ramen. There are a few ramen dishes to choose from, and only one don dish (and even then, limited in quantity per day).My wife ordered a Marutama all-in ramen, which means everything special in it. It's $19, which is cheap considering the add-ons are between $2 and $4 per side. (then again, it's always a price perception) My daughters ordered a chicken ramen and the chicken don. And a gyoza dish too.Food came pretty fast, and piping hot. We could tell the ramen is handmade. Soup base is from chicken stock, and very delicious. Both wife and child drank the whole bowl of soup. The char siu tastes great, and the lava egg is delicious. I think my family enjoyed the food very much.There's only two outlets in Singapore. I think if you want good Japanese food at very affordable prices, you can consider the Clarke Quay outlet since it doesn't seem crowded (at least at 5:30 pm on a Sunday evening). Prices range from $9 (don) to $19 (Marutama all-in ramen)
5
I wouldn't have thought a chicken broth could compare to my favoured thick pork broth but it seemed perfect. Make sure to get the spicy option as it's really not very spicy. In the "full" option, the pork slices were finely textured, there were a few lumps of other tasty pork, the egg was done perfectly and there was a huge pile of green onion. At $22, it's double what you'd pay in Japan but this is definitely one of the best ramens I've had outside Japan. Served very fast, so great if you're in a hurry or eating on your own

I had dinner at Marutama tonight after several years. I ordered the regular ramen with pork. The noodles were soft, which was to my liking, but may be considered overdone for those who like theirs al dente. The broth was also a tad too salty for my liking, though I did finish most of it. There was a generous serving of spring onions, which I thought was disproportionate to the broth and noddles. Garlic, sesame and chilli powder were provided. This are 3-4 types of ramen available, with spicy or non-spicy chicken broth options. Aside from these, they also offer some gyozas and 1-2 rice options. There is a queue during peak hours
4
I seldom take spicy food but thought of ordering the kara, aka spicy chicken soup version of the ramen after reading good reviews online. It came looking like your average non spicy version with the soup in a tonkotsu looking broth. However, the first sip was really shiok, with the spiciness coming through. The chashu melted in my mouth while the egg had a delicious golden liquid centre which was full of flavour. The thin noodles were al dente and full of bite, which delighted me with each mouthful. There wasn't the typical perserved bamboo shoots or black fungus in the soup but I think the combination of spring onions and green seaweed were tasty as well.Beside me was a Japanese couple with their own daughter and they ordered kaedama, ie more noodles twice. Could see they were enjoying the food.I went on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm and got in rather quickly without a queue. Also food get served within 5 mins of ordering and service was OK. A bowl of the kara ramen with an egg added set me back by about $17 after GST, abit more expensive than your typical chain branches. However, the quality is worth it.Definitely worth a try if u happen to be in the liang court area
5
Fabulous ramen, went for the Zenbu Nose Ramen with all the extras in and it was sublime! Service is also very good and all in worth another visit!
4
ramen was good and ramen broth was also tasty. gyoza and aji tamago were also tasty. go early since place gets filled up fast
4
Food quality has been consistent ever since we started visiting this restaurant a few years ago. Remember to order the onsen tamago together with your Spicy/Non-Spicy Ramen (you are not going to regret it).
Fantastic food at fantastic prices.
5
I went today to this restaurant since I was looking for a local restaurant. A couple of people were eating there so I just went into it with open expectations. The ramen soup I took was very nice, the staff also very open to understand my wishes. The chÃ¡ (hit green tea) is for free to the dish if you like some. Fresh chili upon request and nice roasted / dried garlic already in the table as to flavor even more the dish. I enjoyed it
5
Not a big fan of the ramen craze with all these complicated bowls. Good thing there is Marutama Ramen. Menu is limited and that's not necessarily a bad thing. What they do, they do very well. Highly recommend spicy ramen with tamago and a side order of gyoza.Service and quality is fairly consistent across branches, although level of 'spicy' may differ
4
For an outside of Japan ramen, the chefs at this place have nailed the broth making pretty much! Delicious and comes in both spicy and regular, I recommend getting the extra egg for 1.5$ and if you are hungry, more sliced pork roast for 4$. I would have loved to add fresh garlic and pickled ginger, but the condiments table side are fried garlic chips, sesame and more chili powder.
5
There are plenty of good hokkaido ramen restaurants in Singapore but I would say Marutama has the best one so far. The soup is perfectly balance, the simmered pork cheek is excellently tender and delicious. And the best thing, they also provide fried garlic on the table
4
Ramen is good prices are acceptable. The service is good. The menu contains number of variations so you have a choice how you want your Ramen. Only complain is the noodle they use is not that good. May be its me but I must say I had bette
4
It has a good following despite steep competition from other Japanese restaurants in Liang court.A variety of ramen are served here with its well boiled broth that is very delicious together with its succulent meaty pork. Eggs and seaweed are added to complement the whole works of a good ramen.To enjoy it fully you must slurp your noodles
4
~our 4th time in & out with colleagues who are pressed to get back to work in an hour~ramen is the dish folks come out here for but I take the "char siu don" everytime~the Yaki Char Siu (BBQ pork slices) is a reorder dish, you just can't stop at oneAlways good for a quick bite :
4
I am not a big fan of Japanese cuisine. But the pork belly ramen I have had here has kept me hooked onto this place. No other place has matched the ramen I have had here. Thank you Marutama.
5
Recommend featured ramen on the menu. The spicy one is worth a try for those who like spicy. I ordered mine with tamago and char sui. My friend likes the daikon in the side dish menu.
5
The tamago (egg) is a must to try! Best ramen tamago so far! Love their char siew too~ so soft that melt in my mouth!
3
Not bad. I think Kinton in Toronto is a much better ramen place. Service was very friendly here. I left satisfied and full.
4
A tasty ramen place and the spicy levels were nice. The vegetables were just enough. A nice place to sit and with a Japanese good bye. All in all it's a good place for your ramen treat.
4
Came back here for lunch today for another visit. We ordered 1 special ramen ($18++) and 1 regular ramen ($12++) and supplemented with pickles and gyoza, which we shared between 2 adults and 1 child. Quite a generous allocation of noodles and decent char siew in the regular ramen and pork belly in the special ramen. Overall very tasty. Bill was $46 in total
5
I stumbled upon this place while walking along Clark Quay. The restaurant is located within the Liang Center mall which seems to specialize in Japanese-related goods i.e. anime, Japanese restaurants, Uniqlo, Japanese grocery etc. My goodness, the variety of Singapore malls never ceases to amaze me. Anyway, I looked at the various Japanese restaurants and normally, I gravitate to the first ramen place I see, but this time, I'm glad I held out because I happened to see this place on the upper levels near a toy shop I was checking out. (On a side note, this mall has one or two toy shops specializing in anime related toys). Singapore has a plethora of ramen places but I noticed most of them are pork based. So, when I discovered that this place specialized in chicken based broth, I was excited to try it. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed! I think what really put the ramen over the top was the dried garlic provided tableside. In the U.S., we very rarely have these condiments on the table. Actually, authentic ramen and Japanese food is such a sorry state of affairs in the SF Bay Area (in spite of a relatively sizable Japanese population). I have to go to specific areas to get my ramen fix and for sure, I haven't found a place yet that does chicken based broth. If you're near Clark Quay and want to try a different take on ramen, give this place a shot
3
I don't eat pork so I was very excited about trying a chicken broth based ramen. The broth was good, perhaps a bit too heavy/oily for my taste but it was good. Marutama Ramen offers customers the option of deciding on whether they want soft, regular or al dente noodles. I chose al dente but either they overcooked it or we have very different definitions of what al dente is. The noodles were not the least bit al dente, they were soft. Not only were they soft that they tasted that great either. For this reason unless if I'm desperately craving ramen I will not be coming back again
4
Love the chicken soup base, generous garnishing of spring union and seaweed and the sesame seeds and roadbed garlic that you can choose to add on yourself. The steamed gyoza drizzled with vinegar is delicious. So is the char shu rice.They refuse to seat you until every single member of your party has arrived. Service is swift and efficient but unsmiling
4
If you like your ramen made with delicious full bodied chicken broth, tender pork, and flavorful semi-boiled egg, coupled with an equally robust sake; you will love Marutama Ramen. Did I mention that the service was friendly and fast?Best ramen I have ever had!Cheue
4
One of decent price ramen in Singapore with authentic taste.
Quick service, good interior. Nothing to complain, since it's my hubby's favorite ramen in Singapore.
5
The spicy noodle soup tasted deliciously awesome, and the egg yolk was special. A must if you are around the area of Clarke quay. The waiters and waitresses were friendly too!
3
I've tried the Ramen but I'm not keen on Ramen having chicken-based soup. Ramen and Pork-Based soup should always go togther!However on that particular weekend, I was feeling pretty full so I ordered a mini rice dish (the name beats me now, I guess I'm getting old!) topped with 2 thick slices of Tamago, onions, and a few slices of braised pork. My partner ordered the usual Ramen. I gave it another shot and tried the soup - ok, it's triple confirmed that Ramen should always come with Pork-Based Soup!I bet no one knows there's such a dish on the menu given that they are known for their Ramen.Tip: Ladies who do not want to over-eat during their lunch hour can stop by Marutama Ramen for this mini rice dish
3
Simple menu with 4 core types of ramen ranging in price from $12 to $15 (plus GST and service). Opted for the spicy ramen which was quite reasonable and not too oily. Service was fast and staff were helpful. Easily accessible up the escalator in Liang Court
1
We heard so much about this famous ramen and decided we had to savour it...Alas... What a disappointment!! I have to say it is one of the worst I've tasted. The broth is too oily and leaves an unpleasant afterfeel in your tummy.the ramen is too soggy and there is only a pathetic slice of char sieu.i had to add pork belly and a boiled egg to make the ramen more interesting.it didnt help though.even the togarashi was not authentic.overall I felt it was a rip off as we paid about 40 bucks for two bowls of pathetic crap.ive tasted better ramen that you order from vending machines and even cup ramen tastes better.May I suggest these ramen wannabes to shape up or ship out.will never ever waste stomach space in this restaurant again.avoid it at all costs
4
We went to their Liang Court Branch. Ordered Pork Belly, Yaki Gyoza, spicy Golden Moments & 1 non-spicy Golden Moments. Golden Moments was interesting with a good balance of cabbage, char siew, mushrooms & egg. I hate veggies & was a bit intimidated looking at the heap of cabbage, but it worked quite well. Gyoza was good, but the star of the show was melt in mouth pork belly. The sauce was very good, but the belly itself was exquisite. Will return for it definitely
5
A friend ordered a bowl of ramen for me during last order. I wasn't even close to reaching then.. As I was rushing down to the restaurant, I was so worried i'll end up eating cold soggy noodles since the restaurant was closing and it was already way past the last order. Worse. will they ask us to go somewhere else for dinner because it was already past their closing time? I was so famished I couldn't imagine getting turned away and having to look for a new place for food.I was so wrong. The restaurant waited for me to reach. Then they started preparing our bowl of ramens. I was moved speechless. My bowl of ramen came piping hot, fresh, tasty and had everything I wanted in a bowl of ramen. It was perfect.Not sure if anywhere else could have recreated this same feeling
5
Have been to this restaurant for a couple of times. The ramen there is not very oily as other places and the price is also reasonable. The soup is quite salty, but it goes well with the noodles and some toppings like the roast pork slice. I find that the ramen soup here is tastefully brewed than other types which are covered with layer of lard.It is highly recommend
5
We like the ramen served here. One nice thing is you can ask for additional ramen noodle if you are still not full, this is a good option for the big eater like me. We saw it while we were in KL and we went for it as our choice for ramen in KL
1
Went to the one at Suntec City. I don't get the reviews saying it's cheap! S$14+ for noodles and ONE THIN SLICE of pork? Ripoff! Tasted very normal too. I still felt hungry after that, I had a tastier dinner of a stew full of lamb at Medz for $12
4
Food was good, not superb. Place and servings were simple. Staff was ok, didn't smile at us at all but took our orders well and delivered promptly. One try is enough for me.
3
The egg could have been cooked longer, it is too runny. Noodle is not springy enough and it turned soft after soaking in the soup. This ramen is certainly over-rated, there are better ramen else where.
4
Not a large menu, but what they do, they do well. The ramen is seriously tasty! Expect queues at dinnertime...
4
The ramen is different to the one I had in Hokkaido. The noodles are thinner and straight. However, it's not as "bouncy" as the usual ones. The broth is good, not very thick compared to other ramen joints. The cha shu is nice though, better than a number of other ramen stalls. I felt its better than the cha shu I had in Hokkaido...Basic shop with seatings very close. Basic service as well
4
I came here taken by my cousin, 5 of us went there. we went to the one across the clarke quay, the mall called the central I think. We were lucky because not so many people in there. usually we have to queue to eat there, said my cousin. Marutama ramen is the famous Ramen in Singapore, I can't tell why, because The ramen just okay in my opinion.And now we have it in here, in Jakarta, Marutama Rame
4
Maurtama is my go-to place for ramen on the weekdays. Good chicken broth, nice veggies, and straight noodles cooked to your liking. Service is also good and very efficient. Marutama ramen is not mind-boggling good or exciting enough for you to wait in line for 30 minutes, but a great place to satisfy your craving for a standard bowl of ramen
5
This restaurant caught our attention because of the line up of people waiting outside to get a table. Even though it was really busy the wait was not too long and we sat at the bar right where they were cooking the meals! The menu is simple (I think 3 main choices) plus a whole bunch of extra toppings if you feel the need to spice it up a little. I had the Chicken and Vegetable Raman and my FiancÃ©e had the spicy chicken meatball Ramen. Both were very tasty and took no longer than 5 minutes to arrive after we ordered. The service was very friendly and efficient. We didn't hang around the restaurant for long afterwards as there were still people waiting outside for a seat! The best part was our bill came to less than $30 for two people
4
Limited menu, but what they have, they do it very well. Choose from three types of ramen. Chicken broth soup, rich and flavourful. Not as salty as Ramen Santouka's. The seasoned egg is a worthy addition to the meal at $1.00. Soft-boiled inside, hard-boiled outside. Basic ramen is $12.00 but add-ons will increase the price significantly. Simple decor, basic service, food is served quickly even when the restaurant is full. Worth visiting if you're a ramen fan
3
I shan't complain about the food quality even though I do have some not so favourable comments, mainly because this is a cheap noodle outlet where I would go for a quick and simple meal.I like the texture of the ramen but not so the taste of the soup which to me is a little murky and has too strong a 'meaty' odour. I much prefer my soup to be clear
3
Broth is very rich and flavourful albeit a bit salty, ramen was springy and tasty and the signature egg was "eggcellent". But service was slow and not so friendly (maybe due to lunchtime crowd) and the tiny space meant you eat in constant noise. Go during off peak hours for a better experience
4
The ramen is ichiban! The broth is rich in texture and taste is as close as those serve in Japan. Like the half boiled egg and the char siew.
4
Love the broth and the Tamago is fantastic!
3
love the half boiled egg
3
Noodles are ok ,but the soup stock is light ,not flavory enough ,pork is abit tough
5
I recommend... Daikon, Seasoned Egg
4
One of the best Ramen in Singapore!
3
The soup stock seems to taste better on the weekends rather than at lunch on weekdays. Must try: Yaki Char Siew (side order) and Dashimaki Tamago (side order).
2
Frankly, lots of MSG and that's why the plain water is free of charge. Expensive version of instant noodles!
4
ridiculously expensive for ramen. soups are salty. but the char siew is goOOOd!
3
This peculiar Ramen shop only serves two different types of Ramen - the Aka Ramen and the Marutama Ramen. I ordered both for the sake of trying, since it's the only dishes available on the menu. The Aka Ramen's soup base is made of seven kinds of nuts though I'm not entirely sure which seven. The soup is slightly spicy and the ramen springy, just like how good ramen is supposed to be. Still, I personally preferred the Marutama Ramen which soup base is just chicken. Though less fancier than the previous one, its flavour does not pale in comparison. Delicious and aromatic, I finished up the soup and Ramen in no time and I'm those who usually don't finish my soup! Worth another go again though I wish they would expand their menu
