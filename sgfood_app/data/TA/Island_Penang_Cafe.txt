Penang fried Kway Teo is my all time favorite there and Chicken wing is a must to go as a side dish.
No service charges and GST is additional attraction to the dinners.

Family decided to try out this place and since it was a Sunday, it was a 10 minute wait.Still the food was up to par. Like everybody said,, the Char Kway Teow was the best for me. The braised pork was sos-so. The curry fish head and fried chicken was ok. Did not try the Yow Yee Ong Choy, but, have to do it another day.Service was good, and polite. Finally, Chendol was also ok, but, I rather stand in the heat and have it in Penang. Price wise...it was ok, but can't really compare it dollar to dollar...or ringgit

I have been to Penang before and was most impressed with the local food: cheap and good. If you want to try them, Island Penang Kitchen is a decent place, although it is a bit expensive and the flavour is not as tasty. The prawn noodle and char kway teow are the most popular dish there. Be early for lunch or u have to queue ..

This was my first trip to Island Penang Cafe (their card says Island Penang Kitchen), but sure which comes up on Google, but it is walking distance from my house. Everytime I walk by this place it is PACKED! Last night I could see a few tables empty, so figured it was time to investigate. WOW, food was AMAZING! I had a pork dish, a chicken dish, and a vegetable dish. All were 100% delicious! WOW! The prices were reasonable (very) and they even had a few western dishes to keep the kids happy. We will be back!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good job

We heard about this place and decided to try it out. Tried several items, char kway teow (which was really good), prawn noodles (very good), lor bak (average), fish curry (ok), chicken curry (very good) and the chendol is great. All around, highly recommended as I have gone back twice and will return

I paid several visits to this cafe in the past month. You can get the authentic Penang food right here in Singapore. To get here, take a train to Clementi MRT station. Then take bus 201 to West Coast Road and alight at the bus stop before West Coast Plaza.The cafe is opposite West Coast Plaza right behind the West Coast Community Centre., The best thing about this place is that it is accessible by bus and by car. You can park at the HDB carpark nearby and there are ample parking lots.The cafe sells the best Penang food like cuttlefish kangkong, babi ponteh, Penang rojak, fried tauhau, curry fishhead and even the famous chandol. You get value for your money and the price is reasonable for such good food. The food is finger licking good. Service is excellent. The waiters and waitresses are polite and they go all out to please the customer. My advice is: Die , die must try. You will love the food here and come back for more. However, on weekends, you may have to wait longer as the queue is very long

Being a Penang lang living in Singapore for more than 18 years, i have always been hunting around for my hometown food since i arrived but sadly few have met my lofty tastebuds standards. I had high expectations before i stepped into Island Penang Kitchen and i am glad to report that it did not disappoint. We ordered the typical staple of char koay teow, assam laksa, hokkien mee, beÄºachan chicken for finger food and of course the cendol for dessert. Everything was good but i must point out that the noodles used in the laksa were a bit disappointing from the smoother Penang ones. Nevertheless it was not bad.A good place to satisfy one's craving for Penang hawker food and i reckon i will visit it quite often. Price is very reasonable and portions good

This place fills up completely by 12 noon, and there is a long queue outside the restaurant after that. It is extremely noisy and uncomfortable then. The food orders came very quickly! We were disappointed with the food quality today. The Kang kong with cuttle fish was not tasty. The Fried chicken wings had a thick batter covered with oil. The Nyonya fried noodles had no zing, and the Char Kway Teow was lack lustre too. This was disappointing as we had a fabulous meal here many months ago, and had returned with high expectations of enjoying the same

Found this place as it was a few shops down from a great nail salon (Nailly). It gets busy slightly before noon, but queues move pretty fast.Very delicious food, served at fast speed. Recommend the fried kway teow, cuttlefish kang kong, curry pork, prawn noodle, and curry fish head. Their steamed fish is pretty good too. Came here multiple times and the food never disappoints. Prices are affordable and worth it. Good place for family get togethers (but do reserve for large numbers).

and for a place like this, recommended as much as it was to us, that is a bit little. Three dots would be defensible as well - the typical tripadvisor problem because "very good" is too much and "average" too little. Perhaps the best indoors restaurant in this West Coast area, it strangely tries to look like a chain restaurant, even systems gastronomy, while it isn't. The drinks were really good, the food was good, at worst adequate, but in the end, very normal. We liked especially the vegetables. Meat quality is very good (chicken, pork etc.) Prices are appropriate without being cheap. Tables are *very* close to each other. Staff was attentive and even friendly but not accommodating and gracious to the extent that would create true hospitality. In sum, if one is in the neighborhood anyway, one can go here no problem, but I would leave it at that

We ordered a few dishes; some hits and misses. Generally we had pretty good experience overall. Prawn noodle soup - it seemed watered down with a salty tinge. Had high expectation of this. Lor Bak was ordinary but the tofu was amazing. The sauces did not impress either. Char Kway Teow did had wok-hei and good balance of tastes. The bean sprouts were plentiful and well-executed too. Cuttlefish KangKong - another well executed dish. Penang Laksa was flavorsome though I would have added more Prawn paste. Like the Assam-ness and taste. Prawn paste pork - no brainer. Difficult to mess up this dish. Chendol - I was pleased to see the large red beans. Overall a good desert to finish off the meal. Personally I would love to have more gula Melaka. I must say that the service was very friendly and attentive. The team works like family members.

This restaurant is just located at a corner and parking is very convenient; right in front of the restaurant. The food served here are typical Penang food like char Kwan teow, etc.Food wise is above average but not great. In view of the price, I really think it's worth it to try

Great value for money... rustic eating establishment, so expect it to be a little noisy when crowded. The Fried kway teow and Assam Laksa are delicious, and each table is equipped with a bottle of prawn paste so you can add it to the assam laksa, according to your personal taste. Have visited several times and the Deep fried chicken wings never disappoint. However the Lala clams dish leaves much to be desired

Visited the place a few days before and realised that it was a place that would crowd up quickly. For our 1st dine-in, we arrived at 6.30 pm to beat the crowd and was welcomed by all the staff. Yes, we were the 1st to arrive. It was an self-ordering system with paper and pen - the only bummer was the server spoke only Cantonese which my poor husband couldn't comprehend.The food was pretty authentic and the more popular dishes were the Hokkien mee, laksa, rojak etcWe loved the special hokkien mee and the stock had lots of punch. Pig skin wasn't my favourite but was ok with you. On our 2nd visit, we had the Penang cha kway teow. We also ordered the seafood mee goreng and when we asked the server which was which, she said the difference was in the noodles....taste wise, I agree with her. Pick one, you don't need both.The Penang rojak was good - lots of peanuts and shrimp paste and they were generous with those.Though many raved about the bean skin fried with salt and pepper and came with a chilli dip, I didnt find it fantastic.We had the 3 sour plum drink....you definitely need the sugar syrup unless you have a high sour tolerance but it was nice.The nutmeg drink was recommended but didnt really like the slight medicinal taste though it had some nutmeg in it.We had the long beans and it did taste nice and crunchy.The chendol was something everyone claimed not to be missed, We didnt think it was but I must agree that they are generous with the gula melaka and beans.The ambience - its not much space but if you don't mind doing al fresco dining aka minus the aircon, it is more comfortable sitting but you sit next to parked cars. The place fills up quickly so either go early or late. They close at 9.30 pm and on alternate Tuesdays - check website for days.Visited the website and it looks like a staff oriented place. The servers were quick, pleasant and polite. They had a mish mash of old and young servers - all equally nice

This place is very far out of the way for tourists and therefore you will only see locals. And therefore this entire West market breathes out a special atmosphere. It is rather less organized than the touristy food courts in or near the center. But you can really find some very interesting local specialities. We visited a restaurant with the name: Bao Gong XO Fish Head Bee Hoon. The garlic spicy crab is very special, and complements very well the more well known pepper crab and chili crab dishes. Especially recommended are the baby squids in honey and the abalone with spinach, although the latter dish is somewhat expensive. But really the best dish they have is the fish head soup, watch the bones though

Went there for dinner with a friend. it"s in a HDB shophouse near Sheng Siong in West Coast Clementi. We ordered the fried kway teow and assam laksa to share. The laksa was good, rice noodle was different from what we usually had, the gravy was thick and tasty. The fried kway teow was good too, came with a couple of prawns, lap cheong, bean sprouts and pieces of crispy lard. Good wok hei. Price of each dish was $5.50. There was air conditioned seating area. A good place for a quick meal

I am a born and bred Penangite now based in Singapore. I have been searching high and low for great Penang food. Finally I found Island Penang Cafe. I have to stay their Char Koay Teow and Chendol are even better than some kopitiam in Penang. Kudos to the chef and this had been our bi-weekly spot to go. Reminder to also order the nutmeg drink :

Had lunch with friends and each of us ordered a different dish. I ordered the Penang char kway teow which was slightly different from local version - thinner flat rice noodle and without thick sweet sauce. There was lots of sinful but tasty lard and wok-hei which makes it a satisfying meal if you are yearning for a Penang flavor.My partner had the hokkien prawn Mee in soup which was tasty too. However portion may be not be sufficient for big eater.We had the Lor Bak plate (pork wrapped in bean curd skin) to share. Dish is standard fare, can't really go wrong.Prices are reasonable for Aircon seating, average $6-10 per pax if sharing. Lunch time tends to be crowded.

So do prepare enough cash for payment since they only accept cash. Only of the best place for Penang food. I love the Ayam Laksa, it is the best ever and only cost $5. I have ordered twice in the first time. Other food are nice too. They have indoor and outdoor, spacious enough for small family gathering. For big sized gathering, maybe it is not a good choice since they don't have big round table

I've lived and I visit Penang regularly, this place is the real deal. I've been eating at Island Penang since it opened. Nice indoor restaurant but it does fill up in the evening. I recommend the Char/Fried Kway Teoh, it is the real deal unlike many Singaporean places that claim they are authentic. The Thai style beancurd is about the best you will find anywhere. The Chendol is superb and very refreshing. They have real nutmeg juice and a unique lime, lemon, sour plum drink. Very affordable prices and highly recommended
