Not sure why there is always a long queue for lunch. Ordered the chirashi don, I personally prefer my raw fish on sushi rice instead of normal rice

We enjoyed this restaurant. From the moment you walk in your are well taken care of. Everyone was treated in a warm and friendly manor. The sushi was great. Some unusual choices for us. We would go back.

Really love the chirashi don, value for money. Very tasty and sashimi are really fresh, even better when you add extra serving of uni.

My best restaurant experience is here. This is my first time in an open kitchen restaurant like this. Food are excellent. Since you step in, you could feel of something nice. Staff are very attentive. Service is great and food are amazing. I will definitely come here again. Anyway, i would live to have the restaurant open a little longer than 10 PM.(last order is too early for me

One of my best experiences in a restaurant ever. Everything was just perfect. The ambience is brilliant, cozy and you are able to see the chefs prepare your food! The service was more than wonderful, always welcoming, explaining the dishes and giving recommendations. And the food... is just amazing, nothing that I can say will be able to explain how delicious it is. Totally in love with Koji and coming back for sure to try their Omakase!

It's a standard sushi bar for grabbing a quick bite during office rush lunch hours. We were the first 2 walk-in customers. We ordered Sashimi Set (Chirashi Don @ Sgd18++, add sgd1++ for brown rice). It comes with complimentary garden salad & miso soup. Garden salad was pre-arranged (just squeezed the dressing & ready to serve, without cling wrapped & non-refrigerator), and Sashimi was marinated with soy sauce in advance kept in a sealed plastic container (refrigerator). Brown rice served has turned cold, and hard. To me, its like a 'fast-food' with quick platting, certainly over-priced & over-rated. By the time we finished our lunch, the place was fully occupied & absolutely noisy ! Ps. They only accept Visa/Master, but NOT Amex.

Had a wonderful Omakase experience at Koji Sushi. Omakase in Japanese means "I entrust to you" and it is the Japanese dining culture whereby you let the chef decide what dishes to prepare for you, based on the fresh ingredients that the kitchen has brought in for the day. The small plates prepared was excellent in taste and well presented. The chef prepares the food directly in front of us, explains each item presented and even check if our stomachs are filled at the end. The sushi was really fresh and good. You will need 1.5-2hrs to enjoy the whole experience, the chef is attentive and time the preparation of each dish so that it is not too hurried. You will need to make advanced reservation for this. They have 2 price levels to choose from and they will call ahead to check if you do not take any specific food ingredients. However do take note that drinks are not included in the price quoted for the Omakase set, you will need to order drinks separately

My wife and I had the Omakasi menu as a special treat last week, I wasn't sure if it would prove worthwhile / justify the cost but it went beyond expectations. The whole experience lasted nearly 3 hours during which time we were able to witness the chefs who were dedicated just to us, compose the many dishes with artistry and panache. Would recommend this to anyone

My 4th time here over 2 years span. The initial times was great and very satisfying. You taste the freshness of the fish and the warm rice along with prefect drizzle of the dressing. This time was a little disappointing, everything is okay but the dressing for the rice is not up to the expectation. I had to dig through my sashimi to find the potion of rice that was drizzled when I remembered it was well distributed previously. Will still come if I don't hv a alternative but definitely not a crave for place

I am one big fan of chirashi but at Koji Sushi Bar, they call it Donburi. I decided to bring my wife and god son for a simple dinner on my birthday ton Wednesday night. The place is fully packed even on a weekday evening and we were excited and was looking forward to a great evening of great food. We were seated beside the cash register and quite obviously the boss lady (I assume) was guarding her position at the register. We ordered a sushi set (5 pieces), a sashimi set (10 pieces) and 3 donburii (2 salmon avocado and 1 salmon and roe). The sashimi and sushi were fresh and within our expectation. We were pleasantly surprised by the generous proportion of salmon to rice and the good balance of all the ingredients. The Donburi is exceptionally good and you could savour that the salmon has been marinated with some sauces and yet retain that freshness of fish when you chew on it. Just as the Donburi was served, the boss lady informed us that the wasabi they serve is fresh wasabi and should not be mixed with soy sauce. It is best consumed after stir mix with the salmon and other ingredients with the rice. Unfortunately, wasabi does not bode well with me especially when taken without the soy sauce. I have sensitive nose and I will sneeze none stop when taken on its own. So, i took the wasabi from my Donburi and mix it with the soy sauce in a small plate. The boss lady observing me "not following her recommendation', told me that I should eat without the soy sauce because they serve "fresh wasabi". I ignored her and continue to have it the way I am comfortable to handle the food. In less than 5 minutes, she took another eye shot at me and told me straight in my face, "We served fresh wasabi and the way you are eating it is incorrect. You are wasting the fresh wasabi". I did not rebut her because i did not want to upset my dinner, especially it is my birthday dinner.After we left the restaurant, my god son ask me"why didn't you tell her off that it is the customer's prerogative to how he likes his food to be consumed. By repeating three times with those tone and unkind words is really bossy and rude."I told him, "She is a Dictator, I pity her.....

A trendy small sushi joint, packed by local youngsters.
We had the sashimi bowl with brown rice and the salmon bowl. Everything was excellent, tasty, fresh. We strongly recommend the sashimi bowl.
Also very nice and professional staff.
Highly recommended!

Sashimi bowl is a must!
I used to go there during lunch breaks, fresh food, fair size, very good price quality.

I usually write a lot in my reviews. Not this time. You got to try this when in Singapore. Mind you might need reservations.

Highly recommend their Chirashi bowl! The place is always packed with people, so do make reservations in advance! :)

Chirashi bowl was incredible and great value for money as well - highly recommended! Worth noticing that the restaurant is closed between 15 and 17 :)

The sashimi don is amazing and the sashimi is damn good too. Seating is a bit crammed but all in all it's a nice place.

Decent for a lunch - the sets are good value and the quality is not too bad. They serve the sushi with more than the usual amount of rice. Worth coming here for lunch but they do get very packed - you can also call for takeaway and pick up

Cosy little sushi restaurant with fresh sushi at a reasonable price.I've never seen these sushi bowls before, I had Tuna Bowl and it was amazing, very filling and lots of Tuna in there. Nice atmosphere too, and good service. I suggest booking if you want to sit inside. Only downside is it was a little cramped with not much room to move, but this standard for Japanese sushi bars I guess, and is by no means a deal breaker.A Japanese gem in heart of SG that won't break the budget.Strongly recommended

Super long queue everyday! It was my first time to have lunch alone there and I was very satisfied with everything! The service is excellent and made me feel at home. I ordered an Eel Rice Bowl Set with a appetizer of Tuna in only totally 24 SGD. The appetizer was freshing and the don was very nice with well cooked unagi! I was impressed and hope I will have another chance to try other dishes

I patronise Koji quite frequently as their Chirashi bowl is truly outstanding, especially for the $17 pricetag. After hearing good things about the dinner omakase from friends and reading other reviews, my partner and I decided to give it a try. From what we were told, omakase sets ran from 68 - 85++ and only recently had raised its price to a max of $100 per set. We made a reservation on the phone for 2 pax omakase, and ensured that the price will not exceed $100 by asking if the sets are $100 each. The person confirmed. We were served an appetiser, sashimi (4 slices), sushi (4pc) crab dish (which tasted like frozen crabmeat from the supermarket), century egg tofu, soup, grilled fish, beef, 1 hotate sushi, 1 uni sushi and fruit for dessert. Some dishes were good, most were average, and most of the ingredients were not premium (save for the uni and the single slice of otoro in the sashimi plate). The waitress brought us the bill before we were done with our second last course. When we were presented with the bill, they charged us $128 for each set. Higher than any listed price that we've read or heard about. When we asked why, the waitress said that our menu consisted of a lot of seasonal items. Were they really? Because we were the only customers left and the chefs were doing the dishes preparing for closing, we did not ask further. We walked away very dissatisfied with the quality of the omakase dinner for the price paid, but the more upsetting thing was feeling like the chefs priced the items they served as they fancied. Disappointing for a place to seems to pride themselves on affordable japanese without compromising on quality
