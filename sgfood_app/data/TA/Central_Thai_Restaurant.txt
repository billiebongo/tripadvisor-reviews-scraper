Having our lunch there, food is so so only. Disappointed. Phad thai only have 2 small prawn and the chicken doesn't taste fresh.

Love that this restaurant is on the Entertainer too. The food quality is good and prices are reasonable!

I has the fried rice and it was nicely complimented by sambal with just the right amount of kick. Food was tasty but a bit too oily for my liking. Tap water was free.

If you need to satisfy your Thai food craving, head over to Central Thai for a quick fix. Had my quick fix at Changi Airport and the food was really good! Highly recommended!

The restaurant is ok but nothing especially. The service is friendly and the food ok but I wouldn't visit it again. Therefor it's to less what I'm looking for.

Our first time at Central Thai and we were not disappointed with the quick and efficient service. Food was value for money and tasted delicious.

Paid S$100 for 3 pax....2 noodle dishes - phad thai and sambal egg noodle....a bowl of red beef curry...a plate of sambal long bean with salted egg yolk & chicken, a bowl of rice and a 2 liter tower of lemongrass drink. I'd say reasonable price for a very nice ambience - by the seaside!!

We stumbled across this outlet while having our evening walk & run at the East coast park and gave this a try.We had seafood green curry, mango salad and white rice. Service was prompt, but just because they want to clear space for next customer during crowded weekend.Food best avoid if u want authentic Thai as both dish were not fresh nor commendable. Price is normal restaurant standard

We were at the Changi Airport Terminal 2 branch. It was off-peak hour so the restaurant was rather empty. Ambience was good, the waiters did not hurry us to make our choice. We had a simple meal and was quite satisfied with it. The pad thai however was quite bland, which was a disappointment, because I always judge a Thai restaurant place by how good their pad thai is! The olive rice was also not spectacular. What saved the day was the seafood tom yum, which was flavourful and generous with the content. During off-peak hours this would be a good meeting place to catch up with friends as the waiters basically leave you alone after food is served

This restaurant was a disappointment, great location by the water in East Coast Park. Plentiful packing. The issue is the food, looks like Thai food, taste like it was cooked by someone who has never eaten Thai food. Bland, tasteless, and expensive. Reminds me of the plastic food often seen outside restaurants in Japan - looks nice but fake! If you want Thai food I suggest u avoid this place.

The food was good, portions were really generous. We struggled to finish what we had ordered. The food was quick to arrive. The service was excellent â€“ staff we really nice.
4
Ambience and service was good.The steam fish and tom yum was average.Will definately come back and visit the restaurant if in the vicinity.
3
Nice food, good for travellers and large groups, though the service can be slow during peak periods.

On our first day we visited this place for dinner and as always enjoyed the thai food. I tried the papaya salad and thai chicken soup. Overall enjoyed the food and the since it was right next to our hotel, we could walk back comfortably.

Booked a table for dinner on a weekday with friends at their ECP outlet. Almost got lost finding their ECP location & got mixed up with their Siglap outlet which address is at ECP too. Love the beautiful windy night outdoor seating scenery. We was given indoor seating, huge place perfect for friends & family gathering. But was told to move to outdoor seating due to we having moonkata.We came for their halal mookata & ala carte dishes but however we preferred their ala carte dishes more than moonkata. We tried their chicken broth soup for our moonkata & true enough from writers feedback soup quite salty. Probably you might want to skip from having that soup!Delicious ala carte food & less crowd on weekdays. Price would be about the same as Thai Express. We might return again probably for their ala carte only

Went to East coast branch. The view was nice. Windy and cool. Right on east coast by the sea. Sat outside.Noticed un-swept floor with used dirty plastic spoon under the table. All the dishes were served luke warm temperature and super SALTY! I usually take salty food. But this was super SALTY even for me. The waitress served our curry dish holding it with her fingers inside the bowl. Yuk!Learned that our waitress also did not highlight the specials and ongoing promotions only when the waiter was explaining to the ang mor. Disappointed
4
Good authentic Thai cuisine served in comfort ambience. A last minute second choice that we didn't regret as the ala carte lunch turned out pretty well. The staff were friendly and kind for they even top up our dessert with more ice cream seeing that 6 of us had ordered only 2 bowls of chendol. The olive and pineapple rice were pretty good, not forgetting the taufu telur, green curry and other signature dishes. Definitely a friendly family restaurant

My husband and I had been a frequent customer of the Siglap branch as we live around the area. During our last visit, I brought in a bottle of Halal certified (logo printed on bottle) juice, as I was on a juice fast due to health condition, so that I could like to have my "dinner" with my husband. The manager approached us rudely, after we ordered our food, and told me that I am not allowed to drink the juice as this is a Halal restaurant. I told the manager that the juice is Halal certified but the she did not even bother to check. The manager assumed that I was lying and even implied for us to leave the restaurant if I don't keep my bottle of juice. Such service standard and attitude is not what we expect from Central Thai. This is the first time we see this manager on the ground and we were always served very well by Fabian during our prior visits. Pls find attached the picture (taken in the restaurant itself) of the Halal certified juice which I brought in

From Luxury girl and Hypoallergenic boy: They were life savers! Hypo boy and I were starving and worried about catching our flight at T2. The staff patiently listened to all of Hypo boy's food allergies and created dishes to suit his needs. :) He was very happy with the food and they charged us very affordable prices too. Very impressed and we will definitely come back to eat here again

My friends and I ordered the lunch special which was very worthy. $11.80++. Consists of a main dish, a tom yum soup & drinks of your choice. You may have to top up some money to get a change of the set meal. The dishes were tasty. On top of the set menu, we ordered a red ruby as dessert to share. The portion was big and just nice for both of us but very disappointing was the dessert was the worst red ruby my friend and I have tasted. The water chestnut was fully coated with flour. You can hardly taste the water chestnut. Its all mainly flour and they don't use coconut... they used milk instead. I'll still visit the restaurant because the food is tasty but not the dessert definitely

Very good, clean Thai food. Recommendations are the chicken yellow curry, fried rice and the minced chicken basil. Home delivery avail as well (via 3rd party delivery service)

Went to the Junction 8 outlet for lunch yesterday. Loved the convenience of ordering via emenus on the table. The food was great and fast. 5 stars in my books for quick n efficient service!
5
Been to both outlets. Nice food and environment both at the airport outlet and siglap. Friendly staff.
5
I ways prefer to visit this restaurant whenever I go to Changai airport.
I like their variety off Thai food and the staff hospitality.

Arriving bk in Singapore and enjoying a beautiful Thai dinner was absolutely delightful. I love Thai food and I love this place.

As regular patrons of Thai Express@ Terminal 3 Airport just above Departure Lounge, we have been enjoying great Thai iconic cuisines like fried soft-shell crabs, tom-yam seafood fried rice and its coconut milk desserts all these whiles.But our pre-departure late lunch today at T2 Central Thai on L3 today turns out to be a perfect disappointment.Not only its simple sub-standard 'Thai' dishes like veggie fried rice, tom-yam seafood soup and fried eggs are total cheats but the price is exorbitant. Service is incredibly poor, hostile and crude even when there are few diners around. The cashier does not even have the basic courtesy to apologise for adding to the bill of item(s) we have not ordered upon refund when caught red-handed

Went central Thai restaurant for 5dinner. Were immediately directed a corner table for 2. Ordered rice noodles, kailan vegetables, otah fish cakes, spices rolls and dessert (red rudy & tapioca with coconut milk). Overall the quality of dishes are below standard with that type of pricing. The tapioca is okay
2
Waited 20 minutes after being seated before I grabbed someone to take my order.Pricing on the walls outside is for a small portion but they don't tell you that. It's also out of date compared to the menu, eg $5.50 advertised for a coconut vs $6 on the menu.Tacked on some extra fees, too: 10% tip (not after that service!), 7% GST not shown as separate, $0.30 "towel" (??).The food was decent, but I was expecting to spend ~$16 and was charged $27.Would not recommend
5
they serve in small, medium, large portion. definitely for couples to family to group of friends dining! rest assured they serve hot tomyam soup and irresistible thai pineapple fried rice (even ladies have to put dieting aside for the time being). because I love spicy food, so I cannot define whether is it suitable for people who can only take mild spicy. Their food spiciness is fine for me
5
Halal, delicious, and very authentic Thai dishes that are mouthwatering and nosewatering too (spicy!) in the Terminal 2 mezzanine level just above the check-in counters. Excellent place. The glass noodles with prawn, seafood tom yam, and mango sticky rice were the best. Couldn't get enough but time was short. Maybe next time

... i must admit nice food, polite and attentive staff. easy ordering process. i like the form filling where you tick the food you want. i had to pay for the hand wipes, i thought there was no truth to "you pay everything in singapore"
4
Service was quick and polite. You have to complete a form with your order. This is then collected and in due course food arrived. Pad Thai was tasty. Spring rolls were fresh and hot. Good meal.
5
Its like you are in Bangkok if you will dine here. Authentic thai cuisine from central thailand. I like here. You will never regret. The service are very classic and really really authentic.

Casual thai dining. Quite authentic thai dishes. Tasty. Good balance between sweet and sour. Condiments like fresh chilli chilli powder separated to allow customers to choose their spiciness. Reasonable restaurant prices. Fast service. I think they give considerations to customers who have flights to catch.

We often visit this restaurant when we return to Singapore in the evenings or nights from overseas trip. My wife loves thai food and this place has a variety of options in soups, red and green curries as well as rice and noodle recipes. One good practice is they offer you a fragrant wet tissue, although chargeable for 50 cents. The overall service is also pretty swift and they always cater to my small custom requirements when it comes to red curry
5
A very comfortable place to go especially after arriving from a long haul tiring flight.The staff are very nice and easy going. They understands your need and they are pro-active enough to offer any assistance or help especially for tourist/foreigners.They have variety of dishes from spicy to comfort food. The food is halal and delicious.

My search for a completely vegetarian friendly Thai restaurant ended today after dining here.Absolutely thrilled that this is probably the first restaurant in Singapore (across cuisines) with a separate detailed Vegerarian Menu. They also take further refinements including no garlic,mushroom,tofu etc.There are a few restaurants with a vegetarian section in their menu but nothing quite like this. I think it is an astute business strategy in T2 where thousands of outbound vegetarian travellers flock. Another strategy that will work for them is their serving time is relatively lower for a fine dining. Plus their menu is really well stocked.Let me say here that my ratings are biased more in terms of location and concept and a little less in terms of food.Yes,i believe there is definite scope for them to improve the authenticity and taste of their food. Incidentally the quality of food in terms of ingredients and freshness is good. But i tend to agree with some reviewers that their chefs are not authentic.The tom yam soup is nice but could have more character. I ordered and olive rice which they later cancelled saying it was out of stock (found that strange as this is a running item in most thai restaurants). The pineapple fried rice was nice. The mango salad (another dipstick of performance) was average. The mango was sour and hence overpowered the dish. Fried Asparagus was really nice. Having said that,i would still recommend visiting this restaurant,particularly for vegetarians. I can see myself visiting this restaurant only for eating out even with no flights to catch

The restaurant looked enticing from the outside and the menu looked good. The green curry was good but the pomelo salad was a bit too salty for our taste. The food was just average and the portions disappointing. Most of the desserts we wanted were not available that day.
1
place was relatively packed with family dining together when i arrived. i was starving & needed a casual late dinner. simple pencil & paper method of ordering. had their recommended glass noodles with prawns. since it's recommended in the menu, & i'm starving, i thought anything could taste great! but to my disappointment, it was tasteless! saw a chef walked past, & he looks like a malay instead of thai! i guess thats why the food wasn't authentic thai food. maybe due to the timing (i was there at 9:15pm), the staff were busy at cleaning up, sweeping, mopping instead of serving water. this point aside, staff were fast & friendly when u need them. also had a tapioca dessert, which was decent. i would have chosen to eat at a hawker centre or coffee shop than to pay $18 for these 2 items. don't be deceived by the nice photos.

I always use Tom Yum as a yardstick to measure the authenticity of a Thai restaurant and I was not impressed. The Tom Yum seafood flavor was not strong and I wonder if it was prepared such to cater to a larger crowd. I have strong taste buds coming from a country like Malaysia so this was not really the taste I was looking for. The Boneless Chicken wrapped in Pandan Leaf, Pineapple Fried Rice and Stir-Fried Baby Kailan with Oyster Sauce were acceptable but probably not the best I have eaten.
