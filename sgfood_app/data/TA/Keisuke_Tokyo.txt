Probably the best ramen i've tried in Singapore. The long queue was worth it. The broth makes the ramen...very tasty. Worth your money!

They have free flow of eggs and bean sprouts which make the price worth. Request the level of the soup taste and also the tenderness of the ramen of your liking!

Good service, very accommodating for 2 young children (3.5 and 1.5). Clean high chair.
Yummy broth, really enjoyed it! Thanks!

Tried crab and fish base ramen today. Really something different. The crab stock seems too thick and guess still prefer the pork stock. Service standard was bad. Unlike the Japanese proud of what they serve.

As a fan of the Keisuke Chain in Singapore, my boyfriend and I decided to try Keisuke Tokyo at Suntec City for dinner. Upon arrival, we were impressed with the layout of the eatery, which is much more spacious than the other outlets we've been too. Hence, this outlet would be great for families with young children, or for large groups. We ordered the Crab Broth Ramen, as well as the Spicy Miso Tonkotsu Ramen respectively. The Crab broth ramen was too salty, and despite selecting 'Normal' as my preference for the thickness of the soup, it seemed more like a 'Rich' base. Hence I could not finish the bowl of noodles, as it was far too salty. Would highly recommend visiting Keisuke Kani King at Orchard Cineleisure instead, for a bowl of delicious crab broth ramen. The Spicy Miso ramen was better, however still lacklustre in comparison to other outlets we've been to. The outlet seemed slightly short-staffed, hence do expect longer waiting times during peak hours. Would not dine here again, but I would still recommend patronising other Keisuke outlets

Highly recommend crab ramen if you like rick seafood stock. The soup is creamy and tasty. Noodles is thick and pretty filling, but awesome overall. Tonkotsu soup is very flavorful with porky taste. Free eggs and bean sprouts definitely scores points for this place. Kids get to eat free too!Service staff are very friendly and well informed on food ingredients. Location wise, it is conveniently located in Suntec City on the convention centre side on level 2. If travelling by train, alight at Esplanade station and take Suntec exit

Its a good ramen place. Not the best, but definitely good. For first timers i would not recommend takin a strong soup base for the crab broth ramenMy friend who had it the first time felt that it was too salty. He claimed that he had a glimpse of the sea and felt as though he was kayaking and the kayak capsized, then he was drowning in the ocean and drinking loads of sea water and there happened to be some ramen floatin in the ocean which he eats. To summarise, the strong soup base was too salty for him tat he felt that his kidneys were screaming in pain I would not reccomend the other side dishes though as they taste pretty normal. The gyoza is slightly better than average but other than that... The others are not really worth the mone

This is currently the Suntec branch as the previous branch in Millenia Walk has shifted over. Really like how the crab broth tastes like since it was in Millenia a while back and was quite sad that it closed down a few years back. It has since reopened in Suntec which is more accessible but do go early to avoid the dinner and lunch crowds! Ramen is reasonably priced and you get to choose how you like your final ramen to be. A must try for ramen lovers

Simply love their signature CRAB soup base for the ramen. Available in light, normal or heavy (if you have strong tastebug) for your choosing. The bean sprouts (marinated) is free flow together with the hard boiled eggs. Best of all, kids below 10 gets a free bowl of ramen :) Simply a great place to bring your children there :

Keisuke is a Japanese Rahmen shop. They have a very nice menu with lots of options on how you like your Rahmen to be prepared. The chefs are really up to it and the place gets very busy at lunch and after work hours. The staff is very fast at peak times but during the slow hours it can take a while till you get noticed and served. I do recommend Keisuke for the avid Rahmen lover not so much for anyone else.
