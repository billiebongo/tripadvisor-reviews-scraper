Made the trek out to this place for lunch earlier in the week and was quite pleased with the result. Lunch sets are great value at $18 all in. Sake is also pretty good value. Note that it's cash only.

The sashimi are given all generously, service is equally excellent as well. The wagyu there melts in the mouth. Seafood are so fresh as well! Super stoked to return back to this place again:)

Very impressive quality of sushi served and shocking memory for us as the staff has superb memories of us when we were at the same place 6 years ago. Definitely will go back very often....again n repeat!

I was skeptical given the location, but this is a very nice little sushi bar! Prices are reasonable and all the food was very good. Plentiful set meals are about $15-22 and hot sake was $8. Chefs are very friendly. I'll definitely return!

Japanese food lovers will not regret trying this place. They are very generous with their portion, and for the price u pay, u probably fet miserable amounts somewhere else!

I've been a loyal customer for 2 years. A bit on the pricy side. Wagyu beef is highly recommended. All food item is nice. Go for the salmon sashimi, it's a must order.

We chanced upon this place and it was a pleasant surprise for us; a hidden gem at level 5 of Far East Plaza. There are 2 Wasabi Tei restaurants near each other, merely separated by another small eatery. They are the same brand. The one at the corner unit is newly renovated, with modern Japanese resturant look and feel. The one slightly further in looks like a traditional Japanese resturant, with a vintage feel. Both are with limited seating capacity. The first can probably seat 24 while the later about 12. All seats are around the sushi counter. Cosy with e couple of friends but may not be suitable for large gatherings. The newly renovated resturant was full house, so we proceeded to the vintage one. Turned out we love the whole vintage feel and it was an great experience for us. We ordered the set for at $50. It consist of:1. A sashimi platter with 2 types of sashimi (salmon, tuna, yellowtail and can't remember what we the last but maybe you can recognise by the photo attached) - each slide is about 8mm thick, fresh and juicy.2. Two side dishes; jellyfish and some shellfish salad - jellyfish was well-seasoned and flavourful, crunch and rather tasty. I find it a little salty to eat without rice though. The shellfish salad was quite addictive. You can taste the sweetness of the shellfish. Very delicious. 3. A bowl of mini hot soba noodle soup each. It was just the right amount of carbo to go with the meal. 4. 6-pieces eel sushi. I'm not a fan of eel, so was okay for me. The flavour was alright. 5. A cup of chawamushi each. The portion was quite generous. It contained mushroom, prawn and crab stick. The egg could be smoother but overall flavour was good.6. Ends with a slice of watermelon and an exquisite red bean mochi in the shape of mini oranges. Yum!7. You pay $2 cover charge for either tea or soft drinks. But you save 17% from your total bill because there is no 10% service charge and 7% GST! You only pay the nett price for the good food! For the food portion, quality of food, price and to mention the classic vintage feel, it is definitely value for money and highly recommended. We will certainly return to try other dishes. Oh lastly, there are limited seats and the queue was long when we left. You should go early during peak hours.

We always go to the Wasabi Tei Japanese restaurant when in Singapore (the smaller, original one). As usual the food, particularly the salmon sashimi was absolutely delicious (we ended up getting one serve each we love it so much!). My husband then had a beef set and I had the grilled chicken which were also great. The original chef with the colourful hair was not there and we did miss him because he certainly added to the charm of the place

Glad I found this place. At first glance it seems like a little hole in the wall in a crowded mall. Looks aside, this place has good quality sushi with generous portions at a reasonable price. When I went I was the only one there, and the sushi chef was very friendly and attentive. I'll be back..

Situated on the 5th floor of Far East Plaza, this tiny shop with a seating of 20 can be found immediately upon exiting the lift.I usually order salmon sashimi because it's worth paying for. For $12, they give you thick pieces of 6 and each slice takes me about 2-3 bites. The cold noodles (zaru soba) was great but a little pricy considering that it's $8 for a small portion.Squid stuffed with roe and topped off with flying fish roe is something for roe lovers but sometimes it is served not totally defrosted so let it sit for while if you don't like chewing on icy squid.If you're on a budget, order the set meals which are $12< but be sure to bring sufficient cash as this place does not accept nets or credit cards. Bright side, no gst and service charge

Reasonable priced lunch set which served with miso soup, hot green tea, salad and cut fruits. Only cash payment is accepted here. The dine in area was very small with only counter seats available.
5
Very satisfying lunch $24 for Mekajiki chirashi sushi set. Generous servings of swordfish (16 pieces I counted !) in a bowl of rice. Great value ! A light appetizer of simmered salmon with daikon and Sliced Fruit for dessert was also included in the price.

I am a regular at Wasabi Tei and I am very rarely a regular anywhere because there are just so many eateries all over Singapore. The food there is lovingly tended to by loyal staff even sometimes the boss himself. Portions are exceedingly generous here and the prices are extremely reasonable given that Japanese food tends to be very expensive with small portions. Customers especially like huge, chilled fresh slices of sashimi served. They have really nice sushi too, freshly prepared. I especially like the one with unagi and salmon sashimi and mango sauce where they char it with a torch just before serving. Utterly delicious and enough to send you to food heaven. Every so often, when I have the craving for Japanese food, I will make time for Wasibi Tei. Too many other Japanese places have let me down before so I have definitely learnt to make sure I go to Wasabi Tei when I have a Japanese craving! haha!

my insurance agent brought me here. the atmosphere is quiet. the setting is a U-shape table top where the chef work at the center area. the salmon sashimi is really fresh and the size is huge. probably the biggest i've ever tried. i also had the cawanmushi, and beef rice. they are up to the standard.I definitely will bring some more friends here to try
5
I had a sashimi mix of salmon, tuna and swordfish. Fresh and thick cut of abt 1cm was served. Try also the clam salad. Great flavour packed with clams. Chawanmushi was rather smooth too. It wasn't too crowded today but it's amazing how the chef cope single handedly on a Saturday dinner shift

Am always here with my other half and friends, always leave with a happy and warm tummy. There's a reason they've been around forever, the freshness of their salmon sashimi is unbeatable with their affordable and reasonable prices. There's a seating charge of $2 per pax inclusive of a drink, and each person must order a main/item. And there's only counter seats with a seating capacity of not more than 10-12. They strictly do not take any reservations, and seat you only if all your parties are present, but no one complains. I will always order their sushi and udon set/ chirashi set (loooove them) that comes with a miso soup. Their salmon chirashi (premium) set comes with a salmon miso soup, chawanmushi (steamed egg with prawn and some straw mushroom made on the spot you order), seafood salad (appetizer that contains octopus and some other seafood) & a matcha ice cream as dessert (you can choose to have sweet red bean paste added with no extra charge). Their prices are nett and it's a unwritten rule for us regulars that you can only order once (when you are seated), if you do want to order anything else halfway through or at the end of your meal, most probably everyone will look up and look at you. This is to facilitate the customer traffic so waiting time for next customers are cut down to a minimum. They close on Sundays and for lunch. Dinner opens at 5(5.30pm?) and last order is 8.30pm. If you want to get their dons (rice) or sushi, be there latest by 7.30pm as the rice will be finished for the night. Don't mind the present head chef's poker face and do not take it as he is unhappy (he's pretty much expressionless even when he is cracking a joke) and no one there is Japanese but this is one place you can get really good Japanese food at a really great price: from $10 for a oyaku (egg and beef omelette rice bowl) set + miso soup, + $2 seat charge that includes a drink (only the hot green tea is refillable), to $28 for a salmon chirashi set (+$2 seat charge of course). I think there's another set at $30 but can't remember what it is. If you're feeling more frivolous, you can order the other sashimi, they have a decent selection like scallop to octopus; & sides like shishamo. Take the lift at ground floor outside the front of building (the tiny glass lift) go up to the 5th floor and TURN LEFT. The one I'm talking about is 2 shops down after you turn left at the lift, with Japanese door curtain hanging down at the doorway with black doorframes and frosted glass (acrylic?) walls along the outside. This is the original and best one. There's another wasabi tei right in front of the 5th floor lift with white exterior & clear glass walls but I don't like the standard of the food. They're owned by the same owner but what makes the 2 outlets different is the chefs and the ways they prepare their menu. Can't wait to come back here again

Read the initial review from TripAdvisor. Went with my family to check out the food. We tried calling to book but no one pick up the call. You need to have the whole group there before you are given seats. Pls note that it is cash only. The person running the counter is not exactly the friendliest person you ever met. However the sashimi cut is the biggest I have ever seen. Just one portion is good enough for a meal. The food is fresh and the atmosphere is cramp. This is a place where you eat and go. You can't really relax like in many other expensive Japanese restaurant. Good value for money. Remember.. No advance booking and cash payment only.

Standing in a fairly run down shopping centre that Specialises in tailored suits and feeling hungry led us to consult trip advisor's 'near me now'. We found Wasabi was just around the corner and everything the reviews said it would be. Authentic, extremely clean and freshly prepared to order. I had salmon sashimi which was wonderful and a huge portion and my partner had a set lunch which we shared as it was also on the generous side. We highly recommend Wasabi but remember it is cafe style and very unpretentious

Difficult to find, hidden in the back of the 5th floor of the run-down Far East Plaza (when compared to other very modern malls in Orchard). No tables, you sit in a stool in a U-shaped counter surrounding the chef. Place can get a bit cramped and the chef patiently prepares one dish at a time (from everyone in the counter). It all adds up to the experience and you end up feeling that a Japanese restaurant can't get more authentic than that.The food is just superb and the fish is fresh and very tasty. A must try in my opinion, also good value for money, me and my wife spent SGD68 for both and we left completely fulfilled. Just sit, take your time and patiently wait as the chef prepares each dish in front of you at his own time
5
Slices of sashimi are generous and fresh. The chefs are very hygienic in the food preparation and they have extensive experience. For SGD25 per person, one can have a value-for-money lunch. It is all-counter high-chair seats and fuss-free service. Refillable green tea at SGD2 is worth the money and tastes authentic
4
The biggest sake sashimi ever eaten. Excellent quality of fish, sake and cod with teriaky sauce are very good.
You have to wait, but it is been well worthwhile!!
5
Great sushi for reasonable prices, this place does it right. I've eaten here for lunch a few times and each has been amazingly good. The hamachi kama is the best I've had. It's a hole in the wall type of place but totally worth it. They have two locations near each other, I suspect because it has gotten so popular. Almost hate to post this review and give it away

Visited here the 2nd time. The service this time was alot better than the first. Although still not that pleasing for a restaurant. Even though the service wasn't that fantastic, the salmon sashimi is definitely a must try plate when visited. It cost $12 for 6 thick slices about 1cm thick. The quality of the salmon was really good and fresh. You can see layer of fats of the salmon and that is the best part. You can also try the salmon teriyaki set, the salmon served is thick and nicely grilled and very fresh. Definitely a salmon place to die for. The only think is that the place is really small. So do expect long waiting time during peak hours. And its located at level 4 at the back of a stretch of eateries. Signage is small, just look up for it.

We discovered Wasabi Tei when we were in Singapore a few times ago and were so impressed with the quality of the food and the price that we ensure we now go a number of times whilst in Singapore.We discovered this time that there is a new & bigger Wasabi Tei just around the corner from the original restaurant, but for nostalgic reasons we continue to frequent our old favourite.The food is amazing and very cheap. Our favourite is the salmon sashimi - five thick slices that melt in your mouth for I think about S$12 or S$15. My husband and I used to share a serve as an entree but we couldn't decide who got the extra piece, so now get one each!The place is not salubrious i.e. stools at a counter and you may have to queue at busy times. The chef is a character with his blue tinted hair :o

Hard to find little restaurant on the top floor of East Asia Mall. But don't give up until you find it. With only 16 seats and a meticulous sushi chef your the plates are carefully prepared one by one. The fish is of very good quality and the slices for both sushi and sashimi are very generous. All in all a very nice sushi meal for a reasonable price.

This place was a little hard to find, as with many eateries in Far East Plaza (between Goodwood Park Hotel and Grand Hyatt Hotel, not the one beside Hilton hotel). Be there early and you'd be rewarded with ample space and privacy. I once went there many years before, and there was a considerable queue. It is a nice, cozy place with a U-shaped table, enough for say 12-15 people to sit together? I remembered sharing a huge plate of generously sliced salmon, swordtail, tuna and scallop and it was finger-licking good! This time round, I went with my wife and ordered a bento set with some salmon sashimi to share. The bento was alright, but very reasonably priced. The green tea was very aromatic and had a very savory after taste. My wife said that she preferred the normal kind of hot green tea, but I quite liked the green tea with a tinge of sesame. The highlight of the whole meal was the thickly sliced salmon sashimi! It's not pricy, $12 nett for 6 huge slices! The wasabi was also not too hot, just nice to have that nice surge of vapour through the nasal passage. Would highly recommend a return visit just for the sashimi

I went to Wasabi Tei with a friend when I was visiting Singapore in May. I really enjoyed it there having beer with the wide range of grilled skewers. The is a huge variety of different skewers you can order, all of which were very tasty. Sashimi was also very good.It's quite tight in the little restaurant but that is part of the atmosphere in itself
4
Had dinner here twice to enjoy supersmooth & tender sashimi.The place is kind of strange with 16 chairs around an U-Shaped bar with the chef running in the middle. Don't expect super friendly service here and everything takes it's time.This is all compensated with by the very nice food they serve, sashimi is great, sushi is very good, and other things I tasted were also good.I had hard time finding the place, as it is located quite hidden in the back on the 5th floor of the far east plaza. I have had several times Japanese in Singapore, but by far the one I had was this one. To go for similar quality elsewhere you will pay a steep higher price

We saw this restaurant in Lonely Planet before we went to Singapore last time and were determined to try it. It took a bit of time to find it on the 5th floor or the Lucky Plaza shopping mall, but it was worth it! We were back in Singapore again for 10 days and ended up going twice for lunch and dinner (it's closed on Sundays).The food is nothing less than superb & the best sashimi I have ever tasted anywhere regardless of standard of restaurant. It is also incredibly cheap eg S$10 for 6 pieces of sake (salmon) sashimi that literally melt in one's mouth.It's a pokey little place that only seats about 20 people but we didn't have to wait for a seat (although the queue was building up on Saturday night). The service is fast and efficient.The chef is an interesting character who only adds to the character of the place. I reckon if he was Japanese (I believe he's Chinese), he would be working in a top class Japanese restaurant charging a lot more than this restaurant does

This place has been around for quite some time. Used to be own by a moody chef, as only 2 person managed the 16 seater bar counter setup. He retired 3 years ago, and now is prepared by 3 local staff.Things have changed for the better, now you can do some small chit-chat and service is better, unlike the past, where u may have to rush. Good thing about this place, is that their sashimi servings are huge and generous and very worth it. $10 for 6 thick fresh slices. Do the maths. hot meals are prepared in the small kitchen behind, whereas the rest are sliced and prepared at the counter.Queue is still long, so do be prepared to wait. As some customers do take their own sweet time to eat and chat. It's no wonder in the past, the chef would be angry as you are depriving another person's place. So do not go with the mindset of chatting and eating. They are doing a decent business too. I feel you are paying for quality and delicious food at very reasonable prices, so do try this place, as it is not like those big joints selling japanese food that taste so average at mark up prices
