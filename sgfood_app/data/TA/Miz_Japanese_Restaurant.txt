Very reasonably priced Japanese food! Nice selection with generous servings and good quality. We really enjoyed the sushi rolls esp soft shell crab and una-kyu. Loved the fried oysters and the thick slices of sashimi.
Friendly efficient service.

Small Japanese restaurant with very authentic Japanese food. Very reasonable price. Boss is friendly & attentive. Good location, a very short distant from Tanjong Pagar. Japanese & local come by even alone for meals. Must try!

Walking distance from Outram MRT, affordable lunch menu. It's crowded at lunch so it might be hard to get a seat. Food taste good :)

My wife and I went using a groupon offer, but the serving was minimal as they charged the more expensive prices and then the groupon value is used up very quickly.

It is a very small restaurant handled by 2 serving staff and they managed it well. I ordered the sashimi with rice and it was good value with very fresh fish. Also ordered tempura prawns, the batter was light and prawns fresh and big. A very good place to have authentic Japanese food if you do not care much about the ambience. Tables are very close to each other so if you want to talk about anything private this is not the place

A lunch treat from my niece. Found the place very interesting, small stairway to 2nd floor of the restaurant. Place is small and accommodate about 20 tables. Food served was good and price is very reasonable. Peak hour is best to call to reserve as that is when it gets very crowded

This must be the cheapest Japanese restaurant in Singapore. Look at the size of the food. Imagine 5 rolls of shashimi salmon belly for $12. The beef sukiyaki for $13.80 can feed 2 persons. Gintara Bento 200gm of fresh cod grilled to perfection with miso soup rice pickles salad and japanese egg roll.

I chanced upon this place while eating with some colleagues one day. Since then, I've brought my wife and on another occasion my kids here. We all agree this is a great place for authentic Japanese food - the type we missed from visiting Japan. This is not your posh Jap restaurant. Rather, it is your feel-at-home type of place with great food at great prices. The restaurant (which is on the 2nd floor) is not big, it has 3 long tables for bigger groups and about 6 tables for smaller groups. Water is self service and they usually only have 1 to 2 staff. I love the Chirashi Don and the scallop dynamite. My kids love the shishamo. My wife loves the place as it brings use back to our travels in Japan. I look forward to coming back again

We live in the area and go for Japanese a couple of times a week. We found Miz by chance really, as we had been going to another Japanese down the road (Densou) which sadly closed down. Chotto Matte was also round the corner and was nice, but overpriced. It's also now closed down. So we found miz - and have loved it every time we've been (or in fact ordered food for takeaway).If you're looking for 'posh Japanese', this probably isn't the place for you. It's not a fancy restaurant. But it's just what we were looking for - a local Japanese restaurant, reasonably priced, not fancy decor but still v welcoming, great food and v friendly service.The portions of sashimi are good, with thick cuts of fish. The friendly lady serving us always tells us what's fresh in - including the uni, as we love that. We also like the tempura (mushrooms v good), shishamo, cold soba, gyoza, age dashi tofu, edamame, handrolls. All v good...Probably could do with a bit more decor and/or music to 'lift' the atmosphere, but we don't really mind that. We love it

Fresh sashimi and sushi, great tasting seasoning.
Read several negative reviews on hungrygowhere and really wasn't expecting that much but I had purchased groupon voucher so still decided to give it a shot. :) it exceeded my expectations as a result.

There's a wide variety of Japanese food and drinks available, however i would not call it authentic Japanese food. We tried the maguro sashimi, seafood porridge and chef's recommended grill eel without sauce. The maguro wasn't very fresh and cut properly, the porridge uses Long grain rice instead of Japanese rice and the eel was something different which was the only dish that I felt was special. I feel they are trying to do too many types of Japanese cuisines and does not excel in any. I prefer restaurants that specialises on a few really good items

There is a coupon promotion. It was a BIG mistake purchasing S$250 worth of coupons. They are really short handed. I have to ask for my tea and they did not refill after the first cup. The sale of coupon promotion was a huge success and I expected fresh sashimi to be served. Perhaps it's second grade stuff that were served on my two different visits. I would not go for good Jap food

My friends and I visited this restaurant on a Thursday evening. Situated quietly at one corner along the more well-known Tanjong Pagar Road, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. It looked quiet on the outside, but in fact it was almost full house. 90s J-pop music was played and overall it did not feel cramp. There were only 2 people serving the customers so it took us quite some time to have our orders taken.Since it was our first visit, we ordered something simple, a set course for 3pax ($38++). This includes a salad of our choice (we chose potato salad), sashimi (4 pcs each of salmon and swordfish, based on the chef's decision), deep fried dried cuttlefish, choice of udon/soba hot/cold (we chose hot udon), salt grilled Saba and dessert of the day. We hesitated about chawanmushi as it cost $8, which was pricier than most restaurants. Anyway we decided to give it a try.The waitress served us our hot tea and complimentary edamame. This was definitely the best part since I'm edamame lover. Sashimi was fresh, fatty enough and nicely cut. The potato salad that came with a scoop of mash potato and some raw vegetables was good, especially its sauce. Deep fried dried cuttlefish tasted sweet and crispy, like a good snack to go with beer. Chawanmushi was served in the size of a rice bowl, pretty delicious and the chicken was well-marinated. However its texture was not very smooth.We shared the above dishes and had individual portions of the rest. The homely hot udon soup was served in clear soup, topped with spring onion and bonito flakes, and the small piece of Saba was perfectly grilled. Dessert of that day was Matcha ice cream.At less than $18 each, the portion was just right for us 3 ladies, although I will prefer to have a bigger portion of the deep fried dried cuttlefish

I've eaten at Miz quite a number of times - one dinner and many lunches.Lunch at Miz is value-for-money with their set lunches. They have quite a variety for you to choose on their lunch menu. Of course, you're also free to order from their ala-carte menu.For my visit today with my colleagues, we found out about a new set menu! Rather delighted to know that the set menu is not just for dinner, but lunch as well. I also finally managed to try the chawanmushi! Everytime i asked for it in my previous visits, it wouldn't be available.As usual, the sashimi was fresh. I guess that's why it keeps bringing my colleagues and me back

I went to Miz few times as it is located in my neighborhood area. I put the title as 'on and off' because you must know what to order. The salmon soup and the grilled fish are at good standard. However, do not try to order sashimi as it is pricey and not worth it. There are some bento set available but I never order those

My family and I went to this restaurant a few days ago. When we made reservation the week before, the lady owner took the call and she was very helpful. As soon as we reached there, we were greeted by the owner and staffs and we were also offered green tea which was on the house. Raw squid with salted soya bean that cost $8 came in a small bowl. It was quite unique and tasted good. The lady owner showed us how to beat or stir it with chopsticks before eating. The slices of salmon sashimi was thick enough and was fresh too. Assorted tempura which included 3 prawn and mixed vege was quite light and nice. The two big grilled mushroom on the plate cost us $15 and it was O K but I would prefer it if it was not that creamy. Chicken teriyaki was juicy and tasty. Grill shishamo was simply good and only $5 for 3 pieces. Chawanmushi came in a big bowl compared to other restaurants . We were very happy with grill Saba fish that had fresh taste and had no strong fish smell. Eel with sweet sauce was tasty but eel prepared plain was lack of fresh taste. Deep fried soft shell crab was fine but somehow I found it quite oily. We needed to spend $15 to $ 18 per dish and the portion was nether big nor small. With 10% service charge and no GST, our bill for 5 pax was $220, so I guess we will not frequent the place unless we have groupon voucher. One of the staffs was not so knowledgable about the food they serve and was not so efficient but we didn't let that effect our dining and we just enjoyed our dinner there

Place is super stuffy. Sweating n waiting for food for more than 1 hour when the place is quite empty. Super expensive food. Probably the most expensive japanese food in Singapore. Even with groupon , it is not worth coming. Avoid at all cost!! On the plus side, the service was not bad. Waitresses are friendly and seem to enjoy their job.

My friends and I went to the restaurant for lunch, with Groupon vouchers.We were greeted by an unmotivated waitress who directed us to our table and then disappeared, leaving us to look for the menu ourselves.When serving the food, the waitress just put all the food in front of one of my friends and then walked away, expecting my friend to distribute the food to us. It is all right if the waitress did not want to serve the food to us individually, but she should have at least place the food in the middle of the table. It was difficult to get the attention of the waitresses. Even after we had caught their attention and told them what we needed, our requests were quickly forgotten.The only person in the restaurant who seemed to be interested in doing business was the Japanese manager. The poor lady had to serve customers, clear tables, re-arrange the seats, man the counter... though she was having a hard time multi-tasking, she always greeted her customers with a smile.As for the food, the seafood miso soup was tasty, the eel in the eel rice was fresh, the vegetable tempura was crispy but not oily and the salmon tea rice was pleasant. The tiny soft-shelled crab, which came with a huge price tag, was a disappointment. Its taste was not fantastic, neither was the way that it was presented. I think if the management is serious about bringing a good dining experience to their customers, they have to work very hard to re-train their staff

This is a regular among my coworkers in Singapore and while they have often noted the service can be slow, yesterday it was just neglectful. Four of us went for lunch; two ordered katsu don and two chirashi. While the katsu don came after fifteen minutes, the chirashi didn't arrive until 40 minutes AFTER that! We flagged down several waitresses, who didn't seem to understand or care - it took me searching through the back room for the manager to get someone to notice. They knocked the service charge off the menu but come on guys, this is pretty poor
