I booked a table for Jan 10th, only to get there and see a sign saying that their last day of operations was on Jan 8th. Good thing Orchard Central has plenty of other lunch options! Didn't get to try their set lunches after all.

We were looking for a quiet place for business dinner. Wanted european food, and decided to give this a try. Large variety of tapas. The sangria is good. client was impressed by the food and the presentation.

We had booked a table through Quandoo but there was no acknowledgment from the restaurant and we were treated as " walk-in" customers. The tapas were below average. Quality of service can be better if tried. Not worth it.

Yogurt chicken wings was so so only. Seafood Paella and beef stew were good. There was free flow of many types of bread, which we enjoyed.

Me and my friends were pleasantly surprised of this restaurant. Our paella, calamares and meatballs were equally delicious! There's also a 25% discount if you will be dining from 230pm to 6pm.

the food was good but sad that we didn't get to have their seafood lobster platter on Xmas day cause they "ran out of lobster" when they just opened. Service was very poor. Waiters constantly chatting away far away ignoring customers presence. The waitress also served a sharing dish without side plates, and she was like unhappy & yawning away when we called her back to request for them.

Went there for dinner last week with a friend and truly enjoyed it. We had the yummy meatballs and the mushrooms were tasty. However, we both felt that the foie gras was a little overcooked & the beans with it was not so appetising. Were glad we didnt order any mains as the staters were quite generous coupled with the free bread. There is a promotion before 7pm on weekdays which are quite worth it. Will come again to check the rest of the dishes

Had the Aviation cocktail, during happy hour, which was just nice with a alcoholic kick. The tapas were good with the soft shell crab in crispy batter and meaty flesh, and clams in flavorful broth. Service was lacklustre, with staffs gathering in a corner talking without paying attention to diners

This a lovely place to try, good range and choice of food, tapas comes out quickly and is nicely priced.Had around 8 dishes to share, with a glass of wine and coke, came to $150 SGD in total.Tables can be a little close if you want some privacy, but the atmosphere is great. Would definitely ask to sit by the window for more space ;)The staff are great as well, visited a few times and they are always attentive, with good recommendations

We came here with rather high expectations but was left unimpressed. I have to qualify that we came for lunch and tried a couple of Tapas dishes and had the set lunch. What's good is the price of set lunch. The pork chop set was only $8.50, which is about how much you'd pay in a food court. However, it tasted like food court fare. I would have gladly paid double for an Iberico pork chop, but that cut was unavailable. Of all the set lunch, I'd recommend the lobster linguine - $14.50 - for a half small sized lobster with linguine. Good value for money. The Yoghurt chicken wings could do with a bit more taste while the meat balls were a bit over fried but rescued by the zesty tomato sauce. Service was good for local standard, although the part time waitress was clueless and had to refer to the head waiter for most questions

I had good spanish suckling pig in vivocity and was expecting the standards to be about the same - since both boast imported suckling pigs from spain. the one i had here was cold, hard and chewable. expensive and disappointing

Good food, ambience and service. What more can u ask for!
Mains took a while before being served but the free bread starters was a nice touch to fill the gap.

My husband and I came across this restaurant by luck.
The restaurant has a view looking onto Orchard Road.
They do a wonderful 2 or 3 course lunch 7 days a week. It was filling and reasonably priced. I would go back again.

In my hunt to get some veg food, I got into this restaurant and must admit that it was not cheap. The air conditioning requires serious upgrade.
Staff was good. Food taste was average. Sangria wasn't close to what a spanish one would taste like.

On the 8th floor of Orchid Central is this cute family-run Spanish Tapas place. Great views, very friendly staff and above all Authentic Affordable Tapas !The Ham, the Squid, the curries muzzles, olives, chicken, baked fish are all authentic which go down well with some Spanish beer.You can while away hours at this place

This place is tucked away in the labyrinth called Orchard Central which is a horribly awkward and foolishly designed building which requires great patience if you want to uncover its treasures. (Try taking the lifts and see if you don't agree with me). But for those who persist, Milagro is a great find if you want something different to regular Singapore fare. We had paella negro (generous seafood paella cooked in squid ink). And it was so worth it. Seasoning. Perfect. Seafood. Fresh. Paella rice. Cooked to perfection. We tried a couple of starters too. The fried cauliflower was delicious. Who knew cauliflower could be so decadent? The other starter was akin to ham and cheese croquette. No biggie. There was tapas on the menu but because we were having paella, we had to reign in our order. Deco? It's an odd mixture but seriously, who cares when the paella was that good. Service. Excellent. I arrived parched and 'starving' and the kind words and quick service were the exactly what we needed. If you get a table by the window. You can get a semi decent view of Orchard Road. Love to come back again to explore the tapas menu. Ciao for no

If you are tired with the local Singaporean dishes, Spanish food must be another choice for you. Try this restaurant, their menu is unique and different from other Spanish restaurant in Singapore. The Paella is my favorite and everyone goes in must try. There is a large range of wine and sangria for you to choose from with reasonable price.

Restaurant is quite minimalist, a nice place for friends to talk-eat.Squid-ink paella came out a bit too wet. Potatoes were fantastic with the special sauce. They also have a bread station, where you can cut your own bread. Sangria was not bad, but very small jug, which is slightly on the expensive side

I was there with a friend on a Tuesday afternoon in November. We didnt make a reservation but we were early and got a table next to the window. The servers were polite and attentive in their service. The bread was fresh. I totally enjoyed my order of tomato pasta with ham and my girlfriend was happy with her Eggs Royale. Seatings looks adequate. I would recommend this to any one who is looking for reasonable priced meals

Lovely surprise to find a Spanish place in Orchard Central. They serve a good variety of spanish tapas and also favourites such as jamon iberico, paella, etc. Service was so-so. The waiter was a bit clueless, when we first walked in and throughout our dinner. But good was good and it came fast. Good place to visit when looking for a quick bite. Decor is nothing fancy
