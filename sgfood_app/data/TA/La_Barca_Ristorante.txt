Had a pleasant little surprise for my son who was celebrating his 12th Birthday.
It was a Mommy & Me date and the staff took special care of us to make it memorable.
4
they need to dim the lights slightly. they were way too bright for a dinner setting. food was good. service was good.
5
We were interested to try La Barca as we heard that Michelin Star Chef Michele Sorrentino had left and Giuseppe was now at the helm. Food was still very delicious! Excellent service as always. Very enjoyable dinner experience.

Dined here on a Saturday night before watching a play at the black box. Informed them that we were there for a quick dinner and they recommended few dishes which won't take long to serve. Ordered bruschetta, margherita pizza, tiramisu, virgin mojito and a flat white. The bruschetta was good and the pizza was pretty decent. Everything tasted fresh. Tiramisu was excellent. Virgin mojito was refreshing. They took extra care to make sure that our food arrived promptly and we made it for the play on time.Overall, the food was above average and service was excellent.

La Barca has become the favourite for a lot expats with young families staying in the east. Every weekend, the water filled bouncy castle, trampoline play areas to keep the children on their toes while the adults sit around enjoying their drinks. Food is decent - definitely not the best Italian but one of the better places around the East. Service is slow during weekends and if you happen to catch their manager - Michele in a bad mood - you will know it ! On both of my visits to LB- He seemed rushed, loud and aggressive( when the place was buzzing and people waiting ) and at other times friendly ( when the rush died down and things became quieter) Not exactly the qualities of a good manager specially in the service industry.All in all - definitely avoid weekends if you’re more interested in enjoying the food and service

Ok might be a slight exaggeration but it’s definitely one of the most family friendly restaurants in Singapore. Fabulous water play slides, bouncy castle, lots of indoor and outdoor space. And nice food for the parents. Food the kids will eat. Beer, wine, coffee, handmade gelato, delicious food and desserts. It’s awesome. Staff are helpful and friendly to
5
This was my first time to La Barca and certainly it will not be the last . It’s a good place for a meal and have a decent conversation as there are no crowds , the food especially the A3 Beef Florentine is top notch 
2
The service is decent with poker faced unsmiling waiters who do their job but not much more. The food is really overrated. The Florentine steak is decent, but a tad dry. Portion wise it was generous. The pastas are really very very salty and tasted bad.
5
An Italian friend recommended this to me, to the surprise of a couple of people. He was spot on in saying this is one to try.While the menu is not vast, this was a great place to have a relaxed lunch. There were three large groups of people enjoying themselves, including a group of Italians celebrating Christmas. Always a good sign. And the classic dishes we chose were perfectly done. See pictures that are posted.It’s a bit of a trek (20 mins cab ride from the city centre) but worth it. You can also stroll around the sprawling art centre where the restaurant is located.Total lunch bill (for two): SGD130 (burrata starter, eggplant parmigiana, spaghetti carbonara, two glasses of wine and one tiramisu)
2
La Barca came well recommended, but it fell flat. My starter tartare didnt taste fresh, fillet for main was good. Blue Cheese sauce very watery and they forgot our chips until dessert. It was 9pm and kids were running about making noise. I felt we should of just opted for a place in the city for what was supposed to be a well organised evening dinner with a few friends. Won’t be back
5
Brought my family to La Barca Ristorante for dinner. We were greeted by very friendly staff. The food is good. We had the Fiorentina steak, Prosciutto Di Parma, Tartara Di Vitellina and mixed salad. For dessert, go for the chocolate lava cake and the "Dome".
5
La Barca has excellent Italian food and it is perfect for families with kids as they can play on the outdoor space or the toys room inside. It has excellent service and the gelato is a must try!
5
Fantastic food and even better service, highly recommended. The manager provides an immaculate personal touch enriching the overall experience.
5
Although we have been several times to this place I didn't expect to be that happy today. Everything we ordered was absolutely great, service is up to expectation. Can't wait to be back soon.
Pictures highlight our great lunch.
5
They serve excellent and authentic Italian fare. The Tuscan Steak is better than that we have tasted in Tuscany. The Previous Executive Chef was a Michelin-starred Chef. It is now helmed by Giuseppe.Food quality is always maintained and we are happy to recommend this place to all foodies
4
Our toddler loved playing here and even ate all of his lunch!They had toddler pools and a jumping castle and trampoline set up outside which were fun.The food was also tasty. We had the lamb and salmon and were happy with both. They claim their gelato is amazing. It was ok but to kids it's just yummy ice cream.Would definitely recommend to families with younger children.Seems to be a place very popular with ex pats so you feel like a local here.Easy to get to from the city by MRT
1
We went to La Barca and wanted to redeem the entertainer app offer, which consisted of 1 free main for each main ordered. We were told by the waiter that it was only valid after 6pm even though this was not mentioned anywhere in the offer. We were offered the lunch menu, which was a little cheaper than the dinner menu but way more expensive than the offer. Felt like it was a waste of time to go there. Please improve the communication of your offers
5
Love this place1) food is excellent. Delicious. Well made. 2) fantastic set up catering to kids. Indoor and outdoor play areas with lots to keep them occupied. Bouncy castles, trampolines3) still has an adult setting/ambience so you don't feel like u r in a playcentre4) good value for money.

Located in the artsy goodman arts centre La Barca has a lovely location , alfresco dining , kid friendly ...located close to residential area's . Unfortunately the food does not do justice , though not too expensive it leave a lot desired . I am a vegetarian, and to be fair to them, they did have a few options .We ordered a burrata pizza thinking there would be burrata topping on the regular pizza , what we got was a pizza base with tomato concasse and a few chunks of melted burrata. The gnocchi which is normally a simple, fool proof dish was also different , some flavor that did not go well with us.The sides of roasted vegetables and spinach that we ordered were good .Pistachio dessert was at best average
3
Spigola with roasted potatoes and tomatoes was nice. Others are not that special and did not taste that authentic Italian. Homemade pasta was more like soft noodle and the prawn used was not of high quality considering the price.Location is a bit hard to find in the middle of arts center building
4
We had a very enjoyable evening at La Barca with attentive service from the staff. The only minor thing was the carbonara that was too dry and had overcooked bacon in it but the other dishes from starters to desserts were fine. We'll be back.
2
Definitely short of staff to handle two birthday party and full house situation. Staff was too busy and keep forgetting us, missing cutlery, plates, bread, and chairs?!
It was my second visit, so sad to see the service standard has drop so much.
5
Dinner with friends and love the grilled squid and broccoli angel hair ... service was good and was not rushed ...
2
Staff does not seem to be happy to work here and didn't pay attention to us. Manager wasn't friendly at all. Food is ok but we left feeling unhappy about the place.
3
Nice and cosy place. Food was nice but portion is pretty small especially for the price. Would recommend to try.
5
We went for my wife's birthday, and the restaurant was very kind to waive corkage to accommodate us bringing a special bottle of wine for the occasion. The restaurant manager and staff were very engaging and gave tip top recommendations and service. This restaurant is highly recommended
5
We had a special birthday dinner there. The staff were really friendly and accommodating to our requests. The service was very good and the food, awesome. It was located at a quiet but central location so you could enjoy a private dinner with very easy commute. There was also a playground right next to the outdoor Alfresco, so if you have kids, it is a perfect choice. We would definitely go back again
5
Got introduced to this restaurant by my french friend. Found the place really cozy and informal.There is a separate indoor and outdoor play area for the kids, I think its a well though of arrangement to keep kids busy while parents can have some relaxing time indulging in wine and food. We ordered for meat and cheese platter perfectly complemented by prosecco to sip. Later, we ordered for sausages and lasagna. The taste was just perfect for the hot afternoon, not too spicy or hot. The staff was courteous and went out of the way to make our experience really good.Lastly ended up ordering Tiramisu to square it off with some sweetness and get a subtle savor of italian cuisine

La Barca is a quaint Italian Restaurant located in Goodman Art Centre Campus. This is the second gem that we discovered in the secluded area. The name La Barca came from an Italian word that means a boat, just like the shape of the restaurant. La Barca serves classic Tuscan fare with a modern twist, focusing on the fresh ingredients and stylish presentation. Their entrÃ©e of Parma Ham and Burrata is a must try (Il Prosciutto Di Parma, Burrata Di Andria, Pomodori E Basilico - $40). The price might look stiff at first, but the portion does not disappoint. It is huge and enough for 4 pax. Thinly shaved saltish and delicate Parma ham combine soft, creamy and bouncy organic burrata cheese sure fire up our appetite and looking forward to the next dish. Pizza lovers will be satisfied as well. Though their offering is not extensive, they are generally very good. The dough of the pizza is crisp on the exterior while slightly chewy in the interior. The toppings are generous. We tried Fungi Freschi Misti pizza ($22) and seafood pizza (Pizza Con Pesce Fresco Senza Mozzarella - $24). The toppings filled the pizza to the max, where the pizza still have its crisp texture and does not go soggy. The seafood toppings included ocean fresh fish, squid, cuttlefish, prawns, octopus, mussels, clams definitely showcase the goodness from the sea. I Tortelli Di Pecorino Con Fonduta Di Parmigiano E Tartufo Di Stagione ($42) is Chef Michele's award-winning pasta. Rich and creamy cheese tortelli, topped with pecorino cheese plus a seasonal truffle. Yum Yum. We just hope the portion can be adjusted. If you have this dish as part of your 5-course meal, I say the portion is just nice. But for small family / communal dining, it will be good to increase the portion by about 25% so everyone can get a decent bite. Since La Barca is a Tuscan restaurant, the traditional Fiorentina steak is a must try. Australian Angus Beef, marbling score 3 ($18 per 100 gram). Minimum order for the steak is about 800 gram, so it is definitely made for sharing. The service staff will show us the steak after it comes off the grill. It is then brought to the kitchen to be cut. Both time we tried the steak, it was cooked just slightly before it reaches medium rare. It is meaty, juicy and succulent. The wedges and cannelli beans is a good companion for the meal. You can order other side dishes like mash potatoes, sauteed Italian spinach, shoe-string fries, etc. In case the steak is underdone for you, you can ask the service staff for the hot-stone and you can grill it a bit more on the table. For the sweet ending, our picks are Tiramisu Tradizionale La Barca ($14) and Strudel Di Mele Banane Alla Cannella Con Salsa Di Vaniglia ($14). The tiramisu is without alcohol and cream. Using eggs as the base ingredients, It is smooth, creamy and packs a solid coffee punch. The presentation looks a bit like someone spilled a spoonful of milo on the desserts, however, it is a must try dessert. The strudel has an attractive texture of crispy exterior and moist interior. The fillings of organic apple and banana are wrapped in pastry sheets, then deep fried. The use of vanilla cream instead of ice cream actually a good choice here, so the strudel maintain its crispy texture. The berries provide a good balance to this sweet dish. The restaurant is spacious. The seats are well spread out and enough distance between tables to retain the privacy between diners. The main dining area will be indoor, but you can also seat outside for drinks and chill out. There is indoor and outdoor playing area for family coming with children. So it is a good place for families to meet up. Service is efficient, friendly and professional. Overall, the food at La Barca is definitely something to look forward to. It is a place where you can get great Tuscan food, suitable for formal dining or family dining out. Price is on the high side, however, you will be getting what you paid for. Ciao!! Cheers!

I came here for our wedding anniversary dinner. I've made a reservation beforehand, telling them that we will be celebrating out wedding anniversary over there. Usually, even for a lower end restaurant, they would have at least say "Happy Anniversary" to us once we were there. But for this restaurant, I don't know what is the waiter and floor manager busy with. We were there standing, waiting to be seated. Only around 3 tables were filled with people with lots of empty tables. After getting seated, I need to stand up and walk over to the floor manager and told him that we would like to order, cos they sort of "unable to see us", weird. Food was ok, too experimental for some, especially for "La Carne" , it was kinda raw/uncooked/cold in the middle. We thought it was suppose to be like this and we ignored.The rest of the dishes were alright. Not amazing. They do have kids play area indoor(filty) and outdoor(not so bad). I really question their michelin star though
5
Superb food. Good service. Nice setting for kids. Extensive Italian menu. Lovely place to relax for a nice meal.
4
Really good food. Steak is divine. Great space for families. Service is impeccable. Food service was quick.
On the pricey side but similar to top restaurants around town.
4
The florentine steak is good! Very tender. Although the price is a bit steep the steak quality is good.
5
Great food and service. Real traditional Italian food. You should try the sea bass and the seafood spaghetti. Al dente like the best! Ambience could improve a little with more careful lighting
4
Overall service of the place was good. Although it could be abit hard to get their attention at times as there was a large group. Food was great! Would definitely recommend the lobster bisque.
3
Very kid friendly (i dont have any). Trampoline, water slide, playroom, bouncy castle... pasta was average, portion was small, not justifying the price. Pizza was decent.
5
Authentic Italian food. Everybody loved the florentina steak. Appetizers and pasta dishes are great as well.
4
If you need a spot that combines Sunday brunch spread with plenty of kids activities at the side while you catch up with the adults, saunter into la Barca. The food is so so but the plenty of kids fun in the form of trampoline, kids water slide, kids playroom and a playground give you ample me time or adult time. And opt for the reasonable free flow at $45

La Barca, located at Goodman Arts Centre, which is in the Mountbatten area, near National Stadium. This Italian restaurant was recommended by a good Italian friend of mine, after all what I can say it was real Italian affair, I would never know there’s an Italian restaurant located here at all. We ordered variety of food and while we waited for the food, we noticed children playing in the indoor play room, entertained with a cartoon movie or the room full of toys. This is very different to other upmarket restaurant I guess it’s great for family’s with kids. Anyway the food arrived and to start we had Pizza Al Prosciutto Crudo Di Parma. The crust offers a good bite and nicely done. The tomato based has a unique flavour, topped with mozzarella and Parma Ham, The flavor is real authentic. Very Good. The highlight of our dinner was Spaghetti Aglio Olio E Frutti Di Mare, Spaghetti with seafood and olive oil, it’s done extremely well. The sauce is all natural, with flavors from the prawns, clams, squid and octopus leg. Very Very Very good! Finally the Florentine steak top them all, it was Very tender melt in your mouth. The quality of food here is good. I also noticed an ‘Osteria Italia’ sign inside the restaurant, which is only given to restaurants who are certified to use a large portion of their ingredients sourced from Italy. Service is impeccable, Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. Food is on the pricey side but similar to top restaurants around town. This is a very good find, and it’s definitely on my list of go-to places to dine for Italian food. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon

La Barca is my go-to place for a wine dinner on weekday, as it has free corkage on Tuesday and Wednesday. Quality of food is consistent. Wait staff are the same friendly faces and provide patient service. It's a kid-friendly place with an indoor playroom and outdoor "playground". Not many places serve fiorentina steak, so if you and your friends are famished, this is the place to go. Be sure to indicate in your reservation that you would like to order the steak (smallest is 800g to 1kg), as it is a popular menu item
4
A superb restaurant serving consistently very autyhentic Italian food even my true blue Italian connosuier agrees
But to note it's can be expensive
4
We had dinner there on a Friday night and had the florentina steak which was good. The service was friendly and the atmosphere nice. But it was a little. Pricey for what it was.
5
One of our most memorable restaurant experiences. Everything from the ambience to the food to the service was perfect. A real hidden gem in the east.
2
The tortellini with truffle was overpriced. The portion was small.....I could eat 5 portions to be as satiated as a normal pasta.
4
Love the indoor and outdoor play areas, which are more spacious and better than just the bouncy castle at Melba. Service could be better though. Was there on a Sat evening and it wasn't crowded but service staff weren't very attentive.
1
Reviews online were good but every dish was disappointing and extremely overpriced, especially the soups. Basic pizzas and pastas were hard to even swallow
5
My friend gave me 1 for 1 meal Entertainer app promotion for La Berca. My boyfriend and I went there for dinner and birthday celebration. Staff there were friendly and food was delicious and rich in taste! The manager was also kind enough to treat us a free Tiramisu dessert for birthday celebration! Thank you
4
We had a large group of 12 ( do reserve before hand) Excellent Italian food. We had the steak and the Sea Bass: both were wonderfully done. This might will have been the best fish I have had in a Western restaurant in Singapore. The restaurant is set in an old school in Singapore; so it has quite a different feel. It doesn't have that stuffy feeling to it so it is great for families
4
Not only the food is very good but the place is fantastic to enjoy a nice brunch with children.We came with 7 children from 3 to 9 and after pasta and pizza, they enjoyed the indoor and outdoor plays. It would have been even better with swimwear as there is a small Swimming pool. The place is also very safe, far from road.About the food he recommend the appetisers with mozzarella, Parma ham, etc. Variety is good and products are very fresh.
5
Have always liked the food here. The fiorentino beef and burrata and prosciutto are to die for.But decided to try something different tonight and we were not disappointed. Tried the warm blue crab and prawns with avocado. Yums!My son has the prosciutto pizza and a meat spaghetti. Excellent and also dente. Tried the ocean sea bass for 2 and it was really really fresh. Loved the topping of baked potatoes (some baked so crisp like potato chips) and olives and tomatoes.Always an excellent place for dinner. What's more it's BYO Tuesday, so had a 2011 Smith Haut Lafitte.....hmmmm
5
Perfect for family with young kids and parents get to enjoy free flow of prosecco. Our regular Sundays.
5
Decent quality for brunch but the play area is simply fantastic which makes it a beautiful Sunday !! But quite full and had to make reservation
5
there were 4 playgrounds for this restaurant ,one needed to wear swimming costume.the spaggetti was very tasty
3
Good steak. Good pizza. Nice entree. But couldn't divide the bill by 8 at the end of the night which made it complicated.
4
Roasted pork and the lamb cutlets were nicely cooked and tasted authentically Italian. Kids really enjoyed the playroom and bouncy castle (but check when available as perhaps not always). Palming the kids off and coming back asap just the two of us!
5
We decided to order the fiorentina steak and the whole family all gave it a thumbs up ! Michael was our server and was very attentive throughout. He even presented my son a surprise birthday cake ! Will certainly be coming back very soon to try the pasta next
1
Was there with family, the boss took our order and money and didn't find us a table. After much waiting there was finally an empty table and we sat down. Only to be chased out by the boss, saying inside air-conditioned seats were only for reservations. (There wasn't any reservations to begin with!) So we asked to be seated outside and he said no seats. And walked off. 30 mins later, we were still not attended to and so we demanded for our money back and he said wait. And walked off! When we went after him and demanded for our money back he said wait again. Go only if you want to be treated like trash.
1
We purposely chose to come here for dinner and celebrate a friend's birthday. And so the cake was meant as a surprise. Not only did they want to charge a $5 corkage per person, they also obviously RUINED the surprise by coming to the table to announce about the corkage. Turns out birthday boy says he won't be coming back anymore. And I think neither will we ever either.Thank you for embarrassing us with a disappointing birthday evening, absolutely "well done" La Barca.

Last year after riding OCBC Cycle 2015 (42km), we went to search and explore Pietrasenta italian restaurant at Portsdown Rd for dinner.This year sticking to tradition, we rode in OCBC Cycle 2016 (42km) and we went to explore La Barca at Goodman Rd to give ourselves a nice dinner treat after a cycling activity in the morning. La Barco at Goodman Rd is a quiet place near Montbatten Rd area and not so easy to find but we managed at the end.There was 5 of us. We ordered starters a full squid calamari (the sauce was good and we used it as dip for our bread rolls). The second starter was eggplant thinly sliced done like lagsana style. The third start was parma ham with sweet large tomatoes and cheese. We tried 2 pasta (one is seafood alio olio and other is 2 types of cheese) which were recommended by the manager and the main course was a over baked whole seabass with cherry tomotoes, olives, onions and patatoes drizzled with olive oil and salt. For dessert we tried the regular tiramisu and a strudel. We saw other guest ordering the florentine steak and that where we learnt abit more about the Chianina cow which the meat comes from. Its a huge animal (especially the bull). Do check it out on google to get some idea of this cow.The place is very nice and comfortable. quiet but the music they played on a tad too loud. We saw 3 families with very young kids and I think they have some children's play facilities to keep them occupied. Overall the environment is nice and the staff are all friendly. The manager is Italian and came to talk to us and helped us with some recommendations. If we come back, we would like to try the beef or pork steak:
5
My wife and I celebrated our 20th anniversary at La Barca. We love this restaurant at Goodman Arts Centre. The ambience is classy, clean, spacious and cozy too but not over the top. The choice of wine was sold out and we were recommended a more expensive wine at the price of our initial choice. Impressive. Turned out to be an amazing wine. The burrata and parma ham is always on our list. My wife had a pork tenderloin which was cooked rare medium. Surprisingly good for pork. I had a beef tenderloin cooked to perfection. Together with the great wine a perfect combination. After that we asked for a plate of cheese. They serve a great variety of parmiggiano, peccorino and other delicious sheep, goat and cow cheese. Our plate was decorated very lovely to celebrate our anniversary. Everyone made a great effort to make this dinner a memoriable experience, from entering the restaurant to the starter, wine, main dish and cheese all served with great passion. A BIG THANK YOU to the team at La Barca - you made our anniversary an exciting event
4
this is the perfect place for frazzled parents on a Sunday...free flow prosecco with a bouncy castle, water castle and trampoline for the kids... foods very tasty too...service pretty good and the kids were happy! what more can you want on a Sunday!
5
Ordered the burratina cheese with Parma ham, chef's special pasta and beef tenderloin. Excellent stuff. A+++
5
Food was decent...not quite Michelin Star quality as expected, but I would definitely go back because the entire dining experience was highly enjoyable.
5
In a nice settimg, good food, and excellent service. I will sure to be back to try more of their menu.
5
This place in Goodmans Art Center is a must for Sunday family brunch offering all kinds of entertainment for the kids, so parents can enjoy their brunch (bouncy castle, water slide, trampoline and AC kids playroom)Excellent true Italian food with the bisteca fiorentina , the tiramisu and the homemade vanilla ice-cream among their highlights. The pizza crust is great and a bottle of Prosecco is affordable.Couples for a romantic dinner should rather convene in the evening
4
Overall, a good place if you are looking for a "family friendly fine dining" (if that makes sense) place. When we went, there was a trampoline, one bouncy castle and a bouncy castle with a mini pool set up on the outside of the restaurant. There was also a kids play room that was equipped with all manner of toys, TV, etc. A good place for the adults to relax and enjoy a nice meal while the kids entertain themselves. We ordered the steak, which was tasty and very nicely executed. Our daughter had the pasta ragu from the children's menu, which was mediocre, nothing to shout about. We rounded off the night with some tiramisu, which was decent but (I know this might sound strange) too chilled / cold (?) for my liking. Service was good. Attentive but not obtrusive. A nice experience overall

Decided to go here as I had read a review on "HungryGoWhere" that said their La Fiorentina steak was really good and I wanted a steak. The restaurant is tucked away in the Goodman Arts Centre but its easy to get to in a taxi. We had a table booked for 7pm but we need't have made a reservation as there was plenty of room. The restaurant is quite large and the interior looks a little tired. The Italian "Il maître" (Maitre d') came over and explained the menu and gave us the background on the wine we had chosen. I was impressed and though this was an indication of the level of service we were going to get through dinner. Sadly not. To start my wife and I shared a plate of prosciutto di parma with burrata cheese, tomatoes and basil. the burrata cheese was amazing. Incredibly fresh, creamy and flavourful. The prosciutto was good too. The tomatoes were disappointing though. Cheap ordinary salad toms that were slightly under-ripe and the basil....there was one leaf on the plate. I did ask for more which they promptly brought.For the main course I had decided on the La Fiorentina (T-bone) which was priced at $18 per 100g, which I thought was reasonable (for Singapore). I said that I would have a 400g steak and was told that it is actually for two persons and is 1kg in weight. We decided to go for this. The steak is served medium rare and pre-sliced, and they also serve it with a hot stone at the table so that you can cook it some more if you prefer.The flavour of the steak was good but there was quite a bit of fatty/gristle. It was served with potato wedges and cannellini beans. The wedges were ok (nothing special) but the cannelloni beans were awful. I am also not convinced that he pre-cooked weight was anything near the 1.1kg that we were charged for.For desert my wife chose the creme brûlée with lemon zest and I chose the dark chocolate Belgian tart. The tart was rather dry and underwhelming came with very little white chocolate sauce and I tasted the creme brûlée and thought the lemon zest was over-powering and that the cream was too runny and lacked flavour.All in all the meal was ok but certainly nothing to write home about. Service was poor to average (except for the "Il maître" who was actually Italian).As for price, it was not worth the money ($198++ for an average t-bone steak)I wouldn't recommend this place
2
Soup was rather expensive and tasted more like stew than a soup persay.Slipper lobster spaghetti was a huge disappointment with dry and hard pasta mixed with few small pieces of lobster meat.Risotto was slightly better but nothing to wow about.In general the dinner experience wasn't that great, having gone in with high expectations
4
No matter the age of your child, with bouncy castle, water slide castle, trampoline, indoor play centre and fusball table, there's something for everyone. And the staff are wonderful. The manager/owner even ran to the front entrance to get our taxi and bring it closer to the restaurant; above and beyond the call of duty. The food was good, I was expecting a little more from the flavours, but I'll be going back again to try some other dishes to see if this was just a dish specific report. The kids menu could be bigger, boasting pasta or pizza, but my kids devoured it.
4
The food was great! It's not cheap but it's not super expensive and it all tasted really good. I really like the carbonara pasta I got. The spot feels sort of random, it's back in some kind of art complex. Cool place, but I was surprised it was so hidden. The staff were nice, they even called a taxi for us.
5
La Barca is a real Italian restaurant. Quality of food and wine are superb with a good price. La Barca cuisine is quite simple but effective. Is a great place for families during the day and a nice place for couples and friends at night!!!
4
Great place for couple. Cosy and romantic. The roasted chicken (whole chicken) is recommended by the waiter. Although a little pricy ($60), still worth. Skin is crispy and meat is juicy.
5
Delicious food, great ambiance, first class service. We will definitely come back! Although the wine list is quite short, the qualityv cc v x x
4
Great service and food. Celebrated hubby's birthday there. Got a red wine recommendation from the crew and it was smooth and awesome.
4
Ordered the home made green pasta with prawns and spinach that was yummy but portion a bit small. Also had the sausage pizza that was yummy too. Went using the entertainer- unfortunately couldn't use it on the mains. Quite affordable with the entertainer otherwise I would have found it pricey.
4
Boyfriend brought me here for a really lovely birthday dinner. The food is pretty authentic Italian fare. We had the scallops, homemade angel hair pasta with prawns and Tuscany Pici with pork ragu, all tasty throughout. Service was attentive and friendly, restaurant is tucked away in an arts building, very quaint. The only slight downside is the rather high prices, comparable to that of fine dining establishments. Well, recommend to visit if you're looking to indulge
1
Chope and a call to the restaurant confirmed reservation on correct date/time, but was greeted by rude staff indicating no reservation and hand wave on the few limited available tables.Environment was filled with a nearby meat sizzling from table nearby.Poor food presentation and the standard of authentic Italian to be re-evaluated

In 2011, this fine dining restaurant called "The Boat" anchored itself in a quiet corner of Katong. Serving classic Tuscan fare, it is helmed by a Michelin chef listed in Frommer's Top Ten in Italy for the 9 years he were running it. The chef is a fervent protector of authencity and stresses he does not compromise on ingredients, using only the very finest produce, meats and fish. Even then, some reviewers complained that the pasta's al dente was too hard, and the dishes too salty. For me, I found them perfect.Yesterday, I had the good fortune of being invited for dinner here as a corporate guest to another company's anniversary dinner. Due to the lovely dining experience I had, I wanted to share this gem especially with fans of Italian fare.As a starter, we had Melanzane Parmaggiano ... Baked eggplant with mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce. The flavour had depth and added to that the dish was made made more interesting by the bits of that something which was simultaneously crispy and resilient. Nice!Then we had Trofie Ai Frutti Di Mare ... A kind of Mediterranean style short pasta with bits of various crunchy seafood, the savouring of which was akin to being immersed in a orchestra of harmonised tastes and texturesFollowing this was baked sea bass with cherry tomatoes, olives and capers. Restaurant stressed that the olives were the very same ones from which good quality olive oil was extracted from. Again, everything in this dish was well-concocted and blended perfectly. The fish was well-marinated, evidence that effort & time was invested to this end.Finally La Barca’s Traditional Tiramisu, Chocolate Tart with White Chocolate Sauce ...an alcohol-free dessert. It was stressed that tradionally, tiramisu had no alchohol in it. This was also really nice. Taking it was like savouring coffee-flavoured cream with chocolate.In short, everything here was a positively thumbs-up experience

I went to La Barca mainly because of the 1-for-1 deal with Entertainer. I wouldn't have bothered going there otherwise given the not-so-fantastic reviews I read here. The Manager (a rude italian) had the smart idea to title his menu "brunch" just to make customers not qualify for the 1-for-1. While this had nothing to do with a brunch as it is just the standard items with the standard expensive price: pizza, pasta etc...The staff was also very rude and super not smiling (no doubt when you have such a tricky Italian boss...).Finally the pizza was soso and the lamb was just ok.I will never go again to this place.To the Italian manager: if you are not happy with Entertainer and you pretend not to get anything out of it, resign from it, but attracting your customers with the app to later trick them shows a lot on how you maintain your business. I can't imagine what may also happen in your kitchen...There are many better and honest italian chef in town

My friend had recommended me to this Italian restaurant recently. This restaurant is located at Goodman Arts Centre, which is in the Montbatten area, near National Stadium. I would never know there’s a Italian restaurant located here at all!I popped by one recent Sunday for lunch with the family. As it was a Sunday, the restaurant had set up an outdoor water play area with water slides and water fountains to entertain the kids. There was also a trampoline for the kids to jump in. These were unsheltered. There was another bouncy castle in the sheltered area and an indoor air-conditioned room, where the children can be kept entertained with a cartoon movie or the room full of toys.  They also have changing booths and towels to dry the children down after their water-play. It's thoughtful of the restaurant!I ordered some food and while we waited for the food, the kids played in the indoor play room. Here are the highlights of my meal:- The Italian Hamburger. Available only on weekends. The beef patty is made inhouse by the chef, who achieved 1 Michelin star when he helmed the kitchen in Italy. The patty sits between lettuce leaves and sliced tomato and two buns. It comes with two sunny side up eggs topped with Parma ham, tomatoes with Burrata cheese and potato wedges. This filled me up and I am struggling to stay awake after lunch. - Pizza Al Proscuitto Crudo Di Parma. The crust offers a good bite and nicely done. It is tomato based and it has a unique flavor. Topped with mozzarella and Parma Ham. The flavor is authentic. Good. They also gave a bacon and eggs pizza which I will try on my next visit.- The highlight of my lunch today - Spaghetti Aglio Olio E Frutti Di Mare. Spaghetti with seafood and olive oil. It's done very well. The sauce is all natural, with flavors from the prawns, clams, squid and octopus leg. No white wine, no tomato sauce, no garlic to mask the flavors. I was scooping up every last bit of the sauce at the bottom of the plate. Very good!The quality of food here is good. I also noticed an ‘Osteria Italia’ sign inside the restaurant, which is only given to restaurants who are certified to use a large portion of their ingredients sourced from Italy.On weekends, this restaurant is great for parents, who can have a meal while the children are kept entertained.This is a very good find, and it’s definitely on my list of go-to places to dine for Italian food. Recommended

Had brunch there. Lots for the children to do while waiting for the meal- water based based bouncy Castle, trampoline, table football (needs a serious clean :-( ). My warm seafood salad was very good with some of the most tender octopus and calamari I have tasted. Buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes salad was also very good but potions a tad small for the price. Vegetable omelet very good as was the Scrambled egg, mozzarella egg bread, home made sausage and beans. Coffee and fruit juices were also very good.

Our appointment was 630pm it is good time as the dinner crowd would come in much later. The place was rather quiet however noticed a party in the corner of the resturant. Warm bread was served before our food arrived. We had antipasti with assortments of Italian cold cuts, cheeses, bruschetta and assorted pickles. There is assortment of saltiness of the dry meat, crunchiness/sourness of pickles and bruschetta and creaminess of the buffalo mozzarella bursting in the mouth. All worked the appetite. Lobster bisque was creamy and flavorful. The Tortellini Di Pecorino with Parmesan cream and seasonal truffles was creamy very tasty and earthy with each mouthful of truffle. Our final order was the florentine steak it came a little too rare however it was good. The service was good in the earlier part of the evening but as soon as the party was in full swing service deteriorate

Had a great time at la barca ristorante. The kids enjoyed the outside pool area and the trampoline. Great seating arranged by the staff as well so it made it is easy to Keep and eye on the kids. Also they went out off their way post the close of the kitchen time to still serve us desserts. Tiramisu and chocolate tart were great. So thank you to the chef and the team. Well done
5
If anyone tells you otherwise, they obviously have not been here. It is a destination point but makes it all worthwhile. The Florentine steaks are superb! Michele, former Michelin starred restaurant chef, ensures the meats are grilled to perfection. Worth a visit anytime.Been there total of 5-6 times

Food in La Barca was fantastic, fine dining standards. We ordered the Parma ham with burratina as a starter to share. It was delightful to see your Parma ham carved in front of you by the Chef, before it is put on your table. Definitely makes it even more tasty! For mains, we ordered the Lamb fillet and Beef tenderloin. Both dishes were beautifully presented, with flavours that worked so well together. The lamb fillet came in medallions, with a crispy bacon and olive tapenade. The beef tenderloin was wrapped in proscuittto, served with a medley of japanese mushrooms on the side, and a drizzle of pesto. Both the lamb and beef was cooked to perfection.Service was impeccable. They were always very attentive, and kept a polite distance. We tasted the wine that we just ordered and it tasted quite tight. Then our waiter quickly offered to decant our wine - what a treat! La Barca is located in an Arts Centre, facing a grassy field with a huge sculpture. It has a really unique setting. The restaurant is quite big, so it might abit cold brrr! I would recommend La Barca for lovely evenings!Oh ya - I smelt food from another table, which was pretty amazing. Their beef was being cooked on a hotplate at their table. Definitely makes me want to go back there to try that soon

Absolutely fantastic place! Immaculate service Atmosphere is lovely The food was amazing. I ordered for my main the Totelli truffle dish and I was a bit disappointed by the size initially. It turns out it was amazing. Presentation of the food is gorgeous. We came thanks to my 'entertainer' discount but I will definitely return regardless of any future discounts. V impressed by the quality

The decor, seemed like its just missing something. Though overall it was pleasant.Good for italian steak. Two of us had a 1.2 kg florentine steak. Although i would have preferred the beef either to be more marbled or to be aged to concentrate the flavour, still a pleasant meal. I didnt like the fact that the meat was served luke warm. Fortunately there was a hot stone provided.Risotto was disappointing the stock wasn't restaurant standard.Service was frenl

Celebrated friends' birthday at this restaurant. Not easy to locate location, pls check new location as they mentioned that their current lease is running out before year end. Good selection of pasta, but the main event is the Florentine steak which is great. There is also good selection of wine and desserts
5
This place is really elegant, is this a five-star restaurant where you can feel and be treated as a queen or king. I forgot how many dishes I had on my table, but I enjoyed each of them. Definitely this is the place that I would like to go back again
5
La Barca is well worthy of praise. This hidden away Italian is worth hunting down. From the special grill for the Bistecca to the A grade pasta, everything is delicious and authentic.We had the treat of the Porceta which was beyond perfect and perhaps the best pork I have ever had - so amazingly tender!!Unusual venue location but look past that and enjoy a truely incredible italian dining experience
4
Was recommended this place by an Italian friend. Very classy restaurant serving authentic Italian food! Not cheap but value for what you will be served. We ordered the traditional Fiorentine steak and have always liked it since our first visit. Very tender meat and deliciously seasoned.. and you can request for a hotplate to manage the "doneness" of your own slice of beef. ;)Only one thing we werent v pleased with : on our last visit, we had accidentally topple my wine glass over and it was half-filled, in such a top restaurant as this, I would expect them to fill my glass again as a gesture of goodwill/service but that was not done.. we left it as that of coz. :) Tip : if you have the entertainer app, you will enjoy 1-1 discounts for mains! :) Of coz, wont work with the steak because it's usually 1-1.2kg and for 2pax already.Enjoy!

This restaurant is quite difficult to find and maybe a phone call asking for directions would be a good idea. We went with friends who had been once before and still had a little difficulty in finding the right corridors to get to it. The menu is an excellent journey through various different styles of Italian cooking. It tasted really authentic, the welcome from the staff is warm and we had a good table. Service was attentive without being too hurried, our evening was relaxed and we all enjoyed our chosen dishes. I would definitely return again. It is not a cheap night out, but good food in Singapore is definitely not cheap. I feel that we got what we had paid for - fresh ingredients prepared by a chef who delights in his work
5
This is my husband's and my favourite restaurant in Singapore. Great food and decent price. Our experience is made all the more special as you feel very welcomed by Chef Michele. He really does put his heart and soul into his cooking and menu always changing. Wine list is very comprehensive, with some serious Italian wines, and not at outrageous prices. Feel this place is totally under rated purely because of it's location, which is Goodman's Art Centre and maybe out of the way for some people. However we live on East Coast and go there a lot
4
A bit difficult to find it but worth to spend some time to get there.High standard and refine dishes for a genuine Italian taste. Excellent the "Fiorentina Steak" which I really recommend it !!Thanks to Chef Michele for his courtesy and care to our table during our dinner

After reading so many reviews, some favourable, some not so, I decided to go and experience for myself. It was pricey all right. For mains we ordered the 'Traditional Fiorentina with Truffle Sauce' or the Premium Grain-Fed Wagyu Beef from Australia at $20/100gm. It is meant for two persons at 1.2 kg with bone.This alone cost $240.We shared a soup starter, and a dessert, and had two coffees. The entire meal cost almost $350 including service charge and GST. We brought our own bottle of wine since there was no corkage on Wednesday evenings.The meat was a disappointment. It wasn't melt-in-the-mouth. It was rather chewy. The steak knives were not sharp enough. However the truffle sauce was superb.The lobster bisque was really good.For dessert we had the rhubarb cannolo. It was sweet, not sour enough. The sweet filling of pistachio cream, meant to be a counterfoil to the sourness of the rhubarb, by itself was good, and possibly would be better if the rhubarb can be tasted.I might come again, to try fish, and pasta. I like the location.The ambience was of that of a top end formal dining room. And the fact that the restaurant is located in a quiet neighbourhood and inside the compound of an art school, adds to its attractiveness. It is in a unique location.The service staff were friendly; but the chef owner was aloof. Only three tables were occupied with seven diners. The chef walked through about three times and never once stopped by to chat, although I nodded to him once and he nodded back. Parking may be a problem depending on the crowd. Call ahead 9710 8208, just as you arrive, to find out if there are parking spaces left, behind the kitchen. Else one would have to park near the security post and walk about 5-10 mins along a corridor to the restaurant. Don't forget to ask the restaurant for a complimentary parking coupon

I celebrated my wedding anniversary here with my husband as we had honeymooned in Tuscany and wanted to relive that special time. Quite easy to find thanks to the signage but a strange location as it felt like we were walking through school after hours. The food was, as recommended, truly delicious. My veal carpaccio was very tasty and my husband enjoyed his oven baked eggplants. We chose the $50 steaks, as really couldn't stomach the price of the other steak dishes as the waiter told us the smallest cut was 1kg. But the most disappointing was the ambiance. The lights were so bright and created no mood whatsoever. The service was very good with attentive waitstaff but at 10pm, despite other diners in the restaurant, they decided to clear the tables and reset for breakfast. We felt very unwanted at this stage and left soon after
5
Though La Barca may be a little off the beaten track, the journey is well worth it just to sample their exquisite beef steaks and variety of authentic pasta dishes. It’s a great place to spend a weekend lunch, and as it’s in the Goodman Arts Centre, the setting is a little different, with a large yard area that you can relax in with family or friends
2
I was very disappointed to their food for the price I paid.Seafood on spaghetti felt like frozen seafood sold at supermarket. Portion was also very small. 24++ is too expensive for this quality even for Singapore.Mixed salad was 14++ but very average.Chocolate tarte was 14++, disappointing, too. Not much chocolate...Compared to the price and quality of the Italian restaurants in city center, there was nothing that this place made us feel like coming back.For the bathroom, you have to use those of the Art Center and it is of standard Singapore local quality
5
The restaurant is located inside the Goodman Art's Centre and we were tipped off by our friend to go there. It is not easy to find at the beginning but I treasured the experience. It is a nice restaurant for lunch and dinner. The food is good and authentic. I enjoyed their appetiser - whether cod fish, or baked egg plants with cheese, or warm seafood salad, and the pici with ragu sauce, and their signature dish, Florentina steak. If you love Italian food, this is the restaurant you should go

My wife and I went for dinner to La Barca Ristorante to celebrate her birthday, on the recommendation of a foodie friend.We were pleasantly surprised: even though the location is a bit odd, inside an Arts and Crafts complex, the restaurant itself is very pleasant and classy.Food was good - the risotto and the truffle tortellini were delicious. Since we are not into steak, we could not sample the house specialty, the Bistecca Fiorentina. But judging from the looks of satisfaction in other tables, we could gauge its quality to be high.Service was very polite and pleasant, and they even included a complimentary birthday tiramisu dessert for my wife - though we only mentioned "...birthday..." very briefly to the waitress at the start of the meal.This was a really nice touch, and sealed a great evening.In short; a good Italian option with pleasant service and a commensurate price. We will come back
5
My 1st time here, was pleasently surprise by the cozy place. Was told the florentine steak is a must try. So we ordered the smallest one, rhat day 1KG.!!! Share 3 way. It is good.
4
Me and my family met some friends over there with their kids. We spent a great moment on a Sunday afternoon. There was a playground for the kids and it will band (made by other kids) was playing musicThe service was good. We took quite a lot of space inside then moved outside and they didn't make any problem. The food was okay but expensive. We took a big piece of beef (1,5kg) but I was a bit disappointed by the size although it was good. I still give it 4 stars because I really enjoyed the moment.
4
I have visited La Barca for the 4th time within 1 year.Their truffle sauce wagyu beef steak remains the best steak ever!Their pizza is also very delicious. The crust is thin and light.The beef pizza and the vegetarian pizza are the best pizzas I have ever tasted!The disadvantage about this place is that the waiter may not be aware of the promotion of 10% (used to be 15%) discount on Thursday, and if you do not ask them, they may not give you the discount, which happened to me before. Also they do not ask you if you have the particular credit card which has a discount unless you specifically ask them.Finally, they do not offer you the complimentary parking coupon unless you ask them

I went to this place with friends for lunch, after reading contrasting reviews about it (and wondering why there are people writing twice a terrible review for the same experience!?!).The place is totally unusual, in the middle of a kind of art school, very spacious inside and with a large space outside. The staff was very professional (above the standard in Singapore) and we were welcomed by the chef and his helper. We had some simple dishes from the brunch menu (omelette with grilled vegetables and beans or roast beef): they were rich and good at reasonable prices. After the lunch we moved on the table outside, where we had our coffee and we spend some more time talking on the sofa.We were very happy to have found such a pleasant and quite place where to find again the same atmosphere we used to experience when in Italy. I cannot say too much about the quality of food, as we had very easy dishes (that we enjoyed anyway), and we will definitely go again to try some of the interesting dishes from the dinner menu. But I can assure of the authenticity of the atmosphere you can experience in this place. And now that I have experienced it I can understand some of the terrible reviews from local people
3
This is restaurant is recommended by another restaurant manager. I am quite surprise of the location of this restaurant. You could hardly imagine the restaurant is located in a very ordinary arts centre (just like a school)The food quality is average. But they do provide a very relaxing environment. If you are looking for a quiet and relax dinning experience. La Barca could provide you both. PS: even my Singaporean friend living in east coast also do not know this restaurant
4
We had discovered Pici during our trip to Tuscany last year. Its a pasta unique to Tuscany (in fact to Siena region which is where La Barca's Chef Michele is from).Last night at La Barca we had Pici as good as any we had in Tuscany.I know some others have complained about the service etc. but we found the staff very pleasant, attentive without being in your face (& the restaurant was busy!). The food arrived in good time & was fresh with delicate flavours.We will certainly be going back to La Barca regularly & would highly recommend it
1
Awful, Avoid this place, I am an ang moh and I know what this should taste like... Dominos is more italian,So much salt!!!!, I seriously could not eat it the (supermarket packet) linguine. I obviously hadn't touched it at all and the wait staff didn't ask me if anything was wrong with it.Considering if I took anything more than 1 bite it would have looked as if I had fisnished it.The food took ages.. and it is all over priced.Really hard to find, and reall not worth finding
3
Read several good reviews of this place. Personally, I didn't find it that good. 1st impression when entering the restaurant was nice ambiance and spacious. The restaurant was not packed (we were 3rd group of customers to be seated) when we placed our orders yet the 1st dish of appetizer was served after 25 mins and the rest came 5 mins after one another. Be patient. All the dished were quite salty to my liking. My only recommendation was Sea Bass (portion for 2 persons), which was a whopping $60. Caramel tea was $10/pot/person. Dinner for 5 persons costed nearly $400 with 2 glasses of wine. Hoo!As this restaurant is located within the Art Centre, the restaurant may look nice but hold your breathe if you have to use the rest room
4
We always end up going to La Barca for a week end brunch.The pasta dishes are always greatly executed.The bellini is very reasonable at 12$/glass, one of the cheapest in Singapore.Service is friendly and personable. The location in the Goodman Arts Center feels away from the city and you can always take a stroll amongst the temporary exhibitions in the complex
5
Visited the restaurant with my family after recommendation from a family friend, and we didn't regret it at all!The location is not very accessible, but was perfect as that meant the restaurant was not too crowded, as a lot of places are in Singapore on weekends.Service was excellent and prompt, and the food was the same as well. We had a pizza (remember to eat it hot!) and the T-bone steak which was the highlight of the evening. The beef was tender, and they provided a hot plate for you to self-cook it to how you'd like it done. Dessert wise, there was plenty to choose from but we ended with the Rum and Hazelnut Parfait and Tiramisu, which were both yummy as well!Definitely worth the price tag, and would definitely be back again for more
5
Chef Michele has come out with a new menu....risotto, rabbit, truffle....etc Bravo. The Steak Florentine is not to be missed.Very reasonably priced for great honest Italian food.A must try.The restaurant is nicely decorated with fantastic service staff. You will be surprised where it is located - in the middle of an Art school. Definitely a rare find and a gem

La Barca is chucked in the old La Salle Arts school, near the Changi airport. The setting gives the restaurant a wonderful, quiet and artful ambience.I was there at 6.15pm, on my way to the airport for a business dinner. As the kitchen is not ready, the waitress recommended a bottle of nice, fresh white wine. I brought a 1988 Bordeaux too. We were pleasantly surprised that we enjoy free corkage as its Wednesday.In 15 minutes, our entree is served. The salmon, scallop and cod are wonderful, though the veal is too rare for my liking. Our main is the famous Fiorentina beef, shared by 4 of us. It is wonderfully cooked, with just pepper and salt. We are given a hot plate to cook the beef to our desire too. One of the best beef I tried in Singapore!Service level is fantastic. The waitresses are very attentive and efficient. In my rush to the airport, I left my wine carrier and cooler behind. I called the restaurant and they informed me that they will keep for me.I returned to La Barca 2 weeks later for dinner with my family. My wine carrier and cooler are still there
5
Always my favourite place for an authentic Italian meal, but tonight Michele lifted the bar again, suckling pig!!! His way. Awesome, this is available once every 3 weeks on Fridays, Saturday and Sundays according the Michele!If you are into truffles, Italian wines, steak and now added to the list Suckling Pig, then La Barca is it.Good luck with finding it the first time.Bring your friends so that you can squeeze in a pizza as well. Oh, and don't forget the cheese!!BTW, Michele is renowned for his small goods, so the cold meat platter is a must.Did I mention the wine, bring your credit card, but it is worth it!Enjo
4
Like to go there with the family, as there is an open area for them to run around after dinner. They also have kids menu.Someone told me the steak was good, but you didn't realise how good until you come here. Mama mia !!Ordered 2 pizzas, a kids plain one for the kids and a parma ham. Quite good but I prefer my crust a bit more...crusty. Also had a decent Penne Bolognese for kids. For starters, had the Mixed Mushroom Terrine, the Salmon Fillet stuffed with Seabass Fillet, and the Capricciosa Salad. First 2 were nice, salad was so-so (thought my wife's lettuce salad was just as good).Mains was of course the 1.1kg T-bone Bistecca Fiorentina, Seafood Aglio Olio, and Risotto with Fresh Asparagus. I loved them all :)p/s Service could be a bit slow at times, but hey, for the best steak, I wouldn't complain too much :)pp/s Warning for those bringing their own wines. Corkage is S$40 :

La Barca is the creation of a true blooded Italian from Siena where he held a restaurant and a Michelin star. He has now established himself at the Goodman Arts Centre where he has created a spacious and welcoming ambience akin to the front room of a family restaurant in Italy.The food and wine list are carefully thought through but are not overly fussy. All wines are Italian and carefully picked. Our 2006 Sangiovese was very tasty. The menu is not your standard Italian dishes which is refreshing and allows the diner to experiment a little more. There is a good balance of meat and fish dishes which are all well made and tasty.The service can be a little hit and miss and could benefit from further fine tuning. Nothing major though!The chef and owner took the time to meet and greet his customers and share his rich experiences of the restaurant trade.The challenge remains finding the restaurant which cannot be seen from the main road but is well sign posted once you have reached the Art Centre. This is an Italian where one goes to relax and enjoy the cooking rather to be seen. The good news is that the bill is way more reasonable than other top Italian restaurants in town

Went to La Barca to celebrate a friend's birthday as he liked the place and the location.Hits :Bistecca (Boned-In Steak from Aus) was excellent, it arrived at the table thinly sliced (bit too thin for my liking) and medium rare. It was accompanied by a Hot Stone, to be used to cook the steak a little more if any diners at the table wanted something more cooked than medium rare (nice touch). Steak was yummy, not marinated, flavor was all in the beef (which was nice because of all the marbling). Would have been better if it was charcoal-grilled.Totellini was excellent in a creamy cheese sauce which was top-grilled before serving.Linguine (or something that looked like udon) with pork was very good.Misses :The Grilled Suckling Pig was better as a showpiece. Chef Michele showed up with it and carved it at the empty table next to ours. I am used to having western-style suckling pig at other restaurants, and this one was "blah". Skin was semi-crispy and the flesh was over-powered by the rosemary (presumably to mask the piggy smell).The Spaghetti Bolognese was dry, but tasty.The Penne Pomodoro was small, even for our 7-year-old boy. Tasted ok.The Antipasto Meat Platter with Burrata was passable, but the burrata was not flavorful, seemed to be the mass-produced kind. Meat Terrine was awful. Other cold-cuts were ok
1
What a terrible experience last night: 10 minutes before a waiter noticed us at the door and showed us our seats while the restaurant was almost empty (3 staff passed in front of me without saying anything and I had to walk inside and ask for help myself!), really bad service (waiters didn't had a clue what the menu was all about) and most importantly BAD italian food (since when gnocchi al Granchio is so liquid that the texture is more like a soup??!!!). We paid and left without no one noticing us and said goodbye. Definitely not worth making all the trip there, especially for the high price... Run away
2
We ate here on a week night, excited to find a good restaurant within walking distance of Meyer Road. Unfortunately, we were very underwhelmed by the experience.The service was a little shaky overall we felt it was all a bit 'try hard' to be fancy and sophisticated without any real understanding about what makes a successful restaurant.We were given an amuse, lobster bisque, which had a nasty, bitter taste, almost chemical like, we neither of us finished it.The bread rolls were pre frozen and reheated, they went cold and tough very quicky.The platter of meat and cheese was good, the mozarella was fresh and very tasty, but unfortunately the pizza was not well balanced, using a strong cheese and with too much oil.For a starter between two, a pizza, a bowl of pasta and 4 beers, we paid $160 which is far too much for a local restaurant. They need to cut out the unnecessary amuse, chocolates and excess of staff, reduce the prices and concentrate on offering simple European food
4
We had our end of year Departmental Head get together there. Food was great, especially Steak Florentina. It's so good, it practically melts in our mouth. Service staff does not seem to understand English very well and can appear lost some times but no big issues as they are generally friendly.There is a big space for kids to run about, definitely a place for family.Love this place, will definitely be back
4
The start was not so good. Reserved a table inside but on arrival they said no table inside cos they had some flooding issue as it rained heavily earlier in the day. They had my reservation but they claimed that they did not have my mobile number. I remembered very clearly that I gave my number when I made my reservation. I insisted on a table inside and they relented. The waiters were attentive but they spoke very fast and quite inaudible. They did not inform us of the promotion and did not emphasize their speciality - the T bone steak. They have a 15% discount on their T bone steak evry Thursday night. This I read over the internet and from friends who patronized there. The waiter mentioned about some hot plate for us to cook the steak, but was not clear about it. When the steak came, they did not give us the hot plate until we requested for it. The hot plate is to cook the steak in case if you feel that it too rare. The hot plate is a very good idea!The steak was tender and juicy.It was the best steak I had!They served us complimentary soup. I think it was lobster bisque. The restaurant was full despite it being a Thursday, or perhaps it was due to the 15% every Thurdays on their T bone steak? I will definitely return to this restaurant. The steak here beats all steaks that I ever had hands down

We went to celebrate my birthday with the family, we all love italian food, high expectations due to the chef resume. Very nice design, impressive menu, very disappointing food, over priced bill. Never again.
3
Just returned from a dinner there with six friends on someone's recommendations. The restaurant itself has a nice ambience, with efficient service staff. We appreciated the free soup course, as well as the small dessert platter - the almond biscotti was very flavorful while the nougat was sweet but nice. Several of us ordered the pork ribs - each plate came with an enormous and very tasty rib (the chef used the salt to good effect, but the roasted fatty portion could have been a little more crispy), resting on a bed of rosemary infused roasted potatoes which were fabulous. The vongole was disappointingly heavy and starchy, with some diners saying they had tasted better ones in their own kitchens. The pizza with spicy sausage was interesting and definitely not done in the traditional Italian taste, while the salted cod with chips and the eggplant were good
4
La Barca's Pizza Salsiccia Piccante and Mozzarella In Carrozza - Italian "French" Toast were really good! The seafood risotto was okay but a little too al dente and dry for me. Do try their coffee as well, it's great! There were mixed reviews on the service standards of La Barca, but we did not observe any problems except maybe when the crowd grew bigger at noon the service staff didn't look so alert.

We were slightly worried about going to La Barca having only read the reviews in the car on the way there. I must say we were pleasantly surprised. The food was very good, service efficient and friendly and the atmosphere very cosy. Restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor is lovely if its a cool evening. On top of that it was not expensive at all. We has 3 starters and 3 mains - total cost for food S$128. We brought our own wine as there is a "no corkage" promotion in Sept 2012. Looked at the wine list and that's good value too.I can understand some comments as about the service. Its not top notch but its certainly good enough for a restaurant priced at these levels. . One thing that we did not like was the fact that a waiter was having dinner at the bar counter as we arrived. He was the same guy we found to have a slight attitude whislt serving. All the other waitresses were very pleasant.We will go back again, for sur

I went with a friend for late lunch.Now, I am not the guy that writes reviews, but this deserves something special.The menu is nothing special, but the prices are INSANE! 20 dollars for an omelette? Are you kidding me?Service is awful... these guys are simply unable to cope with the people asking for the basic stuff, meaning: food.And they get the orders wrong, ALL THE TIME.Other two couple around us, got theirs mixed up or simply wrong.Ours?Well, this friend of mine ordered a risotto with mushrooms and parmigiano (the other choice was risotto with seafood).What do you think they brought out? That's right, seafood, ladies and gentleman. We sent it back, saying that it was not what we had ordered. After 30 seconds, another waiter comes back, pushing the plate in front of my friend's face as if in: this is what you ordered. I looked at him: take it away, she did not order that.In the meantime my omelette had arrived.Omelette with Parmigiano, spinach and FRIES.Now, I thought that the spinach would have been in the omelette, but they were on the side.My bad, but they tasted like... you know what like.The omelette is airplane food, but bad one. What I can say is that the only parmigiano that that omelette saw, must have been in the fridge when the omelette was still unbroken (like in: the eggs should have not been broken to make that omelette... MURDERER!).And the FRIES? Well, very good BAKED potatoes that must have been warmed up directly from the bag just bought at Cold Storage.Now, there's nothing wrong for Mister Michele Sorrentino to want to make a buck (Yes, MISTER, NOT CHEF). But this is just plain WRONG. Mr. Sorrentino, you should be ASHAMED of yourself. You are a disgrace for all the Italian restaurants in the world, abusing the good fame that the Italian cousine has to con (yes, CON) locals and turists alike. You are to blame, for the joke of the service (they wanted us to pay for TWO risotto) and the abysmal quality of food you serve.Shame on you

I went to this restaurant quite hungry... and left feeling hungry, angry and disappointed.The restaurant is nice enough, but hard to find. The staff are keen to help, and are quite good in taking orders, getting drinks etc.The children's meals didn't appear till after the Adults, which is a big NO for a restaurant that claims to cater for kids.The portions are very small and pretty stingy on the good parts ( i.e. meat). The food was tasteless and bland. But when it isn't, the pasta is packed with so much salt you can't eat it. A glass of seawater is more appetising.I ordered the Spaghetti alla carbonara, so small and so salty it was appalling to call this Itallian. I had two bites ( which was about half the serving), and put the plate to the side.even though I was quite hungry. The staff never asked if I had enjoyed the food, even though it was obvious I had a problem.The chef seems to rely on salt as the flavour rather than a flavour enhancement.The sides came after the meals were finsihed, and the kids icecreams never came... although I am sure somehow this poor excuse of a chef would have added salt to the icecream also. So I was happy to pass. My tip.... FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO EAT

We visited La Barca with friends and kids for a weekend brunch. We were initially very impressed with the venue and décor, which is very good indeed. They even have a kids room where the kids can play and be looked after by the staff.The staff however are not that great. As our food arrived, my little two year old spilled a glass of water which flooded the table. The waiting staff wanted to place the food on top of the water and seemed incapable of organising a simple towel to mop up. The food was nothing like you would get in a Michelin star restaurant. It is however cheap and cheerful. Take the apple juice as an example - $4 for a small glass. It is however the reconstituted and full of sugar type. If the restaurant is really trying, it should be fresh pressed. We had four different mains, all of which were judged to be fairly good, but nothing exceptional.As we left, the chef was standing with his hands on his hips with furrowed brow, clearly unhappy with the waiting staff (not to do with us!). Overall we had a nice time. It’s around the corner for us, so we may visit again, but it’s not something we would actively seek out

I have been to La Barca twice... and it is so good. The fish i took each time (different) was perfect. The best i ever had... next table, they ordered beef, it looked so good. This is coming next for me!Value for money is incredible.Ambiance is very good, calm and elaxing.Highly recommended

We went for our anniversary in Nov. Ordered a plate of coldcuts, how difficult can that be? But they did not check and we were served meat that had gone bad! Offered to replace but no thank you. Contemplated canceling pasta and mains but thought they would make an effort to be more careful. No. Pasta was no big deal but for mains, it was seriously bad. My duck was served well done(asked for pink) and it smelled funny, sauce was atrociously terrible, sour and tasteless. My husband sirloin was also overcooked and tasted like it was going off. No thank you to desserts after that. Btw, the restaurant had less than 4 tables that night.. No chance of going back.
