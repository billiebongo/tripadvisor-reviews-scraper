It's not the same and as used and definitely smaller place. The menu shrink as well.. so there isn't much to chose. The duck or they called it the London duck is really good and so does the Xiao long bau..

A nice quiet corner of the busy shopping centre. Fast service, great food.
The meat in the brisket beef was as soft as butter and tasted divine.
Worth a visit when the food court is packed out.

Would recommend the dumplings. Decoration is unique. Round tables are available. Good place to chill with friends and families. They have buffet during weekend.

Five of us went to this restaurant to celebrate Mother's Day on 13 May. We ordered a few dishes with seafood fried rice and noodles. The ambience is quite pleasant as it was a small place. However we find most of the dishes rather salty except for the fried rice and dumpling soup. We prefer the Lao Beijing at Novena Square as the food tasted much better

My friend and I took afternoon leave to LBJ (Plaza Singapura) to feast on our beloved Popiah. This is our 4th visit to LBJ (PS) and we always look forward to the next visit at the same restaurant The popiah ingredients are always very fresh.. a healthy food with 100% vegetables for those who are health conscious. Service is excellent too ! Worth mentioning is server - Anne. She went the extra mile to prepare her 'self-made' wet tissue to let us clean our hands after we finished the popiahs. .. what a wonderful and pleasant dining experience for usWe will definitely return to LBJ (PS) . Well done ! Cheers to Ann

The most memorable part of 'Lao Beijing' is the decor, deliberately echoing venerable mainland China dining establishments from a bygone era. Copious use is made of rosewood, faux teak as well as the plain, sturdy dining tables. As for the food it is an uneven mix: the drunken chicken appetizer is curiously bland, with a processed taste that is without personality or distinctive flavour; french beans fried with minced also barely registers on the taste buds, undermined by a pervasive saltiness which builds up on the palate after each taste, compelling one to order Coke Zero in order to wash it down. Both the seafood hot and sour soup (bursting in bold taste, chock-full with plump shrimp and squid), and the XO fried rice (heartlily filling) stood out, offering a pleasing taste balance. Mention must be made too of the chrysanthemum tea (served without sugar added) which both helped blunt the edges of the less pleasant dishes and nicely complimented the more successful equivalents. Maybe it was either the food's inconsistency or the raucous baying from a nearby table of loud businessmen well into their cups but the final bill seemed hardly worth the experience

Visited the Plaza Singapura outlet last Sunday for lunch. Arrived at 11.40am and no staff was at the entrance to greet/guide customers. Went in and had to call to get a staff's attention. I ordered the zha jiang mein (minced meat noodles) and an order of Jiao zhi (boiled dumplings). The noodles was nicely presented but when I tried to mix it with the sauce, the noodles were stuck together in a lump and it took a lot of effort to mix the meat sauce into the noodles because the sauce was too dry. What surprised me was the noodles was hot which I can only conclude that it was pre-cooked earlier, left to cool in the serving plate and then heated up in a micro-wave before serving. Flavour-wise the noodles was alright. The dumplings came later but several were over cooked with the skin broken. Service was not attentive despite the restaurant only having less than 10 customers. Overall, the food is just passable and the poor service makes this place a disappointment. There are other better options at the same price range

This is a gr8 place for lunch while in the middle of retail therapy.... Good value lunch at $12.80... Choose an appetiser, noodle dish and dumplings (you choose one out of 3 options for each).... More than enough for one person. Pleasant staff, prompt service and nice decor. Not crowded. I shall definitely be back to try the dinner options! Come to think of it, I think I'll go tonight....

One of my family's favourite restaurant.
We love the La Mien, Beijing Duck, Guo Tie. The Fei Cue Toofu is excellent. Price is reasonable. Only aspect they need to improve is there is a charge for plain water.

really good food. I recommend the hot and sour soup and peking duck. But you really can't go wrong here. They have a very extensive menu and everything I tried, I liked.

Pricey but worth it. Love their Beijing duck.

It was a full house on a Friday night but we were lucky as we had reservation. The steamed xiao long baos were superbly cooked and the taste was heavenly. One of the best we had as the broth was delectable, the skin not thick and filling very tasty. We ordered 3 sets for 5 and we still cant get enough of it. We just had to control ourselves from ordering our 4th set as we had ordered a lot of other great tasting from its menu. Service was ok, waitresses typical of any other waitresses when they seem to be very busy most of the time to a point that they forget courtesy. Overall, Lao Beijing was an AAA restaurant, no wonder it has been consistently awarded as one of Singapore's best

Went to this Beijing Cuisine restaurant for lunch with my wife on a Sunday afternoon. Ordered 2 set meal at SGD48 each and the set meal came with Sharkâ€™s Fin Soup, Beijing Duck, Prawn, Fried Fish, Xiao Long Bao (Dumpling) and Desert. Food taste delicious and we thought this is really value for money. However, we had a pleasant surprise when we settled our food bill with my Amex platinum card. We were offered 50% discount for our Amex platinum card. This is certainly more than value for money. We will definitely return for more

Been going there for about 7 years and this last trip last night was disappointing. The xiaolong bao lacked taste and the skin was a bit chewy. The braised beef noodles had too much fat and everything else was pretty much lacklustre as well. Had had rumours that this was the case but I wanted to find out for myself. The rumours were indeed true

Well, I must have to say the dim sum here are really great. I simply like how fresh they are! I especially like the '8 treasures tea' here! Very healthy and taste really good!!!!Siu Long Bao is my favorite dish, it is very juicy and fresh!Tofu in chili tomato sauce also tastes really good! It is best to taste with rice I would definitely come back again!Spending per Head: ard SGD 2

We were looking for something for a very late lunch and chanced upon this really low priced dim sum buffet at just over $10++. It was too cheap to give it a miss! And so we tried for our first time and that's about it. The spread isn't alot to start off and the quality is not good. The sesame paste dessert tasted like too much water has been added. The char siew pau was one of the more better dish served but be warned it can be gone too soon. The dumplings which are to be ordered (not served on the buffet table) are passable. Its just that they are served in little teacups if you order 1-2 pcs only. But what can I say, it doesn't burn a hole in one's pocket and yet you get to while your afternoon away in an air-conditioned restaurant. Not that bad lah.. ;
