Love the smell of the coffee aroma. The kaya is very nice. Price is reasonable and quite adequate number of seats.

This is the place we come for coffee after a meal in Fortune Center (e.g. after a meal at the Japanese Curry Express). But it is a small shop, so sometimes it is hard to get a seat.

Came back here again yesterday for some tea after lunch in the Fortune Centre. A bit of a queue to be served but no issues getting a table at around 1.30pm. Tea was pretty much the same as anywhere else.

A good place to have your morning breakfast with local coffee. Beats overpriced Starbucks many times over. Staff here are friendly and will see to your needs. Tourists who want to have a feel of the local life should give this a try.

Popular little local cafe in the Fortune Centre. Stopped here for some tea and toast after lunch at one of the vegetarian specialty places in the same building. Friendly service but a bit slow today due to being busy.

Came here for the usual tea and kaya toast after lunch at Herbivore in Fortune Centre. Decent atmosphere and fairly busy, but still able to get a table. Tea and kaya toast were both quite good.

I have been to Four Seasons Cafe numerous times, as I used to volunteer close by. I am always happy with kaya toast and I always order Teh C, my favorite drink. I find it most tasty kaya toast so far. They also have sweet hot dessert soups, like ginkgo nut or red bean, every day some different. I tried that too- delicious
