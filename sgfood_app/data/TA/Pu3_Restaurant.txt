I was here with my colleagues for lunch and boy did we have a feast! We ordered their full platter to share amongst a group of 6 persons and we were so full after attempting to finish everything! It was our first time trying Nasi Ambeng and it was a great decision to go old-school and authentic. No regrets! The ambiance could use some spring cleaning and newer deco. The food was delicious and the experience is certainly memorable. But it fell short on feeling comfortable and clean. Room for improvement nonetheless

When to Pu3 on our first nite in Singapore. Got to know the place by Googling it for any halal restaurant. The food was delicious. Place is clean and staffs are friendly. We tried Nasi Ambeng serve in a dulang that caters to 4 pax. They do also cater for 2 pax. There were around 5-6 different type of food. The food was really that delicious. We will definitely go here again.

Had slightly early lunch before lunch crowd streamed in. Happy that we did that as we can choose the dishes leisurely without pressure from the queue. Since only two of us, we skipped the well known Nasi Ambeng and opt for a la carte which is good also as we can choose dishes that we like. It was my first visit by the way and heard about this place from food bloggers. We did over order and pack the dried stuff back. Also could not resist to dabao (take away) ondeh ondeh and kueh dadar for tea break. I must stress that the rice was particular soft and fragrant which is rare. Does make the whole meal satisfying being a rice person myself. Service was good and overall a hearty meal. Definitely would be back again. Setting was good and it is air conned. No strong oily smell which I fear most. Business was good as I saw ready packed lunches for collection

We visited this restaurant as we were visiting the nearby mosque. The colorful display of tempeh goreng, gulai (curry)and herbs drew me into it. As I entered the restaurant the aromatic smell of the fried chicken confirmed my needs to have lunch here. My take for the day- half Jasmeen rice, herbs, sambal belacan (chili with shrimp paste), friend chicken and fried taufo. The finale is to add spoonfuls of all the gulai- lemak( coconut based), chili and soya sauce based. Gosh it was a truly satisfying experience.

I have been celebrating my birthday lunch over nasi Padang. This came recommended for their nasi ambeng. We didn't order that and decide to go for their rawang, grill fish, paru, samba Goreng, sayur lodeh. Their highlight is Tahu telur, we went for second helping. Will definitely try to come back again

We ordered an Ambeng Dulang for 2 person, and portion was really big - it fed my party of 3 very very well! The variety of dishes was very good and tasty. The entire set was $29.90, which is really good value. Yummy!!

Tasty and good Javanese food to share. Nasi Ambeng to die for but my favorite iis the Lemak fish. Melts in your mouth.

Come here for a quick lunch. Order mixed rice (beef, tempe and vegetables). Beef quite tender and the other dishes taste nice. I also order fried banana. Together with drinks our order cost less than $15 (for 2 persons).

This is my 3rd time visiting this restaurant and the food is still as tasty as always. This place is like a hidden gemstone in the middle of a busy city area! The volume of patrons is under-rated given the delicious food and affordable price.Just some intro on Pu3’s– (pronounced as Puteri’s), they are famous for traditional Malay / Indonesian food known as “Nasi Padang” a serving consisting of white steamed rice served with various choices of pre-cooked dishes.You can see the variety of dishes on display, the moment you entered the restaurant accompanied with the aroma of spices. There are a few ways on how you can choose to order your favourite Nasi Padang:1) At the counter, patrons can request for an ‘ala-carte’ serving of their nasi padang, where a plate of steamed white rice will be served followed by you pointing at whichever dishes that attracts your eyes. The price will vary according to the number of dishes that you picked. Once done, you can order your drinks and make payment before consuming your own masterpiece.2) Alternatively, if you do not wish to choose your dishes – you can have the Nasi Ambeng set meal (Highly recommended). Proceed to find a seat and place your order with the waiter, for a ‘Nasi Ambeng’ for 1 pax. This is priced at SGD $7.50 regardless of whether you choose to have chicken or mutton/beef as the choice of meat, excluding any drinks that you might order. Make your payment after that and the food and drinks will serve to you wherever you chose to sit in the restaurant. The set meal comes with a pre-fix of 5-6 dishes.3) If you are coming with a group of friends and wish to have more varieties of dishes, then you can order ‘Nasi Ambeng Dulang’. Dulang which literally means tray, is a giant platter that is used to serve about 2-6 pax, price at SGD $29.90 and above! Similar to ‘Nasi Ambeng set meal’, where steamed rice will be served with pre-fix dishes, but Dulang will have more dishes on it without having to choose meat or chicken, and a much bigger portion of steamed white rice. A translation on the name of the dishes served:Begedil – deep fried rounded mash potatoesNasi putih – steam white riceAyam/Lembu/kambing – chicken/beef/muttonRendang – A gravy similar to curry but a drier version, usually either beef or mutton. Sometimes chicken too. Sambal Goreng – long bean vegetable with chilli, mini-beancurd and fry fermented soya beansTerung – brinjal/egg plants serve with chiliParu – fried beef lungsUrap Kencur – mix vegetable of bean sprout with coconutSerunding – sweet grated coconut Sambal – condiments of blended chili, bird’s eye chili, onion etc (extra spicy level)Overall, most of the dishes have a mild spicy level. If you think it is not spicy enough for you, then you can request to have more Sambal.It is always better to call for a reservation if you have a big group visiting this place

Known for its Nasi Ambeng. Nasi Ambeng is very much like Nasi Padang except most of the dishes are pre-selected. You can either have a choice of chicken or beef for your main meat dish.The idea of communal eating is fun! You can have a choice of individual serving or to be shared with family and friends in a large 'dulang' (tray).It's a great way to bond and share with family and friends, a dying tradition. Not a lot of places serve it anymore, so do give it a try. I love the beef rendang, serunding (coconut floss) and tempeh (fermented soy bean in a cake form). I heard great reviews of the bergedil (potato patty) but am disappointed that it's lacking 'spice'. It tasted pretty much like ordinary potato mash into a patty :(Nevertheless, an enjoyable meal and experience that satisfy my cravings for Malay foo

6 of us came here for lunch and ordered a big portion of Ambeng Dulang. Wow, the food was yummy, the portion was huge - enough for 7, the price was good value for money. Ordered additional portion of assam stingray, and that was the star. Overall, it was a great lunching experience

I am a fan of Nasi Padang. This place is really worth going with friends and you can share the dulang (tray) of nasi padang which is very tasty and worth the money.Book in advance to secure a seat as this place is very popular

Group of 10 adults and 2 kids. Orders 2 Nasi Ambeng, each one for 4 pax but actually it is enough for 6. There is also Nasi Ambeng for 2 pax. Everyone eats from the big plate. Has everything in it. We came during the Ramadan month. Though restaurant was packed, service was good and orderly. Will definitely come back again.

1 thing for sure, price suits the amount of dishes and portions served. Lemme give you a tip though, come on an empty stomach!! The food is sooooo good that i regret eating smth light before lunch over at the restaurant.. For 2 person meal, its more to a 3-4.. So if 3-4person meal, able to served about 6-7 people to eat. Yes, their portion is generous, thats what i like the most. Its more to worth ur every dollar and cents. The flaw i had is that, i wish i live nearer so that each time i have ambeng craving, i can just dropby and do takeaway. So basically, no flaws by me personally. Can say i enter with an open stomach and go back with a very very full stomach and a smiley face and sleepy eyes! I dont need to say more, just for you to experience the fullness, greatness, the-VERYFILLING meal i had there. Thanks Pu3 Restaurant for making this girl so full that she wanna dine in again soon!!!

The Nasi Ambeng served is one of the best that i have ate . it's never enough but its filling your because the idea of eating together is one of the best idea. Order their Jug of Bandung or Ice Lemon Tea. Worth the money. Do call them to ask of the reservations. but do come earlier than 8pm cause by then the dishes almost finishing . If Ramadan, Please call to make reservations to avoid disappointment. Very Convenient . Carpark and Mosque nearby
