Should try !
i like it very much and the prawns are fresh and big!
The soup is delicious too
It's little oily but it comes from the chili i think.

Went to try because saw lot of people queuing. Cheapest is $4 which came with two medium size prawns sliced in half. The soup base is not very thick despite the color is reddish. Saw other customers also did not finish their soup and left them on the table. It's up to individual's preference

Have been wanting to try this place for several yrs already but never really got around to it. Finally had it for dinner before Ed Sheeran concertI ordered the most ex bowl which gives u their largest prawns but noodle portion is still suited for 1 person ( felt they could give a little more noodle)I took the dry version. The Noodles are pretty tasty and the soup very “prawny” flavour almost like a prawn bisque. One thing I felt that was missing is giving chilli powder option to add. I tried some prawn noodle around Bishan area and that shop u can add ur own chili powder which adds a new dimension to the broth

NEVER to be missed dish once you step foot into the Food Centre. The aroma will simply attract you to the stall even you think you are not going to eat in this stall. Eventually your previous money will be deposited into this Big Prawn Noodle stalls. Sometimes you need to wait longer than usual because all the prawns are freshly cooked. The soup will make you quest for more and more until your stomach make sure that you are 100% satisfied
