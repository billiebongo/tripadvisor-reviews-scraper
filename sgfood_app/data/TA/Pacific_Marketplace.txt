I recommend the Nyonya Chicken Curry and the Duck Curry with Pineapple. Have some Chilean red or white with these dishes. Happiness guaranteed. :)

We wanted a quick dinner meal. But most places were targeted to coffee and sweets. There was a Japanese section off to one side on an upper floor. It would have been much better than the food-to go place we chose. Yes our mistake!!

First visit earlier this year.
Loved the pastry. Mixed berries/
Will be back to try others, eg. sandwiches.
the only minus...had to wait for service.
No one was behind the counter at the Patisserie section.

We sampled as many different foods types in Singapore from western to Asian food and the variety was amazingly enjoyable. There was no particular restaurant that stood out, we just enjoyed the whole experience.

The coffee at this place is great! The seats are comfortable and is a great place for a relaxation or even for a business meeting.

Bah kut teh here is one of the closest you can get to Malaysian style bak kut teh. The random ingredients in the soup makes the experience non Singapore dish. Its one of the better ones i can get fot herbal taste.The charcoal waffle is simply fabulous. Savory and delightful in every single bite. There's even a tiny bit of tuffle that brings out the whole flavour of the savoury meal

My husband and I were there for dinner and there was only one other customer. The atmosphere was pleasant and quiet. The waiter was very polite. We ordered 2 dishes which were not available to our dismay but with the politeness of the waiter, we gladly ordered something else. Food tasted really good and we were well-served.

There are many places to eat breakfast in Singapore, but while staying at the Pan Pacific Singapore we decide to eat at the Pacific Marketplace which is within the hotel itself and while having breakfast work out our daily routine for looking around Singapore. Great variety, great tasty foods, great coffee, and fantastic service from the staff. Prices were pretty reasonable also. Thanks, complements to all the staff involved especially KAVI, a great staff member who knew our every need within a couple of days, and always with a great smile and personality. 10/10

Visit pacific market for quick lunch, enjoy their lobster laksa so much, staff very friendly and helpful. Give proper advise towards food selection and provide excellent service. The staff tried her best to fulfilled my needs even thought she struggling to attend other customers as she was alone. Kudos to mila

As we were staying in the Pan Pacific, this was convenient for food one evening.There is a limited menu but everything is cooked fresh to order from an open kitchen. This mini sliders were very good!Service was very prompt and extremely friendly. I'd eat here again if I didn't want to leave the hotel
