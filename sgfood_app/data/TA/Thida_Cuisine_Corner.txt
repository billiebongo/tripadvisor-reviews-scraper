Came by on a Sat night and decided to give this place a try seeing it's almost full. We ordered omelette with rice, fried chicken wings and fried noodles (which is actually kway teow). Can't go wrong with Omelette but I feel it could have been fluffier. The chicken wings are basically wing tips (not mid joints nor drumlets) plus some small chopped up parts; whilst they taste good, similar to our zichar prawn paste chicken, I wouldn't order again cos there isn't much meat. The fried noodles were good, had the wok hei but v v spicy, so I'd ask for a less spicy version next time. They have lots of items on the menu which i haven't tried, seen other tables having som tam, steamed fish and soup items, so I'd likely come back to try other dishes since this place doesn't charge service nor GST

I often visit Golden Mile which is adjacent to my Beach Road neighborhood in Singapore, to experience the variety of Thai restaurants available.My favorite is Thida Cuisine Corner because the chefs are passionate about their cooking and the enjoyment of their cuisine by their customers.I especially appreciate the simplicity of the decor which feels like I have been invited into the veranda of a home.The menu is creative and helpful with pictures and English language, however; the chefs welcome special requests of their menu selections.I often as the female chef to surprise me; one of her specialties is Thai white ocean fish, fried with a light, crisp batter of Thai spices. This is an excellent dish for two to share and you will not want to stop enjoying the savory flavors of dish

I have visited this humble restaurant at Golden Mile Complex at least 10 times while working at an office nearby. The food and drinks here are consistently good. As a Thai food lover, I feel that this is one of the best food places to eat in Golden Mile or in Singapore

A thai friend introduced us to this place for what she considers authentic thai food in singapore. Its now become our favourite (and only) Thai eatery. The steamed fish, tomyum soup and somtum are amazing! Makes me wish i lived in golden mile just so i could eat 3 meals out of this place everyday

The Tom Yam fried rice is a must try. We actually travel almost 30km from north just to eat this. No regret. We had the tong ka gai(thai herb spicy chicken soup with coconut milk). Not very strong coconut milk so it wasn't too creamy. it is refreshing and tasty. Pad Thai is so-so. the fried chicken wing with herbs don't bother to order.The place is small, only has 4 tables really inside the restaurant. The rest of the tables actually at the outside and you can expect some human traffic while you eat. we kindly of like it sitting outside cos there is really some nostalgic feel. The price is on the low side
