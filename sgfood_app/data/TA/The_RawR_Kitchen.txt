Service is great to start with, a cozy place with awesome food and drinks at awesome price.Food menu is limited though, but fine for us, as the main catch was the BEER!!! Ask for a set of sampler and you get to enjoy more of your drinks, as they offer more than 10 different selection all fresh from tap. Great for adventurous drinker =

This non-descript diner surprised us with its well-crafted beers (on site) and tasty, wholesome food - all at reasonable prices. Yes, it was not the easiest venue to locate but we are glad we persisted. Dinner started with clams in white wine, followed by mains of grilled pork chops and pasta bolognese. The clams went well with the icy chilled Pilsner and the tasty stout paired well with the pork chops. The star dish was the bolognese. It was rich without being cloying. The tomato element was present but not overpowering. The staff were more than happy to recommend the best beers that would go with your food. We'll definitely be back for their beer and the best bolognese

Has a pub like feel. Enjoyed the deep fried pork belly, soft inside and crisp outside. The spaghetti bolognese is meaty and rich, and loved the mushrooms and curry like sauce. Portions are generous. Easiest to get to by car. A little difficult to locate but we'll worth the effort. Do it! We've been twice, to date.
