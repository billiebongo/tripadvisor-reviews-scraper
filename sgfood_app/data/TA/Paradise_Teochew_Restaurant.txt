Private room required minimum spend of $600/ only. 3rd floor Scotts Square. Attentive staff. Serves porridge as well. Authentic Teochew cuisine. Well arranged comfortable table for 12. 3 private rooms available.

Ordered porridge and dim sum. Indeed the staff tried their best to serve us but the miscommunication during peak hour seems like a norm.
5
Place is nice, crowded, good place to have good food and meet up with friends.
The porridge is nice and must try!
Tim sum is superb too.
3
Had the braised duck, oyster omelette, satay beef and fish which was on offer. Food was ok, albeit a little oily
4
We , four of us ,ordered five dishes, namely, stewed duck with yam; sweet and sour pork; fried baby kailan; salted fish with pork and soup and dessert was crispy sweet potato/yam/pumkin ; the food portion is a bit small but all taste good . Recommended if you like typical teochew chinese food
4
Pleasant decor and good space between the tables. On the whole the food which is not solely teochew dishes had been well prepared. The suckling pig was particularly flavoursome.Even though the restaurant was not full the service at times was a little on the slow side.Expect to pay about S$100 per head based on five to six dishes
4
Quite a good combination to have traditional dim sum (cantonese) plus xiao long pau and teochew porridge. Had the minced pork porridge and was pleased to have such a big portion for the price it cost. As was just lunch so didn't try other teochew dishes. The signature piglet pau was good The prices for dim sum were higher than other dim sum restaurants. Also the incidental charges for tea and peanuts are high
4
The food is tasty although there are a lot of non-teochew dishes on the menu. The cold crab and cold platter were great, fresh ingredients executed well. We thought the oyster omelette and the fresh prawns were also worth ordering. Expect to pay about $100 per person for a meal. They tend to cram in the seatings so don't be surprised if the staff try to push you to finish your meal to make space for the next group.
4
This is not a cheap restaurant but the food is good and the service is good too. If you like to try Teochew food in Singapore this is a good place to start with. On the average prepare to pay US$60 per person for a decent meal
5
The food here is good. There are many traditional Teochew favourites such as steamed promfret fish, braised duck, oyster eggs, and cold crabs.
4
Excellent Teochew food like pomfret porridge, mustard green in crab meat, braised Croacker fish were delicious
4
Overall food quality is not bad, however, to be frank, the price is very expensive. Once a while I think is okay.
4
Love the teochew food, well executed and flavorful dishes. This is my 2nd visit and I would try the dim sum next time
5
The waitress is very professional, giving recommendation on food and attentive to us. Although their duck is famous but I prefer others. Dessert is yummy!
4
The food was generally good. We had braised duck, cereal prawns and some other dishes. Service was ok except that we had to keep asking for champagne glasses, before they finally brought them.
4
We loved the cold crab and five spice meat rolls. The pomfret porridge was simply to die for! And we also had a traditional dessert which looked like a pizza with shredded yam and pumpkin and this was awesome too!
5
Restaurants belonging to Paradise group always serve delicious food and this was no exception.This place tends to crowded in the weekends and so I'm glad that we went on a weekday evening.The usual Teochew cuisine are creatively executed and we didn't find any that we didn't like

We decided to check out Paradise Teochew as our overseas guests loved to have Teochew cuisine. The friendly GRO ushered us to our reserved room upon arrival. The room was not extensive decorated but well enough. The main dining has an open rectangular layout. Ambience is OK but not a fine dining category.We pre-ordered two dishes, Flower Crab & Braised Goose Liver. The Cold Flower crabs served was fresh and tasty but disappointedly SMALL. Mush smaller than those found in the local wet market. Actually, the crabs were too small to be served in such restaurant. The next reserved dish was the Braised Goose Liver with Duck wings combo. The portion of goose liver was quite substantial that 4 of us could not finish it. Though it was tasty but it certainly lack the right smoothness texture. It missed the tofu soft texture but enough firm bite and yet melt in your mouth. We had tasted such liver greatness at a joint at ION. The other dishes recommended by the Captain Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Grouper cooked in Teochew style, 3 kinds of prawn roll, Teochew Shark fins and Fried Kway Teow. Fish was fresh and tender with a thick tasty broth. The prawn rolls was equally tasty with different type of fillings. The Shark fins broth tasted similar to that of Thai Shark fin without beans sprout. The fried kway teow with radish was a complete let down as the cook used the thin version. It was cooked like an ordinary fried kway teow.Overall, it was a good experience dining here. Service was good but improvement needed on the certain Teochew dishes.

The braised Irish duck was decadently delicious with juicy flesh and just the right amount of fragrant fat and the cold crab was chilled just right the flesh firm asweet and the roe n the shell heavenly. But There was far too much cornflour in the tofu dishes and the pomegranate chicken which I expected to be deep fried parcels came out steamed and drowned in a gluey gob! The tofu too was covered in the same starchy sauce as was the vegetarian bamboo pith. The fried Mee Sua was far too greasy and not @ all what u expect from a Teochew Restaurant. When a customer chooses to dine at a Teochew restaurant they expect light mildly flavoured but fresh tasting dishes ingredients. These were but it. Or Nee was - that was a good finish. But overall overpriced although the pronotiinal $18 cold crab was good value.

We went for lunch on national day. The food wasn't nice. They took very long to serve the food. Keep servicing wrong dish to us. The price is expensive for the food and service given.
4
The services and food was wonderful, especially the roast suckling pig, dessert was my favor. Appetizer (cold food) was also nice, fried fish really soft and taste.
5
My group of friends have been celebrating our birthdays here for the last 1 year as we love the cold crabs served ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹and the not-too-noisy place that's great for chit chatting the night away!
5
Restaurant was very packed during sunday lunch, but the food was still served within short waiting time and taste was superb!
5
I would like to thank the staff, Miss Faye who assisted me in ordering food and the restaurant, which very accommodating for my diet restriction (multi allergy). I'm grateful!
5
Slightly expensive but quality of food definitely superior to the usual teochew porridge places. Would go again!
4
Service staff was friendly and the food was well prepared. Was surprised that it wasn't too crowded on a Friday night.
5
Dimsum was wonderful and my favorite dish Peking duck was a delight with its paper thin pancakes. Shrimp in salted egg and the beef was soooo tender. I love this restaurant and will visit it every time I am in Singapore.
4
We tried: goose and meats combo, roast suckling pig, deep fried fish, bean sprouts in salted fish, chicken broth, noodles, or-ngee yam. Mostly teochew favourites and the food tasted delicious and servings were just right. Staff was friendly and attentive.It was my first visit and was not disappointed

We were going around trying out restaurants offering Teochew cuisine to decide on one for my mother-in-law's 80th birthday bash later this year. When we came here, we really liked the place and its food. Not a big restaurant and quite cozy, with friendly staff.We loved the cold crab and five spice meat rolls. The pomfret porridge was simply to die for! And we also had a traditional dessert which looked like a pizza with shredded yam and pumpkin and this was awesome too!
5
Good location, good food. Most importantly we had a wonderful time and received wonderful service from the crew there. They even sang us a Mother's Day song and gave my mom scarfs as gifts!
5
Really fresh and tasty dim sum! Best Teochew promfret porridge and braised duck! And the staff were polite and attentive!
5
My family and I had a wonderful time. The staff were attentive and helpful, and I must add that everyone enjoyed the tasty food very much. The space was a little small though.
4
Authentic food grea ambience. Service was attentive and speedy. Overall a good experience. Slightly pricey.
4
Delicious food and decent price but oyster in congee is a bit smell. For appetizer, cold crab is fresh and roe is really tasty.
4
Went to the restaurant for dim sum but surprisingly, the teochew porridge dishes were a lot better than the dim sum!
2
The food was so mediocre. The oyster omelette though fried quite nicely had about 5 little oysters....The Teochew pork and prawn rolls weren't very tasty. The cold crab was overcooked and not very fragrant nor sweet. I wouldn't go back.
5
Great and unique dishes. Seafood was fresh. Serving drinks was a bit slow. Servers need to smile more :)
4
You can't go wrong with Paradise....it's good standard Teochew cuisine. Braised duck was very tender flavourful. Steamed pomfret almost perfect except the price! Presentation was almost non-existent though, almost like Zhichar standard! For that price you expect a bit more. Service was v good . Can go again as good Teochew food is becoming scarce nowadays..
4
This restaurant is elegant and spacious, with a good standard of cooking - but strangely, the staff appeared very stressed instead of exuding warm hospitality. They were rushing around but had no personal interest in their customers. We enjoyed the Beef Short Ribs, and their fried mee Sua was very good, with lots of ingredients and wok hei. The hor fun with sweet chai por was well done too
5
Happy to have another teochew restaurant of good quality. There is a lack of hokkien and teochew places in the local food scene. main style is no doubt cantonese. paradise teochew does the teochew basics well and I am happy for that.
4
Had a Pleasant Dining Experience @ Paradise Teochew Restaurant, Scotts Square branch.
Having recently had a meal there, will be back soon for more.
4
The dishes were delicately created. Wide variety of teochew fare. My friend and I were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dim sum. The chef obviously spent time making these drlicious offerings!
4
The food and service here are really good and come here often for the Teochew specialties. Love the oyster omelet, the roast pork, dim sum, etc. Have always had a very satisfying and enjoyable time and look forward to coming back.

Food was ok but definitely overpriced!!! Was there for company early Chinese New Year dinner with my staff. The set was $500++ for 5 pax. Expected to have good food with that kind of price, more so when it was only on Feb 17, a little early to celebrate. Food was just ok but it was not satisfying. Definitely made me feel like this will be the first and definitely the last. Restaurants like these should have given more for customers like us who will be regular customers if we are happy. Since then, I had some other dinners at other restaurants half a dozen more times celebrating CNY! Never recommend anyone else to go there and don't intend to return again

Our party of 6 ladies had a Chinese New Year dinner here a few nights ago. The Lo Hei (raw fish salad) was one of the best I've eaten, with its crunchy julienned yam and pumpkin seeds. They added a crunch to the raw salad which was more savoury than sweet. Perfect. The restaurant even gets their servers to recite auspicious Chinese rhymes prior to preparing the raw fish salad. We ordered the set menu for 4 persons (raw fish salad, shark bone soup, steamed fish, braised sea cucumber and abalone on lettuce, glutinous rice, yam paste dessert) and supplemented with the deep fried prawn paste balls, roast duck and long beans. The shark bone soup was creamy with collagen and delicately seasoned. Loved the roast duck which was savoury fatty and moist. It was a shame we didn't have any more room for the suckling pig (which needs 2 days' advanced notice), which I hear is one of the best in town. The waitstaff were all extremely friendly and attentive, and really added to the dining experience, as good service is harder to come by in Singapore. They even accommodated our request to omit black pepper from all the dishes as one of our party was allergic to it. I would love to go back to try the other dishes on the menu like the suckling pig and cold crab

Being a Teochew, we always love trying out new Teochew Restaurant. Paradise offers the best suckling pig I have tried so far as compared to other Restaurants. The steam promfret and Omelette egg were very delicious too. They have very attentive and courteous staff who ensure you are satisfied with the quality of food. Ambience is high end and is a perfect place to host special guest

Great Dimsum for lunches. But being a big eater, my family of 8 pre ordered a whole roasted suckling pig that was enjoyed to the very last bite. Also enjoyed memorably the fat duck that was soyed and had to dip or best enjoyed with vinegar and chilli. Service for Christmas Day lunch was made memorable as the staff made great effort to welcome us with spotless service. I sincerely would recommend this place if looking for the best soyed goose and suckling pig experience
4
Its a high end Teochew restaurant with modern settings. Besides the expensive dishes, the restaurant does offer more affordable dishes albeit in smaller portions compared to other restaurants. We like the taste and quality of the food and wouldn't mind paying more to dine here. Service staff are very friendly.

Visited Paradise Teochew Restaurant located at Level 3 of Scotts Square along Scotts Road. Advance order the cold crab and crispy suckling pig to avoid disappointment. Both dishes were highlights of today's lunch. Really tasty. Other dishes included dim sum, oyster porridge and fried noodle pancake. Oyster porridge was delicious too. Enjoyed this lunch very much. Estimated $600 for 9 persons
