Great baguettes, fresh ingredients, good detox juice too. A bit expensive, thought. You end up spending more than 15 SGD in those two items.

Paris Baguette Cafe, a good baguette cafe! Choices of different baguette fillings are available. Good job in having good baguette for consumers.

Club sandwich is well worth a try, very fresh. Coffee is good, tried both cappuccino and latte. Reasonable amount of seating.

Cafe is nice and fairly quiet to chill in crazily crowded Bugis. We stood in the queue but non of the staffs wanted to take our order, they even served customers behind us first!! Only when I called one of them to finally get their attention to take the food for me then they willing to do it. My tray of food was then placed at the back (behind the others in the queue when IM INFRONT OF THEM LOL). So I assumed they will move it forward as I continued queueing in line. But NO. They saw me without a tray at the front then they signaled for the customer behind me to go ahead first to pay seriously?! The second cashier wanted to do the same but I went to her and told her my tray was placed at the back by her staff. Only then she unwilling serve me, no apologies given.Wrap was pretty good, filing is generous. Almond pastry was affordable too for the huge portion but too buttery and oily at the bottom of the pastry. Honey frappe was light, mildly sweet with honey, quite refreshing. Food is above average I would say but perhaps the service can be improve.
