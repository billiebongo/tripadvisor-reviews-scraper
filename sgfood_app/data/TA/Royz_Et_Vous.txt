This restaurant serves good mains and it is usually crowded. Located at telok ayer it is a convenient place and easy access by MRT. Ambience in the restaurant is good and therefore would recommend this restaurant to couples.

A birthday dinner gathering with a group of friends. Though it’s a halal cafe and find the food really awesome for the pricing. We had a real feast with 10 different orders ranging from starters to main course. Cafe is just opposite the famous Tian Hock Kheng Temple and easy to locate.Will return again and try more selections ^

The sign said specialty coffee which we couldn’t resist after a nice lunch at another eatery. We weren’t disappointed- Enjoyed piccolo latte, vanilla latte and a rich hot chocolate. And an unexpected treat when we saw and ordered a slice of onde onde cake. A delicious creation with layered pandan sponge cake with gula melaka and cream filling and shredded coconut topping - Delicious!! Service was accommodating and friendly.

It was lunch on a Friday with my work colleagues. We are a group of 7 pax, thus, we made reservation before hand.Ambiance - nice and cozy but it tends to be quite crowded and noisy during lunch hour.I have been in this restaurant twice, and coincidentally, we always seated at the same place.Food - we love it! Its a halal and a vegetarian-friendly restaurant. Portion is considerably big. During my first time - I tried the fish & chips and literally I cannot finish it. Second time, I tried the wagyu beef burger and its really superb! Their fried mushroom - appetizer, is a must try! Desserts and pasta are also nice. Just let the staff know your preference - no onion, no garlic and the like - and they will definitely do it for you.Cost - worth it!Staff - they are very polite and accommodating.In general, its a must try restaurant

This restaurant located at Telok Ayer Street, right opposite the Thian Hock Keng Temple incase you miss it.We had a great dinner at there.Each food presentation and taste did not disappoint us at all. Their steaks and salmon were cooked exactly to our preference. And they have halal free alcoholic / non-alcoholic wine. We went there on a Saturday Night and there wasn't much crowd due to the cold rainy weather.Staffs service were friendly and polite. We were a big family hence, the big order. But the waiter able to take our orders down with ease. The price is worth it and the standards of their menu did not disappoint us at all.Do drop by the restaurant if any of you are in the area.

This restaurant is a cafe that serves halal food with a great ambience. They have starters, salads, brunch, mains, and dessert, alongside a wide range of beverages. Food is good, servings are huge, a little pricier compared to other places but worth it. Best to come here with friends for sharing dishes

We had fish and chips, salmon, prawn and crayfish pasta, grilled chicken and the mango salad. My pasta was creamy and delicious with the spicy kick from the chili padi which I love. The fish and chips were a good portion. But the rest of what we ordered was a disappointment. Mango salad dressing too sweet. Grilled chicken was too sweet. Salmon was overcooked and dry.What I love is that this is a halal eatery. Think it's time Singapore has better halal options. But this did not cut it for me. The ambience is ok. Girly cum industrial chic. Wish it could make up its mind. Food was average. Overall experience: once is enough.

(Telok Ayer Outlet)Went there with a party of 6 pax. Because its Iftar, we have called to pre-order to avoid delay..Restaurant was not crowded, 2 of my burgers got delayed when the rest have finished half of their food. BBQ ribs was good but too much fats, have tasted better elsewhere. Overall main course came quite big portion so sharing is recommended escept for their pasta which is quite small.They missed out our 2x soup of the day but we were charged and was quickly voided after we informed them. The cleanliness of their washroom need to be improved. Once you open the door the stench was unbearable. Service staff were nice and friendly
4
It was a gathering for a group of 18 pax. The cafe is spacious enough for group gathering and to allow prompt delivery of food to the guest, big group reservation are allowed to pre-order their food in advance. The Chilli Beef fries is a must try as it is a good dish for sharing. I had the seafood aglio pasta. It is not too dry not too oily for an oglio pasta. Cosy cafe for a gatherin
5
A decent experience on our first visit to this branch at Chai Chee (opposite Decathlon). Service was good. So we’ll definitely return for more in near future. Highly recommended.Food: Sweet Potato Fries, Beef Short Ribs, Wagyu Beef Burger. An excellent sumptuous feast, generous portions, creative, fresh ingredients, very nicely done. Good for sharing.Environment: Relaxed ambience, spacious, good for large group gatherings/ celebrations
4
Love the place. Good customer service & friendly people. Cosy place. Great for family and casual outing. The food is good portion.
5
Big portion comes at reasonable price. The ones I tried tasted all good. There is another outlet at Chai Chee/Bedok.
French cuisine with a twist of Malay taste.
Serves Halal food.
5
Had a birthday celebration for my daughter. Restaurant able to cater our request for 25 pax. Simple decoration done. The meal was fantastic. The beef short ribs was quite tasty. Everyone enjoy the great time together. Staffs were very friendly.
3
I ate here with my team for lunch. The portion sizes were quite large and service was pretty fast given the large number of people. I tried the chicken lunch which has quite a sweet sauce. The food was average but not bad.
5
The food is great. I went twice to the Telok Ayer outlet. Even my boss liked the place. Friendly staff. Easy online reservation. I would suggest to reserve a table if not you will have to wait for one. Non-stop customers both lunch time and dinner time. Caramel Black Tea is the best to me!
2
I made a reservation for 4 and indicated on the booking that we were celebrating my mom's birthday on the remark. I was not expecting any birthday song or free cake sort of treatment and was disappointed enough that there wasn't even a simple birthday wish extended. Service staff attitude was quite cold. I must say that their job is merely taking order and delivery food to the table. No food recommendation was given. Even failed to listen to our request to have all orders be served together. Food was average. Only their short ribs is worth a return visit. Restaurant ambience was very noisy. While I can't truly fault the Management, the place is just too noisy with people talking and laughing very loudly without being considerate to people at the next table; the most turn-off factor for me. My visit was on a weekday night at 8pm.
5
Ordered 2 marvellous starters of sweet potato & buffalo wings which all 4 of us agreed was wonderful. 4 varieties of main course and everything was absolutely delicious. Portions were great, price were affordable, restaurant is clean, friendly staff, food served in a timely manner and even the desserts and cakes are just too fingerlicious. We had ondeh ondeh cake.If u are looking for a once in a month splurge for great meat, come down here, you won't be disappointed. Ordered: Herb Crusted Salmon, Smoked Duck, Brazen Beef & Beef Short Rib
5
Initially made an online reservation only to find out that it was not valid and no confirmation received. However, despite full occupancy, the very kind manager was able to gather his team to arrange the a few chairs to accommodate me and my group of friends. Service was pretty on-time for most of it. And food was scrumptious. Thak you Royz et Vous for the wonderful evening
5
its my 2nd time to visit this place ... its another farewell dinner for a colleague .. the smoked duck is superb and the beef short ribs is highly recommended as usual... the sweet potato fries i can never stop eating ... visit this place you guys!!

The concept and deco of the restaurant is great. The location fits nicely too, although you may argue that carpark space can be scarce depending on your visit time.My wife ordered truffle mushrooms for our starters and it was excellent, 10/10. If you love fried mushrooms and truffle oil, this is the best combination you will ever try.Unfortunately, our entrees weren't spectacular. My order of chicken was pleasantly presented; however, it was the same slim slab of meat you get when you buy a typical chicken chop set from any local Western stall in a food court. It also did just average in the taste test. I think it is worth half the price I paid for it. My wife's pasta was also under par, being pretty bland. The thing that requires an urgent fix is their service standards - it was shocking, really. I will return if the service is good
5
I tried their Wagyu beef burger and its taste tremendously delicious. the beef is fresh and juicy..worth every penny that you spend.
5
Variety of halal meal and even drink choices, tasty food, great beverages, splendid ambience, warm service staff and convenient location
5
Had one of the best steak and quite impressed by it. Request for medium raw and happy about it. Comes in good portion as well. Service can improved a little but overall had a great experience. Will recommend for those looking for Halal eateries.
4
Favs in the menu - smoked duck. Delicious and a big portion is served. Can be shared by 2 people. Service was great. The prices was a bit steep though.
5
Just got back from their outlet in Chai Chee & I must say, it is just as good as the Telok Ayer one, if not better! I had the ribs again & it is massive & incredibly tender! Let my 4 & 6-year-old try it for the first time & they enjoyed it so much, they kept asking for more! Hubby was very happy with his eggs benedict too which he said was perfectly done. We all shared a basket of sweet potato fries & it was so yummy! Oh, and I think their ondeh-ondeh cake improved vastly fr the last time I had it... Last but not least, the staff are friendly & always serving with a smile! Do make reservations coz this place is packed even on weekdays
3
New place for Lunch in the busy area like at Chinatown or Financial district. The place was very nice at the center of Telok ayer. Spacious for large group and good for business meeting. Service was excellent fast and efficient. The food came in large portion but the taste not that delicious but still OK.The price was middle up
4
As I have tried this restaurant before, I recommended my friends to visit this place. We ordered beef asparagus. It comes with 2 slices of striploins on top of 2 breads and added asparagus laid with poached eggs on top. Fantastic choice with succulent meat. The signature prawn and crayfish spaghetti is quite filling with its cream sauce. Chilli padi was added to the sauce so that it will not feel so creamy. We also ordered egg benedicts. It comes in 2 portion so for 3 people, it's really very filling with all the 3 different types of dishes. On top of that, we also ordered fries and mushroom soup which is ok only. The mango creme brulee taste more like pudding. The ice lemon tea is very refreshing. Will definitely go again
5
It was more of a spontaneous night out for us and since we had not been here before might as well,right???Turn out to be a pleasant surprise. Food was good I had the braven beef while my partner had the porched egg salmon until I saw the lamb shank....Ohhhhh....service personnel was awesome two thumbs up.will definitely be there again to have the lamb shank.
5
To get a taste of Halal french cuisine is Singapore is quite a feat. But Royz menu is quite impressive, listing a variety of meat dishes including duck! their Brazen beef is to die for!! Their cakes are really nice too! This cafe has such a nice ambience and warm staff! The staff are really friendly and are always more than willing to chat with their guests
4
Went here for dinner. Great ambience with excellent service staff. Good variety of food with good portion. Ordered their nachos (Loved the salsa; great balance of acidity and sweetness), crispy wings, sweet potato fries and pastas. The cold drip coffee (black) was strong and smooth. Enjoyed it very much. Overall, a great dining experience and I will be back again
5
Went with a girlfriend and we were given a cosy corner... Loving the ambience so much...
Ordered sweet potato fries + buffalo wings + chicken salsa rosada pasta + red wine (halal-alcohol removed) + creme bruelle... All were tasty, especially the sweet potato fries!
5
Im not a fan of duck meat, but once i was asked to have a bite, I know i will always come back for their roasted duck! I love the place, cozy and relaxing. Perfect for a date after a long day's work.
5
food is great... great ambience... servers were attentive to our needs ... the Beef Short Ribs is very tender (I highly recommend), great for bday celebrations or gathering with friends.
4
I visited for the first time today and it wasn't crowded considering it was a Saturday afternoon. We had the fries, crispy wings, fried mushrooms, spicy prawn and crayfish pasta, nachos, yuzu tart, strawberry and lemon tart, chocolate cake and strawberry shortcake. Our favourites were the fried mushrooms which tasted of truffle, and the pasta which was accompanied with generous serving of prawns and crayfish. The latter was also a tad spicy but I found it generally good value for money. Out of the desserts, our favourites were the strawberry and lemon tart, and the strawberry shortcake. The meal came up to about $133 for 6 persons, including drinks. Reservations can be made online via their website. Baby seats are available.

A much talked about cafe. 'Endorsed' by many Malay artistes. An in-place to be seen especially among the yuppies. I've decided to have our anniversary dinner here.He chose the brazen beef and recommended me the smoked duck as the main course. And my normal routine will always start with soup (perfect texture) and salad as starter. Food came. We were impressed with the generous portion served. He loves both the main - delicious. Me, a non-red meat lover, surprisingly prefers the beef than the duck. Beef was nicely done at medium rare with crispy-lightly salted fries.Perfect!We had a couple of house pour and dessert too. I must applaud that the molten lava cake is so heavenly, smooth-rich-notsosweet-cake. You'll love it! What can I say,it's a place that I would come back again. And most importantly, it's halal. Next visit, I must give that cuppa a try!!
5
Went here for a friend's birthday dinner and made reservation because I heard the place would be packed. True enough, it was. However, I was pleased my friends and I managed to sit in before our stated reservation timing. I ordered the Eggs Royale and it was simply delicious! Although there were only 2 brioches, the portion for this dish was just nice! Along with a glass of Halal red wine, which my non-Muslim friends said tasted remarkably similar to the authentic red wine. Prices for the food and beverages are reasonable. I will definitely come back
2
Came there with high expectations as my friends were raving about it. Had reservations done early in the day for dinner but was given a seat outside on a rainy day. Ordered the food, after about 10 mins the waitress came back to tell me that there will be a long waiting time of approx 30mins. The food came after 20 mins, presentation was good but.....thÃ© food was cold! Told the waitress about the cold food and they told me that there's a lot of people thus the kitchen is backed up. If the kitchen is backed up, shouldn't the food come fresh from the kitchen but late? I didn't get it but oh well..One time visit for me. Price wise wasn't too great either so if I were you looking to try a hip restaurant I would rather look at the heaps of alternatives available.
3
Came here with a friend for lunch recently and tried the fish and chips and some of the alcohol free wine. It was almost completely full and we were lucky to get seats, on stools looking out towards the temple. I was a bit disappointed with the fish which didn't really taste that fresh. The alcohol free wine was interesting - not entirely sure I've tried that before. But far better to buy a bottle for around $20 rather than paying $9 a glass! Service was friendly and efficient
4
Their Telok Ayer location is a vast improvement from their previous one in Bali Lane... Warm, cozy, spacious & still a full house! Staff is also friendly & attentive. Had the beef ribs which were so tender & well-marinated! Their special "Riviera Limon" drink is also a must-try! The dark chocolate tart is nice too but the base was a bit crumbly. Do take note though that if it's the weekend/public holiday or the eve of one, you might only have the table for a max of 2hrs as they have back-to-back reservations. Overall, my company of nine girls including myself, truly enjoyed ourselves even though we wished we could have stayed longer
5
I wanted to bring my then Fiancee out for a birthday treat and I brought her here to taste some wonderful delights. We both enjoyed this visit and will definitely come here again. For those who wants a taste of non-alcoholic red and white wine, you may come here and give it a try
3
Nice French food but nothing special can't be seen from the menu. Order some kind a beef steak served with salad and fries. We also order zero alcohol champagne. Good pairing.
Service staff quite attentive
5
Peaceful ambience and variety of choices! Love the crayfish and prawn pasta in chilli cream (lemak cili padi kinda ) spaghetti! worth every penny. would love to come back.
5
We ordered smoked duck, crayfish and prawn pasta in chilli cream and grilled/baked potato skin with mozzarella and turkey bacon (forgot the name!). The food were really awesome!! Mango Creme brulee as the dessert was absolutely delightful..esp for mango lovers..will definitely come again! :)
5
Perfect beef ribs...succulent and tasty! Good ambiance for mini gathering. Great choice of food. Will come back again...

Went there for a lunch, very close to my office. I'm pleased with food - good quality, taste nice.Friendly service, cosy atmosphere, quite & bright too.I was there only once, but my colleague visit this place more often - at least once-twice a month. Good for family/couples lunch, brunch & dinner.We had 2 mains, 1 appetizer, 2 drinks - paid $80+

This is a halal cafe, tucked away at Telok Ayer Street; out from the Singapore hip city but their food is no less tasty than any other trendiest cafe out there.Their menu has good range of starter, mains, sandwiches, desserts and beverages. Prices and portions are reasonable. Taste of food was delicious. All 8 of us ordered different types of main course and we were all happy with our food. Their coffee is great too if you need one to go along. I had my favorite affogato and it was smooth and fabulous.The wonderful team deserves an applaud too for their smiles, ever so friendly and warm service. The only one thing I didn't really enjoy was the noise during the peak of lunch time, it was too crowded.But overall, we had a great time over lunch at this cafe, it's a great place to hang out with good food and nice crew.

Found this hidden gem by word of mouthYou must make a reservation becoz when we arrived. Most tables were already reserved.We had crispy delicious sweet potato fries. Rich and thick spaghetti bolognaise. Juicy slices of smoked duck and fantastic Eggs royale! Which is eggs benedict with smoked salmon.Lovely ambiance and friendly staffIndoor and outdoor seating availableWill return for dessert next round because we are too stuffed now. Cakes I saw... Includes a red velvet nutella cake and an onde onde cake. On the menu. Lava cake too. Yums for next visi
4
good food, I had the wagyu burger and it was very well prepared and cooked as requestedservice could easily be better - items were more placed on the table than served to each customer; no relishes and condiments even after asking had to be reminded
5
Been there twice now. Both for weekday lunch. Great food. Liked the brazen beef and smoked duck. Also sampled the sandwiches. Nice food presentation. Great exotic taste. Great coffee served as well. Must try the brûlée and choc lava cakes. Good ambience and personalized service. Reasonable pricing for CBD area. Advisable to reserve ahead of visit. Will be back.

Royz Et Vous is a Halal restaurant that serves excellent meals. They also serve halal wine. Tastes quite similar to the real wine (don't ask me how I knew).I had the beef asparagus and my wife ordered the signature prawn and crayfish pasta. Boy oh boy the food was delicious. The ambiance was perfect to enjoy a sumptuous meal and the service from the staff was top notch. I think the culture there is not just to wait the table but to also understand the menu and recommend diners the best dish. We are very pleased with the service, food and even managed to talked to the owner who is a great person.We will definitely come back here for the dinner menu very soon
4
Already been 3 times to Royz&Vous, different timings and different food choices.
Every visit was a great food experience, and the service was very good too.
Friendly and helpful staff. Prices are very fair for the quality of food & service.
Will be coming back!
5
Mother-in-law 84th BD luncheon - its a 5star as she enjoyed the duck, beef and soup. The dessert of lava cake was a bonus. The most would be that there is a mosque to do our obligatory solat and continue the enjoyment of merrymaking.
4
We came here after lunch today for some coffee. I was very happy with my cappuccino: just the right temperature and with a pretty little design and great taste. Easy to find near the temple in Telok Ayer street.
5
I was there with my husband for our compulsory fridate. It was our first time and we were definitely impressed. Food servings were proportionate and everything that we ordered were perfect. Will be back.
Highly recommended.
4
Found this cafe on a hot & humid walk around the outskirts of China town. Bespoke coffee and teas in a nice air conditioned environment.
5
In the different 2 days I was there, I had ordered the brazen beef, smoked duck, braised duck, the salmon herb and braised lamb, chocolate rainbow cake and dark chocolate tart.Here are my ratings:Brazen Beef - 4.5/5 (Meat was great tender, cooked and seasoned perfectly, I just didnt like why its being served with fries, makes the classiness drop a bit)Smoked duck - 5/5 (My favourite dish)Braised duck- 4.5/5 (love it)The salmon herb- 4/5 (Not my favourite dish of everything)Braised lamb- 4.5/5 ( I can't remember why i did not give it 5/5)chocolate rainbow cake - 3.5/5 (can find better rainbow cake elsewhere, abit dense for my liking)Dark chocolate tart - 5/5 (favourite tart, I wish I had ordered more
4
Back in Singapore for a few days and my Son wanted to eat out and so here we were along with my Wife. Didn't make reservation as wifey thought it'll be fine but ended up having to sit at the tall table which was perfect. Loved the layout with huge windows, spaced out tables and fun crew! Menu is not big but enough. My boy had Eggs Royale as he's a fan of salmon and wifey had Beef Asparagus which is beef served on Thai pencil asparagus on muffin and topped with poached egg and hollandaise sauce. They both enjoyed their meal. I had the signature pasta, pasta were cooked al dente, I like, but unfortunately it was swimming with Chilli padi cream sauce. I'm not a fan! If only the sauce was a little thicker and not runny and swimming. Would come back to try the sliders, lamb and beef ribs when I'm back in SG again. It was a nice experience though and would recommend it to friends for sure as this place has vibes!
5
Went to celebrate mine & daughter's birthday in Nov 15. Restaurant is easily spotted by the road side. Looks nice from outside and very cool ambience in the inside. There's 2 people serving at the restaurant. Very friendly & knowledgeable. We tried the soup of the day which is carrot & diced potato. Soup is good only the potato is a bit uncooked. The appetizer is buffalo wings ~ very hot & spicy. Tried egg benedict - fantastic. Brazen beef - medium done and very juicy. Short rib is fantastic too. Prawn & crayfish pasta is ok. We tried red wine fm Spain (alcohol was taken out). It's an acquired taste and one may not like the after taste but it's a bit different. Nice iced chocolate & home-made ice lemon tea. We finish it off with creme brulee ~ very good. I would definitely go back again to try other main course. Only thing it's a bit costly cause it's in town area
4
Been here twice and both were positive experience. enjoyed the food - duck salad, salmon & beef asparagus. quite decent prices and best of all, no service charge but open for tipping. would love to come back time and again, as long as they keep service and food quality up
5
Organized a get together dinner with some friends last night to try out this new found place around our office area. And boy were we glad we had our catch up session there. Service staff was super nice and the food's amazing! Would definitely organize another catch up session with the peers here. Keep it up! :
