Almost empty on a Wednesday evening in Duxton, meant we got good service and the food was flying out of the Kitchen super fast!
Seats are quite uncomfortable in the whole restaurant, but the food is ok, just add some salt.

The place was very quiet at lunch time. However the food was tasty and healthy and overall a delightful find! Not big portions so please be mindful it’s a light healthy lunch. Good for quiet discussion.

Sabio have never failed to disappoint. Great range of quality Tapas and beautiful sangria to boot. Always a pleasure coming here after work with mates

We made a stop at this bar on our way as we were strolling around. We only had a glass of wine.
Staff proposed us a second one which we refused as this place is expensive for what it is...

Firstly, I like the commercial experimentation. They have an all you can eat option, they have a number of bundled options - 5 dishes for x, 8 dishes for y, etc. I also liked the bathroom, once my eyes adjusted. The server was friendly although the wine list (particularly for glasses) was rudimentary. A few dishes were disappointing - particularly the Tortilla Espanola (for a dish often termed the spanish omelette, this was all potato, minimal egg, and the potatoes were significantly undercooked / crunchy. The Calamares a la plancha was overcooked and chewy. The rest was great - special call outs on the croqetas, the gazpacho and the gambas pil pil. The ceviche was also great. So i think they do a great job for the price point, but the dishes are not invariably superb, but nonetheless great on average. Well worth a visit

For $30++ for a 3hr free-flow window of cava or sangria, whats not to like?Add to this the delicious food that's made to order (also very reasonably priced) and its a recipe for a great way to wile away a Sunday afternoon.The staff are friendly but on particularly busy Sunday's they can sometimes forgot a few items ordered but again, you have 3hrs in which to leisurely enjoy whats on offer

Sabio is definitely one of my favorite hang out restaurants in Singapore. The amazing quality of the ingredient, the diversity of the dishes, the fun staff who always joins in the jokes and laughters. And they also have great deals to make this very attractive price wise when we know how expensive Singapore can be.. Would be great to extend a bit their happy hour by 30mn or 1hr at least but that won't stop me from going back with friends

Food was really tasty, service was awesome.Just that the prawns texture used in the dishes are too “crunchy “ and “bouncy” . It would be perfect if the prawns were more “textured” as after a while when u eat too much of the “crunchy” ones, the body has some rejections to the taste. Hope the restaurant can pre prepare the prawns in their menu in a different way.

We stopped here for a couple of drinks and ordered both the red and white Sangria. They taste just like cheap fruit juices mixed with water. You can't even feel the wine and there is no fresh fruit in it!!! Then comes the largely overpriced tapas. We ordered the pulpo a la gallega. What we received was just ridiculous, 9 small pieces of pulpo bathing in oil. Nothing to do with what pulpo a la gallega should be!!!In conclusion don't go to this place, they don't deserve your money!!
3
I went for the set lunch menu plus the option of upsize the tapas for free on Mondays and Tuesdays... maybe the choices I made weren't so great... I choose the gazpacho (1 cup of cold tomato sauce) and as the main capsicum chicken with looooots if tomato sauce. So, really I didn't enjoyed my lunch.I have to say that they have a very broad selection of tapas, cold and hot, for an average of 12sng dollars.The place is small and the staff was very friendly
3
Been with some friends without any reservation on a Saturday night ! We took the offer at 50$ for free flow tapas and it was not disappointing - you better be very hungry!
The sangria however is not very good.
4
Some of their tapas are really good (vieras en salsa de cava), others are not bad. I will come back for sure one day
5
Great casual tapas bar, good for a night out with friends, reasonably priced. Try the 'all you can eat', it's really good value!

I had better memories of this place, but last Saturday these turned out to be from too long ago. This place has 2 tables of four, 1 table of six and that's it. The rest has to sit at some sort of bench with the food in between you but you have to turn to your food all the time so your back and neck starts to hurt after an hour or so. Then there's the bar seats where nobody, really nobody sat longer than 1 minute because the chairs are way too close to one another and there is no space under the bar to put your feet and legs so you have to face them sideways. Really really really strange and very very uncomfortable. Anyways, the sangria is OK I guess but definitely not spectacular (no fruit, not a lot of alcohol and too much ice), the verduras vegies were OK, the ham croquettes were splendid, but the octopus was average and the clams in wine sauce were very good though. Then there were people standing outside smoking with all the smoke going inside, and if you're not a smoker than that's not very pleasant. All in all, there are a lot of tapas places in Singapore and we won't be going back there again I believe.

This place is our absolute fav Tapa Bar in Singapore! Intimate, value for money and the most delicious tapa selection! It's a small cosy restaurant perfect for small groups/ couples. Bar or counter seating finds yourself chatting with the waitstaff and barmen and perusing the cured meats and wine selections.The service is personalised, and informal, it's in a great location and value for money, you can't beat it! They even have live music on weekends. A great atmosphere which keeps us coming back!

Average food with awkard seating. Too cramp at the entrance area with the seat that your legs are facing the customers when they walk pass. Music is good but environment & food could be better. Octopus was over cooked and mostly chewy (inconsistently ). Sauce was full of oil.Staff were all new and didn't know the menu.Left for somewhere better
5
I love tapas! I've been to Spain at least 15 times and this place brought back some nice memories I have from Andalucia and Mallorca. Calamari, octopus and black mussels are to die for..so yummy! Sangria was very refreshing. Jamon was delicious. Would love to try more of their hot tapas when I am back in Singapore

Service: I was a bit disappointed with one of the waiters at the restaurant when we arrived. She was obviously upset about something and it showed in her face and attitude when she served us. Being in the service line, i feel this is unaccetable. However, the manager's cheerfulness changed our mood. Food: The "All you can eat buffet" is good value for money! I enjoyed all the Hot Tapas dishes. The Pulpo con Sofrito, Gambas Pil Pil and Clams with Garlic Sauce is a must try
5
Thank you for the warm welcome and the food experience. Ask for Olivier the owner and you will be well taken care of. Great place to hang out to eat, to get a drink before your next stop... Enjoy and don't forget to order the croquetas jamon
5
One of the nicest teams in Singapore. If you talk to them, they will make you feel right at home.The vibe is super chill and perfect for catching up with friends. The tapes are perfect comfort food for a lite bite and can easily be made into a meal.Go for any day of the week
1
Terribly bland, pre-prepared, tasteless food with the worst Sangria we have ever tasted.
Customer unfriendly, poor service and arrogant attitude. Quite simply a waste of time and money.
4
The place overall was nice and cosy, food was very tasty and our waiter was really friendly. Would recommend this place for a casual night out!
5
A very comprehensive tapas menu. The eat all you can buffet choice was very good.
The seafood were all very tasty, especially liked the prawns which were very fresh that night.
Great night out with friends!
4
Another visit where we had Friendly staff, nice atmosphere and yummy food. This venue is good for date nights or dinner with friends
1
Service was awful, food was fine though. Will never come again to this place. Live here one year already, so far worse in town.
5
Enjoyed Saturday night tapas at Sabio. The service and quality of the food was excellent. Especially liked the chorizo and garlic shrimp dishes...delish!! Just like back in Spain.
1
Really not Good!We went for the All you can Eat Tapas (which in theory sounds good) $39++Honestly it was a disappointment!The Oysters did not taste fresh, the cheese croquettes did not taste of cheese, and the meatballs were clearly processed, they tasted like Fray Bentos Meatballs that they put into there own sauce.The garlic prawns were ok, but I cannot think of any dish I would order again!It's a nice venue and the ambience is nice but the food was shocking
4
Tried the all you can eat tapas which is great value for money. Unfortunately the jamon ham isn't part of the deal but still pretty good selection such as the gambas, mushroom, chicken and the heavenly meatballs. The only complaint is that the seating is probably not the most comfortable.
4
This is a splendid little tapas bar, tucked away in Duxton Hill near Chinatown. The 'all you can eat' tapas at S$40++ per person is great value and has a really good choice. The only reservation I had was about the wine, which was just a bit ordinary for the two glasses I had at S$16 and S$20 each. Maybe the choice by bottle is better. Good atmosphere even on a Sunday night when we were there
4
Good selecton, very cute ans neat place, pretty generous tapas and not so expensive Love the meatballs!!White sangria is good but could be slightly better i believe..Service is not so bad but could be more attentiveHow ever i'll be back soon as soon i get back to Singapore.Nice for a relaxing Sunday with a bunch of friend
5
Eat here if you like tapas. Hammon is super good, sea food too. I could have eaten the whole list :)
4
We went there for tapas and we liked the food and the sangria, but the service was a little slow and not too friendly.
4
- cheery tapas bar at a Duxton Hill shophouse
- plenty of items on the menu (bet you want to try ordering in Spanish)
- sangrias are great, the best thing on a hot day
4
Been here a few times after work and this is a good place for tapas and wine! However, the seats are not so comfy, but's it's okay for a casual dinner + drinks.
4
Delicious meal. Their liquor selection is not particularly extensive, but the drinks are really good. They make their mojitos with black sugar. The spinach goat cheese salad was amazing. And their meat platter is fantastic. The bread is perfect. The portion sizes are big for tapas. We ordered too much food. We will definitely be back.
5
Stumbled passed this little gem in Duxton Hill just wanting a cold beer after work and their outdoor setting looked inviting. 2 hours later I am rolling out after 9 nice dishes from their $39.95 eat it all tapas. I have already warned my GF that I need some serious exercise tonight as it was way too much food and here I'm not even talking about the great Spanish wines and beers I had to suffer thru.Highly recommended!
5
There are few place in Singapore where you can retreat from the hustle and bustle of the busy business district or shopping centre and Duxton Hill around lunchtime is one of such places. I ended up at Sabio's to sample some of their tapas dishes and it was a truly enjoyable lunch. Food was great quality and true tapas style, and the service staff friendly and forthcoming. I can only recommend Sabio's for lunch. Next time I need to try it for dinner
2
A great catch up with friends ended on a bad note with the manager insisting on charging ala-carte price for wastage even if we said we would take away the food. A friend informed the manager that she had diarrhea after eating and simply cannot finish the 1 dish anymore. Yet the manager dared her to see a doctor and provide a medical diagnosis that her diarrhea was caused by the restaurant's food. Great way to show concern for your patrons. Definitely not returning for a second visit.

The restaurant itself is a little small, but we were able to get a marble table for six along the side instead of a bar top seat by reserving early and requesting for the normal tables. Six of us tried the all-you-can-eat buffet since it was our first visit, and this way we could try most of the food. Food and service were on the whole good and enjoyable, except that the fried oysters needed several rounds of reminders before they were finally being served. Gambas pil pil (grilled prawns), clams in garlic sauce, meatballs, chorizo, mushrooms, grilled chicken with garlic, and seafood salad (essentially various fish) were crowd favourites. However, certain dishes such as the prawns were served in fives, which was a little strange for our party of six. Would have been easier for sharing if the servers or chef took notice of this little detail, but nothing to really complain about. The sangria was just average personally. And the place was really quite stuffy, especially in light of the recent bout of high temperatures in Singapore. The aircon was on presumably at full power and we voiced our concern to the servers. While they knew it was warm and humid, they did not really try to alleviate the situation. It was rather energy draining under such humid conditions, and things certainly could have been better handled in this aspect.

Overall not a bad place at all, had some great oysters, lovely Spanish white wine, the tapas list offered is nice and sufficient. The service varies a bit, first time was here on a Sunday arrived around 9pm and got the bill at 9:45, without any warning or call for last order??Last visit was a Friday evening and the service was good
1
Went there for a family dinner of 9 people.
Food was pretty good.
Service was absolutely horrible.
Swearing infront of us.
It was just unpleasant and would never want to go back ever again.
3
It was not crowded, but had a long wait for my food order. Very uncomfortable seats at the bar. Thankfully, the Spanish sandwiches and potato omelette were decent. Located in a conservation shophouse in a nice area.
4
Trendy Spanish tapas bar in Duxton Hill. The food can be very good, if a little expensive. Unless you're sat at the bar, the seating arrangements can be a little uncomfortable, particularly for large groups.

I went there last night with my partner. It's on Duxton street. We drove on our way. Parking is a bit small within the area so better come early. Otherwise, you can get the services of a valet parker for $7. If you're taking the train, nearest station would be Outram Park Station. So we ordered three tapas: Calamari, Chorizo and Jamon Iberico (cold cuts ham). Interestingly, according to the waitress, the ham was cured for 5 years. Then we tried the Paella Negra, which different from the usual paellas I've tried because they used noodles instead of rice. It was so good though. I loved it. We also ordered Red Sangrias on a jug which good for 5-6 glasses. Then lastly, we tried their Catalan Crema for dessert which was their version of Creme Brulee.Overall, i liked this tapas bar. Not to mention that the waitress was very accommodating and offered suggestions to us.Total Bill Amount: $15

...it is not long ago that Sabio was one of my most favourite spots to go on Saturday or Sunday. However, this has recently changed as I feel the quality of food is not up to previous standards anymore.It has never been the most accommodation place ( the seating arrangement you love or either hate) neither it was a cheap place... but the service and food were really good. Since that has changed within the last 6-8 month I have honestly to say... it is only fair now.... and with the drop in service and food quality I can only perceive it as expensive which made me lose the appetite to go more often there....Having said this, it is still a good place to go but I would be really happy if standards could be back as in previous times..

First thing you will notice when you step in is the funky and modern decor of this place. The food here is generally good. Service is very fast, staff are very friendly. Even though the place is small, it creates a lively and cosy atmosphere.Go for the hot tapas. They are generally all quite good and don't forget to order your jug of Sangria. And yes, the unusual white sangria is served here
5
This place is small and doesn't take reservations (I think) so it could be difficult to get a spot if you get there late. The food's delish! and it's always nice sitting by the bar, enjoying the tapas - especially like the prawns, octopus, chorizo and chicken..(OK I guess it's all good) while sipping on sangria and listening to a 2 piece live duo.Definitely one of my fave spots on a Fri

Sorry guys, I can see you work hard, but the food is not at the same level than the service. It is not Spanish at all, I doubt they use olive oil to cook... And, even worse: food is not good. It is not only absolutely not real, but also is not good. Simply like that.
4
We spent a really nice night with our friends!Our waitress was really nice.Our tapas (ham, chorizo, scallops, tortilla..) were amazing! So tasty!And Sangria was really good too!Only one bad point: bread! When the waiter promotes it, he forgets to tell you that you pay 1$ per slice!And when he proposes you to order bread, he doesn't tell you that is sold by 8! So be careful
5
This is our favorite here in Singapore and always consistently excellent. We have been here a number of times and will continue to return. Love the extensive menu, the delicious food and the fast and efficient service. This place is a tiny little tapas bar in Duxton Hill and is always packed. We have taken friends and family here on many occasion and we have not once received any negative feedback. Our guests have loved it. On selected nights they have a live performer, who always make it the perfect evening.

Our favorite tapas place in Singapore...have been many times and never reviewed it. Food is excellent and service friendly
1
People there did not know how to say sorry to customers who were unattended for more than 30 min without any clues when food will be ready
3
Came here recently for the set lunch. We were the only 2 people in the restaurant, so I presume they are much busier in the evenings. Set lunch was fairly basic but reasonable value at about $30 each including a glass of quite ordinary sangria.
4
this is our usual sunday brunch place when we crave lots of succulent and well cooked seafood and easy sangrias to get trollied on.No reservations and seatings only when all are present. please note this.Our usual list of must haves:Calamari, garlic prawns (my fave), oysters, iberico jammon, meatballs, "paella", seafood saladchorizo, ham croquettes, mussels, chachouka.CHURROS!been here 6 times last year after we finally discovered it in July 2014, here's to many many more times in 2015

Sabio looks great - ithas gorgeous tiles and a great bar where you can view some of the cold tapas selection. The sangria was divine with just the right kick. The octopus was out of this world good and we scraped every last bit up with bread. Unfortunately the rest of the food we tried (in particular the meatballs) was just ok. The place has a nice and friendly vib
5
From the moment you walk into Sabio you feel like its going to be a new experience... a unique one, and from that moment you don't look back.We were greeted by a super cool and friendly manager who asked how many in our party, drinks or dinner, and if we were ok to sit at the bar... we took the bar. The food is delicious and reasonably priced, we ate, drank and even shared our meal with new friends that we made sitting along the bar. Overall, fabulous night, we will be back there again, and again for sure
5
We went to Sabio for brunch with some friends on a Sunday and were suitably impressed. There was a free flow of pretty much everything, including Cava and Sangria, which is always a great end to the weekend! The tapas were also refilled without prompting, which all-in-all lead to a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Iâ€™ve also been there after work a number of times, the sharing plates and wines by the glass make it a casual and fun place to meet up with friends for birthdays or just a casual drink and they have live music sometimes
1
There was 4 of us but we were given a table for 6, and told to keep 2 seats empty "because it is a sharing table". We had not yet finished our jug of sangria but the waitress cleared it away without asking if we are done with it. When we asked for more napkins (we were given only 3 when there was 4 of us), she practically threw another 2 napkins down at the table and stalked off.We paid $155 for 2 jugs of sangria, a plate of calamari, a ham & sausage platter & a serving of churros. Our money would probably have been better spent elsewhere! Extremely disappointed
1
Had a couple of drinks there, and my sangria didn't have any fruit in it. When we complained, the guy behind the bar said they 'ran out of fruit' - but surprisingly, the group who turned up later (but ordered a jug had fruit in theirs). Would appreciate if they let people know if a major component of a drink is not available. Not a particularly sincere apology from the guy behind the bar
3
I was there some weeks ago with some friends, but we're planning to come back soon. Even if food is not Spanish at all and neither quite good, you have free flow for practically everything (including oysters) and also free flow of cava and sangria for less than $50!So, this is the perfect plan for a Sunday: eat and drink all that you can for a fixed price. I recommend you oysters and cava to start and then try some tapas. My favourite one is pimientos piquilo, that I already tried in sabio by the sea. By the way, this brunch is only available in sabio, not in sabio by the sea, where the brunch is expensive and not really good.Go early, because could be quite crowded. And service is good, but sometimes they could be really busy... or just understaffed
