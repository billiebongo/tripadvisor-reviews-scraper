Really tasty ramen - I liked the kazan style broth. It was super filling but couldn't stop eating, it was so good! Perfect place to stop by for lunch.

We had their hot stone ramen and it was so delicious . It is filled with veggies, noodles and tender pork meat . One large portion was enough to share for two people. The pork was so delicious , normally I give to my husband , this time he had to fight for his share. Don’t go too early as the waiting line is long. After 8:30pm it is a good time to come

Visited this outlet in Square 2 over the weekend for lunch and had to wait for about 20 mins before we were ushered into the rather small compact crowded restaurant. We immediately ordered 2 sets of the large Kazan Shoyu Ramen and a plate of Karaage. Waiting time to experience the FUNKA was surprisingly short despite the crowd. Staff were efficiently clearing the tables and attending to orders and request. The ramen blended with the rich Tonkotsu broth was simply delicious. The Karaage was well fried and presented. Overall, dining experience was pleasant and enjoyable. Will try out the other outlets when we crave for the volcanic ramen again

Ate there at 3pm on a Saturday, the first time in 5 visits to the Mall in the past week where there wasn't a queue.Had the Sukiyaki Kazan (Beef) speciality which was both flavoursome and plentiful, in fact it was a rare occasion when I actually had to leave some and also declined the complimentary rice.Cosy atmosphere and the table was a little small for all the associated bowls and accompaniments but it is very typical Japanese Ramen.Service was prompt, friendly and, as you would expect, polite.Would I go back - yes absolutely good value, good foo

If I really have to be honest, it's not worth the calories and precious lunchtime for it.Funnily there's a Long queue almost every time I passed by. The noodles aren't all that fantastic. In fact, I feel they taste rather localised.. not sure if it's just me, but will I go back? Answer is no

Very nice broth and affordable. Good hearty serving. Free boiled eggs if you want on the table. We tried the shio and shiu broth. Both were good. Our neighbor says her order of ramen was a little salty. Later heard someone ordering but stated “less salty”. Long queue at lunchtime but didn’t wait too long for our food.

I came to this ramen shop with high expectation due to its rave reviews. I had the specialty (volcano) - beef which was advertised solely with just one menu while my companion tried the typical ramen (Char siew). We did sample each other's ramen using small separate bowls. I prefer the char siew meat which tastes like pig's trotters (lean) meat part. Thick and chewy, my kind of meat. The specialty that I had have lots of cabbage and other types of vegetables and hence make the broth sweet which is not to my liking as I prefer savory. The portion was big enough that I skipped the complimentary rice. Gyozas were oily and burnt. In terms of service, it was prompt and fast and they do serve water (hot and cold). Tables were close to each other and space was really tight. Perhaps the atmosphere and seating arrangement is that of typical Japanese ramen shop. Hard boiled eggs were placed on every table with an empty bowl for its shells. There seems to be non-stop flow of customers having passed by a few times. Hence, we chose to have a later lunch at about 1.45 pm in order to avoid the lunch crowd

like in japan. even the people who serve you is japanese. i ate gyoza and a big portion of vulcano noodles. very good taste. the thick soup make the magic. sea food or meat both were good. maybe it's not the cheapest eat in town but if you like japanese food it's a good choice

Have been to this Ramen restaurant at least once a month for its delicious food and usual excellent service. However, this evening (13 July) we requested for our usual seats at counter (with 3 high chairs there), a staff named Cindy rudely told me 'No!one person only!' I couldn't understand the meaning of her broken English, thus tried to ask her for the reason, but was harshly brushed off by Cindy with a furious glare. Indeed surprised at her attitude and the reason for her being so angry, probably she really hates her job, I guess? Fortunately other staff there were still very professional and polite, food was as delicious as usual. It took us 30 mins to have our dinner, the 3 seats at counter had been empty throughout, while we did see customers queue outside.From the loyalty card & some better changes in this outlet, we can see the efforts made by Tonkotsu management/owner to keep their loyal customers, which makes it really difficult for me to comprehend why staff Cindy tried to do things against company's philosophy while she's getting her salary

We stayed about a week in Singapore at the Novotel so this restaurant became our canteen. We tried the ramens,the Kazans, the fried pawns, gyozas etc etc everything was cooked to perfection. The people there are very polite and efficient, kitchen is spotless. I have a very fragile stomach and foreign foods usually do not agree with me. That's the only place I have been able to go to for the whole week with no upset tummy !And it is reasonably priced. Must go to kind of place
4
We've been here a few times and like their ramen and gyoza. The noodles are firm and the soup base tastes nice and fresh. The service is very good.
Would definitely recommend trying the ramen here.
4
Good restaurant serving Ebi katsu curry on claypot and chicken karaage. Their ramen is average for my standard, but better than Ajisen ramen. Service is good, but place a bit cramp.
4
Get the stone bowels.. It's a lot more interesting cooking on the table. Soap base very good. Noodles good texture. Comes with rice. Portions are pretty big. A small bowel is enough if getting side dishes. Alcohol is reasonably priced.
4
The Liang Court shopping centre generally is good at restoring your faith in finding quality ramen outside Japan. Kazan's specialty is rich yet delicate tonkotsu broths and I REALLY enjoyed the broth. There were some good condiments and nice firm noodles as well. However, the chashu was thick and chewy - maybe just a personal preference but I like the thin delicate slices much better - and the gyoza seemed excessively burnt, so I'll still rate it below Marutama upstairs. On the other hand, $13 for ramen is a bargain in Singapore, plus Kazan was only half full whereas there was a queue to get into Marutama, so I'd definitely return to Kazan
5
Popped in here twice now in our first week in Singapore. There's a 'lively' vibe coming from the kitchen and the restaurant is a vibrant, compact hub of steaming broth and red funnels. The main thrust is a pork based broth with ramen noodles but there are many sides and drinks including beer. It's popular so there's a constant ebb and flow of people, food and amazing smells. The broth is excellent. Like a roast pork dinner with each ladle full. I can't recommend it enough. Enjoy

This place is often packed with diners. Finally got a chance to sample their best sellers tonight. We ordered the set of shoyu ramen, ebi fry curry and gyoza. Then, we topped it off with karaage or fried chicken cutlets. Great taste ! Quick service.Highly recommended.
4
We ordered a Tonkotsu Kazan Ramen, 2 Shoyu Ramen, fried rice and gyoza for 1 adult and 2 kids.... Portion of the Kazan Ramen was big! Couldn't add rice after that as too filling.... Fried rice in hot stone bowl was awesome! Thanks to the recommendation of the staff.... Gyoza was nice too.... Worth coming back again..
4
Other than the restaurant being rather packed during lunch time (possibly due to the many office workers heading out to lunch at the same time, this is a great place for jap food. They do it well and it is delicious. Worth a repeat visit... but only because I work in the vicinity
4
Situated in Liang court it offers the infamous volcano ramen that comes in a 'tajin' brown pot. Boiled eggs are complimentary.They also have set ramen with gzoza fried dumplings.Staff are friendly and the young Japanese chef has put up a notice welcoming to befriend Singapore girls
4
Lunch with my wife, food very fresh and well cooked and presented. Well accompanied by Asahi beers! (The cheapest in Singapore at S$6)In a shopping centre hard to find but well worth the effort. We stumbled across it whilst visiting Clarke Quay on the topless bus
4
Selection of ramen is enormous. The volcano pots are a bit of a gimmick. Ramen is always cooked al dente although some of the soup can be a bit hotter in temperature. Staff are helpful although a bit forgetful at times.
5
The ramen is very shiok and delectable. Never have I tasted such delicious soup ...the portion is just nice and the curry rice is equally tasty as well. Worth the visit. Price is reasonable.
5
great stuff, good staff, wonderful soup and all the goodies and extras you could ever want in a bowl of Ramen
5
A wonderful place to eat a bowl of ramen. I eat there at least three times every time I am in Singapore. Try one of their miso gyoza sets for about $16.00. My favourite is the spicy one..
4
I recommend this restaurant . Friendly staff and very delicious food . Hot stone bowl ramen & rice must be tasted. fair price
4
Most of the food (Ramen & fried rice) are tasty & really nice. Just find that the restaurant is small & cramp.
5
Went there for dinner, warm welcome from the staff though restaurant seemed to be busy upon our visit. Waiting staff knows his menu really well, tried their Ramen set, both gyoza&Raman taste awesome. Upon departure from the restaurant, all the staff extended their hearty thank you to us. What really impressed us was that I accidentally left my bag on the table, one staff rushed out and politely returned my bag, his name is Liang.We'll return and put it into our list :

One of the ramen restaurant which I feel I will be the return customer. I tried only the signature ramen in hot stone. The portion is huge is you order big bowl, just nice for 2 person to share. if you are alone, getting a small portion is enough. It comes with free rice, I tried and still prefer the soup with ramen. I checked with the staff and understand that we can have soup refill if we want. The only problem I have with ramen is the soup normally very salty. 1st try I feel the soup is just nice but 2nd try i feel too salty. I guess that depends on personal preferences
5
Best ramen ever. Must Choose the hot stone style ramen. After eating the ramen from this place, no other ramen I had eaten match the standard. After finishing the ramen, add the rice to the soup. U will feel the different. No words can describe. Thumbs up
5
We found this restaurant upstairs in the shopping center near the Oasia Hotel and metro stop. The pork ramen was plenty for lunch for two but we had the gyozo also and it was totally delicious. The ramen came in stages. First a pitcher of hot broth. Then a stoneware bowl filled with pork, noodles, and vegetables sitting on a hot rock. The waitress poured the broth on and covered it, let it sit until steam came out of a small hole in the top, and then started a one minute sand timer. After the minute it was ready to serve into our bowls. We ate a few servings and then she brought a bowl of rice which she dumped into the still hot broth and we finished it all off. Everything was really, really good
5
Excellent Ramen. Try the Volcano ramen. The eggs are great. Tomato salad and goyza is a must try. Chicken karage is also crispy.
4
I'm not a ramen connoisseur and can't really tell the difference between average ramen and good ramen. To me, the ramen here is tasty, definitely not bad. I was at their Liang Court outlet and their egg was done just right. No complaints.
4
Visited this place for lunch during a work day. Spot is small but popular. Queues are the norm. Had a seafood ramen bowl suitable for 2 with a shared gyoza. Great tasting food and service was good. If you like ramen, you'll like this place.
5
I stumbled across this amazing ramen restaurant when I was out exploring the neighbourhood near my hotel. I was drawn in by the delicious smells and the sound of happy eaters.I was not disappointed the ramen was good, the soup broth well flavoured and tasty, the pork was tender and overall the noodles were very enjoyable. I ordered a side of Gyozas and they were a lovely savoury treat.I have been to Singapore 3 times on business now and very time I have been back to this yummy place, sometimes more than once per a trip, they even do take ways.I cannot recommend this place enough it's so good and the staff are super friendly
5
Cosy restaurant in Liang Court on the ground floor. Staff are very polite and enthusiastic. The food was served very quickly and piping hot! Tried the Kazan ramen - very interesting and fun! Time with the hourglass and watch the volcano! Free hard boiled eggs at every table. Generous portions of pork with the ramen, absolutely yummy too.Kids meal only $6! Comes with a toy too. Cheaper than Ajisen Ramen. I loved the decor. Every table display is different! Rated by ladyironchef as one of the top ten ramen places in Singapore! Lives up to its reputation indeed
5
We did the Liang Court outlet.. twice during out stay. Loved the Ramen and the kids loved the Fried Rice. The hot bowl versions and the Volcano where they cook at the table was entertaining and a little different from what we were used to.. Long story short though the flavour was the bees knees. I could quite happily go back if there weren't so many other must do venues in Singapore..

I went there for lunch on July 4,2015. It was semi busy. The ramen noodle was OK. It was nothing special about it. Added soy sauce soup tastes a bit nicer than added salt paste. Pork belly was thick and soft. Foods overall was OK. The hot green tea was not the same that I use to had in Japan. It was a Chinese green tea NOT a real Japanese green. Theses 2 type of origin gave a big different on aroma and taste. It was easy to spot that which one not a real Japanese after stayed in Kyoto, Tokyo and Nagoya for 2+ weeks. The price charge 3S$ per cup I think I deserved Japanese not Chinese green tea

First of all, i love love love ramen! I chanced upon this ramen shop in Liang court with my husband and we decided to give it a try since there wasn't any Q to get in (it was close to 6pm on a Friday). It was one of the best food decisions we have made! We ordered a couple of sides, a Chashu Shoyu Ramen for me and a Karamiso Ramen for him. Our food came after a 15mins wait and the first taste of my ramen broth totally blew me away! It was so flavorful and smooth with a whiff of sesame oil and i couldn't stop drinking it! The noodle was cooked just the way i like, not overcooked and a lil springy. The chashu was melt in your mouth and i finished the whole bowl of goodness within minutes! The sides, on the other hand, were abit lacking. I preferred the gyoza over the karaage. All in all, the meal was worth every single calorie
4
Went to the Liang Court Branch and ordered shoyu ramen. Thoroughly enjoyed the entire bowl. The noodles looked a bit undercooked but was actually nice and firm. Free boiled eggs is a bonus! It's perfect to extend the thickness of the soup with crumbled egg yolks. Service is typical Japanese, loud greetings, fast & efficient food delivery to the table. Nothing more, nothing less. I tried to ask waiter if curry ramen is spicy, he first said no then when I asked again to be sure he said yes. Not sure if it's the noisy place or his lack of English skills. I decided to be on the safe side and ordered the basic shoyu. It may not be the best ramen in Singapore but I will be back for my bowl of comfort noodles
5
I'm a ramen lover , can't get enough of them. I came across this shop and it doesn't appear to too traditional. I love really traditional ramen that is simple but nice, in a simple setting. The volcano ramen doesn't appeal to me at first. As it looks like some fancy gimmick to change tradition. For some reason, we went in and for some reason, I ordered the volcano ramen. To my surprise, it was very good. The soup is nice, the noodle is good, and although portion is big (I ordered the large size), I finished up all the soup! It's not better at some really authentic ramen, but it is much better than be many outlets you get in Singapore
4
We were staying nearby and chanced upon this restaurant. It was a good experience and we really enjoyed our main courses that we chose. The dessert was a lovely and surprising finale to an enjoyable meal. We recommend the volcano Icecream -it was a hoot.
5
i tried the ramen in the hot pot and i really enjoyed it so much. the soup was flavourful and the noodles were springy. another dish worth trying is the claypot rice as well. i will definitely come back again!

Shoyu ramen was too salty and worse was the tomato stone rice. The sauce was literally made from tomato ketchup. How disappointing despite all the good reviews

Wanting something soupy for dinner that night, The Beau and I headed for ramen, since the "volcano ramen" concept seemed interesting, and this was one of the restaurants at Novena Square 2 that was not crowded on a Saturday evening.It was a small and non-discreet little Japanese restaurant with rather friendly and jovial service crew. The setting was simple but richly infused with authentic Japanese decor.For mains, I had the Chashyu Karamiso Ramen (SGD$15.00) with kimchi and flavored egg. It was supposed to be spicy, but it wasn't, though the soup was tasty. I don't get why we were given three halves of the flavored egg, but anyway eaten with the spicy kimchi, it was good. The pork slices were tender, firm and thick - very lovely to chew. The noodles looked springy / hard but were actually rather soft - I would prefer the doneness a little more taut.The Beau had the Hot Stone Curry Fried Rice (SGD$7.00) - which he had to constantly stir so the rice would not stick to the pot. The rice was rather crispy, and the curry was good - the taste was distinctive without being overly spicy. The pork slices on top of the fried rice were rather tender as well. The portion was just nice, making it a rather fulfilling meal.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/08/dinner-at-tonkotsu-kazan-ramen.htm

Visited the Liang Court outlet with the family for lunch and was pretty happy with the experience. Good quality ramen, broth not too oily, and decent gyoza. Indeed, the ramen + gyoza set is fairly good value at $16++. My 4 year old daughter is quite particular about her ramen but she seemed to enjoy this place. Service could be better, but otherwise no complaints. Will no doubt visit again
4
Had a late lunch here, at around 2.30pm so there was almost no crowd. Ordered a Ramen Set ($16 - $18), which cost $17, and a Kazan Miso Ramen for $18. The ramen set my friend had chosen was the original, and a hot stone fried rice. The noodles itself were great and one of the better ones we've tasted so far. The hot stone fried rice arrived sizzling with raw egg and cooked meat, and we had to mix / cook it ourselves. 15 minutes into eating and it was still really hot. Similarly, the Kazan Miso arrived in a very very hot stone pot, and was so so so so so so huge. The waiter will add the soup to it, and it'll cook. I finished perhaps only half of it. The noodles got a little soggy after awhile and it tasted a little like kimchi-based soup so perhaps the others may be more to my liking, personally. the soup is free flow and you could add $2 for extra noodles, so it could be shared!Service was very prompt and attentive. However one of the wait staff were constantly shouting out japanese greetings / phrases to nobody, and it got a little annoying after awhile! Overall good :

Had ramen here and after tasting so many ramen joints both here in Singapore and many parts of Japan, I just wanna say that the ramen here is average. Not too bad but nothing to shout about. As many reviewers had mentioned, the broth is lacking and plainly saltish without the thick flavour. The char shu is also a tack to hard for my liking. But this can be personal just like taste buds are subjective.It's just a convenient place to have a hot bowl of ramen and that's about it
4
I'm not a self professed ramen expert but i can say that i've tried many ramen joints all across Singapore, HK & Japan to know enough and this is one of the better ramen restaurants out here. I have been both outlets and i must say the food and service standard is consistant although i have not tried any other dishes than the ramens. Two thumbs up for me
3
They serve normal ramen at about US$11 incl taxes and kazan (volcano) ramen at about US$14. The prices are quite normal in Singapore for ramen. When they were at Novena Sq, there wwas always a queue during peak hours. Inside, if feels claustrophobic at both Novena and Liang Court (slightly better) branches. What lets this place down is the soup - it just does not have the rich tonkotsu heartniness to it and instead of a full bodied flavoursome effect with every sip, it just tastes salty without the body I would expect with good tonkotsu broths
3
The latest branch to open at Liang Court, Tonkotsu Kazan serves up ramen that looks like a volcano with smoke coming out! But basically, the red funnel thing is purely aesthetic, and doesn't do anything to enhance the ramen flavours. Just looks cool for instagraming. The tonkotsu soup base is rich and flavourful, while the homemade ramen is pretty good. I find it weird that they serve the ramen kazan with RICE in addition to the ramen as well. It was carbs overload for me, and couldn't finish the staples. Nothing very spectacular here in terms of taste, patronize if you haven't eaten for 3 days and want loads of ramen for a good price. Whoever said this was the best Ramen in Singapore so far is clearly a pathological liar and needs to be checked out
