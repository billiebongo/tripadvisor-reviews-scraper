Huge disappointment! Friend was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 6th Nov 2017 @ 02:37 am. My name and mobile number is also in the patientâ€™s hospital Triage records.

The food was great and the interiors were of Chinese decorations with huge lanterns and comfortable to dine in. Really enjoy the tasty food which were well cooked before servings. The serving staff are well trained and helpful.

This was recommended by friends and the food did not disappoint.
Suckling pig, roast duck were very good. Char Siew was too sweet for most of us. The highlight was the Chicken in pig stomach soup.
Worth another visit.

Recommended by my brother. The food is very delicious especially the roast duck and bean curd. Their signature crocodile fin with plenty of collagen is amazing.

We ate here with a number of Singaporean ex-colleagues and their wives on our way through Singapore after a holiday in Borneo. The food is really good and interesting. It is very popular and was certainly full on the Saturday evening when we went. Highly recommended, if a bit off the beaten track

An old friend has been here before and assured me that the food is excellent. I have been to Singapore loads of time and have eaten mostly in restaurants within shopping malls which are invariably connected to an MRT station. This is a huge restaurant serving typical Chinese dishes with ample free parking. If you do not own a car, getting here may involve using a taxi, bus or uber as it is not near a MRT station.The menu is big and varied, and as my friend pointed out you can order "expensively or modestly" within the menu as they do have some high priced dishes. Notwithstanding the restaurant being surprisingly empty, every dish we ordered was good. The total bill was over 120 dollars which is pretty reasonable for 4 in Singapore, without alcohol

Visit Yummy Receipt with friend.This restaurant is not famous I just found during cycling, because location is inconvenient.Mainly targeted for family.Not suitable for one person.But provide set menu from 2 pax.Interior is old Chinese style good for some special day but bit noisy when I visit.We ordered set menu, food is nice except dessert.If you want to have a party it's nice because they have many tables and not cloudy.But I don't think it's worth come by taxi from city area

Located in industrial estate near a warehouse . Service is efficient and fast Not many customer at dinner , I presume it caters more for office workers at lunch time . Soup with shark meat is tasty . Big grouper fish in clay pot is overcook Vegetable is average Steam live prawn is ok as I prefer to have smaller size shrimps Unless in the area , it is not worth a deviation

Tucked in a industrial park area, at the ground floor of an industrial building, we happened to discover this restaurant by chance. The interior of the restaurant was also very chi-na, creating a different ambience from its surrounding outside.Recommended by friends, we ordered the roast pork belly, the signature lobster congee, chicken and pig stomach soup, and fried Kai Lan. The portion served was quite decent for 6 of us. The dishes are also very tasty, and we emptied the entire potion of lobster congee and pig stomach soup. The ingredients are very fresh and probably that's why the food are so tasty. The service staff were also very prompt in serving us with food, changing of plates as well as filling up our tea. Will patronize again next time

Yummy recipes is a great, classy restaurant located in an industrial building, in an industrisl area.Don't be deceived by its location! On the inside, the atmosphere, decor, and service will rival any high street establishment!Food is really good and authentic, with traditional dishes like braised pig trotters and pig stomach soup (advanced order required). Menu is not extensive, but everything is good.Reasonably priced too
