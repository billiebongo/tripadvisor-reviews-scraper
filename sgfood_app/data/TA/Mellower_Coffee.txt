The sweet rain coffee is definitely the signature here. They also have lots of creative drinks- we tried the rose coffee. Both taste good and love the coffee here. Would like to try normal latte or americano next time!

This coffee house is just across Bugis Juction and a great place for a business meeting or a fun time with friends over coffee. Its a 2 storeyed cafe and has multiple tables -each setup cosily for one's liking.Apart from your regular cup of latte, Mellower Coffee is famous mostly for its instragrammable coffee- Sweet Little Rain (Cotton candy dripping over hot cup of coffee like drops of rain) simulating a slight drizzle.This place also has a lot of Alcohol infused coffees and different other infused flavours which are very distinctive from other places- Ondeh Ondeh latter and rose latte were few of them.Absolutely loved the smooth texture of the hazelnut cappucino(additional 1$ for the hazelnut syrup) which costed me a total of 7$ for a good and huge cuppa of coffee.You wont be disappointed.:

The place is well laid out - tables not cramped near each other. Brightly lit and very near to Bugis Junction shopping mall and Bugis MRT. The drinks are ok - depending what you order. The Bailey's Misu Misu at almost $10 was pricey but there's hardly any taste of Bailey's, ice cubes were tad too large; which after melting diluted the coffee taste :(I had Mellower's Latte at another location in Singapore and it was good. The slice of Rainbow Cake was ok though I doubt I woud order it again.This place is good for business or social chatting. Just that the drinks are pricey - and stick to the hot drinks. Skip the cold drinks

The barista took great care to prepare the hot chocolate that I order. It was thick and rich and yummy. the service staff were excellent and patient to explain their products to us. Though the price is on the high side but the overall experience was pleasant and a good place to hang out with friends or with a book. Very spacious and for those who like space will love it. Air con a bit cold though.Overall, I would come again

Came here for a coffee after lunch this week. Prices are a little steep but presentation is good as is the ambience. My cappuccino was just a little too milky for my liking. If you don't mind it more milky and paying over $6 for a cappuccino is fine then this place may be ok.

Popped in for take away coffees. Price was a bit steep I thought, however have nothing else to compare it to as it was the first coffee in Singapore.Was good tasting, reasonably quick service, would probably go back again if I was in the are

Wow....i was simply blown away by the innovative and absolutely delish Ondeh Latte with its smooth creamy fragranr blend of coconut milk aromatic pandan flavour and as much of the expresso shot you wish to mix....the result...AWESOME!!!It is such a brilliant local Singaporean twist to a latte :)The ambience is lovely especially on a dreamy romantic rainy afternoon with its tall glass windows airy high ceiling and large space....cool vibes all around.I also tried their regular latte once which was so smooth and creamy....There are many coffee beans and blend variations there too and a selection of pastries.Of course one has to mention the award winning "Sweet Rain" with its oh-so-pretty cotton candy cloud fluff suspended over an expresso dripping its flavour and essence steadily into the expresso....hhmmm.A special mention to the polite helpful and friendly baristas everytime i have visited.Once i ordered a coffee drink which was too strong for my liking...i brought it back to the counter and was happy to pay for a anorhwr beverage but Qiew Qiew (sorry if i mispelt your name)....She happily changed it for me without any extra charge!!I was so touched by thw professionalism and servicIts smack next to Bugis Plus Mall as you come our of Bugis Junction MRT.Definitely my "Go-To" hip cafe in Singapore!!Cheers Guys

The cotton candy dropped on the edge which made the cup Super sticky and gross and it doesn't make the coffee sweeter...
The cashier got no smile and feel like half deaf...

Very modern, cool (temperature), trendy cafe near the busy Bugis shopping area.Coffee and food was among the best we had in Singapore, right up there with Brawn & Brains in Geylang.
5
Great place. Very beautiful interior with great coffee. I enjoyed the normal coffees. The decorated/hyped drinks may be an acquired taste and may be left to each person's taste.
Various types of seats. Nice place to chill and relax and enjoy company of friends.
5
From the usual to something a little different, they know how to please.
Not your usual high street coffee chain.
Highly recommended.

The best coffee (european style) we had in Singapore. Tried also their cold coffees and where quite impressed mainly with Ondeh x Latte
5
Superb coffee, clean, comfortable chairs curious about the no studying signs during certain hours, when it was obvious most of the clients were sitting at laptops and merrily writing away. We got the last table which was fine, but Wi-Fi access was a challenge and probably due to the students..

Mellower Coffee at Middle Road, Bugis is the flagship shop. The environment is cosy and good for chats. Inside you can sit on normal seats or cushions on the floor. Seating is generally spacious enough and they are decorated with a small vase with fresh flowers.We ordered Sweet Little Rain and Ondeh X Latte, 2 of 3 Mellower Signature. They look attractive and they taste fabulous. The coffee itself of Small Little Rain is smooth and full of nuts aroma. The marshmallow rain makes the whole thing appear romantic but won't sweeten the drink too much. The Ondeh drink is delicious and not too sweet. It is a good match with the espresso.It is a good place to spend hours in reading or chatting with friends

I am a repeat customer of Mellower Coffee. If there were a commission based structure for the number of times I have introduced friends, family, clients and vendors to this coffee area, I would have been a rich man. Unfortunately, there is no such scheme available. When I was first brought to Mellower, I was extremely skeptical. The amount of cafes popping up like mushrooms in Singapore that purport to have the "best coffee" seemed like hogwash to me. It definitely does not help that cafes seem to hire similarly-styled interior design companies to replicate the styles of Insta-friendly industrial looks. But of course, you would like to hear about how good the coffee is. I am no coffee connoisseur, that is a given. But the Latte and Flat White coffee blends there are mellow and smooth, which is how I usually like my coffees to be. I am told that truly good coffees rests just right on the tip of your tongue. The temperature of the coffee in room temperature is neither too hot, nor too cold. It slips down the throat easily, and has a slow hit that arises on hindsight. The coffee at Mellower inspires work to be done, while encouraging creativity. There is really nothing better than an artificially induced coolness, comfortable seating areas, coupled with creamy, buttery coffee. And that is how amazing the coffee is. Of course, I was also there for the high-speed WIFI and ample electrical plugs

We just stumbled onto this cafe, looking for wifi in the area. Then when we saw the menu, we were astounded. I am always one who will try the novelty or the specialty of the house. There was a coffee called Sweet Little Rain. A piece of cotton candy was placed hovering over expresso. The heat of the expresso melted the sugar in the cotton candy and it dropped into the expresso. A customer next to it said, I would never order it, but I want to take a picture. I'll probably never order it again, but it was fun to have it this one time. There were other interesting drinks there too. Also, very pleasant atmosphere and nice people.

After long walk in bugis street do shopping, need some caffeine fix. The cafe is eye catching, looks warm and comfy place, the seating and table is unique. They also sells coffee and the equipment, they're coffee beans roasted in Shanghai not locals. Tried single origin coffee, presentation was good but the taste is me
4
Need more seats. Can do away with bean bag areas on 2nd floor to allow more customers. Wasteful to let just 2 persons sit at window. Can have more food choices - speciality coffee infused food will be good.
4
The muffins where really good. The quality of the coffee the same. It was very clean and has a "hipster" atmosphere . Good for working place.
5
Stumbled upon this 2-level coffee place at Bugis as it looks really inviting from the outside. Great coffee, nice ambience and strong wifi, loved it that the cafe is centrally located too.
4
A lovely place to hang out, although the specialty coffees don't come cheap ($9.80 for the ondeh latte and Sweet Little Rain). Both make for spectacular photos though!
5
One of the better coffee gourmet shops in Singapore. Coffee service and options are great. They take their time but make it as you want. A little more training but still a great nice chill coffee place.
5
Love that it is within walking distance from the train station and Bugis shopping malls. There is not much selection when comes to the drinks and pastries. However the available drinks are great, especially the Ondeh Ondeh latte. The service crews are friendly and helpful. Love their smiles :)

Chanced upon this venue while exploring the Bugis precinct. The place was a blend of urban and industrial chic with wood, steel and concrete elements. The coffee was well executed by a team of young barista. We ordered a flat white and ice latte. The small serve of flat white had a rich crema patterned by a rosetta. It was smooth, sweet with aromatic mouthfeel. The latte was equally rich and undiluted by the ice. Only downside was the high prices with $5.80++ for a flat white being the lowest and the time taken to make a cup

We chanced upon this place at the traffic junction just when we were wondering where to go for good espresso. The cool, quiet & spacious provided a wonderful sense of tranquil, away from the heat & bustle outside. We like the seating arrangement. The different combination had a furniture showroom feel.The menu had signature coffee & standard flat whites to latte. The staff could not say what differentiates their signature from the standard. All she could say was "the coffee was the same & this is how Management decided on the price". I found out only later from the website that one of their signature - sweet little rain is an unique visual creation by Mellower Coffee√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Korean barista champion. It is a ball of cotton candy suspended above a cup of Americano. The steam from the java rises up to melt the sugary treat, which drips into the cup to sweeten it. Overall, the crew were young, inexperienced & not customer savvy. Service was raw & abrupt. We were happy with the taste, quality & presentation of the piccolo & lemongrass infused tea. Shall return to try other brews

Its always busy with a friendly crowd at night and so we chose to visit in the morning for breakfast. Ordered a decaf Macchiato and a chocolate muffin. At around 10am its very quiet, and we tok time to look around the displays. Not a coffee cnnoisseur so cannot comment - plus decafs are not touted as a benchmarking beverage. However the chocolate muffin was very rich and moist without being too sweet. However not too much selection of breakfast food , as I think it primarily caters to the night crowd who would likely fancy dessert. All in all a great place to hang out during the day with a good book and at night with a bunch of friends.

Only a few minutes walk away from our hotel we were excited to find this excellent place to stop for our morning coffees!Traveling through Asia we've realised that finding a good coffee spot can be like finding a needle in a haystack so we hung onto this one and came back three times, once for each day we stayed in Singapore. Having flat whites and piccolos my girlfriend and I were always incredibly happy with our coffees. Finding them at the right temperature with delicious crema. We loved the shop fitout, it was such a bright happy space that like the rest of Singapore was cleaned to perfection. The service was always with a smile, which only added to our experience. Thank you
