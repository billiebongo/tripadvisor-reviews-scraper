Came here after recommendations from relatives, was definitely not disappointed. Duck was great and the zhi char dishes (fish, bean sprouts etc) were excellent as well. Quite wallet friendly and overall, very impressed with this eatery! Hope it will not be too crowded next time!

Loves this authentic Cantonese. The chef owner is from HK thus reflecting the authenticity of its food. Value is superb and our family clamour for its dishes. Highly recommended.

Located along a smaller road, opposite the Sembawang Shopping Centre, this ~15 table Cantonese style restaurant, has one of the BEST roast duck, my duck-loving family have tried.It's crisp skin with its plump succulent 5-spice marinated meat goes well with their soup of the day as well as their fried calamari rings and stir fried vegetables.Do call ahead with a table & roast duck reservation as they run out of duck very early. They'll typically serve a half duck order for a family of 5 ... Unless you had previous patronage where u could prove u can finish a whole duck at one go :DParking around the landed property estate can also be trying, so try to make early reservation (about 5.30pm) to avoid the crowd.The owners can be a little grouchy & loud ... just bear with it & enjoy yr duck

One of the places I used to go a lot in the past but due to limited parking spaces did not visit for many years. By chance I went back again and realized they have a underground parking space now.The roast duck still taste as good and so is their other dishes. Nice comfort food which did not change after so many years

We first visited this small family restaurant in year 1998 when we moved to this neighbourhood, ever since, it's our weekend 'dining room'. We were here almost every week (except when they're closed or we're not in town), have almost the same dishes for the past 17 over years.Our favourites - daily soup (authentic Cantonese soup) 例汤, roasted duck烧鸭， roasted pork烧肉, 'cha shu'叉烧 steamed eggs, sweet and sour pork, 'Chinese spinach with 3 types of eggs' 金銀旦苋菜, steamed fish and tofu dishes. We were here last Friday for the CNY specials -'Braised Dried Oyster, Mushrooms with “Fa Cai” and Vegetables' 蚝市发菜 and Yusheng 鱼生, in addition to the usual items, Sadly the oyster was sold out and we made an early reservation of the dish for our visit this coming Saturday.Over the years, this place is getting crowded and reservation is advisable. We always reserve the duck too when we call and if roasted pork is on the menu that day, 2 portions of pork with 1 portion of duck. we always get the duck drumstick. They don't charge GST or service charge but since it's always busy, be patient and be rewarded with super tasty food. This place is gaining my foreign friends' liking too, so whenever they're in town, they always request for Uncle Sum although we brought them to other posh restaurants with fancy food including those highly raved here at TripAdvisor before. One ethnic group? No, they are Malaysian Chineses, Germans, Americans, Canadian and Australian. No boundary when come to good food

Went with family when in Singapore - it is a regular haunt for relatives so was happy to try it out. It was a really popular place so though we made a reservation, we had to wait sometime for our seat which gave us sometime to consider what to order. We ordered a number of dishes - soup (meat and gourd?), spinach in 3 types of egg, a veg dish (think was kailan, not sure), fish, roast duck, mince and salted fish and yong tau fu. Most of the dishes were delicious, I really liked the veg dishes. The roast duck was tasty but a bit fatty - we have had better near Zion Road. The fish was average and tasted slightly overcooked and the yong tau fu was also nothing to shout about. I love the ginger and spring onion dip which you can add to most of your dishes to liven things up - I could have had it with plain rice!! Overall the food is good though we were a bit hit and miss with the dishes this time. I can see why my relatives love going back time after time

This casual resturant served the most authentic and no non-sense Hong Kong dishes in Singapore. Their must-try is Roast Duck, which is so popular that you have to pre-order. The duck is huge and non-fatty, and the skin is roasted to perfect crispiness with five spice seasoning ($20 for half duck). Every Friday they will service the fantastic roasted pork, which you will come back for more! Beside their mouth-watering roast, other specialities are steamed Goby, fish head, You Mai (a special vegetable that is very popular in Hong Kong), steam minced meat with salted fish, steamed chicken and 30 other dishes for a satisfying home-cooked lunch or dinner. Less than S$25 per head for a real great meal. The only challenge is their remote location from town

I'm not a duck lover but my family loves their roast duck. The first time I brought my family there for dinner, they only had a quarter of the duck to serve us and my 7 year old son cried when there was none left on the plate when he lost to the quick action of his older siblings. The kitchen staff was kind to offer my son the duck necks and he happily chewed on them. They normally keep the duck necks to make soup stock. This second time I brought my family, I pre-ordered a whole duck and it was all devoured and everybody was satisfied this time and there was enough so there was no fighting over duck this time. Even though I made reservations on these 2 occasions, we ended up waiting for about 20 minutes but at least they kept the duck we reserved
