If you are into hard to find but ultra delicious Yakitori, look no further than this quaint, unkempt, unassuming restaurant on the third floor of Orchard Plaza. You can try and if you are lucky enough to get a booking, make sure not to cancel it. The yakitori are done to perfection and a must order is the raw chicken liver and chicken gizzard. The chicken broth is sharp and made so clear, it helps wash down the food at the end of the meal.

My Friend said this place serves the best chicken skewers in town. So we came. And indeed we were not disappointed. In fact, super delighted with the assortment of chicken skewers from meat to neck to liver. Every skewer was tender, flavourful and cooked perfectly. While the place is nothing to shout about, I love the smokiness that adds to the attractive skewers. It's nice with the Chef interacting with the guests, makes the experience even better and almost Omakase style! The sake selection here is ok, well...not as good as desirable but the food makes up for the most part
