Love the matcha lava cake, it doesn't taste too sweet üòç. The lemon is covered wuth white chocolate with a sour taste that gives a fresh sensation.
5
So this place is a little off the normal tourist route but its so much fun! The dessert is instantgram worthy. Tastes pretty good as well. Only wished they opened for longer hours.
5
From their Bak Chor Mee to their Ike, from Avalanche to Broken Pot de Fleur, super instagram worthy presentation and a good experiment with flavours that compliments each other. Kudos!

Feels so cozy and relaxing, good atmosphere, positive vibe, friendly staffs, unique desserts as well as various of interesting and yummy ice cream üòçüç¶ It has ice cream in Gula Melaka, Kaya Toast, Horchick, White Rabbit flavours!! To die for, highly recommended!
5
The place is cozy and comfortable.
Suitable for family with kids. Only serve dessert. The waffle is very good. Good choices of ice-cream.

Made it here for a belated birthday surprise Was kinda cool, the desserts were cute but small for the price The menu had quite a few items missing which I wanted to try Will go back just to see if they have the full menu next time

My family adjourned to this dessert place after our seafood dinner on opposite side of Rangoon Road. Both the kids and adults have enjoyed all these creative dishes that filled us with delightful surprises.We ordered 5 desserts and our unaminously agreed top choice is the chocolate avalanche where the lava flows out like volcano eruption upon breaking by us.The rubber ducky looks so real with taste of refreshing mango smoothie. Another awesome design is the Pot de Fleur (meaning flower pot in French) so craftly made with a crack at one side of pot.The Pear cake is also easily mistaken as real pear and has taste of pear in the interior coated with chocolate and matcha coat.The limited National Day edition is nasi lemak which caters for local flavours decorated with real ikan bilis and peanuts

Decided to give it a try after dinner. Reach around 7pm when it was quite empty (not for Long - the crowd and queue came in around 8/9pm) The design of the cafe felt abit like a criss over between a safari theme and a modern coffee house design. Quite unique and easy on the eyes.Ordered the Chocolate Avalanche and the Rubber Ducky.The Rubber ducking was a duck shape sorbet served on Top a mango pudding and sago pearls. The design was absolutely amazing and detailed. It really looked exactly like a Rubber duck in a bathtub. The sorbet sour taste and the sweet mango pudding was great and refreshing. Abit on the sweet side though but still overall a good dessert.The one that wins it all and made its way into my top 3 ever Favourite dessert is the Chocolate avalanche. The mix between the hot chocolate fudge cake, the vanilla ice cream and crunchy almond biscuit just blends so well tgt providing the contrast in texture and taste. I licked the bowl clean of the last drop of chocolate and cake. Pls go and try it for yourself. You will not regret.

This place is great for fancy desserts so best for friends gathering or dates. They come up with new stuff every now and then to wow customers, so do ask for the 'special' when you arrive at the shop. On my recent visit, we had the Lava dessert and some ice creams. They were really nice!The place is spacious and comfortable, so it is good for large group or family as well
5
As a tourist, finding this place would be a bit difficult. Luckily I had a local train. From Marina Parade we change two buses to reach here (I forgot the bus number), and I have walk about 10min to this small cafe.First the design was rustic and creative, it was clean and spacious. They were many youngsters/couples around. The prices are about medium-high range for desserts (for a simple working person like me, and they only serve desserts btw), and they only accept cash. So, bring yo cash.And then the desserts. It was so beautiful you almost don't wanna mess with it. It taste as good as it looks. I enjoyed all the 4 desserts that we ordered. Totally worth it
5
2nd time here. Great place for desserts. Delicious kaya gelato and cakes. Very attractive and great Taste. Must visit
5
I visit here every Singapore trip, and I am always blown away with the flavours and creativeness I find. I can't begin to tell you how amazing this Dessert Cafe is. I would start with the Matcha or Chocolate Avalanche.
3
Fun place to have desserts, particularly the Singapore food-inspired ones. Tends to be on the sweet size with artificial flavors and colors. Get pass the gimmicky parts and there are some real skills involved. Overall, creative and light hearted desserts. Take fun !
4
Local creativity at its best! Tried most things on the menu, which I wouldn't recommend unless you're ready for sugar rush. Everything here is sweet, so make your choice wisely.
5
This place is a gem! They make the most amazing looking desserts and they taste really good. Those of you who are well travelled and spend more than they should might recognized desserts inspired by Cedric Grolet of the renowned Parisian Hotel, Le Meurice. It might not be 3-star Michelin standard but still, non entree serves some of the best desserts in town. They are a little pricy but if you consider the hours gone into each piece, the prices are not exaggerated. Warning - credit cards are not accepted, cash and nets only
5
I came for the "bak cho mee" desert but was told by staff that they have change theme and more "greenery" dessert. I ordered 2 of the recommended, Sunny and Pot de Fleur. It's actually quite nice and it blow my mind away, kudos to the chef. Looking forward for more and will definitely come again. I ended up ordered another gula Melaka ice cream waffles before I leave.
4
Visited: with a friendExpected: many deserts+++ (PROS)colorful place, slightly artsy/ nostalgicvery friendly girls as staff, running around all the time- - - (CONS)very few standards in place; looks that they have no rules with service; nobody gets your plate once it's empty, staff might be on the phone behind the counter; staff might just talk around between each other; don't get me wrong, they're friendly... but unprofessional the place looks cozy but it's so cold inside; maybe that's how Singaporeans like it; the windows are all blurry like it's Christmas; if so they should offer some presents...Bottom line: a good place to experience; it's very good for a neighborhood cafe; but can be way bette

The place was located quite a walking distance from the MRT station. Retro theme desserts and cakes will be available till end of the month.Singapore Breakfast (S$13.90++) Coconut panna cotta "soft boiled egg " with bursting exotic yolk,top with gula melaka "soy sauce" & cinnamon "pepper power" & kaya parfait toast on the sideTopup S$4++ for a cup of white coffee to go with itSuper light crispy toast. It was like having the usual kaya toast but icy cold version. The yolk tasted of pineapple.The flat white was average in taste, as I preferred it to be stronger.Gem Biscuit (S$10.90++)Milk Chocolate, Apricot, AlmondIt was light mousse with apricot filling, topped with meringue.Tu Tu Kueh (S$8.90++)Coconut Vanilla, Gula Melaka, AlmondIt was a giant version of the actual stuff with gula melaka filling. Best come early. The place packed up quite fast
4
The cafe is quite small and packed when I arrived with friends on a Saturday night at about 8pm. Fortunately we were first in the queue and managed to get a table within 10 minutes. Very chill atmosphere - definitely a nice place for a casual catch up with friends over dessert and coffee. They have themed desserts which is really unique and interesting. I ordered the "bak chor mee" which really looked the actual thing! The taste was not bad, a bit sweet as they used a lot of mango in the dessert but still ok as the portion isn't huge. Will be back to try the Singapore breakfast next :)
5
Interesting desserts in the form of Singapore famous and traditional food (e.g. egg and toast, ang ku kueh, tu tu kueh, bak chor mee) and look pretty much like the real thing. Cafe is pretty spacious with quite some tables. Located in an old neighbourhood estate with a famous bakuteh stall right beside making it a good choice before or after dessert. Could take a bus or grab a cab from Cityhall which is pretty convenient. Waited for ~45mins. Staff are young and friendly and the cafe is cozy.Tried the Ang ku kueh, bak chor mee, The Giving Tree and a scope of rabbit candy ice-cream. Personally love the bak chor mee (noodles is made of mango) while 3 other friends prefer the Giving Tree with a slight alcohol taste. Worth the trip and enjoyed the experience. Recommend. :

Friends took us to this dessert outlet to surprise us with the most unexpected dessert. Among all , my fav was the Singapore Breakfast Set, the boiled egg was made of chocolates coated with pinacotta & passionfruit! Def will revisit again!
5
The place was nice and cute, the ambience fun. It's a 10 min walk from Farrer Park MRT station, but totally worth it. The desserts were very delicious and their presentation was out of the world, loved the place.
4
This is a great addition to the Singapore dessert scene. A very creative dessert chef (try the chocolate avalanche - their version of chocolate lava cake) who has a new spin on old favorites. Nice decor and service. A bit pricey though.
5
I stumbled upon this cafe when a good friend casually mentioned it. It is located at Rangoon Road. The cafe is only 2 shop houses from the famous 'Ng Ah Sio' Bak Kut Teh shop. You can enjoy your dessert in the form of famous local cuisines such as Ang Ku Kueh, Tu Tu Kueh and Bak Chor Mee.
4
In Rangoon road, right at the end, it is a good discovery. Good presentation of the dessert. Good Interpretation of local SG culture into desserts in the "French art".I am interested to see how the desert will stay creative and be renewed. Ice creams are very good. The lemon desert is fantastic. Price is a bit high when you think you can get high end p√¢tisserie for 10-12 sgd in places like pantler in the CBD. In non entr√©e, you will pay 15 SGD minimum. I know patisserie is a lot of work.... but still ! Again like 99% of restaurant in singapore, the acoustic of the space is terrible.
4
Visited this cafe for 3times. Need not to elaborate further. The lava cake is the boom, must try match flavour (which is all time in menu). Previously Ive tried the horlick lava version, but they ceased this dessert. I hope they gonna bring back. Chocolate was normal. Cosy place for chitchatting and slacking
5
I've tried a few items on their menu but nothing really stands out more than what looks like a rubber duck in a bubble bath. Great balance of flavours and textures in that dish with chewy translucent balls at the bottom to the iciness of the duck sorbet and light lemongrass foam. The chocolate/matcha avalanche was a little too rich for me but really good for social media posts. They offer gelatos in many flavours too including local favourites such as milo and kaya.
4
This is a pretty unique dessert shop. It‚Äôs a dessert place that will blow your mind. The dishes looked like local fares, like Roti Bakar with Eggs, but have a taste and what you see is not what you get. The food are desserts! It‚Äôs hard to describe but its sure is interesting.The shop decor is filled with nostalgia and exudes a certain old school charm
5
Non Entr√©e is well-known for it's creative desserts and people flock there to get that Instagram-worthy shot. I work nearby so I wanted to review if the desserts are as good as they look. The typical dessert-looking are perfect as they look good and tastes a few times better than they look. The thing that blew my mind was that they had desserts that are made to look like old coffee shop breakfast savouries.I had the eggs with toast (pictured below) and everything looked like the real thing. The breaking of the egg shell, the consistency of the egg white, they way the yolk is textured. It was the best work of any pastry chefs that I've tried so far. I would not describe it here as it does not do justice. To summarise it, each part has its own taste, flavour and texture; they complemented each other very well
5
Tucked away in a quaint neighbourhood, this hidden gem offers the most creative take on desserts in town. Local dishes and snacks are transformed into artfully presented desserts that will make you want to skip the main courses and head right here. They offer seasonal specials and new creations every now and then, so do check back often
4
The desserts served are all creative and delicious! Some of the famous common Singapore food turned desserts can be found. Definitely worth visiting again!
3
The desserts weren't fantastic, probably good enough to have them on instagram or snapchat. The service was average and the price was quite expensive.

The only "Bak Chor Mee" i like in Singapore !!!! It is sooooo special and delicious !!!!!
„ÄåPs. A best place for people who like to take photos„Äç

For people who are looking for something different, yet getting same satisfaction from your deserts. Kudos for coming up with creations that is beyond gastronomic.
5
The desserts are outstanding. I've never seen or taste anything like this before. Very talented, innovative and creative chefs. Tried the Bak Chor Mee and rubber ducky. Both were delicious and visually attractive . Thank you.

My friends recommended this place and we were intrigued by the artisan dessert replicas of Singaporean cuisines. This dessert place is just a few shops away from the famous Ng Ah Sio Bah Ku Teh store at Rangoon road. We visited the shop on a busy Saturday night at 9pm and waited for approximately 20 minutes before we had seats. It was a packed shop and several popular desserts such as the Tu Tu Kueh and Singapore breakfast were sold out. If you want to try their popular desserts, try visiting the store earlier in the day. We ordered the Ang Ku Kueh, Bar Chor Mee and pandan waffles topped with white rabbit and kaya toast ice cream. The Ang Ku Kueh and Bar Chor Mee looked highly delicate and instagramable, but unfortunately the taste of both desserts didn't match up to its looks. The Ang Ku Kueh was a tad too sweet with its strawberry jam, while the Bar Chor Mee had too many contesting ingredients (cookies, sea coconut, sesame powder, mango vermicelli - just to name a few) that resulted a weird concoction of tastes. Surprisingly, the pandan waffles, though traditional and the least photogenic of the lot, turned out to be the most enjoyable dessert! This was especially so when the waffle was paired with the local-inspired ice cream flavours white rabbit sweet and kaya toast! Therefore, the (cliched) moral of the story: don't be deceived by one's looks!
5
We stumbled across this place on a Google search. They do the most delicious matcha lava cake and pandan pancakes. The store is quirky and fun. If you're after dessert definitely recommend this place. The cost is about the same as a full meal but the portion sizes are generous enough you could share one dessert. The ginger and tropical float drink was really refreshing in the heat.

Interesting and special concept desserts among the cafe scene. Instagram worthy but mediocre taste. Prices on the high side. What surprised me the most is that they charged service charge!!! What service did they provide when I need to get my own spoon when I asked for an extra set from the server?! And the table next to me need to go to the front to get their own water! Take note that we had to order ourselves at the cashier.Ok to try once but once is more than enough.
4
Beware this place is very popular so you gotta queue.There is a ERP URA car park off Owen Road if you can't find car park on Rangoon Road.The desserts resemble common daily food e.g. "Ang Ku Kueh", "Bak Chor Mee" and Singapore breakfast comprising boiled eggs and toast with butter. The creative desserts taste good but they are not as refined as you will get in a top restaurant, understandably.There is a bit of wait for the special desserts. I waited 35 minutes for Singapore breakfast
4
Finally after 2 failed attempts to try this place I got to taste the Matcha Avalanche. Heaven! We also ordered the Drunken babe, infused with whiskey, bacon crisp and popcorn...it was so good. The excellent pastry on display was too good to be eaten and the choice of specialty gelato was different from the others. A must go to place for dessert especially after a round of the famous pork rib soup meal next door. Will be back soon
5
Wish I had 3 stomaches so that I could go 3 times per day. Delicious and innovative desserts. Not too expensive and interesting decor.
5
Very good. The chocolate lava cake is a must. The caf√© is located in some distance to Little India. We took the bus to get there.
5
Really wonderful place for fulfil sweet cravings. Nothin that I can find fault with. It may not be the most accessible place but it is definitely worth the walk.
5
We went there after work and got lucly to get a table right away (2mins later the place was crowded). Its a bit pricy but the avalanche cake is to die for! We tried some ice cream as well and I can recommend everything they offer even though I could not try all of the goodies. I will definitely visit again! Totally worth the money!
5
I visited the dessert shop with my beau last August 2 during the afternoon. We ordered the Matcha Avalanche, and the Pick Me Up. The presentations for both desserts were spot-on beautiful. They were a feast to our eyes. The taste also delivered, delicious ! The texture to their pastry, gelato, cakes, foams, and cream are balanced as well. Please see my ratings here:Dessert Presentation - 5Dessert Taste - 5Ambiance (cozy, sturdy tables, well decorated) - 5Staff (helpful, approachable, polite) - 5Availability of menu items - 5Availability of service water, tissue, clean utensils -

The desserts here are simply awesome. Every dessert I've tried comes very well plated, pretty and yummy. They are all worth trying at least once! A little pricey but well worth for the great presentation and flavors.If you prefer something a little filling, go with the waffles and ice cream. They have a couple of local choices like kaya toast and gula melaka ice cream.Location wise, it is a short walk from Farrer Park station. Be prepared to queue if you are heading over around dinner time or after. Advise to catch odd hours to avoid long wait
5
Was dining at Ng Ah Sio Bak Kut Teh just beside this dessert cafe and decided to give it a try. No regrets. Sparkling Ice Lemon Tea was very refreshing, Coffee Gelato was extremely flavorful - Coffee lovers would like this, and the Chocolate Avalanche was a perfect artisan dessert. Highly recommended!
4
This place is a bit of a search if you are taking public transport as it is right at the end of Rangoon Road and quite a walk from the nearest MRT station.Average prices of desserts from menus is close to $15 and the cakes from the counter are $10-12.the prices seem reasonable if you share the desserts though.Restaurant decor is pleasant but there aren't much seating as whole floor space is not maximised to accomodate more people and there is a tendency for all guests/customers to sit for extended periods here, so you need to be prepared to wait for a seat at peak hour
5
This is a popular place so do expect to wait to be seated. We were there at about 9pm and had to wait 40mins but we found it worth it! Everyone at this place is proud of their desserts and would readily offer more information about each one of them. We could tell that they put a lot of thought into coming up with each dessert! We had the (i) Chocolate Avalanche (there is a Matcha Avalanche available too), (ii) Rubber Ducky, (iii) Drunken Babe, and (iv) La Rose! All of them are instagram worthy! I would highly recommend Chocolate Avalanche as it comes with orange-infused Vanilla icecream.... the taste of chocolate + orange is simply delightful! Rubber Ducky tastes very refreshing and I like it a lot too! :) We took a cab there but if you plan to head over by train, Farrer Park MRT station is a short 5-10mins walk away! Honestly, there are many places which serves nice desserts but perhaps none of the other places are as thoughtful! This place is certainly worth a visit
5
It was a long 10 minute walk under the hot sun from Farrer Park MRT to the cafe. BUT it was well worth it. The place was crowded but fortunately we were lucky to get a seat for six. The Le Citron we had, featured lemon sorbet encased in a chocolate shell. It was refreshing and the bed of crumbles, edible flowers and meringue etc made it all visually appealing. The Matcha Avalanche was my favourite with an instagram-worthy and droolsome dessert with flowing matcha and azuki beans into a fishbowl-looking platform. Together with the roasted green tea ice cream, it was divine. Even the waffles was no letdown, with its crispy light crust and sinful tiramisu and peanut butter ice cream! This is definitely worth a visit or more
