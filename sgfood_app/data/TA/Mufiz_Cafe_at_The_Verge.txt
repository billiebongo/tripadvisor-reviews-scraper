We can Get coin parotta, Biriyani, fried rice, Nasi Lamak etc plus halal meat.There are also cool drinks, different teas.The best part is good value for money. Despite being located by the Serangoon road, opposite to Rochor SMRT station at the ground floor of The Verge shopping mall, the rate of food items are comparable to those in Tekka center but the cafÃ© is air conditioned (unlike those at Tekka center) neat and tidy and cool.We loved this.It is open from 8:30 am in the morning to late in the night. we saw it open till 11 pm in the night
