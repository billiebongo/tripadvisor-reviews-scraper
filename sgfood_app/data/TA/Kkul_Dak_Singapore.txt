Tried this Kkal Dak for the first time. Was captivated by this unique name and catchy menu screen. Ordered the Honey Chicken Ball and Japchae. Japchae is a Korean dish made from sweet potato noodles (called dangmyeon, Korean: 당면), stir fried in sesame oil with vegetables (typically thinly sliced carrots, onion, spinach, and mushrooms), sometimes served with beef, and flavoured with soy sauce, and sweetened with sugar. It is usually served garnished with sesame seeds and slivers of chili. It may be served hot or cold.The Japchae is so flavorful! Can taste the aromatic sesame oil soaked up by the springy noodles. And the ingredients are fresh. Very satisfying! Tastes very authentic Korean taste! Portion just nice for 1 as dinner. Would be back again

There are many Korean restaurants or places selling Korean-styled fried chicken. Most of them are average, or overpriced. If you are looking for a simple snack and/or meal, try the honey chicken at Kkul Dak located at Plaza Singapura.Personally I prefer the spicy version...the variety is good with many different side dishes or bento box sets too

After a disappointing lunch at another restaurant, I stumbled upon this little Korean stall specialising in Honey Chicken. I tried the a Honey Chicken which was nice and the Honey Chilli Chicken which was very nice. It makes a good fast food style Korean snack.This stall is among a few other Korean stalls in a cluster in the middle of basement 2 at Plaza Singapura
