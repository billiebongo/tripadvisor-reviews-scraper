Staff are friendly. Seafood and zi char dishes are nicely done but still less pricey than those well-known big resto
3
Nice crab bee hoon, always here for the crab bee hoon, flavorful soup from the crab and you can refill it for twice too!
4
It was a good dining experience at Jelly Jie Seafood. Staff were courteous and service prompt. Professionalism was displayed too in the way that the staff recommended dishes. Will definitely visit again for the good food and great dining experience !
3
My family went there for dinner to celebrate my father’s birthday. The food is reasonable, but a bit pricey as the place is not air-conditioned. The service is good as the staff is very friendly and helpful.
5
For small party up to 5 people, this is a great place to share their love of CRAB, comes in all tastes and styles. The veg selection is great also. Something for everybody.
5
Do try the salted egg lollipops which are actually salted egg drumsticks beside their crabs. That is our favourite.
5
Make a reservation through Chope. We did not need to wait for a long time. When we arrived at the restaurant, we ordered the food immediately. We have a great meal at that night.
1
The restaurant was not as full as I expected, however, there was still a queue. The restaurant decided to hold reservations and walk-ins at the same small stand where there is no clear differentiation between both. We had to place our orders at the little stand; by doing so, we were not able to take a proper look at the menu to place our orders. Being our first time there, the waitress did not recommend any of the more popular dishes, instead, she just stood there tapping her pen on the stand irritated while we decide what to order. There were not many people, couldn't the staff show us to our tables and let us decide what we would like to have at the table itself like all the other restaurants? We wanted to order 2 crabs, the butter crab and the chilli crab. However, the irritated waitress told us that there was only one crab left. At 630pm on a Sunday night, the restaurant only had one crab left? She didn't bother to explain why; was it only one crab per table? Was it because we had to pre-order the crabs beforehand? I guess we will never know. The portions of the food were ridiculously small with an equally ridiculously big price tag. The food was just subpar; you can find the same dishes at other tze char stores which will taste much better at a much lower price.100% not going back to this place and 100% would not recommend to anyone
4
Went there on a Sat night with a reservation and was given a table on the second floor with air-conditioning. Ordered 4 crabs: crab beehoon, butter crab, chilli crab and white pepper crab. The crabs were fresh and well-cooked. I personally like the crab beehoon, which came in a thick fragrant broth, and the butter crab, which was really appetising. The other two were so-so.
4
This place used to be called Mellben Seafood, not sure what prompted the re-branding, so long as the food quality remained the same or got even better!This was our second visit actually and in first, we had tried the Braised Crab Bee Hoon and various other dishes. This time, we were back to try the other crab dishes and had the Creamy Butter Crab and Chilli Crab! The crabs cost us a bomb, but they were oh so worth it and finger-licking good! We also enjoyed dipping the man tou (steamed buns) into and polishing off the tasty gravy
4
Very good seafood restaurant specialised in crab.....
This restaurant is surrounded by Hawker so the atmosphere is but hustle and bustle.
Very expensive and i felt over priced!
4
Dinner with family, food was good and environment was clean. Good valie with choope pre-purchase vouchers
2
Crab was more expensive than downtown. A dish of vegetable cost SGD25? No air conditioning. I would rather go to hawker market.
4
We made a reservation via chope and bought vouchers online beforehand. We ordered and was shown to our seats and the food is served shortly after. Service was great! Crab beehoon soup was not as nice as Melben's one but the chilli crab is fantastic!!!
5
Been here multiple times, their bihun crab always satisfy my crab craving.. Price a bit high but it's worthed, tough it'll be best if they can provide aircon restaurant
5
Food and service is of excellent quality and standard. Definitely a must visit for all locals and visitors in Singapore. Good for family and friends. The best place for all kinds of crab dishes but the crab soup is a must try.
5
Great cooking. Very delicious crab especially the crab cook with rice noodles. All my friends love it. Will go with friends again.
5
Overall a great experience... Order 2 crabs - Chilli and Creamy + 2 Vege and 1 Truffle loin Pork Chop.
Feel a little pricy but the Crab was BIG and fresh. Although the chilli crab a little too watery. Will visit again next time.
3
The chili crab is good. Was given one full of roe. Delicious! The crab bee hoon soup was rich with flavor but I think at the expense of the crab coz it was a tad over cook. But still a good dish. The sweet and sour sliced fish was nice. Lightly crisped and the meat was sweet. Good meal. Will return.
5
Crabs definitely stole the show. We ordered a chilli and a creamy butter crab, which were both really fresh and meaty. Creamy butter crab was the highlight of the night for sure, similar to the original Mellben ones. Service staff were outstanding too. Will be back
4
Enjoy a fantastic dinner with family. Chili crab and yam scallop were yummy. Children loved the Chilli gravy very much. Will definitely recommend to friends.
5
Went on a Saturday night. Place wasn't overly crowded and we were comfortably seated in the air-cond section. Food was good (especially the crab bee hoon) and wasn't too expensive (compared to some other 'name brand' places). Will definitely return for special occasions.
5
Food are very delicious with efficient staffs. 4 of us have over ordered our food but we've finished it all as it's too delicious.
3
Their signature is their bee hoon crab, creamy butter crab.
The salted egg french bean also quite tasteless.
4
Food so-so, former mellben or AMK one taste better. But at least I went about 3+pm is still open. staff is friendly and attentive. But environment is a bit hot, no aircon and insuffient fans. Was sweating.
4
The food was great and most items were priced fairly. I think the Chilli crab they served was marvelous. Worth trying.
5
On our recent trip to Singapore we were introduced to Kelly's restaurant and it was excellent! The seafood is delicious and I highly recommend the crab bee hoon. In our opinion, this is one of the best seafood restaurants in Singapore, and it even surpasses Long Beach and Jumbo. The staff are efficient and attentive and the food was served promptly. It is best to book in advance as most of the time there is quite a long queue
3
Be prepared to have to wait to be seated even if you had booked a table. Be sure to sit at the ground floor level or alfresco, as the Airconditioned dining room upstairs is small, poorly ventilated, supernoisy, and impossible to enjoy social conversations. My ears were badly traumatised throughout dinner, and my clothes and hair smelt of crab sauces n all other dishes. The Long beans with salted egg yolk suffered from it's crust being too firm, and the beans not young enough. The Crabs in claypot was excellent, the crab with creamy custard was delicious, the homemade tofu with sauce was good, but avoid the Pork ribs in 3 ways. The mee taimak was delicious, we gave it top marks, with good wok-hei fragrance! The Yam with seafood was creative and delicious, filled with fish and vegetables.
3
We were assigned a table on the 2nd floor. it was very noisy even though it was not packed. The ceiling was low and the noise were not dispersed. With kids talking around, we were not able to hold proper conversation across the 12 seater table.Food was good, but service not so. The bowls and lader was not served together with the Crab Bee Hoon. As it is the signature dish, i would expect the waiters to know what needs to be served together. we were there at 6pm, so the restaurant was not so busy or packed then.Overall not a pleasant experience.
5
We were well-received by the staff and really appreciated that Kelly was on hand to help in the service. She engaged us in conversation and was obviously very well-versed with the restaurant's dishes as she helped us in deciding what to order. The food was well-prepared and served by staff who were proud of their restaurant. All in all, a very pleasant and enjoyable evening
5
The food was great. Ordered crabs and the meat was cooked very well. The sauce for the craps were very good also
3
Overall pleasant experience. But it will be better if they used bigger crab. The rest of the dishes tasted quite good too.
3
Crab noodles with 1 crab slightly above ave size cost $68.00 which is expensive. The crab is fresh. The pork ribs n cereals prawns are good.
3
Our expectation was pretty high for the salted egg crab and chilli crab as we were recommended to try the seafood at this restaurant by a friend. The crabs were fresh. However the sauces were not as tasty as what I expected. Guinness Stout pork rib was quite yummy. The service was prompt and pretty good.
5
This place was recommended to us by a friend living in Singapore and it didn't disappoint. It was about a 15 minute cab ride from downtown Singapore but worth it.The service was excellent and the food delicious - particularly the big chili crab and ribs
5
Very quick to serve. Using the chope option made the processes very clear. Booking process was the best part because the restaurant only opens at 5pm and I could book at 11am. The servers were quick , not super good service but they were super quick to respond. Food was excellent as per usual. My ang moh friend loved the crabs and ribs !
3
We had to make our orders while standing outside before we are brought to our tables as they mentioned that there were insufficient staffs on the 2nd floor to take orders. And it is so cramp that there is no space for us to pull our chairs when we were brought to our seats. The other table's customers had to get up and let us sit before they may continue their dining. Overall, was an above average price for average dining experience.
3
This is not the 1st time I went after it re-branded. I know it is not cheap but I still shocked on the price with $80++ per kg for the crab. It is ways too expensive and so we decided to order other dishes and probably ended with the same price. Got one noodles, prawn, ribs and vege. The salted egg long bean quite tasteless although with salted egg, i expected it to be more flavorful. The rest are still ok
5
The claypot crab bee hoon was nice and creamy. We ordered a bigger crab and it was tender and juicy.The other dishes were nicely cooked and to the point. The service was quick and food was served fast and hot. Good for big groups as well
5
Dinner at Kelly Jie's is a MUST for me on my trips to Singapore.Kelly serves up the BEST Butter Crab, Fried Rice, Cereal Prawns, Bean Curd Skin with vegetables etc in Singapore. I have tried many different dishes here and they are all excellent. On my latest visit there Kelly had an excellent new dish, Pork with White Truffles. Just awesome!It is also off the beaten tourist path and this is a favourite place for locals
4
The food overall is good and fresh. Personally recommend truffles pork loin. The mango roll is below my expectations.
5
Crabs is solid fresh and tasty. Order both chili and cream butter ones! Taste was awesome! Service was good and food was so fast! Given FREE desserts too!!!
3
Overall food taste was average. As there is no Aircon so it as abit warm. Service wise was quite prompt.
4
Crabs and the buns nicest. Vege quite nice. Dou fu normal taste not rich enough.sweet & sour pork tasty but only few pieces( quantity
5
Good seafood although pricey. Quick in serving food, most dishes served in about 10-15 minutes after ordering. Crab dish came within 30minutes. Creamy butter crab and salted egg crab was great!
4
Prices were not as competitive as other seafood restaurants do offer similar kind of prices. Portion of food was good enough for 4 persons though. Good experience I would said.
2
Went there on 31 Aug to celebrate my mum birthday. We had a poor seating. Food was ok but overpriced. Not going back again
4
The crab is tasty and the pricing is reasonable. The scallops with broccoli is not worth it. Bland. All other dishes is quite ok
2
Technology is already there why still want us to print out chope coupon which we have purchased? Dont understand the logic behind.
5
Consistently fabulous even though I have not been here for more than 1 year. Brought my guest from Indonesia and they enjoyed the Chili Crab and Crab Bee Hoon and other dishes. They wish only if it's available in Jakarta. Now that they know where it's located they are bringing their friends and families when they visit Singapore again. Keep up the fabulous food.
3
We dont get the system of making online reservations yet still have to queue when we reach there.
in any case, the food were nice but a tad too expensive. there were pretty strict about outside food and drinks too.
3
Chilli Crab sauce is way too sweet even though I've seen teview that it is not.
Generally prices for most items have seen an increase.
3
seated upstairs in the "air conditioned" room but the room is very warm. should have seated in the open air area (al fresco style) where at least, there is some natural breeze. my swiss guest commented if the air conditioning was spoilt.
5
Awesome service and food as usual . Recommend the lollipop chicken !
Pls have proper signage / line to ensure better manage of queue.
4
This place is recently changed its name to Kelly Jie Seafood. It was our first visit, despite staying in Toa Payoh for the past 3 years. The seafood dishes were all awesome, particular the crab which was finger-licking good!
4
The food was excellent but the portion was not a lot and the crab was expensive basing that the food place is actually at a normal shop.
4
The dishes we ordered were delivered in good time and we didn't have to wait long in between dishes. We were accommodated slightly earlier than the reserved time. Service staff were friendly.
5
The presentation of food is attractive and the price is reasonable.
But it's far away from the mrt, better take the taxi to there.
4
We enjoyed much from this restaurant. The different kinds of crab cooking are great taste with value for money (slightly above average price is acceptable with that quality). The staff are nice with quick services! We need to wait for taxi coming and the boss, Kelly allowed us to sit and stay for long time
3
We went to Mellben TPY last Aug 9 to celebrate my housemate's bday same time as the National holiday. It was their 1st time to dine in at Mellben. We ordered 4 different kinds of courses, including the main dish - famous chilli crab. The servings was fast, the food was tasty. The only downside was the famous chilli crab. The famous sauce that makes it tastier was just a little compared to the servings they did during their opening (rebranding to Kelly Jie). So i tried to ask the server (the lady with the boy-cut hairstyle). She told me that I should have told her that I wanted more sauce upon ordering. Oh well, i didnt bec I just thought with this kind of restaurant, they should have a good standards and protocols when it comes to their servings. But anyhow, she sais that, if someone ordered chilli crab she will add up the sauce and give us. To cut the long story short, someone ordered and she gave us additional chilli crab sauce. But of course, we have waited for quite awhile. Cravings satisfied, my friends and hubby were happy. We will still come back and recommend the place to other friends. However, servings standards should be observed. Also, the main staff who takes care of ordering must increase their friendliness approach to guests . Good customer service makes a lot of difference!
4
Formally Mellben now Kelly Jie Seafood , I assumed someone bought over this place . Their food quality has dropped a lot compare to the past . No doubt their crab vermicelli soup is a must try . Other dishes were average .
4
Butter Crab is very delicious!!! chilli crab is also Good!!
We have a good time for dining...
Good Good Good
2
Only manager could speak English and service was poor and unkind.
We tried to return remaining bottles of water and manager rejected even staff agreed.
5
Asked for recommendation and it was really good! Service is fast and efficient. Will come back again! :)
4
Service is good, food is very fresh, specially like the chili crabs taste like old times favourites.. Chops is a good amps which help us save time of waiting and save money which they give discounts
1
Standard of the food has fallen and the crabs were not fresh. Not worth the amount of money spent at all. Also, the waiter who did the ordering for us does not seem to know the food and menu well. Disappointed.
4
We reserved a place but still end up waiting for more than 30mins. Order was slow to serve as well but overall food quality is good and satisfying to the stomach.
2
This place is definitely not for pepper crabs ! Watery version while the proper one is drier and the black pepper clinging to the crabs. The fried buns was so much tinier that makes you think the owner trying cut corners. The irony is they are Charging the same $80/kg as Jumbo@clark quay and the other nicer restaurants. Service was certainly not matching with the high price tag. Not even any paper napkins or bowl of water for you to wash your hands. Jumbo even provides big napkins to cover your shirt. Oh and this is located in the neighbourhood, not even in the city. Feedback to the manageress who just brush it off with nonsensical reasons. This will be my last time and I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here for crabs. There are much better places with the same price and better service and ambience
3
Had two salted egg crabs and salted egg prawns (you are able to request for the prawns to be un-shelled at time of ordering but not after the prawns arrive) to continue our salted egg addiction, the iced pork was interesting - all were good, though the tofu was average. Remains slightly costly however
5
We have a big group of 16 pax (9 adults 7 kids). Initially booked a big table. The Chinese auntie at 1/F is very kind. She's concerned a table is too tight for us. Immediately arranged 2 tables side to side for us. Food quality is excellent. Crab bee hoon, black pepper crab, cereal prawn, salted egg prawn, fried fish bee hoon, sweet and sour pork on ice, all top notch. The bill is also very reasonable.
4
Great place if you want great food but are not too fussed about ambience and the service. The crab bee hoon, Guinness stout pork ribs, wasabi prawns and homemade tofu with cream sauce were very good.
5
We ordered a pot of crab with rice noodles and a spicy crab with some buns, the soup is excellent, and of course the spicy crab and its sauce is so prefect match with the buns.
3
Food was delicious but service was not attentive. We were left with many dirty plates on our table despite asking the staff politely to clear them for us during our meal.
5
Tried 4 dishes on a busy Friday evening and the food was tasty! Value for money crab dishes. Recommended to try out that salty egg ribs, crab beehoon and chilli crab!
4
Mellben chilli crab is really good, must get the fried mantou to dip in the yummy sauce. But my favourite is still the claypot beehoon (thin one) crab!!! The broth is simply delicious.
4
The concept is pretty similar to Jumbo just that they are located in the neighbourhood. Their dishes were innovative, their crabs are fresh but some dishes are hit and misses. Still worth to try!
3
What's the point of reserving if they still make you queue until you placed your order? Please note melben will only seat you 10-15mins AFTER you placed all orders, and they warn you subsequent orders will take 45min to an hour to fulfill.
3
To be fair, a few of their dishes (creamy butter crab, crab bee hoon soup) stood out (both of which were very pricey). But the rest of the dishes were so-so. My main beef with the establishment is in the way you're rushed to order your dishes because the restaurant is in demand and fills up quickly. *There's even a separate line for people who made reservations ahead of time to queue in when you arrive. If you're looking to try their signature dishes, by all means, get it out of your system but for the price and service, it's unlikely I'd make a repeat visit.
4
8 of us. you have to order main crab meals at the counter outside, then drinks, then they give you the table number you can walk in. there is upstairs with aircon which was good with kids. Soup with noodle was creamy crab taste, then butter crab was creamy yummy with some fried buns but very similar taste so probably better with something like chill crab in stead. The menu was little bit different from Tanjong Pager brunch, pork chops were cooked with guinness here and prawn with mango was with wasabi-mayo, actually TP ones were better for the kids, simple taste
2
Went for Father's Day celebration, it was very crowded and we had to queue to order our food and drinks before we are seated. They served quickly once all guests seated, as some of us arrived around 30 mins late, seems like rushing for 2nd seating. The pace is too rush, and they even misses one of our crab dish and fried mantou. It was all good since we ordered 2 dishes extra when they told us our order wasn't enough! Services is below average probably due to high traffic of patrons due to festive. Food standard seems to drop as well and food serves wasn't very warm
5
Mellben Seafood is one of the best crab joint in Singapore. Loved by local's and travellers alike. Forget about Jumbo and No Sign Board, this is the palce to go.
4
The Chilli crab is pretty normal, taste just like any other Zi char store. Was hosting a foreign Friend, and 1 of the staff was friendly enough to explain the dishes.
4
The butter and bee Hoon crabs and the Italian prawn were good . Isn't that cheap for a Coffeeshop ambience
5
Have been to this restaurant many times in the past. Decided to visit to celebrate my dad's birthday. Food is still great ... the chili crab, claypot crab with beehoon, ice sweet & sour pork are the perennial favourites. Price is getting expensive though
4
We had great crab noodle soup plus salted egg crab (dry).
Still their signature crab noodle soup is a stand out.
4
The crab bee hoon was nice, but the soup was slightly too salty for me. If you have friends from overseas who are looking for some local flavour, the crab bee hoon definitely worth a try.
3
Food is slightly above average. With neighbour restaurant, should charge neighbourhood price.
Now they are charging East Coast Seafood Restaurant costing.
5
Food is good and restaurants is very cleanly. The service is very fast and really executed .we feel good
3
Orders are taken at the queue before seated even if you have a reservation. Order taking lady was totally distracted and kept running all over whilst taking my order. She kept insisting the food I ordered was insufficient even if I felt it was more than enough. Drinks can be ordered while seated but didn't show up till half hour later after 2 dishes have arrived and server needed to be reminded about missing drinks. Food tasted as before but prices are high. Restaurant is obviously short of service staff .
4
The restaurant was next to Toa Payoh hawker centre. I was there on a rainy Sunday night so didn't have to wait for a table. Many local people were there for its crab and other Chinese dishes. Waiters were friendly and welcoming. Tried its famous claypot crab vermicelli soup. The soup was so delicious, the crab meat was very fresh and the vermicelli was tasty. Highly recommended for crab lovers!
2
Service was poor. Staff did not get our orders right and had to ask us repeatedly. They were not polite when taking orders.
5
Service was great. Food was delicious. The restaurant was kind to absorb the rice, peanut n wet tissue. Overall love it. We enjoy all. Will come again.
2
The worst black pepper crab I have ever had in Singapore over the past 20 years! And it was expensive! The store was actually located next to the hawker stores. Definitely not recommended.
1
The waiter at the reservation was so rude, He left me standing there for 10 mins without uttering a word.
4
Food was great unfortunately While there was fan, the humid weather made us feel less comfortable during lunch.
3
Ordered chilli crab, cray pot Bee Hoon crab, sambal kang kong, prosperity chicken. 1 star is deducted as the kang kong dish was not fresh, and overall did not have any taste. Cray pot crab was yummy but they can try to stir fry the crab before adding into the soup. Propersity chicken is really good, but abit pricy. Service is good even though it was very crowded
3
Bringing two foreigners to have dinner there and purposely order Chilie Crab. 4 of us order a 800g crab, very fleshy, they cut the crab to 8 pieces. It is worth the price!However, we can't sit there long enough to talk. We finished our meal in about 45 minutes, and they quickly clean the table... don't really have time to chit chat with friends.
1
For the price I've paid, it was indeed a let-down. I've read the reviews about waiting in line even after reservation but I didn't expect it to be so long. The staff were not very nice and it's mostly due to short of staff. We had to order before sitting.After 20 mins, from my reservation timing (I even went earlier to order, so I submitted my meal order at the time of my reservation), my family waited close to 30 minutes for the first dish. What was puzzling was the fact that the crabs were served before the appetizers and others. The crabs given were very small and it turned cold very fast. The ambience was rather sad because everyone was just upset, waiting so long for their food. At the end of the whole meal, when we made payment, it's almost the same price as other seafood places in town area with possibly a better view. Would not recommend to any of my friends
3
My first time here, and was satisfied but not awed by the food. Crabs are not cheap at $80/kg but the Crab Bee Hoon soup waa very rich in flavour. Guiness Pork Ribs were well done as well. Venison with Bittergourd was good too.Their Bean Curd was so-so and signature Bee Tai Mak was average
1
Went for early Mother's Day celebration, which turns to a horrible experience.1. Booked a table with a remark to have an aircon surrounding - nobody called to inform that the level 2 tables with the aircon is closed, only informed AFTER we reached the place and asked if need to wait long for the level 2 table! *WHY EVEN BOTHER HAVING A REMARKS COLUMN IN CHOPE SECTION, WHEN THE RESTAURANT DON'T BOTHER TO READ?*2. To save on cost, we requested the waiter to keep the 1 plate of peanuts and 2 plates of sliced young papaya which they served as appetisers - when informed the waiter to do so, the waiter told me that 1 peanut + 1 sliced papaya comes AS A SET, and since it's a set, we told the waiter to just keep 1 set, since we had 1 plate of the peanuts already.. *AT THE END OF THE BILL, THE 2 ITEMS WERE CHARGED SEPARATELY! WHEN I ASKED MY HUSBAND TO ASK THE CASHIER, THEY MERELY CAME WITH THE EXCUSE THAT THE WAITER IS NEW AND DIDN'T KNOW* - what kind of excuse is that? if the waiter is new, how can in the first place he said that the appetizers come AS A SET?! 3. All items served were COLD! The 2 crabs that we ordered on 2 different sauces, 2 plates of vegetables, a seafood pot (which supposedly known to be HOT) and a plate of hor fun.. ALL WERE COLD.. *WE DID NOT EVEN RUSH THEM.. WE CAN WAIT.. BUT APPARENTLY THE CHEFS INSIDE CAN'T?!*4. Called 7 drinks (4 soft drinks, 2 coconuts, 1 hot milo kosong) - served all 6 correct except the hot milo, which the server served as cold milo. Informed the server that I requested for hot milo kosong and not cold (since i can't take cold due to my pregnancy), the server very rudely say "oh! then the waiter just have to pay for this!" and went on to confront the waiter that took our drinks order - NOT TOO SURE IF HE IS TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD FOR NOT TAKING THE WRONG DRINK THAT HE SERVED ME OR THAT IS JUST HOW THEY BEHAVE TOWARDS CUSTOMER?!5. OVERCHARGED US FOR DRINKS - 7 drinks amounting to $28, with just merely $2 for a cup of soft drink and $1.50 for a cup of hot milo, does that mean the 2 coconuts worth $9.25 each??? - WE WERE NOT EVEN RUSHING THEM TO GIVE US THE BILL! I don't see how they can define this overcharging as a plain "oversight"! It might seems to be their "specialty" on overcharging customers.. After my husband asked them how they calculate the drinks, then they supposedly "realised" they overcharged us! WOW what a story..!Never returning to this restaurant.
4
Always my favorite place for crab beehoon to bring all my friends and family from overseas to! Rest of the dishes are always good too!
4
food was good and service was good! we booked the table and it was on time to reserved the table for us
2
Paying restaurant pricing for non restaurant experience.
Small portion when ordered large.
Had reservation but waited 30mins past reservation time.
5
Butter Crab taste is best in the world...
I most like here
Easy to Reservation...but I think AMK Mellben Seafood is better....
2
Service provider considered rude
Work according to their mood
Basically it's self service restaurant
5
I really enjoyed the clay pot crab vermicelli. That is the best thing of this restaurant. Also they have salted egg fried chicken. That is also a must try meal.
3
I had made reservations on Saturday 7pm, arrived on time but the staff told me frankly they had given my table to someone else. We have to wait half hour for another table. This was rather upsetting as I had my elderly father and young son who were hungry. Also, the Mellben reservations system automatically calls you several hours before to confirm. I had enjoyed past visits but this time the night did not start out well, the food also seems not as good. May not be coming again foreseeable future
5
Arrived at 630pm and we thought we were early. The restaurant was full. Fortunately they take walk ins and we only had to waiy 15 mins for a table.Food arrived very promptly. We ordered the pork ribs, chicken ' lollipops', broccoli with bean curd and mushroom, and the infamous delicious crab with thick rice noodles and the chilli crab with buns.All the dishes were very flavourful especially the succulent crab dishes. Very satisfying meal. Cost off the meal was not cheap but it was worth it!Do make a reservation to avoid waiting.
4
I find the food item on the menu very interesting and if you are a fan of salted egg yolk, you are in for a treat. We had salted egg yolk Pork ribs (surprisely very tender), salted egg yolk long bean ( cannot stop eating), crab bee hoon, creamy crab plus many other dishes. I would go back again and bring other groups of friends to eat here again.
5
My Singaporean friends recommended this place for me and made reservation ahead for us. I'm actually not a big fan of crab, but ordered both butter & chilli crab based on her advice. We loved the butter crab! It is creamy and blends perfectly with the crab meat! Ate the crab with fried mantau of course. We also ordered some vegies and everything tasted so fresh. Will definitely come back again, but reservation is a must
3
Food standard has dropped though prices have increased. Still okay with curry crab. Other dishes same as any other zhi char places, nothing special.
4
The food was good. We didn't have to wait long for it. The staff were friendly. We enjoyed our dinner very much.
4
Food was great, especially liked the crab bee hoon soup. Went there just to have this for my birthday. just that alittle on the pricey side
4
Food's still as yummy as before. especially the crab beehoon.
Only grouse is, despite making a reservation at 730pm, we only had a table at around 8pm.
3
was not recommended any dishes to try so went ahead with ordering on my own. staff were new and didnt know the menu well. the playboy chicken was not as good as amk one.my 2 crabs cost $150. and very wierdly there is one big and one small claw in each of the 2 styles i asked for. i suspect its one big one small but they mix the claw making me believe its both big crabs
4
We made a reservation but found to our chagrin we still had to queue up to be seated.That disappointment aside, the staff was friendly and helpful and the food delightful. Found new items on the menu since my last visit some time ago, and the new addition was pretty good too. Apart from the crab Beehoon which was the reason we were there,the long beans in salted egg was crunchy and flavoursome. So my piece of advice.... go early.
4
We made a reservation at 6pm on a Sunday . We were there before the crowd came . It was my second time at Melben . I went to their Tai Seng branch a few years ago , and I did not remember that it was good . However , I enjoyed all the dishes which my Aunty ordered at the Toa Payoh branch . My favourite dish is the Crab Bee Hoon Soup. The soup was totally umami and delish . They allowed us to top up the broth along , an aspect which I like . My second favourite dish is the Pork Rib with the Butter Curry Leaf Source . I do not eat pork but I find the the Butter Curry Leaf Soup tasty . My favourite dish is the good old Kang Kong Sambal Blachan. It was very well fried with the wok taste . The vegetables remained green and crunchy . I also enjoyed the Herbal Chicken. The chicken was tender . The Broccoli Mushroom was also yummy . To my surprise , I like the Black Pepper Crab with Bee Hoon in Claypot . The level of spiciness was just right . Our group of 15 people ordered 7 dishes with rice and drinks . The bill came up to be about $300 plus which I find it reasonable . The service was attentive and polite . I will go back again ! Food Quality : *****Service : ****Ambience : ****Price Range : $$

Food was delicious 7/10.Ambiance-7/10Service-8/10Price-Some of the dishes are reasonable. Crabs is slightly on the high side. Chili crab taste -8/10. Custard cream crab- 6.5/10. guiness pork rib-8/10. Small Buns was expensive.The peanuts & appetizer was a waste & not neccessary @$8. Packet towel per table of 10 cost $8.
3
Order a chili crab. Taste is not bad and it didn't take long for the dish to come.However, they had a limit of 1 crab per table. It would have been better if this was made known when i made the reservation. If I had known, we would have considered another place
3
Food is nice especially the chili crab but the portion is pretty small. There are still room for improvement in term of service. We need to order before we are seated, there is not enough time to think through what to order and the food didn't come all together. We already finished all the other dishes before our crab dishes arrived. I hope that next time they can arrange in a way that all dishes are able to arrived at the same time
4
Food was great and the variety is good as well. Priced reasonably for the quality of food. Recommended for families:)
1
Terrible service attitude from the PRC waiter and waitress! Food is only so-so, nothing fantastic! A restaurant to forget! Will never patronise again.
4
Tried the steam crab and black pepper crab w rice vermicelli. Both dishes are fresh and flavourful..
3
The crab bee hoon soup was good but ironically we actually preferred the meat to the seafood.prices were a bit steep as well and waiters seemed confused as to what desserts were available and what was sold out.
3
This place came highly recommended. But I was somehow disappointed with the quality of food tonight. Maybe the main chef was on leave? The crab bee hoon was mediocre at best and the service was horrible.
1
I requested fr aircon place in my reservation however upon arrival they told me that aircon is only available between 5.30 to 6pm n UNCOMMITABLE (cos They need time to start the aircon but in truth they r UNWILLINGLY to just 'On' the aircon on the upper floor if the non aircon area r not fully filled in). IF such is their practice they shud be upfront about it rather than giving creapy lies. This also reflect dishonesty n apathetic attitude in the service. It abt their own benefit but disregards customer needs. Food was below average as I cud get the similar quality in the nearby food centre fr a fraction of their cost. This is my first n well be last visit n certainly wud not recommend anyone to them

It isn't easy to find large meaty crabs (and at a reasonable price) in Singapore and we're so happy we found this place. It has inevitably become our go-to restaurant when we're craving for huge crabs with roe that make your cholesterol level shoot up. The signature claypot bee hoon is certainly a must-try, the soup is to-die-for because it tastes as if it had been cooked with the crab roe for the longest time. Come here with more people so you can order more and try other dishes. We can't wait to be back
5
This is my favourite place for seafood in Singapore! You must order the clay pot crab beehoon and butter crab. Best dishes! The only bad thing about this place is that even with reservations you have to wait. Well, I guess good things are the worth the wait right
3
We have been trying out zi char (casual local chinese wok fry dishes) in Singapore and have been to Two Chefs (C), New Ubin Seafood (B-) and Sek Tong Gai (see my review, A-). On their website Melben has 8 branches but we did the Tao payoh branch in Lorong 8. The 7 of us ordered a bunch of the 'famous' dishes and they were okay not 'must try' except for the Bee tai Bak essentially spicy rice noodles (Lo xu fun) which has great wok hei just enough chili to make it finger licking good (A). Crab Bee Hoon (B), Fried tofu with Spinach (B+), Salted egg string beans (B+, too much salted egg, would have been an A with less salted egg), salted egg prawns (B-, forgettable). Upstairs is airconditioned. All in a party must be present to be seated
4
Place: located in heart land of Singapore, where many communities. Design like HDB town centerFood: Crab Mee Hun soup - something different from Chili crab, milky soup is quite tastyBBQ pork rib - sweet and tenderBamboo crab - tasty garlicOverall: Good local experience, recommend to come early otherwise long waiting line
2
Used to enjoy e signatures dish. Last visit proved otherwise. Beehoon crab is so so, nothing to remember for, service is worse than that. U cannot even place a bottle of oolong tea about to finish on the dining table.
4
Good quality food, but long waiting time. The staff are polite and will usher you to your seats, the 2nd level dining area is air-conditioned and spacious.
5
Ordered their golden sand crabs, wasabi prawns, signature fried rice and 3 type pork ribs. All dishes met expectations! Was a wonderful birthday meal indeed.
4
The moment we arrived to informing the reception my name for the reservation, perfectly smooth and seamless.
4
Extremely fresh and tasty food served. Although very packed, they served the food promptly. They should change the diners' plate after 4 or 5 dishes have been served though.

My friends and i came here on a Saturday night for dinner. We got there around 8pm and there was a bit of a queue and wait. There's a machine that you input the number of people in your party and contact number. It shows you what number you are in the queue and they'll call you when your table is ready. After you get your number you proceed to the right where there are menus and they will take your order straight away.We were told the wait for the table would be about 30 minutes but it ended up being only abt 15-20min wait. There's a hawker centre right next to the restaurant so we just walked around for a bit. After we were seated the food came out pretty quickly since they already had our order. We ordered chilli crab, crab bee hoon and a plate of greens with sambal sauce. The chilli crab was delicious and had a nice kick of chilli compared to other places I've eaten at in the past. They were also really generous with the amount of sauce. I was really tempted to get them to pack the left over sauce up for me to take home with me haha It was really nice. My friend told us that mellben is known for their crab bee hoon and it definitely didn't disappoint! The crab soup was amazing and you could really taste the sweetness of the crab in it. The bee hoon noodles (round chubby rice noodles) were chewy with great texture. The crab dishes were $60 sgd each which is pretty good deal compared the quality and price you'd pay in Australia. I was really satisfied with my meal !! Will definitely visit again when I'm in town next time
4
What I ordered: Butter Crab - must try. Sambal Fried Rice - very good. Crab Bee Hoon - soup too fishy and salty for my taste, but the crab was tasty Suggestion:(1) Mix the butter crab gravy to your portion of the sambal fried rice and have it together -> New level of yumminess! (2) Use your Hands - to have the full flavour of eating crab, you have to use your hands. There's a household wares shop just across, get your extra wet wipes there (3) Avoid queing - I secured a table just a couple of hours before dinner by using the Chope app.May-the-Crab-Be-With-You
2
Quite over priced, the crab meat wasn't as firm, plump and didn't fill up the shell as I had expected and tasted a bit "freshwater / muddy"Surprised the black pepper crab had onions, not usual. I prefer the standard way of black pepper crab recipe without onions The soup from crab bee hoon was not flavorful enough What was nice is the salted egg long beans, crunchy and well coated with salted egg batter$256 for 2 crabs + 排骨王 + salted egg long beans + cereal prawns + 2 beer and one oolong tea + yusheng (doesn't taste nice :(

The first time we went to Mellben Seafood was around 7 years ago when it was not a Michelin recommended restaurant by that time. We have been the AMK Mellben Seafood for few times and it's a MUST visit restaurant each time when we visited Singapore. This is our first time to the TPY Mellben Seafood. We went to TPY this time because only TPY allows for online reservation. The online reservation is very convenient for visitors located outside Singapore. We do not need to wait for the long queue if we have made an online reservation in advance and this is very good for families bringing with a baby. The seafood was very good and value for money (We have only spent SGD 300 for 6 people dinner) especially their Claypot Crab Vermicelli Soup, this is a MUST try food if you are a first time visitor! Black Pepper Crab and Crispy Nestum Shrimp are very good too! P.S. if you order Crab Vermicelli Soup for family, you might need to order extra Vermicelli and Crab Soup in advance. We have already done that and we still found the Vermicelli are not enough. When we want to order one more Crab Vermicelli after we finished and the waiter told us that we need to wait for an hour because it's the restaurant's peak hour
4
We made a reservation on Chope for 7.15pm but were told that we could only get a table at 8pm (they took our orders first though). Although we managed to sit by about 7.45pm, the food arrived at about 8.15pm or so. But other than that, the food was really good! Crab was really fresh and yummy, and dishes like the salted egg french bean, nai bai with cordeceps and tofu with mushrooms were great too
5
- Fast services
- Reasonable pricing
- Nice food
- Option to choose dining area with a/c
- Definitely will be back for more
4
The place was not airconditioned and the price paid for doesn't match with the ambience.
Not worth the price paid for.
2
prices of crabs is far too pricey, taste like normal zichar nothing fancy and expensive. will not go back again
4
The crab was excellent! Loved the pork ribs as well. Reasonable prices for the food and staff were friendly.
4
Overall the atmosphere is good.Staff is very helpful and efficient though the restaurant is packed with customers.Food is nice as well especially the salted egg drumstick. Thank you.
4
Food was served very shortly after we ordered. Delicious crabs with lots of crab roe but service could have been a bit more attentive.
4
Had the signature clay pot crab been hoon soup and it was very tasty. Crab was sweet with a lot of roe too. The chilled sweet and sour pork was quite interesting and pretty good too.
4
Went with family for lunch. Other than the signature crab bee hoon, we also ordered chilli crab and some other local dishes. Crabs were big, but I would have preferred the chilli crab to be more spicy though. The staff strength on a lazy Sunday was adequate though there were a few times when we had difficulties catching their attention. Service was acceptable, to be fair. Better if the place was air conditioned
1
I usually give reviews unless the place is very good or in this case very bad.It was a very bad experience. We were seated on the 2nd level and there were only 3 waiters serving the area. They were obviously short -handed. The waiters completely ignore me when i raised my hand to ask for their service. I had to walk up to them every time i needed their service. And throughout the whole dinner, i had to keep walking to them for their service because they kept forgetting to our request or provide us the necessary utensils.. For eg, they served us soup without providing us spoons, i have to go up to them to get the spoons myself. The meal was not cheap and the food was so-so. The standard of the crabs were not as good as the ones i had at Ang Mo Kio. The food is really overrated and the restaurant is in a coffeeshop. For the similar price, i can get better service and standard at a decent seafood restaurant
4
Expectations were met as usual, with the delicious food and great service! A party of 5, and our total bill including drinks came up to $270. Which was totally worth it for the amount of food we ordered! We had crab beehoon soup, chili crab, signature chicken, 2 vegetable dishes and the fried buns. All of which we gobbled them up. Definitely coming back again!
2
Would be better if the food is hot instead of lukewarm and this is the second time I visited. Same experience as previous
3
Creamy butter crab was nice, however the gravy is not as thick as other restaurant in AMK.
Salted Egg crab was too floury, this is below average.
Fried mantou served cold, not crispy.
4
Love dining there with family for crabs. Love butter crab the most! Also the meat on ice. Will prefer 2nd floor for more cooking environment
4
Went with overseas visitors, need to book in advance bit recommend to start early. A nice alternative to other popular similar restaurant s especially if staying near city area. Foods is generally good and after dinner can bring visitors go see local living nearby.
4
Made a reservation on Chope for 4 pax and was ushered to our seats almost immediately. The food was exceptional; as always. We had the Signature Crab Bee Hoon soup, garlic bamboo clams, salted egg yolk prawns and a plate of vegetables.
3
The food we had was ok (we tried only 2 crabs menu) but for the price, I would expect better service. For 150sgd, at least they could switch on the aircon!
4
I've heard much about the restaurant so was excited to recommend to visiting friends to try out. it's really hard to find the place but more importantly we were surprised there is no air con. thankfully food was good but i certainly won't return for lunch
2
Got recommended to try out "Mellben seafood" by quite a few friends and relatives for their chilli crabs! Upon arrival, we found the staff are very cold towards patrons and don't really care about who comes in or goes out. The restaurant is very understaffed which slows the process of everything down and you end up waiting about an hour for your food. Whatever staff are there just sit around looking at each other and not acknowledging anybody trying to call them over. As for the food.. The chilli crab was quite delicious however everything else on the menu is dramatically over priced and is of poor standard. They charge you for EVERYTHING, the "complimentary" peanuts when you arrive to the refresher towel after you make a $150 purchase. Overall, would not come again however the chilli crab was very tasty! (Only reason it gets a 2
4
Have heard many raving about Mellben so made a reservation on a random Wednesday night and wasn't disappointed. Suitable place for dining in a big group. Staff were nice and they kept bringing us food we didn't order (too nice? I'm not complaining) so pots of food kept travelling around the restaurant - probably some mix-ups in the kitchen. So much love for the crab bee hoon. Broth was delightful and crab was good. Also had the chive leaves with garlic (love), ribs, fried yam, prawns - they were all made quite creatively, not your usual chinese restaurant dishes for sure. No complaints :
4
Great place to dine if you are willing to spend a little more.. can take a bus "238" from Toa Payoh Interchange. The crab gravy are quite creamy and rich.Tips: have to made reservation earlier for table as it is always pack with people you cant just walk in and expected to get a table immediately
4
Food: Chili & salted egg Crab are yummy. Mantou is great too. Mixed vegetables is great too.
Service: great.
Ambience: good and clean.
4
As per above.
Food served is fast
Atmosphere is avg
Birthday treat awesome celebration
The taste of crab bee hoon is different from amk branch. Still prefer amk version
2
Food is ok, but the service was terrible. We went in at 5om, but they said they didn't open the 2nd floor air-conditioned room until 6-7pm.
4
Good food, good service, good ambience. Value of food could be better in terms of portion. Chope coupon helps save some money though! :p
4
Always love the crab bee hoon there. Without fail always meet my expectation. The other dishes may not be so fantastic.. Service was ok
4
Was looking for a Crab Beehoon, and the Uber driver told me about this place, so i went by curiosity. And i ordered the signature Crab Beehoon (they have different name on the menu). To be honest, i've tasted a better soup and beehoon, but the Crab??? One of The Best!!!! I traveled quite far to this place, but i didn't regret it. Would love to come back to try another Crab menu. Maybe Crab braised beehoon...
3
Not enjoying seafood, this was always going to be a challenge for me. However I appreciated the local setting, the atmosphere, the vast array of fish dishes, which everyone else enjoyed! Prices were a little more expensive than I expected but it was not an issue considering the quality and quantity of food.I would recommend the crispy chilled sweet and sour pork a delicious and unusual dish 
4
When last visiting Singapore I came with a colleague who knew I was a big fan of chilli crab. It was great to see where locals eat and to be in a more residential local area. Our meal was all about the crab. We tried one cooked in a noodle broth which was my preference, followed by chilli crab. The crabs were a great size and full of flavour. Service was good and in true local style, they told us if we were planning to eat too much and wouldn't let us order! I'd perhaps been a little spoiled by crab I'd had earlier in the week but nonetheless it was still a great meal. Definitely worth the drive
4
The Crab beehoon soup alone is worth going back for. Sweat, meaty crabs in full-flavoured soup. Some other dishes we tried were the boiled prawns, prawn paste chicken, venison with spring onions and ginger,. All good.Service was fine for us. Prompt, efficient, courteous. Nothing like what we've read about
5
Great customer service, better than many restaurants in the mall. Good variety of crab and tze char dishes prepared and served to the best! A great place to host guests who love crabs My absolute favourites are the salted egg beans, salted egg crabs, ice sweet sour pork, claypot crab bee hoon soup, sesame sauce prawns, assorted vegetables with nuts...and their sour plum juice rock
4
Seafood was super fresh and treated with respect! Crab dishes were fantastic. Service was fast! Food was served very fast too!
3
Food taste is average, food portion is small, price is expensive, Long waiting time, service is slow and tend to forget request.
4
Having a small gathering with friend to try their food. The crab never fail to surprise the guest that never try before, the Mongolia style deer meat is one of the nice choice as well.. Tofu, pork rib and prawns.. Food tasting with friend..
4
Nice food. Good service. Lucky we went early and we escaped the queue. Price wise reasonable and not overcharging
1
I made reservation at 730. And i have to wait for half an hour before i get my table. Table was arranged at on last corner with terrible dim light (no restaurant light). Food was not up to standrd.
4
Must try:
Crab Beehoon
Guiness Pork
Fry tofu with green sauce
Plum / Lime Juice
Vega abit oily, pricing slight expensive
3
service is unfriendly, and can't use voucher purchased via chope (will never buy voucher from Chope again)
5
would come back for more. The food is really good and special. I guess their busy for a really good reason.
2
The waitress from China shows very very bad attitude. When I pay for bill, she is slow and don't know what to calculate. I wait almost 5-10 minutes. I asked her whether can be faster and she replied me "sorry, I just learned and you have to bear with it.
3
We came here on recommendations from family & friends & the food was quite delicious. Easy enough to get to via Taxi, service was ok, place looks clean. It's located near the food court so wasn't expecting anything too expensive but we ordered 6 dishes and it came to just over $300! Highly recommend the Crab Bee Hoon Soup
3
Ordered seafood dishes to celebrate mum's birthday. Bill came up to $400+ for 10 pax which is a bit pricey for the quality and location.
2
Was disappointed with the crab dishes. Size was really small. Was told have to order in advance if want bigger crabs.🙁Standard have dropped.
4
This time we tried the black pepper crab and ordered the crab bee hoon again.
As always the crab bee hoon never disappoints. Delightful!
5
We went to Mellben with family and friends. We ordered Crab Noodle Soup, iced sweet sour pork, Toufu, Shrimp Paste Chicken Wings. Food was very delicious and service is good as well. We want to visit again.
3
May be overprice for some dishes Coconut ran out quite early in the night, make reservation to avoid disappointment
3
We enter the restaurant after rush hour. The waiting time for the food to arrive is extremely slow. Its a bit over-rated i feel.
4
i thought this is same with the one in AMK, however the fact is that, the crabs here are clearly more expensive, since they are in a small portion with a uni charging of 60 dollar each.the rib and stir fried vegi is very nice, while the shrimp is a hel
4
Heard many negative reviews about the service staffs but food no doubt is good. We manage to get seated at 2nd floor (air-conditioned). Tried their signatures dishes the 3 sauces for sour pork, crab bee hoon, chilli crab etc...food presentation is good but potion slightly smaller. Do get seated early to avoid long wait...
2
Quite disappointed. The place was hot and noisy. Request to sit outdoor was turned down. Ordered Chilly crab, Wasabi prawn, salted egg Long beans, fried mee tai MAK and or nee dessert. The food wasn't great, the mee tai MAK quantity was small and most of the desserts were not available. They don't serve plain water, had to buy bottled mineral water, that's a big minus point for me. Don't think I'll visit again
3
The quality of the food was inconsistent. The first time I went there I was quite impressed with the food so I brought my family there. The second time the beehoon crab soup was too salty and the crispy fried rice was just average. I hope that they can be more consistent in future
5
Be sure to order extra soup and noodle while placing your orders otherwise waiting time will be long for that if added later.
1
rude waiter, food was ok, but definitely not worth the price. would go elsewhere for crabs! didnt have a good experience at the amk outlet previously either.
4
Brought my parents, parent-in-law and grandparents in-law for dinner. Food was nice especially my favourite crab bee hoon with soup. However waiting time for the first dish a bit long. After that the food was served promptly.
4
The food was nice except the home made beancurd with creamy butter sauce at the side. The creamy butter sauce was very watery. Not up to the usual standard when i visit during other occasions
5
The food so nice and fast,i came ard 9pm so no need to queue,we tried butter cream crab,crispy fried rice,vege,all is delicious
4
Good serving of crabs. Service was efficient, with ordering placed before the group is seated. Pricing was reasonable and well worth the money. Would definitely visit Mellben for crabs again.
4
My family enjoyed the beehoon crab and chilli crab and the salted egg prawn but the black pepper was not up to expectation.
2
Appetiser was set on the table as default and although we didn't touch it, they charged for it just because we didn't specifically mention to return... So we were forced to pay for something we didn't even touch.
5
We ordered crab bee hoon, sambal kang kong, guiness stout pork ribs, and tofu seaweed. All the dishes were delicious.
3
We arrived earlier than our table booking time. However, we were told to stand at the counter to place food order first then can go in (though the restaurant was only 30% full at that time). We were shouted to make order by an annoying face. Really not a nice experience to pay $68 for an 700g-800g with such type of customer service. Some other staff were polite and helpful though
4
Friendly waitress makes good recommendation & ideal portion. Fresh & delicious crabs that must be in your A list to be ordered.
3
There were many flies as we were given an outdoor seat even when we requested for an indoor seat. Service was poor, under staff/difficult to get staff attention when we need help, no tools were given to help crack the crabs.
5
Mellben doesn't disappoint. The crab bee Hoon soup is as good as I first had it at the original branch at Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 a decade ago.
This dish is a must try
4
We tried the Crab Beehoon Soup (SGD60), the soup tasted rich and fresh. Crab meat was succulent and the beehoon went well with everything. We had Creamy Butter Prawn and it cost SGD32 for 10 prawns, which is quite expensive in my opinion. The sauce was greate though. Another dish was Garlic Kangkong which was not bad as well. Overall, quite a satisfying meal even though the prices are a little high. They charged SGD2 each for peanuts and another side as well, so do take note if you do not eat it
4
We ordered their famous crab meehoon, its very nice. The sweetness of the crab are soaked in the meehoon. Another dish we had is the Stout Pork Rib, the meat is tender and soft. Overall the food are good, just that even we had reserved seats. We still have to wait a short while (approx. 10-15mins)
5
I went to Mellben Seafood with my fiance and one other couple, and we enjoyed the experience very much! The service was good, food portions were huge (we ordered all the dishes in small size, and when the dishes came, we thought the waiter had gotten our portion wrong!) and most importantly, it's not as crowded as the one at Ang Mo Kio. Great
5
A cab driver referred us to this place saying it's not yet well known among tourists. I am surprised this place is not rated higher on Trip Advisor but when I read some of the negative reviews they seemed to lack anything of substance. We ordered the crab noodle soup and we practically licked the bowl. We also noticed not one person in the fully packed restaurant left any food behind. It's a fair price for the value and quality of food. We are die hard foodies. Would highly recommend!
4
I love this restaurant.Their chilli crab is beyond perfection!My gf and I had 2 types of crab, and chilli crab was definitely our favourite.The staff complimented us for finishing both of the dishes.I definitely recommend this place for crab and seafood enthusiasts
3
Waiting time is faster with reservation than to walked in. Food served quite fast after we sat down, staffs are friendly too. Except it is a little noisy as we were on the second floor, as every table in each table talks at the same time. This is what Singapore has to improve, in order for others and themselves to enjoy their meals. Overall the restaurant is GOOD
3
service level is poor to average. have to place order prior to seated. Even with reservation still have to wait. food is average considering the same prices you would pay in restaurants like Jumbo and No signboard. Even indoor seating with aircon was not cool and even sweating.
1
Went there after researching online. At the end, total disappointment. May be not before, it is now a complete tourist trap. No service and food is worse than average.
3
Good quality of food, fair quality of service. Have to order before be seated. and they made the wrong order of the crab and convicted you to accept the wrong one.
3
In comparison, I still prefer the crab from the Ang MoKio branch. From some of my colleagues who tried for the first time said the taste is good.
5
We went there to celebrate my Mother in law's birthday. The crab beehoon soup was Super! So yummy my 5 year old Cousin drank and ate 3 bowls of soup and noodles.
3
Food was good. Black pepper crab so so. Chilli crab is great. We also ordered herbal chicken which was great. Service was good.
4
Always great to eat here, a little pricey but yummy. Booking a table for 4 was easy but had to wait in line for 25mins to order before being taken to the table. By the time you get to the front of the queue your table has disappeared off the system. Make sure you tell staff you are there before you line up
4
Visited with friends who travel to Singapore.It was value for money but not easy to get there(took taxi).I booked with Chope but the reservation was not registered although I received multiple emails and text messages.The waiter was kind enough to offer us seats on 2nd floor
5
Very satisfied with the chope reservation..they reminded me a day before to confirm my reservation and even send me an email confirmation. Upon arrival at the restaurant, my family were immediately given our table no and directed upstairs where there was aircon..I even had space to put my stroller:) My family love the food and the crab Beehoon is to die for. Will definitely go back again
4
It's not my first visit to the restaurant. However, I have noticed that the amount of food presented has grown smaller (probably due to inflation). The area is still pretty nice to have a decent meal. The food arrived promptly and the service staff are polite and helpful
3
Order system is poor. Have to order before being seated. (Seems like you will be judged on what you order.) Even though reservations were made, had to queue to order even though everyone of us have reached. The few customers in front took a while to order, which is understandable due to recommendations and explaining some of the dishes. But with kids having around, they should have seated everyone first. We waited about 20 mins just to place an order before we were given seats
5
Crab Bee Hoon is always our favourite! Fresh crab, yummy soup and bee hoon. Staff is friendly and service is good. We ordered a coconut drink and the coconut was a bit too old, they replaced us a fresh one.
3
There were too many people and probably understaffed, hence there was a little inadequate attention provided. Food was decent.
2
Crab hv no standard for the price we paid. Nobody remind us that we left a cake there for bday celebration very disappointed
4
Crab mee hoon soup very tasty. Guiness stout pork rib tender n soft.My 86 year old in law eat 2pcs n really enjoy it.
4
Love the fried rice, creamy butter prawns and salted egg yolk pork ribs but find the crabs so-so only. Ordered both the chili and beehoon crab.
4
First time trying the Toa Payoh branch and was not disappointed. Well cooked crabs and it was easy to find seatsUnfortunately, they did not have crabs heavier than 1 kg that day (I never encountered this at the Ang Mo Kio branch). The mantou was also cold when served (it was always served hot at the other branch).Having said that, I would still come here just because the queue is shorter
3
We went there for the famous chile crab. Traveling w/siblings & some of them were planning on going to Mellben for the Singaporean crabs & we weren't going to join them except that we had a lot of money to use up before heading home, so we went. The crab is VERY expensive!! It was something like $60-$75 US Dollars for one depending on size. We tried 3 different sauces & none were worth the price! The chile crab was more of a tomato & egg-based sauce, not spicey. I guess, because that's a Singapore specialty, you might want to try, but really not worth it
2
I have frequented this restaurant for over 10 years. It has been almost 2 years since my last visit. Today, we had a family dinner and I was disappointed by the crab quality.My all time favourites dishes are butter crab, Guinness stout pork ribs, crab bee hoon and salted yolk prawns. We ordered all that tonight. Pork ribs and prawns remained the same to my relief.The disappointment came from the crab dishes. The crabs were hardly juicy and sizeable. We were told each crab weighed about 800 grams but they looked small when served. Butter crab and crab bee hoon were priced at $60 each. Hardly value for money.There are other restaurants that offer better quality crabs at $60 a piece. I hope the restaurant seriously improves its crab dishes which used to be its signature food.

I have been visiting this restaurant frequently with my oversea visitors and used to like this place. After the restaurant became popular, the service went bad and keeps adding additional charges. Wet towel is no longer charged by person and is now charged by each piece. The service staff is quite restrictive and sets of rule for client to follow, for example table was reserved ahead of time and the staff put me to the table by the stair way. I was the first client in the restaurant and I requested to change to another table by the side. After a bit of arugement, then the staff finally allowed to change the table for us. Bit of challenging to request of good service. Food is also requested to order ahead before letting customer in the restaurant. Not that good experience overall :

First time there, we had the creamy butter prawn, steamed fish, egg yolk pork ribs and salted egg crab. Creamy butter prawn was good, its deshelled and easy to eat (no fuss and clean fingers). Steamed fish was really fresh and the portion was pretty big. My todler loved it. My personal favourite is the salted egg yolk pork ribs. The meat is tender and its very easy to bite off the ribs. We ordered the salted egg crab, I was looking forward to taste the salted egg gravy/crab. Turns out the gravy is actually the soupy type and I find the taste so so; pretty bland. The crab was huge and the crab meat still however retains the sweetness n tenderness in its meat. Downside is that the queue took us about 40min. Pretty long wait but worth the it.
4
Bear in mind that even you've reserved a table you will have to wait for it, the food was worth the wait.
4
A restaurant worth visiting. It gets really crowded during weekends. So reserved your seat in advanced. Try to go on weekdays if possible.. environment is much more relax to enjoy food. Signature Claypot Crab Noodle is a must!! Will go back again.
5
We loved the clay pot vermicelli crab soup, so good! It was a hit. The soup is addicting! Can't wait to go back
3
Level two sitting quite cramp. One of the server toppled our drink but replaced with another. Crab and fish are fresh. Salted egg tastes nicer than butter crab.
5
We are always torn between ordering the Chili Crab and the Shimmering Crab, so the solution is ORDER BOTH! The chili crab has just the right amount of heat mixed with the sweet-sour-salty goodness to tantalize your taste buds. I love the creamy richness with the earthy flavor of curry leaves in the Shimmering Sand crab. Don't forget to order Fried Mantou to soak up all that precious sauce. Yummy for the tummy!
2
Ordered 2 small crabs (cause no big crabs available that day) and was charged $45 for EACH crab and a mushroom vege dish. Bill came up to $122. We told staff that we didn't want the side dishes and wet napkins but they pretended not to notice and we had to repeat this request 4 times before they responded! Nothing special about their dishes. For same amount of money, I believe you can have a much better crab meal elsewhere. Thumbs down
4
We ordered 5 dishes :1. Beancurd Combination2. Chilli Crab3. Crispy Nestum Prawn4. Stir-fried Assorted Veg5. Playboy Chicken6. Mellben Fried RiceThe chilli crab was really fresh. Sauce was tasty...one of the better chilli crabs I have tasted. The chicken was nice too. The fried rice is out-of-this-world. Very special
5
I've tried food at this outlet multiple times before. But the last visit was way back in 2014 so I was a lil worried by all the recent bad reviews on Facebook. However everything went really well.Easily made a reservation for 10 on chope. The service was quick and friendly and the food was excellent as I remembered. My mum and aunties and uncles certainly had an awesome time
4
Quite a lot bloggers recommend this restaurant for its prize-winning Crab. We tried the black pepper one, quite good but I prefer Chilli Crab in Jumbo Seafood. Other dishes recommended by the restaurant are also good. The location is just not convenient...go only if you have many days in Singapore...otherwise you will find very time consuming to go there. There is nothing else around the restaurant so you will go only for a mealTake MRT to Braddel station and then walk around 15minutes to the restaurant.
3
The crab soup beehoon (the soup) tasted different from the one in AMK.. The one at AMK was better and the serving was pretty small compared to the AMK one.. They gave very little noodles and soup which the server kept asking us if we want to add $8 for extra serving of noodles and soup. The one at AMK had way more beehoon and soup.
5
Delicious chilli crab restaurant. There is often a crowd so booking in advance is recommended. They also do takeaway. Good place to come for dinner.
5
Very nice food, black pepper crab and soup with crab are must try ones. Outdoor sitting is not very pleasent while plenty of little insects fly around.
4
yearly affair. Food is good but the service is only so-so. Probably because they are too busy. Overall is quite good! Recommended!
5
I always come here every time my mom is around coz she loves crabs and this place never disappoints. Creamy butter crabs, black pepper crabs and their fried tofu dipped in creamy butter sauce are highly recommended. Truly worth the money you pay for!
3
Crab was not as juicy n big as my previous trip. Wasabi prawn was nice. Avg to me. Staff informed if want big crab must inform during booking. Take note.
4
Despite long waiting for our dishes to be served, they have maintained their standard of crab and other dishes' well. Nothing to pick on in terms of quality, but it is a bit pricey. However, quite disappointed when they did not react when I feedback on a strand of hair found in the top shell dish AND loose pieces of crab shell found in the vegetable dish. They were just trying to explain that the foreign objects could be caused by ourselves
2
I came with highly recommendation. It seem that only this Toa Payoh branch is allowed for reservation. Then you need to order before having a seat. If not, u will have to wait even you booked. So my case was, I ordered, told them not to come until my friend arrived, still the food come first. So if you are coming in a group, remember to come together
2
Our group of 5 was told that we can only have one 800g crab to go around because they had under ordered the day before. I thought crab was their signature.. Not even enough to have a quarter each. Like seriously?In the end, after some negotiation, we managed to have a 1.3 kg one to go around. Tried other food like their salted egg yoke ribs home made tofu, bean curd skin brocolli and wasabi prawn. The food was average at best.
1
Booking thought online. But due to I unable to attend ontime so I requested changed to another timing and the Customer service said ok. But when I reach there they say my booking is expire. I told them I spoke to your customer service and requested to change my time, but they denied
4
My friends and I enjoyed our meal at Mellben. We loved the salted egg crab, creamy butter prawns, sambal Kang Kong, Beancurd with mushrooms and crispy fried rice. However, the playboy chicken is very average only. The crabs are fresh, meaty and delicious. Service is good for a Coffeeshop restaurant but can be improved for a better experience. The taste of the food made the trip worthwhile. We simply loved the crab. We would be back for more. We spent less than $300 for a group of 8 persons, so the food value for mone
2
Ordered Butter creamy crab and Crab BeeHoon to my foreign friends but was disappointed. Crab and overcooked and not fresh and the crab been hoon turns out to be soggy. Seems to be placed for too long and den reheat it and serve.
5
Along with Chilli, buttter and bee hoon soup crabs are many other superb dishes you can order. ALL are super good!
4
Menu has expanded and this is certainly more interesting for regulars. Great food, prompt client service and follow-up. The must-haves are salted egg crabs, ice sweet sour pork, salted egg beans, claypot crab bee hon soup. I'll return soon again.
4
The last I tried their signature dish of the crab with vermiceli, it was better. My dad commented that the soup's fishy taste was too strong
4
The food is reasonably priced., portion and taste are good as well. Overall a very satisfactory visit.
4
There is a prc couple purposely cut queue, but the counter employee ask them to go behind to queue. Kudos to that!
5
Pepper crab is the best thing on the menu.. That good we ordered another one! Wow... Been to 3 other restaurants to eat pepper crab and this is the best one so far.. A little more expensive but not as pricey as jumbo or red house
2
We had to call three times for bill and they didnt inform us that we actually have to go to the counter for bill and made us waited for 20 mins. Same goes to the beverages. We had to order three times for a hot chrysanthemum. The price for the crab is overated. $58 dollar for 800g crab? I'm sure i can get a cheaper price for a bigger juicier crab at other restaurants.
4
I always take away chilli crab from Mellben because the taste nice and not far from my house. I call to order more than 10 times but nobody pick up the phone. Then, I thought should be crowded because no one pick up the phone, so I decided to go there order. However, when I reach there no customer wait, just got the customer eating.
4
Chilli crab is still good as ever...with the golden buns of course. The salted egg crab is a bit disappointing as the version is different from what we usually had at other places (creamy salted egg version). Mellben serves dry salted egg version and the presentation of the dish is very lacking. Bamboo clams compensates the dry salted egg crab dish.... love them with garlic, Mellben did well on this one! The pork rib (can't remember the dish name) is actually laksa flavored - interesting and a bit too spicy for my friends who can't take spiciness well. Overall is good, we have a good CNY dinner gathering with good friends!
5
Had a great meal here with colleagues. The food came quickly and was top notch. I would definitely recommend and will be back!
4
I like this Melben branch as it is less crowded as compare to AMK branch. Their CRAB BEEHUN SOUP IS DA BOOM!
4
I always bring SG visitors to Mellben. Often they say this is their favorite meal. We all leave happy :)
1
Food taste is not very good and crab is not fresh. The price consider a bit higher, no value for money
1
The reception staff attitude can be improve, i left with a bad after taste no matter how good the food is.
4
Reservation process is fairly simple. Will recommend to friends and will definitely visit again. A bit pricey though.
5
if you want to have some delicate dinner or lunch with a very nice taste for salted egg crab then do not hesitate to come to MELLBEN SEAFOOD the one they have at TOA PAYOH.the dishes in here is absolutely totally delicious!! don't forget to ask for their salted egg pork ribs and also beehoon crab. OMG..!! too good to be true!
1
The food is not bad. But service very rude we found. The waitess who look like a man with glasses very rude to us. They teased us when we paid bill to double price and laughed when see our react. And told us its an error. So, we dont have a problem to pay the bill even you double price but what you did it was very rude service for tourist
1
1) Arrived on time for our reservation but they refuse to bring us to our table and insisted that we should make our order 1st before giving us the table at the counters we are carrying 2 of our young kids age 4 and 2at our hands what the hurry that u want us to make orders?2) Sis-in-law orded the lime juice and she waited for almost 15 min for her lime juice to serve to her after alot of reminded given to the waitress. 3) missing Dish order at counter was not serve when we make a check is actually waiter never include in the order 4) Their so call new dish taste terriable especially the veg tofu!?
5
Visited this restaurant with colleagues from Hong Kong and they loved the dishes, especially the signature claypot crab beehoon, salted egg crab and chilled sweet and sour pork.And the price was very reasonable too. The bill came up to just over S$200 for the 5 of us
4
Great food, as usual. However did not open up the second storey dining area even though it was super warm and packed.
4
Dishes prepared by the restaurant are good, just that the crabs that we ordered came only towards the end. Go early so you won't hit the dinner crowd!
3
Definitely a must place if youre searching for great seafood. The service a little dissappointed. Dont forget to order mantao and also chilli crab and my fave is salted egg crab!! Yummyyyy
4
Tofu was my favorite, must try it!! Black Pepper Crab was too salty for me. Rib was awesome, I love that spicy. The outdoor environment is loud.
5
Vermicelli Crab Soup is very nice.
Recommended with 5 stars.
Just only Chilli Crab need more improvement.
2
Food wise was as per my title ~ perhaps i expected too much from all the reviews and comparison done with AMK branch. Service was poor, unattented and unfriendly staff add on to bad experience.
Do not consider coming back to this branch.
2
Everybody has recommended me this place for seafood. So finally I went there.First it has been a nightmare to book a table... Got one, went there with very high expectations... And a big disappointment!!! First it's over rated! Secondly quality wasn't there...Black pepper crab wasn't good, cereal prawns just ok, the rice with no taste... Very disappointing experience... Unlike everybody, I DO NOT recommend this place! It was the Toa Payoh branch. ! Don't know about Ang Mo Kio...but wouldn't wanna try.I'm done with Mellben...
2
Foods are okay, but are overpriced.Stuffs attitude are bad. Ask him any recommendation for dish as we are first timer, he just anyhow point to the menu. Please lor, I also know how to see the menu, then i won't ask for any recommendation already right. Won't go back again
5
Arrived early by half hour allocated level 2 air conditioned table. Elderly Auntie who took our order is very friendly. Food arrived quickly. Very tasty and crabs were fresh. First time visit will definitely be back in future! Good place to bring visitors. Price is very reasonable with the type of quality food you need not pay double triple the price in big brand seafood restaurants. Long beach and jumbo no need to visit anymore.
3
This is a branch of Mellben Seafood in AMK. The quality was ok to good dishes comparing to the original one. I ordered the chili crabs, claypot crab and salted egg crabs. The chili crab were not so spicy as original, the clay pot was ok, but lacking a bit of juiciness to it, and the salted egg was barely any salted egg, mostly baking flour
3
Service was not timely and food was really a disappointment. Was really expecting better standard for the food.
3
the pricing of the crab was expensive and might be due to the Low in supple for this season. Crab given to us was small in size and the man Tou that we ordered was small, burnt n tough. Service was average only.
1
Crabs were of poor quality and obviously not fresh. Bamboo clams were overcooked, taste rubbery and overpowered with raw garlic. Tofu in tofu dish was cold as if uncooked. There was nothing I particularly liked.
5
This is my 2nd trip (Toa Payoh Branch) and really enjoy our dinner... the food is delicious, service is good and will go there again......
5
One of the best carb stall you have in Singapore. Not to be miss. The quality and the standard is always the same.
4
This is always a busy restaurant and they serve tasty crabs. It is busy but not as crazily busy as the other outlet.
4
Food was great, the price was decent for the food. However was informed that the second floor is off limits during lunch.
4
Fresh and tasty crabs though alittle small.. Golden beancurd is not up to expectation but nevertheless it was a decent dish. Fortune chicken taste yummy but a little pricey though. However my guest are satisfy with the meal.
3
Searched for best chilli crab in Singapore and a website listed this in top 5. Believing is in the tasting, and the chilli crab was nice but not as delicious as we've tried elsewhere. Service was ok, seating etc a bit Spartan. Price was acceptable ($60sd) for the crab. In future looking elsewhere.
1
The waiters on the 2nd level are very unhappy. Either they purposely ignored us or they have hearing issues. When the food was served, after waiting for a long while, we had to request for the rice. The rice wouldn't have come if we didn't request, even though we had ordered the rice before hand. The price is not worth the service, the crab beed hoon less than satisfying after encountering such snobbish attitude
4
Deep fried cripsy crabs, you can eat all of it with out any left. Have so many varities menu of shrimp and crap. Not to hard to find just take MRT and walk about 10 mins.
3
Overall the reservation manner is a big improvements.The food standard seems drop slightly, we were there at ard 7.10pm waited almost 45 mins before food is serve.... that i think is too long and is not really that 'full house'
5
Focus on crab cause previously tried others, so so only. Strongly recommend salted egg crab and also Bee Hoon crab. Yum yum.
4
though bit pricey, they serve good food and provide good services. the food came promptly after we ordered. The amount of food came was right and the sizes were determined by the waiter who took our order.
5
One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. Usually order salted egg crab and crab noodles in clay pot, tofu with creamy butter sauce, mixed veggies. Clean, fast and efficient service.
4
Crab noodles is super nice and recommended. I like the chilled sweet and sour pork too, uniquely nice. However, I agree that the service staff here is quite rude. We waited for about 15 mins to be served / request a table.
2
The service sucks. Waiters and waitresses got attitude problems.
Asking for more soup need to wait 30mins long.
5
An amazing place, and I go there on every visit to Singapore. Kelly Soon, the owner has lots of traditional as well as innovative dishes of her own.Their Butter Crab is #1. All their Crab preparations are A-1. Their Fried Rice is hands-down the best in Singapore. Try also their "Cereal Prawns".In fact, I would recommend EVERYTHING that they offer. I have tried everything that they serve, and have never been disappointed. This is the place to eat in when you are in Singapore
3
The owners should look at expanding the place. With 12 tables in a "5room flat space", we need to shout just to talk to each other.And, please look into having someone that has basic customer service at the cashier counter. Never mentioned if NETS was allowed, my ma pass her nets card to the China cashier and he went on to swipe it without confirming if it's a credit card. Then tell my ma (exactly word to word) "this card cannot use" with a black face.
1
Never say negative stuffs on the social platform, but I had to comment on the poor service provided by the staff manning the queue/order taking is one of the worst experience I ever had.We were slam with a rude tone that if you order 2 or more crabs, they won't guarantee it will comes with pincers. HUH? Your specialty is crabs and how is that acceptable?If it wasn't a gathering with a bunch of close friends, we will definitely walk away. The food quality has drop so much. Crab bee hoonâ€™s serving is small and the salted egg crabs are more dry than juicy
5
Great service, delicious food, value for money, lots of food variety....i will definitely go this restaurant again my next SG trip.
5
All the staffs were very keen to help providing excellent service to the table, be it food ordering (recommendation and explanation one dishes) and reheating the food as one of our members joined us later.
1
terrible service. no point booking as you will need to queue even when you have a booking. You have to queue to order BEFORE you can have a table. What ridiculous process is this.
3
Average but very crowded restaurant. Some dishes are delicious, some are not. The price is not cheap at all. Sometime have to wait for a long time in arranging tables and preparing food.
4
We ordered the signature Claypot Crab Bee Hoon, Stout Pork Ribs, Cereal Prawns, Sambal Kang Kong and Claypot Beancurd. Our group was happy with the quality of food served.The portion was also huge. As prior reservation was made, we didn't need to wait for the table. The only drawback was the slow service of the staff. We wanted to top up the soup to the crab bee hoon, waited for more than 15 minutes before we alerted the same staff again. Apparently, he did not follow up on our request the first time.
5
I'd always gone to No Sign Board for my fix of white pepper crab when in Singapore but after reading one reviewer's comments about how the meat comes off easily at Mellben, I though I would give it a try since tony biggest complaint about NSB was that you could not get the meat off the crab!Suffice it to say that I doubt I will be going back to NSB. The quality of the crab was higher than NSB and as promised, the meat came off the crab much easier than other restaurants I had been to. The only issue is that everyone seemed to have ordered a crab pot dish with noodles in it...no one ordered the white pepper crab...I will have I try that dish the next time I visit.
4
A friend took me to this restaurant as I said I wanted to have a genuine Singapore Chilli Crab. I did and it was delicious! The Sri Lankan crab was a good size and the flesh was succulent and full flavoured. The shell was pre-cracked to make the eating as easy as possible but don't be shy you need to be prepared to mess up those hands and fingers to really get stuck into and enjoy this dish. The small fried breads to dip into the sauce are wonderful. It was so good we went back again two nights later. This time I had the Pork Ribs in a Guinness Sace and the Wasabi Prawns. Both dishes were really tasty but the Wasabi were outstanding. The light bite of the wasabi mustard in a creamy sauce coating and big juicy prawns. Washed down with a large bottle of Becks beer this was a great meal.The restaurant itself is very casual and nothing fancy. It really is all about the food. The prices weren't cheap but not too expensive and the quality is strong. The service was a bit hit and miss. Some staff very friendly others looking a bit bored, but they were all very efficient.I'd happily go again
1
Reserved a table but yet had to wait for one when we got there. Crabs were more expensive then other famous places. Overall price was expensive for a place located in the heartlands with no aircon.Service was bad and waiter had attitude! Asked waiter for recommendations/specialties of which is said its personal preferences instead of giving us recommendations! Would rather go to Long Beach for cheaper crab and better environment
2
Many Singapore people recommend this restaurant to me, but I don't think it's good. I know they have different branches, & I visited the branch in "Toa Payoh ". I tried more than 4 different crab restaurants in this trip, but this one is the worst one
1
Even with a booking, we were made to wait till everyone arrive and decide on our food orders before we can be seated at the table. Being 1st time to the restaurant and with 11 foreigners it's actually very frustrating to make standing even though many tables were empty. 
3
Food is not bad and price is reasonable. Booking with Chope was fast and convenient.
This is a very local flavor restaurant in a HDB housing estate.
Crab Beehoon was good.
1
1. Food is no longer as good.
2. Unbelievably expensive.
3. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BILLS HERE BEFORE HANDING OVER YOUR CARD! (They also tried to pull a fast one on me by providing an inflated bill!!! )
4
Good to find Mellben with reservation available, location is not convenient to tourists but food is almost the same as that at Ang Mo Kiu.
4
Crab beehoon soup is a must try! The rest of the dishes are quite delicious as well. Will definitely go back for more!
2
Made a reservation for this outlet because the Ang Mo Kio branch was full. When we arrived on time, our table has not yet been prepared. Food was served shortly after we ordered but quality is not as good as the Ang Mo Kio branch. The service at this outlet is rather appalling. We were unceremoniously charged for the wet tissues when we indicated that we didn't want them. The cashier lady rudely told us that the bill has already been printed out so there's nothing she/we can do about it. Felt like she was just too lazy to print out the corrected bill and simply wanted us to pay $0.40 each for a packet of wet tissue that we do not even want to use. In fact, it is not about the money; her attitude was just horrible. Will never patronise this outlet ever again
1
This Mellben outlet at Toa Payoh has really poor service. I made a reservation via Chope successfully (I even confirmed my reservation via Chope's automated phone service on that day) but they did not have my records in the end. I was then asked to wait for an estimated 20 minutes even though I had made a reservation. What is the point of me making a reservation when I still have to wait for my table then? Their queueing & ordering system is bad too. People have to queue to order first before being seated, and if you want to add on orders after that you have to go back and queue all over again. The worse part is that they said they were short-handed and this is how they operate. Totally no form of customer service at all. If you know that your restaurant will be busy on a PH evening, you should have allocated more manpower, and even if they were short-handed, that's not the right way to speak to customers. They were all good and fine before the renovation, but seems like they have become more arrogant after that. Food wise it's still good as always, but I will not return to this outlet ever again. The Mellben outlet at Pasir Ris is so much better with their service and whatnot. Don't really understand why people are still wasting their time queueing for this outlet. Really bad experience here
3
In an old central neighbourhood, this branch has more parking lots and a more spacious waiting area in the open than the original outlet. Other than their delicious signature crab vermicelli soup, the other dishes are average and probably what you can get at the usual zi char stalls. Waiting time is still as long if you do not have a reservation but it is impressive how they have invested in technology to improve their efficiency with the use of iPads for the queue system and ordering
2
Standard drop big time. Crab selling at $58 for 1 not by weight. order 1 chilli and 1 cream. Crab was small, meat was soft and not solid. No point purposely travel there to eat, any zi char stall tat sell crab is equivalent to their now and save e 5% service charge coz zi char stall won't charge
4
I recommend to make a reservation otherwise no table for you. Rice noodles with crab is very good, crab is big and very fresh sweet. Rice noodles absorbed the soup which is very fresh sweet. Another one is 甘香骨, a little bit of spicy but also very good ! Overall, the food and service is very good 
4
We ordered kam heong crab, salted egg yolk prawn, claypot noodle crab and bamboo clam. The kam heong crab has a bit of curry flavor and we ordered some fried mantao to go with it too. The claypot noodle crab was really good, a must try. But I find their salted egg yolk prawns were lacked of salted egg yolk taste. Overall, their seafood is fresh
2
Crabs were small, cereal prawn was bad and the service was mediocre.
Butter crab sauce and toufu in a wok was decent though.
4
we ordered claypot crab with bee hoon and butter crab. All were tasty!
But, I thought the staff could be nicer to the customers and explained clearly about the price of the appetizers.
1
Don't understand what's the hype over this restaurant. No ambience ( like aircon coffee shop ) Quality of food is not restaurant type - teenage daughter remarks even worse than Zhi Cha. We ordered 2 crabs - was told tht they sell their crabs by "standard size", not weight. Each crab supposed to be 800g. We ordered 2 crabs , one was approx 800g , the other was definitely much smaller. Both crabs tasted bland - like frozen crab! When the bill came, it was a shocker. $58 for 800g crab that is NOT FRESH, probably FROZEN cos it tasted really bland!! The casher said tht 1 kg crab is $72.50!! Can u believe charging that price for small frozen crabs??!! This is my FIRST and LAST time to patronise this "restaurant"!! What a RIP OFF!
4
First time having salted egg yolk crab for me and I think I just found a new favorite preparation for crab. The savory salted egg yolk elevates this fried crab dish and brings out the sweetness of the crab. I just wanted to gather the crab roe and salted egg yolk to make a "crabonara" sauce to throw with some pasta. The crab with tung hoon dish had a nice fragrance and this peppery preparation of crab was truly delicious too. As before the crab is incredibly sweet and nicely counterpointed by the black pepper. Lastly, the crab bee hoon soup was just sublime. I could drink that sweet and savory broth for days on end. Honestly can't remember too much about this crab because the broth was just that good. All in all, we had a nice variety of crab preparations and they were all yummy in their own unique ways. You would think other dishes would suffer when you are known for one thing, which in Melben's case is crab, but their other dishes are pretty decent too. From the garlic veggies to salt and pepper pork chops to the cuttlefish youtiao, the dishes were pretty pretty tasty although relegated to playing back up to the crabs. My aunt called ahead to reserve a table and our crabs and I think y'all should too. As everyone has mentioned, you need to come early otherwise you're out of luck. Or as I would like to think, feeling really crabby for the rest of the night
3
Was invited by friends for dinner at this outlet as I recalled I was there many years back , despite making reservations , were told that if the whole group is not there we cannot be seated which is really strange as the place is not really full since we made an early reservations at 6:00 pm!!Was made to order food before even seated and we finally got to order our food and get seated. Upstairs where it is air conditioned and seated , a nice old lady came to take our drinks order and her warmth and attentive service made up for the service we had downstairs.Food was served pretty fast and taste though acceptable are not the best crabs I had tried given there are so many choicesin Singapore . We ordered 2 versions of the crabs which was the creamy and soup based. The crabs are not huge and the creamy version was too thick to my liking and the soup version was better.Other dishes are just passable and not perhaps too much hype on this place.Overall the price is also expensive considering the place and also the serving size .
2
I can't understand what the hype is all about. The service is bad, it's not a restaurant (some food republic foodcourt are actually nicer!), there is no a/c and the staff is rude. They don't list prices on their menu even though their prices are fixed - and since the staff is rude you don't feel like asking.The food is average (black pepper crab was too salty) and the price exagerated (we paid around 150sgd for 2 persons).The food wasn't bad but because of the poor service and the uexplained high prices, I'm not going back to Mellben
5
we decided to try sth local and avoid other touristy restaurant. Our local friend brought us here to try different kinds of crabs. We ordered chilli crab, blackpepper crab, and the signature dish-the crab in the pot with noodle and yellow soup(sorry i cant rmb the name) and stirfried kailan and shrimppaste chicken. There are all so good! Especially the blackpepper crab. I really like the signature crab soup because you will feel the taste of the crab in the soup as well. The chilli crab is sth like xe-shuan soup with lots of eggs. They give you a lots of sauce, you can order buns to dip in it. They normally use hands to eat the crabs - quite a mess if u're not a professional crab eater. The restaurant give you a wet paper. Please also bring your own napkin as well. 3 crabs+1 veggie+1fried chicken cost around $250. Please be there before 6 as people start to queue up for table. You can reserve the table in advance. You can take a bus from MRT toa payoh around a quick 10 stop
3
Service was poor. When we reach nobody served ask if we make a reservation, we just randomly sat before someone usher us for a table for 3. Was only given one menu and the service crew is all gone busy having their meal at the table behind, using phone or talking among themselves. When we was ready for order, everybody just ignore and simply doing their own stuffs. Finally someone called the young china man to take our order, no recommendation nothing (his attitude like doesn't even wanted to serve us or as if we irritate him at the counter doing his stuffs), we ordered according to the deceiving picture of the menu only. Our first dish the spicy pork rib, the dish look pipping hot outside but after first few bites this dish actually been cooled for some times we suppose (This dish costed $18 ! ). Then our main dish the claypot been hoon. We wanted a female crab actually but they did not ask nor we mention also so it's ok (at AMK outlet the waiter will ask what kind of crab etc) and this dish is so salty that we needed to order more drinks! We wasn't serve the tool to crack the crab too we need to walk to the cashier counter or looking around to SELF-SERVICE ourselves before one staff handed us, the meat was a little sticky with the shell. Proceed to cashier and settle the bill, there's a service charges which was quite redundant. Total we paid $91.80nett. Will not come back at all. Visited the Ang Mo Kio outlet most of the times, first time trying this outlet as Chope only can make reservation for TPY outlet, very disappointed.

Supposed to be famous for its crab dishes, but what we got was so so only. Lady who took our orders even said the quality of the crab today was not very good - imagine coming all the way to a crab restaurant and ordering something else - I cannot imagine why a restaurant famous for its crabs would have lousy suppliers - perhaps they didn't really care - we ordered a few other dishes also - food is passable enough and I would hv given this restaurant an average rating. However what got my goat was their McDonalds style order taking. All the customers had to queue outside the restaurant and wait for their turn to place orders, before being given a table inside....and this is only if you have made a reservation. If you have not...then expect to wait at least 30 mins.There was a crowd today, and the order queue was not very organized. Later when we were done eating, paying for the bill was cash only...because their credit card terminal was not working. Good thing there was a Posb Atm nearby. Else it might have become even more inconvenient. Overall attitude of the service staff was take it or leave it. Definitely not worth the while. Take your money elsewhere. There are plenty of other crab restaurants in Singapor

Last we visited Mellben 2 years ago. When we place order, the lady inform us that the crab is "small size & will cost $58 & the meat might not be good/firm"... we were like "what?" u can sell these kind of stuff for $58???...trying to cover their butt in case the crab turn up lousy quality.. common! where is that Mellben "quality" that set your name in the early days? It is your duty to ensure you buy quality crab right?Food was average because there are a lot of restaurants having these quality nowadays & some at cheaper price. Don't think it was really worth the price.

Everyone I know loves the crab bee hoon soup at Mellben, and will sometimes rave about the salted egg crab. Personally I was blown away by the mee tai bak and cereal prawns. No complaints, not even one.
4
this place serves pretty delicious food. I especially enjoyed the flavourful signature clay pot crab bee hoon soup.The soup was creamy and rich in the taste of crab. Other dishes such as the tofu, Guinness pork ribs and samba kangkung were also good.

Excellent quality black pepper crab and fast service, good place for a dinner or a late evening snack.

i brought my friends from the US to visit Melben, a restaurant i used to love and used to be cheaper than jumbo/long beach. if i knew that crabs costs 800g for $58 (it's now May 2015) and only came in 1 size, ie all 800g only. i would have gone to jumbo/long beach for crabs.crab beehoon is best when the crabs are big, where the crab meat is juicy. having crabs of just 800g size is pathetic. this is probably my last visit to melben. food was alright, but it used to be a lot better and also better service. i guess all the hype has made melben seafood forgot it used to be, and still is a neighbourhood restaurant.next time when i have visitors from overseas, i'm just going to bring them to jumbo seafood. i made a comparison in prices with what we ordered in jumbo vs melben. it's only a little bit more expensive in jumbo, which makes up for the cab fare to melben. dear tourists, this restaurant is not worth your time

Always a fan for crabs and have been visiting Mellben Seafood TPY for the past years for most special occasions. However, the recent visit has proved to be quite disappointing due to poor food quality and standard. In the past, the restaurant has always been able to cope with high volume of customers and good quality of food but guess not this time round
2
Despite reserving for table, one has to queue to order food before a table will be allocated. There are two queues, one for walkins n the other for those with reservations. The waitress kept taking order for the walkin queue. So what is the point of making reservations.

Great crabs and seafood in a charming typical Singapore suburban setting. There are fancier places to eat seafood, but let's face it, crabs are just messy no matter what you do. If your friends object, get new friends.Recommend the salted egg crab and the crab bee hoon.Tip: Turn up with at least half your group, or they won't seat you. They'll be nice about it - but the fact is that they're busy even on a Monday night, so turnover is everything.

Revisited for dinner. The dishes were still as good. We managed to reserve a table at the first level (no air-con), food does not get cold easily, and the service charge is lower compared to tables at the 2nd level (with air-con).Maybe the crabs were not in season, they were relatively smaller ($55 for one). However they tasted as good
4
Ive been to the Ang Mo Kio location a few times and that was always packedThis location was no differentFood quality is clearly high (as any place in Singapore that is busy will be) and service is as what you expect - quick, snappy and with no smilesRecommendations would be the butter crab and the cereal prawnNote: there is a small surcharge if you eat upstairs.....you're basically paying for the cost of their aircon
4
We tried the simmering sand crab, salted egg with cheese and the signature clay pot crab bee hoon soup. The best is still the bee hoon soup. It was delicious as usual, service was fast too. It is advisable to make a reservation to avoid long wait
4
Best crab place in Singapore. Service was also excellent. If you like seafood make sure to drop by this restaurant. Long queues but worth it.
4
The food service was quick and efficient, the Crab beehoon claypot was tasty, as many have attested to it. But at $55 per crab regardless of weight it seems a little dear.
2
Don't try it. One of my colleague dine w me ate a plastic piece from their fried veg. I black listed that branch since then!
4
We had a business dinner here with 6 people. We had chili crab, fish, prawns and other delicious food. Service was good and we didn't have to wait to be seated. This is not a fancy restaurant and outside the tourist area. It is typical of Singapore dining. We will return.

Had a night of "crabbing" with friends from out of town. We had Crab Bee Hoon, Pepper Crab and Salted Eggs Crabs. All of them were very delicious. The Crab Bee Hoon was flavourful and we finished every drop of the soup. Pepper Crab was good, not too peppery spicy like some other places. The Salted Eggs Crabs were so nice that we had a second order! Service could be better, it was hard getting their attention for drinks order. Overall, we did have a good "crabbing" time
2
I visit Melben every time I visit Singapore as I used to enjoy the crab bee hoon soup. However, my last visit was a disappointment, the food is now very average but very expensive, The new look is a lot more pleasant but that does not justify the cost
2
Seen reviews that this place is one of the Must Visit restaurant to try crabs in SG. But honestly , it isn't as good as it seemed. Service is okay but the food , definitely not special , comparable to Jumbo Seafood at ECP. Drinks are expensive as well. Costly to dine at Mellben too. Definitely not visiting Mellben Seafood Restaurant again. Full review , please visit ext-wanderlust.blogspot.s

I was going over to my girlfriend 's place for dinner. I passed by mellben (very near my place) thinking of getting a chilli crab for her. So I went to the shop and did my ordering. After I told the prc girl that I just want one chilli crab for take away(tabao). She gave me that look and ask me 'just one'? I said yes and told her it's for one person share,a small one will do. She gave me that second look as though I'm that kind of cheapo guy. 'Hello, it's for my girlfriend,what's wrong with just buying one crab.' I waited a while and the same girl came back with the take away. Guess what! $80 for a chilli crab!!! I asked the second time how much and she gave me that look again and replied 80. I asked her 'this! For one person ? She said yes. I didn't argue I just paid n left. Seriously, damn ex and bad experience. Bye bye Mellben no more..

I have been to this restaurant a few times and each time i find the crabs there are simply awesome.White pepper & shimmering sand crabs are our favorite & highly recommended. These crabs are fresh & delicious.This restaurant has a better ambience after the renovation

Went to Mellben on 8th Nov 2013 arnd 830pm. not much ppl in line. We were served by a china male guy while waiting in line and he took our order. As we wanted a bigger chilli crab, he recommended us to take 2 smaller 800g crabs instead of 1 1kg crab. When we asked him how big was it, this was at a point he tried to smoke us. Cos basically there were sample sizes for the crabs on a chair nearby and he didnt bother to show us, didnt bother to reference us with his hands as example and just told us 2 800g crabs will b sufficient for us. So we ordered 2 800g crabs for chilli crabs n another 1kg for crab mee hoon and a seafood tofu.It was only after 10 mins another malaysian chinese staff came over to our table after we were seated and asked us if we can finish the 3 crabs as they were quite alot. So i asked her the same qn, which she then pointed and beckon me over to see how big the sample crabs were. I was stunned at first there were sample sizes close to where we were queueing but the china guy didnt bother to show us. His nonchalant heck care attitude and the fact he was trying to rip us off goes to show how irresponsible he was and just wanted to take us for carrotheads. So we changed our order to 2 1 kg crabs, one for chilli and one for crab mee hoon. Overall, waiting time was long abt 30 mins despite it was getting late and not much of a queue. Tasted okay in summary, the crab mee hoon was cooked with black pepper sauce, mee hoon was dry type and crabmeat was not really seasoned with pinch of dryness. Chilli crab not really fantastic. Seafood tofu was nt bad. For the price of $140 paid for 2 ppl, considered quite exp.Uncle leong which has moved to toa payoh tech park still has better crabs despite both being coffeeshops, mellben just charges more for its posh setting. If u guys are planning to try out Melben, try to have a staff other than china prc to serve you, cos ultimately end of day, i wont trust them at all based on this lousy experience i had with them. Never ask china prc to recommend cos they will definitely rip you off instead of being concerned whether u can finish the crabs itself

It is a bit pricey for Singapore but the food is fantastic.
It is advisable to arrive early as within 30 minutes of us having arrived around 6pm, the restaurant was packed with a long queue.
4
Very long queue but when you have your first bite, it's worth the pain. Butter crab, salted egg crab, crab in soup are my recommendation. Don't believe me. Check this restaurant yourself.

The price is not cheap while food is so-so compared to the first branch.I went with my colleague sometime ago in the evening, but it's disappointment. We went there since we want to avoid the queue. We ordered a vegetable dish but somehow there is a small piece of plastic in it. My colleague was unlucky, she took a piece of vegetable with it.Although its probably not intentionally, but we stopped going to that branch after that incident

I live in the US but am a regular traveler to Singapore, in fact I go there every other month and have been doing so for years. Mellben at Toa Payoh is my absolutely favorite place to eat, and I make sure that I go there at least once or twice on every trip!My absolute favorite is their Butter Crab. Heavenly! I cannot handle chillies so the staff is very accommodating and prepare it specially for me without chillies. I also enjoy their "cereal prawns"... HUGE juicy prawns, crispy on the outside, moist, tender and flavorful inside. Their Fried Rice is the best in Singapore, far better than the overpriced "fried rice specialists" such as Chen Fu Ji and others. I have never had a bad meal at Mellben. Kelly Soon the owner works hard to keep up their high standards. The greatest testimony to the quality of their food is that Mellben is always full of diners enjoying their meal. People from all over the island go there to eat and it is always full every day of the week.....

Make a reservation on a weekends but they decline me and claimed that they only took reservation for more than 10 pax!!!Lesser than that would be walk in!!!We arrive around 1815 hrs, restaurant was almost full house!!! Make our order at the hostess area!!! 3 wait staff approach us for the same question 'how many people' We were direct to our table after ordering!!!Waiting about 20 minutes!!! For the first dish arrive!!! Taste excellent especially the crab!!! We order 2 crab and ask to serve 1 follow by another!!! But disappoint came they serve both together!!! We wanted to ensure it is hot while eating as crab take time to eat!!! Restaurant was pack and queue started!!! After paying the servers stated to clear!!! They anyhow throw the cutleries where all the sauce splash on my bag that on the chair. Food is nice yes but the service really have to improve!!! Please be more gentle!!! You are serving human not animals!!! Give some personal touch!!

We have been here recently and I was happy I could make a booking in advance as there was already a queue building up when we arrived. For starters we had their Guiness Stout Pork Ribs which literally fell off the bone. We also ordered Claypot Bee Hoon, Chili and Black Pepper Crabs. The Bee Hoon Crab is very tasty in it's buttery sauce, the Chili Crab was slightly too sweet for me but the Black Pepper Crab must be the best I've had so far. The thick peppery gravy with onions gave the sweet crab meat a great kick. Also the crabs we did get served were super meaty and fresh.Setup is simple coffeshop style but all staff is very friendly and bring the food with a smile to the table which, together with quality food, makes Mellben one of my new favorite seafood places.For my full review and pictures please check out my blog http://getmygrubon.wordpress.com/2013/02/20/mellben-seafood-toa-payoh-singapore/ Get Your Grub On! :

Every single person (exaggerating a little, but you get the point.) that have been to Singapore before will swear that the crabs here are one of the highlight of their trip, and one of the best restaurant you can find to satisfy your crab cravings will be at mellben Seafood Restaurant, with 2 outlets in singapore;1) 232 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 (main)2) Lorong 8 Toa Payoh, Blk 211 it is undeniably the most well-liked restaurant by Singaporeans, with hundreds of crab shells (cleaned) hanging around the sign board of the shop. The top pick of crab dishes you should try here will be the ever popular chili crab, and the crab bee hoon, which is a Singaporean's favourite for the smooth bee hoon and delicious soup.Do note that if you are deciding to have your meal here, do come early, as the que for the restaurant usually starts as early as 3pm, even during non-peak weekdays. and if you are around during dinner time, the que can sometimes take up to 2hrs before you can even get a seat

I've been to this restaurant a few times now with a group of friends and never have we been disappointed. The crab is delicious - have tried the Chilli, Black Pepper, Bee Hoon and Butter varieties. Also love the spicy salt prawns and the Guiness ribs - all lovely washed down with a beer or lime juice.We use the outdoor seating and soak up the atmosphere of the place. It is a little hard to communicate sometimes as few of the staff speak much English, but this has never got in the way of us having an enjoyable dinner

among my favorite food in the world is their Shimmering Butter Crab, sans bee hoon. i can just drink the sauce like a youth elixir, forget about the calorie bomb. paired with fried mantou, it's heavenly.however, my last visit at AMK stall was dissapointing due to non-english speaking waiter who was downward rude. we can't order small size crab and had to take 2, but can't cook it in 2 sauce (we wanted the butter sauce and black pepper). they just refused so rudely, we opted to the nearby Boon Tong Kee because we just lost our appetite.i'd rather go to the not-so-nice stall in Toa Payoh for a nicer service. the queue and waiting time in AMK tends to be longer too. think would be great idea if they have a nicer establishment in TPY

Considering the very rustic nature of the restaurant and the long queue we had to endure to eat there, I was expecting exceptional food, since this was really an out-of-the-way hole in the wall. Their much praised crab is really... average. I liked the butter crab, but their famous bee hon crab was nothing special. It was like crab in a thin nearly tasteless milky broth with what looked like spaghetti noodles.I did enjoy their wasabi prawns and fried rice, but the pork and chicken dishes we ordered were both forgettable.The service was very varied. One waitress was very rude and dismissive of our requests, while one waiter was very accommodating (I'm guessing since he was apparently charmed by one of girls at our table).When you look at the place, the service, and the quality of the food, it was really quite overpriced. I'd expect similar prices at clean places with air conditioning, not in a place that looks the way this restaurant did.By the way, they do accept credit cards for the food, but you'll need to settle all beverages ordered with cash
