As with most good Japanese outlets, it is quite pricy, but the food is definitely worth the price. Outstanding food.

Just had a wonderful dinner here, chef kobayashi makes our evening memorable! Had their omagasay shin menu! Generous portions and fulfilling! Great sashimi and sushi!! Will be back again for sure!!

Over-priced with over-rated reviews. Was quite excited about my experience but end with a disappointment.
5
went there for lunch. really enjoyed the fresh and delicious sushi. service is good. the place is nice. one of the best sushi place in Singapore. really recommended for lunch.

Went with my wife for our anniversary. Ordered the sushi menu and it was delicious. The flavor and temperature of the rice was just right and the fishes and other ingredients were top notch. We had a great evening and lots of fun chatting with the chef. Definitely will be returning there despite the hefty bill

This restaurant cane highly recommended by friends and been here the second time and I am still impressed. Upon entering the restaurant you will be greeted and led to your seats. It’s best to sit at the counter where you can watch the chef prepare your sushi. There are limited seating at the counter so we have booked a day in advance. They have the sushi meals and the omakase meals. Quality of food is great. Fish served is fresh and the chef will tell you each he serves. The service attendants are very attentive, refilling our tea and sake before we emptied our cups or glasses. Price wise, it is on the high side but it is well worth it.

I’m a Japanese Food Lover, wherever i go and whenever i always looked for the Japanese Food. I’ve been many times to go to Sin, many times to go to Japanese restaurant but this is my very first time to tried this Amazing Japanese Food. High quality, high standart, fresh sashimi, best chef, nice place and nice staff. The food there was excellent and they suggested to try the most rare sake in the whole world (coz they said its just 40 bottles in the world) yeahh it’s just Pricey but soooo worthy 1 bottle for 10.000$ (i only tried for 1 bottle hahaha) and another bottles i’ve been tried 5.000$/each (i’ve got 4 bottles of this) and 2.000$/each (i’ve got 2 bottles). I drink a lot and had fun night with them (the chef’s). Overall this place it’s just to die for!! Perfect!!

It was my first visit to Shinji by Kanesaka. Have been aiming this sushiya for a while now. They are closed on Sunday, and since I always fly into Singapore on Sunday, it was impossible for me to try it, up until 2 weeks ago, when I flew into Singapore on a Saturday. My friends and I arrived half an hour ahead of our reservation time. And they were ready to serve us.We opted for "Yuki", a 15 pieces of nigiri sushi set, as I was never a big fan of sashimi. Best decision ever. I really enjoyed each nigiri sushi. Our meal started with marinated tuna with a hint of spiciness in it. It was (not overly) salty and refreshing at the same time. I liked this appetizer very much. Buri and murasaki uni was my favourite during that meal. Buri was in season and it was really good. Sawara which was topped with ponzu sauce was really good too.Overall, I had an amazing meal there. But it was very expensive for me who went there with my Ringgit Malaysia

A minimalistic surrounding with a willing mystagogy that ended to a complete bubble. It is already a challenge as far as i am concerned to discuss about a Michelin Star in a Japanese restaurant because the rating system it self was created for other cuisines and does not suit the certain one , but anyway this is a big discussion. The only reason I state that is to clear from the beginning that one of the major things that is misleading you there is that star. They only serve Omakase and with limited choices. The stuff is typical Japanese, trying to be faultless without a great success. The food is nothing special. I would not consider more than a couple of the dishes I tasted really interesting and only one at a Michelin caliber. On the contrary I have tasted some very average servings and an absolutely disappointing finale ( to laugh for ) which you can see in the pictures I uploaded. The announced “ now we will serve you dessert “ was followed by a slice of water melon , one grape and three pieces of pineapple. I don’t know if it was the super expensive grapes or melons they sale in Japan, like “ shine Muscat’s “ or likewise but even if so I don’t recognize neither the skill nor the foundation for a star on that. I can debate on the Epicurean side of the tasting and even accept it , but even if so it would have been a part of a couple of serving and not as a stand alone. The whole venue , with just an average Sake, cost me over 400 Euro which for what I enjoyed is a JOKE. I would not recommend to anybody.

Shinji by Kanesaka is every but worthy of the Kanesaka name (those of Michelin-starred dining in Tokyo).The atmosphere and service are first-rate and the quality and presentation of the food is on-par with anything you would find in Japan. I chose the Sushi-omakase set was shocked at the quality and variety offered.The service was attentive and both the chef and wait staff were great. The chef was able to communicate in English clearly and make a great sake recommendation and was able to educate me on some of the special fish they had on offer.I only had the sushi so cannot comment on the cooked dishes, but they certainly looked on-par with the sushi & sashimi offerings.Shinji is not inexpensive but is certainly worth the price if you seek high-end Tokyo-style Japanese cuisine
5
Easily the best place for omakase in Singapore. I haven't try their other location at Raffles, but this one is simply the best.
5
The quality of the seafood is absolutely amazing! I didn't realize how good it was until I have been to several other establishments. Highly recommended for good sushi and sashimi!
5
Whereas many other cuisines try to outdo each other with inventiveness and stylistic flourish, Japanese restaurants earn their stars with consistently perfect quality. Shinji is a true Edo-mae sushi restaurant, whose available omokase options will not disappoint. Every dish was spectacular, and their incredibly deep sake list offered fantastic pairings. This is a restaurant to take someone who really knows and appreciates world-class sushi; don't expect to get California rolls or sriracha-splattered sashimi here
5
I rarely give 5 stars but i must say this is one place that really wowed me. Although it is inside a hotel and the restaurant has no view and without windows, the setting was very comfortable, and has the intimacy feel to the chef.We had the omakase and there was alot of food! Started with some very tasty appetiser. Usually i never eat the pickled ginger because some places alway make it too stronge or yucky, but this was extremely well done and the taste was smooth and elegant.I love the uni sashimi with prawn and also the uni sushi. I never tasted uni this fresh and sweet before. Can tell they were extremely good quality. I like it that overall, most things are sashimi and we can taste the natural sweetness and taste of the food, the fresh wasabi was also not overpowering.I noticed that whenever the staff refill hot tea, they would change the whole teacup as well, making sure that the hot tea is not diluted with the stale tea from before. I really like that they pay attention to details.The chef was attentive and would explain the dishes when serving it. Although it was expensive, but based on the experience and. quality of food, i think it is worth it.
5
Yes. Five stars. I seldom give five stars really. This is one awesome restaurant to come back again and again in Singapore. We chose Omakase which is SGD$250 each. Every dish was excellent quality, and the sequence well thought out too. Unhurried service, impeccable standard, even if so much as drip carelessly it gets wiped off too. We never had to raise our hands to ask for tea top up. The dessert was special because this was a birthday lunch. No extra charge. Awesome. By far this is the best Japanese restaurant in Singapore and we have dined here for years.
5
menu is seasonal but always good! ingredients were very fresh and all ordered in a way that builds up the culinary experience. it is a little steep but i wouls highly recommend. given the restaurant only takes a limited number each seating ( only 1 seating), reservations are a must. dessert was awesome slices of japanese melon, grapes, and peaches. super sweet. now i know why it is so expensive in the markets. no regrets to go for the experience but be prepared to pay.

If you love sushi and love watching master chefs at work, this is the restaurant for you. The food was beautifully presented, the flavours were delicately balanced. The hushed atmosphere was peaceful after the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road. For me, the biggest treat was watching the amazing skills of the chefs as they deftly prepared course after course.We went for the mid-range dinner set. We don't have huge appetites and this was just the right amount of food for us. Highly recommended
5
Lunch - $185 Yuki course. The sushi battle continues from Shoukouwa- sushi kaishin - Shinji - sushi ichi, Hashida, Ishino and the sushi best restaurant award goes to Shinji at St Regis and it isn't close. The fish was fresh and glistening . My pictures missed out 9 other servings including needle fish , Long and shirt spiked Uni. Worth the money and hands down best consistently
2
I went to this place for the birthday of my wife and I must say that the setting (big bar around the sushi chefs) is very nice and the food is absolutely great (like the best Japanese in Japan)What was less good though was the very poor explanation behind the 3 different menus and total lack of guidance and rhythm through the menuWhat I don't understand at all is that the sushi chef was taking sake shots (at least 15 that night) with our neighbors and clearly ended up very tipsy I wrote about this to the manager but no reaction...If you pay 500 SGD per person in a 1 star restaurant you could expect some decent behavior of the staff and management which was quite disappointingOtherwise if you don't mind getting drunk, have great Japanese food and pay a lot of money, its the place to be in Singapor
5
Sushi set was amazing, with fresh fish and soft vinegar rice. We loved the subtle flavours and the texture of each bite. All their ingredients, including the green tea powder is imported from Japan. The sushi chef smiled and said that they only use the water from over here
5
We had a fantastic dinner for my daughters birthday. Food was amazing and wine surprisingly good. The chefs are incredibly talented and personable. The service is impeccable. We could not have enjoyed more.
5
Outstanding offer. Wonderful service. The sushi is fresh and well prepared. It far exceeded my expectations!
4
I have followed the chef Kikuchi-san from Raffles Hotel when they first started till now in St Regis Hotel. Six years of good sushi... but not the best place for Omakase. GO there for lunch as it is more value for money.
5
A truly authentic Japanese experience awaits you here! Treat yourself! Passion and excellent ingredients make the difference! Looking forward to my next visit (from Italy on purpose).
4
The place gets a very good rating overall in terms of ambience, food and service if you don't look at the price.If price is considered, the quality and price you paid is way way above what you can get in a nice restaurant in Japan
5
Overall experience was great. We took the middle menu set of $300 and was worth the price. Top food quality. Not sure if the $450 would be worth it though. All of my favorite Japanese ingredients were included. Very relaxed atmosphere and small intimate feeling. We would definitely return
5
I went to Shinji for lunch for a family celebration. I sat at the sushi counter and had the middle set-course. The great thing of sitting at the counter is that you get to chat with the chef. He'll tell all you want to know about the dishes he's preparing and about the fish you see orderly arranged under a glass cover.Food, needless to say, was fantastic. Most fish, according to our chef, had been flown in from Tsukiji market in Tokyo no more than two, max three days earlier. When I asked if he could get good fish in Singapore he gave me a look that said it all. However, what struck me the most, was the unobtrusive attention of the chef to our needs. I am left handed, so he started rearranging all the items on the counter so that I would not have to twist my hand to get the food. And he did it in such a natural and inconspicuous way that I only realized it when I reached out for my drink and saw it was to my left, and not to my right where the waitress had placed it. It may seem a small thing, and compared to food probably it was, but it is part of the refinement of Japan. Conversation was the icing on the cake, rather the wasabi in the sushi, and helped make the meal a most pleasant experience. Little anecdotes on how to store fish, how to cut it, and sushi in general, made me feel I had fed my mind as well as my body.All this come at a price, but it was well worth it. So, if you decide to go, enjoy the food and do not look at the bill.

Very disappointed customer. To be honest, it is a lot to spend for $450 per head, I'm expecting a spectacular dining experience.They gave lots of expensive ingredients, however, there is no balance in texture and taste. Lack of artistic culinary skills and the ambience was alright

I went to Shinji as a treat to myself after a hard yet successful week. I was also scouting out a place for a group of friends to go over the holidays to celebrate. Each year we all order the highest priced set, order champagne and sake and celebrate the year in style. So I went alone with some casual work reading just to check it out. At first, I was impressed by the full restaurant. But my impression changed when I noticed the distinct difference between my chosen set and the ones around me. Though I was sure that the people around me had ordered the same set, I received remarkably different selections of sushi, a completely different maki roll and dessert. I found out later that indeed, those sitting next to me had ordered the same set (they showed me their bill) and yet, I was given lower quality pieces and sometimes, completely different items. When I questioned the staff quietly away from the sushi counter, the response was unbelievable. Even though at first they stated I should have received certain items, when the "checked with the chef" they came back and explained it was entirely up to the chefs discretion what I was served. OMASAKE they said. Whatever! So, I received the lower priced menu and yet still had to pay for the higher price set. Perhaps this was because I was a single, caucasian female. Perhaps it was because the Asian man sitting next to me had been there before or the Asian woman were cuter than I was. Whatever the reason - BUYER BEWARE! Just because you ordered the highest quality does not mean you will get it. I lived in Japan for many years and even ordered in Japanese, yet, I was given whatever cuts they wanted to throw my way. There are other restaurants in Singapore that serve higher quality product at similar prices and don't discriminate against their customers. Ginza is a good place to start
5
This place really is as good as it gets for sushi. I went for a romantic lunch with my wife. There are essentially three options: the 12 piece set lunch for $125, the 15 piece for $180 and the full Omakase lunch for $250. We showed up very hungry, had the 15 piece lunch and left completely full and we were even struggling near the end. I say this because its easy to feel the need to upsize when in fact it isn't really necessary. I can't wait to go back
4
came here for a business lunch. the food was exquisite and felt like a very traditional Japanese sushi counter restaurant where the focus is on quality and not quantity. would definitely come back again.
5
Once agin, back to Shinji again for gathering with my friend(s). Thank you Chef Keiichi Kobayashi for preparing such wonderful lunch. Yummy and thumbs up. Best in town indeed. Thank you for arranging a special birthday surprise for my friend. I do appreciate that.
5
We er coming back. Celebrated a birthday to remember here, at everything lived up to our expectations. The chefs very entertaining and the dishes were fantastic. Highly recommended
4
You can find a very very nice sashimi and very good quality in the term of service and food. But don't expect a very BIG meal.
5
Fresh and unique sushi and sashimi! You feel as if you have been transported to Japan for the meal! A bit on the pricier side but worth it every so often as a treat!
5
I visited last Saturday and tried omakase shin. I gained 2 kg right after the meal but with no regret. :D Me and my husband are talking about the texture of their sashimi and the rice of sushi to the whole world since the night. Oh just try

My buddy celebrated my birthday by taking us to this Michelin One Star restaurant for lunch.The food was pretty good, not out-of-this-world good, but it was pretty decent. We sat at the bar and had the omakase special. Service was good.Lunch was very filling, and the bill came to slightly below $1300 for the three of us. Definitely not cheap..
5
The Sushi here is excellent. The meals served here are very similar to the other branch at Raffles Hotel. However, I think there are some slight differences; e.g. we've had caviar served as a topping, which I guess is not a very traditional sushi ingredient. This is something I've never seen at the Raffles Hotel branch. It was good regardless, so this isn't a complaint. The ambiance here is really nice too, even more so that the Raffles Hotel branch in my opinion. The lighting is dim and soft and makes for a more romantic atmosphere. Service here is excellent as well, you see the chefs at work and they are very attentive and accommodating
4
Food is fresh and well prepared. Omakase style menu means we left it up to the chef to prepare each dish and always kept us wondering what each ingredient is. Overall decent quality and good service. More traditional styled setting which is my preference having been to more trendy ones like Sokyo in Sydney (which was rubbish) and Nobu. The table counter is made of a 300 year old Japanese Cyprus tree!
5
Great 5-star service. Simple menus for lunch and dinner. I had omakase dinner SGD450++ with premium sashimi like uni, cavier and tuna cheek steak. Good Sake ranging from $35++ onwards. I had $45 and is good enough. Best place to splurge on special occasions even though sitting at counter isn't private. It's the dining experience you're getting. Top notch quality and beautiful presentation
5
Comparable to the best restaurants in Japan. Quality and freshness of the ingredients used is out of this world! The sushi chef is friendly and accommodating. Get seats at the counter and let him do his magic!
5
Had dinner at Shinji, amazing food with in-house entertainment by Japanese chef. The food is as good as you are eating in Japan. Chefs are really friendly when you are seated at the counter. Fresh handmade sushi and amazing dishes.
5
Fresh fish. Great interior. Fantastic food. My opinion is that it's not a bad option for sushi sashimi outside of Japan. A bit pricey but for me it was well worth it.
4
My first time visit. Nice food and very fresh too. Service was excellent and I will recommend this restaurant to my friend if they visit Singapore.
5
Had an interesting interpretation of sushi for dinner. We were early and took the opportunity to walk around the hotel before going into the restaurant. The restaurant staff was helpful in seating us right in front of the chef, we were the second couple to be seated. The chef's presentation was great and he tried to explained each and every serving. Great experience, overall
5
There are a few premium omakase restaurants in Singapore and they all offer pretty good service and food so its very difficult to stand out. A lot of things also depend on the chemistry with the chef. I had been to the Shinji at Raffles Hotel before and I had been disappointed because I didn't think the service, ambience and food were worth the price so it took me a while to come back. We came back to this place for a special occasion. We ordered the medium priced menu at SGD 300/pax and it was very good. The starter was very interesting and definitely worth it. Sashimi portion was disappointingly small but nice. Warm food was good. Then the sushi started coming and it was very good. Desert was fruits and simple. Ambience is very nice around a sushi bar. So hopefully you like the crowd and then the dinner can become very fun
5
One of the best Jap restaurant in Singapore. Sushi is fresh and every dish is nice. I tried the S$320 dinner set meal and its wow for me. I havent had such nice japanese sahshimi and sushi for a long time. Definitely one of the best
5
I always advice people to make reservation in advance. It is a small cosy restaurant (not many seating). I love to be seated at the sushi bar counter to look at their preparation of sushi and the adorable and funny chef. They are quite friendly.I love the sushi, each time I will order sushi set ($220/pax for dinner). It is more than enough for me, you can ask for mixture of sashimi and sushi if you are a small eater like me. I love the rice (always fresh and keep in right temperature), not too sour. The seasonal fish / seafood / vege are fresh. Quite a good range of Sake to choose. I'm certain you will like the sushi there
5
I'm gonna sing nothing but praises for Shinji. The whole experience was sublimed, from being waited on by the best Japanese trained waitress, friendly omakase chef that proudly introduces u to his sushi creations one dish or nigiri at the time, every detail being cared for to the very toothpick that is properly carved out from bamboo and most importantly, the taste of the food was extremely fresh and good. I would describe too much because sometimes, it's always good to let u discover how the little surprises you encounter. Worth every dollar
5
This resto serve omakase style. Set tasting menu according to the chef. Come here for dinner and every bite suprise me. Every sashimi, sushi all are super delicious and fresh. My chef was Mr.Keiichi Kobayashi very friendly and polite. Trully a must try restaurant with two Michellin star
5
Great fish from Japan, combined with skilled Chef produce the best sushi in town.
Wide selection of sake to complement the meal.
4
Superb quality of the fish, live preparation of each pieces by a true Japanese Sushi Master. The timing is perfect, the different flavors are well organized by the Chef.
Service is discreet and efficient.
5
I happen to have a rush dinner and need to catch my flight within one hour. Anyway, we decide to have Omakase as our dinner. So we inform the restaurant that we want to finish the Omakase dinner set within one hours.And i can assure that the dinner is very fruitful and the services is excellent. Plus the presentations is wonderful. All Japanese chef is super cheerful as well
5
Located in the exotic hotel of The Raffles, Shinji by Kanesaka is no doubt one of the best, if not the best, Japanese restaurant that one could find in Singapore.The ingredient used was fresh and exotic, while the chef demonstrated a superb level of skill and passion. Price is a bit on the high end but definitely worth every single penny of it
5
Been to the raffles hotel restaurant many times and first time here at the st Regis branch. Smaller than then raffles outlet with just a sushi counter, we readied ourselves for a good mealThere are 3 set dinner options and we opted for the middle one . There were a few good appetizers, then sashimi, and then the parade of sushi. All were very good, and the sushi were all top grade stuff like tuna belly and uni, nothing frivolous hereOverall another delightful experience here, though I think it's not as good as the michelin star restaurants in japan at the end of the da
5
Shinji has been very famous in Singapore as the best Sushi place. They newly opened at St. Regis Hotel in addition to its traditional location, Raffles Hotel. They serve Sushi with such a delicacy of superb combination of rice and fish, you must enjoy the whole experience. Chef, Mr. Kikuchi will take you through the delight of sushi tasting. In Singapore, you must try them at least once
5
Nothing to shout about regarding the decor. Service is attentive and it's expected as the customer - waitress ratio is low. However, it's the sushi that you're going for here: long spike sea urchin, short spike sea urchin, flounder, sea horse mackerel, etc on top of perfectly cooked rice. Just a little surprise that the makis were not of the same height.
5
My friend and I was quite impressed with the sushi (rice). During my first visit, we ordered a set few sushi and some cooked dish (all set comes with dessert and soup). The cooked dish was delicious but to us is nothing outstanding compare to other Japanese restaurant. But when we had the sushi, it was a little surprise, especially the sushi rice. we can taste the aroma and the taste of the sushi it was perfect. That is why 2 weeks later we went back to have dinner and this round we ordered sushi set (sushi all the way...oiishiiiiiiiii~~~). Guess what? We will be going there next week

Shinji by Kanesaka (ST.REGIS Hotel） sushi is like a jewel. It goes without saying, tasted excellent.We had a lot of sushi in Tokyo, but Shinji by Kanesaka served us the best sushi.Especially, Tuna and Uni( sea urchin eggs) tasted very good, and I love “Rolled Egg”. Chefs made us very happy. Thank you a lot of your sincere service. I would like to taste again someday when we come back to Singapore. Thank you for your brilliant service!! See you.2015 年 3 月にお邪魔しました。シンガポールに夫婦二人で訪れた際、ディナーでお邪魔しました。まさかシンガポールでこのレベルの鮨に出会えるとは思っていませんでした。銀座・築地などの数ある寿司店に行きましたが、正直ここよりすごいところはそんなにないと思います。　一言で言えば、芸術の域の寿司を提供してくれるお店です。内観は新しく、ワインセラーがあります。そこにはそうそうたる面子の日本酒がずらりと美しくセッティングされており、また木のテーブルの新しい匂いがなんとも癒されます。　こんなに天井が高く綺麗な寿司屋は、東京ではそう見かけないことでしょう。これぞシンガポールならでは。料理は前菜から黒豆のウィスキーゼリー寄せなど、美しく印象的な品々が並び、味も全て確かです。ウニ・マグロ・赤貝・シメサバなど、全て美しくかつ美味に仕上げられたもの。本物の江戸前鮨です。　一貫一貫、宝石のようにキラキラしています。板さんが焼いてくれていた玉子焼きは特筆すべき一品。これは食べたことのない玉子焼きです。ほんのり甘く、エビの香りが少しして、中がややトロリとしています。なんて不思議で美味しい玉子焼きだろうと思いました。　このレシピはきっと門外不出なのだろうなと思います。それくらい不思議な玉子焼きなのです。お酒もすすみ、かなりいただきました。「雪の茅舎」「楯野川」をいただき、どれも美味しくて何しろ刺身と寿司に合いすぎる。結構いただいきましたが、全く悪酔いしませんでした。サービスも素晴らしく、女将さんがいつも丁寧にお水がいるかなどを聞いてくれ、細やかで三歩下がったすばらしいサービスでした。シンガポールで唯一無二の寿司だと思います。幸せな気持ちになることができたレストラン。素晴らしいお寿司とサービスを、本当にありがとうございました。■スペック・時期： 2015 年 3 月・人数：夫婦二人・部屋：ディナー■レストランの雰囲気・清潔でオシャレ・リッチかつマナーの良い客しかいない・騒ぐような人がいない・ただただ寿司屋と料理を楽しむ雰囲気■個人的なおすすめメニュー（2015年3月現在）・可能であれば、全部任せたほうがいいです。苦手なものを言えばそれ以外で作ってくださいます。＜この日いただいたもので印象的なもの＞・マグロとウニのご飯・玉子焼き■サービス全体・ここぞという時に、さりげないサービスが秀逸・美しい日本の所作がまんべんなく行き渡り、それがとても楽しめる素晴らしい

My husband and I were really impressed by the quality of the seafood here. I'm currently pregnant which means I shouldn't be eating raw fish, but the food here is so fresh and after craving sushi for a long time, we decided to eat here because I have read that the seafood here is very fresh and flown in directly from Hokkaido. The presentation was of each dish was flawless and every dish was a superior version to the ones I've tried before in other restaurants. We had a set that was off menu as it was a treat from UOB, however I would say there were many overlaps with what we saw being served to the other customers. The chutoro, otoro and the uni were particularly decadent, heavenly, with special mention to the uni which was veinless and of the short-spiked urchin variety which is not commonly found. I like that japanese restaurants usually don't succumb to much pretension, and decor-wise it was very pleasing and clean. Sitting around the counter where you get your dedicated chef preparing your meal before you is always a treat, however, do not expect to make conversation in this environment without being overheard as the atmosphere is rather serious and you feel constantly watched with the wait-staff behind you and the chef watching your expression as you put each sushi into your mouth. That being said, I cannot wait to return here. Exceptional
