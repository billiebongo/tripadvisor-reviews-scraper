This Chinese style dessert place is know for Gui Ling Gao, 龟苓膏。I have tried this before it was as usual bitter, and sweet with the syrup. This time around I wanna try out sago & chestnut in egg purée, dies to the hot weather I really need to have something real chilling. Chestnuts cut in bits, very crunchy and cooling drinking it with egg puree. This will be my first choice always, usually if you don't want something too full but a bit of sweetness this is the best choice.After first bowl, I'm thinking to take risk on peanut paste. I have tried at many places, peanut paste dessert always cook by sticky, starchy, peanut powder. I believe mostly starches more than peanuts. This place surprise me, they use real peanuts, grind finely, and you can taste the real peanut paste here trust me! Love it. Will come again for both! If You want the real things, come here! $2.50 for each bowl! I overheard if you had 10 bowls of gui ling gao, they will also free one for you!
