Prompt service, friendly staff and delicious food. I had the Assam Laksa and cendol. The waitress even asked if I wanted the cendol to be served after my meal, which is not something that is usually asked.

This restaurant serves pretty delicious food at a pretty reasonable price. Love the fried rice as well as prawn mee and not to forget the grass jelly longan dessert.

Food including Curry Laksa and Chicken Satay were good. However the attitudes of their servers should be improved. Ordered water and it never came.

The restaurant wasn't even half full. We waited 15 minutes before my husband's meal arrived, and I had to remind our waiter about my meal twice. 40 mins later, I finally received my meal, which was cold, and the noodles were all stuck together. No apology or explanation why my meal was delayed for such a long time.I'll never go back!

I would like to thank all the staff for their excellent service. Food was scrumptious and piping hot. Service was efficient and would like to thank one the quite tan, tall young gentleman who provide excellent service during out dinner there. Well done and keep it up

We had our lunch a couple of times during our 3 weeks vacation in Singapore. The choice of local food is varied and includes Penang Assam Laksa, a real delicious treat from Penang. Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly and efficient.We will certainly return on our next visit to Singapor

I had a vegetarian nasi lemak with curry ($10.90) and a soy pudding ($3.50) for lunch. The place is pretty good, kind of like a fancy kopitiam with pricier, atas meals and hospitable staff. Food was decent but not spectacular and the ambience is quite cozy - ideal for a lunch date.

Tonight we had dinner in this restaurant. I had prawn mee and hubby had beef broth with noodles - including pineapple ad mint with thinly sliced beef pieces. We share a beef satay stick dish with steamed rice. All was absolutely fabulous food. The restaurant itself is very clean, the wait staff are friendly and clear the tables quickly. The novel way to place your order by selecting the number of the dish and writing it on a pad yourself, removes any chance of incorrect ordering. Not licensed, but that wasn't the end of the world. Can't wait to return

Visited Parkway Parade. Decided to have dinner at Level 1, Papparich Restaurant. A restaurant that serves local and Malaysian hawkers' delicacies.Simple clean place. Queue at peak hours expected. Ordered the Hainanese chicken rice and iced honey lemon. Average portion but tastefully good. Iced honey lemon was refreshing and quenched the thirst on a hot day. Enjoyed. Will visit again

Seriously. This is overpriced. Ok fine, you get aircon, nice seats and perhaps the queue is not that long. But for these comforts, you pay. You pay a lot more for a chicken with curry served on rice. Taste wise, well, ok it's perhaps better (more hygenic) than at a hawker centre. But hey, it's Singapore, all food is hygenic (except for the rare occurance of rats and cockroaches). All food is edible and the price is set by market demands. Unfortunately, the market here is a bit erratic. While one complaints about the bad economy, one also eats such expensive curry chicken rice alternative. Make sense
