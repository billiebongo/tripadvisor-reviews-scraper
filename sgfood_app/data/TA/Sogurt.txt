A good place to enjoy yogurt ice-cream with family and friends.
Kids love to do it by themselves.
Good service.

I visited the outlet in Kallang recently and opted for the peach yoghurt. Self service and then charged at $3 per 100 grams. Service staff weren't really that interested in their customers, just using their mobile phones the whole time but then I guess it doesn't matter when it's predominantly self serve anyway. Cash only

You have to search well to find it but the place is very nice for a lunch or just a yoghurt ice cream.Lot of healthy options like Acai, quinoa, salads etc but luckily also some IPA beers on the menu!If you are close please visit this place at least once

This is now called kara cafe. The menu shows mostly healthy food options. Which is great for our bodies. I opted for the soba salad. Portion was good enough to be eaten on its own. Added on a soup for sgd 3. The soup tasted like a tomato based... very nice! Loved it. The decor was pretty, attracted mostly the younger crowd and some families living nearb

Went to Kara (formerly known as Sogurt) for lunch today with husband and kids - my daughter's suggestion as she likes to go there for frozen yogurt with her friends, but mentioned they also do 'real' food. The 'real food' menu is a small but enticing selection of healthy salads and rice bowls, such as cold sesame soba noodles with avo, edamame, boiled egg and salad or kimchi fish tempura rice bowl (sub quinoa for rice for a $3 surcharge), all served on exquisite Japanese-style ceramic crockery. The rest of the family went for build-it-yourself Sogurt frogurt after their main course, but I was enticed (uncharacteristically as I'm not much of a dessert fan) by the description of the Charcoal Sesame Speculoos Mochi Waffle... You know how sometimes (quite often), something sounds great on paper but the reality is a bit... blah? This was not one of those times. From the charcoal black waffles topped with finely sliced fresh fruit to the speculoos crumbles and caramelly sauce, perfectly complemented by the homemade sesame snaps and sesame sticks, the whole ensemble was a perfect balance of sweet and salty deliciousness. I had mine with salted speculoos frogurt, but you could also experiment with any of the other interesting flavours on offer. Not overstating to say it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Ever. Highly recommended

This is our go-to place whenever we Want to pamper our Niece. She absolutely loves this place and so do we- the refreshing frozen yoghurt, the distinct Flavours, the multitude of toppings to choose from, the whole idea. Just very different and also highly entertaining.You can choose from 2 sizes of cups and then go on with the numerous permutations and combinations to build your own cup till it overflows The cost of the entire cup would differ from one person to the other as it entirely depends on how much your cup weighs and at times also on the number of toppings selected.From gummy bears to fresh fruits, chocolate sauces, Choco chips, marshmallows, dried fruits, candies etc- its all at your disposal. Because I am a dark chocolate lover- I am just very happy to not think twice and fill my cup with one dark Choco froyo serving. But the other Flavours were as good- they recently introduced lavender thyme, rose and other such Flavours too. Their smoothies, sandwiches and soups (the sogurt place got a new name the last time we visited-Kara) do not disappoint you either. It's a very enjoyable experience every time we are there. Keep up the good job

Sogurt offers a warm family atmosphere where you can delight in yogurt that is tasty yet low-fat. I love the idea of customizing your choices through self-service with their wide variety of different yogurt flavors and healthy toppings (I particularly love the lychee fruit). They also offer warm food if you want to make it a meal. Last but not least, your experience is made better by their friendly and energetic staff. Live, laugh, and love at Sogurt today

I prefer this outlet to the others, not that the others aren't fantastic, but this one is a little quieter at certain points of the day. Sogurt refreshes their flavours regularly and comes out with one-off flavours for special occasions. I particularly like the flavours and toppings and the price is reasonable. Highly recommend this

My estimation was wrong when i filled the cup with lychee taste yogurt..went to weigh without toppings already 8bucks..went for two toppings only the chocolate sauce and nuts add up to 9 dollars..felt the pinch...too expensive for yogurt..one must not think 3 dollars 100g is cheap..i rather the price be fixed for small medium and large cup instead like yami yogurt..the plain water that is provided free is good with a slice of lemon.however they should provide iced water for customers who are perspiring under the hot sun.honestly i will not come again...

This place charge 3$ per 100 gram. The small cup was too deep. I ended up putting on too much. The taste and texture of frozen yogurt Peach Mango was exactly same as Yami Yogurt with double the price. Yes, the ice cream was yummy but it's a little overboard on charging by gram. It isn't a Gold. Tried once and enough. Back to my yami yogurt with reasonable price for the same quality.
