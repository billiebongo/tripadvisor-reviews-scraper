Evry time I go to Singapour I go eating at entre nous, they have the best crepe in the world and the staff is really Nice
I highly recommend this restaurant
5
Don’t be deterred by the mainly grey and black decor of this small French-run creperie behind Raffles Hotel - one comes here for the food. The menu has other items but mostly the offering is crepes - both savoury and sweet. We both had the special offer - savoury and sweet crepes with a cup of genuine cider from Brittany.The crepes were well cooked and full of tasty ingredients. The dry cider was great - just as I remember from visits to France.The price reflects the quality of the ingredients and the end result. Recommended

I had this restaurant on my trip advisor wish list when I knew I was going to Singapore and glad we got to try it ! I had the buckwheat crepe with avocado and my husband had the one with cheese and mushroom. I am never able to finish a meal,( not a big eater ) and I ate the whole thing ! Service was wonderful and my husband speaks French fluently and loved conversing with the staff ! If we visit Singapore again this will be a must stop !
5
My sister and I came here for lunch on our first day in Singapore. We were seated and our orders were taken promptly by the friendly owner, and our crepes were brought out quickly. The crepes were absolutely delicious- I'm still dreaming about mine, which included three different cheeses- and we both loved the homemade salad dressing. My sister kept saying she hadn't had a crepe this good outside of France. Our only regret is not making it back here for dessert (we were too full to order a dessert crepe with our lunch, and they all looked wonderful)

I discovered this restaurant through a group on facebook, as I required restaurants which catered for coeliacs. I was pleasantly surprised to find such a wide range of choices, both savoury and sweet, with majority of options able to be made gluten free.The service here was very friendly and helpful, and I highly recommend the french onion soup and La Groix crepe as I enjoyed these so thoroughly that we returned the next day to order the same meal.I can't recommend this restaurant enough if you require a gluten free meal that actually tastes delicious
5
I recently travelled to Singapore on my own and was anxious about finding gluten free food. I saw the reviews on tripadvisor and set out to find Entre-Nous. I am so glad I did as it was so easy to locate in the road behind Raffles, I was made welcome and was pleased with the choice of food available to me. Most importantly I had confidence that the food on offer really was gluten free. I enjoyed my meal and ate there twice during my holiday
5
Thank you for a beautiful crepe last night for dinner, it was a cheesy, crispy pleasure. I am so glad I caught you on your last night before taking a break for Chinese New Year. Happy New Year and I will be back next time I am in Singapore!
5
Simple and nice decoration.The galettes were amazing, crispy and very tasty.We recommend this tiny but great restaurant
5
Had the pleasure to have a dinner at entre-nous Crêperie some time ago and the food "crêpes " or "galettes" are very good and will truly make you feel the flavors and cuisine of Brittany! Staff is very welcoming and they even have an outdoor space!
5
We recently moved to Singapore have eaten at Entre-Nous three times already! We love it. The texture of the savory crepes is wonderfully light and a bit crispy. Each crepe is carefully prepared with just the right amount of filling, not overstuffed. What first brought us to Entre-Nous is it's high rating for gluten free items (our daughter has Celiac). And now the whole family is hooked because all of the crepes are amazing. You would not know they are gluten free (really). We will be back again and again
5
The crepes are delicious ! We really have the impression to be in Brittany!! Very nice owners and team also!
5
My 2nd time there and it never fails to delight me. Texture and taste of the crepe was on point. Love everything about it, even the vibe of the place
5
I usually swing by for dessert after having dinner around the area. The caramel crepe never fails to disappoint.

First of all, I was recommended be a colleague that this was a MUST for me being francofile and loving french foods. This was supposed to be the authentic creperie. Well, having also lived in france, including where crepes are regional specialities. As I entered I heard french people speaking at the terrace, and I was positive to this lunch. Got in, found a table in front of the kitchen, that seemed "cosy" but not very clean or organised. We ordered our crepes and galettes as well as water to drink as we couldn't enjoy alcohol during a working lunch. Now we studied the menu, that had a good selection of crepes and galettes. All quite pricy to me. And having looked at the facilities, including kitchen and toilets etc, you would not expect that the prices were at this level (including for wine etc). The food got to the table, we didn't get serving at the same time either. It was not really a warm nice feeling to this place. And it felt a bit dirty to me. Then we were to pay, and they dont accept credit cards. With pricing like this, 3 of us, a lunch at more than 80-100 SGD you would expect to have a machine. I had to walk one block to find an ATM and we managed to pay for our meal. If I compare this, and people talk about their best meal ever, I'm just asking, really??? the food was OK, but you can also get french crepes elsewhere in Singapore where they also have similar set up, including with cider etc. Its NOTHING amazing about this place. I was actually more than surprised when I was experiencing this after the recommendation. Please make good use of TripAdvisor and not just give great reviews. And if you haven't been eating crepes in France and you think this is such amazing, well, save those dollars for your next vacation you can write about... there are many regular cafes in France that has more charm, more taste, cleaner and nicer service, including accepting credit cards... Je suis resolee (I'm sorry!
5
Good selection of crepes, everyone seems to enjoy it. First time there, enjoyed the set, pretty good value and filling at $33. Overall savoury crepes are nice, a tad expensive for this kind of food, but reasonable considering the downtown location and the quality ingredients (excellent ham).Salad and dessert crepe are nothing interesting. Nice lady boss with earnest attitude, asked if I enjoyed it at the end of the meal
5
Very lovely owner, the ambience was nice and it was quite well-located. Food was good, try the quiche and crêpe!
5
We had a wonderful set-menu with crepes. The owner was incredibly friendly and the service was perfect
5
Chance upon this while looking for a new brunch place. Best decision ever ! It is a small place but very cozy, staff were attentive and crepes are delicious. Coming back here twice in less than 4 days just shows how good they are. Definitely recommend this place :

Chance upon this crepe shop as we were looking for tea. My good memory of Cannes where I got my breakfast crepe came alive. Surprise! I was thinking she’s like a beautiful homemaker trying to make that crepe for us and there’s no one in the shop. Finally the crepes presented to us, well, more than homely, it was done with skills n know how of a real French crepe. It comes not cheap but where else can you find it in spore that’s like this. I tried other places eg Boat Quay n others but this entre nous creperie is the crown
4
Went there a couple of times with friends, good moment.A bit hidden but once you go through the door, you are in Britanny, France!Good choices of crepe and side dishes, AND bread with butter Traditional, I recommend.Source: I'm French, with 28 years of crepes eating experience
5
Nice. It was an amazing experience to try their best food. Not sure if i was just too hungry that time that was why it was too delicious. Or maybe not because i was hungry. But all in all ok.
4
The crepes are well made and tasty. However, the prices of the crepes would really prevent you from going back for more. 20sgd for crepes that are sprinkled with some meat or egg or tomatoes just don’t justify the high price tag. Sorry ..
5
So very taste and usual food, big variety of tastes, friendly staff. Strongly recommend to visit and try!
5
I had been missing the great gluten free crepes we had in France and had heard about this place, and chanced upon it when I was trying to escape from the rain. Great, authentic savoury galettes and sweet crepes on offer, with gluten free options, vegetarian and vegan options all clearly marked and very knowledgeable staff. Lovely service, and I hope to be back again soon
5
The buckwheat crêpes are fantastic with lots of flavour. Lots of savory and sweet options to choose from. They also have good gluten free options. The service is warm and welcoming. Always happy to come back
4
What they lack in size and decor, they more than make up in service and taste. If you like crepes, it's a must visit place. Very kind and friendly people.Just couple of areas that can be improved upon, work towards a cashless payment option and cleanliness could be further improved. We found a small hair in one of our crepes. Overall recommended for crepes lovers
5
Entre Nous Creperie is a lovely example of Brittany's regional specialties - galettes made with buckwheat flour, a savoury version of the classic crepe. They also do crepes for dessert. We tried their savoury galette La Ouessant with ham, cheese, mushrooms and an egg. Delicious! And a reminder of north western France.Do order a bottle of the French apple cider. Our favourite is the brut which is crisp and dry.If you have a gluten intolerance or allergy (eg coeliac disease) this is the place where you can eat without concern for gastric repercussions. Tell them when you order your meal and you won't be disappointed. They also do delicious duck rillettes as a starter. And the prices are very reasonable for Singapore
5
After 12 years in Singapore, I finally made it! And I don't regret it.Authentic crispy crepes full of tastes. My local guests were enthusiastic.If you don't know crepes, go for it. You will love it.Thanks again to the very friendly staff
4
It's my second time here and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Delicious Le Ouessant and Apple crepes. Crispy crepes with quality ingredients. Nothing's too savory or to sweet; it has the right balance. For those who prefer the gluten free variety, they are surprisingly equally good! The french onion soup is flavorful despite being vegetarian is a big plus for me as most usually the deep flavour has been derived from beef stock, which is not the case here. All in all, a great date venue or brunch option with girlfriends who want a break from the typical brunch menu or pancakes
5
Best place for crepes in SG! Crispy, flavourful and sublime with an accompanying dry cider. So note that this place is cash only and a Premium savoury crepe and a cup of cider will be around $30~$35
5
A lovely place with authentic french crepes .nice service and lovely and friendly waiters .Worth it.
4
If you love crepes, this is the place to come. A full range of sweet and savoury crepes to satisfy any crepe craving.Quality is excellent and there is an interesting drink menu to pair with the crepes. Only down side is we found the prices for a crepe bit high and they don't accept credit cards.
5
Cozy nice friendly bistro tucked just right next to the Mint Museum of Toys.Absolutely a BIG treat for those folks who are on special diet as the restaurant has gluten-free crepes prepared in buckwheat flour (with lots of toppings to choose!)Better still, for those who are on diary-intolerant diet, Geraldine, the friendly owner had the crepe done for my Daughter (on the special diet) with no butter added to her crepe. It was so mouthwatering that my Daughter gorged 2 of the (egg with tomatoes) crepes at one-go!! Thanks for making our this year’s Christmas one of the most memorable - especially, to see my Daughter enjoying a hearty meal with us!*A must try is ‘Geraldine’s favourite’ crepe!
5
We came here for a late lunch and had savoury galettes first and a sweet crêpe for dessert. They were both absolutely yummy and tasted just like the ones you will be served in Brittany! I can see that some people will find the place rather expensive. I agree but at the same time you can see and taste that these guys use premium quality products so I guess the price is fairly reasonable in the end. Service was lovely so I will definitely come back
5
This restaurant was a real find and treat in the middle of Singapore. The food was delicious and authentic. I recommend the dry cider and caramel crepes. The owner was attentive and so kind. We cannot thank her enough for going the extra mile to make us feel welcome.
5
We were around the corner after a gallery opening at Raffles Hotel and we wanted something light and tasty. This fits the bill! The portions are smaller than most restaurants but if you're looking for something light (as we were), this is perfect
5
I had just arrived in Singapore that afternoon, and unfortunately had to make an unscheduled visit to the Raffles Hospital. Having some time to kill before we went back to the hospital for the test results, and it being dinner time, my adult daughter and I decided to look for this restaurant which I have been keen to try.It was a rainy night, but we found it down a side street close to the hospital, and upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by Geraldine and seated inside. There was only one other table occupied and that was outside. It seems it was a slow night due to the rain.As we weren't very hungry we decided to share an avocado and roast chicken crepe and a Geraldine's Favourite (a crepe with apple, salted caramel sauce, and vanilla ice cream).Both were delicious, and we were glad that we had decided to share, because although they were light and crisp, they were quite rich and filling.Service was excellent and it was a delight to chat to Geraldine. I'll definitely return the next time I visit Singapore
5
Amazing gluten free crepes!! We had both a savoury and dessert and both were so good! Only wish we could've fit more in :) very friendly and helpful staff, do bring cash though as they don't have card facilities - an atm is close by in the mall. Will definitely be returning here and w9uld recommend it to anyone :
5
I used to travel to Fontainebleau for work and my colleagues would bring me to this creperie that made awesome crepes and delicious cider (in a tea cup)When I left the company and stopped traveling to Fontainebleau, I thought I would never taste such awesome goodness. Then I chanced upon Entre-Nous while running errands with my toddler. One bite of their crepe and a sip of their cider (also in a tea cup!) brought me back to Fontainebleau...I love the avacado prawn crepe while my son loves the ham and Emmental + egg crepe (he's 2.5 and he polishes off half of the entire portion) and we both love the salted caramel crepe. Now Entre-Nous is my go to place when I run errands. Geraldine and Stefan run a really tight ship. I love going there cos the food is good but also it feels like my neighbourhood cafe where they know my son and my son always asks after auntie geraldine and uncle Stefan. Highly recommended!(And I know my crepes... they are by far one of the best I've had in singapore!
4
Chances upon this restaurant and did not think much about what it could offer but definitely did not disappoint. Lovely French food in a cozy and clean environment. Savoury crepes and sweet crepes are available. Gluten free options available too. The emmental cheese, egg and ham crepe was simply delicious. Stephan’s favourite for both savory and sweet crepes were also yummy. Must tr
4
It was one of my joyous dinner trip from a satisfying meal and a superb, efficient, friendly service! Besides their savoury crepes, try their Roasted chicken. Will definitely recommend anyone who has a love for true authentic crepes.
4
Pre theatre dinner at 6pm on a Friday evening. Made reservations with a very pleasant French lady. 6 adults shared 5 savoury crepes and 3 sweet. Wine and cider went very well with our dinner. The roast chicken in one of the savoury crepes was a little dry. The others were very good
4
The food is good and authentic. Although serving may look small but it was filling enough for me with just a soup and buckwheat flour galette
5
We were planning on catching our walking tour nearby but needed some fuel to keep going. My daughter found this place. I was a bit hesitant because in my mind, crepes are this thin dough with Nutella and some sort of fruit, like banana or strawberries. We ordered the chef’s recommendations: one sweet, which was Geraldine’s favorite - homemade salt butter caramel with apples and ice cream and one from their les gastronomiques menu which was the entre - nous - mashed avocado with prawn and tomatoes. Both with deliciously satisfying! I filled my hungry stomach after 17hrs of eating airline food! I was really pleasantly surprised! I wish I can go back and try the rest
4
Stumbled across this little gem, right near our hotel, by chance. The food was delicious, very authentic and the hosts delightful. We had been enjoying all the lovely Asian food in Singapore, but this was an unexpected find. It is cash only.
5
Ate twice at this restaurant at beginning of November whilst in Singapore for a few days. The owners were very welcoming and knowledgeable about the food. The buckwheat gluten free crepes were fantastic and very filling. Definitely will be visiting Enter-Nous again when back in Singapore
4
This is about a 5 minute walk from the Raffles Hotel! It's quaint, but chic. The staff is nice and you will not wait long for your food. They are playing nice French music and there are interesting photos of different places in France as the decoration. Look up and you will see that even the pipes are painted in the French flag colors. They have a nice selection of spirits. Try the dry cider, it's wonderful. I had the French Onion soup because I wasn't very hungry, but I also tried a portion of my husbands savory crepe and we shared the Carmel crepe for dessert. Nothing that we ordered disappointed. They only take cash, so come prepared. You can get a decent meal for about S$45-50 It's a great little find. If you found this review helpful, please give me a helpful rating. Thank you and enjoy
5
Believe the reports these crepes are awesome. Had the French Onion soup and a crepe. Both were very authentic and lovely. Sure it’s a little more expensive that the local food but hey you just saved yourself a flight to France. Will definitely be back.
5
This is a lovely owner operated French creperie. You will not be disappointed. The owner is very kind and knowledgeable. The cafe has a wonderful atmosphere. We were satisfied both with the savory and dessert crepes. I would absolutely go back
5
Delicious food served by super friendly and welcoming staff. Front of house Geraldine had fantastic knowledge about what coeliacs needed and kept us advised over several visits. Of course all the food looked fabulous as well. Even though we hardly had any room the GF deserts were a treat and the cider from Brittany - Oh la la
5
My husband and I have been going to Entre-Nous for at least the past five years. We love the duck rillette and I always have the ham, egg and mushroom crepe, followed by the salted caramel crepe. Yes, you too will have space in your tummy for all that yummy
5
In my opinion, you will be hard-pressed to find better crepes in Singapore and the ingredients used are definitely quality.The place is surprisingly homely for a place in the middle of the city and the service is just as warm yet not imposing.Take note this place only accepts cash so bring enough before heading over. Its midway between Bugis and City Hall MRT Station, where you will be able to find some ATM. Bring about SGD50 per person; That should be enough to get you a main, a drink, and a dessert.Despite the price, I enjoy coming here when I want something different and satisfying, but not too heavy
5
It's a really great place, with very friendly hostess and amazing crepes.Everything is perfect - I'll definitely come back to this place, when I visit Singapore again
5
My first trip down to entre -nous .Wonderful experience with the warm service from Geraldine .Food was really really great esp the house special crepes and salted caramel crepes .Will return soon for sure PS-cash accepted only (just take note )
5
Love this place after my first try dew months ago. Have been bringing family and friends back, even vegetarian would have some options if want to dine there, The food is not cheap but it is really tasty. Though the potion might give you a fright when it is served, it is so light that you can finish it easily. The price of the drink, however, is a bit on the high side
5
Had a lazy morning and caught this place as it just opened so had a crÃªpe for brunch. Glad we did! Brilliant food and friendly service. With the prices being so inexpensive compared to other top places on TripAdvisor I can't see how this place isn't #1
5
Had a great dinner at Entre Nous. Discovered this place thru TripAdvisor and it was a real pleasure to eat tasty buckwheat flour crepes. Choice between 1 menu and A-la-carte. Imported French cider also available. Definitely a place I will go back
5
invited my parents, with wife and kid at Entre Nous and dinner has been a real pleasure.It was a great surprise to eat crepes tasting as what we can have in Brittany, which is where crepes comes from. A good choice of (real) buckwheat flour galettes in a cosy place, with friendly and professional staff. Cider imported from Brittany is also available, which make this place to be like a piece of Brittany in Singapore
4
Very nice savoury and sweet crepes, try both on buckwheat for healthy options. Good service. Bit pricey but overall recommended
4
I chose this restaurant, off Tripadvisor, whilst still in New Zealand, for my birthday dinner with family. The five of us all had different savory crepes. For dessert three chose Creme Brulee and two of us the dessert crepes.We all thoroughly enjoyed our meal, Geraldine, who looked after us, was attentive but unobtrusive and I promised her I would write a review. Hope you see this Geraldine
5
Very lovely crepes! Tried both the savoury and sweet, savoury wins. Will return to try other items on menu. Service is polite and non-intrusive. Note though they do not accept cc payment.
5
If you want to enjoy a French evening with authentic galettes, savory crepes and cider, come to Entre-Nous! Do not miss the salted-caramel crepe, it is a must 😋! Best of all, kind, warm and caring owners!
5
Cute little restaurant where the owner welcomes you herself. Good choice of menu and quality/price ratio. We recommend :)
3
The crepes tasted pretty good - fresh and healthy but they were pricey for what you get and not very filling at all. Hubs and I got a starter and a crepe each - bill came up close to 90 bucks and we needed to get a second dinner which is a bit extreme. Better for a snack than a meal in my opinion
5
Stellar caramelised onions. They nailed it well. Got to be the best French Onion soup in Singapore! Have an Apple Cider. It’s served in the traditional cup and it helps with cleansing your palate in preparation for next course.
5
Entre-Nous Creperie possibly took me on a gastronomical adventure to France and back. I am pretty embarrassed with myself , only to know this lovely French resturant in the heart of Singapore only recently (They have been here nine years!) . Owned and managed by a lovely French couple serving everything authentic French crepes. Oh the Cream Mushroom and Seafood (Day special). The crepes savory or sweet crepes are just done perfectly. Also Salted butter caramel sauce crepe for dessert is on point!
5
My husband and I have just returned from a long weekend in Singapore. I am gluten intolerant so finding somewhere good to eat can often be tricky. In advance of our arrival I asked our hotel for some suggestions of places where I would be able to eat safely. We tried Entre-Nous on our second day in the city. We were greeted and served by the owner and enjoyed a lovely conversation with her about Bretagne as well as Singapore itself. The food was delicious - both savoury and sweet crepes available using gluten free buckwheat batter - and they were absolutely delicious. So good we went back the next day as well! The restaurant also serves locally (Bretagne) sourced cider which was also delicious and a great accompaniment to wash the crepe down.I would highly recommend this place to anyone but especially to the coeliacs out there!! As and when we return to Singapore we will definitely be revisiting Entre-Nous. Thank you for two delicious meals!
5
We did not try this wonderful place until the day we had to leave. We were a diverse picky bunch and I have a wheat/gluten allergy. But we were absolutely over the moon to find this fabulous friendly eatery not far from our hotel. The buckwheat crepes were delicious, the lady who’s restaurant it is is lovely, friendly, informative and deserves a big thumbs up for her little fab little place. We would have made several visits had we found it before. But on our return to Singapore it will be our 1st port of call. You made our last day more bearable thank you so much. A must try for everyone.
5
Hands down the best crêpes in Singapore. I have been to Entre-Nous many times and it's always a treat. Any savory crêpe with avocado is always good. Their rillettes is delicious too. Must try dessert crêpes with home-made salted butter caramel sauce--it is incredible. I always have it with whipped cream
4
Visited here on the back of some good reviews as we were looking for some GF options (and to practice my schoolboy French!). Crepes are a particular favourite of mine and to have them made to a GF recipe was great. We only had the savoury ones - no real room for the sweeter ones - and some lovely Breton cider to accompany. Geraldine, the owner, was a breath of fresh air, charming and helpful.One small note - we were not aware until time to pay - they do not accept cards (we didn't ask why) but cash only. Luckily we had sufficient cash so as not to have to do the washing up to pay for our supper but it is worth remembering. Tucked away in a small street off Beach Road but not difficult to find. Give it a go - you won't be disappointed.
5
Fantastic restaurant, with genuinely lovely hosts. The la ouessant crepe is a must-try! We'll be back for sure.
5
Friendly service and best crepe i ever had! Location is very central and easy to get to.. definitely will return and hangout!
5
Once again, we have had a great evening at Entre-Nous. My parents are on holidays for a month and it was so nice for them to enjoy this French treat... Crepes as nice as back home! And I can actually have gluten-free crepes, just as tasty. I personally recommend the 3-cheese crepe, my father loved the classic one with mushroom, ham and cheese, and oh my... the salted caramel ones for dessert... Taste everything, it is delicious :-
5
It was absolutely great experience. The owner was very attentive, very sociable(not to much) and most important we had Gluten free crepes and a desert of the day. Is not easy to find in SG gluten free cafes and restaurants. So it was absolutely satisfactory BD celebration! Merci Geraldine
5
My partner and I went there to celebrate our anniversary day. We ordered 2 savoury crepe and 2 soups. I had a hard time deciding if I prefer the tomato soup or the onion soup, but I decided that I like both. The crepe was amazing as described in other reviewers. We were treated with much attention even when the crowd starting to come in after awhile. Gona bring my mom over the next time to try the sweet crepe ;
5
The crepes are superbly delicious, their salted caramel sauce is mouthwatering! (I wish I had purchased some to take with me)... we were looked after like guests rather than customers, and will definitely return
5
the place is run by a european couple and has a very authentic homely feel to it. the owner attends to you personally and very humble and polite.the food was really nice slightly expensive but good. would definately recommend the sweet crepes here
5
I discovered Entr-nous when I was working around the area and have since introduced the place to many friends. We went there so often that my friends and I now just say let's meet at our crepe place and we know exactly what to expect - excellent food and warm service and welcome. Going back is always a great experience
5
Wonderful little bit of French cuisine in Singapore. They make traditionals crepes so do not expect pancakes! They are thin and delicious, sweet or salted with quite a nice selection! Its a family restaurant run by a young couple who are always warm and inviting. highly recommend a visit for those wanting to experience something different in Singapore
5
A great place to eat authentic French crepes with good cider drinks. And being French I know what I am talking about : ) The owners are very nice and you feel very welcomed! The colors and decoration of the place really re-create the Brittany atmosphere.I went there for lunch for the first time and I saw that many people were regulars.The menu offers a lot of different crepes and you can have salad too if you feel like it. I am gluten intolerant and there was a lot of options for me. There was even a delicious almond flour cake and it is not often that you can eat cakes in a restaurant when you are gluten intolerant!I will definitely come back there. It's a very convenient place either for a quick lunch if you are working because the service is very efficient or to bring some friends and family (kids would love it) at week ends.Every city needs a good creperie and this is the one
4
My family love the buckwheat crepes and apple cider. Lovely restaurant. They only accept cash though !
5
After a day at Versailles, we enjoyed the delicious crepes ! Wide choices of both savory and sweet fillings. Coffee was also aromatic and strong
5
Probably the best Crêperie in Singapore, everything is really good and freshly cooked. Very good Apple Cider.
The owner is very warmful.
I highly recommend this restaurant.
4
First time at Entre-Nous - I'd recomended and it is a wonderful experience. The restuarant is relaxed and at a convenient location along Seah Street.  The Handmade (Gluten Free) Crepes and ingredients are done with pride and are delicious. We enjoyed ourselves there with the thoughtful service from the owner. Definitely recommend the 3 cheese Crepe and to make it more fancy, do add on an egg. After savory crepes we also had the sweet crepes - one thing to note is that ingredients are handmade and I especially enjoyed their vanilla ice cream
1
We always look for crepe everywhere we went. This one is rated very high, but were we disappointed. The crepes are too thin and dry. We sort of feel like eating thin wafer that is also chewy. The bill came to more than $60, for one shrimp crepe with a few small drops of shrimp, and a combination basic ham+swiss cheese crepe and a salted butter desert crepe with one small cup of cider. Service is just order, serve and bill. Cash only
5
Based KL this is always on my must visit list in Singapore. Even if there is not time I always take a later flight to ensure I can eat here. The husband and wife business is always friendly and they go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and comfortable. It is like you have walked into their home. The food is fantastic and even after multiple visits the same high standard is always upheld. Will be back again - on the next trip to Singapore! Thank you for an absolutely fantastic meal!
4
Place owned by a lovely French couple. We've been here for years and we've seen their children grow up! Good true French crepe - both savoury and sweet, delicious apple cider (le cidre), they carry both sweet (doux) and dry (brut). Many good feedback here are true
5
My wife and I discovered this creperie only recently, though it's been here longer than our 7 years in Singapore. It's now a favourite of ours. The savoury galettes and sweet crepes are just fantastic, made with organic ingredients imported from Brittany to keep them traditional, served with brilliant French 'craft' ciders (including an organic cider) in traditional cups. The crepes are just far superior to those in other creperies in Singapore, which are already quite good. The owners are very welcoming and friendly, lovely people, and the casual atmosphere is great. We've held a birthday party there and introduced the place to a number of friends, all of whom loved it. Price-wise it's good value, just note that you can't pay by car
5
Crepes are just fantastic! Traditional French Brittany black wheat gallettes and crepes. Ingredients are truly homemade (crepes, bechamel, whip cream, sorbet and ice creams, caramel..) and you can feel it! Owners and staffs are very nice and efficient and prices reasonable.Try it you you will not be disappointed!!Michiko & Jeremi

Went around 7 pm and we took a table for 4 inside, no other customers queuing outside for a table. We were served quickly and since we already had dinner, we only ordered 2 dessert crepes and no drinks.Lady owner was noticeably upset with this and said “Now it’s dinner service and we are busy and is that all?” We were flabbergasted because there wasn’t a queue outside and we certainly did not deny anyone a seat inside. There was also no comment that there is a minimum spend during dinner or ordering 2 dessert crepes for 4 persons is not acceptable during dinner time. We wanted to cancel the order but since they already started we decided to stay on.The coconut and butter cream was delicious. The chocolate and banana was pretty good. Service was fast and we were out within 15 mins as we also had a play to catch. We spent S$34. I think it would be better to be more upfront in the expectations and minimum spend during dinner time or just say we can’t just order desserts during that time. The entire experience was rather unfortunate and frankly rude.
5
Great food and excellent service - a really enjoyable experience. Certainly wouldn't be disappointed.
5
I took the milk with home Caramel better it was excellent and also the crepes!! I love it so much it was so gentle and good tasted. In the end I also bought the caramel to take home
5
Tucked away in Seah Street, just behind Raffles, is this wonderful creperie. We thoroughly enjoyed our crepes with apples and salted butter caramel - yummy! The owner is charming too

Hello everyone, I am a 34 French (from Bretagne) woman living in Singapore for more than 7 years now and I wanted to share with you that, coming from the true Bretagne region in France, this creperie is the only true French creperie which offers the real deal in terms of Galettes (buckwheat, gluten free) and Crêpes... I have been looking all around Singapore and this is definitely the best crêperie ever here ! I highly recommend their Galette d'Arz and their crêpe with salted caramel. the dough is not too thick and not too thin, divinely crispy, the ingredients are genuine and of good quality, and finally the recipes are the real ones you would fine in Bretagne. The owners are super nice and down to earth. Having some diet restrictions, they always accomodate me with a big smile! Anyway, all this to say that I highly recommend you this place for a lunch or dinner around the Raffles Hotel area
5
I'm a bit of a crepe fan and have travelled around looking for the best in Singapore... But I keep coming back to Entre-Nous! Perfect crepes every single time!!! Their dry cider is a perfect pairing... And OH MY GOODNESS, their salted butter caramel crepe is the stuff my sweet dreams are made of!!!I forgot to take photos this time round, but at the rate I keep coming back to this little slice of French heaven in Singapore, I know I have many opportunities to update my review with pics
5
Delicious meal for the whole family. We all enjoyed our buckwheat crepes for mains and desserts! My son was introduced to escargot and loved the dish! The Brittany apple cider was scrumptious. We look forward to returning soon to try out more of the menu
5
Delicious! We had homemade authentic onion soup and crepes .. will certainly come back here for Sunday lunch!
5
I booked a table for my birthday lunch I had never been before but it was definitely the right choice. The place is quaint, understated and, friendly, it reminded me so much of the creperies I have visited in France. The crepes were delicious I had the savoury Entre-nous (avocado, prawns and tomatoes) and a glass of Bordeaux - heaven. We shared a dessert as we were quite full which was presented with a birthday candle; it's the little things that speak volumes about the care that is taken to make customers feel welcome but Geraldine's food speaks for itself. This is going to be a regular place for me. Merci beaucoup à bientôt
5
This was the fourth time we have had the pleasure of dining at the Entre-Nous Creperie and it was again superb. Excellent food, service and ambience means this is a restaurant that won't disappoint. Especially happy with the gluten-free aspect as one of our party is following a gluten free diet and the options were plentiful and delicious - the staff are also very knowledgeable about the food and menu!Bon appetit
5
Regular of entre nous, as the crepes are always the best, and the service welcoming as usual with Geraldine and Stephane.If you want the best crepe in singapore then no more doubt to have, just head to entre nousPs: i am french so i know my crepes
4
A great afternoon party and delicious crepes. Cosy environment, suitable for friends and family. Various types of crepes to choose from.
5
best & nicest crepe in town. especially the salted caramel crepe. i love it everytime i come will definitely go for this one.
5
We went for a pre birthday treat for my daughter. Proper French crepes, the kids had theirs with homemade ice cream my husband is a cheese lover so had "Geraldine's favourite". It is now his favourite too! We shared some escargot for the kids to try and they loved it. Everything arrived hot and freshly made from the kitchen. Service was professional, welcoming and attentive. Located next door to Mint Toy Museum
5
Yes I follow TripAdvisor high rating to this restaurant. Yes the French owner she super sweet and nice. Yes the crepe was so good we ordered more ... yes truly authentic and exceed my expectation! IDon't think twice! Just go try it out! Menu no.11 was Damn gooooooood!!!!!!!
4
We went here reluctantly for dinner, it was a very good meal. Enjoyed the crepes very much, and loved the Escargot to start with! If you are in the mood for something different this restaurant is a great start! Its on the 'moderate' side for costs, but its not bad. Not many deals in Singapore when it comes to food
3
Went there with family for late lunch. Cosy nice place. Service was good, very hospitable but serving the crepes took quite some time that afternoon - about 30 mins I reckon. Taste wise was ok, but would not rate it as high as others did for this restaurant
5
I loved both the soup and the desert that I ate here. The creme brûlée was Fantastic!! I took the homemade soup of the day and it was very delicious too. they had some good wine too. The waitress was very pleasant and ambience was warm and cosy.
5
Such a delight to taste perfectly crispy buckwheat crêpes, with delicious choice of filling assortment. Great choice of ciders, beers & organic apple juice, all from Bretagne ! Fantastically tasty home made lemon sorbet to finish. Really great time with family & very warmful owner
5
Thank god for this piece of Brittany in the middle of Singapore! Their galettes are the greatest i've had in the city - they are exactly like what they should be like. My favorite is Le Ouessant. You guys should try it!The staff is very friendly and helpful. I strongly recommend it.
5
came across this place on tripadvisor and read the reviews which were excellent. decided to check it out and dropped by on a Friday evening. it was a good decision. the restaurant is located along seah street, easily accessible by mrt (bugis and city hall). there is al fresco sitting as well. the service is good. the menu is extensive for crepes. it was a hard choice to make but the owner made good recommendations. I will certainly return to try more of the items. totally yummy
5
We go to Entre Nous quite often, and we always have a good time. The crepes are delicious, nicely presented on the plate, and the service is excellent. We highly recommend the place!!
4
This was a really cozy place that served amazing crepes. I think it was price worthy and I would go back if I was in the mood for crepes!
5
We had fun celebrating a friend's birthday at Entre-Nous. The place was nice and cozy, food amazing and the service lovely. Geraldine was sweet and helped us in surprising our friend with a little birthday cake. Try the salted caramel crepe - it's to die for
5
Entre-Nous is an easy level walk from the CBD / Marina Bay. It is a small, cosy and very welcoming place serving affordable and utterly delicious crepes. They have gluten free options for savoury and sweet, cider, lemon ice tea, house wine and coffees. They only take cash and 2 crepes, a drink and a coffee comes to around SGD 40 / GBP 23 or USD 29. Excellent value.I love this place, I have been at least 8 times across my business trips and will go many more times. The team are friendly, the chef excellent and the crepes taste wonderful, as goods as any place in mainland France. Go and enjoy. :
5
Came here for dinner with a friend. Had the following crepes "Geraldine's Favourite", "La Batz" and the "Entre-nous" dessert crepe.Geraldine's Favourite - what a delightful mouth-feel and taste experience! First you have the crispy crepe with its intriguing texture, then your taste buds are entertained by the melted cheeses and finally their happy frolic in your mouth leaves you wanting more. Do note that one should have a taste for different cheeses before ordering this lovely dish. 8.5/10La Batz - soft crepe meets the ocean. Another dish that didn't disappoint. Great balance of smoked salmon and creamed spinach though a larger portion of creamed spinach wound not hurt. 8/10Entre-nous - dessert crepe. Wow. Just wow. The salted butter caramel was perfect. Right balance of sweet and savoury. The crepe was the ideal vehicle for this libation to the gods. You could almost taste the hints of ocean-kissed Brittany secreted in the butter. Not to be missed. 9/10Hot chocolate was ordinary though I feel more could be done; being that all the best interpretations of "chocolat chaud" we've experienced in France and in french establishments have never disappointed.Service was excellent. Atmosphere is simple
5
My girlfriend and I visited Entre-Nous on the 19th of August. The service was great and the food was even better. The interiors have a sea-side/sailor vibe which was very refreshing. This was our first time there, and it's not going to be our last. Very easily the best crepes in Singapore
5
We found a Singapore gem in Entre-Nous creperie. It is in a handy location adjacent to Raffles, providing a broad selection of buckwheat crepes, savoury and sweet, as well as an assortment of drinks to accompany.We had wonderful friendly service, with no sense to hurry our meal as we chatted with the waitress.They cater well for gluten free, one of our requirements
5
Finally found time to dine at Entre-Nous and it was definitely worth it. I ordered the escargots, "Geraldine's favourite" crepe of homemade salted butter caramel, cooked apples and homemade vanilla ice-cream and was so engrossed in the food that I did not notice what my husband ordered (think he ordered a grated coconut crepe). Restaurant was cosy and service was excellent. Thank you Geraldine and Stephan for the superb food. Will be back for sure
5
This was a true experience. Two months later there are two strong memories of our visit. The mushroom soup was so rich and creamy, unlike any soup I've had before. The Apple cider from the local French region of the Restaraunt owner was amazing. Textural and full of mouthfeel, we had to order a second bottle
5
The crepes are really really thin, healthy (made from buckwheat) and delicious. Discovered this hidden gem accidentally, and will be certain to go back.
5
Both the sweet and salty crepes are good.Especially the salted caramel sauce and salted caramel milk!
5
An absolutely perfect way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon! The crepes are outstanding; I had the avocado and chicken (which is even imported from France) and it was delicious. Geraldine's friendly yet super-efficient service is also outstanding, so it is no surprise that the restaurant was full to capacity. We had a lovely time and will be back for sure
4
I always think that a good gauge of a food establishment serving cuisine from a particular place is whether it attracts the locals from its country of origin. At entre-nous, this is so, and this cosy space attracted couples, families... people of all ages. We were a table for two, and had both of Geraldine's sweet and savoury favourites, and an order of escargot. Escargot was cooked just right- not the tough, chewy ones that sometimes get served in other restaurants. We couldn't help but mop up the leftover juices and marinade with the bread provided. The savoury crepe was delish. Crepe was paper thin, with bits of crispiness and that slight bit of char-ness that I can best describe using the Chinese word of "wokhei", which is the complex charred aroma from the wok, and is a measure of a good stir-fry. We enjoyed the contrasting sweet, soft and cold flavour and texture the sweet crepe was to the savoury. We left nothing on the plate. After which, we sat back, sipped our cider, and enjoyed hearing the french language that filled the air in that space. We enjoyed our afternoon at entre-nous - food was delicious, space was cosy, and we were impressed with the efficiency and attentiveness given by Geraldine and her small team. We will be back. ;-
5
Entre-Nous creperie is fantastic! We were there over Easter this year and I just came across their business card so I can write a review! :) I really thought I had lost it but I am glad I can write this review now! We were staying at the Naoumi hotel only a few doors down from it and we discovered this little french gem! The galettes are amazing and they are gluten free made with buckwheat but I am very grateful that Geraldine was so accommodating with my dietary requirements -and made them dairy free too, they were delicious! We went back several times for lunch and for breakfast as well! Thank you Geraldine, I am still dreaming of your galettes and cant wait to come back and see you! :)Thank you for the salted butter caramel sauce that you make - my husband has polished it off, he loved it!Entre-Nous creperie reminded me of Paris - the beautiful galettes, salad and service! Geraldine is so lovely and warm and welcoming - it was truly wonderful! :)If you are stuck in Singapore and you are gluten and dairy free - Geraldine will look after you. RegardsDian
5
A very high standard of cooking by the French chef. I had the avocado and prawns crepe and it was really delicious. The couple from Bretagne run this cosy little restaurant.They only accept cash, so be prepared. Walls are decorated with posters of lighthouses which are part of the scenery in Bretagne
5
Have been there twice during our stay inSingapore. Food is excellent it is hard to decide what to get. Friendly staff. Well worth going to
4
Visited here twice with friends. It's quietly tucked at a little shop, rarely crowded. Love the crepes a lot, although pricey for the serving served. However, still worth a visit if you have any crepes craving. I would certainly come back again.
5
Great service and the best crÃªpe we ever had! Would definetly recommend this place for breakfast/lunch or both like we did :
5
On A Recent Visit To Singapore-08/07/17 My Wife Was Searching For a Place Which Had A Breakfast Menu Which Had GF Options Available As I Have Coeliac Disease .This Charming Place Came Up On Her Search So We Decided To Try Something Different To The Usual Culinary Fare Available In Singapore. We Were Greeted At The Door By The Friendly Hosts-A Husband And WifeTeam Who Had Originally Relocated From France To Start a Business Venture In Singapore.The Menu Was Full Of GF Options From The Sweet And Savoury Crepes To Quiches Etc. The Food - A GF Crepe For Me And Quiche For My Wife Were Lovely And Delicious, Good Portions On Both. The Lovely Wife Was The Perfect Hostess And Spoke Good English- My French Is Terrible To Say The Least. My Wife Finished Off With A Great Coffee And We Liked The Food So Much We Went There Again. I Advised My Daughter Who Is Currently On A University Study Trip To Singapore To Visit This Place Whilst There. Highly Recommended
5
We patronized Entre Nous creperie several times. Never and never and never disappointed. The portions are not that big, but the taste is sublime. Very good place,we love it, we will be back without any doubt. A la prosiem
5
The most authentic crepes I've found in Singapore. They have a large number of options of both sweet and savoury crepes, including a number of vegetarian ones, as well as some other French dishes. Do try their avocado/ tomato crepe and their lemon and sugar crepe. They also have good French cider (expensive though compared to buying a bottle online)Service is attentive and friendly.Will absolutely visit again
5
I stumbled across Entre Nous whilst looking in Tripadvisor for somewhere different to eat in Singapore.It's located just around the corner from the Raffles Hotel in Seah Street and City Hall MRT station is about 5-10 minutes away on foot.On browsing the menu on the cafe's website, I thought it was connected to the Breizh Cafe in Le Marais, Paris but the friendly proprietress told me that they were independent and that they had been operating for nine years.I opted for the Breizh menu at SIN$33, which consisted of a galette of egg, Emmental cheese and ham, a dessert galette with salted caramel sauce and a cup of dry Breton cider.All were excellent, and I treated myself to an additional cup of sweet cider plus an after dinner calvados and flat white.I was so impressed I visited again and this time had a galette with mashed avocado, tomato and garlic and a dessert galette with caramel ice cream.It's certainly worthy of its high ranking in Tripadvisor and offers good value in an expensive city. I will definitely call again when next in Singapore
5
My husband and I visited this lovely creperie on our honeymoon, we fell in love with the food and with the staff! The crepes were soooo delicious (the salty and sweet), and our waitress went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and happy!If you are in Singapore- you must eat there at least once!!!
5
Delicious crêpes and quiche. Very nice owner from France. It feels and tastes like being in France. Not cheap, but worth the money
5
Went to this place because of the review from TripAdvisor, and I wasn't dissapointed. The price was high but worth every penny We tried 1 savory n 1 sweet crepe, and we enjoyed both thoroughly. I especially like the savory one (La Quessant), the combination of flavor just worked and the thin crispy crepe was the cherry on top
3
The crepes are excellent and if you are keen to eat authentic French crepes this is the place to go in Singapore. The menus is comprehensive. Food is good and served promptly. I am a repeat customer and I come for their crepes. Thats all. What I dont like: Ambiance and restaurant decoration is basic to non-existent. The owner-couple is not always the most welcoming. Maybe they are shy or talking to customers is not their thing. There is no credit card payment and that's annoying in the 21st century
4
A small, pleasant cafe. The crepes were good & the service was good. We had just arrived in Singapore & didn't have any cash & they do not accept any debit/credit cards so we had to walk to the nearest ATM & go back & pay for our meal
5
Love the extensive pancake menu with many options. The pancakes taste as good as in France and the outside seating is lovely in the warm weather! We really love the fact that they serve glutenfree pancakes and our daughter really enjoyes being able to eat pancakes at a restaurant as this is the first restaurant we have ever been to that serves glutenfree pancakes :-)
5
First of all, I apologies for my English.My sister and I have eaten two crêpes. Both of them were the same except that mine was gluten-free. As I suffer of gluten tolerence disease I was so happy finding that place and eating such a good crunchy crêpe.Even if the one I chosed wasn't in the"gluten-free" (buckweath says Google "blé noir") menu part, the waitress gently offered me to make the one I wanted without gluten.Definietly a place to go whether or not you're suffering of a disease.The only thing I regret is leaving Singapore before being able to go back in this restaurant again
5
Our family of five visited Entre-Nous after an evening stroll along the Esplanade. We arrived right on closing time but were warmly welcomed - due to our late arrival (around 9.45pm) only the dessert menu was available. We chose a nutella crepes, lemon and sugar crepes and Entre-Nous speciality salted caramel and apple crepe. All were delicious - the crepes being fine and light - as good as we have eaten in France! The highlight of the visit was the gracious host, who herself is from Brittany, France, she was wonderfully friendly and spent some time chatting to us about her life in Singapore and where she grew up n France. Whilst our visit to Entre-Nous was a short one, it was one of the highlights of our stay in Singapore!
4
Wide variety of crepes, ranging from savoury to sweet. Not that cheap but can try it out. Location is near Bugis/Cityhall mrt station.
5
Serving wheat and buckwheat crepes - both sweet and savory - Entre Nous was a great surprise in Singapore
Attentive French hosts. Interesting Specials. Highly recommended.
5
It's always a pleasure to dine here. The crepes are amazing (fresh, crispy and light, and not doughy) and our personal favourite is the omelette (that isn't on their revised menu but they were happy to whip it up for us on request). This is a great place to visit and revisit, especially when there are so many menu options to try for both savoury and sweet crepes. Geraldine's favourite with their homemade salted butter caramel is a fantastic way to round up any dinner
3
Food was delicious, we took two savory galettes: cheese and mushroom, egg and tomato. And a crème brûlé. Total price around $50. After ordering, waited 20-30 minutes for the food to come.However, for people who are not in a hurry, it's could be a nice place to enjoy the crepe. ;)
4
We read all the good reviews... we in fact have passed the road many time... yet today we went for the first time! The crepes are indeed authentic and very delicious - we had two savoury and one sweet crepe. Love the house special with avocado and prawns. The savoury crepe has a nice crisp bite which is memorable. Appreciate having such a eatery in SG
5
We (my family) love this restaurant. The crepes are the best, we cannot have enough of the them. Highly recommended, but please bring cash as the payment is cash term only and reservation prior your visit is advisable
5
We discovered this place via Tripadvisor. I have been to the nearby area many times but never know such a great place exist!We came here on Thu evening 7pm. Half of the tables inside were full. We looked at the tables around us, the crepes all looked delicious. We ordered 2 crepes, one sweet and another savoury. Both are really delicious. The sweet crepes looked very thin and crispy, but it was actually soft inside. Chocolate on top was not sweet, but brought out the flavour. The savoury crepes was filled with eggs, tomatoes, garlic and some herbs. The presentation was very pretty, and tasted even better. There is no strong garlic taste which is what I like. The buckwheat flour based crepes are very soft & light. The crepes are the best I have tried so far, and very suitable for woman or those who are concerned about watching their waistlines.We also couldn't resist the temptation to try their dessert. The dessert of the day was almond & apple cider cake. It was simply amazing! The cake was crispy on the outside, but soft & fluffy inside, the salted butter caramel was excellent.I checked out the toilet after reading others comment. The look and feel of the toilet is acceptable for an old building, but it was clean. However, the flush was not strong, and there were some toilet papers stuck in the toilets. It will be good if the flush can be upgraded, and even better the entire toilet.Overall, food was excellent, and the ambience was nice. Only thing to watch out is they DO NOT accept cards, so please ensure you have sufficient cash to pay.
4
Had all three of the 'Chef recommended ' savoury crepes among the three of us, who visited the place for a Sunday brunch.All three were very good and balanced. We paired them with the cider, which is served Brittany style. For dessert, the salted caramel crepe with ice cream more than did the trick. It's worth getting your hands on the salted caramel itself, which is also sold separately.Slight room for improvement in the restroom department
5
The owner was so friendly and the food was SOOOO delicious. You wouldn't expect it to be that great just by the looks, but after a mouthful your mouth will be in pure ecstacy
5
Lovely food and environment. One of my favourite French restaurants in Singapore. The owner are Super nice and friendly. You must try no.11 ( savoury crepes) and no.33 with homemade lavender ice cream ( sweet crepes) :) and the Apple cider :
5
Entre-Nous has really authentic savory galettes and sweet crêpes, the cider and beers are from Brittany and the staff is very friendly. Highly recommended for lunch or dinner, the menu is worth a try.
5
Great to find gluten free crepes in Singapore. The crepes were tasty and safe for coeliacs. Thank you!
3
The food was decent but compared to a place like Comptoir it was unfortunately overpriced, especially the bowl of cider, all the desserts listed and the lunch menu.
5
Perfect spot for a low key but very filling and delicious lunch. They have a lot of options and don't mind altering if you have an allergy or anything like that.
5
Highly recommend Entre-Nous Creperie. Not only was the food amazing but has some of the most friendliest staff of all the Singapore restaurants my wife and I have visited. We celebrated my wife's birthday and it was topped off by the ladies sorting out the birthday candle for the dessert.Thank you so much for helping me celebrate my wife's birthday
4
Not far from Bugi St station in Seah St, a smaller street off Beach Rd. Quite small as far as inside tables go, plenty outside, which we sat at because they are busy at lunch time without a booking. The food was quick to come and spot on, prawn & avocado crepe with roast chicken & avocado crepe for the coeliac one, followed by Creme brûlée of course. Ran by friendly French lady and French waitress, it was a good experience to eat here. If you don't like the heat and want to be inside for sure book ahead
5
This is one of our family's favourite restaurants. The service is excellent. The French Onion Soup is delicious. Our favourite crepes are the Mushroom and Emmenthal Cheese crepe and the Goat Cheese with Honey crepe. And of course there is the dessert. The Stephan's favourite has bananas, chocolate sauce and chocolate ice cream. Yummy
4
Last year I stayed at Montparnasse, Paris for a month. During my stay, I came across Brittany crêperie. I just love it especially the savory galette. Since I came back to Singapore, I have been craving for it. I had tried at a few places in Singapore but to me this place served the best galette. It was thin, crispy & fine. So glad that I found this restaurant, Entre-Nous crêperie!
5
My husband and I visited this creperie recently while we were in Singapore and the quality of the crepes was truly excellent. I sampled one of the sweet crepes with homemade chocolate sauce. The crepe was cooked beautifully and the chocolate sauce was delicious. The quality of the chocolate used is clearly extremely high. My husband had a savoury crepe and he too was equally impressed. The service was also very friendly and efficient. We would definitely return the next time we are in Singapore
3
We revisited this restaurant again after a wonderful experience. Food was consistent and they have wonderful food. But this does not deserve to be on TOP of the Singapore restaurant list. Not even TOP 50. The french owner is a wonderful lady and the place has seen a massive increase in patronage in the past month due to trip advisor. However they are understaffed and the waiters are horribly trained. She got a nice Philippino lady as a waitress on a Saturday and a young french school girl to help out but they were lost in what the menu served and totally did not know how to even settle the bill. Nice customers were waiting for 20 minutes for their bills and not until the owners came to help out from the kitchen did they start moving the que. The kitchen is understaffed to deal with the increase customers and it is a nice place to eat but does not I repeat deserve a TOP 50 ratin
3
Been craving for crepes since my fiancé and I left Europe and so glad we're able to come across this place. They offer both savoury and sweet crepes. My personal fave is of course the sweet crepes which is distinctively light and delectable.
5
Very tasty crêpes an also wonderful desserts.
The service was also very good, done by the owners, an extremely kind and frendly French couple.
5
Amazing restaurant, the best french creperie in Singapore! The food was delicious and the ambiance awesome, a real french creperie. Waitress was nice and smiling. I strongly recommand the restaurant
5
I am a crepe lover and have been searching for good crepes especially Bretagne crepes for a long time. Entre nous is definitely BY FAR the best and most authentic and delicious crepes I have had in Asia for awhile.The place is cozy and cute and owners are passionate and very welcoming. Would highly recommend and return
5
I am Scottish and have just returned from visiting members of my family in Singapore. Five of us ate here to our delight last Friday evening. I don't want to repeat the consistent, well justified compliments of almost every previous review. That's hardly necessary. But I would wish to endorse all the unifying essentials: the authenticity of the dishes, the quality of the cooking, the careful, helpful service. All of this is ensured by the friendliness and attentiveness of the owners who so evidently take pride and pleasure in bringing excellence to every aspect of the customer experience. The exalted position this little creperie occupies in Tripadvisor's listing attests to their success in this and is well merited. Prices are very correct for this quality of dining in Singapore and one recommendation, if I may, the organic cider which is the most expensive is rather special.I hope it's helpful if I add that I have an in-depth awareness of France and am completely fluent in French which I taught at University before retirement
3
Good crepes but not that exceptional for the price which is...exceptionally high unfortunately :-( You can find more competitive crepes in Singapore for the same pric
4
Usually i go earlier, but this sunday went at peak hour: 12.30. The place was buzzing; poor Geraldine and Stephan had lots to do. We got a table quickly, service was prompt, and most importantly-even though Stephan was working virtually alone in the kitchen, the crepes were of the same excellent quality, and served piping hot. Love the salted caramel desert crepe. Come earlier if you cannot stand crowd
5
I had the goat cheese crepe with honey and herbs -- to die for! One of the best meals I've had in a long time. My mom had the shrimp and avocado crepe -- very unusual, in a good way, and tasty. Excellent cider from Brittany. Highly recommend. Thank you, Geraldine!
4
It's possibly the only place in Singapore you can find a decent crÃªperie that brings authentic brittany crepes, ambience like that of one found in Brittany The crepes are delicious and brings me back to France each time. The ambience lined with ornaments of the sea and pictures of lighthouses is cute and homely. The couple who own the place are really nice and friendly, I love that they serve cider traditionally in a bowl! Overall I would recommend it to any one who wants to have a proper taste of French crepes.The only down side is that it is quite pricy for what it is, but it's a hell lot cheaper than flying to france for it
4
We paid a visit after reading good review of the palce in Tripadvisor, and we did not regret it! The place is quite small, and reservation maybe needed if you do not want to wait for 30 - 40 mins. During our lunch, we saw 3 guests being "rejected" since the place was already full. We had their "Mother's Day Set Menu", and we liked all their food- scallop for entree- avocado and shrimp crepes for main- banana sweet crepes for dessert- sweet apple cider for the drink! We noticed that they use imported ingredients for the food, so it is not cheap.. I think we will go there again for the crepes, but the service should be better to maintain the customers' happines
5
As good as in Brittany! Excellent crepes and salted caramel. good cider as well. Nice Brittany pictures in the wall And friendly staff.
4
I was looking for a taste from my home country and definitely got it! The galettes here are really good quality and the people handling the place are super nice.You will find the classic range of traditional galettes and crepes...try them all! Worth it. Will come back for sure
5
We stopped at Entre-Nous as it was near our hotel. It was a very good decision as the food was awesome ! Everything was very good but we loved the "Geraldine's Favorite" for desert: salt caramel with apple and a delicious home made vanilla Ice. We'll go back 
5
I am a big crepes lover (being French) and have looked and looked and these are the best crepes in Singapore. Simply delicious, just like in France. From there... nice place, convenient location, adorable owner and good service are just icing on the cake.
5
We went to entre nous because it is very close to our hotel. My wife ordered the Shrimp and avocado and I went for the ham cheese and egg. It was delicious ! The real crepe as in France! For desserts we had one caramel with salted butter (a classic in France) and one banana chocolate : both were to die for !! We will definitely come back
5
The buckwheat crepes are delightful. It is a gluten free heaven. We enjoyed both the savoury and sweet crepes. We also enjoyed the French cider and wine. The owners are friendly and helpful. We have eaten there both nights of our stopover. Highly recommend
4
not the cheapest dessert place, but friendly staff and the crepes were amazing! definitely going back again to try more items on their men
5
We find this creperie through trip advisor and the great reviews were justified. The crepes were delicious and very filling. We had five different types of crepes and they were all outstanding, but two that were surprisingly good were the avocado with prawn and the spinach with salmon.We will definitely be back and try some other flavors
5
My husband and I first came here in late 2010. It was one of our best dates (also because he is French and I love crêpes). Since then, we came here quite regularly and to dine during special events (Valentine's, Christmas, New Year's and Anniversaries). My favourite crêpe is the Geraldine's Favourite- it is with chicken drizzled with caramelised onions, all my favourite ingredients. Little did I know that the lovely hostess was named Geraldine. She and her husband settled in Singapore from France to run this authentic and cosy crêperie. In 2014, my husband and I moved to Paris. We visited Singapore again this year and decided to reignite our special moments at Entre-Nous for Valentine's. It was incredibly wonderful to be received by Geraldine once again after years (and with my fluent French this time around). We never hesitated to get the full menu and plenty of cider, and they never disappoint. We are always looking forward to our next visit here as we know that each time it is special. ❤️(Photos were from Christmas Eve, 2011
5
A great recommendation from a French friend. The galettes and crepes were amazing! Even the milkshakes were divine. Will definitely come back!
5
Came here for dinner! Love the pretty quiet environment :D good for conversations! The savoury crepes were awesome and did not disappoint me!!
5
Simply the best crepe in Singapore, portion is big, everything was fresh and delicious. Will return in no time

Lovely family restaurant with a homey kind of vibe. We go there at least once a week ever since we discovered it. It specialises in Crepes, they have savoury crepes, gastronomic crepes if you are looking for more sophisticated flavours and sweet crepes.They also serve great wine, home made cider beer, liqueurs and coffee.Great Service and Value for money! Must visit

If you want to feel in Brittany, entre nous crepes take you there: the crepes are amazing and the people friendly, like in Brittany.Some of the crepes are named after beautiful location, like Glenan and Groix. You should look it up to complete the experience...

just went for dinner last night, the owner was attentive and friendly. crepes were very good, especially loved the crepe with avocado mixed with cream and garlic, with fresh prawns and tomatoes
5
Read rave reviews about this place and just had to pay a visit due to my wife's dietary requirements.Visited on a Saturday evening and had to sit outside as we hadn't made any reservation.Received a very warm welcome from Geraldine who is a delightful hostess.Plenty of fillings to choose from and one crepe is satisfyingly sufficient. You can then wash it down with a mug of cider - the proper French way.Enjoyed it so much that we visited again on Tuesday lunchtime (sitting inside) before having to return home that evening.Can't wait to return to Singapore and this will definitely be top of the list to revisit. Merci beaucoup Geraldine. À bientôt

We know the creperie "entre-nous" for the past 9 years, and we have never ever been disappointed by the quality of their food. Their crepes are just delicious! If you want a cultural and culinary experience made in Brittany, this is the place to go in Singapore. Well done to Stephane and Geraldine
5
We enjoyed our first lunch at Entre Nous so much, that we came back again the day after. Their original French galettes (gluten-free!) can be ordered with a big variety of either savoury or sweet fillings. The ones we had were absolutely over the top! Especially their homemade salted caramel butter is extraordinary and really worth trying. Service was fast and very friendly. Thank you very much Géraldine for the authentic experience! Natacha & Mara (the Swiss girls travelling through Asia

This restaurant makes the best French crêpes in Singapore, like if you were having an escape in French Brittany. The host couple is very friendly and will make sure you enjoy the experience. The salted-butter caramel crêpe is a must try. Delicious! We will definitely come back
5
I love this place! I went because of the good reviews and didn't disappoint. Very good service, nice place and the most important, amazing and incredible food. Everything was delicious and I cannot wait to come back again to try more of their creations. I'm from Spain and I miss European food a lot, eating here was a great experience and felt like home again! I will repeat for sure!! If you go, make sure to get a sweet crepe each, they are too good to share ;
5
Best crepes in Singapore! Both savoury and sweet crepes are really good. Good service.
Will definitely go back.
5
I had an awesome crepe with a nice glass of red wine. Service was excellent and the place/ mood is authentic French. A bientôt!

Quite expensive for crepes - almost $18 for a Nutella crepe with a scoop of ice cream but went anyway as there is a gluten free option which isn't the easiest to find in singapore.The Nutella crepe gluten free was made with buckwheat flour - what they normally use for savoury crepes so it was distinctly salty for a dessert crepe base, but apart from that, nothing to complain as gluten free options are still limited on this island.
5
My husband and I have been dining at Entre Nous for years! It is hands down the best creperies in Singapore. The savoury buckwheat galettes are done to perfection - I usually go for the egg, cheese and ham galette, which sounds simple but is so yummy. My husband has his with an additional fresh mushroom bÃ©chamel sauce. And we enjoy all this with a refreshing bottle of cider. We always finish off with a dessert - their sweet crepe with homemade salted butter caramel is a definite must ...sometimes we don't even share it, we have one each. The service is warm and friendly and the restaurant is perfect for brunch with friends, lunch with family or even dinner with a loved one. Once you've tried their galettes and crepes, you will keep coming back for more
5
Our family regularly goes to Entre-Nous Creperie and has never been disappointed.Their menu is very varied and appealing; their ciders are a great complement to the meals. The service is quick and precise; Geraldine, the owner, has always a smile and kind words for every guest. The restaurant interior design is simple yet has a certain "Brittany charm", it is very clean, quiet and very well located.Price wise, we find that the money is worth the crepes! It is fairly priced especially considering that the ingredients are fresh and really 'made in France'.It is always a pleasure to be there and we definitely recommend it to tourists or new customers. If you are a family, bring your kids there too, they will love it
5
Went there for lunch as it was close to the office. It a small inconspicous place. Lunch was excellent and it felt like being in Brittany. Service is very attentive and friendly. Food is served fresh and fast. Best Crepes so far I have ever had. Coffee was also good which shows that the owners are paying attention to every detail and definitely shows that the restaurant's top rank is not a coincidence.Keep in mind the prices for lunch in this area are on the upper side but Ialso understand that good quality costs something and I am more than happy to pay this for what you get
5
If you are looking for authentic crepes and galettes this is the place.I am from Brittany and never liked the galettes there, I used to have cheese and savoury ingredients on sweet crepes. I had give a try to galettes there and there are just amazing. This is the only place where I like the galettes.This is so good , I could easily eat there every day without getting bored. I you want fresh and delicious food this is the place, I bet you won't be disapoointed.Enjoy the crepes for me, I wish I live there to eat it more often. Bon appeti
5
We made the most of our kids' Easter holidays to come to our favourite creperie! I come from near St. Malo and was excited to be able to introduce my family to a genuine Breton creperie in Singapore. The Chef and his charming Wife are from Brittany and the cuisine is "delicious" to quote my Daughter. We love the original buckwheat galettes with a wide choice for all of the family. My Wife enjoyed the avocado, roast chicken and garlic cream galette. The escargot and soup were also excellent. The sweet crepes are scrumptious. They also have my favourite cider. Service is very family friendly and it is like finding a home from home. We have always had a fantastic experience here no matter how busy and so I am very pleased to finally write a review
5
What struck me the most abut this cosy, lovely restaurant is the excellent quality of the products and the combinations of the ingredient. They are so original and sound so yummy that it's really hard to choose what to order! I shared four crepes with my boyfriend and all of them were absolutely divine! The wine list is great too.Service is warm, friendly and attentive.I travel very often to France but I have to say these were by far the best crepes I ever had! BRAVO LE GARS
5
Went there with my 2 daughters. Both loved the food and dessert there. Had a nice meal with awesome service. One of the best crepes one can find in Singapore. Extensive menu that caters to those looking for sweet, savoury or both. The owner herself Geraldine, explained the various items on the menu to us. Will definitely visit again
5
Authentic crepes from Brittany that will remind any French person of home. The homemade salted butter caramel is to die for!
4
Went there for late breakfast and it was great. Omelettes are really good and maple syrup crepe is delicious. Not mind blowing but good enough to try.
4
Creperie Entre-Nous is a cafe-like restaurant with hipster vibes. The menu boasts a wide range of both sweet and savoury crepes. Great for all ages!
I recommend the Crepe Suzette.
5
We had lunch at this lovely little creperie and enjoyed delicious buckwheat galettes. We did find it a little on the pricey side but very enjoyable
5
Entre-nous crêperie is a little piece of France, or better Brittany, in Singapore. Their sweet crêpes and savoury galettes are well-made and very tasty. The menu offers a wide choice of toppings. In addition, they offer typical French bistro drinks like menthe à l'eau (still water with peppermint syrup), and if you fall in love with their salted caramel, you can even buy some to take home with you. I thoroughly recommend this gem to anyone who's looking for some authentic French crêpes and having a good time
4
The crepes were the best I have ever eaten, even though the lady which greeted us was not very friendly. We had 3 of the crepes title favourites and 1 with ice cream. They were all fantastic, each having a unique and delectable taste. I would definitely visit again since it is value for money. (Around 15-20 dollars per pax
5
Whenever I come to Singapore I make a point to add a few extra hours to my transit to visit Entre-Nous. A trip to Singapore is not a good online unless I have visited. They serve both sweet and savoury crepes and I still cannot decide which is my favourite - but I make sure to have one of each every time I come. The coffee they serve is always lovely and like the crepes I always have a seconds. The restaurant is owned by a French couple who have been in Singapore for 8 years. Their warm and friendly nature is always lovely and makes you feel like you are not in Singapore. They are always chatty and interested in getting to know their customers. Highly recommended!!

Finding suitable food for 2 coeliacs in Singapore has not proved easy, so discovering a little Breton creperie where pancakes can be made either with wheat or pure buckwheat (NOT related to wheat) was a joy. Although we were the only diners early on a Wednesday evening, the place is obviously busy at lunchtimes. Great choice of authentic Breton ciders as well as beers and a huge range of fillings. Everything freshly cooked and beautifully presented. Plenty of desserts too. Recommended strongly to any of the gluten intolerant or coeliacs out there who must also find being surrounded by soy sauce and breaded products challenging
4
I tried a savory and a sweet crepe. The savory one was with cheese and ham and egg, and it was really nothing special. The cheese they use for it was not ideal, the egg and ham were only average quality, and the final taste was fairly bland. The sweet crepe on the other hand was wonderful. I chose one with caramel and apples, and this tasted wonderful, reminding me of apple strudels my mom made when I was a child. The price was fair, and service was kind
4
Stopped by for a late afternoon snack. We ordered a ham and mushroom savoury crepe and a whipped cream dessert crepe to share. They were delicious and not a disappointment at all. If I were to nitpick, the savoury was just a tad salty and the dessert crepe a tad sweet. But it was tasty and we are likely to be back.Withholding a 5th star in the rating because it is actually expensive for the portion you get. The crepes will not fill you alone and the bill will run high very fast to order the works. They also charged for water. And no credit cards
5
The crêpes we had, were delicious . Although filled with cheese, chicken, vegetables, the crêpes themselves were still crispy. Finally we got some real good cheese in Signapore! The service was very nice and friendly.
5
Amazing crepes. Lovely host. Best ham I have ever tasted in my life. A must do if you are ever in Singapore and have a hankering for authentic Crepes!
5
I was impressed by the quality of the crêpes and the impeccable service. By far the best crêpe experience I have had in Singapore. Highly recommended!
4
The restaurant environment is relaxing, service provided is very friendly and the food quality is very good. Love their sweet creperie.
5
Amazing little place with an ambience that felt really authentic. Savoury crepes were delicious and the sweet cider was to die for, we'll definitely be back!
5
We went for dinner here this evening. It was fantastic from start to finish. From excellent service to delicious food all round. Really attentive staff who made great recommendations on menu choices. Salted butter caramel was just delightful! Will definitely be back. Just wish I'd found it sooner. If you can a chance - go! You'll not be disappointed
5
The manager running this restaurant, French, is the real deal. She is awesome, and worked with me to assure gluten free and zero risk of cross-contamination. Gluten free or not, this place is great, delicious, and authentic Crapes. I would put this in the MUST VISIT category while in Singapore. Oh, and don't forget the cider. They have a great brand, nice and cold for humid Singapore nights. Enjoy, visit this restaurant with confidence, and enjoy chatting with the wonderful woman running this place (I am sorry I don't recall her name)
5
Went there two nights in a row for their homemade sweet crepes. A rare find in Singapore which specialises in savoury and sweet crepes. Like that the crepe is light and not too sweet even with the toppings on it. Will definitely come again more often and try the savoury.
4
This creperie is really authentic, managed by a French family. The guy is handling the kitchen and preparing excellent authentic crepes, both savory with buckwheat flour, and sweet with the usual flour. The lady is taking care of the service, and provides it in a quick and attentive manner.Enjoy the cider direct from Brittany. Have also a sip of Chouchen, a typical honey liquor from Brittany
5
I had dinner at entre nous creperie a few days ago and as usual i felt i was in France, somewhere in Brittany as the quality of the crepes and of the galettes ( savoury) is really excellent ... i like simple aromas so i always choose the ham- cheese and egg ( very traditional) .. Also, i really recommend anyone to enjoy some cidre brut with that ... and not water or other soda ... the cidre brut has a very good aroma balanced with the acidity and this is the perfect pairing with a nice galette ! To start with a sweet note , i d go for the caramel au beurre salÃ© ( salty butter caramel) as this is unique , especially when the caramel is melting in the crepe 
4
Cosy atmosphere combined with entrepreneurial spirit. Homemade and delicious food with warm service. Definately worth trying for crepes lovers!
5
Endless choice of galettes and crepes which are excellent, even better than in some creperie I tried in France.
The chef is from there,no wonder they are so good and authentic.
I highly recommend this restaurant for the quality of food and service.
4
A nice pause for lunch. Really nearby Raffles Hotel. A great variety of fillings, the only problem will be to choose!!
4
Lovely authentic crepes, very filling and satisfying. Owners are also pleasant and lovely to talk to. Went with a group of friends and everyone gave it 2 thumbs up!
5
Perfect crepes and galletes. Outdoor seating, undercover, to watch the world go by, whilst enjoying traditional authentic dishes. Agree with most of what's already been said - galletes were delicious. Cash only.
5
Visited with family for late lunch.Onion soup is best one i've had anywhere around the globe. And the caramel crepe was to die for. Owners are a lovely french family that were super kind and friendly. Great service. After having spent a couple of weeks in Thailand, prices seemed steep, but then again, it was probably moderate for Singapore. Seating area is small and crammed, but cosy. Definitely a must visit
4
Small cozy restaurant with good attentive service. It specialises in crepes and one of my Favourite food when I visited Europe was their amazing savoury and sweet crepes! It definitely brought the taste of Europe back for me at least. Food is good and interestingly, the restaurant's recommend dishes were named after the people working there i.e Geraldine's Favourite, Stephan's Favourite, this adds a personal and homley touch to the overall dining experience. I brought my mum and Uncle during my second visit and they love it, though they never tried eating crepes before. During our visit the restaurant is filled with quite a number of French speaking diners, so I guess this speaks lot for their French authenticity.Downside of this restaurant is that you have to pay your food in cash, though there's a ATM at bras Basah complex, I did experience when the ATM ran out of cash, so do bring enough dough along with you if you intend to dine there. Overall this restaurant is definitely worth a visit, and i would definitely go back there again, with more cash! :
4
This little place is very low key and not fussy at all. The galettes (buckwheat pancakes) were fantastic though! It wasn't a cheap meal, but was very substantial and I would like to return! It's conveniently located behind Raffles arcade and is really a great lunch
4
The crepes are so good! We ordered Stephan's Favourite, La Groix and Entre-Nous. Will recommend friends and definitely be back for more!Very cozy setting with friendly service.Cash only though, so remember to bring more money with you, as it is more than $70 for what we ordered above (inclusive of 2 drinks)
5
We use to go here very often, wonderful creps, even better than any other place in France! With good ciders and beers from France and a menu plenty of different ways to have creps, it really worth it Location in the heart of Singapore in a nice area to walk or shopping aroundTotally recommended ;)
5
Second visit and the host were very friendly and welcoming. The salty caramel crepe is just amazing. Thank you.
4
He is place has a wide variety of crepes sweet and savoury , as recommended by someone we tried the avocado mash
5
If only my stomach was bigger so that I could've eaten more. The food here was just perfect and incredible value for money when compared to some places that charge twice the price for lesser quality.
Lovely service. We will be back.
5
Absolutely delicious crepes, the atmosphere couldn't have been friendlier!!!
The menu is amazing, we were spoiled for choices!!! So many choices!!!
It really was a great experience! Thank you.
5
Saw this restaurant on Trip Advisor and it wasn't far from our hotel, so of course had to go. We are huge fans of the Breton creperies in France, and this little restaurant was as good as any we went to in Paris. Do try the cider - it is imported and exactly like the cider we had in France. The crepes were delicious and we even managed to share a sweet crepe for dessert. The chef is French. We left stuffed and the prices were very reasonable. Yum
5
I love going to Entre-Nous for lunch. A good combination of savory and sweet crepes is offered along with quiche, soup and salad selections. It is a small but cozy place so if you intend to go as a big group, better to call in advance and make a reservation. Service is a tad on the slower side as there is only one lady who waits all the tables but service is always friendly and they have never got an order wrong. My favorite crepes are the nutella and banana and salted caramel - YUM! They are always served fresh and never cold or undercooked. Highly recommend this place
4
There's a wide range of both savoury and sweet crepes. We ordered two savoury crepes Entre-Nous which is one of the chef's recommendation, La Hoedic (spinach, goat's cheese and. Bacon bits) and shared a sweet crepe topped with their lovely homemade salted butter caramel, also named after the creperie. The avocado mash went rather well with the tomatoes, garlic and prawns. All flavours were well balanced. I was expecting a strong goat's cheese taste but it was lovely and not overpowering at all
5
After a 10 day business trip to Singapore, we decided to try something different - the tiny charming casual Entre Nous, which has both delicious sweet and savory crepes, hit the spot. Be sure to get cash before you go as they do not take credit cards. For estimating purposes, GST is built into their prices, so the only extra fee is the 10% service charge. I ordered the price fixe Entre Nous (soup or salad, savory crepe, sweet crepe, and drink) which was very reasonably priced. If you get the same, you will leave stuffed but satisfied. After making 7:30pm dinner reservation via TripAdvisor (they use a system called Chope), we took the MRT to China Town to shop and then a nice walk to the restaurant (please note, if you blink you miss the restaurant when you walk by). Conveniently, there is also an MRT nearby for the return trip home. Although there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant, since it is tiny this was not a problem and she did a fantastic job and was very attentive. By the way, I would definitely get the items I ordered again - #5 crepe (emmental cheese, mushrooms, bechamel sauce) and Geraldine's Favorite dessert crepe (caramel, apples, icecream). Yummm
5
A regular customer there have introduced us to this place. We happen to like crepes and have ordered a few orders on crepes. I especially find crepe with caramel top with a scoope of vanilla ice cream delicious. The crepe is thin and there are several selection of flavours like chocolate, cheese etc. It is also my first time trying lavendar flavoured ice cream with maple syrup crepe. I have my apple cider in a nice porcelain tea cup, too.You can have your mains before crepes as they carries some selection of food ala french and wines too. Will be heading down soon to try their mains. Good cozy evening with friends and couples. A small setting with not many seats. Hence, do made reservation to ensure availability.
5
We were only in Singapore for the weekend and chose to eat here for Saturday lunch. Both of our crepes were delicious - I had prawns with avocado and my husband had the salmon. Simple and clean flavours and lovely service. Enjoyed chatting to the owner while hubby went to an ATM (he'd lost $50... unhappy wife!) Price was higher than what we usually pay for a lunch, but everything is pricey in Singapore so we thought it was fair. We were happy to pay for good food and we will definitely visit again when we return to Singapore in July.
5
The crepes were simply fantastic, so fresh and delicious and healthy (organic buckwheat flour!). Service was super too. Definitely worth every cent. Will be back for more!
5
Located just behind Raffles hotel, this crêperie serves delicious organic crepes just like in France. They also have great imported bear from Brittany or cider to enjoy with your crepes. We will definitely come back with friends. Highly recommended.
5
The food quality is generally good, however, the best is their dessert. The crepes are great. The service is fast and friendly as well
5
Simple, delightful creperie in the heart of the city that unlike many other fancier-looking eateries around paid attention to what was important: delicious, authentic food and great service. You will also be happily surprised by the selection of sweet and savoury crepes!
4
Small restro, but quaint and very nice owners. Crepes are good, location is as well. Would go again!
5
We first chanced upon this quaint little cafe 7-8 years ago. It is owned by a lovely french couple, and the crispy buckwheat crepes filled with fresh toppings (avocado, emmental cheese and others!) were not like any other crepes I've ever had in Singapore, so yummy! After a 6 year hiatus (somehow we forgot to go back or something), we finally made it back and the food quality hadn't changed one bit - still so satisfying and authentic. We normally have the set menu (of either 2 or 3 crepes) because 1 just ain't enough, and although we're normally fully stuffed after dinner, the food seems to digest quickly! It is a little pricey but well worth every cent
5
Found this place as it came up first in my search for gluten-free meals. Absolutely love this chic eatery that serves fresh and authentic crepes straight from the kitchen. The drinks were fantastic too (ciders with blackcurrant) and desserts to die for. Perfect for those who are looking for a meal that's fuss free, light and satisfying. Bit pricey but it's worth it. My friends simply adore this place! I am definitely going back each time I crave for crepes!!! Yummms!!
5
We were in Singapore for just a bit over a day, and arrived at lunch time - this creperie (down the street from our hotel) was the perfect speed for a quick and delicious lunch. Perfectly authentic Breton savory buckwheat crepes and very friendly service. And a nice change of pace after a week eating locally in Cambodia. A lovely oasis of calm in Singapore.
5
I was actually craving pancakes and accidently found this place and it was the best choice. There is a variety of options you can choose from and even make your own Crepe. You can choose from salty and sweet Crepes in addition to good coffee and deserts. The staff was nice and helpful, in general a good atmosphere and cozy place for brunch
4
The food by itself is delicious, both savory and sweet crepes, the cider and the coffee. So if you judge by the food itself, this is a 5 star place. However there are 3 things they could improve: 1) accept credit cards (or at least put a sign saying you only accept cash) 2) provide wifi and 3) deliver food faster
5
Its an experience dining here and if you close your eyes, you can almost imagine yourself transported to france
5
Delicious and Gluten free ! delicious pancakes in a relax atmosphere. Owner very sensitive to our gluten free request. I definitively recommend and we will be back when in Singapore next time.
5
We went to Entre-Nous for a lunch and it was very nice.
Crepes are very good and affordable.
Thanks again.
5
We frequented this crêperie quite often as it is the only authentic one around (forget Paul's or others from similar resto joints!!) - validated as per French standard.We always ordered one savory and one sweet crepes for each of us accompanied by their apple cider.. i like the brut and my spouse likes the sweet.But yesterday we had special Valentine's day menu. The escargot starter was delicious - even the baguette that came with it was very nice. The scallop crepes with leek cream as the main dish was super delicious. This is not a standard menu I believe and only available for this special menu. The scallops were fresh and well cooked. The crepes itself was devine.I had caramel crepes with apples and it was very very nice. My spouse had white chocolate crepes with lavender ice-cream (not a big fan of lavender ice cream though) but the crepes itself as usual was very very nice.All the meals accompanied by "Kirr Brieton" (Apple Cider with blackcurrant syrup - i think). It's a nice change from normal cider but I personally prefer the cider.The nice meal was concluded with coffee + marzipan + flower :)A must visit for anyone looking for delicious authentic crepes with friendly service.
5
I've always been hesitant writing a good review here because it's such a hidden gem! This place serves one of the best crepes I've eaten and it's usually very cozy (not your usual crazy crowded restaurant). The crepes are fresh and healthy (some buckwheat flour?) and the portion is just right. Just watch yourself overeating because one is really never enough. We usually go for sweet crepes after (: It might get a little pricey for the crepes with more ingredients (about $18.90 onwards) but there are good simple ones for about $15.90. Overall, you're still paying for quality. Highly recommended
5
The galettes are all delicious, crispy on the edges and moist at the centre. The sweet crêpes are equally good: the simple one with salty caramel is a real hit. A cup of dry cider will make the perfect companion for the food. Service is very efficient and friendly.
5
I first discovered Entre-Nous some years ago while walking along Seah Street. Their crepes are made with care and are delicious. I've returned quite a number of times over the years and I've enjoyed all my meals there. I recently learnt that one of my good friends actually dines there quite regularly. We decided to celebrate our friend's birthday there on Wednesday and then I returned on Friday for lunch with a different group of friends just this week!The menu seemed a little pricey when I first looked at it years ago but I was won over by the quality of the food and the warm service. I haven't quite found another place like this in Singapore.Savoury crepes I'd recommend:- La Belle-Île-en-Mer (goat cheese, herbs and honey)- La Arz (smoked salmon, chives, creme fraiche and lemon)- La Ouessant (egg, ham, emmental cheese and mushrooms)Dessert crepes:I've actually only repeatedly ordered Geraldine's favourite because I really like it! It's served with salted butter caramel, cooked apple and vanilla ice cream.On a side note, I would also love to learn a little more about the stories behind the names of crepes on the menu! I look forward to dining at Entre-Nous again
5
A pretty place in close proximity to anything. I am pleasantly surprised that they do buckwheat pancakes so yay for GF people. I did not ask but probably they still contain eggs but a vegan cant ask too much in Singapore. Great selection for vegetarians as well. Tasty, and beautiful serving. I would cone here for a date or with friends.
5
No. 18 on the menu was excellent: cheese, ham, and mushrooms with a lovely egg yolk in the centre and yummy béchamel sauceNo. 20 was great as well: roasted chicken with tasty mustard sauceFor dessert, Geraldine's favourite really hit the spot with its salted caramel sauce, apple slices, and homemade vanilla ice creamService was wonderful & attentive, with a special shout-out to Geraldine herself
5
After having walked through Chinatown, Marina Bay, and the rest of the Downtown Core, I was dying to find a reasonably priced, quality meal. Being the self-proclaimed "foodie" that I am, I made a strong effort to find a restaurant that would accommodate a low/mid-range budget during lunch, but had some difficulty in finding anything appealing. While French crepes were not the food I originally had it mind, this establishment fulfilled every desire I had in service, quality, and overall experience.Upon entering, I was greeted with a warm "Bonjour!" which was welcome in a city where English, Chinese, and Malay are prevalent. I was seated at small table near the back of the restaurant with a wonderful view of the very beautifully decorated alley-style interior. The space makes you feel as though you stepped into a cafe in Brittany, with light, pleasant music playing in the background, and the smell of fresh coffee and bread wafting through the air.The waitress (who's name now escapes me...urg!) did a wonderful job of making me feel at home, explaining the menu, and recommending some of the favorites of the staff. I ended up ordering the "La Ouessant" crepe to go along with my coffee. Given, I had worked up quite an appetite since my breakfast stroll through Chinatown, but that should not overshadow how AMAZED I was at the flavor and quality of the food...IN---CREDIBLE; easily one of the best "hit-the-spot" meals I've had in Singapore. Not only was the food delicious, but the meal (including two sparkling waters, two coffees, a small salad) came in very affordable. Of course, I couldn't help myself from trying a dessert round as well, and highly enjoyed the melt-in-your-mouth sweetness of the "Geraldine's Favorite."The restaurant is located across the north side of the Raffles hotel complex, sandwiched in between a few forgettable stores, but don't let the subtle exterior fool you into missing a real gem. I will surely return, and look forward to experiencing more of the fine cooking that Entre-Nous has to offer
5
Glad we found this gem of a place! They serve delicious dessert crepes and savoury galettes (made from buckwheat) which we first had in France and were craving back in Asia. Lovely quaint atmosphere and decor too.
5
Very good quality and texture of the crepes, it is like beeing back home for the time of a lunch. Love the Breizh Menu with cider. quick and effective service
5
Just finished a yummy dinner of both savoury and sweet crepes with my family.
Nearly the whole menu can be made gluten free....was wonderful to have so many options!!
The staff were lovely and we definitely plan on returning.
4
We passed by Entre-Nous and decided to try out some crepes. Tried the crepe suzette and the salted caramel, and I must say, the salted caramel was amazing! Service staff was pretty attentive too.
5
Best crepes I've had in Singapore. My 3rd time there! Creative menu. The chef's recommendation no. 18 on the menu is served hot, smokey and crisp on the outside and warm and moist with a soft egg yolk at the centre. Yum! I also like the sweet caramelized ice cream on a crepe with dessicated coconut.Geraldine was also such a dear and ever- attentive host. She also kept our reservation despite the fact that we were 15min late.The only point to improve is the washroom. It could do with some upgrading
5
We are coming here regularly, and are never disappointed. They serve the classical Brittanny crepes like egg + cheese + ham + mushrooms (our favorite, with a bottle of dry cider!). They also offer sweet crepes which can come with chocolate, caramel, baked apples... (many variations to choose from). The crepes are cooked to the perfection: crispy on the side, and yet, not too dry
5
My girlfriend wanted to have crepes, and we went based on a friend's recommendation. I couldn't be happier as the place reminded me of the crepes I had at CrÃ¨perie d'Yvoire in France. From the traditional-tasting savoury to wonderfully crafted fusion to the sweet desserts, the crepes at Creperie Entre-Nous are unique in Singapore. I would say if you ever have a crepe craving, you know where to look for in Singapore
4
I have been to the place twice and am already planning to visit it more often. Consistent crepes that are done nice and crisp. Love their salted caramel and grand mariner - both are must tries!Best are reasonable. Only issue is cash terms only which isn't too big a problem as the cash machine is just 2 minutes walk away
5
I have been coming to Entre Nous regularly since it opened years ago whenever I need a Breton crepe fix. Their savoury crepes are always light and tasty, especially the one with egg, ham, mushrooms in a bechamel sauce. YUM. Don't miss their sweet crepes too. I love their salted caramel crepes and the lemon sorbet ones. A lovely way to end the meal. What I can't understand is why it isn't more crowded?
5
Start with Blinis. Small thumb size pancakes topped with smoked salmon, cream, caviar, lemon. Followed by very sumptuous buckwheat galette with savoury fillings. Sip glasses of cider in the company of good friends or a good book. Perfect for brunch on a lazy Saturday or Sunday.

Nostalgic dinner at Entre-Nous! Wonderful crepe and cider from France. If you wish to have a nice French crepe in Singapore this is definitely the place!
5
I have started coming quite regularly to this small restaurant for its delicious crepes. The set lunch is very decently priced, the crepes are consistently good and I always the cider. The lady in charge is very welcoming and attentive.
4
This is a cute creperie, needs some renovation to be honest but the crepes are great! I ordered a nutella crepe then asked for another because it was so good!
5
Our dinner started off to a good note when my friend realized they served ciders imported from France. We ordered one to share before moving on to our crepes. We ordered 4 crepes (3 savoury and 1 sweet) among 3 people and thoroughly enjoyed each one.Favourite of the night was still Geraldine's Favourite.. The salted caramel sauce was well balanced and went well with the apples and vanilla ice cream
4
A colleague recommended this place so we decided to give it a try and ordered the La Ouessant, Geraldine's favourite and Crépe Suzette.La Ouessant was our favourite; a savoury crepe with hints of smokey flavours, mild and aromatic emmental cheese, topped with button mushrooms and a sunny side up egg in the middle.We ordered Geraldine's favourite as some had reviewed that it was good and so was the homemade vanilla ice cream that came with it. It was very smooth and had vanilla seeds in them, and complemented the crépe very well. Initially, we found the caramel a little too sweet and by scraping off the excess caramel, made the sweetness level just right for us. Perhaps there could be an option for level of sweetness or to inform customers that they can request for the caramel to be served separately.The Crépe Suzette was more of a miss for us as it was a little uneven in terms of taste as some parts of the crepe had a strong citrus and sweet flavour while a corner had a very bitter taste.Regardless, we enjoyed the food so much that my brother and sister brought my mother the next day for lunch. Will definitely recommend to friends and to visit again
5
This creperie was a chance discovery while looking for wheat-free crepes. I ordered the roasted chicken crepe, and they were willing to adjust the preparation according to my request, without compromising on taste. The dessert (chocolate almond cake) was a treat. Definitely intending to go back again sometime soon for the great food and warm hospitality
4
Delicious, simple, unpretentious food, beautifully prepared. Loads of nice options, even for a fussy eater like me, and you have the option of buckwheat or normal flour for your crepes. The owner is lovely, and we had a nice chat since the restaurant was nearly empty the day we visited. It's a very small and cozy restaurant, we were lucky it wasn't full. I recommend you make a reservation to avoid disappointment as there are only some 10 tables or so. We had a great experience. The only reason I gave it a 4 stars is that my husband thought the glass of wine was a bit too small and the fact that they only accept cash. I just assumed they would take cards, as I imagine most people would do. It would be worth putting a sign outside to clarify it or informing people upon reservation to avoid any embarrassment.
5
My friend and I had a lovely meal at Entre-Nous. The ambience is nice and suitable for intimate gatherings. We found the food to be authentic, just like being in France. I would definitely go back there and it is quite unique to Singapore I think.One extra thing we were happy with was that my friend is Vegan and they adapted the order to suit her dietary requirements, which is very useful to know
5
Such a great treat to find this little Creperie! If you like a proper French Crepe then this is the place for you. We went as a group today and ordered crepes for the kids. When they refused to share with the adults we were forced to order extra and quickly realised why they were so reluctant. It was such an unexpected delight to find such authentic crepes in the centre of Singapore and in addition to the food being just right the coffee was great and the service was fantastic. We loved it so much we booked a table for Saturday lunch! Highly recommend
5
The few time I went for dinner there I felt like entering a Creperie in French Bretagne (the region were crepes are specialities in France). It is really authentic, with very good ingredients and nicely cooked.Quantities are large and Taste is good.Do take a glass of cider (brut, I would recommend) as it is marrying very well with the food.Service is really enjoyable, nice and quick.PErfect for a lunch/dinner with friends and family
4
the crepes served are really close to those served in brittany in france.
both savory (galette) and sweet (crepe) are yummy.
great variety of combination on the menu
A few french starters and a typical french apple cidar will make your meal highly enjoyable.
4
We go regularly to Entre Nous for savoury and sweet crepes; nice salad, dry Cider and goats cheese with honey starter. Geraldine and Stephan create a cozy atmosphere, with simple, but very good crepes. You will want to come back!
4
Was there for a quick meal before a watching a performance at drama centre. We enjoy the food very much.
4
A friend recently recommended this place for an office lunch and we were all very pleased with our orders. The crepes were perfectly cooked and made with high quality ingredients. Expect to pay around $35/pax with drinks and starters (express lunch set), but it's well worth it as a special treat. We'll definitely be back
5
If you want to taste the real thing, that's the place. Over the past 10 years, I've tried all around the region, from Hong Kong to Tokyo, from Bangkok to Jakarta... and there's nothing like Entre-Nous.When I need a taste of Brittany, that's always where we head... and my kid loves it too :
2
Staff was very friendly. Crepes have very little filling and are very expensive for not being filling.
5
I have been coming to Entre-nous for the past 4 or 5 years already and the quality is consistent. Every dish tastes fantastically and every friend I brought there has always been very satisfied.My only negativ point: the aircon is sometimes too strong, but we are used to it and bring a jumper or a scarf ;) and some people like i
4
I had not visited this restaurant in a long time, and was surprised to see so many bad reviews of it recently! We went at 830pm on a Thursday evening and apart from our table of 4, there was only 1 other table of 2. The service, as you can imagine, was therefore very quick and attentive. Food-wise, I only really eat 1 thing there - the salted caramel crepe. It was still fantastic. Their salted caramel sauce is a beautiful balance of sweet, salty, and creamy. Have it on a plain crepe to fully appreciate its flavour.
5
My husband and I love the crepes and the coffee here, but everything on the menu has been wonderful so far. The atmosphere is relaxing and the service is great. The butter sugar crepe and nutella crepe are our favorite so far, they're so simple yet absolutely magical!
5
My wife Mei Ann and I love food and live to eat. We are extremely pleased we found this little restaurant. Nicely quiet, unpretentious, very clean and comfortable. We love the crepes here! And very considerate service as well. Wish we had our children with us, we would have been so happy eating here together.We will definitely visit Creperie Entre-Nous again :
5
Great crepes and fantastically friendly service. Try the avocado mashed with cream and garlic galette and the salted butter caramel crepe!
5
It was my first time dining in Entre-nous. My sister recommended this place. I must say I really enjoyed my lunch. The Avocado mashed with cream and garlic,fresh prawns and tomatoes is a must try!
4
Best Crepes in Singapore! Both Savory and Sweet crepes are equally delicious. Friendly service, too.
5
It's tricky finding truly gluten free options in Singapore. This creperie does is best! Their buckwheat crepes - savoury and sweet - are to die for! We loved it. Worth every penny. The service is impeccable as well. We're going back in a week! :)
5
Visited this cosy and nice restaurant . The crepe is the best i had eaten. When back for the second times with friends and everyone love it. Will be my first choice for crepe.
5
I had an excellent sweet crepe at Entre-nous this morning. Geraldine's favorite - crepe filled with cooked apples and generously drizzled with salted caramel with a scoop of home-made vanilla ice-cream. The crepe was crispy at the edges and light, thin and soft in the middle. The salted caramel was perfect!Service was pleasant and friendly!I'll visit again soon
5
So when my sister and brother in law asked if i was happy with a crepe for lunch i'm glad that i said yes!These crepes were amazing and very tasty. My sister and i had the Hoedic crepe which consists of creamy spinach, goats cheese and bacon bits. My brother in law and his colleague had the La Ouessant which was egg, ham, cheese and creamy mushrooms. No meal in a creperie would be complete without a banana and nutella crepe for dessert!The service was excellent. A very reasonably priced restaurant with great food in a great location ;-
5
Ive been visiting this lil quaint restaurant for years. Its a quiet place that serves excellent french crepes with delicious salted caramel. Throw in a cup of apple cider.... my day would be complete. Must say their crepes are really light and its just diff. It must be the flour used. Bring a friend with you... n.u can try both sweet n savoury types that come in a set enough for 2. Love their vanilla bean ice cream and cooked apples. Hosts are wonderful and friendly.
5
Whilst visiting Singapore recently, we lunched at this little intimate eatery in Seah Street, after visiting the quite excellent MINT Toy Museum just next door. Our lunch of crepes was accompanied by two glasses of champagne, the crepes were excellent and the champagne went down a treat ! :-) The lady who served us was very warm and welcoming and very competent at bringing us our lunch promptly .. we enjoyed out luncheon visit to this intimate little eatery very much and the quality of the food was excellent. Also, the food was very reasonably priced and this was an added bonus. Thankyou ENTRE-NOUS for making our visit to your little establishment a highlight ! :-) :-) 10/10 all round :-
5
What I like about the place is the simple yet comfortable ambiance, which I find really charming. We had a hard time deciding which crepes to get as we wanted to try everything. We were not disappointed when the food arrived as it was really good. I had to order another one actually, and the service was so pleasant. Geraldine was so nice to give us recommendations to decide which to try from the menu. I'm going to be visiting this place more often for sure. :
5
We have been to this place on a Sunday and had a great time! The food is terrific especially the homemade caramel and the owners are very welcoming :)
We will definitely come back! Furthermore the location is very convenient between City Hall and Bugis.
4
Very nice creperie, just across Raffles Hotel.
You won't be disappointed with the Groix salted crepe and their great choice of desserts. You won't be disappointed with their cider either.
Keep up the good work
5
I went to Entre-Nous last week with a colleague. Had the galette Brehat ("complete") which was very tasteful. Service was quick and efficient. Excellent option for lunch
5
Lunch date with hubby ! Very welcoming team and the crepes are awesome ! We tried their French crepes with very tasty cider !
Will come back definitely !
Thank you
5
Loved the freshly made crepes. It is light and satisfying lunch. Five of us ordered five different crepes and we all liked our choices. Because it was delicious and the relatively small size, we polished off our dishes very quickly. Five of us shared one dessert crepe (Nutella) and it was delicious. We agreed it was probably the best. With coffee, the bill came to about $150 but we got 30% discount from survival chic so we paid a total of $113 or about $22.5 per person. I will definitely go back for another meal with my husband on the weekend. They do have interesting specials on the menu and the interior of this place gives that warm and cozy feeling like we visit a friend's home.
5
I've always passed by this place to work however never go the chance to try and yesterday I finally had the chance to and I was not disappointed. The staff was very welcoming and made sure we were well attended to. The crepes where excellent to say the least... fresh, crispy, delicous... Definitely will be coming back again
5
We had an amazing time, eating french crêpe as if we where in France! I never thought I would have that kind of experience in Singapore, and each time I will feel homesick I now know where to go to give myself a nice treat :) Special ovation for the caramel crepe as a desert
5
Very nice! & Kawai ♡♡ restaurant.Service is also nice！!！Of course, Garrett is delicious.Three kinds of apple cider can also be chosen.It's being sold to homemade caramel sauce and mixture even in the restaurant.But the reproduction is difficult for the same taste by myself for galette.I felt this restaurant to be like small north France in Singapore.The galette is rare in Singapore.I found it from a Japanese blog on the Internet.I'd like to visit in brunch on a weekend.Thank you♡シンガポールで見つけた小さなフランス！日本人ブロガーさんの評価も高く、気になっていました。美味しいし、家族的な雰囲気も居心地よく、既に3回訪問しました
5
My friend and me went to Creperie Entre-Nous on 25th Oct 16 for dinner. This was our fist time dinning in this place. We were immediately attracted to the simple cosy, nice setting of the restaurant and friendly environment. There were a varieties of choice ranging from starter, soup, mains, desert and many others. As usual we couldn't decide what to eat so we asked for recommendation. The lady boss was extremely patient in explaining to us and make some proposals for the both of us. The turnout was excellent we love the crepes and in no time leaving the plates dry and empty.I would strongly recommend this place to another for a good satisfactory meals, chilling with frens, take a good break to please yourself with good food
4
We've eaten here four or five times and the food, service and waiting time has always been great and consistent. Tasty and wholesome and they even made provisions to leave out garlic and onions which we are allergic to. A place our family will revisit again
5
Excellent creperie. I had a lovely pre-show dinner. Extremely warm and personable service and really yummy food! We had the duck rilette, 2 savoury galettes and the salted butter caramel dessert crepe to finish. Everything was delicious!
4
Met my sister here for lunch; we ordered a French Onion Soup, and both a savory and sweet Geraldine's Favorite crepe. It's a little pricey, but the food's great, and the service is attentive and genuine. Will definitely be back :)
5
We ate here twice in two days, because the food was so good. It was a pleasure to find a restaurant in Singapore that understood gluten free, and made amazing food too!Delicious food at a good price with great service. If you're Coeliac or gluten intolerant don't miss it. Even if you aren't, do yourself a favour and eat here
5
Found this crepe cafe from Chope and choose this for a light lunch before watching a show nearby. Was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the crepes and service provided. The lady who served us provided great suggestions and we were happy with the choices finally made. We chose a savory crepe with cheese, ham and egg and I must say that was that best I have ate so far. The edges were crispy and lightly brown while the center was soft and tender with the sunny side egg. The flavours were well balance and unforgettable. We also chose a sweet crepe with homemade ginger ice cream and chocolate sauce, which was sweet ending to a wonderful lunch
5
So glad to have found this little gem in the Bras Basah area. The traditional savoury crepes are made with buckwheat flour so it was ideal for me with gluten intolerance. Save room for dessert as the sweet offerings are not to be missed, I had the cooked apple with home made vanilla ice cream and salted butter caramel, which they also sell by the jar. Though deceptively simple looking, the flavours are powerful and totally addictive
5
La Crêperie Entre-Nous reminds me of our holidays in Brittany long time ago and is one of my favorite eateries when I am in the Bras Basah area. The savory galettes are crispy and very tasty and the home made Caramel au Beurre Salé in the sweet crêpes is just to dream of..
5
I've been going to Entre-Nous for years and it is one of my favourite restaurants in the city. The crepes are crispy, the flour itself is tasty (a real slice of Brittany in Singapore), there are a lot of combinations available, the ingredients are fresh... All served with refreshing sweet or dry (my preference) cider. Special mention for the homemade salted caramel, which you can have with a sweet crepe or possibly one of the desserts of the day
4
The location has a French traditionnal creperie feel. You have choice of different French cider you drink in the traditionnal cup.There are a large choice of galettes & crepes, with many possibilities for vegetarian. The avocado cream / tomatoes is nice for example. The sweet ones are good too : we tried the classic salted butter caramel and chesnut purée.Taking 1 savory galette + 1 sweet crepe + cider would cost about 35-40sgd per person. Good deal
5
If you are Breton like me and you miss the taste of home, this is the place to go!If you are not Breton and you want the real taste of a Breton crêpe, this is also the place to go!Stephane and Geraldine welcome you in a place that looks like home and smells like home ( I mean if you are from Brittany! ) and are super friendly.Most products like cider come from Brittany.Breton people if you are feeling blue, just go and resource yourself there!To any customers: the best crêpe in town!Please note that you can only pay in cash.Enjoy!!
4
Earlier this year, I was introduced to this place by a French colleague who (a) is quite critical about French food and (b) ensured me the crêpes taste authentically Bretagne. It did not disappoint.The crêperie is quite unassuming from the outside, behind the Raffles Hotel (taxi lobby) and nestled in between a famous chicken rice place and the Toy Museum. Perhaps that adds to its charm.The menu offers a wide variety of savory and sweet. I've seen patrons start with one, only to order one more in the end. The crêpes are delicate and crispy, yet filling (and still people order seconds!).Try the mashed avocado house speciality, the seafood prawn, or the shredded chicken fillings. For sweets, try anything from traditional apple cinnamon to the salted caramel versions. And have a cup of apple cider with them.That's what I tried so far. I'll be coming back for more
5
By far the best crêpes in Singapore! The buckwheat crêpes are amazing and so is the cider. Everything is exactly like in France! I definitely recommend this restaurant!
3
Came here for lunch this week and tried one of the vegetarian crepes with a small salad side. The food was good and the service friendly and efficient. Probably worth another visit.
5
Very nice customer attention and service for a perfect set of crêpes bretonnes!
The classics or specialties are exactly how it should be and easily compete with the best creperies in France.
The cider is very reasonnably priced and of great quality.
4
It was my first visit to Entre-Nous. Each of us had one of the savory galette and one sweet crêpe. Galette was very crispy on the outside! Not to mention their homemade caramel !! It was so tasty ! It was a simple but delicious dinner with friends! Don't forget to bring cash as they don't accept cards! ;
5
Cosy cafe with indoor air con and outdoor fresh air w comfortable sitting area. French onion soup is one of the best soup here, served with cheese. I love the coconut with maply syrup and salted caramel ice cream crepe, perfect combo of all my favourite 
2
My partner and I were looking forward to dining in here, but we were disappointed of the lack of service. Especially at the moment of payment, the waitress told us at last minute that they do not accept any cards. This is probably the only no-food-court restaurant that does not take cards in Singapore ! We had to rush finding an ATM machine. Plus, they started to tidy up the outdoor terrace whereas we were still seated, this gave us a feeling as if they just wanted to get rid of us. I wouldn't advice anyone to go there
5
We stopped off here today for lunch after going to the Raffles hotel for a Singapore Sling (food v expensive there). This restaurant is across the road from the Raffles and has a huge selection of crepes with various fillings. I had banana and Nutella In mine and was full all afternoon Many of the crepes can be made gluten free. It is also good value for money and portion sizes are a decent size.
5
I love this place! Being a big fan of French crepes, I was happy to discover this quaint little French creperie on Seah Street. The place had a very homely casual feel and the service was friendly and attentive. My family and I enjoyed a range of their sweet crepes and savoury galettes (La Ovessant, Stephan's favourite, La Batz, Geraldine's favourite and Stephan's favourite) as well as a number of the French classics (Duck rillettes, Toasted goat cheese and Honey, Escargots). There's so much I love that I wish I had more stomach space! Special mention to those with a sweet tooth.... their home made sea salt butter caramel is a definite winner. The vanilla ice-cream which I suspect is also home made was just right, smooth, rich and not too sweet. I can't wait to go back and try out more of their other crepes that caught my eyes
5
My family and I had an amazing meal here to celebrate my brother birthday. We were very satisfied with our dinner along with the attentive service provided. I am actually quite surprise to find a crepe shop that is as authentic as the one that i had back in France. There is a great varieties of crepe offered on the menu . We will defitenely be back for the crepe and also for the caramel.
5
I came here with my Fiancé a few evenings ago and we had a really wonderful meal. I am European and he is Singaporean and I was surprised and overjoyed to find such authentic french food here! We both thought that the food was delicious, we had the crêpes bretonnes followed by a sweet crêpe (with stewed apples, salted caramel and icecream!) for dessert. To accompany our meal we both had the cidre which was also very good. Service was excellent, very attentive, and the atmosphere was really nice, almost felt like being back in Brittany. We will definitely be coming back, especially as the prices were very reasonable and it seems that they have good weekly promotions as well
5
Excellent gluten free crepe, warm service, strong fragrant coffee, great display, delicious food served with a smile. Try the salted caramel!!
5
We went to Entre-Nous on a weekend evening. We all (4 pax) tried some appetisers and different crepes, and they were all very delicious. Service was fast and attentive. We would like to go back!
5
Went for a lazy Sunday lunch with friends. Great service, great, perfectly thin crispy crepes in a big choice of styles. Roquefort with walnuts is a great combination. And the salted caramel sauce is amazing
4
We had a really nice lunch experience at Entre-Nous. Knowing Crepes from the Bretagne FR I can assure that the crew exactly knows what their doing. Especially as they are most probably done by the owner (lovely french couple) themselves.
5
I was so excited even before I went. As a crepe fanatic, I go around life chasing for good crepes!My hubby and I shared one sweet and one savoury crepe. It was impressive! This crepe place uses a different batter for the sweet and savoury crepe, you gotta try both! I'm not a fan of savoury, but it was good enough for me to take a few extra bites. The sweet crepe was awesome, as good as expected. Could be a little crispier, but the taste and texture was just right. The strawberry ice cream seems homemade, worth a try though not as creamy as I wished it to be.The black coffee was pretty okay, but iced lemon tea couldn't make the cut. Do bring cash along if you're visiting, they don't accept cards, not even NETS
4
We ordered 2 savoury crêpes (Avo and tomatoes + Tomatoes, herbs, olive oil and an extra topping of emmental). Both were very nice and the crêpes thin and tasty, like I have had them in Brittany. The star was the sweet one, we had the simple pancake with salted caramel butter and one also with salted caramel butter but with additional cooked apples inside, as well as a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. The salted caramel butter was delicious and once again reminded me of what I had tried in France.The prices were reasonable. Two aspects that could be improved: the Salad of the Day ($14) was not that special, and I would have liked to have a small side salad with my crêpes, even if the one we had chosen were not the most fancy ones, which do come with a side salad.Otherwise, a very pleasant experience and a nice lunch. We will for sure be back for a taste of delicious 'crêpes bretonnes'
4
Cosy little joint that serves really delicious crepes. We had their set lunch and had the cream of tomato to start off with. The savoury crepe was really nice with the crepe crispy and super thin! Special mention to the salted caramel butter crepe that was really heavenly! I'm going to be back for sure!
4
Ordered two savoury crepes and one sweet crepe. The savoury crepe were very well done and authentic. Do not miss the salted butter caramel sweet crepes! Those were amazing! Service staff was friendly and helpful (and French!), and it was a v cosy and comfortable dining experience
5
Entre-nous is a lovely creperie in the heart of Singapore which offers sweet and salty gluten free pancakes and soup. The owner, a nice french lady was very helpful and guaranteed the food will not contain gluten. i tried both sweat and salty and also ate soup. I recommended all! Must try if you are cöliac in Singapore
4
Good authentic Bretagne (Brittany) galettes and crepes, both savoury and sweet. A bit pricey but hard to find this level of authenticity outside of France. Centrally located, but tucked away in a corner of Seah Street. We have been going there for years and our favorites savories are "Stephan's Favourite" (roasted chicken, wholegrain mustard and caramelized onions) and "La Ouessant" (Ham, emmental cheese, mushrooms, cream cheese and a perfect sunny side up egg in the centre). For dessert, the salted butter caramel crepe is to die for! Highly recommended!
5
They have authentic crepes in this very cozy place. We ordered Geraldine's Favourite and Stephan's Favourite both with homemade ice cream. So Good!
5
Would post a photo, but the food went to quickly!! Great sweet and savory crepes, and would also recommend the French onion soup.
5
This was a huge surprise, it was like I was back in France. Excellent, savory and sweet crepes. The only warning I have is they do not take credit card. Cash only. Almost was in big trouble.... Excellent place.
4
A real creperie from Bretagne. Small restaurant with nice crepes. The sweet crepes were very good. The galette was a bit too hard, but they taste fine.
5
Popped into this creperie during our recent visit. The apple with salted caramel and pear with ginger ice cream were delicious. Owner was friendly and spent time with customers. Will definitely return to try more😀
5
Brought a couple of friends to Creperie Entre-Nous for a weekday lunch. It was our first time there and it was a very enjoyable meal. We had a mixture of savoury and sweet crepes; all of them were delicious. The cider was also delightful. Am glad we paid a visit and I would be a return customer. Do bring cash though as the place only accepts cash. :
5
Bonjour! It was just a random hop in cafe adventure with my best buddy little did I knew this small cosy place serves one of the most unique taste of buckwheat crepes . It was really amazing and we really enjoyed our meal over and the atmosphere was just cosy, nice and very relax. Absolutely recommend this place to anyone else ;) oh I've got to say the salted caramel was really so different it wasn't too sweet just the right texture amount and we really love the ginger ice cream. The host was kind to share some good recommendations. Certainly, will be coming back more next time Bon appetite
5
i love their crepes both savoury and sweet, especialy the one with homemade salted caramel.we were celebrating my mother's birthday and they arrange to put a candle on her crepe.the service is very friendly, efficient and experienced.a guaranted place to be recommended to my friends and relatives
5
I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at entrenous. The host was prompt and friendly. She served me quickly when I said I was hungry. I ordered the duck rillettes which was a good starter. Followed by the roast chicken crepe, served with seeded mustard, a perfect accompaniment to my dry French cider. A sweet way to end with the chocolate crepe. Ooh la la. I'll be back for sure again! Merci!
5
Great little creperie tucked at the back of Raffles Hotel. Went with my daughter who is temporarily on a dairy free gluten free diet, and they were super accomodating. The buckwheat crepes are actually dairy free as well as gluten free, so you can choose your toppings accordingly as well if you are on a strict diet or just want to make health conscious choices. The flavour was really nice, service great and quick, we would definitely go back. By the way they have a lot of other choices if you want something other than just crepes
5
Love this place. Great food, friendly staff. Went 3 times in 3 days. If you're craving a bit of western food then definitely head here. Delicious!
5
My friend and I wanted to try crepes in Singapore and were not disapointed with Entree Nous. The food was great and the atmosphere at the resturant also nice.
5
Situated behind the Raffles hotel in a little side street well worth the visit for lunch. Very light crepes and an incredible choice of sweet and savory. Just go easy on the cider- it's stronger than you think!
5
The dessert crepes remind me of crepes I had tried back in France. Sweet and a good way to end a meal. Love their salted caramel sauce, wish I could buy back tons!

Inspired by Brittany, France’s northwestern-most region, the Creperie Entre-Nous offers buckwheat flour for gluten free intolerance or organic wheat flour, which is great for someone like me who is slightly allergic to wheat.A small cafe, it offers outdoor seating and an indoor area. Cozy, it feels authentic, intimate and friendly. And the French lady, whom I presume is the boss, was most pleasant as she served us. Though, the blue and white walls somehow made me feel like I was in Greek restaurant.To the food. We ordered a French Onion Soup to share, the missus had the signature La ouessant of Egg, ham, emmental cheese and mushrooms with cream sauce, while I opted for the L'ile aux moines made of Roquefort cheese , chives and roasted walnuts.The soup was tasty though I wished they would come in a bigger serving. For $11.90, it's not the most wallet-friendly. It was rather tasty though, and comes with side bowls of croutons and cheese for a DIY experience. It's slightly different from the gooey viscous melted cheese on top of the soup that I am more accustomed to seeing.While the La ouessant was delicious, the dough was rather hard and dry. The L'ile aux moines, on the other hand, was sublime. Rich blue cheese, slightly charred dough, and crunchy walnuts bits, it was a full, and fulfilling meal. If you are not a big fan of Roquefort cheese, this is not for you. When the dish was served, all eyes turned towards us; obviously the aroma led the way!All in all, a lovely dining experience and arguably one of the most crepes in town. But be prepared to pay for quality
4
I had a craving for french crepes, so we decided to have brunch in Entre-Nous.Food was very tasty!Coffee was very good.The environment is nice, wonderful view and friendly staff.On my opinion, its a very good option for breakfast or brunch in the town.Unfortunately, meals were too small and the Creperie did not accept credit card
4
as this Creperie is my daughter's favorite restaurant in Singapore, I will let her comment : "we almost go every Friday with my Mum to this Creperie, it is really yummy ! what I like the most is the Ham Crepe, with super good ham. I think the pastry of the galettes and the crepes is really good. each bite is a beautiful dream...even though the place looks a bit old, it is still nice with pictures of Bretagne.
5
I am craving sweet crepes but don't have any idea where to go in Singapore. So i check in the tripadvisor and there i knew entree nous. The crepes are really to die for especially my new love salted caramel crepes hehe. Definitely will be back again
5
This is the only crepe that I make time to eat every time I visit SG! The salted caramel crepe always satisfies and though it costs more to have it with a scoop of their vanilla ice cream, it's totally worth it. The place is cozy and comfortable- a wonderful spot if you desire a more quiet yet still classy hang out :) p/s I've seen other patrons praising their wine. It's not my thing though so I've not tried

Whenever i had cravings for crepe, this is the place i would go for dessert, be it sweet or savory!! both are good, love their signature dish!! esp for the salted caramel crepe~ :
4
We coming already for few years to this restaurant and still find it so good, favorites crêpes avocado and crêpes caramel beurre salé
4
If the crepes are served with more sauces, they will be excellent.
We attended the restaurant when it was about to be closed very soon for the afternoon session. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, we were warmly welcome.
4
Tried the savory and sweet ones, they were all excellent. Good service and location in the heart of the city. There was only one person serving (I assume she's the owner) so service was a bit long, but it was all right.
5
I haven't paid a visit to all creperies in Singapore but I am almost certain this one is the best.Crepes are just like in France and I will even say they taste like in Brittany. You have tons of options to choose from on the menu. You are spoilt for choice! Not to mention the French owners are extremely kind
5
This is a lovely little place just beside Raffles Hotel. Great when you're after a light dinner and something French. The crepes are tasty (I like the one with several cheeses - think it's called Geraldine's favourite) and they have both savoury and sweet. Service is efficient and friendly. They also have cider that pairs well with the crepes.
5
First stepped into this lovely, almost hidden creperie just next to the iconic Raffles Hotel a couple of years ago, and was immediately smitten with the crepes served here. Goat's cheese with honey on buckwheat crepe remains a firm favourite and an unmissable savory/sweet combination. Savory ones are good as well. Go with the ones that the owners love and you won't go wrong. Coffee here is good too
5
A small but well located authentic French creperie just opposite world famous Raffles hotel. Crepes are as good as in Brittany, from traditional to Asian fusion crepes with a friendly and efficient service of GÃ©raldine. Genuine French cider is also available by cup or bottle. Lastly, set menus makes it very affordable on weekdays. A must in Singapore if you want to taste the very best of the authentic crepes from Brittany
5
My family has eaten at this restaurant several times and we are always happy to go back. The crepes are delicious, like what we had when we lived in Paris. The people who run the restaurant are very nice and the service is attentive. A charming and authentic french experience in Singapore

One of my favorite street foods in Paris is buckwheat crepes. Unlike the sweet crepes most people know, buckwheat crepes are savory, originally coming from Brittany, where they are served with hard cider. They are typically filled with ham and Gruyere cheese. If you are looking for an authentic French food experience then the Creperie Entre-Nous is a good choice. The owner/founder couple that opened the joint are there cooking and serving meals exactly like I had in France. Their menu has expanded over the years and includes a great selection of both savory and sweet crepes, as well as starters, salads and, of course, French cider. Hot tip: Order the set meal which includes a starter, your choice of two kinds of crepes and coffee/tea. Tucked behind Raffles hotel on Seah Street

I went there with a group of friends and was disappointed by the price for what we got. Barely any mushrooms in the crepes. Quality is good but when you know the price of a crepe, they are making money on the back of their customers like mad! Service is a bit bland and they only take cash!! Not worth the visit! Moreover the selection is not authentic
4
I love it so much that I yearn for it all day long. it is one of my fav restaurants all time long. I love it for its taste and coffee smell it gives.
5
... In the heart of the city, no less!
I can't think of a restaurant that does similar quality crepes in Singapore. Loved the buckwheat crepes especially! Service was prompt and excellent, with the only (minor) drawback that they don't accept credit cards.
5
Nice welcome by lady owner
Service was quick an they know there stuff.
From Brittany
Cider was good too
If you look for solid good creperie
Should be the pkace
4
A little haven of Brittany, serving real Crepes in a city where it's easy to buy a poor copy of everything. Real Illy coffee too!
Don't be deterred by the slightly jaded exterior, its a great spot. Recommended.
5
The Crepes from Entre-Nous are delicious and authentic! A wonderful find in Singapore! For dessert I love any crepe with the homemade salted caramel sauce. Definitely a place to go to!
4
Came here for a cappuccino after lunch at Tess bar in the same street. Small cups of illy coffee, but pretty good. A little more expensive than you might expect at some of the standard chain stores, but hey. Tempted to come back some time to try the crepes
4
Food is delicious and homemade, service is quick and owners are nice. Not too crowded and you have the choice of eating inside or outsid.Again, food is amazing and during the week there are promotions. I also like it a lot because its a family restaurant so it's very welcoming
5
Looked for a gluten free restaurant in Singapore. Found Entre Nous. Arrived in what was not the swankiest little street to an empty restaurant. Things were not hopeful.How wrong we were.The food was amazing. Our one gluten free eater had the time of his life with the crepes and all the others in our party thought the food was superb. My wife enjoyed the scallops so much she reordered them for dessert! (and I can assure you she has never done that before). Service was friendly and helpful.Most highly recommended by all of the family
5
If you want to discover the real taste and warm spirit of the beautiful Brittany region in France, run to the Creperie Entre-Nous. The owners of the restaurant, who come from this region, are friendly and discret. The ambiance is simple and cosy, like any french creperie, perfect for a dinner with friends or a casual date. They propose a large variety of crepes to satisfy all the palates, and don't forget to pair your meal with a bottle of cider.Great time with great food and great people, it's as simple as that..
4
If you are looking for authentic Breton galettes, then Entre-Nous is the real deal. They even offer artisanal Breton apple cider! While the fare served here is simple, it is comfort food epitomized. And I didn't realize how high their standard was until I toured Brittany a couple of years ago, and found that Entre-Nous compared favourably against the best galette eateries I dined at there
4
Good choice of savory crepes - regular and buckwheat.
Sweet crepes are great too, especially with the salted caramel sauce.
5
From the moment you stepped in, was greeted warmly and the selection of crepes n drinks is large! We always love how consistently delicious the food and drinks there are and also introduce our friends to the chewy and yummy crepes!
5
Crepe was absolutely delicious and unlike other crepes I've ever tasted before. It was pretty quiet on a Thursday night :)!
4
The crepes are well done and yummy.
Both the savoury and dessert crepes were good.
It is not cheap considering what you are getting and they do not take credit cards
4
If you fancy good french crepes, this is the place to go! The galette with ham and cheese was just like we have in Brittany. Succulent!
5
The crepes here are better than those I had in other countries. The salted caramel crepe is a must. Great to have that for dessert after the savory buckwheat crepe. Always a satisfying meal. They only take cash though. So glad to have this restaurant in Singapore
5
Gluten Free is beyond difficult to find in Singapore. Most Singaporeans look at you blankly when you ask for gluten free food. However, we found this delightful restaurant today. The service is lovely, they had gluten free marked on the menu. The food is amazing and the price is ok too, around mid range
4
I was looking for a creperie in Singapore and I came across the good reviews for Entre-Nous on Trip Advisor. It is a cozy place and it is truly authentic when it comes to French crepes. I had a savory galette with ham and emmental cheese and it was delicious. The service was ok, nothing special and the price was average. I did not try their sweet crepes, but I would definitely go back there if I am in Singapore again. Entre-Nous is an authentic experience from Brittany in Singapore and I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a place to have crepes
4
Husband and wife restaurant, I came during lunch time with 9 friends and we ordered 9 different types of crepes. The husband is a one man chef doing all the dishes so it will a short while if you are in a big group. The best take away for me is the lemon sorbet! SUPER REFRESHING AFTER SO MANY CREPES.
5
Entre-Nous Creperie is a suitable place to enjoy casual French atmosphere. We enjoyed the cidre, galette and crepe sacre following Bretagne style so much. Le madame spoke elegant French, which made us feel like being in France. The quiche was also fantastic. Overall, Entre-Nous literally deserves the secret `between us`. Merci.
3
Crepes were v average & too pricey for is served. For a warm day, only 1 Aircon was turned on & the place was v stuffy & warm. Was not a pleasant lunch.
5
Amazingly good crepes. The savoury ones were delicious! If you like sweet crepes, go for the salted caramel one. It's very, very good. Worth every cent. Will be back.
3
if it's just for the crepes, i will definitely come back. i particularly enjoyed their galette savory crepe, tasty yet not overwhelming, and their dessert crepe. i didn't like the salad though - lacked variety and the greens is just limited to lettuce. the iced lemon tea is not refreshing.. the place needs to be dressed up a bit more for that authentic french creperie ambience. also the restroom needs to be cleaner... they don't accept credit cards so be sure to bring cash
5
I was surprised to stumble across such a cosy and authentic place so close to the Raffles Hotel, but entirely glad that I did! Entre-nous Crêperie is the real deal when it comes to French crepes, the savoury galettes, filled with a range of ingredients are absolutely delicious, my personal favourite was the Ham and Emmental. For dessert I had the Homemade Salted Butter Caramel crepe and it was to die for! Don’t miss the cider to wash it all down... An authentic experience from Brittany in Singapore, I would thoroughly recommend it
5
If you are craving the best and most authentic crepes and galettes in Singapore then this is it. Been here on weekends with kids, at lunch time solo and in the evenings and Entre is consistently scrumptious every time. If you are staying at the Raffles Hotel the cafe is across the street so go go go
5
As someone who has visited a lot of French creperies, I did not expect to find such a great creperie in the middle of Singapore. It appears to be run by 2 French natives from Brittany. I had a wonderful galette, some gorgeous Breton cidre doux and a chocolate crepe for dessert. All were prepared to the highest standards. I was very impressed and would happily recommend this creperie to others. Well done to the staff
4
I have been a regular at this place since it first opened. I would highly recommend the savory crepes/galettes - they are made with buckwheat floor and have this nutty, slightly bitter taste and are served piping hot. I like the versions with shredded chicken, onions and mustard and prawns with avocado. For dessert crepes, I would recommend the ones paired with the home made salted caramel, chestnut puree or coconut ice cream.It isn't cheap for what you get but then again they don't have any competitors in Singapore (especially with regard to the savoury crepes). They do have set meals during the weekends so go for those if available
5
First visit to this small French restaurant that specializes in French crepes! Many choices of fillings to choose from, each comes with a crisp crepe. We also thoroughly enjoyed the starter - Blinis - smoked salmon with caviar on 10 mini pancakes!Service was friendly and the place has a sort of blue-sea theme to it. Recommended place should you enjoy something different in Singapore
3
I was excited to try a true French creperie but I was a little bit disppointed. The service is nice, the place is ok (not too crowded when we came). However, it's quite expensive for two crepes you may pay more than 30 $ - really there is nothing exceptional in this creperie !
5
I have been coming to this outlet for quite some time and never been disappointed, even quite surprised to find this type of cuisine in Singapore.The pancakes are a dream, and kids love it; Salty or sweet, If you never try this , it will save you an expensive ride to French Brittany....where you usually find those..Their set lunch is good value for mone
5
I've been there during my holidays and it was so cool ;)
Welcome with a smily french girl, in a nice atmosphere. Plenty of choice in the menu.
Crepes are just delicious!
Great time and great food, highly recommanded ;)
5
Friendly, smily welcoming staff.
Quite good menu with large choice of crêpes, delicious and tasty, tender and crispy, sweet or salted (I had both... Yumi, yumi) in a very nice atmosphere.
No regret, no hesitation.

Creperie entre-nous is a tiny restaurant located next to the Mint toy museum, but look hard, as it is easy to miss despite its strategic location. Was I only too glad to have found it! The menu is extensive and they do have set lunches that are value for money too. I loved every bite of my salmon and creme fraiche and salted butter caramel crepes- they were thin, crispy and flavourful- just the way crepes should be. It left me craving for more
4
As a student in Europe more than 30 years ago, I used to eat a lot of crepes with diverse ingredients. Back to Singapore, I was there with my family for lunch today. Initially, we were taken aback by its simplicity and the unusual smell inside the bistro. But the food was almost as good as we could find in France, as a whole. The service by the young lady from Quimper was excellent
5
This lovely cute creperie next to the raffles hotel is a real find. The staff is amazing, it's very personal and the food is amazing, original from Bretagne, France. Some construction next door is really not good for the business I think but inside its great as always so can really recommend this restaurant. We cannot lose this creperie in Singapore. Reasonable prices and selections crepes (sweet and savory). Enjoy!!
5
Owned by a nice couple, this place is a traditional French Crêperie. The crêpes are very nice and very reasonably priced. A lot of choice! Even being a fan this speciality, I didn't find more than 5 better tasting galettes in French Brittany. If you like or want to discover galettes, this is the place.
4
It's been now many times we go with friends, or with colleagues and each time, it's perfect! There is a good menu, with a lot of choices, and good ciders!The location is not really beautiful but it's located in a quiet street, behind Raffles Hotel. It's ok to enjoy a very good "crepe". I recommend "La groix", very tasteful and for dessert you have to taste caramel salted butter... so frenchy! Don't hesitate and go to enjoy
2
I was excited to try a true French creperie and I have to admit that I was a little bit disapointed. The place is confined and to close from the kitchen that give a bad smell in the restaurant. The food was not up to my expectation, too little filling and not so well cook. Too overpriced for little value
5
This place is run by a young French couple who serves the best buckwheat crepes ever. I truly wished I had visited this place 4years ago, as I would have eaten here each time I was in town. Savory and sweet creeps to die for. Yum
5
Creperie Entre -Nous is easy to miss in Seah Street but if you like French Crepes do yourself a favour and pay them a visit. It's the genuine article and after a savory buckwheat crepe,French cider and the best creme brulee I have eaten I could almost have been back in France! Strongly recommende
