This place has some really good local hawker food. The Mee Pok and Curry Mee are two worth mentioning. I canâ€™t remember the name of the stalls, but you can tell they are good by the length of the queue.

We went here mainly for Tanglin Crispy Curry Puffs - found it eventually. This food centre was a bit difficult to find our way around in, but if you are just wandering around sampling the dishes that is not a problem. Cheap food, cheap beer.
5
This is one of the oldest hawker center you can find in the center. food cost an average of 3.50. I tried the bowl of minced meat noodles, its nice, and cheap and good. The owner cook the food with love and passion

We have visited a few times during our Singapore stay. We had the famous Ah Heng dish which had no line as we were there at 10:15am. We tried some other places too and value was excellent. Note that it is not very clean and has poor airflow throughout though.

Came to the Hong Lim Food Centre with a friend for lunch today. My first time here, despite having been in Singapore for more than 10 years now. It's not really the cleanest food court, but there's a good selection of hawker outlets and getting a place to sit isn't too difficult. Today we opted for some boiled fish with vegetables, and then had a coffee and a muffin. All quite ok, just a bit hot and not as clean as I would have liked. Prices are very reasonable

Hong Lim Food Centre is located at Upper Cross St and is just next to Chinatown Point. Take a train to Chinatown station and exit at Chinatown Point. A short walk brings you to Hong Lim Complex which houses the Food Centre. There are two levels of cooked food stalls selling Malay and Chinese food. Some of the hawkers have been here for the last 40 years and their culinary skill is second to none.The mee pok stall is famous for its fishball and fish cake. The chicken curry mee stall attracts a long queue during lunch time and you must be prepared to wait 15- 30 min for your bowl of chicken curry noodle. The min price is $5 per bowl. You get value for your money as there is ample mee, tau pok, fish cake and bean sprouts.  The peanut cake stall is on level 1 and each piece of cake costs $0.80. This food centre has some of the best stalls in Chinatown and for tourists a visit to this place is a must
4
Make a beeline for this place if you want a taste of local food, chicken rice, laksa, char kway teow and many more. Come here before the lunch crowd, if not be prepared to queue at many of the popular stalls and do not come here too late, many of the famous stalls have sold out their food and start packing up 3p
3
Due to the low ceiling of this hawker centre, ventilation is not fantastic but they have put in lots of fans to keep the place cool. Don't go the next day after they have their usual spring cleaning (probably once every 2 ~ 3 months) as the tables and chairs are terribly dirty. You still can get a decent cheap meal here. Some of the stalls operate from 6.30am onwards
5
Stayed at ParkRoyal Hotel at Pickering Street and Hong Lim Food Center is the place to head to for access local food. Good time to head there is before and after the lunch crowd. Outram Park Fried Kwey Teow Mee on the 2nd floor is my favorite stal
5
This place warrants multiple visits. It's no frills eating but there are lots of quality stalls depending on what you fancy.I like the duck rice next to the famous Outram road char kway teow, the Kong spare rib rice (2nd flr), glutinous rice dumplings with belly pork (2nd floor), Crayfish and prawn hor fun, yong tau foo (1st floor).Tip: get there early. Lunch crowd from 12pmTip: Chinatown station is nearest MRTTip: if you are on your own, you can leave a packet of tissue on a seat. Others will understand that the seat is reserved while you queue for your food. (This common practice is for hawker centres not restaurants
4
We made the trip to try the prawn Noddle (Owner called Ah Hui) located at the second floor next to a coffee drink stall. Recommended by a friend. 3rd generation family own. Definitely outstanding. Worth going
4
Curry chicken noodles on 2nd flr is good. Fish soup bee hoon on ground floor is better. Fish ball (handmake) on ground floor second lane is best!
4
There are numerous stalls selling authentic hawker food as well as a wet market in Hong Lim Complex. The nearest MRT station is Chinatown, accessible via the NEL and the Downtown lines.

Hawker centers are the place to go when in Singapore if one does not mind Dai Pai Dong style (borrowing analogy from Hong Kong) food stalls. Most hawker centers are semi-open air, meaning they have roofs on top of the complex but the whole structure are not enclosed, without A/C and just lots of fans (and perhaps some swamp coolers) in summertime with the heat and humidity it can be brutal eating at the hawker center.However if you love food, hawker centers are the place to be in Singapore.This Hong Lim is closest to our hotel: Furama City Center. Authentic, cheap, good and over 100 stalls spread out through couple floors.Here you can find pretty much all the Singaporean favorites: laksa, curry, toasts with eggs/kopi; Chinese, Malays, Teochew, Indian, Indonesian, Hokkien, pretty much most SE Asian foods are represented here
5
Whoa, this is must have visit spot every time I go to Singapore.A Heng Chicken Curry @ 2nd floor is a must.At the corner on the 1'st floor, there is Barcook Bakery. You need to try this one. The bread is very good. I love the ham and egg bread, the mixed berry bread, the Hawaiian Pizza Bread. Almost all bread is good.And in front of this bakery, ther is fruit stall. In several occasion I got durian, good taste and relatively cheap
3
I tried 1) Ah Kow Bak Chor Mee (BCM) Pok which is operated by TeoChew people and 2) Ah Heng Curry Laksa with Hainanese Chicken and 3) fresh jackfruits. 1 & 2 are both recommended in the Singapore Michelin guide. I am a fan of BCM but since I don't live in Singapore and you cannot get it elsewhere outside of Singapore, I thought the BCM was quite good but not to my preferred taste. I must put it down to the strong vinegary smell and taste to it and the lack of the special chilli for BCM and the pork lard crispy. For the Ah Heng Curry Laksa, it was good but wish they would also add the long beans, some cuttlefish, some mint leaves, some cockles, some pig blood curd, some bean sprouts...but haha, someone said that would then make the noodle a Penang curry laksa. Later I noticed that this is actually a chain stall as Ah Heng is also at another CBD area food court
5
Hong Lim is right outside the Chinatown Point Complex and quite convenient to the MRT (Downtown and NorthEast lines). The stalls that I like are for Kuew Teow (I believe it's called Outram) and a Sungei Road outlet ( not the same as the Sungei Road Laksa near Jalan Besar) that specializes in laksa. But I think the mee Siam and the mee rebus are both excellent
4
I had made this trip just to try out Curry Chicken Noodles, Heng Kee and Ah Heng. I tried both the stalls' curry noodles and each had their own flavors. Heng Kee's chilli and curry has a heavier tone while Ah Heng is lighter on the taste buds. Both stalls are catered for different taste preference and there is no scale for comparison.I tried both and like both
4
This is a hot favourite place for most locals. Plenty of local and cheap eats. Have tried the bak chor noole and curry noodle & kway chup on 2nd level, are all great, My favourite is still the chicken curry noodle.See lots of people q-ing for the char kway teow, shall try that out when am there next time
5
This is one of my favourite food courts. I go there for lunch almost every week. You can try a good variety of very delicious local dishes such as Outram Park Fried Kway Teow, Crayfish and Prawn Hor Fun, Curry Chicken Noodles, Prawn Mee, Bak Chor Mee, Wanton Mee, Sungei Road Laksa, Roasted Meats with rice or noodles, Rice Dumplings, Muffins, etc. The location is very central. You can easily go there by MRT or buses. For those who drive, there is a multi-storey car park behind
4
This small hawker centre have a few good and authentic local food stores.
My Favourite is the curry chicken noodles and pork rib soup.
4
Went there for the curry chicken noodle. Order yellow noodle and yellow+mee hoon. The curry is light but taste good. The chicken meat is tender.
4
It seems weird for a local to leave a review but this is definitely one of the best place to get nice local foods. Duck rice, curry noodles, bak chor mee, fried kway teow. There is a fishsoup stall which alot of guys have missed out. Its called jin hua and its between the bak chor mee and the stall selling rice dumpling which is nice too. Hope i get the name right.
4
Crayfish & Prawn Hor Fun. It's the only reason I come to this hawker center, and I've been enjoying it for 6 years, even when it moved temporarily during complex renovations. By the way, it's now $8, and usually barely enough to satiate, so not your cheapest hawker meal. Fresh seafood, peeled/cut for ease of eating. The noodles in gravy are awesome; the chilli sauce is tangy and cuts through the thick gravy. The chilli is the only thing that changes over time, is inconsistent, and not always to my liking. The fried onions in the gravy are delectable. I can drink the gravy like soup. Go early. Line around the corner after 12pm.
5
there are so many choices - 2 stand outs, Outram Park Fried Kway Teow, and Tai Wah Miced Pork Noodles, both are excellent! one is run by a 70 year old Uncle who has been doing this for more than 30 years, the fried kway teow is moist, eggy, and if you love cockles - fresh and yummy (he opens early at 6am and is not open on Sundays)! Tai Wah is the brother of the Michelin star winner, the lines are a little shorter, but I think the noodles are equally good. Love this place
4
This food court is under a residential housing area.There is a wet market on the ground floor and cooked food stalls on the ground and first floors.Many of the local food venues have been penetrated by mainland Chinese migrants.Here there are older local stall owners who prepare and cooked the food and u are able to taste the "difference"Some of these stalls were featured in local tv food programs or in newspaper as they kept the local or should I say, bringing back the good memory of yesteryears when I was a young kid.The chicken rice stall, nasi Lemak , bak chor noodles , fried kway teow with cockles and Lard, rice dumplings or bak Chang, vegetarian food, curry laksa, bah kut teh, soy duck , fish ball noodles, fish soup are so tempting u want to order them all! There is no air conditioning so it may be a sweaty affair , u can cool down with the fresh fruit juices , sugar cane , barley or even lemon which is of abundance here too.I never miss a visit when I am in town...Many of the other famous food courts are popular amongst the tourists however they have some how lost their local flavor due to migrants manning the stalls
4
Hong Lim complex is another honourable place to find good local food, but if you don't like the crowd, avoid lunch hours cos it's crazy and you can hardly find a place to sit down. Some of the all time fav local food are Prawn noodle, curry chicken noodle, Teochew noodle, vegetarian food. Not to be missed Braised duck rice, together with the assortment of side orders they are offering. Must eat, not try
4
It may not as popular as Maxwell Food Center to the tourist. But you could find less people and more local dishes here. Ah Heng Curry Chicken Bee Hoon Mee (#02-57-58) - Long queue still appeared when I arrived in around 9pm. quite an interesting combination of having both vermicelli and noodle together with curry chicken
4
This is an amazing place to hunt for cheap and delicious local Singaporean food. You can get a decent meal for as low as SGD2.50. Lots of varieties available but do visit before 12 noon as the lunch time crowd is huge. Do try the stalls with a queue building up or stalls that occupy two stall fronts - these are good indications that the food is tasty
4
This is a very typical "old" local hawker centre where good food is abundant. It is not very big & is one of 3 Local hawker ( food) centres in Chinatown. Other bigger one is at nearby Chinatown Complex & a mid size one at People's Park Complex.This food centre is just adjacent to Chinatown Point Mall. There are also many shops within this food centre too. Many sells traditional Chinese products.It is not uncommon to find some stalls in most hawker centres proclaiming their 'Famous' status.One might notice however that the long queues may not necessarily be at the 'Famous' stalls.A logical guide to finding good local food would be those stalls with long queues. Not those with the 'Famous' title. But taste buds are subjective. Be adventurous & just try what you think looks good. Definitely there are quite a number of very good food here. So come with an empty stomach to try as many as possible.Take note stalls at hawker centres are usually closed once a week, the actual day depends on the stall owners. Normally Mondays has more closures
5
A worthy rival to the more famous sibling Bullock Cart Complex. This does not attract the tourists but mostly the CBD office crowd. Very wide range of delicacies but quiet over weekends. Try Tai Wah ' s Teochew noodles.
4
The food court in Hong Lim Complex, have many famous delight local food, you should go and try seem every stall with the long queuing is good food one.
5
Absolutely fantastic options at great prices with friendly people. Not necessarily the cleanest place to eat but definitely worth it if you're not fussy.
4
- two storeys of local delicacies connected by walkways to Chinatown Point and China Square
- chicken rice / braised duck rice are popular here
- a good alternative to Maxwell Food Centre
5
Hong Lim food centre is where good food is around. It's a 2-storey hawker centre, Outram Park Char Kway Teow is local delight, you would find a long queue. It's opened daily except for Sunday. Around the corner, there is a stall with good curry chicken noodles. Braised duck rice is good too. Just alight at Chinatown mrt and it is just behind Chinatown Point. Would come over to find food whenever I feel the craving
4
If you're looking for old school style hawker food under one roof, then this long established stalwart of the hawker food scene has to be visited- great location, a stone's throw from the Chinatown district with its quaint & traditional retail units housed in magnificent colonial buildings. But be prepared to queue for the food in some of the more popular stalls during lunch hour. Highlights include the char kuay teow & the porky noodles on level B
5
Hong Lim Complex hawker centre is a popular place for locals because they know what the best hiding.Try the Outram Park fried kway Teo but at any time you need to wait behind 25 customers. It is always the longest queue in the hawker centre. Not far away, the curry puff is made at the site and delicious. Truly Singapore style. If you can wake up early, try the Bak Ku Teh( Pork sparerib soup) on the ground floor. It is a dark coloured type, a Hokieen type nicely made soup. It is only open in the morning. I highly recommend.Although it does not look as clean as the other air-conditioned food court, it should be hygienic enough to eat there
3
Not far from Chinatown, we can also find Hong Lim Complex. Maybe it is not as famous as Chintown for tourist, but the food option is also vary with competitive price.Please be patient and pick your option slowly as you will find so many food kiosk in 1st level and 2nd level as well.Taste wise is not the best but definitely value for mone

The Hong Lim Complex has a famous food centre which is near to the Park Royal on Pickering Hotel . This famous food centre serves Chinese, Malay and Indian food. The stalls have been operating for more than 20 years and the quality of the food is excellent. I like the fish ball noodle and the Chinese pancake which has a peanut filling.The food is good and cheap.The famous fishball sells noodle with fishball made from wolf herring or xi dao yu. This is perhaps the best fish ball in Singapore, as good as if not better than the ones sold in Yong Peng town in Johor.The Chinese peanut cake costs 80cents per piece and the kueh has a crunchy taste. Die die must try. The Lor Mee stall is also excellent as the gravy is thick and tasty. Hong Lim Food Centre has about 50 stalls selling very good local food. Every day you see thousands of office workers coming here for their lunch and dinner. The food centre is closed on two days each month for washing and cleaning to ensure a clean environment for diners

This is possibly I daresay the best hawker centre in Singapore. Fantastic array of local food to choose from.Must trys include:Curry Chicken NoodlesBoth stalls on ground and second floor are good. I usually request to have mine without beansprouts which I felt alters the taste of the curry.Outram Char Kway TeowIf Hillstreet Char Kway Teow is number one, this is a close second. Perpetual long queue but worth the wait.Tai Hwa Bak Chor MeeA second best to Hillsteet Bak Chor Mee. Ingredients and serving style is exactly the same as Hillstreet. Word has it they are related. Expect to queue.Braised Duck/Kway ChapThere are two popular stalls on second floor. I personally prefer Ah Heng which is at the front row. Have the braised duck which Ah Heng is famous for, the pig innards and a bowl of rice drizzled with their fragrant sauce. Teochew PorridgeIt's on the ground floor at the back row. Comfort food for many.There are so many more good stalls it will be a shame to not sample some when you are in the vicinity.
4
Very near and convenience from center of Chinatown. There's many various food you can choose. I bought the promotion tickets of Univelsal Studio and other interested place/ activities here.
4
A beautiful place to find good eats and enjoy the piece of the local culture. Never fail me each time I go to the place to enjoy a nice lunch or dinner
4
This food center is popular for its curry chicken mee but there are number of cheap and delicious food to try if that is your first time visiting Singapore. You will be spoilt for choice on what to eat!
4
Went here a couple of times during our 2 week holiday in Singapore. All the food we tried was excellent.
5
This was my first taste of a Singaporean Hawkers market, and when I walked out of the shopping centre into this alleyway I must admit that I was instantly hooked. These places are nothing short of awesome. The juice stalls are particularly enticing, offering fruit drinks that you could never even dream of elsewhere (such as mango and dragon fruit, or watermelon â€“ I drank a lot of watermelon, if only for the fact that you simply don't get it back in Australia â€“ the juice that is, not the fruit). Okay, this place is nowhere near as big as some of the other hawker's markets, but it still has a decent selection of stalls where you can buy a whole variety of food as well as numerous drinks. These places are definitely worth checking out if you are in Singapore
4
It's a massive complex and completely packed out during lunchtime. Get there early to avoid the big queues. I ordered the fish balls and meat balls from hong xing and waited approximately 15 mins in line. Well worth it though, fish balls were bouncy and the soup broth had a lot of flavour and seasoned well. The dish came with dry noodles which was delicious. Looked like lard was used for the sauce which added a fragrant taste
3
This is one of 2 main food centres in Chinatown area for local food at reasonable prices.There are few nice good food stalls here; though limited & not as many as Chinatown complex food centre. And this place is so much smaller than Chinatown complex. The Curry chicken noodle on ground floor always have long queues. So is the Homemade fishball noodles on 2nd floor. Have tried both & they are nice. There is a stall that sells muffins of many different flavours, egg tarts, etc. Not bad.However if you want much more choices/more varieties & very good food too- then head to nearby Chinatown complex as it is a bigger & better place. We prefer Chinatown complex food centre. There is also a wet market there where you can get cheap fruits & fresh/raw food too
5
Stall 40 level 2 in the complex is tuck kee ipoh sah Hor fun is the full name but all you need to know is amazing crayfish with ipoh noodles.Only the locals know about this place and it is the real deal hawker stall and is not a restaurant. The other stalls are also great. Hint for tourists is choose the longest queue and you find the best food
4
Located in Chinatown, they have a good variety of food selection. From toasts bread, to laksa, to hokien mee and even slice fruits. You can have a meal for $5, drinks included. Which is pretty cheap for Singapore. they have 2 levels of hawker goodness. and right in front are small shops where you can purchase dried goods, stationary and herbal tea stuff. It is also near Chinatown MRT and a walking distance away to China Square if you want some night scene
4
Several pretty good food stores. Conveniently located behind Chinatown Point which is accessible by mrt NEL and Downtown line Chinatown station. There are 2 storeys - 2nd storey has more food stalls. Miss this lunch place after my workplace shifted to Alexandra. Recommended on 2nd storey are:1) Crayfish hor fun / noodle2) Seafood / fish soup with rice or noodles3) Dumpling (nonya and pork)4) Fishball noodle 5) Laksa / Fruit juice mee siam 6) Char kway tiao7) Bittergourd fish soup8) Peanut / Coconut / Redbean pancake (think it's named My Granny)9) Muffin / Cheese tart10) Tapioca cake / Sweet potato balls (handmade. name - Ah Meng)11) Curry noodles (at far end) Recommended on 1st storey:1) Fresh or Fried Fish soup (corner stall)2) Congee3) Tze Char (open only in evenings)4) Bak kut the / pig trotters5) Teochew porridge6) Another Curry noodles (same end as the Curry noodles on the 2nd storey, next to stairways)7) Sotong and mince meat balls soup (handmade)With so many good food stalls in this one location alone, I think non good-food stalls can hardly survive here. The only thing to lament is it can get a little hot and it is crowded during lunch hours. When it comes to dinner time, more than 3/4 of the stalls here are closed. So the better time to visit on weekdays could be before noon and after 1.30pm
3
Love the Bak Chor Mee, Wanton Mee and Big Prawn Noodles!
5
Try it you will like it. They have a prawn thing a lot of people had it for lunch, Yum
4
There are so many stalls here and price is very reasonable. Don't miss the curry chicken noodles on ground floor and the fish soup on 2nd floor. Of course, many many more...almost a 5 star rating!
4
Great variety of good local food
1
bad experience, some stall owner services totally dissatisfied, due to listen wrongly the price, I'm getting scolded by the stall owner, so disappointed to give 1 star. strongly and recommend my friends not come to this place cause your day will spoiled if you are unlucky choosing the "angry" stall
5
Hong Lim is located just behind the Chinatown Point Shopping Mall and can be reached, oddly enough, by getting off the NorthEast (purple) MRT line and following the signs. There are two stalls in particular that are excellent. The char kuey teow at the Outram Park stall is excellent quite possibly the best in all of Singapore. There's another stall just at the top of the stairway on the 2nd floor and I apologize for not knowing the name. The dish they are famous for is mee siam with a fruit juice gravy. That's really good, but for my money, the mee rebus is the dish people should line up for. For me, it's a tossup whether this mee rebus is the best in Singapore or if the mee rebus in the Kovan food center is better
4
If you are game for curry noodles (Chinese version) you must come to this hawker center for something out of this world. There are 2 stores here, the one on level 1 closes early. No later than 3 pm or when everything is sold out before that. There's another that operate till late at around 8 pm which is just as good. You make your choice.
4
Today I came to the food centre for the second time just because to look for the best Singapore char Kway Teow. Oh... It is unbelievable tasty. The overall flavor is well balance. The stall owner as well as the chef is a friendly gentleman. His motto in cooking is "must use your passion and courage". This is very a Singaorean spirit
5
There are several hawker stalls in Hong Lim that are famous, and can be easily identified by the long queues of people patronising those stalls. Some of my favorite stalls are the Outram Park Fried Kway Teow stall, the 168 traditional Lor Mee (noodles with braised meat sauce) stall
4
This place housed some of the famous local gawker fare like the curry chicken noodles, fried Kway teow, fish ball noodles and bah cho mee, and many many more. However during lunch hour on weekdays, this place is filled with people from offices located nearby and can be difficult to find seats. I would advise to come early like maybe 11am to avoid the crowd
