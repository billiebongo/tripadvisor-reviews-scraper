The atmosphere was great but recently the weather is slightly warm therefore advisable to sit indoor instead of outdoor. Food was great. Service was good too..

very new concept that i never thought i'd see. The whole menu is different with some minor similarities to the rest of the world. A must-try

I love the view here as it is by the sea. The ambience is so quiet and it allow us to eat at peace. Not those typical busy dinner kinda setting n I love it a lot. The angel hair pasta n truffle fries is really delicious. Staffs are really attentive too. I will defiybe back again.

Do not go to this place if you are looking for good/tasty food.. Don't be fool by google review.. B'cos all the good review is about the place with seaview *rolleye* The food LOOKS good.. just the looks.. utterly disgusted when I saw the cooks/chef arranging the cooked food with tongs and bare hand. In order to make the dishes looks nice, hygiene are secondary. They should brush up in terms of their food tasting rather than food appearance...

Food and service were good, and came with a special gift for the Mom in the group as it was during the Mother's Day weekend. Portions were a tad small for the price though. The only unpleasant bit was that we were told firmly--but nonetheless told off--that if we were to chope, we can't make use of other partner discounts, which were not made known to us at the point of making reservation.

It's my first time supporting this business, environment looks nice, so is the table settings, cool breeze with sea view. I tried the following - angel hair $$11, duck leg confit $25, pork ribs $28 and pork belly $15. I must say I really enjoyed the food especially the pork belly and also the duck confit which was served with pumpkin puree and sautÃ©ed mushrooms.My experience was almost perfect till the service totally turned me off. The Chinese male host totally spoilt my dining experience. I was told the following1. We do not serve chilli sauce for main courses, only for appetisers2. Because u are using a promotion, u r suppose to order everything at one go so you are not allowed to order dessert nowThe 1st incident was already ridiculous enuff but I accepted it. It's really about how the male server put it across, almost had this feeling he is sarcastically hinting do I know how to eat French food? But like I say I did not insist. The 2nd incident was too much, I ranted and mentioned it was never stated in any T&C and moreover it is such a ridiculous explaination. I gave up on the dessert order and asked for the bill, also requested the name of the chef. The rude male server came back, shoved the bill wallet to my table and waited for me to sign with zero attempts to furnish me what I asked for. But I can't be bothered anymore, signed the bill and left. I must say I like the food but I guess I'm not the target clientele they looking for and hence the discrimination in service standards and weird house rules. Enough said, I will not return again, no matter how good the food it.

1st visit to this ulu place but heard its worth the drive ... Indeed !Was kiasu, book using restaurant app a table at Horizon Bistronomy first in case all the restaurants are too crowded and long Q. Arrived at 515pm and checked out all the dining options. Two-storey building next to the sea and F&B outlets in a straight row. Seafood & crab restaurant luring custosmers who walked past with 30-40 per cent discount. After recee, we decided on Horizon Bistronomy and was given an Al Fresco table next to Fur Kicks which we did not fancy as Fur Kicks was blasting music away, too loud for our girly catch up. Requested to change to Table 2 which is great. Food was served fairly fast and service very efficient. NO free water was served. Tried a few signature dishes that i read rave review online and they truly did not disappoint ! Overall, great French dining over sunset & sea view.TIPS** ask for table 2 corner table for 4 pax al fresco, great sunset & sea view* must order dishes per photos * go early 530pm to enjoy transistion of day to sunset to night scenaryENJOY !

The food here is French cuisine and like all French food, you can taste but you cannot get full!We ordered all their signature dishes like Angel Hair Crab meat, Beef Cheek, Duo Pork, Pork Rips, Gargen By the Bay and Lava cake.Everything is tasty, but the mushroom soup was a bit disappointed, as too watery.Service is good as they teach you how to eat the Duo Pork, explained their house wine and recommending their signature dishesOverall good place to chill out and nice atmosphere

had dinner for 4 at punggol settlement, 2 weeks ago. the menu is small & simple, so we asked for recommendation from 1 of the owner, Mr Gian Long. he recommended us a Dou of pork (extremely good for meat lover like me), egg duet (english version of our traditional half boiled egg, my partner loves it). A paella (squid ink style, it's delicious unless u dw to "black" your mouth). and the crab meat angel hair (starters, small portion but its perfectly done, i suggest 2-3 portion for table of 4)it's a good dinner place to dine but the price is slightly on the high side
