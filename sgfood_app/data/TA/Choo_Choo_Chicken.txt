The fried chicken here are ok. There are a few flavours to choose from.
I personally prefer the soya sauce chicken.
Prices are affordable.

I went to SG for a Korean boyband concert so a day before the concert, my Singaporean friend asked me to enjoy a Korean taste food.
the atmosphere is great, chicken is great, price is good.

for who crazy with chicken, Cho Cho Chicken must try (similar like Chir Chir Chicken) but not all foods from chicken, generally not bad

Love the chicken tenders! Can't really taste the soy garlic flavour for the wings/drumlettes as it's not strongly marinated but the chicken wings are still yummy.

We decided to try Choo Choo's Garlic Chicken & Bucket of 8. Both were great for a late supper just before the little restaurant closed at 11pm. Very modest little place but food was fast & good

Went in, ordered the crispy tender chicken, simply loved the boneless chicken fillets in spicy flavour. The fillets were tender and succulent and we had an enjoyable time savouring the crispness while the spiciness did grow with each additional piece that we ate. Then we feasted on the cc burger, featuring thick layers of kimchi and tuna that are sandwiched between two patties of seaweed laced rice. Filling and flavourful

Went to Bali Lane on a Sunday and tried Choo Choo chicken. Very few people eating so it felt quiet and love the Kpop background music :) The chicken are just so-so. If there are other choices maybe I would opt for it as their food is quite more expensive but taste is average. Utensils used may also be improved to make it more appealing

One of many Korean fried chicken restaurants in Singapore. We had the honey soy flavor and the spicy fried chicken (the spicy was hotter than a lot of buffalo wings out there). Both were quite good. The flavored rice, with seaweed mixed inside, was also quite delicious. Fried chicken at a reasonable price, really not bad at all.

I went to the outlet in Toa Payoh Central on a Monday lunch around 1245pm with a friend. No lunch crowd which I like. I guess people go for the chicken but I didn't try out as I wanted ramen for lunch and that was new on menu. It costs S$8.90+ for a bowl of instant noodles with an egg, luncheon meat and sliced rice cakes. It also came with chopped Kimchi as a side dish. Expensive lunch considered for what I eat but it's a nice quiet place with air con. The ramen is a little soggy. I decided to try out the bestseller bingsu which has almond flakes and rice cakes in it. It costs S$8 for it. Not cheap but it's not expensive for a bingsu. It was not the best bingsu but good enough. I don't regret having the bingsu for dessert.

I had the spicy flavour chicken and also the sweet flavour chicken. Both were really nice especially the Spicy flavour. The after taste is shiok. Get their rice also as it's not bad.

Maybe the best fried chicken I've had anywhere. Pretty quiet when we went and seemed to be the only place around Arab St open late. If this place existed in New York there would be a line out the door. Very friendly service too!

One of the best fried chicken ever!! May cost you a little more than the usual restaurant , but the taste is no joke!!! I love their soy flavor the most!!!

Wanted to try another place nearby but it was a 45 minutes wait. So family decided on this place instead. No regrets. We enjoyed our meal very much. There were five flavors for the chicken. The spicy flavor is hot! but enjoyable. My favorite is the garlic flavor. We also had the rice with seaweed... yummy!This place does not serve water, only bottled mineral water. It seemed that this is a trend now; a trend i don't care much for

I ate at the Cineleisure outlet. The chicken is deep-fried to the perfect state, being soft and succulent without too oily. My favourite is original flavor and spicy. Besides the chicken, it is highly recommended to try their rice-burger. I ordered the spicy rice-burger which contained beef and kimchi, OMGosh sooooo delicious. It is comforting to know that you can actually choose to eat healthy sin-less food at the chicken outlet ;

Love the rice burger that contains kimchi, seafood. Tried all the 3 flavours, all are very nicely done and flavourful. Love them all, if i have to choose one, it would be the tuna!Tried original, soy, garlic, sweet soy, garlic & spicy. Spicy is the best, the soy & garlic is also good. The sweet soy is just too sweet for my palate. Last visit tried the new flavour honey soy which is good too. My friends commented that this is better than 4 fingers and other korean chick wing places. Must try if u around Bali Lane, they have also a new outlet at Cineleisure at Orchard road

I tried the spicy rice burger with spam, spicy but nice. I want to try the non spicy burger with tuna next time badly! It must be nice. We ordered the original fried chicken, I personally feels they should be more tasteful than this. The spicy sauce fried chicken is very good. Love it

Came for the wings after hearing friends rave about it. The variety of flavours were impressive and the wings itself was good. Particularly liked the garlic ones. It had the sweetness of onions on top of the fragrance of the garlic. The spicy ones were a little too much for me but strangely it was spicy on the batter but the chicken meat inside was not as flavourful. Thumbs up! Tried the spam rice burger (cant remember the exact name) and i found it rather interesting. Like a giant sushi! Love it!

I came here 3 times in 2 days. Their fried chicken is simply heavenly delicious and irresistable. Spicy chicken here shudnt be missed by those who can tolerate spicy. It is spicy yet sweet! The taste is just beyonds description. Garlic flavor is a big yes yes too! Slurpsss!!!!!

I am an adventurer when comes to food. Chicken wing is something that I can't live without. A great piece of wing will boost up my mood. So I know what it takes to consider as a fantastic wing. Guess what, Choo Choo Chicken Wings are the top of the top I have ever tried so far.How I got to know about this hidden wings corner? It was through their promotion online when they were newly opened while back. I had it taken away, the wings looked and smelled so good that I can't help it to eat it on my way home on the street! I was like in heaven.Just last week, I was finally back to the neighborhood after a seminar nearby. At late hour close to 10 p.m, I was delighted they were still opened. Without any doubt, I ordered the 8 pieces wings. That's just a perfect meal for such timing, it won't make me feel overloaded before the bedtime. I won't deny that their price is a bit higher than others. But it's totally worth it if you are looking for the real deal. I had tried other places including the 4 Fingers, seriously after tried out twice, I was telling myself not wasting my time queuing up again. It's so not worth it. Overcooked and the sauce was overly done.Choo Choo Chicken Wing was just perfect for me. If you're a wing lover like me, I guarantee you'd love it
