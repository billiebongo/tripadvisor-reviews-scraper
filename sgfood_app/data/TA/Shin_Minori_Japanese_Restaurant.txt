Sashimi was fresh and in thick slices. However, the chawanmushi and the bbq stuff wasn't that great thought it doesn't matter as we are here for the Sashimi. Need to arrive early so that the wait for the orders will not be too long.
5
Sashimi was fresh and buffet selection was extensive. Quality of food served was great for the price we were paying. Service staffs were attentive to refill iced green tea
2
Food quality was not as good as previous round and waiting time was very long as our orders did not pass through the system and wasn't detected by staff. We had to keep asking and resubmit order again..
5
Food was very yummy and ambience was nice for chats. Service staff were very friendly and prompt in serving up food.
5
Been my usual go to place. Servings are huge and of good quality. But alightly expensive, plus the night ambience is too dar.
2
The buffet menu is long, and encompasses all styles of Japanese cuisine (except shabu shabu). The quality is pretty awful, worse than Sakae Sushi. We tried this out with the Entertainer 1-for-1 offer; otherwise, at $41.90++ per pax it’s not worth it, with such poor quality. Contrary to other reviews, we found the wait time quite good. Service is pro-active. Maybe an acceptable choice for some, but sorry it ain’t us

I had dinner with my family at Shin Minori Katong Square and have tried their buffet. Food was delicious and service was great.My next visit to Singapore I will not hesitate to go back and enjoy their delicious menu.With lot of choices sometimes waiting time is an issue however our experience was wonderful. I cannot wait go back..
2
Although the food was value-for-money, the waiting time for the food was way too long. Furthermore, staff seemed to lack communication and coordination amongst one another. When the food arrived, the number of portions we ordered for each dish were inaccurate, usually giving us a lesser amount than we ordered. Perhaps the system of ordering through an iPad during peak hours could be revised and an alternative method for ordering can be implemented if the kitchen and staff are unable to cope with the overwhelming number of orders being entered in a short period of time. Hopefully this can be improved on ASAP. By doing so, this will naturally improve the restaurant atmosphere. Thanks.

Ordered a Yusheng from Shin Minori Katong, when we went to collect we are greeted by a very loud & attitude not so good staff but that’s only the beginning of the bad service.When we asked were the chopsticks already packed? His reply was the most ridiculous & absurd reply we ever heard. His reply was chopsticks are only given for food order, at that moment we were like, you mean Yusheng is not food?!Then he continued he ridiculousness, by saying we don’t normally give chopsticks for Yusheng because all people buy home to eat mah & house sure got chopsticks what. We were speechless by such ignorance assumptions & bad attitude
1
Horrible service from the waitress and manager. Waitress made a mistake with one of the apps, told us she will ask the manager will honour it...just to get the final bill without anything honoured and manager refusing. What happened to the service it use to have 3 years back
3
Sashimi is good but everything else is sweet..... not really value for money as the pricing is quite high and calories is wasted for the meal.
4
Have been here quite a few time since in recent months. Service has definitely improved from years ago. Sashimi is very fresh, very worth the trip!
5
Food was wonderful and service was prompt! The staff would always clear our table every time we finished a dish to make space for our other dishes :)
4
Sashimi was excellent, but could use more variety overall. Would have been better if they provided some desserts to round off the meal.
5
Good large chunks of sashimi. Fast preparation and good service.Sushi is great too.. just make sure you check they come in 1's or 2's per order.
4
Went for birthday celebration with birthday voucher 1 for 1 buffet. Very worth it, huge menu and left satisfied
2
Food quality are average and inconsistent. Food are served very slowly and staffs are not very helpful when checking on orders.
5
We enjoy ourselves every time we go! Easy to find parking, wide range of food on offer and fast service.
4
Went for dinner. Place was smaller than expected and tables were quite close to one another even though there were makeshift dividers. Sushi was not bad but cooked food can be a little salty. Overall a little pricey.
4
Ambience is good, Food is with good quality!Love their yakitori and the sashimi is really fresh!Personally find that if their buffet includes drinks and dessert will be a plus!The only thing I do not like about the restaurant is that their seating is not very spacious.This is my 3rd visit, so if it is not good, i will not visit repeated isn't it?Overall, I definitely do recommend Shin Minori @ UE Square
4
Great price, food was tasty and they had quite a spread for me to choose from. Heard good reviews about it before I decided to try it personally and it did not disappoint me.
5
It was our first visit and it was perfect!
Definitely worth every cent.
Seafood was fresh, grilled meat was juicy and service was timely.
Need to fix your Japanese craving? This is the place and no worries about squeezing through crowds like in town.
5
The lunch buffet at Shin Minori is great! The selection and quality of food is really good. The service staff are also very friendly.
1
the fish all is too hard and not fresh. it is weird when you eat the food with hard feeling. Fish is a soft meat. The shashimi is just ok.
4
Celebrated my birthday at Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant @ UE Square. Food was served quite fast. Very good!
4
Good ala carte Japanese buffet with several different dishes and cooking styles.
Buffet price does not include drinks and plain water is chargeable.
4
The food quality has improved compared to last time I dine here. The service is good too. They clear your plates regulary. However, the lights in the restaurant is quite dim. I don't like to dine in so dark ambience but because of the food, I will come back again
4
I was a little disappointed as they do not have anything special for an actual day birthday celebration.A slice of cake for the birthday person would be a nice gesture. Nevertheless, we ordered a slice of cake and they provided the candle.The dessert and cakes were ala carte orders, not included in the buffet menu, yet the cake did not taste fresh.Other than these, the service and food were great!Will still recommend them for the Japanese buffet. There is a good range of varieties to choose from.
3
Food was ok, the service was average but the seating arrangement for 2pax was terrible. 4 tables of 2 seaters were squeezed tightly together with a Wooden panel to separate but it was claustrophobic in the middle 2 seats coz it’s too close to each other. For the price of the buffet , the seating arrangement was terrible. Felt like fast food joint. Won’t go back again .
1
I went there with my boyfriend for a casual dinner. We tried most of the items on the menu ranging from the sashimi, yakitori, udon and so on, but hardly any dish tasted satisfactory. The yakitori had a sauce on it which was extremely sweet that the dish felt like a dessert. The miso soup was bland. The soup of the kake udon was okayyy but the noodles are too soft, not sure if it is cooked for too long or what. The sushi were also just okay, i personally think places like koh grill and genki have better sushi though.. The lighting of the place is also rather dim, so it kinda brings in the sleepy feel especially after some food. Overall it was not a very nice experience and we didnt really enjoyed it. Its certainly not worth the price.
5
The food served was fresh and delicious while service was excellent with the staffs always providing attentive service
3
The food quantity is too little per serving then up we must keep ordering and their service of clearing the plates is quite slow but service standards still considered quite okay..
4
The booking is fast, easy and simple.
Quite a lot of food choices, even though some of the food they serve very slow and have get wrong items serve to our table but they quickly response to us.
5
Love the food variety and sashimi. Always visit every few months. Sashimi is fresh and thick cut.
:)
2
Had the lunch buffet. Fish wasn't very fresh imo and some were slightly sour. Nothing that really stood out frankly quite disappointing.
3
Was here for dinner, I liked that they had a lot of choices for yakitori. But they did lack choices in terms of other cooked foods. Service was fairly good and price is also acceptable, overall experience was still acceptable.
4
If you have a craving for sashimi, this is where you should go. And you get much more - an extensive menu that includes yakitori, sushi, agemono and much much more. A must try. Iâ€™ll surely be visiting again. My only gripe - the service could have been more attentive.
1
Food was not fresh resulting in us having the runs for 2 days. Service staff was not friendly and had a bit of black face when we asked to top up the drinks. Overall we didnt enjoy the food as much as before. Standard definitely dropped.
3
Paid $72.74 per pax with gst and service charge with green tea. Original price was $59.90++ during this "festive" period. Beverages needed to be top up separately. Went on Xmas Eve, restaurant was only 60% full, we were there from 7pm to 9pm. Its an ala-carte buffet, serving speed was ok. Salmon sashimi was quite fresh. Maki has too much rice, hence dont order too much. Yaki dishes, my friends love. Edamame was served hot, strangely. Mentaiko spaghetti was bland, dont try. Zaru soba was soggy, dont try. Chawanmushi was good, try it. Complimentary snow crab served was good. thank you. Good to try on non-festive periods, but still on the pricier side, wont go again.
3
reasonable pricing but space to small for good dining experience. Staff are friendly but they spoke mandarin which not everyone is able to communicate. Although the ordering process is good and high tech but the older customers will find it a challenge trying to use the pad for ordering their dishes.
4
Staff are friendly . Food is nice . Unable to try all as too many variety to choose. Will definitely go again.
3
Sashimi are fresh. Wide variety of choices. Udon & Soba not to expectation. Overall rating is average.
4
Good service, the birthday voucher is really worth it the money. Food is fresh will come again next time.
3
Liked the fact that the variety of food is really wide, but the service is really slow though. Some of our dishes took quite awhile to arrive, while others were forgotten. One came only when we were able to leave.
2
Went on a weekday lunch and there were only a few other tables occupied. Despite it not being packed, the food was being served slow. Coupled with the little variety available for its buffet, doubt we will return in the near future.
5
Came here with a few friends for dinner last week and was amazed at the more than 130+ items on the menu. The sashimi slices were thick and we had a huge spread of food on our table. Reasonably priced too!
5
this is my go to restaurant for jap buffet, esp with its 1 for 1 deal. cheap but quality food and a wide variety of choices !
2
This was not my first visit but i was greatly disappointed with the poor service and poor quality of food. The tuna sashimi did not have any taste, the grilled dishes we had, were bad. The quail eggs had a plastic texture, the chicken liver were hard and dry, the chicken skin was just hard and has a burnt smell. The service staff simply placed the plates at the corner of the table, despite space in the middle of table.
4
We enjoyed the food as the portion is decent and the quality is better than we expected for buffet. The only thing that can be better is cleanliness of the place as our seats initially were dirty which the waiter offered to clean up for us and the floor had paper napkins too
5
I have been to Shin Minori several times in the past. Always a great experience. Last week I had a visiting colleague from Japan (native Japanese). I decided to take him to Shin Minori. High risk, right ? Never take someone from a foreign country, familiar with how their food should be, to a restaurant of their heritage, for them to compare against, right ?I had confidence in Shin Minori, as my prior experiences were all great.My friend gave Shim Minori 2 thumbs up! (I wasn't all that surprised!).The sushi, Temaki (hand rolls) were great (but how can you mess up raw fish,right?). The cooked meals were also great (and that was where the real challenge was). Tori Wasabi Mayo (Grilled chicken with wasabi mayo), Kani Tenpura (soft shell crab), Yaki Onigiri (Grilled minced chicken balls), so many other items to choose from, all great.Great service. Great ambiance
4
More variety will be good as no soft shell crab. If can provide drinks will be much more better as price not cheap for lunch buffet.
5
Awesome experience. Food is good and fresh. Service is ok, free birthday cake, and ambiance is great for family gathering too.
4
Sashimi is fresh and waitresses are friendly. I like the sashimi. Lacks dessert though and would have been great if 5hey offer ice cream.
4
We are a group of 4 old school pals meeting up for dinner. This place was offered quite a good spread for an ala carte buffet! You get sashimi and sushi, tempura and some meat dish too. They also have noodles like soba and udon. Overall it’s a very good deal if you like JAPANESE food. Don’t expect fine dining but I’ll say that they are above average. I’d definitely return another day!!
3
Overall food quality is quite good and value for money. However the beef cooked in onion and special sauce has a very strong smell of beef and portion given is too big for 2.Tables for 2 are placed too close to each other so can be very noisy.
3
This is my second time coming here for their Buffet. Food is still as good but I felt that the standard dropped a little. Their food portion became smaller. The maki we ordered used to have grilled cheese on top that made is taste so darn good but right now all they have is the just some sauce drizzled on top of it. Also the yaki tori gizzard that we ordered were so small. It was cut into very tiny pieces unlike before where it’s was much bigger. On a side note, the store fried beef was really good. You have to try that one. Our overall experience was good although our orders took some time to come. Food and service was good. Would give it a 3.5 rating if I could.
4
The selection was quite wide and sashimi was fresh. Especially loved the salmon and swordfish sashimi. The maki rolls were great as well, it was rare to see innovative maki rolls (like rainbow roll, dragon) offered in a buffet instead of the usual California roll. Of course the taste still cannot beat an ala carte order of dragon roll at other japanese restaurant but I am satisfied as it was to have it on the buffet menu. The waiting time can take sometime during busy hours. Best to go early and order quickly
3
There’s no free lunch, any Free treat comes with a Min condition- 1 adult Ala Carte buffet lunch excl drink.For ala Carte lunch of $40++ (Tax incl) per pax rate in near town, UE Square, consider ex but value for 2 though with limited public accessibility.We paid for 2 pax with drinks total spent $105+/- for a family of 3 buffet lunch on birthday. So it’s not Free in our context.As the voucher is for all year redemption, so it’s subjective to individual Budget.AC Buffet offers wide spreads, recommended sashimi, chawanmushi, handrolls & teppanyaki/bbq items.Tried most of the recommended on menu, some good some average
5
New outlet at Katong squareNeed to print voucher for a one for one. Need to go their website .Lots of selections from sashimi sushi,sushi rolls,yakitori,ramen, soups, even pizzas.Must tryIf you are staying in katong holiday inn or hotel indigo or nearby joochiat hotels.

Headed over to Shin Minori (UE Square outlet) for the lunch buffet on last Sunday afternoon, because of the pleasant experience sometime in June.Took a little while before we were shown to our seats, but completely understandable due to the staff busy serving the many tables. However, when indicating to the supervisor/manager about a promotion code that we would like to utilise for the lunch buffet, he seemed rather disgruntled, where instructions for us to redeem the code sounded rather blunt. We felt the tone was rather uncalled for, as discount or not, we are still paying patrons. Nonetheless, we brushed it off rather quickly, and waited for our orders to arrive.Food arrived and they were as great as the previous time we had visited. The raw fish tasted fresh, and the Dragonfly Sushi was one of our favorites such that we had ordered twice. The meat dishes were nothing to shout about, but were still good. We were a little disappointed, though that a version of the cheese croquet (previously available) was not there anymore. The staff attending to us did not quite understand what we were conveying too well, probably because she was new to the job.So 2.50pm came and the same manager/supervisor came round our table, shoving the bill to us, and the tone used in informing us of the closing time felt rather pushy. While we understand the place closes at 3pm, we felt that a different tone used would have made the experience more pleasant, instead of making customers feel like they are being chased out.All in all, for the food we will definitely head back again, with hope that the next dining experience will be somewhat better
4
Even though the waiting time for the food is a bit long, but I think is okay since the food is nice. (You order through the tablet)
3
Not the first time come here, reasonable price for japanese buffet. Service is not the best, but food is good
5
Arguably one of the best Japanese buffets I've ever had so far. If you're really particular about your sashimi, then Shin Minori probably wouldn't disappoint as their thickly-sliced sashimi is really fresh and delicious. I'd certainly go back there again for my next sashimi indulgence.
5
Great deal when there is a birthday voucher. Reservation went smoothly, food selection is great while sashimi is a steal.
5
Good selection of Japanese food at this ala carte buffet. The yakitori especially was really good. The sashimi was really fresh. Would have been even better if other drinks and dessert were included.
4
salmon was fresh but swordfish slightly off that day. nevertheless, the rest of the food was decent.
4
Buffet is pretty good. Ordering is done through a tablet. However a cup of ice water or green tea costs money!
3
friendly gd service though slow at peak lunch time. v crowded on a Friday and tables were so close i can see and hear everything the couple said beside us. sashimi was thick and great. tempura were hot and crispy, even the tempura sauce. extensive grilled items menu which was great too.the rice items eg the hand rolls/temaki, sushi, and sushi rolls were not good though. ridiculous amount of rice
5
I've been here before and loved it, so I brought my mum this time so she could try it too. Very reasonable pricing for such great quality. The sashimi is fresh and the portions generous. This is a good choice because everyone gets to order what they want (not hampered by different preferences)
1
Decided to visit Shin Minori after reading raving reviews online.Firstly the food was substandard.Nothing like the impressions I read from other reviews.Worst of all, I was denied a credit card promotion just because the staff said so.Terms and conditions on their website wasnâ€™t clearly written resulting in great ambiguity
4
Buffet spread was quite big but I wished desserts were included. Sashimi was good and I love their stir-fried beef dish!!
4
food was nice. serving was fast. just the place is too cramp. table to table too close. can't talk freely. no privacy. just eat.
5
Really love the quality of food here! It’s also quite affordable, lunch buffet was $40++/per and if it’s your birthday month you can also get to dine for free with mins 2 adults
4
Worth the money, selection interesting but just go for sashimi!
Orders can be delayed and missed. Otherwise worth a visit.
3
For the affordable prices, you get average quality food and below average service levels.
Also, the place looks like it needs a revamp badly.
Not a place for serious lovers of Japanese cuisine.. read connoisseurs.
3
Food was average, service was less than average. Tori skewer was cannot make it at all.. taste dry and not much of flavouring.
4
Value for money. The restaurant serves a good spread with fresh sashimi. Atmosphere is cozy and suitable for family or friends gathering.
4
Minori has always been my favourite Jap buffet restaurant due to its affordability and wide range of selection. Ambience is great too.
3
Food was not bad, but sashimi could have been fresher. Grilled dishes were very salty, so was the agedashi tofu. Worth it given the birthday voucher but if not for it then probably not. iPad ordering is good but can include a page on the outcome of the food i.e. an ordered list, cooking/preparing list and then a served list so that customers know what dishes has arrived, what they have ordered and hasn't arrived and what dishes they are eating. iPad also better to be held, not clamped to table as it was quite hard to maneuver. But overall not bad, service good too. Would go again if there's similar discount/1-1
2
The ambience of the restaurant was reasonable. Service was slow to response and the AI ordering system was not friendly at all. The touch Pad home button was poorly fitted into a metal housing hole which was poorly done and needed really very small fingers to access. Food quality was good but slow to be served after the ordering. My overall experience was average for the restaurant, compensating was the waitress who was very helpful to take photos for us. If you want to be good, you must look into the touch Pads and the holding structures. AI Technology should enhance the ordering experience and not to turn guest away.
4
Abit pricy at $40++ for weekday lunch buffet. Sashimi and sushi are nice. Only worth it if one of you has the birthday voucher.
5
Been to shin minori many times. love the fresh sashimi and its value for money especially when dine on your birthday day month.
4
I like the concept of the restaurant where you are served the food ordered through a tablet. Its a better buffet in that sense.
3
The restaurant serve a huge range of fresh and premium sashimi. It's delicious! Food were served hot. However, agemono dishes were disappointing, batter was too thick.
4
Food came pretty fast but somehow because it was a Friday night, a lot of our orders came in repeat ! Maybe can opt going on mon-thurs when there's less people to avoid such. Food was okay not bad for a Japanese buffet.
3
The foods are delicious but portion of the food for each order for the ala carte buffet is too small. The staffs are not proactive to provide spoons & wasabi when soup and sushi are served. Have to ask for wasabi twice before it was served.Servers are chinese speaking.
5
very good selection. love how they had pumpkin in their chawanmushi. got to try their japanese fried rice and mentaiko spaggheti! Not salty yet fragrant! sashimi is melt-in-mouth even for tuna which normally doesn't taste well in most japanese restaurants! Price is very reasonable and service is quick
3
We had a family dinner for 7 at their Katong Square outlet. Selection was decent enough and the sashimi was nice. Not what I would consider “great japanese ala-carte buffet” cos we’ve had better. Perhaps a sign of this was a really small number of tables were occupied tonight. Perhaps they make up during weekends. Sashimi was nice but not the best based on price. Tempura was nice but a bit on the oily side and batter wasn’t light enough. Pasta was sticking and clumping up. Grilled selection was either bland, which I’m ok with since I appreciate natural flavours but the sauce for some grilled selection like chicken liver was way too salty. Wasabi wasn’t evenly fresh with some bits with a lil kick but mostly bland. Grilled pork with garlic had an overkill of garlic to the point where it drowned out the flavour of the pork. All in all, good for a one time visit but I won’t be going back anytime soon. Good but not great.
4
This is my second visit to the restaurant. After my first visit , the experience was good and decided to bring my family down for a meal since it was my daughter birthday as well. The food was well portion as instruction was clear on the ipad on how many piece was served. The sashimi was fresh and we all enjoyed our self. Will definitely be back in the future
5
The food is good but the pricing is quite high for children, only $10 cheaper compared to adult price. Certain dish was served very late. I liked the chawamushi with pumpkin sauce. Empty dishes were cleared very fast which is a plus point especially when the tables are not spacious
3
Service and food was a little slow as the restaurant was quite busy, but food was ok. There was a good variety of food. And love the snow crab soup. Jus remember to print out the voucher.
4
My favourite dish is fried baby cuttlefish and chicken wing. Raw salmon is fresh and juice. May be can try to ask for tables with portable ipad for making order instead of the one that stick onto the partition.
4
quite a variety of food. sashimi is fresh and tasty. other cooked foods are so-so. desserts and beverages not included in the buffet and chargeable. service is so-so.
5
A great experience..
I will introduce my friends to this Japanese restaurant..
Looking forward to coming back again..
5
Very fast and polite service crew. Great food especially the meat dishes. Will definitely come back.
4
good overall experience. prompt confirmation of reservation but was not aware of 2 shifts until i call up.
5
Sashimi swordfish, octopus, tempura and pumpkin chawanmushi were good. Lesser variety for teppanyaki. Should have included free flow green tea in the buffet menu instead of charging it separately in the bill. Used the birthday voucher on that day.
4
I like the foods but Hard to call for service and serving food service abit slow
Hope next attempt I can see the improvement from you all
Thanks
4
Food was yummy and service was good. Food came piping hot and fresh. I gave it a 4/5 because there is no desert on the menu. Otherwise would have been a perfect 5.
2
Utilised the birthday voucher, and tried it out for the first time. Not impressed with food but worse is the service. The sushi rice vinegar was too overloaded. The yakitori items were overcooked. Finally the service was very the 不甘愿。Its ok because we will not be patronising again even if there is free dining for both. In addition, first time using Chope Reservation and the number 68714254 kept calling me to confirm despite me having confirmed after reservation, then 15 mins before reservation and then after being in restaurant for 30 mins already. It auto called me back when I ended the call and in the end, I had to block the number. Will steer clear of Chope Reservation in the future
5
Came many times , this time was the birthday voucher so we came back. Sashimi quality is good.
The rest are all good too. Worth the visit if you haven't been here. Try go during promotions.
4
Enjoy the food and the services are good too as the waitress clear the empty plates automatically without us to call for.
3
There was a great selection of food but I didn’t not manage to try them all. Those that I tried taste pretty good but the staffs seems a bit short handed.
3
The dishes are terrible, does not match the pictures. Also the addition of random sauces on the various dishes spoil the taste. Portions are always inconsistent.
5
The sashimi was fresh and thickly cut. The sushi and yakitori didn't fail to impress either. Will visit again!
4
Food is good but would be better if there are more varieties for the buffet. Only salmon sashimi and steamed egg chawanmushi were served fast, the rest took quite a Long time. Longest was like half an hour for the chicken wing. Suggest to order more things at one go so that You don't have to wait so Long. Saw a mini spider on the table btw
4
We went on a Friday lunch for the ala-carte buffet - it was quite crowded and the dishes took awhile to come. They tend to miss out certain dishes if you order a variety of dishes at once, so try to order in small quantities. Also, note that the drinks and dessert are not included in the buffet. Regardless, the staff were friendly; the best thing was the sashimi, which was really fresh and good value for money. Their sushi options are interesting and taste good too
4
Shin Minori provides you with the typical buffet experience- you can get quite a bit of average food for your money, but the service is sub-par. Many of the servers didn't speak English and weren't able to understand our requests. The food came out relatively quickly except for the grill items, and when we were missing a lot of items we ordered, the wait staff told us that all the orders had been fulfilled. We therefore re-ordered the missing items and they showed up twice (beware of this happening as there is a food wastage charge of $10/100g). The food is decent, though you shouldn't be expecting the most high quality sushi from a buffet restaurant. The gyoza was quite good, as well as the fried soft-shell crabs. It was an easy place to go with a large group and share lots of items.
2
At 1st we request to chance sit, but staff ingrone us2nd the taplet when we use for place order always connect error 3rd the food that we order never come staff still blame that is we never place order. Any way this is 3rd time I go, but the service become worse and worse...
3
This review has a good rating.I must have visited at least 6 times in the last couple of years. In awe for the first few visits but not last night. My son’s second visit and he said he will return. Perhaps my expectations were higher or I didn’t enjoy any ambience there. There was none to mention. Sashimi especially the salmon, yellow tail and sword fish were fresh. Some maki and skewers were good. But a couple of dishes were very salty. Service was lacking. The vegetables tempura was the first few items my son ordered and did not arrive until the end of our dinner. We had to remind them at least 5 times because each time we were told another 2 or 3 minutes.It is already quite pricey and yet water is chargeable at 80 cents and green tea at $1.90. I can’t. Personally, I won’t go back but if my son wanted to, I will go with him. And I didn’t even take any pictures last night
5
loved the food! loved the spread. really enjoyed it.
would come back again.
my mates enjoyed it as well.
5
No fuss restaurant. Was quite pack when we got there. Better to get reservation early to avoid disappointment. Although during peak hours your orders tend to come slower
4
Food was okay. Not fantastic but the food arrived really quickly despite the restaurant being quite busy. Staff were quick to clear empty plates.
5
value for money fresh sashimi!
wasabi was shiok ah!
ventilation a bit weak so feels a bit oily during meal
3
There were many choices to choose from if someone like variety. However, I find the sushi is average.
4
Good quality food and attentive service. Good cut of Sashimi and fresh. Don't miss the Fried chicken. However the grilled items with salt needed more flavouring. No dessert included for buffet.
3
Food was average but decent for the price. However, we faced a lot of technical difficulties during ordering. Our ipad failed like five times and had to ask for assistance. That certainly affected our dining experience as we had to resubmit all our orders.
4
food taste is ok, nothing too special.
flavor is good, but serving size is small and service could be better
3
Crowded. Food is average. Some food not cook in Japanese way like quail egg. They fried it before grill. The cold dish sour plum cucumber..they did not use Japanese cucumber so the taste was weird. 1 order paper was tucked under 1pc of our salmon teriyaki. Is not a hygiene way of serving. My Japanese friends are not impressed. I was shocked too. The order tablet hang at least 3 times and created double order. We showed the staff we had already finished our food but the service staff kept showing us 2 orders of same food. We thought is our mistake so we accepted it. The 3rd times it happened we spoke to someone higher and he was more understanding and removed the extra food we did not order. Is my first time at Shin Minori and is a little disappointing experience for a Japanese Restaurant. I may try again if they improve on food quality and hygiene standard
3
We've dined in this restaurants regularly for a few years. The food quality is pretty consistent throughout. However, I must say the service is not as good as before and the sitting space is getting smaller and smaller. In our last visit to Shin Minori last weekend, the water bottle that they gave us with the ice water is full of mold! No kidding, I wish i could post a photo here....tsk ts
4
There is ongoing birthday promotion which makes weekday lunch buffet value for money. No time limit.
4
Nice ambience and restaurant. Food was also above average standard. Especially like the sashimi. However aburi items have room for improvement

Good service and food. I was late but they still served me the lunch irregardless. Great service. Good variety.
5
Excellent food, sashimi is fresh, and their maki is my favourite . Great service. Nerve fail to dissapoint us..
5
As usual, the salmon sashimi is a draw for me. Very good! Won't be my last time. Will look forward to going again with my family.
5
Booking is easy. The food is great. It comes out on time too. The service could be better. They werent very friendly when our tablet (to order food) wasn't working and loss all our previous orders so we had to restart.

I will never go back to this restaurant. Stated 80 cents for cold water and free refill. Ordered one for son's girlfriend cos my son and i are not in the habit of drinking water while eating. Refill was good until when the crowd came in. Asked to refill, manager came to tell me that it's the restaurant's policy for customer to order the no. of water accdg to the no.of pax. Tried to see their fine prints but couldn't find. Felt insulted tat he's implying we shared, saving$1.60 after having tho pay close to$150 for the meal. So we told them no need to refill.

We booked this place through Chope to celebrate our second kid's birthday. Trying out for the first time. We end there at 630pm Sat (it was also the F1 weekend) It was quite crowded by the time we went there and full house by around 7 plus. Every one there went for the buffet. Order system was via the ipad/samsung tab. Our food was served after that.Servings was generally small portions to very small portions - more like for one person servings. We thought it was fine as this will help to minimize wastage.There was 5 of us, so when our initial order was served, we quickly adjusted and order more servings for each item. Overall the food and experience was just average. The staff and service was ok. For us, the most important was that the family had a good time and the birthday kid liked the meal treat. It was memorable

Cosy restaurant parked in a not so crowded UE shopping mall.... good thing.Restaurant usually packed so reservations recommended. Have private rooms and floor seating sections too. Would be better if there were more space to cater for many more patrons.The buffet alacarte menu is commendable. The spread is wide and quality of the food served is excellent. Sections of sashimi, sushi, tempura, maki, rolls, barbecue, salad, noodles, rice, and much more.Good and fast service and orders are placed thru electronic apps (tablets). Sushi and barbecue orders takes a bit longer though as it's made fresh.The buffet price excludes dessert and drinks, though.... and kids below 5 yrs old eat for free & child rates up to 10 yrs old.Highly recommended and happy eating

I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience at Shin Minori. Some colleagues and I visited for their lunch buffet and to our amazement, the claim of having more than 160 dishes is fo'real! There was a wide selection of dishes from rice and noodles to soup, sushi, sashimi, appetizers, maki, yakitori and teppanyaki - all this for $45 (including service charge and government tax). Service was good and the waiters were very responsive. The ambience is quiet and peaceful and I like that they do not enforce a time limit for the buffet. A little tip: if you go on their website, you'll find vouchers for special add-on items (for free). We were gifted a free snow crab nabe that was deeelicious! I have recommended this place to friends and family and will definitely be doing a second round there.
3
Very unlucky that the next table is a group of ladies who talk loudly.
It was really terrible and they really ruined the great atmosphere!
4
One of my favorite places to go to (with a good view) for affordable Japanese food at HarbourFront area.
4
The disappointing thing is we requested for a corner table, but it wasn't given even when the restaurant was 80% empty. Otherwise, cooked food were mostly served warm so it was delicious.
4
The Japanese Buffet spread is good and it is value for money. The service is good and the ambience is also conducive. Just feel that perhaps, Shin Minori can provide free flow of soft drinks.
4
The booking was done throu chope easily. The service was fast and efficient. Food was alright. I wish the sashimi was better. i like the complimentary dish. One or two items were a little salty. But overall it was okay.
5
Celebrating my boyfriend's birthday in Shin Minori. Fresh food and friendly staffs. Will go back there again.
4
The service has improved over the past one year, more efficient and the food quality maintained, still as good
3
Food was alright. Service got messy due to crowd. Many disruption for wifi digital food ordering too. Avoid going on Fridays especially if you want to be having a peaceful, comfortable and enjoyable get together. Loud noisy big groups made the place so rowdy and noisy that you can hardly even hear yourself. Popularity equates to such I guess. Quite turning off.
4
Had birthday voucher for one free buffet lunch, but still found it on pricier side. Food was mostly fresh because prepared on the spot. Sashimi a bit fishy, and beef dish was dry and overcooked. Fried items were really great though! Food portions were very thoughtfully adjusted for tasting amounts, but became way too much later on. Overall, good variety and quality
3
The food was alright, not terribly impressive or yummy. Had been hoping to get the birthday free buffet but unfortunately, we were told we couldn't get it on public holidays. That wasn't stated in the birthday treat page. What's more, that day itself was my husband's birthday! All orders were done via an ipad â€” would have been nice to be able to key in special requests in there. They had the option to select but could not key in anything, so as good as not having
3
Food is average and eat all you like but not fantastic but still overall is ok. Will i go again, well maybe.
5
We took the $52 offer with dinner buffet and 52mins free flow wine, beer and fruits juice. Freshness of the foods were superb, no comments on it! We love the foods very much. Order thru ipad, and serve fast.
3
This is my second time visiting this restaurant. As usual, the sashimi were fresh. But the grill is not so good, either it's over cooked or too dry. It might be due to the crowded as the restaurant was packed.
2
I have recently visited another japanese buffet lunch with similar price, Shin Minori can't compete in the following areas : food quality, food quantity, menu display (does not show actually serving quantity).
4
Good is nice with various variety, but service not so good. Had ordered food, waited very long, did not serve and was asked to reorder again when we checked out order. Was told no more order chit with them.
5
Food was really good, small enough portions for us to try many different dishes. Making the reservation was also rly convenient through Chope.
4
the waiter and waitress are attentive. food is nice and variety. the serving is fast but the bbq food too dried and not juicy.Drink not included in the buffet price.
3
average food. would rather visit hokkaido sushi at hotel M for the same price but definitely better standard. service was great, dishes were served quickly without having to wait for long and empty plates were cleared promptly as well.
4
Sashimi was of decent quality, food tasted not too bad as well. Worth it if you are a sashimi lover.
3
I picked this restaurant to have my birthday lunch as it had a birthday promo for the lunch a-la-carte buffet. Prior that day I had signed up and received a voucher which I didn't know had to be screenshotted (they did not send a copy to my email). The day before I was due for lunch, I looked in my email for a copy of the voucher but it wasn't there so so tried to apply for it again. And when I did, the website prompted me that I have already been registered. To cut the Long story short, when I explained to the staff about the mix-up, he deliberately just told me that there was nothing I could do about it. Which was a rather weak attempt at service recovery, in my opinion. I considered walking out (I had not ordered yet) but still decided to give the place a shot. I paid for 2 buffets with 2 bottles of sake and was satisfied with the meal however, it was one of the lower moments on my birthday.
3
Food was ok, not worth for kids unless your kid can eat. 5 years and above is already chargeable which was not much cheaper than adult price. No kids menu.
5
sashimi are thickly sliced and there are a widespread of variety for cooked food. came here multiple times and still loving it!
5
Service is good. Was greeted
Buffet Food is nice. There's alot Variety of food to choose. Environment is good too.
5
Loved this buffet promotion and the food tasted great and value for $. Order food via ipad is fast and efficient indeed :)
5
The sashimi were fresh and the sushi and cooked food were delicious! Portions for some dishes were huge too. Would definitely be back!
3
Theres an electronic system for you to order your food and you can see pictures of various different food, however the system is quite slow and clashed a few times. Some of our orders did not come despite several reminders from us.
4
First visit. The food was good, varied but not much seafood choices. Will revisit for food. Nothing outstanding for service and atmosphere..
3
Food variety not as much compared to other ala carte buffet. Quality of food are ok but not the quantity.
3
General impression was not bad. Do not order the kimichi dishes as it tasted weird. Drinks are charged separately.
4
Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant is a wonderful place to go to with friends and/or family. Ordering via a tablet was easy to use, and the food came rather promptly after we sent our order. The food was fresh, I especially loved the Salmon sashimi and skewers. Good value for money!
4
Food was good for ala carte jap food ...service abit slow as they are v busy with the crowd . Good for gatherings!
4
Came for birthday one for one lunch buffet. Sashimi is fresh! Would visit again when there are promotions - next year
4
Great food and service. Agreed by my family members too. Dinned many times and will return again. Thumbs up!
4
The food is fresh and good. Value for money and good place to hangout. They should put a clock for the free 52min free flow of drinks.
1
The female supervisor service is very unprofessional. Show black face & very rude. I don't understand how can such a person can work in a Japanese Restaurant & in a supervisor role.
4
Very fresh sashimi, wide variety, easy ordering through ipad. Friendly staff and food serving time is reasonable.
5
Fresh sashimi, many varieties and choices of authentic Japanese food to choose from. Nice ambience and good service.
5
Came on a busy Sunday afternoon for the lunchtime buffet using the Entertainer app (1-for-1 promotion). We ordered the sashimi platter several times and it was amazing. Highly recommend the sashimi (Tuna and Salmon) as it is very fresh. Staff were also very friendly and efficient. However, with that being said, I think the place can also improve further. For example, my partner and I were seated at a table which was very squeezy. We were placed next to the utensils drawers. It ruined the ambience for me, as I was constantly listening to the staff pulling and closing the drawers (it was very loud as well). The restaurant uses the "tablet menu", and for my partner and I, the table was already small enough (2 platters and the table would be too full for even a cup of water), there was no space (no drawer, compartment below table) for the tablet so we had to lean it against the wall standing up.
4
Had the $52 buffet (NDP promo) with 52 mins of free flow drinks and alcohol. Sashimi was thick and fresh as usual. What stood out were surprisingly the tori karaage. We had multiple servings of that. The skewers were awesome too, marination was on point, and they were all served hot.
3
they have options for vegetarians in teh sushi etc a dwill rmeove teh spring onion garnishing for uhowever the sushi rice is mad eiwth rice wine so if allergic to the alchol all cant have thatthe grille ditems are nice too and the chef and staff wer every helpfulwe got a voucher at the end too!it was pricey buut i wenet on the birthday viucher promotion so that was GREAT one for on
3
Fresh, thick and juicy for sashimi. Other choice of food is just average, The buffet should include dessert and drink.
4
This restaurant is one of our favorite Japanese restaurant in Singapore. The quality of food is really amazing! They always ensure that patrons can enjoy promotion like Birthday Treats.
4
Good food but price has creep up a little since last visit. The buffet will be more appealing if free flow tea is included. Sashimi is fresh.
3
But it deliever too slowly. The foood was not bad. I but the susji rice portion was too much. If it' s bettet, i will visit again.
3
Quite good service not bad and good served fast. Just that no drinks provided and also our seats were not conducive
5
Super good sashimi! Wide range of choices including sashimi free flow and japanese BBQ you wont't regret especially with 1 for 1 from Entertainer
4
Brought my dad there for lunch and we both really enjoyed the freshness of the sashimi and overall food quality. Hope to see some little desserts included in the ala carte buffet to end off the meal. Dropped a star as i felt the tables were placed so close to each other that we were able to hear each other's conversations
4
Great selection of food, the sashimi is really fresh and they are generous with the portions. Maki and cooked food also quite decent. Only items our group didn't like were the grilled items (mainly the items on skewer) as the restaurant had grilled all items until they were too dry! Sometimes food came slower as it got busier but still ok.Star items: sashimi, grilled salmon, unagi items
1
This is by far one of the WORST Japanese restaurant !Food served was extremely salty ! Food is marinate with salt ONLY ! ( If you love salty food ! go for it )Raw fish served has a fishy smell as compare to others.Staff service was worst - don't expect a smile from any staff. ( If they ever smile at you , CONGRATS ! you are really lucky
5
It has been a pleasant dining experience. Swift and easy transition to our table upon arrival. The quality of food is good and I especially like the portion of food served. Most food was served a piece at a time allowed us to decide if we want more of those food which we ordered previously. The waiters are attentive and extended help almost immediately when the computer system hanged. Will visit again!
4
The buffet is value for money but the price does not include drinks. Food is nice and the ambience is suitable for big group.
4
Not the usual kind of buffet where you walk around to get your food but you order from and iPad. Food was ok, nothing special. Lots of variety though!
5
Good service! Despite me attending at near closing hour of buffet, staff still assisted to help us order. Food were fresh and quickly prepared!
5
Awesome as usual with my girlfriend last Friday 11.30 a.m. Decent variety of Japanese style food despite slow service.
2
The attitude of hostess was arrogant. I think that's because the business was too good. There's no personnel touch nor smile from her.
2
I've come here before. This time the sashimi was thin and wasn't presented as well. The skewers were a letdown - dry and lacking flavour. My only comfort is that we were using half-off vouchers
4
Awesome food as usual! Love their creamy salmon sashimi. And it's superb that you can order food by pieces!
3
The resturant was quite crowded, i believed it is because of its jap buffet offering. The sashimi was good, but the rest of them was average or below average, especially the yakitori, the sauce is very bad and cold. The green tea is blant, service was o
1
Cashier was poor in explaining use of Entertainer App and misled us to purchase the app usage instead of voucher for buffet. Subsequently accused us of non payment while being rude and sarcastic. Self ordering app in iPad kept crashing and we waited in vain for food that did not turn up. Reorders were made but not all the food arrived.
2
The service was bad - preferential treatment for those having the ala carte buffet. When my family and Indonesian family friends were there last weekend, we were advised after being seated that our food would arrive in 20-30 min because they will service those going for the ala carte buffet first. As we were using the Entertainer app, they told us that the free items would be the chawanmushi after seeing that we had ordered it. We then asked whether we could cancel the orders since it had only been a few minutes since we ordered. However, we were informed that it was too late because the chawanmushi had already been prepared and was about to be served to us. The chawanmushi for ala carte buffet goers is different because our chawanmushi contained a prawn. As such, I would not recommend going to this restaurant unless you want to go for their ala carte buffet.
4
The food is good and will definitely come back again. The place is a bit too dark to dine in and hard to snap a picture
4
The service there was excellent. Not only that the food was fresh and delightful. Definitely do come here if your willing to try a variety of Japanese food.
3
the place looks a bit crammed because of the way they arrange the tables and seats. order via tablet (which crashed a couple of times). sometimes they miss a few items in the order. called for service (via the tablet) but no staff came over. slowly in clearing dishes. sashimi quite fresh. other hot items are quite average. some came piping hot, some came a little cold. noisy on a weekday afternoon. stated last order at 2.15pm but staff came to remind us last order at 1.55pm
2
I brought my gf to this place for her birthday. There was a one-for-one promotion for birthday month. Staff say we need voucher which needs to be done online. We asked if we can do on the spot. They were very inflexible on that.. the food took a long time to serve as well
4
Service was very efficient and fast. Liked how each order of the rice rolls came in pairs so we were able to try more variety. Salmon and swordfish sashimi were fresh and good and especially liked the Dragonfly and Crunchy Makis! Great dining experience and extremely value for money with the wide variety available (
4
Food was alright, the tempura a little oily. Servers sent food to wrong tables. Had to place order twice before I got my food. Very convenient to order thru ipad. Saves the trouble of calling the waiter. Waiter did not understand that I wanted soya sauce to put the wasabi in. Gave me a whole dish of wasabi. Need more training.
4
Great Buffet! Recommended to try! Staff were polite, friendly and attended to our request promply. The atmosphere was good, just that the table was a little small as it couldn't fit all our foods. But luckily the staff clear off fast! For location wise, it's a little inconvienence for me as I stay in the East
3
Sashimi was really thick n fresh the first time, but far inferior in the subsequent round. Not properly defrosted, so the bite is not crunchy n fresh, but rather breaks apart n slightly mushy. The carbs are also quite badly done, turning dry n tough from the microwave reheating. The sushi n rolls are nice though
3
Service was extremely fast and servings were small, which was good as you can try as many food items as possible. However, apart from the fresh sashimi, the other food items were only average tasting in my opinion. Buffet does not come with complimentary water nor dessert
3
I went with my wife for dinner at 21 July 2017 using the reservation service from Chope. This was our second visit to the restaurant for this year.1. Service was average to slightly above average. The restaurant was busy but staff were responsive. Most of the staff don't look too happy, except for the filipino waitress who was serving our area.2. Food was below average in general. Salmon sashimi was good as usual. Sushi was one of the winners, although I felt that the rice portion could have been reduced by 50%. The swordfish sashimi was not palatable - yes, this was the same as our first visit. Swordfish/Mekajiki is one of my favourite, hence I ordered it again, hoping that it would somehow it would be better this round - sigh! All other dishes were below average.3. Ambience - you almost have to be shouting to have a conversation. So don't expect too much.We had wanted to use our Entertainer app, but only realised that it was for lunch buffet when we arrived. Hence, we paid over $100 for 2 pax for the dinner.For this amount of money, I definitely can find something better. I suggest to go this place only if you are big fan of sushi, salmon sashimi and only if you have a 1 for 1 promotion coupon
3
The restaurant seemed to be overwhelmed by the ala carte buffet's orders which came slow and understaff too.
3
Originally intended to use the entertainer app during dinner hours but soon realised that the menu they offered are geared more for buffet. The Ala carte serving was too little to justify the app. Buffet was so so. Bland for most. Here for the sashimi.
4
had the ala carte buffet dinner. there was a good enough variety for sashimi, grilled and fried items. too bad, desserts are not included in buffet.
5
Sumptuous Japanese buffet. Fresh sashimi and a variety choice of food. Good service! Recommend for family gathering.
4
The buffet covers a wide variety of food but some items we ordered are not so tasty. The sashimi is great so if that's what you are looking for then it is a good place to go.
4
Have dined a couple of times. A varieties of food. Have to pay for drinks but still reasonable. Great food & Service. My family and friends always enjoyed their dinner at Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant! Thumbs up! Reservations is extremely easy too and impressive.
5
The selection is great, and the quality is good too! A buffet that is worth it and have been back many times!
3
I chose to dine at Shin Minori after reading an online review.The ambience was average and the seating cramp.Staff were well mannered but not too helpful. The supervisor (maybe captain or manager) made sure we knew her status because when I asked her for assistance, she would delegate a waiter or waitress to respond to me instead.The first 3 plates of sashimi were fresh but after that it was soft and warm.Other dishes were mostly served singular and in extremely small portions. It was frustrating to see the food served in this manner. They were like children's masak masak dishes! However, must say the salad was impressive... crisp and tasty dressing!My daughter had a cake after dinner and said it was small in portion and tasted below average.After our visit, my family members said it wasn't value for money and they'd prefer to eat elsewhere.   
4
If you will like to enjoy a satisfying and legit Japanese food, Shin Minori is the right place. Went for their lunch buffet. Definitely worth every cents and calories. One of the best Sashimi (Salmon and Swordfish) in town and I am always spoilt for choices for their selection of maki. Oh yeah, they serve one of the best Pumpkin Chawamushi which is a MUST try.
1
. i had been to this restaurant 2 times & I always had a good impression. But this time round I simply feel like I am not welcomed. i had made reservation for 1.30pm. last order is at 2pm, & closes at 2.30pm. when I reach at 1.45pm, your staff said last order in 8mins? Ok fine, I agreed & walked in with the lady. While the lady was showing me to the table, she commented "why can't you come another day? " "why don't I come another day"? Fine I won't come again. The price of your buffet is not cheap & this is the kind of customer service you are giving. Please reflect on your service.
4
Food and Service are good. Can go try again with non buffet menu. Portion is good enough. Drinks can include in the buffet price will be excellent.
4
Good food 3rd visit ,will visit again soon .
Just that the light are a bit to dim for elder as they can't see the food on the menu
4
Very worth it if you can eat a lot of sashimi. Quality of food was good. Produce used were all very fresh.
4
Service was good and prompt, service staff was attentive and empty plates were cleared from table within seconds.
4
The sashimi was good and generous. Pretty good value for money. Use with the Entertainer app to get good discount.
5
Fresh sashimi & lots of food varieties to choose from.. Service was quite prompt..A good place for everyone..
4
Sashimi was good, better than the grilled fare. Service was alright, ambience was nice. Packed during the weekend.
4
birthday voucher redemption was a breeze for my hubby's birthday which falls on a weekday. Food was served very fast upon ordering. Food standard is still as good. Worthwhile the price for their buffet.
4
Service was a little slow but overall good.
Food quality was good but they missed a few orders as the tablet ordering system keeps disconnecting & its not very user friendly.
3
Booked a table for 2 on a Friday night. Food choice was alright with a mix of sashimi / sushi and yakitori / grilled items. Generally portions were ok but food quality was really average. The sashimi didnt taste particularly fresh and it was hard to finish some of the items
5
Value for money fresh sashimi...with their 1 for 1 promotion...how I wish they can launch another soon!
5
Good variety of choices. The food was fresh and the service was fast. Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for quality no fuss Japanese food.
2
Waited very long for food to be served. Slow service the moment it got crowded. Had to cancel all remaining orders as the wait was too long! Sat at a corner with wooden panels as surrounding, the wooden panels were mouldy and dirty.
4
Visit on Sunday evening, nice environment with good food. BBQ food abit salty. Should have more variety on salad
5
Excellent quality of food which is fresh. The sashimi melts in the mouth for to its freshness. Staff are also courteous.
5
No gimmicks! I redeemed the birthday voucher advertised at Facebook.
The food were served fresh and right temperature.
Had a great and full lunch at Shin Minori on my birthday!
5
Booking was confirm with ease using Chope app. Food was ordered thru tablet menu. Service was very prompt. Food served was in excellent quality.
3
Extensive selection available for the buffet lunch. Can try lots of items as single serving is usually one pc. Sashimi are fresh. Overall food are not bad. Do note that the buffet does not include drinks. However, the attitude of the waitresses and waiters, especially one of the waitresses, really need lots of improvement. When I told one waitress that they gave me a bowl of rice which i didn't order, she keeps repeating its "Gohan" and insisted that i had ordered it before turning her back and walk away. I need to get their attention again (as i really do not want to eat a bowl of rice!) and this particular waitress walk to my table with her sullen face, upon checking my order list, realized that she had made a mistake, just took the rice away, turn her back and walk off without apologizing. Plain rude!!! In fact they had orders mixed up several time. Most of the time, the waitresses and waiters are standing there talking loudly without any regards to the customers around them
5
Visited the restaurant with the birthday month voucher. Food is ordered through the computer system. They are served fast and hot. As it was a weekday, it was less crowded than expected. Good quality food and is value for money as we (two of us) only paid for one diner
1
I patronised this restaurant on 28th May Sunday together with four of my friends for lunch buffet. It was our 1st visit, the experience is bad. Waiter & waitress include cashier ' atttiude is terrible. No customer's sense. It is not that they are shortage of staff, they simply has no initiative, no customer's focus.We have to request several times to refill our cups. We have to walk to counter to pay the bill & queue while the waiter & cashier continue with their chit chatting. After payment, no acknowledgement no thank you. Never expect such lousy service & attitude in this Japanese restaurant, no matter how goood the food is, poor service will put customer off. The past rating of excellence is in the past.
5
Lots of variety of Japanese food, ordered through a tablet. Shashimi was delicious, and there's a wide range of Japanese food. Tepanyaki take quite long to come, as there is clearly a shortage of staff.
4
The food was excellent. With the self ordering system, it was much easier to manage the ordering and the food was served fast. The dessert and drink were not included in the buffet.
3
The cuts can be better. The taste is average. It was quiet on a Saturday during lunch time, so this is not a bad place to bring children.
5
Feels the same since we came in 2012. Definitely much improved order taking system which is fully automated!
Food definitely improved!
5
It's very pleasure to have a small gather with my friends when public holiday and the environment was the just too cozy to enjoy our meals.
3
Decent food but not the most memorable japanese buffet in Singapore. The portion sizes for the hot food were huge, which was rather odd given that this is an ala carte buffet. Service was extremely quick and waitresses were generally very helpful.
2
the shop closes at 10pm, last order at 9.30pm. we made reservation for 8.15pm which is the earliest time slot possible for online booking so not left much time to really enjoy (we ordered the buffet btw, this is BEFORE they told us the last order time). everything was frantic and rushing to order as much as we could then at 9.45pm they started to shut down everything. Although they didn't tell us to leave but we got the idea. Its one of the worst experience we ever had in this type of restaurant. about half of the choices of sashimi has a bit of sour taste, might be due to exposed to room temperature for too long, all the cooked food was covered in MSG, u WILL get very thirsty and have to BUY more drinks even if u are having buffet (yes, it's pathetic, its supposed to be all u can eat but not all u can drink, even tea is not FOC). Do NOT come here no matter what
4
If there's any place I religiously frequent for fresh sashimi it's Shin Minori. I have been visiting this eatery for over 2 years, and it's probably one of the few Japanese restaurants that stick to their standards. Never once had I eaten a badly prepared dish. I have taken a counter seat before and seen the chefs work their crafts. Very dedicated individuals. But like every other no one place is perfect. I think their customer service (from the waiters / waitresses) leaves much to be desired, often not getting the correct orders, and rather clumsy. Their ordering system (the use of mobile devices) is not very fluid either, having experienced network failure and app crashes occasionally. That being said, still quite worth the buck if you are on the Mission to find good sashimi. Rest of the food is good too.
1
Variety of food - satisfactoryTaste of food - below averageCustomer service - horrendousThe waiters and waitresses were making loud and weird noises, like woofing or barking noises. And we closed the tatami room doors and they opened it again and showed us black face. Like they are very frustrated as they have to wait for us to finish our food. They have to get this right - it's a buffet!!!!!
4
Good variety and the sashimi was wonderfully fresh and succulent! Great value for money! Only letdown was the online ordering system as it did not capture our initial order though a message prompting 'order sent' was seen. We were left waiting for quite a while and upon checking with one of the staff, was told that they did not receive the order and we had to key in our orders again. Also, our request for refill of our plain water was left attended and we had to request again. In the end, one staff just came and left a tumbler of water on our table
5
Love the food fresh sashimi n othernvarieties. Its been uncountable times since i return to this place. This time i brought6 friends along. All had gd review!
2
Quality of food is below average.
Service not to standard. Overall, disappointment for my friends and I.
4
Restaurant is at UE square. The buffet has plenty of varieties, and in small size offering. You could add ala-cart if you wish to try others.
2
Even the Chef preparing food there were chatting away without any mask on, hence is rather unhygienic? Was there a few years back , the service was far better than now.
4
This place never fail to delight with their wide menu selection and super fast service. Go for the ala-carte buffet and eat till your fill. The portion served are reasonable and the quality of the dishes are good. Really good value for money.
5
Sashimi was fresh. Enjoyed the variety too. Though busy, staff
were polite and tried their best to tend to our requests. Enjoyed our dining experience there. :)
3
The variety is huge with good range of raw and cooked food. Overall the quality of food is quite good. However I was disappointed the buffet does not come with drink and dessert.

The service standard can be improved; some members of the service crew could have been more warm instead of just going about with their jobs. It is a Japanese restaurant after all.
4
Came for the a la carte buffet. Lots of items on the menu to choose from, although unlikely to sample them all. Casual and comfortable atmosphere too.I liked the quail egg alot and their chicken was done well. The sashimi was a bit of a let down as the swordfish was slightly hard, not very sure why. If I had more lunch time I would definitely want to try other portions of the menu
3
I read a review on this restaurant so naturally I had my expectations/hopes up. The sashimi was nice and fresh but the items fell below expectation. Thankfully I had the birthday voucher, otherwise I would feel it was not worth the money per pax. I was given a $10 voucher for the next visit but I doubt I will return
5
Great location and the food was very nice. Service was fast and pleasant too!
It was a great place to enjoy a super nice lunch and to talk business which we did. I would definately recommend this place to others!
4
Good food, reasonable price for sushi buffet. Will go back again but place is far from MRT. Coming Fort Canning MRT though.
4
It was actually my second time eating their buffet and I still enjoyed it! However it was more crowded so maybe service was a little slow and sometimes they forgot our requests. But food was still served hot and would definitely return!
4
good and attentive service! loved the food there, some hits and misses, but was quite worth it :)
will come bk again
4
1st time trying this restaurant. Food & price reasonable. Speed to service was very good especially for buffets.
3
Good sashimi quality for the price but that's it. Everything else was average. So just order the sashimi if that's your thing.
5
Service is ok, not very slow, food taste 👍🏻. Great varieties . Definitely worth the money.
Have been here a few times, worth to come back again!
4
The food was very fresh and variety was good. Pretty good value for money. Will definitely return again.
3
Went there with friends for a birthday celebration, had high expectations as we read some good reviews and it was our first time there. The food was average, some of the sashimi were cut into uneven thickness, the fish also wasn't very fresh. The service was slow but understandable as the place was filled. Price is abit steep for the quality of service and food that was provided
2
I was very disappointed at the very least. Fresh sashimi was what attracted me to the buffet but it certainly wasn't very fresh. The tuna was fishy and the other sashimi was average at best. The cooked food and grilled items, I didn't even order twice and I usually really love grilled items. The best items were the chawanmushi (very silky) and the mini soft shell crabs. Went there on a 1 for 1 special deal but wouldn't go for a similar offer
4
Overall is good and clean. Food are served quite fast! Staff are friendly and polite too. Will return back again for gathering and lunch or dinner buffet!
4
Impressed with the wide variety of choices at their ala carte buffet. Glad that they serve single portions as well to reduce food wastage yet allow one to taste as many dishes as possible! Service was very prompt too.
5
Shin minori never fail me in terms of food quality and service.
With the new dish introduced, it gives the menu even more choice and makes me want to come more !
4
The sashimi was fresh and food was served promptly. There is a quite a wide selection of food items as well. But the sofa seating placement may be too near to each other with other guests.
4
Food was good and fresh. Staff were attentive to arriving guests. Food was good - really recommend the fresh sashimi!
3
Mediocre food but there was birthday month promotion. It costs about 50++ for 2 person with the promotion. They charge for green tea separately too.
4
Quality of food is good with a wide range of uncooked and Cooked food. However location is out of the way and a long walk from Clark Quay mrt station.
4
Food was fresh and varieties of food was great! Space was abit small though. Atmosphere was very cozy but tables are quite near to one another.
5
Was able to try a great variety of Japanese dishes. All of the dishes I tried were delectable :) Service could be quicker though, as much time was spent waiting.
5
Very decently - priced Japanese buffet. Most of the dishes are very tasty, the sashimi are pretty fresh. Would definitely be back for more.My only qualm is the small confined seating space for two. If you are of a Bigger built, you will get really uncomfortable
4
Location is not the most accessible, but the food standard is good. There were also a wide variety of food on the buffet menu. It was my second visit and the standard is quite consistent.
3
All drinks are chargeable includes non alcoholic drinks and there is no dessert or fruits too. Ika sashimi cut too thick.
3
food is average and seafood is not very fresh. Staff were friendly though and the general ambiance is cozy.
4
The place is clean and tidy.
Tons of different food to choose from.
All of them are delicious to boot!
but the tablet of which to order the menu from often crashed :(
3
The food standard dropped since the last we went last year. The service of the staff was also not up to standard.
5
Nice ambience and the food menu was fantastic. There a magician that entertain us while we having our meal. Overall its a good place to wind down n chill over good food n drinks
5
Not our first time. Food was very tasty. Sashimi was very fresh. Alcohol was good. There was a magician going table to table on the fast we went. He was great as well. Will be back.
4
Sashimi is fresh,
There is enough items on the menu for kids!
Generally satisfied and service is OK!
Will definitely be back!
3
The tablet to order food keep hanging a few times. Thankfully the waiter agree to take our order. When I rang to book, they told me there still 1-1 promotion for lunch using UOB. I wrote remarks on my online booking after my call, they should call me to explain if the promotion has ended before the actual dining date. We ended up paying for 4, 1 free. Promotions should be listed on website so it's clear. A bit disappointed
2
Went on my actual birthday, because they have birthday offer with min 2 person going. We went for lunch buffet, with sashimi, yakitori, soup, side dishes, and rice noodles. Their portion is very very small, and a bit salty for yakitori. Expect for salmon sashimi, I don't think anything that I've ordered was nice. Ended up, my friend paid more than 40 for that meal, even they gave us a 10 dollar voucher, but I will never want to visit this restaurant again for below average food.
5
Fresh sashimi and awesome sushi! Rest of the items are nice as well. Worth especially since it is 1 for 1.
5
There's a great promotion during the birthday month and the food was really good! service was really good too :)
5
This is our go-to place for japanese buffet as they make sure to be consistent in the quality of food despite it being a buffet.
3
I was not blown away by this place... but it was convenient and close to our hotel...
It was fine as a fast and good solution...
4
The only thing missing was the inclusion of non-alcoholic drinks & a dessert in the Buffet price. However, that way, at least we got to sample even more of the lovely variety of items available.😊
5
The sashimi was cut very evenly and the texture of the fishes were unreal. I loved how fresh all the fish tasted. The grilled alacarte dishes were very delicious too.
5
Really recommended! The sashimi is fresh, the food selection are wide. And very tasty! I will recommend this to my friends.
4
As a show of appreciation for customers patronage, they're treating birthday celebrants to ala carte buffet lunch within their birthday month accompanied by at least one paying companion. And what a treat it was! You choose & tap your desired dishes from a tablet and with just a short wait after sending your order, food is served. Want more? Then tap tap tap again. As long as you don't waste food. Service was quick. The food quality was very good with really fresh sashimi & other ingredients. Beautifully plated. One improvement needed though is to train the staff to be more hospitable. It's fine even if they do not smile for as long as they do not sulk as well hehe. Anyway, why are they looking sullen? Maybe they need some positive incentives. Just saying.
2
Inflexible iPad ordering device, difficult to use because it was fixed on to the wall. No wifi - although the signal is strong but it was not available to diners. Sashimi was not fresh, just edible. other dishes are mostly average in taste. Tight table arrangements.
1
Came around 9pm with 2 friends and started to order a few dishes. We knew we could order more later so we didn't order too much. And around 9:30pm a waiter came to us to tell us it was time to make the last order. So we did and order all what we expected to eat at once. Dishes started to come and then it stopped. So we asked the waiter where were the pending items. He replied that there was nothing else. We ended up with a bill of 150 sgd for 3 (no drinks) for 5 makis/sushis each. Well, that makes the most expensive sushi I ever had..The worst is that they asked us to pay before we discovered that they cancelled most of our order. And there was no refund possible - even if one of my friend had only one miso soup. The manager even told me that I will have a rebate next time but she didn't even write my name - that's just cynicism.About the food, don't expect too much. It's a Buffet so you won't get the best fish nor the best part of it. They were out of stock of their premium fatty salmon. The sashimis slices were so thick that they were hardly eatable.Definitely one of my worst sushi experience in Singapore
5
Food was great. It is my 2nd time there for their buffet. Love their sashimi platter! Would definitely go there again in future.
5
Food excellent as always. All is perfect. Except one order of mine (grilled wings) were forgotten . :(
3
Food was good. only thing was the service. the staffs took a few wrong orders from our table without telling us. And I realized when we ordered something from the staffs, they don't reply anything... zzzzzzz
4
Good deal but a complicated system of ordering too often fails but the food is nice and if you choose well and estimate well it is a lot of food/ sushi and other normally expensive items for good value
4
Good for sashimi lovers who go for the buffet, good range of choices for the buffet. Would be perfect if certain dessert and green tea included in the buffet menu.
4
Not bad. Food was fresh. Been there a few times. Overall satisfied with food and service. Slightly pricey.
5
The food served were fresh and the service was very good. The place is nice and staffs were friendly. Will recommend visiting this place.
5
Trust me when I say I am an avid jap buffet fan. Visited most of the popular jap buffets in singapore and I always find myself coming back to Shin Minori. I love the really great variety of food Shin Minori has to offer and also the freshness of their sashimi and really quick service! They have never missed out a single item on our order as everything was really systematic. In most other japanese buffet restaurants, you have to manually order with the waiter while at SM, you simply order through the ipad reserved for each table. My most recent visit was in May 2017 and I must say I am pleasantly surprised the quality and standard of their food has remained the same (or even better now) compared to my last visit in 2016. I had to ask for several things during the meal such as an extra pair of chopstick and wasabi and despite it being a busy friday dinner time, the staff got me my stuff under less than 5 minutes. Their service here is simply the best
4
My 4th time dining at Shin Minori. Had a birthday voucher to redeem which was equivalent to a 1-for-1 deal - very value for money. Buffet menu was extensive with a lot of variety to choose from. Was impressed with the improved service as compared to what I had experienced in my previous visits. Seemed to have more service staff now too. They were attentive and had good initiative. Prompt to serve up dishes, clear empty plates from our table and refill our glasses. Food was fresh. Overall standard was good. Only gripe was that quite a number of dishes (esp. the fried and grilled ones) were under-seasoned and therefore tasted quite bland which was fine as it just meant we were consuming less sodium - healthier! Will definitely be back whenever the sashimi craving kicks in
2
We went there on a fri night, restaurant was busy and they were probably under staffed. Variety and sashimi was ok. I also had the cooked salmon with egg gravy, which my friend tried a little- she did mention it tasted not fresh but I ate it all. 30mins after we left, I vomited out all the cooked salmon and eggs. Imo, the raw stuff are ok.. but the meat they use for their cooked food varieties might not be that fresh (they might feel they are cooking it anyway to kill the bateria) Bad first experience and wil not go back
5
Wide selection of both cooked Japanese and raw (Sushi/sashimi) offerings. The seaweed salad is a must try. Me and my friend had double helpings, he had triple.
5
Please have more discounts so I can bring more people! :D thanks for your hard work though, there were a few people so you had to make sure you were fast
3
Staffs do not bother to welcome us to the restaurant and even when we are leaving after making the payment. Their service is really bad.
3
Sashimi was great! We ordered three plates by the end of our dinner. Various other items ok - cold ramen, edamame, sushi, chawinmushi. Service was quick. It's quite pricey for an average place.
5
Loved the sashimi offered at the restaurant, but will not recommend any of their beef dishes. $39.90++ for a lunch buffet, worth it!
5
This place has never fail to disappoint me. The standard of the sashimi and cooked food (e.g bean sprouts) has maintained over the years.
1
Food is too salty!! Food ordering system is slow. Service is slow! Location isn't ideal although parking is easy!
3
I suppose it's attempting to follow a very autonomous serving idea, but we prefer a little more service. Walking into the restaurant, a server motioned us over to a table, we sat down and didn't get a single acknowledgment afterwards. All food and drinks were ordered on an iPad, and once prepared, dropped off without a word again. Food was decent, but not enough to make me want to go back
5
Service was polite and efficient. Food was good. The dining party enjoyed all the dishes ordered and we have decided to make this restaurant our go-to Japanese Ala carte buffet resto. Says a lot since we live in the Northeast and our weekly Japanese go-to wAs in the East
4
Other than the onigiri, everything else is nice. Would recommend others to come and try at least once for their buffet. The only drawback is that the price doesn't include drinks or dessert. It would be perfect if both of that are included in the menu buffet. The staff were helpful and food came out fast. Perfect place for japanese buffet once in a while
3
Back after many years, quality and standard remains consistent. Good value for money with decent diverse selection. Service was below par (many wait staff were unable to speak English).
5
really enjoyed the spread at shin miori.
although it would have been better if we could get more ipads for ordering.
but food was on point.
3
Did not have very high expectation for this place due to all the bad reviews that I have came across. However, after dining there, realized it's not that bad? Service was ok, food was good. Value for money actually.
4
Huge selection but undeniably average. Ordering tablets need more improvement in its connectivity. Standard sashimi spread with a small selection of skewers and bbq.
3
Chope was easy to use but the food is normal tasting only. Ambience is okay but the table is abit small to put all buffet stuff
5
Many varieties of Japanese food to titillate the taste buds, fresh especially sushi sashimi, orders were accurate, food was tasty and service was reasonably fast. Reservation is a need
4
Very good variety of food and good quality. Food was delicious as always and good sake recommendation by the female manager.
5
Came in for team lunch and lunch service was excellent (similar to dinner which i had awhile back). Only issue is that serving sizes can be erratic, some of the food was served in way too huge portions for the amount we ordered (not sure if it was my colleagues fault for ordering too much). Overall tasty food and good service at a reasonable price
2
Food was not as good, service as well... My whole family wasnt expected it to be like this and they are very unsatisfying with it... Funny thing was: if the restaurant's last order was 2pm... den it should inform us earlier when we booked or stated at the website or voucher... so that we will not book the timing for 2pm...
5
Decide to have sashimi few days before the actual day. Used the Chope app and easily booked a reservation using the app. We were served promptly at the restaurant. Wait time for food was decent despite the restaurant was packed. The only problem we faced was the tablet that was used to order food keep hanging. Have to restart the app many times. The food list we ordered went missing a few time and we have to choose again. Hope they can solve the app issues.
4
The sashimi was fresh and tasted really good. Many selections of food which was great.
However, drinks were not included in the buffet (not even plain water) despite the buffet was almost $50/pax (after taxes).
4
It was crowded for a weekday lunch. I like that the food comes piping hot and the sashimi was fresh. And they serve swordfish sashimi too which many places do not serve for buffet. Dessert cake was a disappointment though as it was served frozen.
5
good service but food was served rather slower than usual but maybe because it was full house :-) sashimi was not as fresh as before for this visit but will come back again!
4
Good spread for buffet. Sashimi was fresh and generous. Food quality above average.Really enjoyed our dinner there
3
Nothing spectacular especially the drinks pricing make up for the discounts they give for the foods.
2
I booked dinner and paid about $106 for Jap buffet for 2pax. Firstly service was quite slow, given the fully packed restaurant. The cooked food was very average, and we didn't order more than we usually would have. The portions of cooked food was a little off, some came in just one piece, but some was too big a portion even for 2 pax, just like the kimichi bean sprouts dish. The sashimi was thickly sliced and seemed to be out of the fridge for awhile. But to be fair, it wasn't not fresh, but definitely not my idea of fresh sashimi just out from the fridge. We had 2 wrong orders given amidst the overwhelming crowd. Overall okay experience, but will not return for awhile.
5
It's definitely a great place to dine in with friends or family. Unexpectedly fresh sashimi served. Love the perfect grilled yakitori especially the garlic pork skewer and shiitake mushroom! Tempura were fried just perfect and dip together with the sauce. Highly recommend to other people for celebrating occasions like birthday or family and friends gathering. For sure I'll visit Shin Minori Restaurant again!
4
Went there with my husband and my kids using Facebook Birthday 1-for-1 promo.Children below 5 years old can dine free there! :)Food is good, fresh and servings are just nice.Personally recommend their yakimono and pumpkin chawanmushiTheir sashimi is very fresh, esp Tuna and Salmon belly!Currently they have other on-going promotions, so do check out their Facebook/website for more information.Will definitely go back again :
4
It's perfect for every occasion from birthday celebrations, farewells to festivities, or no special day actually but you just need a good food at a great price! Lovely place for yakitori & sashimi especially. Needs to work on their ordering&serving though. Ive patronised them at least once every two months and their ordering system either hangs or the order was submitted but kitchen didnt receive it. Also, once the order is sent, it doesnt get recorded on the list, so no way to track your orders. Just 2 days ago, we ended up waiting 20mins for an order which we eventually got them to check with the kitchen but they insisted there werent any orders left for the table - and we had no way to prove. I'll bring a pen and paper next time to track my orders, but I'll return for sure.
3
Went there with great expectations after seeing the place win some awards on reservation sites, went away feeling underwhelmed.Many of the dishes tried were average at best, and lack even the closeness to japanese food flavours one can regularly find at places like Keyaki, or even at Chako and Hakata (previously at Hong Leong Gardens).For eg. Chicken teppan came pretty hard to chew and had a gooey sweet taste to it, which was quite odd; Ebi tempura came rather limp and bland while the accompanying dip was tasteless, unlike the very light but aromatic dip, one usually would expect. Gyuniku Shogayaki was good, though the flavour resembles more a cze char dish than a japanese itamemonoThe sashimi were good, clean and fresh tasting, so are the sushi and temaki. Well-made, standard fares, so those would be the standouts in the restaurant.Entertainer app can be used for PH eve, however some of the staff were unaware of this, but eventually the correct processing was done, so customer may need to be more in tune with the promotions on offer instead of relying only on the service crew.Pretty packed on a noisy Saturday afternoon, so no ambience to speak of.For the sheer variety, the price is very decent at $40+
4
Sashimi is fresh and the service was prompt. Cooked dishes were okay. No wastage charges and no time limit for the buffet, making this a value for money choice.
3
Good service. Food selection was average. Sashimi quality wasn't very good. The cold Soba was tasteless.
5
Ambience is good and service is timely. Staff serve with timeliness and with a smile. Food quality is fresh and good
4
I love their sashimi! It's fresh and tasty. And their grilled salmon is delicious Too! However it would be more awesome if their drinks is included in the buffet. Overall it's awesome!
4
Premium buffet standard since the menu is ala carte so all the food is prepared when you order it. But be prepared to wait a while for the food to arrive.
5
Had the Japanese a la carte buffet. Sashimi was fresh, good selection of food to choose from, prompt service. Only wish the lighting there was better as it was too dark for my liking.
1
Horrible attitudes of staff and even the branch manager. Refused to let us change table even though 90% of the tables were not used for the rest of the evening. When asked what buffet includes, service staff says "Everything" but in fact it only includes what is listed under buffet tab. when asking the female branch manager(?) questions, she wasn't even facing us when she answered, and worse, answered in an agitated tone. Honestly worst experience ever in a restaurant. Felt like a kopitiam standard
3
Second time visiting the restaurant. Unfortunately the staff was very busy during the lunch buffet and did not manage to attend to us calling them for help. It took a while for the staff to respond. Otherwise, the food was of reasonable quality for the price paid and it had a good ambience as well. Will consider returning to this place
1
The price is overly pricey for the quality of food they serve. On top of that, even though it's a buffet, you got to wait for them to serve you. Waiting time for the dishes is very very long. For $40 per pax, it's really not worth your money and time visiting this place. This is an honest review.
4
Food was good but service was abit slow probably due to the restaurant being super packed. Buffet was not the self-service kind but we had to order from an iPad then they would serve us but the food took really long to come. Nonetheless, still alot of variety to choose from!
4
Most of the food are not bad. Sashimi are cold enough. The staff cleared the plate very fast after you finish eating.
4
Foods are good but order is a little too slow.
Moreover, some order was not serve unless re-order and that menu come in double.
4
enjoyed the buffet dinner, especially the fresh spread of sashimi . the cooked food like yakitori items , special sushi rolls are highly recommended as well
3
Food was ok. But there was a big group of student booking making the place like market area, my friends and I cannot even talk or hear clearly.
4
Food quality has improved greatly since our last visit one year ago. And it continues to be great value for money with the birthday one-for-one a la carte buffet lunch promotion on weekdays.
4
Nice staff. Fuss free reservation. Food option is good but can include more variety of beef. Temaki needs improvement
5
Huge variety of food. The food were prepared upon order instead of taking straight from preset counters. Fresh!
4
I was pleased with the selection n quality but the service of one of the staff was bad on both times i went. He was in all black so i presume he would be a supervisor but his attitude when he served was terrible.. clanging the plates on our table and rushing to clear our plates when we still had food!
3
We (family/relatives) decided to try this place out for my birthday. Since we had 10 or 11 people, they gave us a private room. Since this was an ala carte buffet, ordering was done through a tablet. We had to ask for another tablet as 11 people sharing 1 tablet was just ridiculous. Drinks are not included in the buffet, so take note. Service was quite slow. Some of the items we ordered took more than 30 minutes to arrive!Though the buffet was extremely affordable (considering it was serving Japanese cuisine and it was a dinner buffet), the quality of the dishes were not up to standard. The sashimi was relatively fresh. The salmon handroll I ordered was pathetic, there was only a small piece of salmon inside the handroll. (as shown in the photo) The spring rolls were super thin.Overall, I would not recommend coming here if you are picky about the quality of food
4
We had gone for the lunch buffet. Reservations were a breeze with the Chope app. The place was easy to find and we were settled pretty quickly to our seats. Ordering was via a tablet. The quality of food was very good and fresh. However, one of our last orders never made it to our table but that was fine since we were too stuffed by then..
1
Bad food, bad service, terrible coordination between delivery orders and live orders. Waiters did not speak English.
4
The slices of sashimi were very generous, and the tsukune meat balls, asparagus bacon, gyuniku shogayaki are recommended. Please do go try them yourself.
5
Love it's fresh sashimi, wide varieties of Maki, sushi, soup and chawanmushi. This is the second time we have visited the restaurant. Will definitely recommend it to our friends and other family members.
4
good mood and good food, but it was served too slowly.we had to wait for long time...if it improve, i will visit again.
4
Food is good. Sevice is a bit slow hope can be improved. Overall i will rate the food experience as very good. I will visit the restsurant again.
3
Drinks not inclusive, per pax is $45 after all the miscellaneous charges, not worth for the limited variety of food choices available for buffet. Food not as fantastic as reviewed.
4
Alright for the price. 1 for 1 due to birthday voucher. Food is fresh, the variety is there, ambience so so. Staff v cold, could put on a smile
4
Food was average but there's plenty of variety. Sashimi was good and worth for the buffet price. Will recommend for a once-off visit.
4
With lots of variety of food. The food is delicious. But some of the tables are too close to each other, make one of my friend feel uncomfortable.
5
Tucked away inside UE Mall, you could miss this place if you didn't know about it. You have to reserve a table as the place gets really busy. For around S$47 you get a buffet choice of over 100 items! This is incredible value and you can order as much as you can. Desserts are charged separately. The food items are made to order, so you don't pick from a stale buffet table. You order on their tablet and very swiftly the food will start to arrive. We're not fans of cold tofu, so that item was a miss for us. But everything else was really good. I was actually really surprised at the price because this is a quality restaurant in a nice location, service is impeccable and the food delicious. A must try for any fans of Japanese food.
4
value for money and there is a wide selection of food, gd to visit. drinks however are not included in the buffet price..
5
There is a wide variety of food. Service is fast in serving the food and they are fresh and delicious too!
3
For sashimi, the swordfish and salmon were good. The cuts were too thick. The tuna was inedible cos it was about an inch thick. Rest of menu was okay. The tempura batter a bit thick.
5
We had a good time during the aka carte buffet. Since it's their 10th anniversary, they had a magician performing at our desk. Wonderful! Loved the magic show... we had a great time
4
Very decent priced buffet. Have to make reservations to avoid the wait. Good quality given the price. Recommend to try.
5
Really nice and comfortable environment. The staffs were very friendly and explain the details to us as we were first time there. Food was served quite quickly and it taste superb!
4
Food was gd, took awhile for food to be served though just a few tables during a weekday lunch. Overall experience was good. Will come back again.
5
We loved it! The fish was fresh and the kimchi beansprout noodle dish (whose name is escaping me) was out of this world. Service was prompt and friendly. Bought a Chope voucher so I saved 10%!
4
We had buffet at Shin Minori on April 8, to take advantage of the OCBC three-for-one promotion. It was very good, as usual, though we enjoyed our visit three weeks earlier more. That could be because we had not had sushi/sashimi for a long time. The sashimi was very fresh and we enjoyed the moriwase before we restricted ourselves to salmon and octopus. The salmon was well marbled, but we did not manage to get a morsel of the salmon belly on our second visit (maybe that was why we enjoyed our first visit more!!). Looking forward to our next visit, but after a time lapse, of course. Meanwhile, we cannot wait to eat Gayatri's (Race Course Road) yummy fish-head curry!!! I usually tarpow
3
Food was not bad but some of our orders didn't come. The waiter also mixed up our orders with the table beside. We had to exchange our food after relizing our food went to next table and theirs are on our table. The place is quite cramp. Wouldn't come back if there's no promo as it's quite pricey.
5
Most worthwhile place to have great sashimi buffet. We went with 6 pax. All enjoyed the food. Highly recommended
4
Good variety food of high quality. Each portion is just nice for 2 so we can go for wide variety! Would come back again!
4
Food quality is good however waiting time for food is a little long.
Used entertainer app for 1 for 1 however cashier missed out and charged the original price until we pointed out to them.
5
Reservation was confirmed with several automated calls. This should be complemented with email confirmation as the calls were sometimes made at times that I was unavailable
4
Good food and service, but staff appeared overwhelmed by the manpower shortage. Frequency of receiving out orders was also a little inconsistent.
5
The food is delicious and they have a wide selections for their buffet. Their service is fast too. Will go back again!
3
Celebrated my friend birthday there last week. The birthday girl commented the 1st & 2nd batch of sashimi served is with different quality and she is quite dissappointed. Seated near to the live kitchen so the conversation, giggling and comments between kitchen & service staff can be annoying and disturbing. Overall, the whole experience is still good and i look forward to see more improvement in future..... so GAMBATTE!
4
My 2nd time here.This place is quite hard to get to from train station. But I prefer to walk from Clarke Quay MRT station which will probably take about 15 mins walk. For tourist best is just to take a taxi, grab car or Uber. Location is at UE Square. Food generally are good. But do expect some waiting time during weekends as usually it will be packed with diners. Best to make reservations to avoid disappointment. Service staffs are friendly. So far so good. Price for buffet is at about SGD 50.
2
Went there with birthday 1for1 promo. Since it's ala-cart buffet, we need to wait till they serve us our order. Table was too small, orders came in quite slow, plates were not cleared until we asked them to. The food quality was not bad, but it's only worth it because it's 1-for-1. for full price $44, will never go back again.
1
Bad service: Food took an extremely long time to arrive on our table for the very little amount of food we have ordered. When we need someone to attend to us to refill our tea pot, we have to press more than 6 times on the tablet and no one attended to us. We have to go to the service staff directly (none was around our section) to get it refilled. Food: Sashimi was fresh and good. Yakitori are too hard/tough for comfortable chewing. The serving were miserable. We ordered bacon wrapped with asparagus and the serving is so small.
4
Quality of food good, fresh and yummy & service provided is prompt too. Except for orders of tempura which took longer time to be served to us.
5
The atmosphere at Shin Minori is cosy and comfortable. The food arrives promptly and the staff ensures that you are never neglected. Food is great and we regret not eating more sashimi. Overall fantastic
4
Went for alacarte buffet lunch. Food quality was decent. Sashimi was fresh. You order through an iPad so it's very convenient and no need to worry about bothering the wait staff excessively.
3
Food was ok but service was quite bad, was welcomed by the staff upon arrival quite rudely. Waiting time for food was as Long as 30minutes after 1pm.
4
for about sgd40 per pax, the selection of food is considered extensive. The quality of the sashimi is decent, especially the swordfish, and the skewers are pretty good too.
4
The Dinning was wonderful as we were usher to a smaller room. However, it was too close to the kitchen, hence it was a bit noisy.
4
The restaurant was very busy but the food came relatively fast. Good selection of Japanese food which was tasty and fresh. Will go again.
3
Food service was slow. Had to do multiple reminders to service staff for my hand rolls but it wasn't served at all. On the bright side, Sashimi cut was fresh and thick. Their grilled spread was good. Their crab croquette was nice. Point is their food was good but due to the slow service, we couldn't eat much and got tired of waiting. And once it hit 230pm, food service stopped. Surprisingly, the table on our right had all their orders even though they arrive later than us. The table on our left was surprised that table had all their orders fulfilled without any glitches yet we were left hanging on several dishes and had to remind the service staff again and again. There were guests being placed in partitioned tables with a board like in a library. Probably won't go back again during lunch time due to their lack of service
5
Shin Minori is one of my favourite go-to Jap places and since it was introduced to me three birthdays ago, I have made it a birthday special every year. This year though was the extra perk of enjoying a free birthday lunch buffet in honour of Shin Minori's 10th year anniversary! Definitely worth it(: and the lunch time service was really good!
4
Overall the dining experience as a whole was amazing but it was just the ordering of the food as well as the duration to wait for the food to arrive was pretty slow. An example was like I ordered 3 glass of ice water and it took a good 10 minutes to be send to my table. Other than that, food quality was excellent
5
i enjoyed the ambience and staff was courteous. To make the whole experience more memorable was the magician, Donavan. Very personal, fun loving and yet just timely (not too long and not too short time) for a light hearted magic show!
4
Not my first time here, but good food as usual. Sashimi seemed slightly less tasty as before, but the rest of the dishes were great.
5
Great buffet - five stars quality of spread and individual plates - for the price you are paying, shin minori is extremely worth it
5
The waiter and waitress there are very friendly and their service is good and fast. Will visit them again.
4
service and food are not bad. can give a try again. the restaurant is a little too dim though..can brighten up a little
5
Visited this place to utilise my free ala-carte lunch buffet voucher. Service was good as the waitress bothered to recommend what are the new dishes. Sashimi was fresh and tasty.
4
The food quality was good but the staff was not very responsive, which could be due to the peak period at that time. Nonetheless, this place is highly recommended for its food if you do not mind a noisy environment to dine in.
1
Terrible service. Will be my first n last visit. The service staff not responsive. Pretends to be very busy...
3
Went there with the 1-for-1 birthday promo. Price is worth it during the promo but I don't think I would pay the usual price. Food is alright, not fantastic. Sushi is pretty average. Was seated at a very cramped table when there were many empty tables around. Staff probably didn't want to walk and so seated all the customers nearby, putting us in very awkward close proximity
4
I like the a la carte buffet style which requires making our order through the tablet -- it cuts down waiting time and you can decide how big a portion you want, hence reduces food wastage. A wide range is offered, the food is of quality and served hot. It was our second time back and it didn't disappoint.
1
Variety of food is limited. Taste of food is so-so, definitely not worth the price. Will not go again. With that lunch pricing, I can get a better Japanese restaurant and better food.
4
Wide variety for a buffet, fresh food and sashimi. Overall recommended if you have some bank promotion.
2
We are thirsty after eating the food. No doubt it is delicious. The waiters also serve food very slow and avoid our eyes contact when we want to order more. What an experience for ala carte ordering buffet.
3
Overall experience was ok. Atmosphere was quite decent. Waiters were quite attentive, certain portions of the food were quite small.
2
service and food quality was horrible. me and my friend had a bad stomachache after the buffet lunch.
3
I last ate years back. I went back again last week to try again. Variety was quite good, however i would rather pay slightly more and go for hotel buffets. Plain water and tea are chargeable with no desserts and fruits.
4
Reservation was made Super convenient with chope, email confirmation was very helpful. Food was good, service prompt. Recommend.
5
My family's favourite choice when it comes to Japenese buffet. The free flow of fresh shashimi is a constant draw.
5
Made reservation through Chope for 5 pax & was promptly ushered in. Food quality was good, service was promp. Although it took a while for the orders to arrive, I felt it was understandable given the full capacity crowd. . Overall we felt it was value for money
4
We were looking for a buffet place that features Japanese dishes, and decided to try this place after reading other positive reviews.The place was apparently quite popular, as it got crowded quickly.They offer either a la carte or buffet here. You basically order your food using electronic tablets available at each table. The menu on the tablet shows not just names of the dishes but also pictures, serving size (which allows you to know how much of each dish you are actually getting), and explains what each dish was. Basically, you select the dish that you want, indicate the portions, add it to the order, and click send. The process was quite simple and smooth.In general, orders arrive soon after we submitted them; mostly within about 2-3 minutes. Some dishes though, might take longer. For reasons we could not figure out, our orders of gyoza took more than 30 minutes to arrive!Sometimes they do miss an order, and you have to check with them. We had dishes that didn't show up until we asked them about it. So diners will have to keep tab on what's been served and what's yet to be served.We found the sashimi and sushi to be fresh, and the food were tasty.One disappointing issue was that drinks were not included in the buffet; not even green tea or water. You have to pay for those.We found the service to be acceptable, generally prompt. Staff were also friendly.At about S$40 per person, we felt that the buffet price was reasonable, especially if you enjoy sashimi and order lots of those.Overall this was a place worth visiting
4
Good Japanese buffet with a huge variety of food available. However, it's s little pricey without promotion.
4
The online reservation was easy and convenient..I enjoyed my food and food was served efficiently..very much enjoy the offer given..thank you
4
one does not go to a japanese buffet for unlimited chawanmushi or yakitori, no, one goes for sashimi. paid $44 for 2 people thanks to the entertainer and had my fill of salmon, swordfish, yellowtail and tuna. slices were thick and fresh. will be back.
5
There is a variety of fresh food! The salmon slices although thick was really good! It was an eat-all-you-can buffet and hence I felt it was very value for money!
5
The food quality is very fresh. The staff are all very friendly and alert.
Some items on the menu has recebtly changed.
Having a guest magician Donovan was a treat and a pleasant. He should be there on a regular basis.
4
like the yakimono there.
not like the normal buffet, u order then they cook.
make the taste better..
4
Skip the sushi it's only average but get your money's worth on sashimi.
Typical Japanese restaurant.
1
The staff can only converse in mandarin. Last order was made known to us at 2130hrs and closing time is 2230 but at 2200hrs their staff were all packed and waiting at main entrance to close the restaurant. Feels so unwelcomed.
3
Food was decent and staff were friendly, helpful and prompt at services. However tables were small and diners were all squeezed at one area of the restaurant, making the place squeezy and noisy not very conducive for a buffet. Aircon didn seem to be working well either
4
Food variety is great. Service of staff are average. Chope printed out Groupon was show to staff before dinning but when bill arrived no discount was shown on the bill. Got to direct staff to double check the printed Groupon was with them. Time waste on billing
3
The service was slow... We have to wait quite a while before drinks were served or to get the attention of the waiters/ waitresses to check on our missing orders. But the food served was fresh, especially the sashimi.
3
For common so so food what else can i say. Will go back for basic food. The items remain unchange. Boring items
4
Food quality is great, the shashimi is very fresh. However service at the counter can be further improved.
3
Food was serve slow during lunch time. Service with service crew is OK, but the front counter not so welcoming.
4
Quite a quiet place and food variety and taste was not bad. Had Donavan who is a magician to entertain us during dinner which was quite amazing to see him perform his magic
4
We enjoyed ourselves there! Food was prompt, and came hot and fast. Service staff was friendly and helpful
3
Was brought to the table with an attitude problem waiter. The sashimi served was sliced too thick, totally fail if you are in Japan's kitchen
4
We were placed to seat at near cashier whereas the staff and customers keep hitting against our chair. The seating arrangement is too cramp. We ordered Dragonfly Maki Roll with others however till the end of our meal this dish yet to serve to us. Overall still a good meal experience with shine minori
5
The kids felt like having Japanese so we decided to call at Shin Minori to allow them to select what they liked. Buffet was around $37 per pax and the selection variety was good. Sashimi was fresh so we had two servings. The rest of the dinner was featured with a surprise find of Takoyaki. The kids loved this street food in our recent trip to Japan. It was a key highlight of the evening!
5
The quality, portion size and everything was perfect for the both of us as we love to try everything in small portions and order the stuff we like again.. Very value for money even if we were not using the bday voucher that was sent.. Shin Minori is very customer oriented, but heads up during peak times service may be a bit slower if you are rushing for time as they have many orders to process, however the waiting times were perfect for my S.O. and I to hold conversation and short break in between courses haha
4
Very big buffet spread, all categories of jap food from sushi sashimi all the way to rice and noodles. Very value when 1-for-1 promo
4
Overall a value for money buffet with quite a large variety of cooked food.
Will definitely return in the future.
4
The place is always packed with lots of people! Went during a saturday and theres only buffet, no ordering of ala carte dishes so do take note! It's slightly crowded for it to be a dating venue so don't visit during your first date!
4
A good variety of Japanese food at a great value! Come hungry! Be sure to make a reservation as they are always full especially at dinners.
4
Value For Money , wide range of food , service was ok even during peak hour. will visit again love the cooked food super fast
4
Sashimi is fresh and portion ok, same goes for sushi and maki. The stewers portion can be improved. And more pork and beef selection will be great!
1
The Birthday treat wasnt as stated free for Birthday Customer. I was very disappointed on my Birthday n the waitress didnt vertify my NRIC just ask for e voucher n extra party then can have the free treat. Y not just put as 1 for 1 treat not Birthday treat at all
3
Overall, it was a good experience. The sashimi were fresh and the cooked dishes were average, not bad but nothing amazing about it. We went for the promotion (Free Alaska Snow Crab Nabe with every 2 paying adult for lunch buffet). Unfortunately, after 30 minutes of waiting and inquiring about the waiting time after ordering the Nabe for a couple of times, we were informed that the Alaska Snow Crab Nabe ($32) was not available, which they replaced with the Hotate Chizu Mentaiyaki (5 pcs at $22.00, but we were only given 4 pieces).However, the service staffs were cheery and friendly, which I appreciate very much
2
Food was average or even some was below average.Waiting time for each of the items ordered were at least 30-45 minutes, excluding Sashimis which took 10-15mins for a plate.The waiting time was horrible and there were people around my table asking for their food too. I ordered takoyaki balls, quail eggs, ton katsu and gyoza which took more than an hour to arrive
4
Book a table of 5 for weekend lunch. Was the first to go into the restaurant. Order some food thru the tablet. But some food never came. Notice other diner also had this problem. When we ask a few time about the order some, some dishes told were sold out. And after few rounds of checking the dishes came out. Other dishes were serve promptly. The Kani crab and toufu dishes were the ones that told 1.5 hr and was not serve despite many round of asking and checking with the staff.
4
As per other reviews, the food were all pretty yummy , especially the crunchy maki! Serving of the food was also fast
4
Food variety alot to choose from the menu, sashimi are fresh and food serve are hot. Worth to go try it!
5
Some of the food we ordered wasn't served. Very nice environment, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall the food was very good! Highly recommended!
3
Basic sashimi selection. Grilled selection was ok nothing to crow about. We also ordered soup which was a nice change from the usual miso.
4
Customers of the japanese buffet menu are spoiled for choices. The food are freshly prepared and sashimi are very fresh. Will definitely come back again.
5
The service need to be improved as well as the order being processed. A lot of customer send in their order but didn't receive the food at all and order was being cancelled. Some even send in order when they enter the restaurant but food was sent to their table at the end of their meal (where there are already full)
3
Brought hubby for the 1 for 1 Birthday ala carte buffet promotion. The staffs were friendly and nice. Responded well whenever we need help. Food were average. Due to the crowd, there were some orders which we had placed were not served. Overall nice experience if using the promotion.
2
There are varieties of food available but the quality is mediocre. If there's no birthday voucher to be used during this visit, it's not worth your effort and calories to visit this restaurant. Totally has no idea how this restaurant won the best buffet restaurant of the year.
4
The food is great but the staff are not very friendly or helpful if you are not local. Very busy so be prepared to wait for your order and book in advance, unlikely you will get in as a walk-in. Good location close to Boat Quay. Food is amazing and freshly prepared - hence the waiting times. Great value compared with Australian prices for sushi. All you can eat! Alcohol expensive. Tip - order a selection of hot and cold at same time as cold will come out faster
4
Not the first time I've been to shin minori; this is our family's go-to restaurant for Jap ala-carte buffet. A group of 4 of us went for the lunch buffet, it was pretty crowded though it was a weekday. Glad to have made the reservation on chope or we may not have been able to get a seat. Food was good, as usual, always love the sashimi which is extremely high quality, thick, fresh pieces. However, the service that day was particularly slow, though I attribute it to only 4 floor staff and thus I feel it isn't really their fault. Perhaps the management may want to look to hiring more staff for service or it is very tiring for them as well to serve continuously for hours. Other than that, shin minori doesn't disappoint and they are definitely a restaurant we will continue to visit :)
4
Second time there with friends to celebrate birthday, is a good trial for friends. If it could include some desert that will complete the meal.
4
overall the environment and food was good even ordering and foods servicing was fast. Just the sitting was not so good
5
Good value for its ala-carte Jap buffet.
Sashimi cuts were thick and juicy. One of the few that offer temajiki (swordfish) sashimi.
Good service too.
5
Good and value for money! Sashimi was fresh and the food was good as well. There's a lot of people so service may be slow. But customers will have to understand.
3
The food is nice n quite fresh. Because we are having buffet lunch,some of the food we ordered didnt come.and we order again.the service is ok too.the food delivery quite fast.
4
As the title suggests it was my second time at Shin Minori. It wasn't as crowded as the first time, but probably because it was a weekday lunch. Food was delivered promptly and I noticed the staff were friendlier this time round :)
4
Food portion such as chawanmushi & soup were reduce as compared to my previous visit some time back, the rest of items are still good.Service wise, probably due to lunch time so service wasn't so prompt, takes awhile for them to respond to our requests.Oerall, still a good dining experience
1
Beware that you need to print out the Chope voucher before you dine as there is zero empathy from the restaurant manager if you don't have the hard copy. We request if we could change seats but was turned down and lastly when we asked if drinks was included in the buffet we were told clearly that only water and green tea was free despite that they will actually charged you for it. When I asked about the charges all I received was a cunning smile that the drinks are not free but FREE FLOW
5
Found this place on the net, they have an all you can eat buffet so went on a Saturday night only to find it was booked out, our mistake so we booked for the next night. looking forward to it all day as last day in Singapore and certainly not disappointed, seated you have an ipad with menu on it and start selecting dishes and they arrive very timely some slower than others as they are made to order, from the first plate that turned up WOW, I've had plenty of Japanese here at home but this was just different and so much better in a way I cant describe as I'mnot a food critic, only had to stop as had to catch taxi to airport, if I had to find a fault the woman on reception was rather brash but didn't spoil our experience, definitely on my must things to do next time in Singapore which wont be long
2
Visited on valentines day, restaurant was crowded and couples where separated by wooden dividers. Conversations from other couples could be easily heard and there was no privacy. The food arrived extremely slow(about 20mins waiting time for 2 pieces of sushi) and we did not receive many of the food that we ordered. Moreover, we received servings of food that we did not order. Its understandable that the restaurant may have been busy that's why the food arrive late but how can we be served food that we did not order ourselves? that's hilarious. I dont mean to give a bad review to complain, I really hope shin minori can really up their service standards
4
Service was really fast but the food was not bad. The atmosphere was good and they were very friendly.
1
Horrible waiting time, food not served despite countless request, cold foods, poor quality of food although many choices. Price doesn't match quality of food expected
3
Overall, Shin Minori proves to be an extremely value-for-money buffet restaurant. Premium cuts of sashimi, together with a wide variety of delectable grilled dishes, sushis, fried dishes, maki! Most of the dishes are above average.
5
The staff sometime uhhh not responsive leh food is food as usual ummm clean and presentable all in all
5
Great choice for Japanese Buffet for any occasions. Value for money. Serves in small portions so that you can enjoy everything on the menu. Will sure come back for more.
4
Even if you are not going for sashimi, there are also lots of other good stuff like the crab soup. But of course, people go there for sashimi which is good.
4
Food is good initially. Seem the chefs are lazy or not professional. The last dish is inedible as it's big chunks of raw fish which after one mouth full. You can feel like vomit cos the raw fish juice are too much. Shall cut thinner like the initial dish out. Overall ok . Jus the last dish of sashimi standard dropped n wasted the food. How can a chef cut the raw fish into so big chunks
2
I reservation table for valentine dinner with my wife and we reach there early and they told me even i book it at 8.30pm also does not confirm have table for me. but after 8.30pm we go in and the tablet keep having problem cant order and we only have 45mins to order food all before close and service are lousy keep calling but no one is serveing and we still giving service charge of 15 dollars for nothing. asking for refill have to wait for 1hrs then refill it. ice cream is so smaller then other customer which is early came in for dinner. it is not wroth to come here for dinner with important date. my wife and i was so upset of this yr celebration.
2
Food was above average and commendable. As was the service given the entire network crashed. It took a half hour before staff efficiently managed "manually". we were impressed with how they managed the situation. The evening was a completely loss when the cleaning lady form the kitchen pushed out a trolley load of trash bags and asked me to move. I was seated and still having my dinner. I asked what she meant in disbelief and she shouted in mandarin "move away." my partner was so taken aback he stood up and insisted we leave immediately. Sadly, i did not get to finish my dinner. Not quite acceptable
4
The food was good; the sashimi fresh. The service was very slow - you order what you want through the ipad at your table - some items took a long time to arrive and others never came. There was a lot of waiting, making the overall experience less than satisfactor
4
Food served at Shin Minori is fresh and their service is fast. Sashimi sliced a little too thick. Almost double of what we get in other Japanese restaurants. I personally prefer it to be slightly thinner.
4
First visit to this place.
Since my gf and I love Jap food, we decided to try this restaurant out. The food was good and we'll back again.
4
The crowd at the restaurant was simply astounding, but service was considerable brisk and food standard was still quite good.
3
Good hangout place for get together. A good variety of food selection but average tasting for food..the food serving time was quite long due to understaffing.
5
Excellent food and service. Will definitely be visiting this restaurant again next with my family members.
3
Food quality is over rated in your review. Except for sashimi, rest of dishes were either too salty or mostly overlooked, non authentic at all
4
Very fast service and fresh food .(",)
Easy reservation
Happy overall .
Will visit soon again and thank you.
5
I should say it has quite a good selection of food for us to choose from. Sashimi was fresh which is important! Yakirori was a plus point
5
Visit the restaurant for a simple Business Lunch. Variety of food is many, taken the Buffet and feel free when placing the order without worry.
4
The buffet is value for money if it's 1-for-1 as charges for other items like drinks are over priced. The teriyaki BBQ items are a tad too sweet but salted grill are alright. The sashimi slices are thick and juicy. This is good for regular Japanese fare
4
Had a pleasant experience here celebrating my wife's birthday. Food was good except the grilled items which were burnt and overcooked. Staff were helpful and engaging but they are a little shorthanded during peak periods. Overall satisfied and will come back in future!
2
Not a very good experience for ambience. Venue quite run down. Variety of food for the price could be better
5
Lovely food and good service :)
Though they were very busy
They kept smiling and making sure we are happy . Thanks
5
Quality of the sashimi is good. Majority of the dishes are good. Overall, it's value for money as most of the items are good. They do have nice sake.
2
Utterly disappointed with the restaurant that was branded to be the best buffet restaurant in 2016. Very poor services by the waitresses with rude expressions.
3
Serve me soup but didn't provide me with a spoon. Ask for a spoon but I finished my meal already also never come. Ask for bill 3 to 4 times but still didn't come. In the end, I walk up to the counter to pay my bill.
5
Went to Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant on the 2nd Feb. Restaurant want not that busy when we entered. The reason I always patronise this restaurant is because the food and free flow and we don't have to get up from our seat. It's all ordered from a tablet which is provided on the tables. The food quality and presentation is really great. However I feel that providing wasabe for every single dish is very wasteful. Most of the times the staff had to clear my plate with the wasabe not even touched. Service staff there are average. However I feel that the managers there should take their job more seriously. Most of the time I can see them chit chatting in the back and even eating food at the back during service. When I thank them for clearing my plates they just totally ignore me. If you are looking for good food this is the place. However, don't expect any service
5
most value for money japanese buffet I had in the longest time, sashimi was thick and fresh with no fishy taste and the dishes were served hot. However, would like to feedback that clearing service could have been done faster due to space constraint of the tables.
5
The sashimi were fresh and they were generous with the portions. It's disgusting to see how other patrons just over ordered and waste the sashimi. It's definitely value for money for the sushi and sashimi. The fried stuff we're mediocre and the grilled ones are better. There is a little bit of inconsistency with the quality of the fried and grilled food but then again, it's a buffet and the chef is really busy handling the crazy amount of orders
3
The food was very good and the alarm Carter buffet electronic ordering system easy. However when the food was delivered the server just abruptly dropped the plate at the edge of the table and did not make an effort to place it between the diners. Also clearing plates after they were finished was not done in a timely manner. Nor was the free-flow tea refreshed when the glass was empty.
3
Under-staff so the wait for food took longer than expected. The food quality also suffers as a result of the situation
3
Good range of food but service was slow and not all items ordered were delivered to us despite repeated reminders. Surprised to see sashimi was cut into 1-1.5cm thick.
3
Loved the sashimi, fresh and delicious....But the cooked food was overcooked and dry. Service was okay...price is exp considering the average quality of the cooked food
3
The staff were friendly but the food quality was much lower than expected and the buffet does not even come with any drinks, not even water ... and no desserts either.. a bit disappointing ....
3
Food was not thaaat nice. Priced too highly for a single cuisine meal. Lunch was like 40 plus per person? Who would be willing to spend that much on a lunch at such a deserted mall? Price should be reduced to entice more customers
3
Nice food. Though we ordered via the system, we noted there were instances where the food did not arrive.
5
The food was fresh, and the service was not bad. Missed a few orders but since its buffet and it was crowded, it is really not an issue.
3
Visited the restaurant for the 1st time to celebrate my son's 21st birthday but was a big disappointment. The food quality are average n choices limited. Sashima quality are average as well and there are more Jap buffet we visited are of better choices and comparable in price too
3
Went to have early reunion dinner at shin minori, serving of food was kinda slow due to most probably not enough manpower for servers. Requested water refill but took quite some time to have it served to us. Few of our orders were missed out, waitress came to ask for last order and told that they left out few of our orders, went back to check but never came back and came to ask the second time for last order but we just forget about it instea
2
Was looking forward to have a value for money dinner and great company on Tuesday, 24. But was it was a total let down. Thank God the sashimi was fresh and they were generous with their servings. If you are not a sashimi fan, you may wanna give this place a miss. I must say they do have a good variety on the menu for the amount they charge, but.... the bunch of us would rather go for value and quality to variety!Most of the grilled items we ordered were so tiny and dry in texture and some of them are cold!!!! We were sooooo totally mislead by the photos in the menu. Oh ya, if you are conscious of salt intake - this is not the place for you either, their cooked food is en general to the salty side. We wanted to put in a special request but the tablet that has a remarks xolumn doesn't allow us to do so. Food came fast but the service were not up to standard. There were 8 of us with 3 tablets (it is obvious that they have linked the table to fit our number of pax) and we ordered using different tablets. To us, it's basic knowledge or only logical to serve the food to the table where the orders were keyed. But 2 of thier service staff did not do so. They just dumped the food at one side and expect us to pass on. The level of basic service should be up in this. Overall, it was a disappointment for me and it shall be my first and my last to visit this food chain.
4
This was the 1t time we dine at Shin Minori restaurant. It was recommended by my colleague. Overall food ok but serving flow was a bit slow but speed up later. Probably it was a Sunday dinner & more diners.
5
Amazing buffet, with a lot of choices eather for nigiri, sashimi, maki or even satay.
Everything is really tasty plus good quality.
My favorite spot for a japanese treat
3
generally everything was way too sweet.. the good things are you could order by precise pieces so can reduce wastage and try more varierty.
5
Food was very delicious and service was good. Ording was very easy and straight forward using tablet.
5
Surprisingly service was very fast and they didn't miss any order this time despite full house. Food was also less salty. Kudos to improvement
4
The food was not bad, sashimi was good. The selection / variety was ok. Definitely value for money!!
4
First visit to Shin Minori and was pleasantly surprised at the selection. Generous portioning of the sashimi slices which were fresh. Grilled dishes less impressive. Only negative is the noise from the renovations upstairs.
4
The sashimi is fresh and generously sliced. Always visit this restaurant with my hubby. Introducing group of friends over to celebrate birthday on 20th Jan.
3
Quite value for money but some items get loss in process of ordering . Worst of all seated next to a family with 2 very disruptive kids
3
Good food in general. You place your order on a tablet. Some of the food ordered did not come. When I mentioned this to one of the waiters, he told me to simply place another order. I thus had to wait quite a bit. Some food came twice. When I pointed out that one of the dishes did not seem fresh, the waiter (who seemed senior) gave me a blank look and did not bother to apologise or replace it. I would still go back though
5
The sashimi is fresh and the grilled food tasted amazing! I would definitely come back here again :)
3
have ordered some food but most of it did not arrive. have to reorder again and yet same issue. service did not clear the table till the food order came.
3
Come with a very small serving when you place an order. Waiting time is long. Overall, the price is still not valuable.
2
Everything else was fine except for the front desk receiptionist whom answered my call. He was extremely rude.
2
Only the sashimi is good. None of the cooked food is nice. Yakitori is either tasteless or sauce too sweet. Bean sprouts teppanyaki is very oily. Sushi is average.
5
Service Stuff very attentive n profesional
Food served fresh n fast
Atmospher very cosy and suitable for All fucntion..
1
Service was terrible, food was over fried and over salted. It took forever for anything we ordered to arrive, and it was cramp and sounded like a fish market. For $10 more, we could have gone to Marriot for their weekend buffet, We are never, ever returning
3
Booked the restaurant from the stellar reviews found online. Thought the food was alright. The sashimi slices were particularly thick but not great. We order a variety of sashimi but felt too full to continued with much of the other cooked dishes. For the same price, I think there are better Japanese buffet restaurants.
3
Decided to visit this joint as I saw that it was voted as one of the best buffet restaurants by Chope. Also, because the entertainer app has 1-1 buffet lunch, I thought it would be worth a try.The food was just average in my opinion though they have quite a good variety of items on the buffet menu. None of the items were exceptionally good, more like mass produced food type of quality. Service was good, the staff was prompt in serving and clearing. The experience reminds me of Nihon Mura. While the value is there, I doubt I will be returning anytime soon
3
The reservation is good but the incessant telephone call through Viber and telephone call is very irritating. After confirming the reservation, the system keeps calling you despite confirming it a few times. It will keep calling until you answer and even is you answer and confirm it, it still keep calling.
5
I keep coming back here for the sashimi. For a buffet dinner, the quality is good. The other food items are tasty as well and the selection is wide.
5
Went during 1st Jan. food served is fresh and fast. Atmosphere is average. Waiters are polite and prompt in what you requested for.
3
Was there for lunch to celebrate my gf birthday. Menu variety was ok and ordered food comes quite promptly. But my hamachi sashimi cut was way to thick hehe...
4
Sashimi was good , not the thinly sliced types that u get at most buffets . Food was cooked upon ordering so they arrive hot, so expect to wait a little .
But it's worth it. Definitely will visit again.
4
Good and balanced list of food selection. We were led into a VIP room near the main door however the shoe rack for 10 persons and many carton boxes have produced some odour. Hope this can be improved.
5
I used the entertainer app for 1-for-1 and the price is definitely worth it. my second visit to this shop!
3
Pros:Sashimi cuts were clean and texture of fish was good. Sushis were quite appetising like fried california roll and the eel with cheese ones. However, sadly no salmon belly or aburi unlike Ikoi (another jap buffet). Cons:Most fried food like sashimo and gyoza is not nice. Both of these were underdone and gyoza was too oily. Service was slow (I understand that as the place was almost filled) but towards the end, we sat for about an hour chatting and some items we ordered did not even come. Overall, would only recommend this place for sushi and sashimi. Definitely not the best buffet like what people voted.
2
Restaurant was packed and I understand that the staff were busy, but that does not mean that they had to be rude. Lots of food order from the buffet menu wasnt served, asked to refill water but was ignored, even the lady manager was rude from the way she spoke. China staff even had to mumble to show that she was displeased when we requested to change seats before being seated. Horrible experience. Sushi and sashimi was okay but cooked food took up to an hour to be served yet served cold.
3
This was my fourth time there. The food has been inconsistent, ranging from good when the restaurant is quiet to overcooked yakitori when the restaurant is crowded. The last visit I went. The restaurant had a company function. Service was slow, inattentive and the food was mostly dry and over-cooked. Not a good experience since I brought my bf's mother there for a trea
4
Think as we ate throughout the buffet, being seated at the chef's counter, we got to witness the flurry that the chefs experienced as orders furiously and continously flooded the kitchen. We were amazed at how the chefs worked under such intense speed and pressure, and honestly this is a clear indication that as diners, we need to learn to be patient and wait rather than assume that this is a buffet line and expect our food to come continuously and non-stop. The quality of the food was great, as usual, the staff were helpful (most of them) and offered great service. Had a pleasant experience dining here, not my first time and will definitely not be my last either (:
3
Generally, service staff is courteous. However, serving of food is pretty slow. I had the ala-carte buffet lunch. Honestly i am quite surprised that the price for buffet does not include drinks.
5
Considerate service, extensive menu. Though as a la carte buffets go, some ordered items tend to go missing. But this is not a big issue. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone.
3
3rd visit. Standard seems to have dropped. Bones found in sashimi, and cooked items r disappointing.
4
The food is quite good, doesn't feel like it is mass produced though it is a la carte buffet style. Mum loves the clam miso soup.
3
Their default portion per serving is small. Not all orders were served. Food is okay. Value for the food is too much
5
Good food, and very nice setting! Some food arrived a little slow, Generally a good dining experience.
1
Bad service wanted act blur spoke to him but he just kept walking, tablet broke down, sashimi was not all that fresh! And it was so expensive $50 per person
2
Orders through electronic tablet frequently timed out. Food took a long time to come. Taste quality was mostly average. Called for service through tablet twice for refill and no one responded. Had to finally ask serving waiter to do it.
4
We went for Xmas dinner, food quality is gd and food was served to us fast even though it is a busy night. We love our dinner dining experience. For the price we paid for Xmas dinner we were expecting to have more choice for the buffet menu or special items for Xmas but we got the usual buffet menu. Overall is pretty gd..
1
Food is served in very small amount/quantity. Some food were brought to our table not hot, but super cold. Keep serving wrong food and have to wait quite a long while. Waiters/ Waitresses friendliness depends on your luck that day. Most were rude and cannot be bothered with you. Many people said that their standards dropped. Some grilled food were raw inside.Overall, save your money to go to other Jap restaurants
4
A lot of variety of food to choose from the menu for the buffet. Service staff very helpful and friendly.
3
First time trying Shin Minori, there is not much choices for the food. Crew are not friendly at all. Never hit the min standard as a Japanese food restaurant. Bit disappointed!
4
Place is decent. Food is tasty especially the grilled food and the sashimi is very fresh. However, service is a bit slow. and staffs not very attentive.
3
for a buffet oriented restaurant i must say the sahimi items were good and thats only all i can say for this restaurant. short handed on staff as well.
4
Had a very good dinner at Shin Minori on Friday. This restaurant has been around for many years and they dish out decent Japanese food.
4
Food taste great, but orders are missing. Check with waiters, they inform us that missing orders we have to re-order again. Price is acceptable also!
4
I came here to celebrate my birthday and it was a pleasant experience. The food would always come out at different times but the staff were friendly and helpful.
3
Food took long to serve. when we questioned, staff insisted all our orders were out. 2nd time, food was slow too. Took them 3 times to inform us the wine we chosen was sold out n we waited 20 min for it.
2
Some of the food we ordered were not served despite the fact we asked the staff to help us check and confirm that we have indeed placed the order.We have been here several times and we have experienced similar missing orders. But this time is the worst!I think it is time to look for a new place
3
Ordering system improved much from the last time i visited 3 or 4 months back? Sashimi is fresh! But some items can be done better - 1) cha soba was over cooked that it was soggy. N portion size could be smaller. 2) beansprouts was crunchy and nice but super oily :( Other than that, not much complaints. It was even more worthwhile with the entertainer 1for1 deal.
3
Not worth to travel so far to a place which is not convenient. We can have the same quality of food at town. Food choices are limit, and drinks are not included in the package, thus ultimately is more than what you expected.
3
Standard has dropped since the past few times I went, quite disappointing.
The portions were inconsistent, some way too big, some way too small. Very different from initially.
4
Not a good place if you are trying to lose weight or if your Body mass index is too high. Getting really popular and crowded.
5
Very very nice food❤ although it was quite hot as we were sitting near the windows. But the food was amazing!
4
Value for money. Service staff very polite. Manager waived payment for wrong order, no questions asked.
5
Overall dinner at shin minori is very nice, starting from booking of reservation, order of food using tablet till bill payment. Everything's is very smooth! Not disturbance during your dinner too. Atmosphere is like you are in your own world, Only when food is served or need any help from the staff. Value for money, Will visit again.
4
Went there as a group of 24 to celebrate my boy's birthday. Was given a private room but it was very packed to the point of discomfort. Food was great but some of the ala carte buffet orders went mixed up due to "overwhelming" order through the iPad system.
2
A La Carte Buffet Style is good as the food is Hot but order is in a mess, some order is deliver wrong and repeated, some even never come.Chawamushi is very nice!Large group is not recommended as they have only 1 ordering tablet per table
4
Warm and friendly greet from the manager. Like the tablet ordering and serving portion, so we don't have to waste food. The only thing is that some of the food take very long time to come, come after our 4th or 5th round of order (45 min). After all, satisfied and will recommend for it good service and good food
3
This place is quite popular, so I decided to book a day in advance. However, the earliest time slot for the ala cart lunch buffet was 1 pm.Food was ordered thru a tablet which was very easy to use. Service was surprisingly fast despite the crowd. Now the food. The variety and selection was good. Taste wise however is nowhere close. There is really nothing to make one say that wow, I really have to order this the next time I'm here. Nevertheless, it did serve it's function as we were rather hungry at 1 plus pm.Please be warned that last order is at 2. 00. We barely finished the initial order when we were politely told of that. Perhaps it is my fault that I did not notice it on the website when I did the booking. So do book earlier time slots if you like to linger and take your time in eating
4
Sashimi was nice.
Restaurant was packed wish made the ambiance quite lively.
Would go back for the buffet.
5
Fresh sashimi! Sushi items are all great. Grilled items so-so only. Overall still value for money. Will definitely go back again.
4
A good ala cart japanese buffet with sizeable range of food.
We went for Monday dinner so it's pretty quiet. But the orders still went missing and we were unsure if we should wait or reorder.
3
Staff helpful and friendly. Food is on the average side though. Initially had the expectations that us was awesome based on review. Possibly over expectated. Other wise it was decent
2
My wife and I were there to celebrate our anniversary and were looking forward to a wonderful selection of Japanese food and some quality service. Unfortunately, to our dismay, food wasnt great and service was atrocious. They firstly kept getting our orders wrong and till this day we still wonder where our unagi sushi and spider maki disappeared to. They probably eloped and found a nice little home in a hill unbeknown to us. What more, staff didnt seem happy to serve us and we even saw a few of them trying to communicate in mandarin to the Filipino guys beside us, which was puzzling because they clearly could not understand what the service staff were saying. Apart from the sashimi and stir fried beef, everything else tasted like it came from a salt factory, not sure if they were trying to mask the flavours of the food or kill the bacteria in it. The raw squid tasted like they had talcum powder powdered all over it like a baby's rash filled bottom. Definitely not a place for a first date... But maybe your last..
1
Had a really awful experience. Made reservations for 630pm and reached there at 645 pm due to heavy traffic (Standard Chartered Marathon - road closure). Reservations were given away - claimed that our booking was 6 pm instead of 630 pm from their system and they sent SMS confirmation with we did not receive. If we did, we could have changed because it was not what we wanted. Winnie the manager was very adamant - although system is as good as what staff key in (garbage in garbage out) because we booked via phone not internet. No apologies only impoliteness. I would not recommend the place at all neither would my family / and I ever patronise this restaurant. Very poor customer service...
3
Decent selections but not cheap. Costs $80+ after GST. Had to pay for beverage too. Ordering was made easy with tablet but the tablet would restart when you've ordered a certain amount which can be irritating as you would relaunch the app and re order. Quantity was reasonable, small portions for an ala- carte buffet.
4
Great Japanese 'order off the menu' buffet, set in a cosy and relaxed atmosphere. It's eat all you want a la-carte, complete with a reasonably substantial ipad menu. Service is prompt, efficient and cheerful.. The price is wallet friendly, considering it's Japanese, its located in Singapore and its eat as much as you desire. Its not cheap but affordadable for Singapore. Importantly, the food is really good., actually its great. Authentic (I've lived in Japan) and you can eat asquickly or as slowly and relaxed as you wish.Drinks are reasonably priced too (by Singaporean standards).Good enough to return? Absolutely. Going again this weekend. Recommended.Tip: Make a reservation, it gets busy and the restaurant doesnt seat many...
4
Sashimi was fresh and variety is quite good. I particularly enjoyed the pumpkin chawanmushi which is not found in other japanese restaurants. We used Entertainer app so we only paid the price of one for both of us which made the lunch very value for money. The only downside was the tablet for ordering the food. The tablet was not responsive at times and it resulted in us double-ordering as we sent the orders twice, thinking the first time was not captured as the system hanged. As such we had double orders on some dishes which meant we had less stomach for trying other dishes
5
This is a great place for unlimited Japanese food at a reasonable price.The assortment of sashimi offered is pretty good. I love the tuna as it's very fresh.All items comes in pretty small sizes which is great as it gives your stomach a chance to savour as much variety as you want.A definite must try if you're into good quality Japanese buffet
5
Awesome service and even better food! We were promptly served and food always came hot and delicious. Seafood were extremely fresh and staff were polite and helpful. Never been happier! Highly recommend
5
Better service than last visit in jul. Staff were diligent in clearing plates & all food items were served. Some items were still salty but that's the usual
4
Food was good except the table assigned to us was basically quite tiny, even though there is plenty of unoccupied table at 1.30pm.
4
Nice ambience and service was polite. I love the sashimi variety there. The lunch buffet was worth the money if you are a sashimi lover. They have quite an extensive grilled spread too!
5
The food was great and worth it. Love the platter of sashimi. They were very fresh. Aside from having wrong or missing food orders due to lack of staff, my family and I enjoy the restaurant overall.
2
rigid service with ref to promo voucher. Insist that i print out the voucher for the snow crab soup despite they have extra copies. I have also diwnliaded fron phone snd showed to the chinese malaysian kady supervisor! Soup was eventuslly serve but cold!
4
Came here with the 1 for 1 entertainer app and it was definitely well worth the trip! Service was fast and food was pretty all right for the price.
4
The location is somewhat out of the way from MRT but not to difficult to find. Speed of serving is good but there was order that was made first and yet not delivered after second order. Quality wise OK. Overall good value for money especially with a 1 for 1 offer
4
Despite the crowd on a Sunday evening, the experience was good. The food was on time and in relative good qnatity. Outstanding meal and fresh sashimi to top it. The other thing I like is the ordering system...just order via the iPad... orders don't get lost and you get what you ordered - unlike the other Japanese restaurants where some of the order disappears..
4
We were there to celebrate friends' birthday. With a total of 10 people, we were given a nice room. The food was fresh - i love the sashimi. The rest of the food were great except for some grilled/ bbq items which were very dry and hard to chew while some orders were forgotten. The service was great as the staff came in to check on us. The price is reasonable and we will definitely go again
5
Great food and service, never a disappointment. Went with a group of 7, wide range of food from sashimi, sushi, tempura and teppenyaki dishes.
4
Been here with family for birthday celebration. The selection is pretty good and good value for money. Sashimi is fresh.
4
very worth and value for money even though it was quite difficult to locate.
The sashimi are very fresh and i love the shrimp tempura.
However, the buffet does not include drinks.
But you can get a cup of green tea with additional cost.
3
If you are only here for the sashimi, its fresh, thick slice, good range of sashimi. However, other food like the grilled category/ handroll, not very nice. Nothing to rave, but i can say its for sashimi lovers.
3
80% of items are rice/noodles. Sashimi was fresh but always served last. Mentaiko spaghetti was bad. It was obviously pre-prepared & heated up in microwave or something. Grilled/Fried items were a tad too salty.
4
Given the sat lunch crowd, the food is still cooked perfectly everytime. Sashimi cut at the right thickness.
3
For the food, most of them were delicious and well prepared. Each dish comes in a small portion, which is good because you don't have to eat too much and can order other dishes. If you like that dish, you can always order more anyway. The waiters and waitresses were excellent servers. They are professional and friendly, not to mention interactive. They talk to you and understand your needs, rather than those 'follow the books, scripted words' kind of server. However, when the restaurant gets busier, they attended to us slower and the 'call for service' on their ipad was not working (or they are ignoring it). Atmosphere was okay, nicely decorated, however the seat we got was a window seat and it started to get very warm after a while
5
First of all, first of this buffet is not cheap, so it might not be the ideal place if you are tight on budget. That said, the buffet price is < $50 after GST & Service charge, with a HUGE variety of japanese food, from classic sushi, sashimi (Salmon, Ika, Maguro, Taco, EVEN FREE-FLOW HAMACHI HOLY), handrolls, to grilled food, cooked food, udon, etc. The chefs are very generous with servings (sashimi was thick and juicy), so you do not have to constantly reorder. They use ipad to order so it is very convenient. Overall, a great place to indulge and satisfy your Japanese food cravings once in a while
4
Food is good and with a wide selection. Price is affordable too. Crowd was quiet for a Thursday dinner. Service could have been improved, we mentioned to the waitress that we were there for the first time but she didn't explain to us what does the buffet package includes. She only told us to order from the menu with a Samsung tablet. We had to ask a second waiter to know about paying additional for drink
4
9 of us had a gathering at shin minori, we are thankful we got the private room. However we wasn't inform that additionally green tea was chargeable. We had 9 hot tea from start and 3 of them wanted to change to cold tea at the end of the dinner. We were charged 12 tea n in total there's 9 of us.
4
This is my first time to Shin Minori. I was worried that the service would be very slow. To my surprise, the food was served very quickly.
As we are using uob card for 1 for 1 promotion, its super worth it
5
Great place ! Great ambience , food was served fast and waiters were all pretty friendly and efficient :) definitely 5/5 would dine there again. But pretty sad restaurant is pretty small
2
My order list was misplaced, have to wait for 45 min to realise my order form is lost. Feel very disappointed for the service. I feel the service is poor not worth to pay the service charge.
4
Went with colleagues for dinner. Salmon spread was good. sushi is also nice.nice place to have friends gathering for chitchat.
2
Orders are placed via a tablet and we ended up waiting for 15min to be served. Only the sashimi was served quickly, everything else took really long to prepare and we spent more time waiting for our food than eating. The kitchen also forgot many of our orders. Sashimi was ice-cold in the middle and the grilled dishes were too salty. Would not come back again.
2
I have dined in Shin Mori a year before, which I have had great experience as the service then was good, so was the quality of food.Encouraged by the good experience before, I went back with 2 other friends on last Friday but the experience was a let down.We were not served any drinks for nearly 1/2 an hour. When we waved to the waiters around, one of them took order for green tea but forgot to serve until we reminded him 10 minutes later. The green tea was not even hot upon serving.The shasimi we ordered was not fresh and the hand rolls were not freshly made.This time my overall experience is poor
3
The sashimi and the sushi were nice and fresh. Cuts of sashimi is great unlike some restaurants which are just thin slices. However, the service is terrible. The tablet menu crashes and took a while to recover. The staff were not really around to be called. Ordered food and the items came out in wrong quantity and no one bother letting us know what is what. Had to remind the order is not served. Had to repeat three times and I have to personally walk to the counter to remind. That was after about 30 min of waiting. Impression left on my guest was less to be desired.
3
Was there for a 1 for 1 promotion with UOB credit card. Ambience was cozy with dim lightings and privacy from other diners assured with separators place between the tables. Overall portion between 2 pax is adequate without being overwhelming and all their maki rolls were really tasty. I would recommend the Pumpkin chawanmushi as well. However as they could be understaffed at the moment, getting their attention is quite challenging.
4
My second visit to the restaurant was a little more hectic than my first. The iPad ordering service was down but the staff were quick to issue out order sheets. However, this resulted in slowing of service, duplicate orders, and some missing orders. However, the staff who was in charge, Winnie, was always friendly, patient and helpful. She even remained calm after another patron got verbally abusive because of the slow service. Food was good â€” my fave are the sashimi, crab cream soup, potato salad, etc. My child liked the chawanmushi a lot, and my parents the tempura.Overall, will visit again
3
Came here with more than 30 colleagues from different part of Asia when they were here for a training. Service was prompt and cheerful even when the restaurant was full. There was wide range of menu choices. It's value of money so you get what you pay for. Overall, it was a lively atmosphere and everyone enjoyed themselves
4
Service was prompt and the sashimi was fresh and thick. The service staff were rather attentive and we had no problems getting their attention. The Takoyaki was crispy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside. Wished I had stomach for more.
4
Friendly staff, fresh sashimi...Reasonable prices too...Booking required on weekend. Bean Sprouts and teppanyaki meat are tasty.
5
A trusted place for good quality sashimi at awesome value with UOB 1 for 1 promotion in October 2016. It would be better if you have the promotion with Citibank!
4
Sashimi is fresh and nice, other food such as teppanyaki of cabbage, bean sprouts, chicken are tasty as well. Staff were attentive to our needs and they are friendly.
4
Came here for the buffet lunch, sashimi as per mention are quite good. Portions they serve are bite size, good for couples dining.
2
We had the 1 for 1 buffet under UOB promo.. varieties is good but food was served very very slowly. Ordered the bean sprout and it took 40mins to arrive even though there are only few ppl at that time. Everything need to order via the iPad even for a cup of water and it cost $0.80.
5
The shashimi served is very fresh. Service staff are quick and efficient. You do not have to wait too long for food to be served. Has quite an array of dishes on the menu. The Mango shebert and green tea cheesecake was fantastic. We enjoyed our meal very much and will certainly make a come bac
3
Food was not as good as I remembered from a few years ago. But quality of the sashimi was still good and fresh. Teppanyaki was good in terms of taste but they could be more generous with the quantity per serving. Maki and other sushi were passable to say the least. Nothing memorable. Service was also a little slow - it took awhile for our food to be served and the time lag between dishes was quite long.
3
There ain't many Japanese buffet in Singapore and Minori spread considered good. However, as many have commented, indeed their service isn't prompt for it took us to signal a few times before we got attended to. Just 1 incident to highlight - they need to double check to ensure that the ipad is securely fasten. Mine dropped midway through my meal and caused a mess. But they were fast in this aspect of cleaning. It would have improved our dining experience if they would to relocate us to a clean table instead
3
Sashimi was fresh. Other food items - not bad, but not fantastic either.Tablet for ordering was lagged, & then went crushed - resulting in some items ordered but not captured.Had to re-order manually with the service staff.Overall ambience not too bad. Can go? Probably yes - for the experience
4
Foods is good n fresh for the price we paying.
As for servicing, there room to improve, staff not so friendly.
4
Value for money using entertainer app. Staff were attentive but not flexible. Booking for restaurant was easy. Food is not too bad for buffet
4
Value for money especially with the entertainer apps. Recommended for social and family gatherings. Need to book in advance as it is always fully booked!
5
The food serve were fresh and my family enjoy it. The service is fast and efficient. The atmosphere is good for family and friends. Will definitely visit again
5
Went there for quite a few times and the sashimi are all very fresh. The must tries are their BBQ though.
4
Yummy food, efficient service & cool ambience. Food was served without waiting too Long. Staff was friendly at check-out.
5
Our friend suggested and took us to this restaurant.
We are surprised to find good quality Japanese buffet at reasonable price.
Will be back soon.
5
Went for the UOB one for one lunch deal and spent under $50 for a la carte buffet. Atmosphere was great for catch up. Service was very efficient and friendly. Food was authentic and very fresh! Will be back very soon!
4
UOB card one-for-one deal. Service staff were prompt and friendly. ordered from tablet at table, some orders did not go through and had to key-in all over again. sat at tables near sushi bar and some areas were used as storage with boxes piled up, rather eyesore. food wise, buffet selection was quite wide with sashimi, sushi, teppanyaki, tempura, grilled fish, cooked food like rice, noodles, soup, salad and deep fried stuff. what i did not like was the sashimi wasn't slice uniformly, some were thicker. and there were only 3 items for selection under teppanyaki. ordered the beansprouts, cant recall what was the other 2 items
4
Food - The sashimi was very good. However, dishes with sauce are a bit too salty for our taste.Value - All in about $90 for two without drinks. Would consider it value for money given the quality of food and ambience.Service - We struggled with the ordering system for a while. Requested for a change of table after several attempts by the staffs to fix the tablet.Atmosphere - Typical japanese restaurant. Not too noise for a good chat
3
Sashimi is of good quality ... Other food that we tasted not as expected ... So just rate overall as average. But the 1 for 1 credit card promo makes it much more worthy of the visit
4
Food was great especially the sashimi. Service was very fast though the restaurant was full. Will come back again!
5
made booking thru chope for 4 people. they were very accommodating when 5 of us turned up.
service was prompt. food arrived very fast too (within 10min of ordering)
quality of food (sushi, sashimi) was acceptable too.
will definitely go back again.
4
Sashimi served were very fresh and portion of servings maintained despite several repeated orders. Will definitely visit again
5
The service was nothing short of great! Albeit the seating arrangements was not what I expected and was disappointed, (I had 14 pax but they had to split us), thr expectations of service and food was beyond.
5
Food came fast after we ordered. Sashimi was fresh and good. Could have more premium selections. Quiet place, good for chit chats
3
I had a reservation 3 weeks ago before I went there with my friends. I wanted to have the private room so I put down my remarks via Chope reservation system. When I was there, I told the counter staff I had a private room reservation, but they said rudely "minimum charge for private room usage must be 450++". It looks like they were worrying I got no money to pay for it. They continue to say "So you still want the normal dining table reservation or not?" I have to bear with it , not for anything else but for my friends. My point is it doesn't matter if I can't get the private room / i have to pay for the private room, It is matter that the counter staff doesn't have the basic manner towards guests.IF the owner of the restaurant happened to see this, please give some guidance to your staff on such matters. [UNLESS THE OWNER FEEL THAT THE STAFF WERE CORRECT TO TELL ME OFF.] I remembered that the counter staffs were 1 guy and 1 lady, both uniforms in black. Seems like they are restaurant manager / supervisor. Date of my visit - 30 Sep 2016
3
Went for buffet lunch and the food was served very slowly for all the tables.It was only later that they discovered that orders did not went to the kitchen. It was resolved later on.It wasn't a fantastic experience taking to account what was being reviewed. Variety of food for buffet is not wide in my opinion
5
This is my first visit to the restaurant. They offer a 1 for 1 Ala Carte buffet dining until 31 October 2016 with the UOB card. Excellent range of food items for selection. Food quality and service is good. Ordered a bottle of sake to go with the meal too. Overall enjoyable experience. Will visit again!
4
This is another outlet of the now closed Shinkei, which was previously at Toa Payoh. The menu is generally the same, with a few slight additions to the barbecued section. Service staff were very meticulous and efficient, always clearing the tables the moment they see empty plates. The manager, Winnie, is very polite, and she is very attentive to details. Remembering the preferences of the customers, she will show initiative in helping them attain their orders quickly. Well Done Shin Minori, all you need now is to have more promotions for loyal customers like me! :

Excellent spread of Japanese dishes. Good quality and value for money. Easy ordering process through ipad.
3
It would be great if desserts we're incorporated into the buffet.
Food is average for a buffet. My friend ordered the fried soft shell crab, small crabs were served at the table.
4
Nice buffet and the food is served fast. A lot of variety of foods to choose. Portion is small so that you can try most of the foods.
4
Overall happy with their food and services but would be good if they can cut the sashimi a bit thinner as is too thick slice. Like the food varieties it offers, would love to come back again!
4
The test of any Japanese restaurant is the freshness of the sashimi. Sin Minori makes the mark, with fresh, thickly slice sashimi. The hand roll is passable, the maki forgettable. Grilled items are ok. With the one-for-one promotion, it is one sure good value meal.
5
I must say, food standard has definitely gotten better especially with their sashimi! Food was on point in terms of taste & freshness. Food was served fast too. The customer service of their stuff was excellent and definitely commendable. Overall a very good dining experience at Shin Minori. Thank you guys
3
Fried items were excellent: crispy, flavorful, juicy, and without a hint oily taste. However, the grilled items were quite disappointing: they were too dry and rather tasteless. Sashimi and maki were rather average. Nevertheless, the service staff was fast, efficient and very courteous. It was surprisingly packed during a weeknight especially since it is not near to an MRT station.
5
Booked last minute because we were feeling sashimi. We were of two minds after reading the reviews on how bad the service is, but decided to push ahead having not seen anything other than positive comments about the quality of the food. Glad we did. This place is great. We had no issues with the service and the sashimi is fantastic.
4
It was a pretty good dining experience. The service was fine considering that it was quite crowded. Ordering the food was very easy. The food was good and varied. Atmosphere was cosy. Overall, my family enjoyed the dinner and would recommend this place to others who like Japanese food.
3
the tablet thst was attached at table was malfunctioned. it stopped working for more than 5 times and when that happened, all orders entered that hasn't been sent to kitchen will be wiped out. wasted a lot of our time. most food were also very salty. and drinks were chargeable not included as part of buffet
5
Sashimi is fresh, wide varieties of food, food are served fast. Overall a pleasant experience. Will visit again definitely!
3
A few items ordered was not served even when it was ordered twice, restaurant needs to step up on their tablet ordering system, of diners can get their order served, there would not be duplicate orders and the kitchen would not be jammed.
3
Food was so-so. Can't pin point which dish I like best in the buffet.
Service was prompt. One of the cashiers was very obliging to split the bill for 8 of us.
5
Worth the money with the range of items on the buffet menu. Sashmi was fresh and succulent.
Service was prompt and good.
4
Fresh sashimi, freshly fried tasting karrage, grilled perfect yakitori.
Lovely meal. great price with UOB 1-1.
5
made a booking via chope. went there during their promotion. food arrived fast after ordering. the selection was wide. the sashimi was fresh.
3
Had been to this restaurant many times but it was such a disappointing experience on 9/9/16.The love apple dessert ordered was totally different from the picture on the menu and it taste horrible. My friends also ordered the Green Tea Cheese Cake and it also tasted horrible. Would not recommend my friends there again.
5
Dear Shin MinoriIt was a great and satisfied dinner for our family. We have no hesitation to recommend our family and friends to this restaurant. I was truly and sincerely to give complimentary to Shin Minori Jap restaurant and keep it up with all your excellent dishes.Thumb up..
1
Ordered a dish and reminded them 5 times, kept telling me it is coming and after 1.5 hours still did not serve. Frustrated and called for the bill. Most dishes are tiny in size relative to the market standard. As it was ala-carte buffet, they seemed to be deliberate in serving slowly and conveniently did not serve some dishes thinking that people will forget what they ordered
4
went to try out using the entertainer 1-for-1. Location is a little inconvenient for me as I had to walk from Clarke Quay station under the sun, but luckily it was worthwhile. Sashimi was fresh and thickly sliced :)Selection of sushi and yakitori was good.
3
Overall, the food and service are up to our expectations. The only bad experience is finding our way to the building's carpark.
3
Salmon & Swordfish sashimi was fresh. The tuna was pale & dry. BBQ foods a tad too salty. Overall, acceptable value for the spread. Staff was attentive and pleasant.
5
Automated booking system make booking a breeze. We had buffet lunch. The price is reasonable and the food is very good with plenty of choices. Will definitely come again
5
Wide variety of sushi and other Japanese food to suit everyone's tastes. Amazing quality. We will be back.
4
Food was good, service was prompt. Will be back again soon. Parking was also easy and affordable in the building.
4
Nice place to have your fill of japanese food. Brought over a visiting friend there and he enjoyed the food.
4
Salmon Sashimi very fresh. Loved the edamame and chawanmushi as well. The white colored sashimi wasn't so fresh we went on 14 August 2016
5
Food was served promptly and hot and it is very worth it. Would definitely return again in the future :)
5
This is the 6th time I am going to this place, I love the food and sake. I had a terrible experience this time, there these two Jokers in black dress (a Woman and a Young chap) standing in the Reception, bloody Rude behavior. Gee they never thought they are working Service Industry. Simply to say terrible
4
For some orders, the portion is small, some portion is relatively huge, so probably good to check with the waitress. The waitress from china however doesn's seem professional. irregardless, the good quality is quite good for the price. My second visit this round. will definately visit again
3
The sashimi was cut too thick and the tuna sashimi was cut wrongly, with too much veins making it hard to bite.
5
Good variety of sashimi, cuts are thick and fresh. Nice range of tempura and other grilled dishes as well!
4
The food was of good quality. Reservations were made via Chope and it was easy to use & confirmation was prompt. Staff were very proactive & attentive to customers needs. Very pleasant dining experience 👍👍👍😄🍴
4
Overall food quality is there but seems a lot decreased from buffet menu. Need to improve on the listing and variety
5
Fortunate to found out about chope and manage to book this restaurant, we have a great evening in a private room arrangement for 8 of us.
2
food did not deliver when order via tablets. have to wait for some time and food delay. not really recommended.
5
We love the sushi, is fresh and generous potion. My mum 86, who is not in good appitite lately enjoy the meal very much. She specially love the fried cabbage is sweet and crunchy and grill eggplant too...yummy.
2
Sashimi quality average. Ordered tako sashimi but was told they only give tentacles and head only, I will need to order tako sushi if i wanted the sliced ones. Grilled dishes are generally alright. Overall an average Japanese buffet restaurant.
4
We visited on a public holiday for buffet lunch. The restaurant was full-house. It might be best to place reservations in advance. The food was fresh and delectable. We especially enjoyed the sashimi, yakitori selection and various maki creations. It is best to place orders for most of the items you want at one go. Subsequent orders take awhile to arrive or might be left out, possibly due to shortage of manpower. Other than this little inconvenience, we were pleased with the quality and variety of food. I will certainly return again with friends/family for fuzz free Japanese fare. The bill for our lunch buffet (4 persons) added up to approximately $185 (including drinks).
4
Good food, fresh seafood from their buffet menu. Was impressed at how fast the food came out. We were 4 adults and did the Buffet Dinner menu. -- worth the value for sure and excellent service. Would go back again for sure. The hand rolls and sashimi were excellent and we ate to our hearts content.
4
This is my 2nd time back to this wonderful restaurant, the quality of the sashimi is fresh and not cut thin like other places, the other cooked dishes are well done too! Always my favourite for Japanese buffet!!
4
The quality of the food is great. Very fresh Sashimi n good variety too. Last been there was a couple of years ago. Friendly Service staff too.
3
Nothing fancy to scream about. Sashmi was okay, but the other food are so so. order grill it is almost charred.
5
The sashimi is fresh and thick, food is great! However some of the food took quite long to come. Overall, excellent experience!
3
Great atmosphere but average food.
Had the buffet, unfortunately i feel that the food range is not wide enough.
5
I enjoyed the fresh sashimi and grilled items very much. Very good spread for the price, around $40 pax. Most of the items are up to normal Japanese restaurant standard.
1
For the amount of money that I'm paying, I would have expected better quality than sakae sushi. Sake sashimi was not fresh enough, tako sashimi was served with head and mini tentacles (not with the usual big slices, which is a first for me). Grilled food were moderate but too salty. Garlic fried rice was fragrant but too oily. Salad was served with too much sesame dressing, the lettuce was dripping with dressing. The restaurant should get their portions right. The best dish here was the plain lettuce. I would not come here ever again.
2
High on choice but low on quality for the lunch buffet. The sushi is probably the same quality of those served at Sakae Sushi. Definitely not worth the $34 price tag per head for the buffet. The chuka hotate has to be one of the worst I've ever had. Do note that water is charged at $0.50 at this restaurant. The buffet does not include tea or any dessert. Quite disappointing.
4
Sashimi was great! basically the menu was quite limited, pricing wise, 2 pax for close to 100 bucks.The service staff was alright, few of them spoke loudly in canto.There was also a bbq station, and of course there were burnt smell from time to time.Hope they can improve on the menu, some of their special dishes are ala cart, I mean, i'm paying so much, they can at least have one complimentary dish per person right
5
One of the best japanese grilled buffet for <$50. The sashimi is really fresh though the location is a bit of a pain to get to from the MRT stations. Could be noisy at times, especially during dinner. But do keep in mind that buffet does not include drinks and had to be ordered separately for a la cart price
4
Wide selections of dishes and good value for money. Staff were attentive. The only thing which needs improvement is the maki menu and composition.
4
Nice foods n services. Will sure visit again. Hope That in future there will be more branch other than UE Sq. And hope to have 1 for 1 promotion.
4
Prepare to get a food coma once you're done, don't think I'll be able to see sashimi the same way ever again.
4
Good quality Japanese food at decent price. Great for those who loves quality Japanese food without much fuss. While the selection can definitely be improve on, there is enough variety to keep us going.
3
The food is still up to standard but The service is not there thing we order is not here despite we requested many times
4
The choices are quite a lot, and they suit our palate just fine, especially the pumpkin chawanmushi. The place is a little bit dim, but the service is swift & excellent.
2
When I first entered the restaurant the female assistant manager didn't ask for my reservation but asked the guy behind me instead. When I flag out she was quite rude and said "so what is your phone number ?" That was bad attitude like I owe her. Food was ok but not great. Sashimi and sushi were quick but the rest like Gyoza and yakitori were really slow. I strongly recommend The Japanese buffet restaurant at Hotel Royal - much better quality.
1
Only the food photos on website looks good, but it is not. One of the worst Japanese ala carte buffet restaurant we (4 adults) have experienced. Website said "authentic" Japanese food, which I have my doubts! Our first and last visit. The price does not include the basic drinks i.e. water and/or green tea. Service is bad too. Chefs and waitresses speaks only Chinese, not that I have problem with Chinese, but this is just to highlight to visitors who are non Chinese speaking
5
My friends and I had a private room to ourselves as there were 11 of us. The restaurant has an extensive range of food for the buffet menu, and our food arrived within 10 minutes after we place our order. Food was fresh and generous cut for sashimi, definitely worth our money
4
Food was served very slow despite the place was not fully packed. My friends and I order grilled food and it took close to an 1 hour for the food to reach us. Some orders was not served as well, yet the server there told us it was already served. Need more improvement on customer service
4
Food is tasty, just they didnt included dessert in their buffet menu. And not so satisfied with the octopus sashimi.
4
Title says it all. They had maintained the standard of the food over the years since my first visit like half a decade ago.
2
Over rating!
There are plenty choice of buffet to try if were to pay these range pricing.
The sashimi cut is thick enough.... However the food is not fresh and worth what we paid.
And the worst is I diarrhea after that meal...
2
We paid $37++ for 2 (with a one for one promo) for a buffet lunch which was the most I would be willing to pay for the quality of the food here, especially when Robertson Quay is dotted with good quality Japanese restaurants all over. Sashimi - edible but not fresh. Beef and udon - tasted terrible, left them on the table. Chawanmushi was not bad. Yakitori sticks were really poor quality especially the chicken parts (gizzard, heart)... Probably stored frozen for a long time before they were served. My previous visit wasn't as bad as this one as I recall the sashimi used to be a lot fresher. I wouldn't go back to this restaurant..
5
If you are a lover of thick fresh juicy sashimi, Shin Minori is definitely your kindda place ! Was using the entertainer app on an 1 for 1 promo thus it was a great deal .unlikely to go if there is no 1 for 1 though ..If I'm paying the full price , I would rather go hokkaido sushi restaurant which is also currently priced at $38 for ala carte buffet lunch
4
Wide range menu to choose from, Sashimi, sushi, handrolls, tempura, soups, pan fried, grilled items etc The sashimi platter had lovely slices of salmon belly, which I enjoyed. The garlic fried rice and cod roe spaghetti was superb! We presented the promo voucher and the restaurant gave us a big serving of Alaska snow crab nabe. It was delicious and fresh! Looking forward to going back to celebrate my birthday in August!
3
The only reason Shin Minori stands out is because of the bang for the buck! Their a la cartÃ© buffet is what makes it so special, at only 30-40 Singapore dollars per person. It's absolutely incredible for those who'd just love to stuff themselves up after weeks of sushi cravings! Service wasn't bad for a busy place, food definitely wasn't the best but it's just past satisfying! For a low budget sushi craze, this is exactly what you're looking for
3
The sashimi such as tuna, salmon, sword fish, octopus are thick and fresh. Generally acceptable. But the rest of the food are just mediocre and nothing remarkable to talk about. Salads have too much dressing hence very saltish. Fried vegetables - cabbage too oily. Complimentary salmon fish are served too early even before all guests arrive. The buffet doesn't include drinks - even Japanese tea and water are chargeable. Even though tea can be continuously replenished, but need reminders to fill the teapots
3
This is my second visit to Shin Minori so I've decided to pen down (type down?) my review. Generally the standard of japanese dishes are quite alright. I have to mention some of my favourite/ must-order. Their seafood salad, pumpkin chawanmushi, yakitori electively, sushi selectively as well and garlic fried rice are quite good. What I am unhappy about is their customer service and/or servers attitude. The servers especially a lady in particular typically throw the dish plates onto our table and without saying excuse me while I was tucking in my food over my plates. It happened everytime she serves. This is an ala-carte buffet so you do expect that alot. There was practically no smile on their faces and that include their supervisor/captain if you would call that. The ambience was quite alright but table arrangement was cramp. Price for a weekend lunch buffet is about $40+ inclusive of taxes. Well, I was lucky to be using some promotion so I paid much lesser than that. To conclude, I would say if you are nearby River Valley and craved for some japanese buffet food... Consider trying them, if not I personally would not visit again for the price and service you will be paying for.
4
Staff are very friendly & helpful. Service is pretty fast despite of the crowd. All my friends thank me for bringing them to such a wonderful restaurant that serve fabulous Japanese cuisine and fresh sashimi!! They even have the intention to bring their family next visit! I'll definitely recommend more friends there! I'll be back..
2
Tablet menu don't work as we ordered a curry rice and didn't come despite telling the waiters a few times
2
Food is of average quality. Rice used in sushi not real Japanese rice and of wrong proportions. Orders were frequently late or did not get served at all.
5
The food there is really fantastic. Recommend to reserve a seat in advance because it filled up quickly.
5
The sashimi was very fresh and overall the selection of food was excellent. The quality of food was excellent.
4
I have been to Shinminori quite a number of times. I find that the potato I ordered yesterday didn't taste as good as before. But the other food were all decent and nice.
5
Good food & good service. Very firm & fresh salmon. Worthy of wait. Better to reserve using Chope.com app
4
Awesome place to dine Japanese buffet. Free flow of Sashimi is fresh, ambiance is pretty good, food served is mostly fast. It is a bit pricey, and there wasn't wagyu beef.
2
Bad quality of food.
Cramped environment. Not advisable for family with more than 1 child.
Badly lit.
Service was mediocre.
Not advisable for big
2
We order 4 chawanmushi during our dinner. Eating half way my wife notice that there are some weird smell in it , so i get it from her and have a small taste on it .... to my surprise there are some detergent smell in it ,,,, immediately we ask the supervisor over for some explanation, to our surprise she just told us there are no smell in it and just take it back into the kitchen and just bring us another cup of it to us and ask us to try .... and tell us this is from the same tub. Frankly speaking we didnt bother to try that anymore and just keep quiet from there . But we are very sure we will never go back there any more and will tell our friends about this.
2
Well we booked a table for 2 pax through Chope but they did not receive the booking. When we got there, the restaurant was pretty empty and when we saw the table the waiter was bringing us, which was next to a wall and a table top acting as a partition from the next table; the neighbouring table was just right next to us.We asked if we can have another table near the windows to have a bit more privacy. The waiter said they were reserved. Throughout the whole night, nobody came for those tables. I just thought that since its a quiet Wednesday, the waiter should have given us a better table instead of lying to us that those table were reserved
4
Will definitely go back again. Ordering are all through TAB which makes it very easy. But it will be good if there's exact photo of each item.
4
The dining experience was great. Food was fantastic! The service was quite fast before it reaches 8 p.m. though it took close to an hour for me to get my refill of ice water :(
2
The tablet system in the restaurant is very poor. A few times the order we sent to the kitchen did not get registered. We had to keep ordering and spent a lot of time waiting. A waste of time. Will not go there again! Very disappointe
2
Went there for the first time and came out with disappointment. Was told that their online food order system is down. Given a piece of paper to write down our orders but the number of pens that are provided are limited. Eventually the customers next to our table lent us their pen. Waited for half an hour for the 1st dish to be served. The food are served very slowly. Almost waited for another half an hour for the 2nd dish to be served. The orders that we have made didn't turn up eventually and the dishes that we didn't ordered was served. Waitresses and waiters were dashing here and there panicky. Service can be better if the waiters and waitresses can be more polite when taking orders and acknowledge the customers' requests. Eg: I wanted to refill the hot green tea, the waitress came, listened to me and walked away without saying anything or nodding the head. Waitresses did bump into when they walked pass and they didn't apologized. When they are asked about the dish they are serving, the answers i got all the time is "I don't know" or "I have no idea". Food is so so. I'm pretty sure I can pay the same amount of money and get a better food and service in other japanese buffet restaurant
1
The place was extremely noisy and there were drunkards shouting loudly but no service staff bothered to address that. Had to place my orders FOUR times but the food still did not arrive. Service was bad and we were not allowed to order additional Ala Carte food even though we are paying for that. Spent $165 for 2 servings of sashimi, 2 bowls of plain udon, 3 sets of sushi, 2 servings of vegetables and 4 chicken wings! The rest of the food never arrived. A most horrible dining experience ever
3
second time visit the outlet cos of the 1 dine 1 free promo...the slots are in 90mins blocks fixed so we cant choose our time to dine... my only issue is with the tako sashimi...its not the same as wats advertised...they served basically small whole tako...not those big n sliced up type...there are better restaurants to dine in this price range...n the place is quite cold for me..
1
Made a booking at 8pm and came earlier. Waiter mentioned that restaurant is fully booked and insisted to give us the counter seat. There were several empty tables around until 8pm. No table seats were given to us at 8pm, worse still the bbq counter caught fire, there were alot of smoke, no contingency plan to move us to other table, only after a good'o 15mins they decided to move us to an empty table.Over at the new table, electronic food transfer was not done properly and some of our food is missing. Period
4
Singapore has some amazing sushi places but they can be at amazing prices...Very expensive! This place has a nice atmosphere and good quality sushi. It won't be the best you ever had but certainly stands on its own. It is "buffet" style so you pay one price and order all you can eat. You order from tablets at the table. Super easy and efficient. I would recommend a reservation only because they put you near the kitchen on purpose without one...and we were the only ones in the restaurant!Good value and quality for the price.
5
Food was really good and the sashimi was fresh! My three kids (six to nine) had a good time helping themselves to the sashimi and the yakitori. My wife and I had a good spread of the food available and also plates and plates of sashimi! Service was good as well and its definitely one of the best dining experience we ever had! Must return again! :)
4
Food was fresh and arrives promptly. As it is a buffet, we are glad that they ensure the portions aren't too big so that we could taste and try more items. Ambience was fine as well - quite cozy and not too crowded on a Wed night. Service staff was helpful too.
4
Went there using the 1 for 1 lunch redemption coupon. We were only given an hour to order our food. Despite this, the service was still fast n prompt. Sashimi were fresh!
3
Visited on 11thMay2015 with my mother for lunch buffet,where I got an 1 for 1 as I using The Entertainer App. Reached 12pm.As my 1st time here so not sure,which I could ordered. Luckily, there was this lady,she guided me all the way and answered my many questions.Like its garlic fried rice,fried chicken chunks,potato salad,etc...Every items is in small portion,for example 1pc per serving. So when we ordered must take note of the serving size. And find the serving timing is slow,might be restaurant 95% full during lunch time.Overall, beside finding that they should speed up their serving time of each dishes as not only my table but others tables also waited quite long time. Another is their serving portion is too small but menu photo shown is like 2 or 4 per item. But can add on items without extra charge as is buffet. Will still visit as this 1 for 1 deal is great.Would like to compliment the lady wearing black blouse,she always stand at reception,she is patient to all my wonders. Spend $47.08 for 2 as I ordered hot green tea × 2=$3(no drink included in the buffet).The lunch buffet is $37 per pax before tax
4
This is not our first visit to this resturant. Over the years they have been able to maintain the food quality. For a buffet, the food quality is good and decently priced. Sashimi is fresh and the food selection is quite varied. One of my "must have" is their garlic/pepper pork skewer. For groups they usually provide a Salmon fish head as complementary dish. A small nick pick, is that it is time to update their tablet ordering system. Which is a little klunky, slow and shuts down in mid order. Service is decent but not very attentive, but all in all a good family experience.
3
First time there and according to Yahoo information it is top 20 Japanese restaurant. I doubt it as the foods provided is just average. Don't have the WOW factor. It is located in UE Square and the place is quiet on weekend.The restaurant is full house. The food is order via tablet with picture indicating your selection. The serving is a bit slow as it depend the numbers of customer ordering it. The chef will prepare those with many orders. Kimchi i also being served in this Japanese restaurant.I don't think I will recommend people to patronize the outlet
4
We had lunch ala-carte buffet here. Many varieties to choose from and we love their sashimi most. Very fresh Salmon, tuna, yellow tail, red snapper, etc.. others like takoyaki, grilled saba fish, salad, yakitori, were good as well. Food served to us fast & efficient. Can order in small portions which is good and you dont waste food. Staffs were friendly and helpful.
4
Went here the second time last night. It did not dissappoint. Sashimi as always was fresh and the portions were just like ala carte portions. Their robotayakis was impressive. Makis were just so so. Service was superb. They should check the tablets, they dont seem to work at the right moment. Over all i would recommend this place.
1
We arrived at 09:15 and choose the buffet option, at 21:30 the kitchen closed but the waiter didn´t say anything about that, they only came with the bill and said "pay and go we are closing", we expected to get some refund some part but not they only say I´m sorry. So we had to go to other place a re-dinner because we were hungry. Besides the quality of the food is soo poor and the service is stressfull, they are not japanese they are chinese
2
Asked for physical menu but never get it throughout my dinner (approx. 1.5hr). Not much variety to choose and food served extremely slow that we forgot what we've ordered. Taste wise, so-so. Some are too salty, some are too blend. Horrible. Would not recommend this place to others
3
Food was good; sashimi fresh and generous. Grilled items done well and crispy. However the handrolls were not well done. Seaweed was soggy. However do note that the buffet has 2 sessions. 1130-1pm and 1-230pm. They should make this known earlier. Also, the UOB 1 for 1 promo is only for 1 pax per table. This should also be made known earlier
1
First impressions were bad when the Manageress took us to a cramped 2 seater table with a large partition blocking our view of the rest of the restaurant although it was early and the place was still empty. Ordered the buffet for 2 and fairly quickly received but can tell this food was pre-made in the kitchen. Edamame cold, chawanmushi cold, kimchi fried rice hot but it was taken out of oven coz bowl was baking hot. The sushi is the only saving grace of this place as sashimi and maki rolls are good standard. After that it was downhill once their EPOS ordering system broke down. No more food came out of the kitchen for over 45 minutes wait and table after table complaints. Manageress panicking and avoiding customers with no Plan B if something like this happens. This place failed tonight purely because of an over reliance on an ordering system and lack of contingency plan as well as weak management. One of the waiters can just laugh out loudly when it broke down and the Manageress in verbal panic mode. Seriously, you guys should not be in this business. We walked out after they offered that we did not have to pay for the bill
4
With the promotional 1 for 1, it makes the buffet really value for money. The sashimi were good in general, most dishes were pleasant, nothing much to comment on negatively.
4
Restaurant staff was friendly and attentive. Food also arrived within minutes after placing order. However, the tablet used for placing orders was having some problems and we had to wait quite a while before we could order. Other than this overall was a good experience
5
Was given a private room which was unexpected but good surprise n service was excellent :) staff gave a reminder call n though we clocked in 100 items of ala carte orders, food arrived timely n in good portions
4
Sometimes, the kitchen missed our orders but its good if it 1 for 1! Have more promotions, please. Tks
2
Very disappointed the moment we were sat on a miserable small table at 1 corner though we arrive early n the restaurant was still empty. We had buffet n every order took at least 20min to come which is quite ridiculous. Next problem the samsung pad ordering system was down and no one came to assist us til we manage to catch hold of 1 waitress to help us do manual ordering. I think the manager is doing a great job to lead the team instead trying to avoid customers to avoid problem?? I would definitely not reccomend any of my friends here, seriously is the worst Japanese restaurants I have been so far.
4
Shin Minori Restaurant what could I say, my first encounter not impressed with this establishment and I could honestly say that I had much better Japanese food elsewhere. Ordering thru a Samsung tablet which is neither friendly nor instinctive placed the restaurant on the cheap eat scale .Staff seemed pleasant and friendly and attentive. Frankly, the food lacked variety, and the quality of food was average with a run-of-the-mill taste. Certainly not worth the price charged. Very dissatisfied, I would not rush for a second return
5
Pleasant trip. Good quality food, excellent service. Staff are attentive, but would be good if they are clearer with the ordering tablet. No one brief us to submit the order, end up we waited in vain for 20 minutes as we thought our orders were already processed. Else, everything was good
4
This restaurant's ala carte buffet has an excellent selection of dishes at a rather reasonable price tag. The only problem is the standards that vary on different days of the week and sometimes even on the same evening.Most of the time, the sashimi is sweet and fresh - there was only one occasion where I thought the fish could have been fresher. The temaki selection is wonderful but wildly inconsistent - the same dish ordered a second time might not be as good as the first. If it's good, the seaweed is crunchy. The kabocha chawanmushi (pumpkin egg custard) is usually excellent with the right consistency, but if you're unlucky you will get a watery version. The Gyuniku Shogayaki is very tasty as is the agedashi tofu. If you can afford the cholesterol, try the Uzura Shioyaki (grilled quail eggs with salt). The tori teppan and Asari Shiru are also must -trys. The tempura is nothing to shout about, unfortunately. Despite the unpredictable standard, I'd still recommend this place as the dishes hit the spot most of the time. And the price is inexpensive, considering the variety

Average japanese food. At the prices on their menu you would expect much better service. Instead, like a cheap diner, the customer has to order through a tablet. The tablet is not user friendly nor intuitive. My sister had an entertainment 2 for 1 sashimi voucher, which made the price affordable (but we still paid close to $80 in total for the two of us). We did have leftover food, but the restaurant refused to let us take this home unless we paid an extra $15 charge!!!

Came here for lunch this week to try the lunch buffet. There's a reasonable selection of sashimi, sushi and typical Japanese dishes. Food quality was ok without being exceptional. Service was a bit haphazard and we had a few minor glitches with the Samsung tablets. Used the Entertainer app to get a 1:1 deal and at that price per person this represents reasonable value. Not sure I'd visit again at full price

Efficient service and delicious food. Sashimi is fresh and wide variety of food available!Will go back again

Tried this Japanese restaurant based on the reviews. Had the all you can eat buffet. Pretty good deal if you are hungry!
I would come back if I am in the area!

bought 3x Yu Sheng Promo from Shin Minori and their service left me a good impression and thought would take an opportunity to have a meal there.Since its Vday and my buddy is in town, I booked for a table for 4. As there were a crowd, we waited appox 5 mins for a table which is pretty expected. Welcome with a smile by the lady boss and after by service staff Gary. I guess my previous purchases have made it easier for me to reach out to them.The food was served without much delay and hot. The only issue I have was with the tablet, which was a little slow. The salmon sashimi were fresh and thick slices. I love the soft shell crabs. The dessert served that night was unique and delicious. At payment, we are handled a gift which is Jap Table Lamp. Place alittle busy that very evening and so I would also not penalise the lack of attention given. For the amount I paid for 3 adults and 1 child, I must said that we made it worthwhile. Would go back for dinner someday

We were looking for a place for a feast on 1st January 2016, New Years Day, I proposed going for Japanese food so we decided to give Shin Minori a try after looking around for Japanese food.We checked the price $39++ for dinner on public holiday, price seemed alright.We had alot of food but only the sahimi is of quality.At the end of our dinner, we were told that our dinner is $49++, we didn't question the bill much until now. Maybe Shin Minori can kindly address this discrepancy in pricing.Another thing is we waited for quite some time before our food arrived, given that the restaurant is almost empty.Thanks

After a generally ok meal and experience, we had already paid and were walking about 50m away from the restaurant when one of the service staff shouted all the way from the restaurant door asking if we had paid. That was embarrassing and appalling on so many counts. Firstly, he could have asked his fellow staff first before shouting so loudly for everyone to hear, making it seem like we were evading our bill. Secondly, he could have come out to ask us face to face instead of shouting if he had wanted to clarify with us. Food wise, some were good some were average. Wide variety for the buffet, ranges from sushi to soba to rice and more. Service was generally ok and efficient enough. The restaurant uses a tablet for buffet ordering. Was going to give an Average rating until that appalling experience.

The price you pay VS the quality of food. sometimes it is just not justified. I have visited better restaurants. The service is bad. You can be waiting for 10 minutes or even longer and the staff would not have attended to you. Quality of food Vs the price is just not worth the stomach estate. I hope the work on the quality of food and service. considering that i is almost $42-45 per pax

Food quality was good but lack of variety compare to other jap buffet need to look into the menu selection not too much pork selection and someone like beef nt much in menu. Green tea ice cream we order was nt so gd was too sweet at first we thought was jus a matcha ice cream but it come with sweet bean way too sweet for us personally. Overall service is normal during dinning in the one guy who lead us to the table I forgot to ask his name he was friendly n very helpful the rest I think need abit of training couldn't smile much. Anyway overall experience is so so if compare to other similar restaurants u way below them. Food service was good that the plus point. Hope my next visit will see a better selection.

Went on new year's eve 2015. "Choped" a table for 2 with my husband. Restaurant did call the day before to confirm my reservation at 7.45pm. Service was not bad though my ice green tea-paid a dollar but refillable wasnt refilled till i asked but maybe cos it was pretty packed esp on ph eve so i m ok with it n the servers were pretty friendly too. But food is truly average not worth the $49++ per pax buffet - alot of sushi n few other items like fried tofu etc but frankly is it worth $49++?? Na...

All you can eat Japanese buffet is a good deal at $35 per person. Of course, come hungry! Portions are smaller than other Japanese places we visit. Also, watch the fine print. .. one order of sushi from the buffet " looks" like you will get two pieces but you only get one. Also if you don't eat everything you order, you get charged $10 per 100 grams. Make sure you eyes are not bigger than your stomach! By the way, ask for a table by the window... otherwise, it's very dark

especially enjoyed the sashimi, both quality and quantity. sadly the all you can eat buffet did not provide drinks or dessert, not even simple ones, it would have been nicer. we still enjoyed hot green tea with an additional SGD $1. so not bad at all.
4
Many items to choose from. Went on Xmas eve and the staff were all helpful and attentive. Worth the money to go!
5
My experience with shin minori is very Good! Food served is very fresh too! Will definitely come again!
4
great food and good for big groups dining. will be dining in shin minori again. recommended to go on weekends.
4
Sashimi is really good . Atmosphere is alright because our seats were in the corner like near the exit so it's kinda weird . But overall experience was ok. The staff is really nice as well. Good comes fast.
5
We have been here countless times and still the number one Japanese restaurant at least for me and my friends. They always serve the freshest sashimi and high quality sushi..... and not expensive at all!
4
The sashimi is excellent. Sushi is also good.
Service is extremely fast considering that the place is alway full!!considerinthat
4
Good food, good sashimi, decently fast service when it comes to serving your sashimi, unlike other restaurants.
Unfortunately, I find it a little too pricey. It cost almost 100 dollars (inclusive of GST and service charge) for just 2 person, for a weekend dinner.
4
Clean interior, good service and fresh sashimi. Good presentation of food. Food is very savory. Nice variety of sashimi, sushi, taco rolls, noodles and other dishes. Try the crispy chicken and sorbets. Beverages not included. Refills on tea. Adults $39 and kids $29. Service is quick and staff friendly.
5
We went for a lunch buffet, the food was fantastic, an incredible selection and all very fresh. Unlike most buffets it is not sat around getting all dry and horrible, it comes fresh as you order so the food is lovely and hot when it gets to you. As an experienced eater of sushi, I can say the quality of the seshimi, maxi, handrolls and everything else isreally above adverage for what you would expect from an all you can eat.The staff were great too and on hand to help, were generally polite and well mannered. Thanks again, we will be back again! :

One lowers his/her expectations if they go to an affordable a la carte buffet, but at Shin Minori, I was very pleasantly surprised to find really quality stuff, at unlimited amounts. They have a very wide spread and I enjoyed myself each time I visited. My only regret is when I step on the weighing scale the next da
5
Sashimi was very fresh and thickly sliced! Hot/cold green tea available free flow at only $1. Nice ambience.
4
Price reasonable & food were nice With lots of variety. Service was kind of slow. Need to order for same items a few times before it was served. Plus order device faulty
5
wide range of selections! food are fresh and tasty!
reservation in advance is a must especially over the weekend or public holiday.
always love the sashimi and able to witness chef slicing them in front of you is amazing!!!
2
Heard it's good so gave it a try. Ordered soft shell crab, the most pathetic I've ever seen, is so small! Is about 2cm in length. Ordered sashimi octopus, is ridiculously tiny too!
With the same amount, there are more places serving better food.
5
The selection of good available for the buffet is awesome, ranging from sashimi to grilled food. The sashimi here was fresh. They had no buffet counters. We had to order the food and it would be served to us, which is better as the food was prepared upon ordering
5
Many different varieties of Japanese food here. Sashimi and other raw fish are very fresh. The bbq grilled meats and mushrooms are also very good. We ordered close to 30 items for 3 persons! Service level at this restaurant was average. Do not expect anything more than bringing the food out to you and making payment. Every order was done via the Samsung tab.
5
The food was fresh. The service prompt and friendly. We were seated right away on a Saturday evening (reservation) and then ordered through iPads. The food came quick, and quite fresh. I love salmon and the salmon here was very good, with just the right amount of fat. We also had the cheese scallop which was very good and recommended. I also like the atmosphere here which is very home-y and "uncorporate" feel which is good. Overall the value for this place is excellent!

I went there on my birthday with my girlfriend and used their birthday promotion voucher. I brought along the email printout as the voucher stated which was actually required (I was lucky that I played safe instead of just using soft copy).The place is located at UE square which would require about 20 minutes walk from Clarke Quay MRT. But I would highly suggest wait for bus 54 just outside the Central. The ride will take at most 5 minutesThe food is above average. I especially like the sashimi moriwase and you can tell the difference from the quality of sashimi in cheaper restaurants such as the popular Sushi Express. The only horrible tasting food is probably their cold pumpkin dish. I also like that we can order from their tablet instead of having to call the service staff. This definitely helps reduce the service time and inconvenience of calling the staff. It will be helpful if the system could help tracked which order has been fulfilled, especially I usually order a lot in one goThe main issue lies with the service. There were only a few customers (3 tables occupied) during the time I was taking my birthday lunch, but it took me effort (at one point I almost have to shout) to get the attention of the staff. The staff lacked smiles also especially when we proceed with our payment.The boss definitely needs to train his staff in terms of service quality or else they will lose more customers. Singapore is a country where service buys you more customers compared to food quality when it comes to more expensive foodI would come back if there is another cheap promotion, otherwise at its default price, it is not really worth it due to their below average service quality and not so convenient location

Listen, it's an all you can eat Japanese buffet, ordered a-la-carte, for $40 SGD excluding drinks, taxes, and service. I think it's great, the quality of food is better than good, but not great, but again, what do you expect? We enjoy the tuna and salmon sashimi, miso soup, seaweed salad, tempura prawns and vegetables, chicken wings, and some of the chargrilled meats. If you go in with the right set of expectations, you won't be disappointed, you might actually even like it... I sure do
4
If you are really hungry but dun want to spend so much money for Japanese, this is the place! Quality of sushi is just fine. Service was good and fast... surprisingly. I will go back with friends to have beer or sake and lots of sushi.
4
scrumptious variety of makimono, agemono and yakimono..and not forgetting sushi n sashimi of course. price is worth the quality of food, ambience, service pretty efficient.
best to dine on a weekday i guess. definitely will return with more friends.
4
There are over 100 food items to choose and we only tried a few of them.
The sashimi was thick and fresh.
The tempura ebi was nicely fried.
The clam miso soup was excellent.
Nice ambience
3
Not so good cos food served nearly all at once
4
Variety is pretty good, fresh sashimi makes it really worth while. and for the price its quite a good deal
2
try nihon mura(cheaper) or kuishinbo (more variety)
3
decided to give this place a try but only managed to get seats after 2 failed occasions...single portion was too much. 2 ala carte grilled salmon steak n u are more or less full...the tako sashimi is not the type we would normally eat at other jap restaurant...from the slices u can tell the octopus is very small...every cut is estimated half a tentacle cant achieve the chewy taste...rest of the sashimi wise is ok. service was ok just tat we need to write our order on various categorized color menu slips. which is not very environmental friendly and its marked by pen.and its quite cold in there.

This is probably one of the bestJapanese a la carte buffet that I ever dine in Singapore. Order as much as you like. Excluding drinks and alcoholic beverages. Approx $40 inclusive taxes per person.Must try items - sashimi menu, prawn tempura and curry udon.I would rate this restaurant very good experience.The Service wasn't attentive and waitress always forgotten what order. Not paying attention to table. Fail to top up green tea. This probably because we have more than 20 persons. Service and attention to details must be consistent
3
Japanese restaurant offering an extensive menu at a reasonable all-in price. Diners are given 4 types of order forms to indicate their choices of raw seafood items, grilled dishes, etc. They can send additional orders thereafter. Desserts are available -- with an additional charge! We found the service good at first, but slower and less efficient as the restaurant became more crowded. Sashimi choices are rather limited, fresh-tasting and generally good in quality but not in presentation. Ambience and decor are satisfactory
4
I have patronised Minori for a number of years now and have always found their food to be good value for money. The quality is above average and the service is acceptable, considering that each person expects to pay about S$50 nett for all you can eat sashimi. If you are looking for a place to pig out on Japanese food staples, this is the place for you
5
Great japanese food here. We did the all-you-can-eat deal at $33 per head which we thought was great value. Staff are very attentive indeed, and we took our time to enjoy a varied menu. The food arrives just minutes after you've ordered it and there is a wide choice
