Chiu chow dishes were so unique, dishes varied from delicately flavorful to intense mouth sensation. All wonderfully executed by super friendly owners who take such pride in preserving this cuisine. The antiques displayed throughout the multi-story restaurant further enhanced the Chiu chow immersion.

Perfect place to blend the grandparents and grand kids. The owner spoke in teochew and made my folks felt at home. Curiosity drove the kids to ask more questions. And that was aptly handled by the owner who spoke in English too!Authentic food, perfect and unhurried service even though they were severely under staffed that night. Portions were generous and food was refined. Definitely worth many more visits.

This is a restaurant that I found a touch of the old Teochew cuisine. There are dishes on the menu and there are those that only by recommendation only. The recommended dishes are only those that are authentic Teochew cuisine dishes, like the fried noodle and crab. Besides the delicious food, the service is great. We not only get a room for us to enjoy the party, the owner is also proud to show us his collection and told us the story on how this place is set up. It is set up with a mission - to revive the Teochew cuisine with a heart
