Being a belgian and this being a belgian restaurant, I had high expectations that were met and exceeded. I recognized my grandmother recipes in the plates I chose. The portions are big and are nice to look at and taste follows. I recommend !

This is my 2nd time at the this wonderful bistro. I really really like the ambiance, love the food, great coffee, great desert and most of all Mr Anand and crew were really very good friendly and very attentive. Excellent service!
4
Location of the restaurant is probably not that accessible for those who are not driving but overall the ambience and foods are great!

Went there for lunch with a girlfren. Loved the decor, setting and the ambience of the bistro! Plenty of natural light. Will be back again and again - with friends or even just on my own to chill.
4
Very pleasant and comfortable atmosphere.just that the taste of the food needs to be a bit more consistent.

It's our first time to come here since we read good reviews in Tripadvisor. Not dissapointed at all!The bistro is located at the back of a beautiful furniture and design store with the same name. The place is cozy, bright and fresh. And most importantly, food is awesome. Price is mid-range, most main course is in end $20s. Will be back again for sure :

House of Anli is a small, modern restaurant tucked away on the top level of the Tanglin shopping centre. The food is always fresh and options are great, from fresh tomato soup (soup of the day), great salads (warm spinach is a must try!) lamb, exotic beetroot risotto etcCoffees are great too as are the desserts! The restaurant overlooks Tanglin Rd and the large trees that cover the embassy across the Rd. Ambience is nice with the walls decorated with modern art but can get cold as the aircon is regulated by the building and the the Restuarant themselves. Give it a try, you won’t be disappointed

Away from the shopping madness of Orchard Road in Tanglin Mall is the delightful House of Anli, just up the escalator to the first floor on the left hand side. What you get is an excellent homewares store followed by an even better Bistro overlooking Orchard Road and the lovely grounds of the Myanmar Embassy.The Bistro atmosphere is relaxed and casual and the staff extremely friendly. The Menu (which has been remodelled by Chef Shahnaaz Wong but maintains Anli's style of simple, tasty food presented beautifully) is highly appealing. I must say the Breakfast Menu looked amazing but as I was there for Dinner I couldn't partake so next time!For my starter I chose the Heirloom Tomato Salad which was a delight - a visually sumptuous stack of Tomatoes of every shape & colour where the taste fully matched the visual appeal! For my main I chose and enjoyed the Rib Eye Steak, cooked to my preferred medium rare to perfection. Furthermore the plating (see photo) was again visually appealing (very much "home garden style") & everything was absolutely delicious.Upon entering the Bistro I had no intention of eating Dessert but seeing as the first two courses were so good I ordered the Waffles (Belgian of course) which were thick & fresh with a perfect combination of crunch & softness. The Waffles can be accompanied by your choice of Maple Syrup or Ice Cream du jour (I had Cinnamon Ice Cream which was lovely!).So, overall a highly satisfying experience and I'll be back

The bistro is tucked away at the back of a home ware store. Although the wares are interesting, the bistro is a combination of relaxed and chic. Big windows let in natural light even on a wet Singapore morning. Breakfast as a teatime, 2 poached eggs, bacon and avocado. Tea and latte. Followed by a waffleI know sounds like any menu for breakfast (except the waffle)But the secret is in the details, the flowers are freshly cut and arranged. The flatware is heavy and beautiful, the plates are unique. Good quality condiments, and the musics is pleasant without being mundane and played at a volume that allows gentle conversation. Service, is warm and conversational - a rare treat in Singapore. An example, I wanted avocado with my poached eggs. Instead of a simple “yes”, I was asked if I wanted this sliced or spread. This was so natural, I doubt they even think of this as special. But it is... it’s a genuine quality of service that makes the day for a guest. Food. Produce is excellent. Well prepared. It’s a premium, but frankly... how many average breakfast does it take to appreciate a good one?Ssshh don’t tell too many people - it’s best enjoyed as a discreet secret.

What a nice surprise. My wife drug me to a home store for lunch and I thought I was being conned into a shopping trip. Instead, at the back of the store, is a lovely Bistro serving Greek food. Yogurt was served with lovely fresh fruit. Salad was also fresh and well presented. The moussaka was my favorite. I look forward to returning for the eggs Benedict. The dining area is filled with natural daylight. The only downside is that the food is not cheap. We spent over $50 SGD per person on lunch. Overall I happily recommend.
4
Good and European type of cafe. The atmosphere is fantastic, the lighting is smoothing. The lunch set is value added
4
A small and busy cafe. Food was delicious, except it was a little too cold. The environment is great, beautiful decorations and cutleries.
4
The food was thoughtful and flavourful. hosts were interesting, friendly and engaging. Only downside was the slow service!
3
Our food was all pleasant but not great so doesn't really justify the price. Love the surroundings although very few people in the evening and loud music doesn't compensate for a lack of natural buzz
3
Went for a family brunch. Service was alright, food freshly made, tasty and arrived fast. Nothing spectacular. Size of servings just ok. Quite pricy, though
5
Went with a friend and it was a lovely experience. The set lunch is good value and the food was excellent. Looking forward to the next time. Definitely a great place to meet friends!
3
Love how pretty and quaint the cafe was, totally instagram worthy and must come if you want to have some insta worthy photos. Service was however disappointing, didn't felt welcomed here, not much service to speak of here. I only ordered coffee here and it was not too bad
2
Noisy gathering of young mums led me to this gorgeous home interior-cafe on the third floor. Gorgeous looking restaurant but sadly food did not do it justice. Had a simple scrambled eggs with salmon on sourdough bread and a latte coffee but both nothing to write home about.Did I spot on the lunch menu sole at $40++? Rather steep pricing but the cafe was full. Probably worth a return visit some day
5
Carbonnades de bœuf was like what was back in Belgium! Tender with that simmering beer flavour! Portion is not big enough though and it would have been better to be accompanied with Belgian butter (e.g. Carlsbourg) and a few pieces of baguette or wholeneal bread (which was provided upon request). Avocado salad was simple and fresh. Had a good chat with the manager. Will definitely be back and hope to be able to talk to An(ne) Li(étaer) next time!
5
The dinner blew us away! We were unexpected to be served such delicious mains, not many know of this small bistro in town. The food leaves a deep impression. The beef was melt in the mouth, it was so tender at the touch of my fork. So was our starter..have never taste such soft n tender octopus. Great job
3
Lovely place with beautiful decor & ambience. Menu are Greek-inspired & simple. Although the prices are a little on the high side & the service is not exceptional, it is still worth a visit in this beautiful space.
5
Tucked in Tanglin Mall, this pretty café serves great delicious food. Their vegetarian-friendly beetroot risotto is done perfectly. Likewise with the grilled salmon and salmon tartare. I can imagine this place as a lovely hangout place in the afternoon with large window overlooking Orchard Road.
4
I must say, from the interior to the ambience, I did ask myself why did not discover this awesome place earlier. They serve organic eggs too!
4
I had brunch at House of Anli Bistro. Interestingly situated in a homeware shop, the food was done well, though the portions were a tad tiny. We loved the eel-egg-asparagus-caviar combination. Will definitely return at some point.
4
Cozy set up within a lifestyle shop, menu is limited, unpretentious and prepared well. Would recommend waffles with ice cream!
5
Tucked away behind a home furnishings shop this bistro is awesome. Bright, open, welcoming and friendly. The menu is limited but whatever you order tastes amazing because the ingredients are thoughtfully sourced. Especially grateful for the vegetarian items.
3
Took the Brunch from the Sea . Was good , but overpriced for the size you get. They should call it "Tartines" instead of Brunch.
Not amazed.
4
We went at night and it was pretty empty, but the food still took quite a while to be served! Ambience and service were good, and we were not chased to leave the restaurant even though it was already past closing time. We exceptionally liked the beef cheek as it was really tender. The moussaka was also worth a try.
4
Enjoyable lunch with friends, we had the lunch special which was very good. Felt though that the service is lacking - we always have to try to get the waiters attention, both when ordering or paying the bill, and they never come to check if all is ok. 
4
Thought I better write a second review after my first, scathing review, written just after this place opened. They have dramatically improved their service and I can happily report that the coffee and food is great (quite limited choice though - more of a light brunch / coffee place than a lunch place). Nice space and not too pricey for the area.
3
Unplanned visit and due to the atmosphere attracted us into cafe. Everything is good except the price and the portion, its expensive and the worth it.
Better alternatives elsewhere.
Wont visit again.
5
Booked a dinner reservation on Chope app. Was amazed by the service n food. Beef cheeks and salmon is highly recommended.. perfect place to have a warm cosy dinner with love ones... will def visit again. Thumbs up - louis

Fantastic scrambled eggs and sour dough bread. nice ambience. very friendly service. We went with our 7 week old for a late weekday lunch. Family friendly without feeling overrun by children. We will definitely be back.

As you expect with new openings, a few teething problems and service issues. We ordered, and then the waiter returned asking what was the order?!?!?! - despite writing it down. It was a longer than normal wait, particularly for an ice-water and pot of tea! Also, the pot of tea was half filled - that I didnt' understand - which I did find a bit naughty and somewhat skinflint miser like - as hot water isn't exactly expensive. I did ask for the hot water to be topped up, and again they half filled it … what is that all about ?! as it was still the one/same tea-bag! Despite chaotic, inconsistent service, and nothing running seamlessly (not our original order!) … our poached eggs on sourdough w mushrooms and prosciutto was very good. We are not big eaters so portion size was perfect for us, but I can imagine other patrons being dis-satisfied.They need a front of house manager, as they appear to be running around like headless chickens (english metaphor!) and the vibe was chaos …vs… established and relaxed chilled. eg: I watched 3 people look at our tray of tea and ice-water, but it was the 4th person checking the chit who finally brought it to us! Half filled pot of tea was well stewed by the time it hit our table

When invited to brunch, I thought my friends had made a mistake. All I could see from the Lift Lobby and escalator was a very nice shop displaying a good collection of home stuff. Then when I walked right inside the store, could I see the Bistro at the other end. With high ceilings, beautiful flower arrangements, and informal seating, the bistro was bright and cheerful. The staff were most warm, attentive and friendly. Food was good, thought the smoked eel was a tad dry and tough. The biggest problem all my friends experienced was the high volume of noise!! We could hardly hear each other speak, and so we had to raise our voices all the more, even to the person seated next to you. To have to do this for the 2 hours we were there, was exhausting and traumatic
4
In the back of their shop is this nice coffee shop.It gives you the living room experience and the waiters are very friendly.Drinks and food are quite basic but the ambiance is really nice for a quick coffee after or during your shopping.You have to find the location first though ;

We went for breakfast last Sunday after reading some reviews on the the internet and we weren't disappointed. The eggs and sourdough bread were as others have reviewed, delicious and well made, the bacon was crispy and melts in your mouth. We were also served by Anand, who gave us such a welcoming and delightful experience dining at House of Anli. Anand was also very patient and gracious in explaining to us when we had queries about our orders. My gripe, if any, would be that the place tends to get a little noisy when packed.Overall, it was a fantastic experience and we would definitely be back in future to try the other offerings on the menu
2
This is our second visit to Anli. It has a great ambience (if a little noisy - the loud music could be tamed...........butFor the price you excpet excellent food and coffee. First time we just had coffee which I rate 3/5. Why? Well it is to much like brown milk - smooth and creamy yes but no flavour.So we returned hoping that they had taken our earlier feedback on board re coffee. But no. And we decided to try the cakes. Now they may look good but the cheesecake and the apple tart were equally tasteless (except for the slightly strange taste from the tainted knife used to cut our slices I suspect - slight onion / garlic taste.When I complained to the maitre d" - nothing - no apology deduction on bill nothing. Poor very poor. Honestly there is much better food and coffee in Tanglin. In summary go for the view but nothing more

Newest kid on the block at Tanglin Mall, and a welcome addition!Love the belgian-inspired menu, perfect for breakfast (they open early) or lunch or tea.Chances are you have to sit at one of the communal tables, so dont expect a quiet lunch here.Great windows overlooking Tanglin road, it doesn't feel like we're in a mall at all.Service can be hit or miss, but the fact that the owners are in the restaurant every day should make a difference
4
Not apparently obvious as a very good quality cafe behind an upmarket interior design store, the simple all-day menu encompasses high quality and out of the ordinary sandwiches and modern breakfast with a few more substantial dishes. The asparagus soup was top rate. scrambled eggs on sourdough toast with avo was ahead of its peers, as was the coffee. Sole meunière superb although surprisingly they didn't gut the inners, and beetroot risotto was all that I could expect - if not more. By no means fast food at lunch time if your in a rush, and not cheap but by London standards all Singapore food is pricey. Open till 9 pm
5
I simply love everything in the store. From the bed linen to the silverware, the pillows the custom made bags designed by the owner. Everything is elegant, chic and desirable.
A perfect place to go when you need to do that special gift.
5
2 of the kids had the meatballs, 2 had the organic scrambled eggs, they rated it 10/10. I had the warm broccoli-goat cheese salad which was delicious. The bread is fantastic. We finished with the chocolate cake which is to die for. Warm welcome by the entire Lynas family, great service, cozy decoration.
5
Just had the most exquisite breakfast this morning at house of Anli's an amazing place with elegant pastel shades very pleasant ambience Locke and attentive staff but most importantly amazing food! I had the scrambled egg with Feta on the side along with a cappuccino and cannot honestly remember the last time I enjoyed breakfast as much.
3
The place is very nice and cozy with a shabby chic look ... I went there for breakfast with a friend. The place was not crowded yet, still we waited quite a bit to get someone attention. We ordered a very basic scrambled eggs, my friend asked the omelette version which was not in the menu: the waiter had to go ask the kitchen if it was possible to have the scrambled eggs in the form of an omelette instead!!Good, it was possible!We waited again quite a while (but we didn't bother as we were not in a hurry).The omelette came.I had to wave the waiter 15' later to ask about my scrambled eggs...There maybe an issue in the kitchen that needs attention.I would also say that I was expecting a bit bigger of an effort in the presentation, nothing fancy but that little touch that sometimes makes the difference between one place and another. In the plate just a slice of bread with scrambled eggs on top, that's it. Maybe a couple of leaves of salad or a couple of pieces of fruits for decor?I will go back to give it an other try because as said, the place itself is really inviting
1
Went there this morning for breakfast. After 50 minutes they admitted they had lost our order. Seemed completely out of control behind the counter. So, an hour with not even a coffee, let alone breakfast, does not a happy customer make. Seriously understaffed and badly trained wait staff. Sure has potential, but what a mess for now. Wasn't even that busy
5
Wonderful little Bistro. Very friendly staff. I sat on a stool with a good view of Orchard road and really enjoyed the ambience. I ate the soft boiled eggs, bacon and avocado and it was delicious. These eggs can be a little tricky to get right but they were perfect - warm and runny yolks just as they should be !

If you are looking for a very pleasant breakfast/brunch experience in the Tanglin area - you should try House of Anli. The front is a homewares retail outlet selling some very attractive household wares: crockery, cutlery, cushions, fabric and so on. Behind, in a large, airy space with lots of natural light, is the cafe/brasserie. My breakfast of poached NZ eggs and smoked salmon was perfect, and the coffee good. Friendly service and reasonable prices. More substantial meals are served, through the day until dinner time, and there is a selection of alcoholic beverages. The piped music (classical) was set at just the right volume. Well worth a visit
5
A great spot for a coffee or lunch with friends, also a good choice for a business lunch in the tanglin area. At the back of a bespoke homewares store (but don't let that put you off, it works!), the little bistro is warm and inviting with big windows and lots of natural light. We ordered risotto, moussaka and the chicken stew, all were really delicious. Authentic flavors and made with love. Food going to the tables around us looks delicious as well, with generous serves and lots of variety. The staff were friendly and attentive, a sad rarity in many cafes and restaurants in Singapore. Great coffee and fresh made orange juice too. Didn't feel like you were eating at a restaurant inside a shopping centre at all. Will be back soon to try more items on the menu.

I had never heard of this cafÃ© until a friend invited me to lunch here. I was very pleasantly surprised. It is hidden away behind a lovely furniture and accessories store on the top floor of Tanglin Mall. The decor is inviting with calm colours and enough space between tables to have a private conversation. The ingredients are organic and the service is warm and friendly. The cauliflower soup was a huge hit (as was the accompanying bread). The lamb on the 'from the farm' open sandwich was impeccably cooked and incredibly tender and the flounder was as fresh as could be and served with a delicious lemon butter and caper sauce. Sadly, we didn't manage dessert but they looked delicious.I look forward to returning to sample the all day brunch menu because the eggs looked perfect. This restaurant is a welcome addition, not just to Tanglin Mall but to the entire Orchard Road area where breakfast options, in particular, are extremely limited. House of AnLi Bistro offers a refreshing antidote to the other establishment that are overpriced with indifferent service. Looking forward to trying other items on the menu

This place is not easy to find, it's inside the House of AnLi store on the second floor at Tanglin Mall - opposite Gymboree. The cafe is spacious with nice views outside. I didn't try all the food but it seems quite close to a authentic French patisserie. The apple tart was very nice. Service was friendly but a bit erratic, it's a new place so I won't deduct a star for that
