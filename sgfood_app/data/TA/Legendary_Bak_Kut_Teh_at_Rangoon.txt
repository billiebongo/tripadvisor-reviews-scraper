We visit this place very often as it is near our house. Price is a little on the high side but the food is clean and delicious. Suitable for family with kids as well.
We spent an average of $9 per pax.

Tried so many type of Bak Kut Teh. This one is the best and vitalising! It is like healing soup and protein meal for me. Always miss their BKT after eating.

This restaurant has good taste. And the price was valuable. Employee was friendly. Menu has easy to order because it consist of picture and price clearly. I will be back for sure.

I love the taste of the soup here. The pork rib is great but not the best (its not that tender compared to the ones I really love).

Legendary was recommended by our taxi driver, as we were looking for a good place to have Bakuteh dinner. The place was a bit out of our way, but with no traffic, going to Legendary was a breeze. Ordered the legendary version of the bakuteh with the long and tender pork ribs. Meat is superbly cooked, tender and tastful. The soup is very tasty and served with refills. Also ordered steamed fish tail that was recommended by the Legendary staff and it was also very good and well prepared. The price is a bit on the high side and the restaurant only accepts cash

By chance my accommodation in Singapore was within walking distance of this local eatery. I was looking forward to eating Bok Kut Teh soup again, having first tried it years ago in Singapore. I was not disappointed, the soup here is delicious. I went 3 days in a row and ordered the same soup. I wish my stay was longer, I would have gone often. This restaurant is on my must do list for future visits. I'm craving it now

Good service, tasty food! Bak Kut Teh, mixed pig organ soup and braised pork trotters were the order of the day and all were excellent. Generous portions and frequent broth refills. The value for money is incredible especially considering this place is frequented by multiple celebrities - a testament to the owners and their hospitality.

PlaceMaybe out of your way but good restaurant to visit! They ravamped their furniture and renamed as well, better furniture! Of course, this restaurant is always clean!ServiceCan't complain! Not that great but u get what u need. They do give a genuine smile :)FoodI've been visiting this place over the past years, it has always been my go to for Bah Ku Teh. The taste is still good but i can taste a little change in the recipe as it's too peppery now that it burns your throat. It used to have the right balanced between pepper and garlic. I hope they cook the original back as it's way nicer!The pig trotter is also a good food to order to partner with Bah Ku teh!Overall, good place to visit. Keep the original recipe and people will keep coming back

Ate here a couple of weeks ago while on a business trip. Just discovered this restaurant while doing my evening walk, walked in, and gave it a shot. There were quite a few locals sat and eating, and a steady stream of customers, which is a welcome sign of good food, particularly in Singapore.I ordered a rib set - consisting of a bowl of bak kut teh ribs, a bowl of rice, some stewed peanuts, and some boiled veggies that tasted like pickled mustard leaves. Using my previous experiences with Bak Kut Teh as a benchmark - 5 Singaporean BKT and 3 MY/Klang versions, I still liked Founder's (at Balestier Rd) more, then this would be tied with the Klang-style BKT I tried at Lot 10 Hutong in KL. I really do prefer the Singapore variant, though I'm sure Klang diehards will protest, and mainly because of the peppery kick as opposed to the herby tinge on the Klang versions. Plus I'm a diehard adobo fan, and the Klang variant is a bit like adobo, so to me it's not like a BKT (even though it might even be the original version), more like a herbal Chinese adobo.Going back, the ribs were tender, the peanuts divine, and overall, my experience at Legendary's was quite satisfactory. The servers were snappy (though not as snappy as those at Outram Park Hua Ra Gua), the broth had a slight pepper punch, not muted like in Outram Park or non-existent like in Old Tiong Bahru, but still not as strong as the pepper punch in Founder's. But still, it was a good and filling meal

There are 2 types of Bah Kut Teh in Singapore. One is the herbal kind and the other is the peppery type. Founder is definitely the place to go if you love the peppery Bah Kut Teh. This is definitely my favorite! The ribs are soft and the bones just fell out of it with one bite. Dont forget to add the chinese doughnut and extra soup. They are delicious!

Pig trotters, BKT, authentic tea, delicious sides. Best part is you can brew your own tea on the spot, this is missing at most other BKT restaurant
4
Bak Kut Teh was nice, though I felt the pepper taste was too strong. But it's still good.
Restaurant is air conditioned. Service was excellent. Public carpark available nearby.
5
I've taken old friends, young friends, foodies and chefs. Every single person agrees this is one of the best meals they've had in Singapore.
4
To me, this bak kut teh restaurant is the best in singapore. The taste is very good. They have several branches in singapore. Price is not that cheap.
4
The Bak Kut Teh was good with a good soup base. Noodles on offer also, would have preffere the dry BKT but a good experience in a family run shop.

It's now called the Legendary Bak kut Teh. The usual must have dishes the salted garlic veg, braised peanuts, tofu skin, were great and difficult to get wrong and the combi Bak kut Teh, well maybe they didn't pour from the original pot of soup as the soup first bowl which usually is the best flavor is not quite what's it supposed to be. It's the more bland flavor. So I'm giving it just above pass. The soup is almost everything. But the meat was not over cooked like some. It was still succulent. My wife's pork liver a bit too raw but that's sorted out with another pour of super boiling hot soup. The Tia Kwan eng tea was infused well. I may come back but there is so much competition for good Bak kut Teh, and 25ms away you have another iconic one.

The bak kut teh was delicious. Tender, delicious pork (one of the best that I had ever tasted) with delicious soup. Portion is pretty small as well especially for guys therefore I ordered the bak kut teh baby ribs and founder bak kut teh. Meat is so tender and delicious. Highly recommended if you love bak kut teh however the side dishes was poor. You tiao felt like days old and soggy while the choy sim with oyster sauce was tasteless. Same goes for the braised egg. The place can be pretty pack, so be prepared to queue up. Would I come here again? Yes if there is no queue. Located in Balestier.If you think this review is useful , please click on the "helpful" button. Thanks !

This was run by a family. They are very hands on and very approachable, I just suggest they hire more staff that could speak or understand english.Food is excellent but a bit pricey. Maybe because this is very famous. You need to have reservation if they have because during lunch and dinner time they are quickly fill up

When we were first told about the concept of rib soup I donâ€™t think either of us were impressed. However this is hands down one of the best dishes we had in Singapore. The flavour was amazing, such a deep intense broth with succulent rib meat. Would have loved to go back if we had more time
5
Very easy to go from the MRT Farrer Park walk along the Rangoon rd. You can find it easily. We ordered the set of original bak kut teh and it taste good The sweet braised pork leg was terrific. I bought the instant powder and tried to cook it at home. ;( it's a lot different lol
5
happened to chance upon this bak kut teh restaurant and was impressed by its food! very good soup base and the pig trotter is definitely a must try.
5
We have ordered the ribs and the pig trotter, spinach and bean sprouts. Do ask for Chili padi and extra garlic to be served with the food. Food quality is always consistent. Service is attentive. Very good value for money.
5
Poor air-conditioned, not cozy, average presentation. However, what do you expect if they can provide you very delicious bak kut teh? Price is also reasonable.
5
This store is famous with visits from a lot of Movie Stars, TV Stars, Singers from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. Its star attraction is its Bak Kut Teh (Long Ribs) peppery clear soup style.
My daughter's personal favorite is the braised pig trotters.

It is a nice place, quite nice food too
But the price doesn't justify, so not really recommended to come again
5
The bak kut teh is excellent. This particular shop is run by the owners daughter. The service is excellent. Good to call in advance and book since it fills up quickly for lunch and dinner. Also try pigs trotter and the salted vegetables. Personally I prefer this to Ah Sio just down the street where service is not great
5
Ordered a bak kut teh, pork leg, salty vegetable, you tiao and 2 rice. The service is pretty fast (do come by before 7pm to avoid the crowd or if you want to sit indoors) and the food is good. Portions are also generous. One of the better bak kut teh in Singapore.

My 1st visit though have seen it around everytime I pass rangoon road. A little disappointing. Ordered the long ribs at $10 and was served only 3 pcs of it. The braised bean curd was too salty and not worth paying for a small serving of $4. When i asked why is it so salty none of the service staff could offer any explanation. I had to ask them to return the dish and take it off my bill as I could not eat it. The liver turn out just nice in texture which is not overcooked. Portion was reasonable for the price of $7. Overall the peppery soup base is not entirely my preference for bak kut teh
3
Came here on a Friday night and had to queue even though it was 8pm.Soup was alright. Peppery but the tea & pork flavour was not there. Ribs were of decent size and quality, but given the taste, perhaps not boiled long enough.Pricier than other shops probably due to the great rep it had.Wouldn't recommend going if you can avoid it

I was told this place is very famous and the are renounced for there Pork Soup. Personally not being a spicy fan it was a bit much for me, but if you love the very spicy side of life then this is a must for everyone. The staff here are great and very accommodating
