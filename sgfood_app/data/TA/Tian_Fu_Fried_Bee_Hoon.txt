This stall has been here for >20 years. Its very popular with office workers in Raffles Place. Expect long queues unless one come earlier like at 11am. Price is really very reasonable.

Great fusion of Chinese and Malaysian food @sub $4 per dish. Try Kang Kong(water Spinach), Rice Vermiccilli, Cuttle Fish.

This stall has been around for ages at the second level of Market Street Food Centre, popularly known as Golden Shoe. It serves fried bee hoon as well as egg, luncheon meat, fish cake, vegetable, sausage, etc. It also sells porridge. The prices charged is very reasonable, and is possibly one of the cheapest eats in The Central Business District. Do expect a steady queue especially in the morning rush hour when office workers buy their breakfast before going to office.
