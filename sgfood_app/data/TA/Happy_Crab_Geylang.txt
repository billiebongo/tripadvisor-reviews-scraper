You won't see many tourists or hardly expats in this part of town, but if you in the area, this crab is off the hook (ha!). If you like crab, outdoor-stall-wobbly-plastic-table-old-local-guy-with-one-eye-shut-smoking-and-smiling-at-you-whilst-you-dribble-over-some-delicious-cheap-style crab; than this is a perfect joint for you.

This place sells fresh Crab with mouth watering roe. The meat is firm & sweet. The roe is different from the normal roe & is the best that I have ever tasted. It comes with 3 separate sauces - wasabi, mayo & Belacan chilli. It would be a pity if you have not tried it. Highly recommended!!!Price wise is on a high side - depending on the size of the Crab. It starts from S$30 & above

Happy Crab Geylang located at No.641 Lor 33 Geylang, this is a pleasing neighbourhood seafood place..Down-to-earth and not somewhere u want to bring someone for a classy meal. It’s a basic place but it’s very busy with people. The tables and chairs are basic and there is a open area but if you’re on a average budget this is the place to come for great buzz and atmosphere to enjoy the lovely food that is on offer .Anyway if you are crab lover like myself, this place is great! It's the best quality crab meat in Singapore. Crabs are always super fresh, sweet and moist. We also had other dishes, and they all were scrumptious. But if u want great quality crabs in a pleasant no fuss environment then this is the place. Service was prompt given the fact that the restaurant was very crowded. .. We had a truly delicious meal which was very reasonably priced. The food was of excellent quality. The service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. I shall return

We stayed in the East for a night due wto proximity of airport and found this joint. Very nice crab, I could chose between $32-35 crabs and considered it good value. It's a stall like many in the neighbourhood and keep your eyes open or you'll miss it. The people there and the adjacent stalls were very friendly.

I recommend this place. The price for big one is 30 S$, the same size of crab in sea food restaurants on East Coast Park will be abt 70 S$... but here less glam place)). Happy crab move to new addres:Geylang 609 (corner of Lorong 31)

It was relocated to 641 Geylang Road near Lorong 33. The price increased but I did not regret. I chose the largest crab which cost $30. I love to dip the crab meat with Mayonnaise and soya sauce. In total, I spent $60 ordering 2 big crabs to ease my craving
