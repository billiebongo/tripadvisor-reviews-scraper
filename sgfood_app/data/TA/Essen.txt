Everything about this place is good. There's happy hour till 7pm. The beer is so popular I bet it's fresh.
It's a mix of office crowd and residents in the area.

Very interesting western food in a food court style environment. Order your food and Self-service all the way after. Food are very very tasty. 很特殊的西餐在一个大食堂的环境里。摊子订餐后就自助。食品美味。

Good food and drinks. The ambience is so perfect for some afternoon chill out in the park. My favorite hang out in the neighborhood.

Went for evening drinks to this small and cosy ‘Essen at Pinnacle’ food court on Ground Floor of a housing complex, Pinnacle at Duxton. There are just a handful of niche restaurants here but they are quite popular.Had an Somerset Apple Cider and also Asahi Black beer sitting in the open area of the food court. Very enjoyable greenery and st amidst tall trees. My wife ordered a Phad Thai from VietThai and I had French Fries and French Onion Soup from Garçons. All the preparations were delicious. Had a nice evening at this vibrant, moderately priced, niche food court

If you're German and new to Singapore and looking to sit down with a cold beer from back home, this is NOT it.Essen here is a small, family-friendly food hall with stalls purveying a range of mainly "ang-moh" dishes like duck confit, pork knuckles, burgers, and chicken wings. Think hawker centre meets pub.Beers cold. Drinks consist of the usual suspecs: Heineken, Erdinger, Carlsberg, give or take the occasional craft bottle or wine promotion. Non-alcoholic options are of course available.Music is terrible, boyband-heavy, mainstream national radio all day. No live sports either.Outdoor seating is limited, better to have your meal in a/c comfort

This place has a Food Court setting with a variety of stores that offers French, Italian, Thai, Vietnamese etc cuisine. We ordered Foie Gras & Escargot from Gracons, Beef steak from Burger Buddies & drinks (Alcoholic Root Beer & Ice lemon tea). For the price we paid, the food was heavenly! My hubby didn't like the 'special' alcoholic root beer though. Will definitely be back to try the food from the other stores

This is kind of an upscale hawker. There are quite a few food stalls so I can't comment on the quality of all of them. I had tried pizza and steak and found them tasty. There was a good selection of beer which we enjoyed. The place was not so crowded so we could hang out for quite a while. Overall, a good place to hang out. (Note that it might be hard to find a parking spot though.

The stalls from left to right: La Stalla (pizza & pasta), Two Wings (chicken wings), Viethai (Vietnamese & Thai), Plates SG (Western), Burger Buddies, Garçons (French), Essen Bar (drinks).It gets wayyy crowded nearer to 7:00PM on a Friday night!Happy hour is 11AM-7PM daily. Asahi Super "Dry" Black & Kronenbourg Blanc at $10/pint, & Asahi Super "Dry" at $8/pint, all on tap

went there to meet travelling friend we were looking for French kind of food at their request and on the cheaper side so picked garcon close to their hotel, and missed the hawker concept. Friday evening peak hour, that was a surprise. took us about 25mn to get a table with a bit of stress, but then we had a nice evening.inside with aircon crowded and noisy, but the "terrasse" was really nice - although of course at some point we had a large table of rowdy expat focused on their gallons of beer which raises the noise level again. aside from that, place is quiet, location wise. no car driving around, some sort of connecting park with a fair bit of greens. quite nice again.food, we came for garcon and were not disappointed. cannot comment on the pizza, burgers or fried chicken which obviously take the brunt of the demand. Garcon offers a pretty satisfying French style fare well worth the visit in light of the price practiced (duck rillette, coq au vin, mushroom salad, pork belly).no decent wine at the place i must say. but for a "hawker" the coverage of the beer stall in beers and ciders is astonishing.good place to return to, just avoiding Friday nights

Came by the Pinnacle at Duxton and chance upon Essen, a collection of food stalls housed under one roof. There are lots of imported beer, ciders, fruit beer and reg beer on tap. The food options are varied as well. Italian (pizzas and spaghetti), French, Vietnamese, burgers and the famous Two Wings (good but over priced). Great Atmosphere for a casual gathering. Can be noisy if filled. Not a bad option if u are near this place.

Moist roast chicken on a bed of endadame beans, mushrooms and salad. (I requested no carbs). Turned out to be wholesome delicious and healthy lunch. S$15.90. Fairly good value meal in a decent uppity food court ambience.
4
It's kind of a posh hawker with about 7 different places selling pasta, chicken wings, Thai, seafood and European food. They have a well stocked bar with good value wines and beers.
5
The French food and wings are Super yummy and I love it. Good place to have a good gathering with friends.
5
This is my favourite place to chill and relax with friends.
They have this unique concept of food centre with good booze.
You can find western food, asian and french food.
we love their chicken wings - beyond words.
better come in the evening
5
Always come here for the chicken wings. Also have wide selection of beer. This place is very happening! Nice place to chill.

Everything about this place is good. There's happy hour till 7pm. The beer is so popular I bet it's fresh daily. It's a mix of office crowd and residents in the nearby estates. Every stall is great except one. Why? My green curry has an identity crisis. I think it wants to be bo bo char char.

The food is yummylicious and tasty. Good place to dine and hang out with friends and family.Variety choice of food, eanging from pizza, chicken wings, Vietnameand Thai Cruisine, western food, burger and french food.The price for food and alchohilic is reasonable. Been here for many times

Went back to Essen yet again and tried Burger Buddies. The store, manned by a lady so looked and sounded like she hated her job should have been the biggest warning sign to walk away but we just had to try something new.It was a relatively large burger with a pretty thick patty, scoring quite well in the looks department, I had some hopes it would be good but it turned out to be a major letdown. The patty was bland and slightly gamey and topped with an unidentifiable cheese that could have been a spray on. The bun was almost hopeless as it became a soggy mess halfway through the meal and a quarter of it was left abandoned.Thankfully, we ordered up a batch of chicken wings and a few pints of beer and that saved the day. Recommendations - the stall selling chicken wings still saves the day and the beers have never failed me yet

located at the foot of the pinnacle (you dont have to walk through the condo premise). initially a quaint place with warm lighting to enjoy the happy hour but it gets noisy because there are so many people there to enjoy the happy hour. other drinks are quite reasonably priced too. choose from french fare, korean, italian and general western from the handful of stalls there. self-service (fetch your food when the buzzer buzzes). chicken wings seem to be the top choice. plates and trays were cleared promptly by the friendly cleaning staff

This was our second visit to Essen and compared to our first visit, there seemed to have minor improvements made.The place did seem more "packed" like they were trying to squeeze in as many tables and chairs to maximise capacity. On top of the loudness of everyone talking, there seemed to be a sound system that was blaring out music, making conversation a little challenging, unless you were practically yelling, or talking really loudly.The only decent food still seems to be the fried chicken wings, the pizza we ordered were ok at best, not memorable. The mac & cheese was slightly unpalatable and ended up hardly eaten.The Thai food stall was a severe hit or miss. The fish cakes were pretty good and we ordered seconds while the rice dishes tasted like they were cooked using some pre-mix.Overall, a pretty alright place, avoid meal times when it gets overwhelmingly crowded and really noisy. The food is passable, the drinks on the other hand, are awesome. We'll be back for drinks for sure

A quiet corner at Tanjong Pagar. A variety of different food. The buddy wing meals was yummy. Also offer a variety of crafted beers. Another place for chilling..
4
All in all a great place with good food, beers, wine and reasonable priced. Oysters are very recommendable. Great indoor and outdoor seating.
Toilet is a mess at that place.
4
A high-end food court in a chic location in Singapore. Various stalls selling pork belly, pasta, duck confit etc.
If nothing else, go for the Asahi dark beer and couple of finger food and have a nice chill out.

Love this place. Food is yummy, good drinks selections and good pricing. Only downside is that you need to wait a long time for your food. But we didn't mind since the place is nice and relaxing.

Great option for western & Asian food in funky food court setting. Well stocked bar with reasonable wine list and craft beers.Lovely to sit out the front on the Duxton Plain and enjoy the balmy tropical nights and watch the world go by while sipping on a glass of wine or downing a beer.
4
The place is located in Pinnacles block D. Can be a bit tricky to find. The french food at the stall called Garcons was very good. We ordered the ox tail stew, rilletes with baguette and pesto rice. All tasted very good. The ox tail melted in my mouth. There was a good variety of beer available. We also ordered some wings from Two Wings. They were greasy with a bitter after taste. The sweet potato fries was good. We had Thai desserts from Kin Khoa. The chendol and red ruby with vanilla ice cream were yummy. A sweet ending to a good meal
4
The place does not look like other food courts in Singapore. It is a good place to hang-out with friends. There are good choices of food. We love the popcorn wings and ice lemon tea. Smoked duck pizza is nice but it is a tad too salty.
5
I have tried the Italian and Thai stalls (both good quality) as well as Two Wings - i can't stop ordering from them on Deliveroo - very nice fried chicken & fries - love the spicy sauce and popcorn chicken. I like the Ice Lemon Tea from the Drinks stall too

Made a visit to Essen at about 10:15 pm to order a couple of drinks. We liked this place very much for its location, nestled quietly in the lush green backyards of chinatown, and also for its choice of relaxing music played, making a perfect ambiance to unwind, or so we thought. We had asked the bartender its closing time, and was told 11 pm. Perfect, until one of the staff starts getting busy with the chairs and tables around us, just after we sat ourselves down. Slowly we felt them evaporating around us one by one as he inched closer and closer to our vortex of relaxation, like an impending virus ready to gobble us into the chains. We felt so uncomfortable that we had to leave the premises with our drinks and move to the park nearby
