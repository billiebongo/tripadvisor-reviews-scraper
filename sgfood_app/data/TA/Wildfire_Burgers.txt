Quite okay. Medium size portion, taste good. Price a bit expensive for that size. Located in somerset, orchard.

Delicious Tripple Bacon Burger is a must have. Service is good, price - little bit on higher side. Definitely recommend.

Visited with my wife and tried the classic burger. Nice, juicy and tasty. But the bun was very oily. Not sure what happened there but it definitely was not to our liking. Nice beer selection but expensive (ie. Touristy expensive). Price maybe on par with some bars in the area. The area itself is noisy as it is just above Somerset mrt and a lot of people stop here to eat and shop. They have their own "specialty" burgers but the list is not as extensive as other burger joints.

Ordered with UberEats and was pleasantly surprised!Burgers are really delicious and the fries have a really good seasoning. I ordered the truffle burger and my wife had the sriracha chicken. Both were excellent, though I rated the chicken much higher. A bit on the pricey side, but worth the price

Beers here were fantastic! We had the two IPAs. Burgers were good, not great. This review is primarily about the service we received. We really enjoyed the service of Wellyand Wilson, and loved their enthusiasm and their recommendations. Welly, of his own accord, offered to let us try a few of the different craft beers on offer, with an individual introduction to each beer and the nuances. We ordered a pint on the tap each. Wilson recommended burgers to us with lots of candour, telling us that some customers couldn't tell the difference between the normal burger, and the more highly priced Wagyu burgers. On the other hand, we received extremely poor service from Lenny - the store manager. 1. While Welly was introducing us to the beers, she shot us really dark looks like we were trying to "free load" beers. 2. When we wanted to add on fries, she chided us for not ordering them earlier with our burgers. 3. When I got an unopened bottle of beer by mistake (I had assumed that it was a draft as that was what I had requested for), she was really upset that I requested to change to a beer on the tap. Points 2 and 3 required minimal efforts to rectify (tell the kitchen to cook more fries/bill us more to top up from an unopened beer to a beer on the tap), but the store manager actually saw fit to grumble and have a go at us, as first time customers, and accuse us for these "mistakes".It made us wonder why she's the store manager, over Welly and Wilson, who served us with so much enthusiasm and friendliness throughout the night. Owner of Wildfire Burgers, if you are reading this - Singapore needs more Wilson and Welly in the service industry, and less Lennys.

There are lovely, big trees outside this restaurant - and that is why I went in the first place. The burgers were OK,, not wildly good. The staff were friendly. The worst thing about this place is fhe building. It is not well maintained and unfortunately the restroom isn't in the clean and cheerful restaurant but in the building. The sorry state of fhe restroom took away some of my appetite! The trees are gorgeous, though
3
The burger was quite tasty, although quite fatty, which kept dripping out and soaking into the bun - I happen to like the 'unhealthy' burger like this, but some might not.Service was quick, the burger then arrived in super-quick time, so wouldn't complain about speed and service at all.I would visit again if I was in the area and fancied a burger, but I am sure there must be better burgers in Singapore.In summary, nothing amazing, but quite reasonable. I have definitely had better burgers, I have definitely had worse too. Above average, but not by much

Went here with my friend after flying in from Taipei. We checked in late to our hotel and Wildfire burgers was recommended for a late bite. As we arrived one of the staff was carrying out 4 huge empty gallon cans of Tempura Oil. Ordered the classic burger x 2 and when it arrived the brioche buns and burger itself were awash in oil. The raw ingredients were good but all I could taste was oil and the fries were the same. Really disappointing - â‚¬40 for 2 burgers,fries and 2 beers. The owner needs to give the staff a serious refresher on food prep
2
Good ingredients put to terrible use. I hadn't had a burger in 3 months of traveling in India and this was such a disappointment. If you know what a good burger should taste like, don't eat here. Not to mention the burger was tiny. At first my burger came out cold and raw in places and I asked for it it be better cooked and it came back out mini sized.At least I now have an answer for the worst burger I ever ate (I was hungry - haha
3
Great concept as gourmet burgers are coming back. They focus on quality and preparation, cooking etc.. but the end result ?? Honestly, trying a bit hard and the mix doesnt quite work. Dont get me wrong, the ingredients are fresh and good but just the combo. Tried better ones out there at better prices
4
After a long Sunday morning walk in the nearby Botanic Gardens we discovered this place. Fast, friendly service. Great food.
4
Had burgers there twice..and each time was an enjoyable experience..tasty beef burgers, reasonable serving size and food quality..service was amicable and prompt..quite a compact eatery though..yes, would recommend this place for beef burgers..
3
Reasonably good. The offer for Wednesday is one for one wagyu burger. I remembered the burgers are much bigger on other days. A wide selection of artisan beers to go along with burger. I like restaurants to provide water without charging.
3
Whoever charges $5.00 for a small coke and 13.00 for pint beer deserves to be harshly critiqued.
Food below average.
Drinks way to expensive.
Nope !

My Husband & I were after burgers for lunch and randomly stopped here for lunch.The menu options were good. Delicious to read! The service was very poor... For $25 for an of burger & chips - our orders came cold to the table & 5 minutes apart and we'd ordered exactly the same dish each! I had ordered root beer which came in a can and they brought me a glass but I had to pour it myself... No cutlery or sauce on our table when they served food and I had to go get the napkins & cutlery...Perhaps the food could have been tasty but as it was cold - for $25 it was bad!I have had better service, tastier fries at McDonalds!!Quite disappointed - absolutely no value for money!
3
We were very impressed by the quality of the burgers we had. Delcious wholesome burger patties but the fries were just so-so. The waiters were not very attentive and had difficulty understanding what we wanted - this was quite disappointing. Won't be coming back here so soon..
4
Burgers were great! We ordered the French onion and the works. Broche buns were a little oily but the beef patty was cooked just right. Chips were nice too. You can change the regular fries that comes with the burger for one of their specialty fries for just $1.5
4
I've just visited Wildfire for the very first time a few hours ago and I was impressed. The meat patties were extremely juicy and had this wonderful smokey flavour. The fries were perfect: Enough crispiness, enough moisture. One little "complaint". When I arrived at Wildfire I was totally soaked from the torrential rain outside and I was wishing for a hot coffee, to my surprise they didn't have it (or did he say coffee was sold out for the day?) Beside that little hiccup, I survived. In fact I had a pretty good time. I definitely will return to try out other food items.Do take note they charge prevailing GST but no service charge, as everything is self service
3
I went here early on a busy Saturday evening but managed to get a table immediately and I ordered the Classic 001 Burger which arrived with chips included and a pint of draft Heineken to go with it.I was hungry so not too fussy about the quality of the burger which was good if a little greasy but not great. The fries were okay.Very little atmosphere but that was to be expected as this is more of a fast stop food junction rather than a restaurant for chatting and relaxation.Singapore prices here, the pint was fourteen dollars and the meal sixteen

At 11am, it was rather empty. I love the homely vibes that this place exudes with its warm wooden hues and yellow lighting. The music was also pretty unobtrusive, noticeable, but not too loud to distract you from your conversations. Though there was an outdoor seating area, we preferred being in the air-conditioned comforts of the indoor dining area. I had a sudden craving for poached eggs that day, but it just wasn't my day. First, the server told me that Wildfire didn't have Eggs Benedict. Then, when I changed my order to Swiss Rosti, I had to change my choice of eggs from poached to scrambled once again. My friend ordered a Crunchy Brioche French Toast with crushed cornflakes, natural yogurt, blueberries, strawberries, honey roasted walnuts and maple chantilly cream. The toast was really thick and we enjoyed the crisp outer layer with the maple syrup the most. The inside was rather fluffy but it got a little too bland for us after the first few bites. I suppose the greek yogurt (unsweetened), berries and nuts made it a healthier breakfast alternative. I got myself the house made rosti with sour cream, scrambled eggs, salad tomato chutney and Kurobuta Toulouse pork sausage. The rosti definitely tasted better than Marche's for it was crispy and well-flavoured, but it wasn't held together as well. It disintegrated the moment I tried sticking my fork into it. I would say that their scrambled eggs were done to a nice consistency, so even though it isn't exactly a perfect replacement for poached eggs, it was close enough to satisfy my tummy. The tomato chutney was decent and the and sausage was surprisingly nice, with a subtle black pepper taste. I'm not a fan of the baby spinach though.We added another side of umami fries. The "secret umami dust" reminded me of McDonald's shaker fries' powder. It had a nice earthy truffle-like smell to it, and little sprinklings of seaweed, anchovies, bonito flakes and kombu. They were pretty generous in scattering the umami powder on the crisp fries. I have to admit I love their fries. Who cares about calorie restrictions when you get to eat such heavenly fries?Food took around 10-15 minutes to be served. Service was quite alright too. One great thing about Wildfire is that you can get your own water and extra condiments from their dispensers near the entrance. Overall, it wasn't too expensive. Expected damage would be around $20-25 per pax. Rather decently priced, I would say. It's a great place for catch-ups, chill-outs and cosy little gatherings. :

The burger here is great. Service was also quick enought and the burger was grilled very juicy and tender.
Fries were good as well but could be better.
Centanly for a burger I can come again with friends or alone.
3
Had the Classic 001, bun was nicely done but the pattie was rather dry. The burger could do with a little more caramelised onions to balance the dryness of the beef.
Nice selections of beers though.
3
The food was okay, I got the Portobello Mushroom burger which was good, although the bun was quite dry and powdery. The staff definitely need more training in customer service, just little things like lingering at the table a little longer than needed when food is delivered, lack of confidence when speaking. This place is new so I think it is just teething pains. The fries were good though
4
As in other reviews, burgers were great: well cooked and balanced flavours. Kale salad was particularly good too. The staff were very keen to make enjoyable visit. They were friendly and helpful.I'm still baffled by the insistence on self-service for food though. It seems in Singapore to be perceived as an unalterable aspect of a 'burger bar' when on a number of occasions its not only unnecessary but almost awkward to collect your food when there's more than enough staff to bring it over.I'll still be back though
2
I have just had a meal at Wildfire burgers on Orchard Road in Singapore. Positives are the location and staff. Negatives are they do not accept all credit cards, they do not have any wifi "pay at the table" facility and the food seemed cold. The taste of the food was ok, but every bite made me think "is this fully cooked"? Probably will not visit again
2
I had lunch here with a friend recently & we each ordered a different burger. We'd heard a lot about this place & were keen to try. Even though there were positives such as freshly baked brioche buns & handcut fries, Wildfire failed to deliver on the most important element. The patties of both burgers were charred & over cooked. They virtually crumbled in our mouths & lost any trace of juiciness. For this reason alone, I cannot recommend Wildfire.
5
Love the burger here. Service was quick though as if the burger had been grilled on earlier for preparation. I thought i might expect the burger to be done on the spot but still delicious!! For the fries, that was too quick and not crispy though(i love it when it's got and crispy)Had a light beer. Hitachino Nest by draught. Overall, i will come by again with my friends.
3
We'd always walk past Wildfire on our way to Assembly. One day, we decided to stop in for lunch.The burgers looked very tempting. I ordered a classic burger and my wife ordered a lamb burger. My daughter wanted to try out the Chicken pops.My burger was fairly decent but lacked that special something that would make me want to come back. My daughter's chicken pops were average. My wife's lamb burger however was terrible. The meat was dramatically underdone and tasted terrible. She could not bring herself to finish it.Overall, not a venue I'd visit again
5
What isn't there to love? Awesome burgers, great snacks - meat balls were amazing, kale salad anyone? Great fries and wash it down with a craft beer and at reasonable price!Our favorite burger and beer joint and we have to travel 45 to an hour for the pleasure each time
3
Disappointed in the experience........nobody really told you what to do when we sat down, we finally figured out you need to order up front and get a beeper, wait for your food. Burgers would have been better if someone asked how we wanted them cooked, they all came out well done.Fast service though, and a good selection of beers but I would not bring a date here unless you know her well! Bill was not cheap, not expensive. Kind of an average evening
4
Casual dining place with decently priced steak and burgers. Great collection of Japanese beers. The simple menu works for them and allows them to focus on quality
5
We tried several of burgers on offer and they were of excellent quality. Combination of meat, flavouring and garnish done just right. Beer selection really impressive too.
3
Popped by for late lunch. Wife ordered a classic burger and she was quite happy with it. Since I don't take beef, I can't comment much. I ordered a Srirachi Chicken burger. Bun is soft and meet is tender. But the seasoning didn't quite get into the meet. It is also a bit too salty for my liking. Overall, it is still above average. Price is reasonable for the quality.They should do something about the aircon though. It wasn't crowded but it was really warm even u are seated indoor
4
This is a relatively new eatery but one of the better burger joints in Singapore. The portions are substantial and are priced accordingly. There is a wide selection of beers on offer both on draft and by the bottle. Outside eating is available but space is limited
5
This is my fifth or sixth visit in the last 3 months. Only remember I have savored all 3 meal times but forgot to write about it. Its fresh, tasty and satisfying. I have settled down on 001 as my favorite for BOTH lunch and dinner. Guess I am a traditional burger kind of guy but the temptation to try others will come soon enough. Its not burgers though for breakfast and I got ridden over by the Rosti offering. If anyone thinks I live upstairs from the restaurant or just across the street let me put it on record I live more than 5 KM away and that also takes me out of the delivery range for Wildfire's new delivery service. Sad but that shouldn't take any stars away on a truly great burger restaurant and a really hearty (albeit non Chinese) breakfast. Keep it up guys

The Dry Aged Angus burger ($26) was and still is my favourite burger on the menu! Featuring a Rangers Valley dry aged angus patty with butterhead lettuce, sliced tomatoes, beer caramelised onions, cheddar cheese and their Signature Master Sauce - I don't know how they do it but this is an absolute party in your mouth! The intense flavour from the melting cheddar coupled with the tender and juicy patty... it is little wonder why it's rated the top 3 burgers in Singapore! More photos and detailed review on my blog http://floraisabelle.com/wildfire-singapore

After reading so many positive reviews about this place and being a big fan of burgers, I headed down with my hubby and daughter. We ordered the signature burgers - The Works, Wagyu Burger, The Triple Bacon and a side of kale salad. When we got our burgers, I noticed my burger pattie was super tough and dry. Daughter and I ordered medium and both were pretty well done. Hubby ordered a medium rare and guess what, it was well done as well. In the end, we left most of our burgers untouched and nibbled on the buns and fries. Luckily, the kale salad was decent. I did not bother to complain or return the burgers as we waited for quite a fair bit and weren't prepared to spend more time waiting. I felt we just wasted our Sunday family dinner on one of the worst burgers I ever had
3
I ordered the French Onion burger and my friend ordered the triple bacon burger. Very well presented , but the flavors aren't there. Maybe the meat doesn't have enough fat content or it isn't seasoned enough, but we both just though the burgers were ok. Beer on tap was great! They had Hitachino from Japan (white ale and amber ale) and Prairie artisan ale from Oklahoma

Superb sriracha chicken burger - moist spicy chargrilled breast with pickled carrot and bacon in a brioche bun. Absolutely delicious. My fellow diner had the wagyu beef burger and was similarly impressed. We had not expected this and were just hoping for a nice tasty burger for dinner. We ate out the back, which was nice without being anything fancy. Easy ordering at the bar from a simple, well-explained menu.

I just ate at Wildfire Kitchen + Bar and thought it was the absolute worst brunch I have ever had. My boyfriend and I decided to try the restaurant after its amazing delicious and very busy neighbour Assembly had no tables available. Upon ordering the Eggs Benedict I was told the kitchen was out of poached eggs, to which I replied, are you out of eggs completely? No, just the poached kind. What does that mean exactly, you have no pot of boiling water? You have no vinegar or salt in which to poach the eggs? Or is your chef just too lazy to poach an egg? Whatever the case was with the missing poached eggs, I went with the Corned Beef Hash and was excited enough to try that. I pictured a scrumptious serving of firm and crisp corned beef fried with onion and potato topped with an egg, much like the amazing and delicious version served at Sacha and Sons. Sadly what I was served was a scoop of room temperature cafeteria like mush or what I assume was just hamburger filling mixed with some potato bits and fried for a moment or so. This scoop of meat was served beside my so called sunny side up eggs which were dreadfully undercooked, the entire top was clear liquidy boogery white. I asked to have them cooked a little longer to which the server said "that would be over-easy". Guys I can't stress enough that sunny-side up eggs is not slang for undercooked eggs, it just means they are fried on one side until cooked, you can cover the eggs with the lid of a pot to help get this right if needed. I did not eat the over-easy eggs they brought me back, nor did I eat the meat pile on my plate. Luckily my boyfriend had ordered the same thing and let me know how absolutely horrible it was beforehand. In a nutshell, if one cannot cook an egg, or has never tried corned beef hash, one should not put those items on a menu.Maybe the burgers at Wildfire Kitchen + Bar are great, I will never know. I can only tell you to avoid eating brunch there at any cost. Please go anywhere else. The LoKal, Assembly, and Forty Hands are my personal favorites

The burgers here are pretty good. Meals are a reasonable size although prices are in the $25+ range so they should be.
Be aware you need to queue to be served at a single operator register and they dont take credit card.
5
Tried the Wagyu burger and the taste was superb. Meat was juicy and tasty, and I loved the sourdough buns that went with it. Really Yummy!
5
Tried the ultimate wildfire burger Juicy patty and amazing bun with incredible accompanying ingredients the burger is to die for.
5
Love the steak and beers... you can't get it from any where else!
The ambience is great! Suitable for couple who wants romantic times and allow friends would enjoys among themselves. It is friendly with family with kids as well.

The burgers looked fantastic and the price was not bad compared to similar places in Singapore. The burger unfortunately didn't deliver. I wanted to like the place but the burger was just OK. Maybe I will come back for breakfast or try the chicken burger. They have a great selection of beers but the burger just didn't have any taste. I got the french onion burger and was expecting a strong tasting burger especially because it had gruyere cheese. I was underwhelmed and so was my friend that ordered the triple bacon burger. It's hard to mess up a burger but it's also difficult to make a memorable one

I visited Wildfire with my husband and toddler. Based on my experience, I'll suggest to parents with small children to leave their little one(s) at home, if possible, when they visit Wildfire. Here are my reasons:1. There is no kids' menu. Sharing your plate with your child will be a literally unsatisfying option because the serving size is just about right for an adult.2. It's a self-service restaurant. If you are with your toddler by yourself and your table is in the area at the back (a high likelihood because there are only 3 tables in the main restaurant area that can accommodate a high chair), you will have to keep leaving your table to return to the main area to: a) place your order at the cashier, b) get your iced water, cutlery and condiments (one trip may not be enough), and c) collect your burger when the pager buzzes. If your toddler has separation anxiety, all these getting up and leaving the table can easily trigger an anxious toddler's meltdown. A tasty lunch and a testy toddler just do not go well together.3. The high chair that was provided to me was not clean. The inner right side of the white high chair was stained by a sprinkling of red substance (Juice? Ketchup?). To be fair to Wildfire, it's not the first or only restaurant to make me pull out wipes to clean a dirty high chair myself. But I wanted to point this out because things like this matter to some parents.As for the food, we ordered the two specialty burgers on the menu: Wagyu burger ($26) and the dry-aged Angus burger (also $26). I've read good things about the dry-aged Angus burger and came with high expectations. Perhaps the patty on the dry-aged Angus burger was a wee bit overcooked or my expectations were pegged too high because of the rave reviews but I found the dry-aged Angus burger to be a bit underwhelming. I was however very pleased with the Wagyu burger, which was juicier and more flavourful than the dry-aged Angus burger. Perhaps when it comes to meat that has been turned into mince, it is primarily the fat content that makes all the difference, dry-aging or no dry-aging. Anyway, if I need a burger fix, the Wagyu burger at Wildfire will always cut the mustard for me.The fries were crisp and well-seasoned. Not your super fancy triple-cooked chips, but they were good enough to go with the burger, which is the main event after all. One other thing I appreciate about this restaurant was that the kitchen got the food ready quite quickly.Would I recommend Wildfire for its burgers? Yes, definitely. But do leave the little kids at home. And that's exactly what I'll have to do when cravings for Wildfire's Wagyu burger next seize me

Actually named Wildfire Kitchen + Bar, it is located on Evans Road, sharing same building as a pre school. It is a casual self-serve restaurant offering gourmet burgers, chargrilled steaks and they have more than 60 types of craft beers.Premium burger patties include the Rangers Valley dry-aged beef and Wagyu. Payment by cash or NETS, interesting choice of EDM for music within the premises. Limited seating in the front, but there are more tables in the back.If you like gourmet burgers which are not too small in serving, this is the place to try it. Fries were average, but the onion rings were pipping hot when served
4
Nice place that has only been open a few weeks ago. Was with my two parents and we all had great burgers. I had read that they were very good and the burgers themselves stood up to their reputation. Found the self-service system in the restaurant quite different, but interesting. Will be back again

After a walk at the nearby botanic gardens, my friend and I had a leisurely breakfast at Wildfire, which had just introduced their new breakfast menu. We ordered their wildfire breakfast as well as their french toast with maple chantilly cream, and some tea and coffee. The food and drinks were ready in no time at all, and looked really good! (See photos) We shared both dishes, starting with the wildfire "big breakfast". That was huge, with 2 eggs done anyway you like (we chose sunny side up), a very good quality sausage and bacon fried just right (not too greasy and just crisp enough). There was also a nicely grilled tomato, sautÃ©ed mushrooms, baked beans and a side of lightly dressed baby spinach which was very fresh. And 2 small pieces of sour dough bread, toasted. It was all very satisfying and delicious! The only thing I thought could be improved was the toast which (at the risk of sounding greedy) were rather small pieces and toasted a bit too crisp for my liking. My personal preference would be for 1 larger slice, lightly toasted and served on a side plate instead of on the already overflowing plate. At $19 I thought it was good value (I was so full I did not need lunch!). After polishing off the savoury big breakfast we moved on to the French toast. I was afraid it would be soggy since we did not eat it immediately, but it was still crisp, thanks to the fact that it was coated with crushed cornflakes. The presentation was lovely with generous serving of blueberries and straeberries. I thought initially that there was too much chantilly cream, but it was just right and we could taste maple syrup through the cream. The French toast was a brioche, rich and delicious. One of the best French toast I've had.In terms of ambience, it was quite charming and trendy. We sat behind which was not airconditioned. Lots of fans so it wasn't too warm. I would have preferred it if the food and drinks were served to us, instead of a full self service. Overall a nice quiet restaurant for a leisurely breakfast, which I understand is available at lunch time too. But for lunch, I would want to have their yummy burgers

Fabulous wagyu burger and the French fries is as lovely! The beer selections is extensive so make some effort to try different ones. Although the beer menu located at the counter can prove a little inconvenient but we managed to try 3 different unique Japanese beers during the dinner. Perfect complement to the wagyu burgers. The wagyu burgers is as delicious as it looks in The Sunday Times! So looks in this case is not deceiving. It is what you see and what you will get. I do highly recommend this for a casual family meal outing
