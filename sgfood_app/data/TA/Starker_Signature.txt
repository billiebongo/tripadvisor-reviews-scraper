Nice beer, affordable price. Beautiful environment & decoration. Outstanding service from Desmond who let me sample 6 type of beers. This bar is right outside Tanjong Pagar MRT, & under high roof, good for hot or raining day. Crowded on Fri evening

difficult to get the attention of the service staff. Food was alright nothing great but I understand that other starker outlets serve different food

The food was average fare.. But at least the beer and ambience made for a better experience. Could have been quieter for indoors cos it was really noisy at times

Have been to starker@tpc twice and both experiences were great. Personal fan of their pork belly and knuckle (but it was a little salty). Spam fries were normal, seafood stew was surprisingly good too! And yes, their live music is pretty awesome too :)

The food and drinks was alright but the staff spam my call to confirm the reservation. I was on a call, thus i rejected that call, but the staff keep spaming nonstop until i pick up the call.

It was meant to be a birthday celebration/dinner. We spent more than an hour and in the end only the My Favourites Platter, Sweet Potato Fries and our drinks came. When we had almost finished the platter and fries, we asked the waitress to check on our order as we still have 2 Mains. And we continued to wait and wait (again) but the waitress never came back to us. We managed to get hold of the same waitress. She said she forgot to check on our order. After she came back, she told us,”the food was already served”. My friend asked, “do you see the food on our table then?”The waitress gave a shrug, ignored us and walked away! By then we were so disappointed that we decided to leave Starkers immediately! It was a very bad (first-time) experience at Starker Tanjong Pagar

This place is in a nice location in the new development next to Tanjong Pagar MRT.went with a friend for a drink / food in the evening mid week.This was my first visit.Impressions :Nice venue - bit noisy inside so sat outside Beer: own brewed beer in 3 or 4 varieties - tried both the standard lager and fruity tasting lager - which was basically a white beer. Both good.For DBS card holders beer was one for one- the normal price is a bit steep at around $19 all in for a pint - but at $9.50 very good value ( or approx $6 for half pint with 1 for 1)We ordered a 9 inch pepperoni pizza to share - was OK ... nothing special .Staff service varied - some staff quite good / others less interested.I would go back - but only with the beer ‘offer’ - would be a bit pricy at full price

With the 1-for-1 lunch deal, we ordered wagyu burger, prawn laksa pasta, seafood aglio olio, and a different presentation of carbonara. Top up $5 for 2 glasses of Christmas beverages. Quite worth the spend I would say. For those who like truffles fries, it's a must order cos every single piece was filled with truffles oil

The food taste/quality is not as good as Starker Hillview. The wagyu burger was very very dry, the carbonara taste a bit weird. The service is a bit slow, it took ages to request for water. The seating arrangement was weird; it’s not recommended if you are gg in a group more than 8pax

Attended a event with friends by Starker at Tanjong Pagar - Starker Music Carnival on 4 Nov 17 - we have been arranged to a table very, very near to the stage - and we have awesome experience, thank you. We ordered German Pork Knuckle, their signature dish and 2L of Lychee Beer - what a good combination. Location is wonderful, just above Tanjong Pagar MRT - will be back again soon

I have patronizing this outlet several times. The staff were friendly. I love going there because of the free flow beer.

For casual gathering with boss and oversea colleagues. Received great feedbacks from them. Shall recommend guests for a chill there.

Service was excellent with great food served. They were friendly to us despite the big group we had. Well planned for the birthday cake to be serve.

I went there for lunch with few friends joining. The place was empty but surprisingly service was slow. Food wise was just average quality. Didn't try the beer so I can't comment on it. It might be a place better for drinking rather than dining.

Went there on Saturday for lunch. Walk in as they are having a 1 for 1 lunch promotion for any day of the weekThe food was average for the fact they have a 1 for 1. Otherwise it is not value for money. The wagyu beef burger was actually beef patties and value at $25? Not value for money. The mushroom aglio olio was average at $16. I would not come back for it.For $5, we both have a cup of coffee and lemon grads tea.Overall, no way will I be back as the food are not tasty and vale for money.

The place is in a nice area, the personal work with good actitud and friendly but little cold , the food one of the worst I ever eat in Singapore in the last 5 years, expensive and small portions, the drinks good as any other is not made at site, coffee good just good.Was a waist of time and money stop in that place, for the price you fund in singapore excellent food.No more toSaid about this place set already in my black list a place to no stop again

Was checking out the food joints at Tanjong Pagar Centre and walked into this restaurant at about 12pm on Saturday. Was assaulted by the music and almost walked out immediately. Zack walked up and I asked if the volume could be turned down. "No problem". That attitude persuaded me to stay for lunch.Tried "Holy Cow", "Incredible pork" with mesclun salad and my kid had "Mushroom Aglio Olio".The "Holy Cow" was average but the quantity was wanting."Incredible pork" was tender and succulent but the sauce was overpowering.My kid enjoyed his noodles, and we appreciated that they agreed to remove all spice from the spaghetti.Service was mixed. Zack and his female colleague were helpful but his male colleague could have been more cheerful

Most of the restaurants at that area were full during lunch hour. Thus, we made a choice to try out this restaurant. We were brought to a table within seconds. The food was not bad with reasonable price. However, the service from the waiter or waitress will need some improvements or training. They just brought the bowl of food and left it on the table. Getting a a glass of iced water took them ages. Will not be in my list of choices either for lunch or dinner unless there isn't any choice to choose

I liked the ambiance and furniture. Staff is welcoming and helpful. Prices in medium/high range.Menu is Europe oriented with pizzas, pasta, salads and beer.StÃ¤rker fresh beer is a specific point as you can order up to 5 liters (barrel, SGD 148) among 5 different types (lager, dunkel, aromatic, charcoal and lychee
